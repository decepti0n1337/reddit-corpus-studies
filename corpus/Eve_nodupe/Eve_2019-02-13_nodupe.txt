I too wish for my CPU to melt its way to the center of the earth xD
---
---
---
Battleship abyssal sites when?
---
WTB X-type XLASB
---
CCP probably realized they were too generous at giving out free boosters and skill points in previous time-limited activities
---
The intent of this event is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment... you know the drill.
---
Hey, people asked for harder, more engaging PVE in eve... Anything that involves actively flying your ship with a good reward is a win in my book.
---
Newsflash: It isn't mandatory.
---
Best event ever
---
The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment...
---
You mean, the launcher update OP? You're double dipping in that pic.
---
#HOW DARE THEY ADVERTISE STUFF ON THEIR OWN GAME LAUNCHER!
---
I like this idea. Make it a special high slot mod for a new ship platfor: T2 ABCs!
---
5000 PLEX a month for Neocom skins coming next patch...
---
It's ironic that you think T2 linked 200km Rapiers work under total capital superiority, when it was actually PL themselves that taught us in Catch it doesn't.
---
RIGHT?
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
ahaahahaha ahahahah hahahhaha
---
excuse me
---
Because they already put them in the game and made them a key part of the event, they just don't want to hand out free SP at the rate they were before.
---
You need the ore to reprocess to get  Chromodo-dads  to turn in for loot boxes.
---
litteraly
---
killed a carrier in our hole with gilas lol. dropped fireworks and a ticket. im done.
---
It's lootboxes, soon you will be able to buy them with plex. We just need a youtube video of someone making 10bn Isk from 10 boxes ...
---
I lost my Orca because of this \*facepalm\*
---
unlike guns you can pre-activate drone recall xd
---
Like I always say, goons are just a space cult based on denial. Stop lying to yourself by streaming another attempt to looks legit you are just proving my point, and because as all goons dirty shit poster, you are too in denial to understand reality, I going to mute so I don't have to deal with you anymore.
---
(Who am I interpreting ? :D It begin with Olm and finish with eca_ego
---
Haha, this is awesome!
---
he is not even using isboxer/eve-o preview, I don't even know how he is not losing his mind xD
---
Sounds like I'm going to keep input broadcasting my Rorqs.
---
The beatings will continue until moral improves
---
I mean on the plus side people in my section of Gallente HS are too busy trying to make the event work to bother running all the combat anoms and sigs so I've been getting free reign of like 2 entire constellations to pick and choose what I want to run. Over 400m in deadspace and faction modules so far today.
---
Just bring back "events" that drop accelerators of 3 different size varieties.
---
Umm no.
---
And that's what the session change timer is :D
---
&gt; manually verify reports.
---
In a game where there are 30k people online at any given time, its actually not that hard.
---
10-20-30 targeted permanent bans a week and stringent rules and punishments to affiliated people would have a huge impact.
---
Just pointing out that they _have_ been dealt with. Relatively recently.
---
if you want to go with the 'how you sound' insult, how about "waaa! I know you did something about them, but I wanted more!" *foot stomp*
---
How much does that 1000 units reprocess into?
---
You have to hotkey overheat
---
You need max blinged paladin to run the them properly 
---
&gt; elseway do it in your firewall
---
This won't work for the same reason. You can't block eveonline.com and then connect to eveonline.com .....
---
So much this man. Remember the 1st events when loot cans were actually worth fighting over and people actually did even in HS ? Those were fun. Pure and simple.
---
Instead they fucking ruined them.
---
Lollll
---
4 -2 because 50% reprocessing. So you end up with 2, but with a structure and a ton of ore you'd get 60-65% depending on your skills. just you need so much ore for your skills to make a difference.
---
Can we get this back pls, it was a good one.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Rogue_Swarm_Alert_(2017)
---
If it’s been reinforced once it won’t reinforce again unless someone puts more stront in it. It the shields will regen themselves, should say under show info how long it will take, unless the owners rep it themselves to heal it up faster.

Ehhm, mission then?

morals never improve on the internet
---
ill upvote u bill
---
No as I did the entosiding with them we used frigates. 100's of em.
---
Tried out the test server. No way to get into the abyss. (No filaments on market) 
---
I’d imagine I have to wait for it to update or sync with my normal account (that does have some filaments) ? 
---
Dude, you're CSM, can't you pass it onto them to make these events fun again and stop fucking them up so incredibly ? 
---
The ones in the past before this whole mining bullshit were actually fun to do. Some of them were even difficult and ships have been lost, you can check killboards. Then they started this whole mining bullshit into them and it all went down the drain. 
---
I understand they wanted to include miners, which is cool,  but that doesn't mean they should have excluded everyone that doesn't mine or hates it in the process. Just give em some optional mining sites or whatnot so that miners could go mine and rest of us could go do what we do. Or something like that. 
---
No need for BPCs only bullshit.
---
We have to mine roughly 21 sites, after we have killed them, It can't be done on one account because the site will despawn the moment you leave it, so we need 2 accounts or an orca to do that, in order to build a single basic booster. How can this be intended?
---
rmt or bust.
---
"WE'VE ACHIEVED SOMETHING!" -actually ccp
---
I keep telling people to go watch this guy's stream. Go watch this guy's stream, he's awesome.
---
(leet pvp btw)
---
\&gt; sub accounts with plex bought via rmting. 
---
That part was a huge mistake. I feel like in the lore the Amarr would have probably hunted down and murdered everyone involved in an off-the-books cloning op.
---
Prewious event was abel to break 10/10 DED tanked T3Cs witch was terrible in design, this one can break them too and guess what? It has even shittieer rewards, good job CCP, way to go
---
hahahahaha
---
\#1 on gram
---
I don't even play anymore but this made me laugh out loud thinking about how this might impact folks in game. 
---
It isn't because of the RNG and the fact that material prices went way down. You'd have to get on average T5 cache with at least some sort of drop equivalent as loot, but you don't. Also, in addition to that if you run Exotic or Gamma it further cuts into that. Dark and fire are OK but a T2 fitted VNI is not a very good choice for surviving full neut spawn in dark or fire.
---
That would make this dumpster fire even worse
---
No.
---
We already learned this lesson.
---
Or do you think there’s a fuckton if people running the resource wars mining fleet empire NPC stuff?
---
Ads take up the same amount of space as before, as does the “useful” part. The only thing that’s changed is news, which now has pictures as well as text.
---
Why do they even care, isn't the rapture ~~tomorrow~~ next week or whenever anyway?
---
Fun fact: this is why they want to eliminate Palestine. Jews controlling Jerusalem is part of the lead up to the end times.
---
they were not fast, trimark diseased avatar brought down herd
---
There is no way to exempt yourself from player interaction. If you chose EVE to fulfill your solo farming dreams, you chose poorly. 
---
Event is complete shit I'm going back STO.
---
It's the pearl abyss effect everything will come from loot boxes you must buy...CCP is dying 
---
What skin is that?  I have a nail polish damn near the exact color.  Called Violet Femmes.
---
I was going to say fushia.
---
 
---
&gt;Is there a complete list of spawns for different tiers? Like there is eve-survival for missions but for abyssal sites.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Did CCP remove abyssal filaments from market on Singularity? I remember my friend telling me that he tested his abyssal fits on Singularity, but without filaments - how can i do it?  
---
&gt;Is Osprey Navy capable of doing these sites. I know everything can do T1, but what about T2 and T3?
---
You can do T2 filaments in a T2 fitted Osprey Navy, but not T3s. T3s, There are some spawns that will kill you. I recommend you look up on the official forums for more info, lotta specific stuff and fittings listed there. To give you a summary, best ship to run Abyss is Gila. Passive Gilas do very well up to T4 Gamma, Exotic and Electrical. Active Gilas do very well in Electrical, Exotic and Fire all the way to T5s. Some people like to run the passive with heavy blinged implants as well as ships and heavy boosters in T5s but they end up being very limited to filament types, mostly exotic and gamma.  Passive Gilas also have some trouble surviving some spawns due to the increased sig from all the shield mods. They take extra damage but are easier to fly, less overheating, less cap management.
---
Running purely exotic and gamma will severly cut into your income. You need to have some ships for the otehr filament types and sell off some, if not all, exotic and gamma filaments. Ships other then the Gila that can do Abyss: for Dark filaments best is Sacrilege. For fire you have a lot of options. Active Gila with therm hardener if T5 or no need hardener if below, Sac, Vedmaks, just to name a few. For electrical you can use active Gilas, Sac, vedmaks, Zealots, Phantasms. A few others but these are the main ones. Some people swear by Ishtars or Vagabonds or whatever else, but they're oddballs. If you wanna try it out go for it, if it works for you then great.
---
I was excited when i heard this event was coming back because i thought it was gonna be like that. 
---
This is why there is a market.
---
If you think it's worth it, buy the stuff of you don't want to move it yourself.
---
I don't think it ever did
---
Nope. Event is fucked.
---
Literally tldr
---
Its the skin you get from event rewards. I forgot its name, but you can bring up agency, check rewards, hit "show info" then hit the preview on it, check out the otehr ones when you do it too.
---
Awesome pink pew pew ships to match my pink mining ships. 
---
&gt;evetrade.space 
---
doesnt reallyu help you find helpful trades by region.
---
Some one will, and this will just make things more valuable.
---
Also, this isn't the first event requiring these, maybe some stock piles will be required for the future!
---
what is GESI ?
---
and how does google docs help?
---
Any site that drops agency boosters, accelerators, and forces warpins at beacon or prevents cynos being lit on grid is good in my book.
---
Everything else can pound sand
---
I dont get why every event is complete garbage in this game? Just make it worth it doing, without some stupid ISK sink mechanics.
---
Its not that grey anymore, there is plenty of precedence now. More like CCP lawyers are about as good at what they're doing as the dudes that do events and ship balancing. 
---
I think it was probably the gas from the last event. But something used scrapmetal.
---
TIL. thanks 
---
For years it's been combat based events, now there are some things available to others who enjoy other sides of Eve.
---
It's not fucked up, it's just not what you wanted.
---

---
was sceptical. went into a site. killed a carrier. got shit. went away.
---
So... that particularly male disability... fridge blindness. The inability to see the milk right in front of your damn nose... hey, honey, where's the milk...
---
That translates to the web. I'm not even sure I see adds anymore even if they are there. Checkmate launcher.
---
&gt;if I dont like how you think it is acceptable for me to attack you on the basis that I dont like your ideas.
---
Without some loss mails and explanations to see what exactly you screwed up its hard to say what you should do better. If you want to work on abyssals go watch the youtube videos for people who run them all day most will explain exactly how to clear the sites. If you are trying to pvp there are vids and streams for that. But without specific examples and killmails to go with them its hard to know what you need to work on.
---
Do you guys remember the arms race event. They gave away battlecruisers, battleships and boosters, I was pretty young when it happened but it set me up to push into my first billion... 
---
I think the problem is that they fired anyone that actually plays the game after their last string of product cancellations.  So, they're trying, but have no idea what people actually want.
---
Thank you for keeping to the narrative.
---
This was the best one,
---
First things first, Eve is a pvp game. Everything you do in it affects a player. But I digress.
---
Somewhere quiet, have you tried Amarr space? There are plenty of empty systems down there because it is far from Jita and because the Amarr Empire is large.
---
colloquially people refer to "Facebook stalking" as browsing a users old posts, and the behavior is seen as being in bad taste. Is it the same as digging through someone's literal trash? Obviously not, but on the spectrum on things that are stalking behavior, it is there.
---
the site has like a bajillion webs on you though
---
No.... shorty pay outs mining needed for boosters paying to open loot boxes just no
---
"facebook says that reading recent parts of a public post history is stalking so there"
---
facebook also says vaccines cause autism/death
---
They wanted to write "Eve development takes forever" but Pearl Abyss said no.

I know, right?  Reading this line made me roll my eyes.  Like, seriously, are you THAT out of touch, or are you just blatantly lying?  I'm not sure which I'd prefer TBH.
---
what they even drop now?
---
Careful, this community tends to fall hook, line, and sinker for publicity stunts.  See:  bot  teleporting, empty promises of communication, empty chat promises, etc.
---
lmfao
---
huh waht sov  systems are hold by russian?
---
How much did the price of tengu's jump since the event started?
---
Got the MWD version. I'm ahead on isk for this event now :)
---
nice
---
Nah, CCP is gone. They’re counting their money after cashing out. EVE is dieing. 
---
as far i know theres no big drops but a item you can gamble for loot. Also needed is minerals mined from asteroids in the eventsite and 13mil isk. theres no guarantee the loot you get from it is the same worth or more than the investment, most the time it is a loss.
---
Its a lot of both. They are completely out of touch and they lie to themselves and tell each other we love what they do.
---
I think a month or two is an over estimation. It will last a few weeks, then one of things they declare fixed/finished will break the community will link them to the page showing it was complete and we will never see the page updated again.
---
&gt;theres no guarantee the loot you get from it is the same worth or more than the investment, most the time it is a loss.

Sounds like resource wars all over again
---
No cat anything = GOOD

This is basically a duplicate of https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/apzwxu/ccp_wtf_is_this_gala_crap_i_am_isk_negative_and/ which is on the front page. Please take it there, friend.
---
price of garbage going to go up if it cost this much to make it?
---
You're playing a sandbox game with a full-fledged market. I reiterate: It isn't mandatory.
---
Well they better come up with better things to stick in the loot boxes then.
---
Gave it only a quick glance cause I'm limited on time, however, this seems like a really good resource with thought and care put into it that will undoubtedly help newer players out.
---
A+. Will come back and finish reading

I know the compact damage mods is definitely one I probably overlook or dont consider most often when fitting is tight. Was a good read and I'll have to get out and actually try fits more often!

---
you are indirectly if you get your isk by buying and selling PLEX
---
I think it would be interesting for these to act under the same mechanism as mobile cyno inhibs. Up timer so that the effects aren’t immediate, but also in effect until they are destroyed not X amount of time
---
They are even selling the fireworks on the in-game store this even is such a joke its sad.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/HACzXia](https://imgur.com/a/HACzXia)
---
Here is a gallery that might explain it better
---
Rude !
---
In the half dozen or so threads on this event today I have seen exactly one person saying they made money and it was on a single faction item they got from one of the loot boxes. So if your ok with RL lottery like odds this is the event for you, otherwise it seems to be a pass.
---
I did solo the rats in my Gila. But then again I don't play passively and can do some decent stuff in it.
---
The rats are not the issue at all, only problem was after immediate launch because the dude misplaced a decimal point, so the BS had literally 10x the ROF it was supposed to, which has been fixed now.
---
The problem is its now POS as far as overall content goes, and that POS doesn't stand for Player Owned Structure in this case and context. Mostly the events were pretty nice up until they started these shitty BPC and mining shit in them. Now they are all fucked up, some of it is because of mining, I just can't bring myself to partake in such horrid shit, and am not alone. I know there are some people who do enjoy it, OK, but that doesn't mean it needs to be pushed up everyone elses ass that doesn't.
---
The bigger problem is overall these things were actually kinda fun before. People would fight over drops, bitch, moan, pull all kinds of shenanigans, all that is gone now. And that has nothing to do with Gilas, it has everything to do with ubber shitty design.
---
That sounds more plausible tbh
---
As an elite null bear I am disgusted you are still permitted to even discuss faction war. I mean those missions only exist for financing supers anyway, whats the point in wasting updates.
---
lol cupcake 
---
I'm betting on the Barghest, if you can keep the guac from slipping off.
---
The Hel might work quite nicely if you turn it upside down.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
I just can't believe people are still complaining about ads on a launcher. 
---
As I understand it, the issues have diminished drastically in the past month, so it might be that all they can do is iterate as issues arise. If it’s working well now, they can definitely afford to prioritize other things.
---
They are claiming its fixed again.
---
The problem with the resource wars shit is that somehow everyone involved came to the amazing idea that it should be isk and time negative because mining.
---
The irony remains palpable.
---
either they dont want to . or they cant do anything . CCP never say
---
&gt; It'd probably cut down on the spam
---
how would not destroying them do that?
---
I think he's actually somehow removed from the irony of his own shitty posting, like he seriously believes this shit, imagine living life that way
---
you mean stations?  xD
---
Cause it takes for fucking ever and if people know that they're basically handing free real-estate to the enemy they might not do it so much.
---
You mean... Outposts? They [used to be called Outposts](https://www.eveonline.com/article/p85rmg/faction-citadels-the-details). And then those went away, and became Citadels.
---
You're working backwards, man.
---
Correct.
---
I was making fun of all the morons who said basically what I said in response to people complaining about carrier balance. Thanks for completely missing the point
---
Hataks can launch a lot more fighters than a super and coupled with their high damage weapons, I'd say a super would lose to 2 hataks.
---
You will make slightly more selling locally but it may sell slowly or not at all. Set up a sell order in perimeter, and it will sell in minutes (you may need to watch it and play the .01 game a few times but it will sell) or sell to a buy order in perimeter for 3-4% less if you cant be assed to watch it for 5 mins. 
---
Don't you still have to burn to the gate, which you sort of can't do sieged?
---
You should be able to entosis unanchor them if unfueled. 1 whole day to abort the unanchoring process so...
---
You can unsiege marauders you know... 
---
I would fly a marauder in an abyssal site similarly to L4 missions. Skip the siege and just blap when you're fighting against small stuff, but if you hit a situation with entirely too many battleships or too much dps, then go ahead and siege a cycle or two. 
---
There will be plenty of people who accidentally siege within 60 seconds of the timer finishing, so the killmails will be glorious reading material.
---
What accelerators?
---
It's like the Triglavian logs, except it doesn't even yield anything good besides that.
---
This would be no solution to the "M size structure spam", it will just change the owner, not the number of structures in space/game.
---
I would like to introduce something else:
---
When you entose a low power structure (and it will only work at low power) it overrides its self-destruction protocol and starts a 5-7 day timer, only visible to the entosing pilot. The owner can stop it, by just clicking on a reset button in the structure brower, if not, structure is gone, with killmail and loot....
---
Due to how broken flying your ship becomes in TIDI fights the caps usually can't relocate without jumping out and back in forcing them to reload a max tidi grid which is the same as feeding your cap fleet would be dumb and discourage fights.
---
You can point it out, I don't care. I'm not a fan of botters either. I'm just sort of playing devils advocate to a specific part of this issue that people are lumping in. People here tend to get too obsessed with alliance interests or propaganda that they openly brandish double standards with things they, in reality, probably aren't okay with. But if it's "their guy" suddenly every angle imaginable comes out of the woodwork. 
---
&gt; But then again...they are paying customers...so why should CCP give 2 shits...
---
Having too many bots results in things like, for example, reddit going into uproar and spreading to gaming news sources. This, in turn, hurts CCP's ability to attract new or returning players to the game. It also scares off existing players from the game and discourages some players who do stay from spending any money on the game. One fat whale with a plex problem being scared off is going to hurt CCP a hell of a lot more than 100 bot accounts and in some cases far, far more... and that's before all the other stuff mentioned. CCP is definitely financially motivated to kill bots / botters, especially so now that new players are coming into newbie spots asking "is this game OK to play? I hear its infested with bots so I dont want to spend too much time if it is."
---
   
---
You can use it. Believe me, I often do that. 
---
So more lag with little to no effect on the outcome besides making TIDI fights more aids. Yeah that's exactly what we need.
---
Yes it is probably the pilot - when the crate randomises the loot, it checks "oh, Goon! Grr Goon! I will give him worst shit loot ever!", that is how it works.
---
Plot twist: I was not running it on my Grr Goon character.
---
You got my nomination for CSM
---
Sir, you are a gentleman and a scholar. Please post more. 
---
I dont think they are much more durable than eve battleships. Atleast in my mind 3 shots per long range fighter would take one down.
---
Most capital ships are able to tank thousands of gigatons worth of damage for a sustained amount of time. I think eve ships have a pretty good chance of taking them down
---
kusion special team streams? :O Thanks big bill. 
---
Nyx should be massive tank and no dda. This way can be saved by strong fax blob built by many rorq. 
---
Nyx must be slow. Fast nyx bad. 
---
mmmmm that strawman
---
They didn't really *become* Citadels. CCP just deleted the Outposts and plopped fancy Fortizars in their place. 
---
Kind of like if they came and removed your PS4 from your living room and left a new smart-phone in it's place. I mean, sure, technically the smart-phone is newer tech and you can play games on it... but it's definitely a downgrade.
---
Good example would be sgu first episode when a few hatak were able to nearly destroy the general hammond which in terms of weaponry and defense id closer to an eve super as it can take down an ori mothership.
---
death gliders are single seat two gun attack craft, that would be like trying to kill a nyx with a few hundred no tank rifters, while the nyx is throwing 3 groups of Al'kesh sized ships and 2 groups of cruiser sized ships at you and msart bombing your gliders the second they get within range which they have to do thanks to their point shoot weapons, I go with the supers winning even when moderately outnumbered. Hataks also have a pretty bad track record when confronted with high powered energy weapons like what you would find on dreads. Unless they massive outnumbered the dreads I would expect the hataks to lose.
---
BUT JIBRISH EVERY GOON IS OBVIOUSLY A BOT SO U CAN'T SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT BOTTING BCUZ UR A GOON!!!!!!!!!
---
BLEEP BLOOP
---
Excellent as always stitch. 
---
Your complete inability to do anything else than repeat yourself 4 times in a row without providing any argument or content beyond "you're dumb, I am very smart, please just accept this" is still hilarious and the true ironical thing here.
---
In the world of computers, nothing becomes anything else. Values change, and data comes and goes.
---
But they migrated over all the contents, and the ownership, and the functionality. So yeah... the Outposts turned into Citadels.
---
That's all irrelevant though. The point was that OP wants Outposts back. But that's not how things usually go. You don't evolve from those, into this, and then bring those back.
---
/u/PA_Falcon_Awakened 
---
Would only take 1 Alkesh. Have the jffa quickly board the super and use a zaknikatel on the pod. Game over.
---
I could live with hataks and wraith hive ships being on equal footing with npc dreads and carriers. Seems like a pretty good comparison. I know what you mean about hataks weapons being inconsistent at best. Some episodes when they do orbital bombardment the weapon seem less powerful than hand grenades but you also get one off remarks about gigaton blasts.

Have to get past the shields and the 4-5 thousand crew members

Ah okay I understand now

reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

CCP is just coming up with new ways to address the ISK Faucet problems in the game.  Thank you  for playing .

Why not have it that you can entosis Seraph and stop him from having shit ideas or posting in general
---
Has anyone tried speed tanking and mining with a Venture/Expedition frigate? This might not be as terrible if the frigates could mine it quickly but IDK.
---
So not only are you incapable of anything but snide high school level ad homs, but you're fond of blatant lying as well?

I mean... what is the idea here, this isn't something that's hard to check? Surely you can do better?
---
The event is going great - for the Guardians
---
400mil in a day compared to lots of other things you could do doesn't seem great. Unless by day you mean a couple hours or something.
---
It just seems like this "special event" isn't so special. 
---
Removing half the systems in eve, to start.
---
You can shoot them at strategic times.
---
The gate doesn't work for like 8 hours after first reinforce.
---
Dropped the ball hard, what’s the test server?
---
Yeah this was over maybe 4hr but only like 60-90min of that wasn't just dicking around in chat so it was 400m in under 2hrs of actual work.
---
by evidence did you mean the youtube video where you can clearly see drones appearing on different ticks and not all at once like a broadcasters drones would? Posting a video showing someone who knows how hotkeys work is not the same thing as posting evidence of broadcasting. But you wouldn't know it based on the amount of anti-goon REEEEEEEEing on reddit.
---
I dunno man
---
A standard eve carrier is 36 SS fighters
---
Hatak would get defanged pretty quick
---
The real question becomes how fast once that happens can the 27 dps fighters bring down a hatak, and thats just a normal carrier.
---
I honestly think a super could nuke one with a single heavy fighter torp set.
---
watch this get ignored along with all the rest
---
This is why I don't do events - I'd rather make more ISK doing other stuff and just buy the event items from people. 
---
could be worse he could be using rorquals
---
how do you know he isn't?
---
Just wait till you start roaming null, youll keep that window up ;)
---
I liked the recording of that last cap feed where you can hear him constantly talking over the shot callers to repeat the same two lines of info like 10 times.
---
The complete ignorance of this comment is mind blowing.
---
I was running T3's a month ago, did about 50 filaments and got the PvP room twice. Wasnt worth it
---
&gt; In wormhole, i often use d-scan, and sometimes i'm lazy so i have binded an auto-hot-key script to press V every second.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Is it allowed ?
---
smart goon/dino/global pandemic (didn't we cure those) would say "hello i want to rent some space for my afk rorqual friends, they're very lucky keep coming back right in time to recall drones is this good?"
---
They may respawn in other systems
---
Stay strong , also alphas fly gilas.
---
All of them. Open cyno, drop friends/pets, wipe the field, then whine on reddit about how capital proliferation is killing the game
---
The number of people who enjoy these gala event sites
---
I liked the minmatar one, you had some hacking, which was boring, but also fighting between players over battleship wrecks. Only problem was it being confined to Amarr space 
---
Is it limited to constellation or region?  Or just random?  
---
All of them because that one Hatak is actually being piloted by SG-1 and Major Carter is planning on 1vAll'ing them at the sun, Carter style
---
I can, anchoring up on the FC and pressing F1 to the targets he/she calls. Then bragging about how you're smashing the opposition. Honestly cracks my shit up.
---
No, he definitely literally spent 24 hours straight without break running sites.
---
Agree with you 100%
---
The event isn't that awful, but the rewards are shit, the mining is shit, the BPC requirements are shit, the drops are shit, the effort required is shit and the event spawn rate is shit. 
---
It gets a POS code/10
---
though the EULA specifically states that isk has zero real world monetary value. No clue if that would hold up in court. Since there is no legitimate way to convert isk back into money they might have a decent shot.
---
Pretty much. 
---
Yea building boosters is dumb and too complicated.  Just want to run sites and loot wrecks.
---
SGU suffered from a critical lack of writers remembering the content of past shows, for example Daedalus class vessels had zero issue deleting hatak class vessels in later seasons of SG-1 and in Atlantis they regularly vaporize wraith ships with a single shot. 
---
"It's not mandatory... well, someone literally has to do it in order for it to be possible, but it's mandatory."
---
This is like saying farming isn't needed because you buy food at the fucking store.
---
&gt;Stargate doesn't do a whole lot of measuring either. 
---
Carter regularly explained how many times more powerful Naguadah enhanced weapons were.
---
This event is strange: it's the first one I've ever seen in my limited experience where CCP seems to discourage our involvement.
---
a) Early runners got blapped by a typo. Ok, it happens, should have been caught, but it happens. Should have been caught though. We all know this.
---
b) Miners have little to do. There's 7500m3 of stuff to collect and refine. And the refining rate is ludicrously low.
---
c) We are expected to return that very precious refined commodity (I had some stored from previous events), with 13M ISK, to be rewarded with random stuff. I'm trying to be polite here.
---
I have no problem with the events gameplay - moderately challenging blapping is good! But the rewards are so absurdly terrible, I'm wondering if CCP is trying to wean us off the event/accelerator habit, while trying to set a precedent for the loot box concept.
---
Normally, I remain silent when I'm disappointed by CCP - I don't want anyone to get fired over what might just be a rushed event that they wanted to squeeze in before something more important, as a sort of a time-filler.
---
But I also wonder: is this catastrophic event a cry for help? What's going on?
---
at least it was fun... to watch killboards before bs boss fix.
---
As someone who plays black desert online (owned by pearl abyss) get ready for some really fucking bad "events"
---
Weren't very good at it eh?
---
The injector accelerators last time were pretty damn amazing.  I used 30 skill injectors over that event and got the full 15 million points.
---
mandatory mining is one thing and not entirely a bad idea, but mandatory mining for HOURS to get the tiniest little sliver of  a reward is pure cancer.
---
who the hell keeps their isk in jita?
---
unfortunately the pay is so shit no one is going to mine those rocks with the purpose of selling them given the amount of effort required for such a tiny pay out.
---
I think Goon flair makes you more eligible for CSM than less. It's all in the Imperium after all.
---
r/whowouldwin
---
making mining mandatory isn't a bad idea if they combine that with capital blocking gates, this would get exhumers back out in the belts for people to hunt. But with refine numbers like the ones this event has its like CCP is trying to troll anyone willing to mine the sites.  
---
That's 5 hours of grinding the event? Thank god i'm playing in the USTZ and can just avoid wasting time on this shit show entirely.
---
I'd rather have a small spike in T1 ships, effective boosters, than getting pissed on like this. Just a bitter vet 
---
Just because it didn't get broken to our detriment that something was broken to our benefit... :)
---
Rabble rabble rabble!
---
??? wut. Its painfully easy, how can you not be good at doing that lol. I felt it was boring as fuck, and it made it worse when fellow teammates would brag afterwards. The fact I have to explain that twice is telling :D.
---
I wish I could unview.
---
&gt; This is a bad post
---
Hey I agree and want to throw you a wild idea: how about you delete it?
---
With everyone complaining about faucets in the game CCP added an isk/time sink. CCPlz make events great again!
---
biomass your reddit account.
---
lol just plan ahead dumbass bring 200 friends as support??
---
Imagine not having 200 friends as some wormholer lol
---
Dead meme lol
---
So is LSH
---
He’s not all there, be nice.
---
If all you want to do is krab and press f1 and be part of big battles, then there's no reason not to join some big blob. Have fun with eve if that's what you're after, I'm not judging 
---
Yea its bad.  Don't know why CCP can't just make accelerators drop in wrecks.  Obviously those are the most fun/popular.
---
The funny thing about fcs is they exist when people step up.
---
There's no magic training to be an fc, you just step up and do it. 
---
Agreed 
---
Rewards are shite, gameplay is shite, it’s like grinding the same single pocket mission over and over again, throw in necessary mining on top of all that. 100% fail
---
Not only that, but good luck finding sites in null. The VIP sites are pretty much undoable, I found 3 normal sites in hours looking in a decent range from home.
---
I like this.
---
shut the fuck up GOON
---
says the retard that came crying in eve discord that you guys aren't botting. Living rent free in your head bill.
---
You didn’t miss out on anything
---
Did the ships blow up when a patch backfires?
---
These snowflake millenials just have no idea Gorski... they have no idea how good they have it.
---
For mtu maybe
---
Idk, I mean i only did a couple of sites, and have made well over 100m just making the bpcs that dropped. Maybe I just got lucky. I haven't even done the ticket thing.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
That's down to luck tho, really. I found 5 normal sites and a VIP site in my home system right after DT, plus several more in the neighboring systems.
---
Too bad I have no plans of running this event lol
---
to me, you just seem like some weird dude, crouched on the ground, shoveling shit in his mouth and raving about how great it tastes and why would anyone complain about having to eat it
---
This would be a fun question for /r/whowouldwin as well. 
---
That would be amazing, I'd break 1b/day easy doing that 😂
---
" I think they fired the guy that actually collects feedback, too, if they ever had one. " That was a bot form the beginning, but it broke several years ago and they fired the guy who used to fix it.
---
Make an OP. This makes sense!
---
Or if you fly a Marauder, which amounts to the same thing.
---

Absolute disgrace
---
They are so cheap, people still drop them as throw away bases, not really counting on them surviving.
---
Tight click -&gt; report bot.
---
It may not do anything, but who the fuck will know.
---
I'm just glad I'm not the only one re watching stargate. Comments here are gold
---
what a magical fit.
---
Or just smart enough to not only members to arm their enemies
---
It looks random. You can find systems with 4 sites if you are lucky
---
I support this.  Big Stargate fan here.  (If you couldn't tell by the name) 
---
The event chan has been more entertaining, than the event itself Salty As fuck in there...much fun 
---
But I was told [greed is good](https://youtu.be/VVxYOQS6ggk) so now I'm just confused.
---
This guy gets it!
---
Best event to date. But any type of event with ungated sites, doable in a destroyer and decent rewards would do. 
---
I'll wait a day or two, it seems that sometimes CCP will tweak a few nobs to improve events, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. 
---
Thank you for the kind words.
---
Killing a carrier graciously netted me a Log Fragment and a meta kinetic shield ward. I don‘t expect dank ticks but at least a drop worth more than the missiles I used.
---
Maybe this time they're trying to reduce the number of them being used or something? Not sure.
---
But I'm relatively sure that they had a goal in mind with these particular quantities, we might just not know it yet :)
---
All the frigates web you while all the cruisers paint you. Speedtanking won't be easy.
---
CCP didn't cash out lol.  CCP is what was sold to Pearl Abyss.  The investors that started CCP cashed out.
---
If 1 character is grr goon all characters are grr goon.
---
god damn it i miss stargate :(
---
Can't use Gila. Not good event.
---
if you compare it to regions like, Venal, Curse or Syndicate, it's really apparent this area can actually have good content.
---
if you perform multiple actions across multiple accounts within a single tick, it all looks the same to CCP in the server log, doesn't matter if you're using "one key one action" (which is not something CCP ever said is ok, it's a rule in Runescape, not Eve), round-robin or no external software at all. if you get reported, you'll get banned. it's happened to people who only do stuff like this guy with no macros.
---
CCP knows this system is flawed, otherwise it would ban people automatically and not require a report and manual review of the server logs.
---
Lol you people still play this game.
---
If you had paid attention in the past CCP has previously said they want to be able to provide that but I doubt its at the top of their priority list.
---
It's partially due to a few very key things.  
---
First off, there are lots of stations, and they are fairly well spread thru the whole area.  
---
Second, they are many missions for LP in the majority of the region. Its decent income (or was, if you arent multiboxxing rorqs/carriers).  
---
Third, the entire region is considered "true sec" so there are best opportunities for officers / bounties.  
---
Compare this to one of the worst regions IMHO, Great Wildlands (Which I spend over a year in).  
---
(shoutout oldschool NRDS, long live g0rgon/Duck Dodgers one of the coolest FC's ever)
---
At least they're updating the right way
---
you're looking at jumps with in the last hour, that's not a good indication of anything.
---
If you want content in anyone of these area you go to the primary mission running constellations. Simply because of the fact that, that is where the people are. 
---
Take venal for example out of the 52 system 7 have stations, spread out in 4 Constellation's that are all right next to one another. For the average person there is actually no reason to go out to the further system's.
---
7 tickets = domination capital cap battery , 7% and 3% web range implant, some trash boosters and skins,  i dont complain, having fun and dont spending more time in game then usual - for me other kind of content,
---
tho i dont care about my isk/hr ratio if i dont having fun with sth i just dont do it
---
tho i dont care about u guys but bit sick of amount of shit constantly posted here about game - hey CCP u make event and i didnt make my shit ton of bilion isk/hr with it..
---
sorry for my bad english
---
Eve is dying? That's a catchy new memetrope I've never come across before. You should rush to the nearest copyright lawyer. 
---
You should've called it a feature.
---
*distant Below the Asteroids*
---
Caught you in the middle of setting up a POS on a moon I had also found, out there years ago. Tried to kill it, but I was just a single idiot in a Niddy. The NRDS group that lived in M-MD3B seemed about dead by that time, had flown with them some before, was fun. Cant remember any names.
---
Do the Ha'Taks have standard Goa'uld shields or are they using Anubis' enhanced shields?
---
Dinobrain
---
That moonwalking nyx was fast. I had 80 warp disrupt probes on scan at one point. 
---
Twas definitely a fun drop. See you next time.
---
Yeah this event is total fail...
---
The trap played out nicely. Worth staying up. 
---
And frankly I fail to comprehend why it's low on the list. Adding things like killmarks, skin used and ship name would go a long way to make killmails much more personal and interesting.
---
To cater to the miners obviously. Winds of change.
---
CCP: "bUt wHaT aBoUt tHe MiNeRs"
---
lel look at him still being mad for not getting recognition for that rage thingy. 
---
Thanks for the comprehensive answer!
---
However, I'm not sure I understand what you meant by
---
&gt;Running purely exotic and gamma will severly cut into your income
---
Also, what if I bling-fit NOsprey a bit? Will it survive T3s? Approximately how much bling am I looking at?
---
P.S. I don't want to use Gila because I find Gila boring to fly, and I just love NOsprey.
---
NEIN! 
---
"Oh god it didn't fit, I think I might be bleeding from there now."
---
Excellent analogy! I guess I didn't make this clear enough: I am not trying to state that nobody has to mine. I am stating that *the people who hate mining* don't have to mine. I would have a similar reaction if my friend got upset that farming is required to produce the popcorn he wants to eat. He doesn't have to farm it. I interpreted the comment I responded to as being from someone upset that they--personally--were being required to mine in order to get accelerators.
---
If you offer to pay more, they'll mine it for you. :-) Or am I missing something about how our EVE market economy works these days?
---
[laughs in mandarin] 
---
3 years ago there were better events than this where groups of 10 or so cruisers would invade a region like an incursion style thing. They were sometimes hard to catch but when you blew them up they dropped like 500 mil worth of loot and even gave you a shiny killmail. And I don't know how CCP managed it but every time this event happened it was totally different, like nothing was scripted. The NPCs were all named and they even had some advanced AI or something that would smacktalk in local. I don't understand how CCP went from something that impressive to these Gala events. 
---
they did a survey on events a while ago and like every question seemed to imply players wanted blueprints from event sites. gotta think about the miners I guess!
---
howabout a bubblefucked smartbomb fortizar in line with every gate
---
when you have to clear double digit sites to build a single booster they are going to want to be compensated for their time and no one is going to pay that much for a single +6 booster when injectors are a thing.
---
I liked your suggestion (I think it was you) that incursion constellations should always have a wormhole to Stain or have an increased chance of them. They could make it a unique type that has incursion rats spawn on it or whatever.
---
Did a site once to see what was what... was pretty to see the skinned Astra... looked at the rewards... looked at the mining requirements to build the booster... or roll the dice with the Astra  "Yeah, nope."  This event is DOA unless the mining reqs is sorted out. Time investment vs reward is ridiculously skewed. 
---
Remember the T2 BPO event?  
---
\&gt; Why dude? Just build your own wormhole you can shoot DDs out of. 
---
funny how you completely missed the point. Your idea of an unavoidable DD is broken. If it has a fair warning and I can avoid being hit reasonably well, then I would be very much fine with it (funny how you didn't read that statement btw). 
---
It's also funny that you think that the umbrella is this level of retarded OP'nes. Tell me one thing: if you really believe that, how are you able to bind your shoes in the morning? Oh I see, Velcro. :) 
---
\&gt;Just like my hypothetical point about wormhole DDs right? 
---
Your hypothetical point about Wormhole DD's proposed an I-win button you can't defend against nor can you avoid it. Tell me how that is equivalent to A superumbrella you a.) know is there, b.) you can see coming from miles away by the cyno and c.) you can counter with enough capitals of your own. 
---
If these 3 conditions (warning, avoidable, counterable) are met for your WH doomsday, then go ahead. According to your suggestion, they aren't and it would be broken by every definition of balance. The same can not be said for supers though and even if you can somehow demonstrate that it is, then why do you want, instead of nerfing capital umbrellas to make it easier for you to deal with them, remove the only line of defense a PvE player has in the absence of an alliance? 
---
The answer to that is: because you hate other playstyles and because these PvE'ers are 99.9999% of the content you seek so very much: Easy kills. 
---
Proof me wrong.
---
  
---
\&gt; Good so you understand now that cheaper shit doesn't mean better. "But it makes ships cheaper" is not an argument either.  
---
less value is not equivalent to no value. Glad that you understood the point. Oh wait, you failed at that again. Sad thing. 
---
\&gt; Correlation does not equate to causation. Nothing in the MER says X is happening because of Y in regards to mining causing more pvp. 
---
Well, then give me another conclusion to the cause for the clear numbers on the MER. I've asked you for such a conclusion 20 times already. You refused to adress that. Give me your conclusion on why these numbers are the way they are and why the start of the production/destruction increase was the day rorquals became good at mining. Before you say "I did that already" to dodge that argument again.
---
How else would you explain the rise in production and destruction since the day of the rorqual changes then? Alphaplayers maybe? Do you really want to use that as an argument?
---
\&gt; It was your point that having easier krabs as targets would draw more roaming gangs out. There are "plenty of roaming gangs out now" has no metric. how many is plenty? Did you count it? No. You're just making things up. 
---
I suggested that *may* happen. What your point fails to adress is: how does that equate to more PvPer vs PvPer fights when they clearly don't want that. They don't do it now, so why do you think that would change if you would have even less content generators (aka pve'rs) in space because the higher risks makes people opt out of it? 
---
It doesn't make sense. 
---
\&gt;How do you know they don't want it? What should they do? Siege 1DQ with a small gang? Start taking Keepstars?
---
Because they don't do it now and removing local wouldn't help with adressing the reasons why they don't. They don't do it because they don't have the tools and manpower to have a realistic chance at succeeding. It's simple and I've said that time and time again really. It get's old that you still insists it's anything else.  
---
 \&gt;Yes and this is a testament to the quality of pilots, not the balance of the game. 
---
It's also testament against your claim that "nothing can be done" against it. 
---
\&gt;They do. But for example if you go to Delve you don't have fights with other groups. Last night we rolled our wormhole into Delve. The moment we jumped in all the Rorquals instantly drew in their drones, warped to citadel and that was that. We managed to snag a Retribution. Molok wipes into system and sets up boson on the gates. There's no content to fight. Local makes certain everyone just docks up. Nobody will actually fight. 
---
So your point is: You are too dumb to bubble some unprepared rorquals and it's the games fault. And you talk about skill lmao. 
---
\&gt;You should actually roll a new character and try to do small gang.  
---
it's legitimately boring. Hunting PvE'ers for the chance of getting an Ego boost out of winning a fight stacked in my favor. I certainly don't find that exciting. On the flipside, roaming brave space and waiting to get dropped on at a gate to see how much we can take out is fun. But you don't do fights you can't win so what would you know about that. 
---
hang on let me get my magnifying glass to view this shit post
---
Yep it was quite fun idea. 
---
When did you last time asked CCP for it  ? :D
---
The push for alts in mining ships is just insane recently 
---
ah, that.
---
i guess you are right.
---
thanks, that's nice
---
Gold. You show your nick is correctly chosen
---
Assuming I care what all the other idiots here on reddit think of me :D
---
The most powerful Doomsday device [the earlier versions] put out about half a Hiroshima bomb’s worth of energy.
---
This is not a toy, I would expect something more of a bang though.
---
The concept of making it more difficult to hold over-size territory is fine. Fatigue however is a shit system designed by a known moron, that punishes people for having fun and playing the game. It's been rolled back because everyone recognizes it was making things incredibly stagnant to just sit in your space and never go anywhere.
---
___
---
IMHO it will never be possible to completely fix the way that alliances hold too much space &amp; have to form coalitions with their neighbors, no matter what happens with "power projection". The core problem is the map makes it impossible to be a small, independent entity in the sov game. A region is the smallest block of space that is possible to occupy, and plenty of regions can't even do that.
---
&gt; But we don't really know where a "nuke" would fall in the realm of Eve either.
---
But we do know: the DDD is listed as needing a number of gigawatts [too lazy to look it up right now] to engage it, and that amount of power is about half the bomb that took out Hiroshima [it’s in the description].
---
So you can actually speak to that, because CCP have documented it.
---
You just say that so you can have all the sites for yourself. I am on to you!
---
If you're talking about the vile swarms, don't kill the drones themselves, just kill the vedmaks and damaviks that are spawning them. As for your other losses - always go for neuting ships first; whenever I have died in the abyss it was because of neuts. If you can quickly and reliably kill the neut ships in every pocket, even the pockets that have more of them, the abyss will be much easier in general.
---
I thought they were characters played by ISDs
---
Upstairs brain department responds at a glacial pace.
---
It's perfectly readable, though? If anything, the text is a bit too large. 🤔
---
Sov isn't anything. They're as strong as ever, and the eviction actually helped their activity grow again with the change of pace. The 'remainder' of HK is a bit of a misnomer since they definitely haven't lost out.
---
I know for a fact it is generally incorrect.
---
If the game changes every week, and those changes affect the bot, then yes, but that is obvious. An unstable process is difficult to automate. Otherwise no.
---
You're also 4 jumps away from GE-8, Brave's Catch staging. Where there's usually cotent to be had.
---
woo, lottery tickets
---
Sup Pearl Abyss game designers, how is it going?
---
click on a picture you ~~fucking idiot~~ respectable eve online player and you can zoom in\\out easily
---
That hasnt always existed tho ;)
---
No. This is free intel. Why should you have it?
---
Check the ship before you kill it if you want that info.
---
This is project discovery, not the activity tracker :) 
---
http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=Gesi+eveonline
---
Is CCP using eve to simply troll players these days?
---
Maybe thats why the bots arent banned.
---
Sounds like fun shenanigans to me!
---
Oh I see, the star catalog thing, thanks for explaining.
---
What intel does it provide? Lmao
---
What info did you ask for?
---
Even we think this is bullshit
---
Stupid bird, the only way to play eve is in a 2000 person alliance with 100 Rorqs out at all times 
---
&gt;No. This is free intel.
---
That^
---
I miss blink
---
same here, as a new player even if i need those accelerators i don't even bother doing it, it's annoying as fu\*\* making accelerators craftable was a good idea on paper but removing the lootable accelerator wtf x\_x
---
i'm not taking a hand off my dick to click on a picture
---
17m^3 /s with a Covetor.
---
Color me less than impressed. Your problem is your mining skill. You’re always going to lose % in the reprocessing. The profit is in mining a shit ton of whatever it is you’re mining. 
---
The profit in mining is all about volume.
---
Intel on how many sods that ship killed before i killed it? Is that even intel?
---
It is info that you want provided for no particular reason. If you decide not to look at the ship, why should you know anything about its history?
---
This will be yet another data point used by zkb and semi-cheating programs like pirates little helper (if its still around).
---
I'm guessing this event is to test metrics and see at what point people will give up and not participate. 
---
Because in the heat of battle I want to stop and look at every ship I'm shooting or god help me if I'm not on max graphics. Still have yet to state a downside to a kill just showing "x killmarks" I've lost some ships with 50-60 killmarks, or the caedes I lost that had around 200. Just makes the kill more interesting.
---
What if there was a bunch of stations in nullsec that you could actually take like sov and then just fuel all the services for it????????
---
It is nothing, but is something they base out of to back your supers escalations.
---
Its a PR post anyway
---
It’s all about the implants
---
There will be new structures to replace POS, FOB they're called.
---
That would actually make a lot of sense. 
---
Concord plates go for 300-350m last I checked, other faction capital mods normally sell for more, but idk what the drop rates on those is, may be really cheap
---
Bring back t2 bpo lottery 🥳
---
GERREADY BOIS, **IT'S VELDSPARDAY!!** 
---
Do they come from the points? I saw the ugly skins, some fireworks, and 2 booster blueprint cases. Don't recall seeing the implant above the progress bar.
---
Yeah I would park this e-peen-ometer reading right at the very back of things that need changed.
---
I would much rather see Logi appearing on killmail and BRs first before they changed anything else about killmails.
---
Or EVE Online.
---
I looked at it hoping it would a juicy target region.  You can have my salt.
---
Cry me a river. He tried to defect. He goonfucked on the way out. You reap what you sow.
---
Nah, they can be obtained from the loot boxes
---
if its like previous ones, it will get put on the account to be redeemed by the character of your choice.
---
Those plates have same stats like CONCORD so assuming that you can sell them for **MUCH** more is bad.         
---
From what i see you paid 500mil for stuff worth 500mil :D (170mil + 350mil - taxes and not perfect sell orders).         
---
CCP need to really rethink what they put into those crates - as annoying customer that buys a product that suppose to offer fun ... is bad business. 
---
This is brilliant!
---
Embrace the meme!
---
Take it inside of you and be one with the meme!
---
That is the path to true power!
---
The Skill U pets?
---
I don't think they were ISDs, I mean they were happening every day all over nullsec. Like I said I don't know how CCP managed it. It felt almost like normal players just starting events on their own, the AI was that good.  Maybe whoever was managing this event system left or got fired because it really went to shit the last couple of years. 
---
Both the chat and the launcher have been a waste of dev time.
---
Olof
---
is it even to get refinery percentage of 100% to get 2 units out of each 1000 ore, or am I doomed to get 1 cuz low percentage?
---
People have been asking for those (and logi on KM I forgot that one) for what, three years? Four years now? And in that time they just couldn't squeeze in adding three variables to the killmails? It's a farce.
---
When i realised the lil drones that spawned counted to the kill numbers... one smartbomb later and i was laughing, had a lot of fun running those in null. Can't remember but there was another one that was just ez to run with a super that was kinda fun. 
---
Literally this made me quit the event, waste of dev time
---
And its not like they even add the sites them into the game in some form later. So waste of dev time imo
---
Want simple stuff with boosters and drugs dropping. All i did them for. At the very least let the agency point accelerators reward an actual accelerator instead of a slap in the face. And for the love of bob please rework the recipes to stuff that is not obscure. Like minerals/ice
---
killmails are OLLLLLD killmarks are super new in terms of comparison.
---
im more than 100% sure that binding the code between the killmarks on a skin, and the killmail generation, would be a hefty job.
---
i want to see it too dude, but id love to see capitals reworked before that if it speeds it up.the shame is CCP wont do anything drastic to capitals, like completely remove the jump drive from combat ships. that would be hilarious to be a part of
---
Person that know how to do it left CCP 10 years ago.          
---
Legacy code thing now. 
---
How is it not a bad idea for people who don't mine ? It makes the event even more worthless and more complete shit then it already is.
---
And when enough people completely stop running these things what will happen next ? They are going to make another "special" event to collect data to find out why people aren't running it like they did with Abyss ? And on top of that once they do collect the data its gonna tell them every fucking single same thing as you can find here and on the other forums.
---
Mining is the cornerstone of Eve's entire economic system.
---
What's your solution to replace the current most sophisticated virtual economic system?
---
\+1, as a player who has enjoyed the event sites thoroughly in the past - both as an income source and as a content source (low sec dweller), this new pattern that is emerging is a big letdown. I happened to notice the event on reddit and got excited! Thinking this would be the perfect time to resub since I've been busy with uni the last couple of months, I got a couple of ships ready and was all set for the 12th.
---
I ended up spending 30 minutes in a site in a t1 cruiser only to get one-shot by the BS rat -  fair enough it was a bug, but it made me look further into the event details and rewards, which completely turned me off from getting involved further.
---
Fast forward a couple of hours of roaming the amarr FW space, in the hopes of catching people farming skins, I have yet to see anyone actually running a site. And I get it! Why run the combat sites in lowsec, when the sites are mostly run in ships that are more expensive than most people like to fly with neutrals around? Earlier it was possible to get a decent amount of accelerators and skins for personal use directly in my home space, which felt good!  Now I have to mine too, just to build the items from blueprints?
---
I think that instead of moving a miner, a builder and an expensive combat ship to lowsec, I will just pretend the event never happened. RIP actual fun and accessible content.
---
Make it not boring and/or afk ?
---
first guess would be that this is intentional so extractor sales don't tank too much. ccp being that out of touch with their own gameplay is probably equally likely tho.
---
Oof 
---
Please suggest some mechanism that will do this, within a plausible development budget.
---
Where do i swipe my credit card?????
---
I don't say remove mining - simply stop forcing players to do it.         
---
There are people who are willing to do it or even like it.           
---
But currently in order to have slight chance to compete with multiboxing miners - you need to do the same yourself. 
---
Lies, this events makes you all moist. Dont deny it.
---
1 Garbage
---
What would you suggest as an alternative?
---
Like, everybody getting the equivalent of 5 Rorquals worth of minerals delivered daily, so they can participate in high-level stuff without grinding? Making Supers/Titans free? Removing the harsh death penalty and having ships live forever?
---
I'm not sure exactly how we play EVE without grinding for resources somehow.
---
CCP sees that everybody and their mother is mining so they introduce more mining into the former combat events.
---
they've had 15 years and plenty of captial to tweak their mechanism. they failed at nearly all new implementations
---
The sites are also rare as fuck. They don't seem to respawn.
---
I have not bothered with the last few events, I wanted to, but lack of sites, inability to take a low skill ship, and lack of worthwhile rewards for time spent had deterred me from this, I did participate in the rogue drone event, and found that a lot of fun, it's unfortunate that more events aren't like that one... 
---
Mining isn't forced at all. You can mine and sell to the market like any other miners. I don't recognise (given what you've said so far) why someone else mining more than you would effect you. What competition are you describing here
---
25000 mm is just 25 meters, right?
---
Still not a suggestion as to how to replace it. 
---
encouraging people to try a game style they don't normally play is never bad.
---
&gt; Some of them were even difficult and ships have been lost
---
well they sure were successful on that front this time around!
---
Ok so my ideas.             
---
1. If there is new event don't make mining required activity in order to complete it. Now you need to mine to have access to rewards and even most important rewards require a lot of mining.        
---
2. Stop nerfs to active ratting - why there is no constant waves of rats on minig belts that are adjusted to be more effective and killing your drones/fighters?            
---
Bounty to high? Balance it with reduced ISK payout and increased material value you get from sites.             
---
3. Relating to previous points - bring back drone minerals across whole new eden. Rorquals are already pumping a lot of minerals ... if not think about something else.               
---
4. Industry was killed by rorquals - people now building stuff from what they mined as in many cases it is the only way to sell "ore" at prices that are in acceptable levels.  I have no idea how to fix those 10 industry lines/rorqual char. But it is not about those players doing industry but about fact that they have ability to use so many lines - making interaction with other players undesired due to economical reasons.            
---
In old days - one guy mined, other hauled stuff to jita, this stuff was traded to a guy that again moved it with help of other players to local industy hub where he build the final product that was again moved back to jita and final destination.            
---
So we are talking like 6-7 layers of player interaction.          
---
Currently it is reduced to 2-3 ... basically the lower you can get the better chance **you can make some profits** - the "some" is most important part here.
---
Ja, why?
---
In EvE you compete with other players. 5 roqual chars make you 600mil/h you can get bit more if you build something from this ore.     
---
So if you don't mine - in order to compete with this players in terms of capability of what you can do ... you need to make similar amount of money.         
---
He can be utterly bad at PVP, but if he can replace 10 ships at the same time you can just one ... well he is going to win simply due to this fact. 
---
25m that a dread will have to shoot through when your super gets dropped
---
Posted in other place here.
---
Yes.
---
Gotta love the random materials you need, good luck to anyone living outside of jita.
---
Its not bugged, its a feature.
---
It's useless, so it's probably on CCP's to-do list, somewhere between Hello Kitty SKINs for caps and fixing local.
---
Yeah, but that doesn't mean anything. 
---
Oh wow omg not isk negative what will we do?
---
Price of garbage goes up therefore it's valuable - CCP Probly
---
I have never done events... but when people start complaining and asking for "just do the same stuff you did last year instead of adding new stuff" then there's something terribly wrong.
---
I think you are grossly simplifying.
---
1. Mining isn't the only source of isk. If you want to make is alone, then go trade on the market. That's just one alternative.
---
2. When you fight your opponent in a one on one fight, it doesn't matter if they can replace their ship ten times. They have to feck off back to station to get it. You won and can move on. I'm so confused as to why this is an issue.
---
I should thank Stargate for making me go and watch Farscape.  Otherwise the last few seasons of the OG series are a total bust.
---
Ha! I remember the second gala. I'd be cloaked in a buzzard flying slowly to get close to final spawn till it dies then I'd decloak, mwd to the spot, steal the loot and warp off.
---
i find it strange that you don't even have to be logged in... how can the chat issues affect me if i didn't even log in ?!?!
---
" Tldr- this event is not about the event itself, it is about the rollout of loot boxes. " given how completely SHIT the even this been so far this seems plausible.
---
The issue is obviously bigger than it is and won't fix itself easily, since it was designed to be "press 2 buttons every 10min and watch youtube" for years. There are no easy fix, it has to go with a rework. And any changes of that will go through a shit ton of angry people who want to be able to multibox 20 rorquals/barges as viable way to make isk.
---
IMO mining should be able to be played like exploration is, with active mini games. You would have to scan belts to know the somewhat general composition of the belt and then scan every rock to know what composition it is. Each rock being composed of several types of minerals, some worth shit, some average and some more or less valuable. You would have a somewhat 3d rock representation and depending on your scan you would physically select where to mine the rock. So that if you micro manage your mining you can quickly get to the very valuable veins on the rock and if you want to afk mine without bothering with the scanning/targeting you dig randomly in the rock. So that non-afk miners get mostly highly valuable ore and something not too boring, and you can still afk mine except it's worth less. The mining frigates would be more accurate but of course mining less and with less ore hold, while larger ship would be less accurate but able to dig mostly around the good part. With T2 ships being able to specialize in better scanning, more accurate mining.
---
Is that the rate of income of a rorqual: about 120million ISK/hour?
---
I think people fundamentally don't understand CCP's motivations. Their job is not that you have fun. Their job is to get you to spend money on the game and make it as big a part of your life and as important as they can. If you're spending $100/month for your accounts (or someone else is paying for them for you because you PLEX) and you're always on grinding and feel invested then that's a great result for CCP's bean counters. They don't care if you had fun.
---
If you bomb a frig with its MWD on chances are it will die to a single bomb.
---
its like the people that complain now never played any other game with launcher before 
---
which is probably the case
---
MasL does it all the time. To a great degree of success.
---
&gt; What happens next?
---
you shoot it again
---
&gt;How much time do I have until its repaired enough to go to RF mode again once I start shooting it?
---
hour or two
---
&gt;What are the best practices to take one down assuming it's RF timer happens to be pretty bad TZ...
---
1. keep rf'ing it, contact the owners and ask to buy it  
---
2. time rf'ing it so that it comes out on a weekend or day when you can alarm clock
---
a well-fitted large faction pos would easily run you that much
---
then again fittings are extra on top of that 600m too, so...
---
make it a minigame where you have to drill rock to find ore. boom, no more afk.
---
do you remember old school exploration? there was no minigame, just cycle your analyzer and wait (aka AFK) until the can opens. then CCP made it non-afk via a well received minigame.
---
it's not rocket science
---
This should be a thing, basically as OP said. Super easy to set off and super easy to cancel (just by pressing a button after you see the notification). Maybe add some cooldown that the structure can't be entosised again for X days to avoid spam (could be used as a hack to safety a structure from this if you're going on holiday, but then someone could just bash it normally).
---
just actually mining and selling the ore yourself is generally more profitable than mining missions
---
Wew
---
Frankly, you are just frustrated that you can't play Eve the way you want to play it. Wanting to increase economy sources is a misunderstanding of economy, and I think it's that obvious lack of knowledge as to why you're not getting much feedback.
---
you can buy plexes and get anything in the game
---
if I buy a tornado with plex and then use it to gank a random industrial, is that a loot box?
---
The event resumed.
---
I totally agree with you here.          
---
I didn't started to play eve to get engaged into it - yet this iteration of EVE is forcing me to do it.         
---
My assumption is that CCP goal is not make EVE only for 'economy' oriented players - but i could be wrong. 
---
Isn't it the case for like all CCP events ? 
---
That's not solving OP's problem. He is angry that ore isn't more valuable and can't earn enough isk because he thinks he needs 10 ships to compete against another person with 10 ships...
---
And there's a reason why bot mining hasn't been prevented. You talk as if CPP don't now how to deal with the and that in over ten years, nobody in CPP thought of a mini-game.
---
I agree with you.        
---
Before rorquals i was "engaged enough" to have multiple accounts.
---
Have you looked into other isk streams? Like science/trading/incursion?
---
You can't say on one hand that producing stuff from ore you mine is the only way to sell the ore at a reasonable price then on the other hand say if you only do Indy and buy ore you only make single digit profits. Doesn't add up. 
---
&gt;What more if you are not a PVP guy that needs isk to fund PVP but for example an industrialist ... you need to have those rorquals as getting minerals on the market already puts you in a very low 1digt margins on yours of your work.
---
This is not only rorquals but citadels as well. With the old outposts everyone who had a clone there clone there could inyeract with the market.
---
With citadels you can keep a market fairly isolated from out of alliance/blues interference.
---
But, tbh, i think this was intended by ccp in order to reduce reliance on jita, evem tho we still have jump freighters. 
---
Millions of tons of ore mined daily
---
I like them, they're like mardi gras skins!
---
Lmaooo noob I have a data scanner fitted on my hel (i called it hek hanhaha) and I do data sites. Very underrated and sometimes I do one of those sneaky secret research sites and they tru to blow me up and I was like BAHAHAHA TANK BITCH
---
YEah they use asic miners these days
---
You don't get it what is the issue, don't you.            
---
EVE **was** a pvp focused game, where you solved issues by using a lot of ammo.          
---
You spent most of your ingame time by shooting and flying around.      
---
Now you mostly spend this time in a system chained to a spot in a rorqual, usually multiple rorquals.          
---
When new player comes - he need to get asap into the rorqual mining in order to "catch up".             
---
He cannot compete with bigger older players without it.            
---
What more many changes are moving players into the mining as the only stable and good income source.             
---
Yep sadly this.  
---
Is that really a bad thing in this case?
---
Yep, also have fun competing without well rigged azbel or sotiyo.   
---
Well, I for one just ran some ded sites yesterday and loot fairy said YES!
---
stop posting
---
It's wonderful that this invention is all you have to cling to.
---
Selective quotation?
---
no because its not a box with loot in it.
---
It's based on veldspar so you could try that, there's hardly any ore at the site so T1's clear them out quickly.
---
Combat log doesn't tell you the damage types, only amount and weapon used.
---
They put a loot box in your loot box so you can get disappointed twice.
---
How?   
---
If i have 20bil in ore and i refine it i get like 21-23bil in minerals.           
---
(check it if you don't believe)         
---
If i put those 21-23bil into build i get stuff that i can sell for this mineral value - and by sell i mean in a week this is gone and it is not laying in hangar for next 6 months.            
---
You need to do this within range of single JF jump.  
---
Now on the other hand if i wish to "sell" the ore you need to :          
---
* spend time/isk on moving it to Jita         
---
* spend time/isk on selling it on market             
---
Basically you will get less than 20bil if you deduct stuff above.        
---
If you are indy guy - you also need to spend cash on market (i don't assume you do sell orders as you don't make any profit then) then cash on moving the stuff from and to market.      
---
Your profits are almost dead at this point.           
---
&gt;You are a T2 producer ? Well unless you can Rorqual mine those moons - even more work you need to put into activity are giving you same low 1digt profits ... quite often loses.
---
Yeah, you don't know anything about T2 production, at all. Spend some time in gs_isk; no one actually doing T2 production relies on mining their own moons so it's free. 
---
Wow a ticket AND a meta module? Im jealous now.
---
They need to cater to the new type of gamer - the gamer that wants his loot and wants it NOW. Pvp is dead. Long live pvp. 
---
What was in theAgency Support Drop boxes?
---
It's pretty clear by now that CCP is happy with the status quo. Do yourself a favor and unsub, go play something else or take up some other hobby. There's way too much out there to spend your days watching reruns on Netflix while you mine for a 3rd super alt that you'll use twice a year. 
---
I spent years using trading as my isk source and manufacturing as a secondary. I pvp'd as much as I liked. And new players can immediately start trading. Your imagination is the issue here. 
---
I never owned a rorq, never will. Never mined a pebble, still built ships and tech 2 parts and profited. So you can tell me all day that I don't know what I'm talking about but I had fun in Eve and I didn't have to mine. But from where I'm standing, Eve ain't the problem here.
---
At this point why are we surprised? The past three or four events have all been crap. 
---
See you in april/may 
---
Building 4 now, and 3 dreads for fun. 
---
how much for that serpentis plate
---
Thanks, but by this point I honestly don't know if I will try... I got a really bad taste in me over this event --"
---
Thanks anyway o/
---
I will let my Corp member know and try it.
---
:) https://my.mixtape.moe/malaty.mp3
---
How much isk are people selling this crates for in jita?
---
SG1 best!
---
But the real question is, what would a system lord do when he sees 200 feroxs lock his hatak?
---
Would about logi too? Stargate doesn't have anything like that so a fax would be insane at stopping a hatak from doing anything.
---
Take a look at the sizes of each as a start point I guess
---
How much would something like that weigh?
---
Not really, in this event the mining requirements are 10x more than they were before.
---
So you think 'oh, well that'll be good for new bros, they can make dank ISK mining and selling it on the market for other people', except they have to defend themselves the whole time mining, rather than the odd rat here and there.
---
Just marvelling at what something like that would weigh on a ship.
---
Oh don't worry, we have differentiated, disparaging remarks for each one of you.
---
I’m thinking about armour that is 25 meters thick, that hangs on a space ship and that has to be heavy as fuck.
---
/also pretty damn awesome too.
---
Yep, another event Ill be passing on, Risk v Reward = not worth the effort, time isk efficiency = not worth the effort, engaging PVE content = Id rather watch paint dry.   Major fail CCP
---
Well if everyone and their mothers are doing an event. Prices are bound to be shit.
---
There's a mass parameter in game you know.
---
How does it feel to be one bool away from your dream but never getting it?
---
I liked the event were I got a reward for logging in 
---
Like being in NC or PL and needing to call PH as you need capitals and supers. 
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
Unless you change the mass/size of the plates and see that it does not compute. 
---
Using the light skin my eyes are burning
---
Look how much space it takes. 
---
Every event after the first one has been dissapointing. Not even on the same level as the first, but progressively and steadily worse.
---
I mean my dread weighs 1.2 million tons unfitted.  A little more metal can't matter that much.
---
"Don't voice youe opinion because I don't like it"
---
An event doesn't imply low effort, easy reward at all! It's an event, something out of the norm.
---
Most people aren't really struggling for ISK, maybe it's just trying to make things a little different. I don't think that this one is per constellation, but I liked that aspect of the previous one. It's not a designation that gets used often and a lot of people ignore it, so it was fresh to see something on that level.
---
Take out you expectation that there should be an ISK reward and it's not as bad.
---
Not long ago people were clamoring for something a little harder, a little more focused on people with skills, time and resources do, rather than the boring tedium of easy shootings.
---
Each event is different and probably I'm enjoying seeing these new efforts come out of CCP.
---
There are going to be done worse than others, sure. Have a try, of you don't like it, don't do it. Doesn't have to include everyone, doesn't have to be rewarding. 
---
Ah I stand corrected then
---
Still need plates for your new toy?
---
Look at how good the f302s dealt with the death gliders. 302 seem to be pretty fucking similar to dragonfly fighters
---
Well yeah, these things are fit on capital sized ships. How much square meters is that times the mass of one of those plates? It has to be humongous.
---
this shitevent is only isksink, nothing more nothing less.
---
I don't mine Christ.........             
---
During the first Crimson Harvest, my relatively small wormhole Corp saw more content in less time than we'd ever seen otherwise. People were going crazy rolling holes, we had 1v1s or ganks that escalated several times a day, and we saw all different kinds of ships in sites ranging from fessors to gilas to faction battleships.
---
Every event since then has been worse than the last.
---
O'Neill also used the F302 to attack Anubis' vessel and cripple it without taking any damage while managing to out fly multiple death gliders.
---
Anubis comes to destroy earth... *Le wild cyno cruiser appears* NOPE, BAITED ON A FREE PLANET, gets dread bombed, GG. Don't forget to shit talk Anubis in Local.
---
CCP seems to always want to reinvent the wheel. It’s frustrating as hell. They finally discover the perfect round wheel in something like the rogue swarm event, and then they insist on making a new square wheel and trying to sell us on the new and exciting features it has.
---
Guys, you had something that worked well and was fun. Why did you have to ruin it by making it convoluted, inaccessible and unrewarding?
---
Oh look it's that video that must have been posted like 236 times, and that number is most likely close to the reality.
---
This is now my profile picture :-).
---
EVE is unbelievably beautiful.
---
\+1
---
only posted a million times... lets post again...
---
Give everyone 500k SP who was subbed a year ago. That will increase extractor demand to extract them.
---
Same here, no problems.
---
You wrong, what CCP really wants you to do is buy plexs with real money and sell them to make profit.  Keep doing that until something breaks in you and just become another bot user. 
---
I'm probably wrong, it does feel like that though
---
you mean boson 🤤
---
the leshak can output 3200 dps with overheat and drones
---
Stop posting this shit! Don't let posts around fucking lootboxes become a regular occurrence here. Do you want this bullshit mechanic to grow in strength in Eve too? Don't get people excited about a gambling mechanic. This should be frowned upon and resisted and not promoted and posts like that ARE promoting it.
---
Reminder: whs are collateral damage. 
---
Hahah, no matter how long you're gone from EVE, nothing ever changes :D
---
Less then 1.5M isk in drugs. 
---
Downvoted for talking shit about f1 frigates
---
I mean there are other ways to achieve this result using a spreadsheet
---
Honestly it's dumb enough I want to think its sarcasm, but then my brain rejects that as no one with any self awareness would be sarcastic in this way.
---
&gt; Is DDD short for doomsday device?
---
It has been for as long as I’ve been there?
---
Not necessarily it is 25m thick. In military vehicles nowadays the armors durability/stopping power is measured by EQUIVALENT of steel armor thickness. For example modern main battle tanks have a rather thin and lightweight composite eqiuvalent to 800-1100mm of steel.
---
Ohhhh boy, shit is build up to hit the fan at warp speed! xD
---
I wonder... What were that towers that have shown up around new Eden?
---
Also, can I ask to be marked when you post your next plot related lore dive? I'm looking forward for hearing about the drifters o/
---
Better get to work.
---
The permafrost(?) event was the first one I was actively playing for. I didn't even get the point of it. I just ended up minimising it and pretending it didn't exist. 
---
Tbh i stopped at one event that i had to do 5 jumps to find a single site ... it was "like my time is not worth it"        
---
Moment they included "mine da ore to do da accelerators" i stopped even using those i got from market - when they are at reasonable supply/price - they are already almost expiring. 
---
Well now you can also ... after 10 hours of mining, running sites and spending 1bil you can get stuff for like 1.2bil, if you manage to sell it .......         
---
oh i see what you did here    
---
You have no idea how moist i get when thinking about mining, hell i even dream about that stuff.
---
But he is saying how shitty it is...
---
I get the impression you are someone who cant read. How is any of what you said difficult to follow, nullsecers are legit bad at this game. 
---
After playing better events, I can't agree with you... They really droped the ball in this one if you ask me!
---
But hey, you do you pal... Fuck you too o7
---
This thread is literally the worst thing on the internet. 
---
Makes perfect sense. I had not hear that they did it like that, but it’s an easy way to visualise the information.
---
Thank you for that.
---
Build your Dreams.
---
Wreck their Dreams.
---
Because it is an interesting statistic.  Why not have it shown?
---
"You think you want lootable accelerators and a not-entirely-shit loot table but you don't"
---
&gt;ah, CCP is gone. They’re counting their money after cashing out. EVE is dieing.
---
I wouldn't say EVE is dying, but I would say you are correct about one thing. When CCP sold itself to Pearl Abyss, that was absolutely the cash out move. 
---
Unnecessary, comma.
---
Is that ZXB ? 
---
Remember when this sub actually contained cool stories and helpful comments? Now it's just an endless screed from anyone and everyone running into the smallest bump in the road and expecting someone else to solve their problem. 
---
You're bitching about ores and your spreadsheet? Really? Just stop sucking. There. That's your answer. That's the answer to 90% of the threads in this sub. Just STFU.
---
Shit. What if 2 of 4 characters are grr goon?
---
PVP is higher isk per hour than PVE, in other news water is wet. 
---
Nah. Just Oprah it. Every account gets a full set of tech 2 BPOs. And then watch the tears.

Event? You mean the rigged raffle?

What’s that thing flying in the back? Looks like a foreskin to me!

I miss that drone event.

You can't scream and kick your feet wanting nerfs to carrier and super ratting, then complain that generating isk ingame is hard.
---
Watch what you wish for, r/Eve, you might just get it.
---
a nyx only has 1 crew member

Some true things in there, but let's be honest: The biggest issue are the bugs. Wrong drop rates, wrong NPC stats and so on and so forth. This really hurts us all but the casual player the most. Just imagine a player who returned, doesn't really remembers how to do things and then tried the even yesterday and died to the battleship spawn. I'd guess he's likely to consider playing other games in his valuable spare time. Similar for the drop and spawn rates. In nearly all events the rates varied wildly because CCP didn't manage to put proper loot table into it. In the event before this the crazy dark blood faction drops in other events the drop rates suddenly fell and the accelerator prices spiked and a day later they were back to before again. People lost a lot of time for running the sites on that day (less importantly some lost isk in the market). Again, you can ask yourself if a player who experienced that is likely to keep playing this game. And this is surely the goal of the events. It's something with which CCP tries to keep player numbers high during the summer. No event in January when player numbers are high anyways. Now in February we have the first event again so that players are carried over into spring; then events and offers will follow so that people keep playing until next November/December. This is totally fine but the way the events are implemented in game I doubt they work as intended.
---
I never asked for those nerfs.      
---
tbh this is the first event I have problems finding sites in the first place.. not that I run around and all the sites are being already done... no.... there are simply almost no sites at all... like wtf... also I still dont understand why we have to manufacture the boosters ourself... stop trying to force mining into being fun its not happening
---
Fix your spreadsheet instead.
---
Install opensolver as last ditch effort.
---
OK then, I'm utterly bad at PVP **and** I don't have 5 rorquals.
---
I demand that CCP nerfs the PVP skill ceiling until every fight is a 50/50 coinflip regardless of skill! It's not fair that other players can beat me all the time!
---
I m looking for a battleship T1 that is able to tank fighter and kill them, under the neut pression of a carrier.
---
I tried a beautifull 100AB phantasm, but i get fucked because of the neut that shutted down my 2 invul and my prop. I prefer t1 because of the cost. Or peraps a cap booster in the phantasm fit? but i dont know because the fit was very hard with PG.

Enheduanni, I thought we stopped paying attention to them.   
---
Oh, wait, an ARC thread? Ok I'll actually read this.
---
I didn't know this was a bug. I like it though, it lets us bring stuka content to faraway places.
---
Wow pervert how could you facebook stalk me like this?!?!?!
---
Very comprehensive, I reckon it will be useful to newbies and not-so-newbies alike. Nice work. 
---
I’ve only done the last three events...sorta the Grand Prix one. I agree with your assessment.
---
I’ve noticed that they’ve gotten harder or take longer to get a reward. Crimson harvest was ok and frontline was interesting but overall, you needed higher skilled ships to do them. 
---
For instance, in frost line you could maybe do the mining but you aren’t going to do the hacking sites. I’m max skilled hacking and failed a lot. Not to mention you need a good tank for the rats. The mining require my fully fit skiff and medium drones. I don’t see how a new player did the combat site.
---
This one? You can’t mine without getting lucky finding a site that someone just did or you have an alt. The rats aren’t easy to do either.
---
What I do like about the events is the variety of getting loot. The “slot machine” is pretty cool but at 13 mil per pull, you have to be a vet to do it. The last two events had some nice things like it too.
---
The accelerators are nice but you are right, no low skill player will get access to them.
---
Overall though, we need to see what their goal here is. Is it to give new shiny loot to vet players to keep them playing, get the casual player to play longer, or give new content to new players? I don’t see how you can’t serve all three with this system.
---
To do this, I think CCP needs to scale the rewards and sites downward. Like the slot machine should have three tiers or something. Same with the implants, make them cheaper to build but lower the benefit some (+4?). Also, as much as they want to make this a grouping game, adding more difficulty isn’t going to force people to do them with others. 90% of pve is done solo. Maybe make abyssal type sites that are only accessible by a fleet? For mining, hacking, and combat - make sites scale for those activities so that a guy flying a venture can participate in the event with the guy in a maxed out skiff.
---
There is a lot of potential here with events and I think they are a fresh idea in an old game, but there is a lot more that could make them great.
---
I support this post.  And maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm not - but the bot miners are the main issue with resource production.  Its throwing off the curve of distributed wealth.  Esp. since botting is cheating. 
---
He should have been called Gary, not Terry. 
---
And that worked perfectly. Those drops sell for over 4M isk but when opened I got less then 1.5M worth of boosters from all 4 in total.
---
And each ore gives out a different mineral :o
---
And each ore has multiple variants :o
---
It's an interesting problem to solve isn't it? :D
---
Veldspar is tritanium only, move that out of the matrix and deduct it from tritanium needs on it's own island.
---
remember when supersuperbad lived up to his name and had no humor?
---
None of them are these days. 
---
FIGHT DA POWER
---
&gt; since there is no legitimate way to convert idk back into money
---
This is true of almost every in game currency in every game.  Go find any example of "gold store" currency in any MMO and tell me if it's possible to sell it back for cash.  Yet lootbox gambling is still a very big issue.  The difference here is that you're introducing extra steps to the same process to avoid bending gambling laws.
---
Bottom line: you can't tell me that the goal from CCP isn't too encourage you to buy Plex and replenish your in game income.
---
to be honest i dont think anyone thought about BPCs for accelerators. more like Gnosis/Sunesis BPCs or some little crap like that
---
Not even pepperidge farm remember that any more
---
I heard they are killing off rorqual mining with the Stain gate introduction patch.
---
I do...
---
25m (82 feet) of any metal, even cheapass steel is... a lot. Imagine that amount of plating surrounding most of the ship, the amount by volume is mindblowing
---
You're doing it wrong. 
---
I recall vaguely they’ve said that pulling that data out into a killmail is not a straightforward task, and would require adjusting the killmail format - which, despite the many things broken in EVE is one of the few things that seems to work decently
---
You lost everyone by making the 4chan meme visible and nothing else.
---
This does not compile 
---
I need an adult
---
This.
---
My usual MO with events is grind 1000 points for all the rewards, then fucking ignore it since everything else is garbage. The rewards worth getting are more easily obtained by farming isk the usual way and buying what I want. E.g. acellerators 
---
No wonder when I accidentally popped a cyno in that haven and a bunch of hostiles entered system they ignored me. 
---
Good
---
Mine in mining ships not boosting ships?
---
To be honest they are just working as their should be bringing small scale content to crab infested pockets. Nerfing null sec connections was an obvious mistake. Drifter holes just make up for it.
---
Fine... Let's take the Phoenix. Yes, I know, fitting a plate on a shield dread, but it's the closest thing we have to a semi-regular shape. The alternative is to approximate a Rev as an ellipsoid... Come to think of it, that might be easier...
---
The long axis of the Phoenix is 3756m in length and I would approximate the two short ones to about 1/3 and a 1/4 of that respectively. Basic math and we can calculate the surface area: A=2\*3756\*3756/4+2\*3756\*3756/3+2\*3756/3\*3756/4 = 2\*3756\^2\*(1/4+1/3+1/12) = 18,810,048 m². If we simply slap 25m thick steel plates to that they would have a volume of 470,251,200 m³. Missing here are the edges and corners. Let's fill those in as well, not that they really matter: V\_Edges = 25²/2\*3756\*(4+1+4/3) = 7,433,750 m³ and V\_Corners = 8\*25³/3 = 41,667 m³ for a total volume of 477,726,617 m³. Or about half a cubic kilometer. Yeah...
---
Anyway, steel has a density between 7,750 kg/m³ and 8,050 kg/m³. That would make that half cubic kilometer of armor weight about 3,821,812,936,000 kg for high density steel. According to wikipedia's Order of Magnitude chart for mass, that's about the mass of the world's entire food consumption for a year... or a tablespoon full of neutron star matter.
---
'Realistically', you probably wouldn't just enclose the entire dread in steel plates but only the important parts. Additionally, you might be able to use clever tricks to reduce the amount of actual material needed, but that's another topic and entirely up to speculation.
---
Very cool screenshot. Easy to forget just how huge keepstars are. Good perspective on how if KS were real their incredible mass would impact tides, etc
---
There's actually a calculation someone posted on this sub concerning energy usage by DDDs. IIRC the only definitive conclusion that was made is that depending on where you start counting numbers end up all over the place.
---
Would be hilarious if it did discriminate against Goons, stacking the rolls against them. :D
---
How much are the event logs on the market? I like collectibles like those
---
To issues with 1 patch. Nice!
---
This is really for noobies.  I mean vets shouldn't be doing it apart from having some content.  The events are pretty terrible but PvE in EVE is generally
---
Asps in front of things!!
---
Yup.
---
&gt;When a coordinating conjunction joins two words, phrases, or subordinate clauses, no comma should be placed before the conjunction. A coordinating conjunction joining three or more words, phrases, or subordinate clauses creates a series and requires commas between the elements.
---
Maybe it's 25000mm of equivalent steel plates. Like nuclear bombs are measured in their equivalent of tnt. Maybe the plating is just a few hyper dense centimeters thick 
---
don't have time for quality editing. if i need internet points i would go to r/funny or r/aww 
---
ALL I WANTED IS SKINS 
---
If the valkyrie pilots were actually connected to the server and controlled an actual players fighter, that would be so boring. You're flying around in heavy TiDi. The only time you kill things is when two neutral cruisers are in the system, but you likely wont kill anything as theres going to be at least three other supercarriers cynoed in to kill those 2 cruisers.
---
And then you're just going to be docked up most of the time.
---
but you need to be funny for r/funny
---
Why would anyone bother with the event if I can just take an 8mil sp toon in an astero and day trip to nullsec and come back with a billion + isk with very little risk or time investment for the reward.  
---
They have to figure out a way to make events appealing to the majority of the playerbase as well as newbros, maybe they should take a tiered approach with varying difficulties and have more lucrative rewards for completing the harder content with a lower sp requirement for entry.  In a game that’s been around for as long as Eve, you can’t expect everyone to want to do everything, but in the case of events they should try to be as inclusive as possible. 
---
You mean the Jove observatory s ?
---
Not disputing it in the least. From a nerd’s perspective I would like to see that properly documented.
---
And then have a learned conversation about it at Fanfest :-).
---
you can re-post random old crap and still getting hyped 
---
My point is , -i had a break and saw this new event feedback which triggered me. Not my first 0 score post and def not my last CCP throws shit like a madman
---
Tanking fighters? AND kill them?
---
hmmmm, i fly solo BS in low sec so i get dropped a lot by carriers and fighters are very powerfull against T1 BS. 
---
i tried active armor rep, buffer armor... you get killed pretty fast even with buffer
---
The only (simple) solution is to escape/avoid gate camp (but it's hard when you don't have scout).
---
yeah pls give us more stuff for gloating.
---
Welll. I asked them if i can do my internship there as game programmer, gamedeveloper etc. (i do believe i have fairly good understanding on games and cv) they just told me they are only working with local universites that they have agreement. Sooo looks like its better for them to hire totaly random person over someone who has passion to work on their game.
---
"*Hehe you* ***quoted my posts within the same thread*** *to disprove my own claims, and you called me out for stalking peoples post history for* ***posts completely unrelated to the topic containing opinions that I don't like that I have a compulsive need to thought police both for karma and upholding the ideological narratives I cling to****, and since these two things are obviously* ***the exact same thing****, you're a hypocrite!"*
---
This kind of shit might work within your own narrow and insular social groups/forums, but for the love of god stop picking fights if you're going to be this fucking terrible at it.
---
You have just made a sophisticated numbers-based argument for why actual metal armour, in the quantity and properties presented, would be a tad on the heavy side on any space ship. You made a nerd’s argument to a nerd about a gaming environment that is to nerds what a night light is to a moth.
---
I love you with all my heart [I am not being the least bit sarcastic].
---
Fly safe, my wonderful, talented, adorable space nerd :-).
---
This, plus devs are probably testing stuff. 
---
I think that events having their own sites is the problem. 
---
Look at the tickets we have. Imagine just getting that randomly for doing what we were doing anyway? From rat loot, from asteroids popping, from explo cans, etc.
---
This was a serious post? I got the impression that this was a somewhat tongue in cheek jab at those of us who like optimizing things to mathematical perfection.
---
I don't even get who the target audience is for this event. I'm pretty sure the sites are far too difficult for even first year players (especially requiring both military and industry) but the rewards are scaled for like day 1 players with a pay/material structure that's probably far beyond a new players capabilities. 
---
Imagine if they were "spies/infiltrators" and start shooting your other fighters amidst a fleet fight.
---
Or start shooting you while ratting xD
---
This....would actually be fun.  
---
Someone influential in the design of all those events (incl the xmas one) has the key word “loot boxes” stuck in their head
---
i think you misunderstand OP's issue...
---
It is almost like CCP intended to do that with both games (and with the already failed Proyect Nova) but failed miserably because (who would have imagined) that kind of interaction actually made both games more boring and was almost impossible to implement decently.
---
So, you are basically making a really short version of what CCP has intended to do already and failed for a longer and more detailed list of reasons than I care to explain here... you seriously thought this was an original idea?
---
Working as intended
---
Its too early for quick maths
---
If I lose my ship, why should I want to give you more enjoyment?
---
I was agreeing with you until you said capital balance. I don't think that is a priority.
---
Wow, you've been doing better than me if you can make 20% profit running this event... I'm currently isk negative, even if I can sell what dropped fo from the loot crates I opened...
---
Looks like Pearl Abyss already infiltrated the design team.   Very PA to put a low price/time tag on player actions (seeing our time as worthless means high grind).
---
The new type of gamer won't play eve, its not a br and has a insane learning curve
---
So no, they don't need to cater to those guys. They need to cater to the niche market they are.
---
Proof: a decade of falling player numbers.
---
Do you never do PvP?  Cause you would see others as well when you get a kill.  And if you dont you will have zero killmarks so they wont have anymore enjoyment anyways.  
---
I imagine a Statergy like C&amp;C could work. Just add 2 gamemodes to the game, one in which you play separated from eve online (so you can play whenever you want) and one where you play during planetary timers when one eve-faction conquers space of another. 
---
Would also result in interesting tradeoffs. Do you take some ppl to defend the planet or use them in eve as pilots to defend other planets or counterattack? Or maybe you sign up as mercenary from one eve faction and attack/defend. The payment in ISK would go to your eve account/faction. Something like that. Could open another pillar to the economy. 
---
The Planets could give some additional benefits in ressources or negative effects for the attacking space force, so they cannot simply ignore the occupation. Something like orbital cannons, shields projected from the planet to defending ships in orbit, etc. . Attacker could use ship-mounted orbital cannons (the ones used for dust514 bombardment) during attack do temorarily disable Ground Structures to fight these effects.
---
Just also add an auto-complete mode (which is slower than really playing the match) so if the Strategy game dies, no system in eve is too negatively affected.
---
You should pose your problem statement better.  There is a fallacious approach to your problem.  Also, strictly speaking, since there are integers in play, the problem you are posing is a discrete math problem, which means that your output vectors may not exist given an input vector.  for instance, if you tried to get an output of exactly 4 tritanium and 1,000,000 megacyte, with all other minerals zero, there is no input vector that will generate that output vector.  You are thinking about the problem as a continuous problem, not a discrete problem.  
---
I mean, this response and the next few is literally just a frothing asshole level of response.
---
Doesn't matter, he's giving this shit exposure. That's enough to reel certain people in to try it.
---
How are game news advertisements 
---
Something something OCD kicking in, please spend programming hours to help me so I don't need to take my meds.
---
/r/wooosh
---
I mean the first few were basically all pretty even
---
But yeah it started going down quick
---
With chemical / high energy reactions in warheads / ammunition, the amount of energy required to launch a volley in no way equals the amount of energy of the actual collision with something.  This should only be relatively equal in terms of energy weapons, since the energy is the weapon.
---
We can also assume there's plenty of alternate capacitors built into a DDD system where the amount of energy drained off the primary capacitor of the ship itself is only part of the actual energy discharge.  This, of course, is theory as these things aren't real and no one knows exactly how it would correlate in the *shudder* real world.
---
Do you have data to show the percentages that enjoy mining vs. those that do not? This seems a little bit like a whine rather than a constructive item.
---
Yes! Those things! xD
---
Flew through highsec, 2-3 sites in almost every system
---
I guess I am missing your point here... "in order to compete with others you need to have bunch of alts in rorquals mining while you do other stuff."
---
Compete as in PVP ships and skills etc?
---
I think for those who love /to play the game/ as they want, when they want, etc... would disagree with your simplified summation.
---
I have been playing since 2012 and still love playing the game the way I want.
---
I have never felt like I have been "forced" to do anything I didn't want to do.
---
The first one had it all. High reward, easy access, and the risk involved where people constantly stole sites, went suspect, and caused quick bouts of PVP. Even made for great bait to kill those that went to steal.
---
Every time EVE has an update I've just gotten less motivated the last year. Dumb shit.
---
Well from what I know they where just watching every one and collecting information them to what end I don't know but the drifters whated the information bad enough to cut them open
---
I will point out that there are some days a belt sees no activity and other days where rats warp in every 5 minutes. I mined for an hour and a half last week and had 12 waves, including two dreads, show up in 90 minutes. It was rather intense.
---
She says 1v1 at the sun, then disappears and launches a gate into the sun to make it go boom....cheater
---
All of these sound super cool as a shower thought, but as soon as you start thinking about the actual implementation, you'll start to realize how dumb it is. Supers spend most of their time logged off or in Havens. Would you buy a game which you can only play randomly in the middle of the night when someone decides to log in a super and warp it to a Haven? Fights where supers get used are extremely rare. Also, Dust is very much a different game than CS:GO. It'd probably compete with Battlefield instead, but I don't think CCP would be able to match the EA marketing budget.
---
Still put in time so not completely free.
---
So can we sue CONCORD for false advertising? I bought 25000mm STEEL PLATES not 25000mm steel EQUIVALENT!
---
peraps this with the large cap battery, i will give it a try, need a 1 implant PG 1%
---
Phantasm
---
Republic Fleet Large Shield Extender
---
Large Compact Pb-Acid Cap Battery
---
Focused Medium Beam Laser II, Aurora M
---
It's a poor state of affairs when I'm unsure which of these is higher on the list
---
Right, but the first one was rogue drones, the second was blood raiders, and the third was serpentis. No mining, no tickets, no BPCs, just accelerators.
---
ccp - trolling players since 2003
---
Can we at least knock the VNI down to 100mbit?
---
Can't argue with that logic...
---
Except you don't have to eat said shit.
---
And not everyone feels the same way about said shit as you do.
---
And most people aren't even aware the shit is there, ergo they aren't really eating shit, if they just click straight in to the game and ignore it.
---
Sound logic.  Or scat fetish.  No judgments here, pal.  It is a Safe Space.
---
Though I agree CCP doesn't exactly succeed at getting the right reward/risk balance they hold so dear, I think it doesn't deserve all that pitchfork-lifting. Remember that last Christmas, a good part of the player community ranted about the exact opposite reason: CCP gave us to much for no effort. Sure, things could be done better but we shouldn't forget how hard it is to satisfy so much people with so different expectations in only one feature release. As long as there will be such tantrums among us, the devs will panic and try even the stupidest things, hoping for the best. Let's just provide them with calm objective feedback and fair criticism. 
---
It would, wouldn't it. And then why not raise up the ante? You successfully kill the dev you get invited to the fanfeset all expanses paid.
---
I know it might sound silly, but I think that one of the things that makes Eve stand out the most compared to any other games is the intricacy it maintains with the real world. Instead of capitalizing on trying to find news ways to make old mechanics work, CCP should try to incorporate more and more AR themed events.
---
Is ~~CCP~~ Pearl Games going to rehire the quality control/outreach folks that got canned to make the company more appetizing during the bidding/buy out process, or are they gone forever?
---
Expected a message about ownage and declaration about sexuality. This is still good too.
---
In all seriousness I’d just accept the excess and ceiling whatever solution I get, for when complete consumption is not possible. I wanted to minimize this excess. I could probably rref or brute force it or something it’s just something I have to do later. Adding an eighth mineral was a pretty obvious joke I thought.
---
You could've said it more nicely but I agree. People seem to underestimate the time needed to fully design a new set of icons, never mind the actual creative process. There are definitely more pressing matters 
---
Arty is typically used with short range ammo. With short range ammo, the weapon has worse tracking and extremely high alpha compared to rails.
---
When using mid range ammo, the arty has better tracking due to the +25% tracking bonus on the ammo. It still has higher alpha, but not by much, and lower DPS.
---
DDs are able to crack planets, even frigates have nuclear level weapons. I saw a calculation on The nalgafar saying a single salvo puts out hundreds if not thousands of gigatons worth of damage.
---
There is no need to show off your lack of knowledge about linear algebra.
---
If you want a Stargate themed flair, I got you. Just reply to this comment with whatever text you want and I'll see if I can get us a Teal'c flair logo ;)

Last time I made EVE my desktop background I kept trying to rotate the picture thinking I was in game.

So you think you should have everything you want? Other people involved should have no say.

Anubis Flagship (1st) -&gt; Dreadnought? (in atmosphere and with degreaded shields/core systems ... thats why it got destroyed)
---
Anubis Flagship (2nd) -&gt; Battleship
---
Wrath Cruiser -&gt; Battleship
---
Wrath Hive -&gt; Titan/Super?
---
Ori Mothership -&gt; Marauder
---
it would take a few ha'tak to take out one capital
---
the ships even arent that big...just look at the ship comparison chart
---
in the supergate battle the ori ship one shot all ha'tak and would place ori ships in marauder class
---
death glider are pretty weak. in atmosphere shields not working and getting shot down by stingers and at4
---
the x302 was designed as a anti ha'tak ship but degreaded with the F302 to a SS fighter later on and also never in a battle 
---
the x303 had pretty good shields even in atmosphere and could easily take a few hits but weapons were almost useless against bigger ships like ha'tak
---
in the anubis earth attack it got hit a few times but goa'uld are like the stormtroopers of stargate 
---
in the end shields were down and got almost destroyed
---
the x304 was the best anti goa'uld ship at could easily take out a few ha'tak (at least the old ones)
---
a x304 with zpm and asgard weapons were little dreadnoughts
---
The proudest moment in my life was this:

I fucking love Farscape.
---
Hello friend. Looks like you are in desperate need of some.... *mod bias*.
---
Well, I imagine despite their large volume, they’re mostly hollow, so their mass isn’t quite so large as to influence tides, imo
---
I think with how many people got blapped by the event in the first hours, the whole playerbase might go overall isk negative on this event.
---
Thank god
---
Maybe im the only one who wants to go there so nobody else has noticed there is still no ticket sale ...
---
That's no moon...
---
Give me all your stuff pls, nothing would change for you its just data after all
---
It's a bold move by CCP to put loot boxes in a game played predominantly by people who know how to do math.
---
Yes, obviously that's what was stated or inferred in my previous response. /s
---
Quite a bit, in fact thats pretty much all I do, which is also why I'm aware of the incredible damage free intel does to the game.
---
The idea that undeserving autists scouring zkb for intel getting even more enjoyment when they see 20+ kills is undesireable.
---
How long did it take you to do a couple of sites? Because 100m sounds like shit. 
---
We need someone to do the math on this.
---
Still caring about killmarks in 2019.

And it's actually waaaaay easier to RMT now that Alphas and skill injectors are a thing.

Okay.

smoothbrain
---
Awesome article, thank you Stitch!
---
More Ugly Skins!
---
fixed it for you
---
Ha! Yes, I can totally see myself doing that at some point :-).
---
But then: they are advanced space ships that have multiple c warp capability. If you have access to that kind of energy, pumping out damage should never be a problem.
---
/which is why, if the aliens find us first, we’re going to be in a shit ton of trouble, because the guys with the greater availability of energy will win. People with superior fire power are rarely polite.
---
Can they reimburse the hours ive spent trying to find gala sites?
---
also a smoothbrain
---
it's cool that they some flavour text instead of "we gave you your ship back because we fat fingered the DPS value"
---
"We HOPE to get shot back."
---
^ fixed
---
Very good point. I would also shudder at anyone actually having that much fire power available to them.
---
I see a lot of screen shots of software interfaces. I have been known to click on control features only to realise, yah, not going to happen.
---
Well yeah... What else have you done? Oh yeah, nothing. 
---
&gt; There are definitely more pressing matters
---
Like any positive change instead of a lateral change.  You do this and you'll just have a different set of people complaining that the game looks like candyland instead of a dark, gritty space game.
---
Honestly, I'm fine with either.
---
Uniform activity = so many dudes cloaky camping relic sites.
---
bought all of needed materials for 1/3 price of jita fuckery, good luck to anyone being in jita
---
Woooosh
---
Time to lose it again now!
---
I play eve for the grind.  It is an enjoyable activity for me and others.  Not for everybody, but then again I can't stand FPS or Battle royale games.  I'm not looking for instant gratification.  If I was, i'd probably not play eve.  If eve was to remove the grind, i'd probably lose interest.

its related to money, probably has higher priority. like skins

Pathfinders is recruiting

---
Why even bother censoring
---
Used to get more fights from stealing before also as more desirable/expensive stuff was in the can.
---
Now it’s seems it’s the same old gambling loot crate idea that most other games have.  And who’s going to risk shooting you over a ticket..
---
i wouldnt know, i've never lost a ship before (wormholer btw)
---
You don't have half the settings turned on.
---
it weighs nothing in space!
---
That seems to be the theme now. You have to invest an insane amount of time into something you wouldn't normally spend ANY time on for something that is mediocre even in the best of times. The mining alone is enough to make me log off. The ore is crap, the payout is crap, why should any of us ever do this when I can spend 2 hours in null sec and make 300m?
---
Uh... aren't they supposed to do that?
---
My favorite event so far was the last years crimson harvest. The new graphics, good loot, somewhat challenging but not overall difficult gameplay just sold it for me.
---
I don't need no lottery or agency. I want to shoot spaceships and get something from their wreck in return. Boosters are ok, but I don't want to mine for them if it's not my playstyle. Again the two different sites (one for mining and one for pure PVE) from the CH 2018 were perfect.
---
If CCP would take the Crimson Harvest as template and change the background nebula, structures, faction loot table and maybe the asteroid colors, for the corresponding event faction everything would be fine. 
---
If they are brave enough they could add new dangers / mechanics to the already existing templates every year to make the experience more complex over time... why do they try to implement all new events everytime... it doesn't make sense.
---
If they want to prevent botting, why don't they just implement a hacking minigame like the ones from the datasites for the acceleration gates to go through. Doable without any analyzer and not very difficult, just to prevent the autonomous farming of those sites.
---
"I dont like mining so CCP should make it more tedious for those who do"
---
No, get out.
---
The irony of virtual loot boxes.
---
thanks I really wanted to spit coffee all over my keyboard anyways 
---
To bad, been looking for an excuse to come back over the past year, was really looking forward to the frostline event or this one but I guess there hasn't been any point to coming back for those 
---
Even worse... at least I can still play when and how I want and have no interest in finding loopholes to "play to win"... ugh!
---
is there any actual fanfest this year? 
---
I think that would require the ore to actually make them money. If it doesn't make money, no one is interested.
---
Inspired by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ao4zft/not_the_launcher/) post I tried to imagine what CCPlease could/would look like if they were diving into issues that directly effect everyday players of the game.
---
This post needs a PSA tag. THE PEOPLE NEED TO BE INFORMED!
---
We have an in-game stat for the mass of a KS...
---
Looks like low graphics setting.
---
If weightless conditions apply: YES! So true.
---
But it’s still going to have mass. You have to start and stop that amount of material and I’m thinking: that’s not going to be an easy thing.
---
Lol. Ban hammer incoming for sharing gm communication? :)
---
There is a rumor going around that they had a mutiny and their leadership changed.
---
&gt;  (wormholer btw)
---
Thanks, we were all wondering.
---
https://imgur.com/a/4spZqP6 
---
sharing the ingame message is not GM communications, though.
---
Although i'm surprised the logs showed that anything was amiss here.
---
Noone wants to have to mine for days to build a blueprint for an accelerator.  I did the survey and they don't get granular with the questions.  I would literally unsub before running the new style of site CCP has created especially with the new and beautiful having-to-mine-to-make-accelerators.
---
Or stop mining and play the game for fun
---
Don't forget -- that's 1 Basic Cerebral Accelerator that will disappear in about 6 weeks.
---
Why? All they need to do is have a 0.000000001% chance of a decent module dropping and the gambling addicts will throw money at them. It works for a vast majority of games that contain lootboxes, why wouldn't it work here? People are just as stupid.
---
Isn't it?
---
These loot boxes _wishes_ they were Activitions or EAs...
---
Don't forget there are 3 versions of each ore too, so yeah your spreadsheet is fucked now.
---
Whilst this is a joke, it is easily completed by a simplex solver in excel.
---
Did they end up still screwing you over with the dropped items or give it back 100%?
---
It's not against the terms of service any more, so share away.
---
I only have the +5% versions where I live so I just adjusted for that.
---
No, CCP won't dupe items for you. 
---
Your spreadsheet-fu needs improvement, young grasshopper. 
---
They also don't seem to test anything new before they throw it on TQ.
---
if this is the case then CCP and PA best realise that there are now some very serious legal stipulations on loot boxes in certain countries and ignoring those can put them in some seriously expensive legal hot water.
---
Well..  Cool :-D. "Path of OriiGen" is my alliance name.  But I leave that to you if you think its alright :-)
---
I don't think the "Loot box" model will ever be implemented in Eve... not over the kindness of their hearts, or the love they have for the community, but rather over the fact that government is openly targeting this system, and cracking down on it pretty hard, with some countries out right banishing and forbidding it implementation... Also, PR nightmare. lol
---
i try to rotate eve videos on youtube when i've fullscreen'd them. or sometimes check the range of people's modules.  
---
also tried to control-space my browser last week when i clicked on an incorrect link &gt;.&gt;
---
&gt;Put CCP on a stream out solo roaming
---
Pls, carrier application would be nerfed within the week.
---
Thanks for contributing to my pool of trivial knowledge. Take my upvote!
---
I took a quick look at Zkill to see what the new NPC was killing as far as player ships and quickly decided the risk versus reward ratio wasn't worth it. I'll just roam around  looking for abandoned drones, MTU's and player wrecks. The last few events have either been excellent  or complete garbage. The Christmas event being garbage and crimson harvest event being spot on. To be honest I've gone from a couple hours play per day to less than an hour per week lately and my omega is good until next winter. The good events are a bright spot in the routine play. A poor event is not worth me logging in though. 
---
Sounds like you forgot to extract biology first.
---
same lol
---
Does this mean they're working on fixing the dps?  And maybe the loot?
---
You will need at least 15 units of garbage for manufacturing. You can find it in those gambling loot boxes, good luck
---
you mean... like in their eye holes?
---
And 3100 units of Shartsponge Ore, event sites only.
---
&gt; enough to reel the retards in...
---
 Fixed.
---
I'm all for the exposure, since the FTC is already looking into a few games for this type of BS.
---
ooo i like that
---
Yeah how dare he make a post about something other than the shitty gala event.
---
is that the new model for the Wasp?
---
I will keep my reply civil.  Can we get clarification on what you expect of us (in how to run the sites?).  I have spent 200M on tickets using minerals from last event, and have got nothing beyond a booster at best valued at 2M each.  Thankfully I had the minerals, as the amount of mining required in this iteration makes turning in tickets unrealistic, let alone mining to create boosters using BPCs that don't appear to drop.  I thought you guys did great things on the objectives this event (Including the timer for ones people wont run) but it is always 1 step forwards and 2 steps back.  It is like you want this event to drain the Chromodynamic that is already present in game, let alone the ISK drain for some 'horrible' RNG.
---
They can go in two directions with these things. Either make the sites be like the Blood Raider event, decent rewards, not hard to run and encourages PVP. Drop the Agency stuff
---
Or, keep the agency stuff, make them limited time 'bonuses' to stuff we already do, and drop the sites.
---
Either option would be better than this weird lootbox frankenstein thing.
---
Your problem statement seems wrong. You likely want Ax&gt;b with a side-condition of minimizing the total mined ore ||x||. Sounds like a typical convex optimization problem.
---
Also the jove pulled out right before the drifters appeared. My guess is there's a huge jove/drifter conflict we don't know about yet
---
I think a PLEX reward would be more likely, actual expenses are not something CCP is going to want to do, especially if there are like 200 people on the killmail.
---
I so just started watching sg-1 for the first time. We are all f****** Go' uld.
---
This. Drone and Harvest events were great for wormholes, lowsec, and some parts of null for content.
---
Until you look at the ships in 4k, and realize they are still using HD textures....
---
logi get a whore-on ability, activated like the button the t3d gets to change modes?  
---
...nah that's dumb. But i agREE, logi should get on killmails.
---
Terrible.
---
To be fair, the EVE community complained about those, which probably spurred the changes.  
---
"Why are the rewards the same whether we're in null/low/high/wormholes?!"  
---
Now, compared to the new events, the old ones seem perfect.
---
"I'm unable to restore your ship, since you deleted your character. Let me know, if I should reinstate your character again please"
---
was the nice second email i got, after the first one that told me they was giving back my gila, scared the shit out of me so i had to login and see if my toon was gone
---
I mean you're not wrong but, if you're gonna jerk off about something you might as well play with your nipples while you're at it.
---
I agree.  The new sites are not new player friendly and the rewards are overly complicated and generally meh.  Corpmates and I spent an hour running 4 VIP sites in 3 carriers with a barge to mine. Net was 100 mil shared between the three of us.  Not worth the risk in low sec. 
---
The "[Inheritance](https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/inheritance/)" chronicle is a fantastic read and goes into everything behind Caroline's Star and the Directorate - I'd definitely recommend reading it, or listening to Zendane's [EVE Reader](https://evereader.phoibe.org/?p=414) version :)
---
Report it then, show examples, send messages to politicians, DON'T do it here.
---
Why would you want to minimize excess?  You are costing yourself ISK in the process of doing that--it is almost always more profitable to mine the highest valued ore, sell what you don't need and buy what you do need.
---
Nope the Jove left before Catalin star went super nova. Not said where to but the packed up a took off in there mother ships months before the star anom even  more then the drifters showing up
---
It kind of looks like someone took a venture, removed the front booms and put in 3D axis machine gun turrets. They look abnormally large, but i can dig it. Probably an angel fighter i guess?
---
Could be very dumb. Possibly the most dumbest idea ever. The only people that would ever get this is goons. Then they would proceed to wipe the floor with everyone. The no one would undock.
---
Do you want no one to undock? Cause thats how you get no one to undock!

Letting you know that upvoting is the same as +1

---
The majority but there were still jove who interacted with the empires. That all stopped right before the sleepers right? Like now theres 0 jove agents operating where there was a few dozen before? I could be mistaken but I know Grious said something like that in Theosophy or w/e that cronicle was called
---
More space for chat windows.
---
I don't need to, they read everything we type, these days. ;)
---
I'm actually not sure what you're so outraged about. Yeah, the gambling thing is potentially bad but it mainly catches retards who would find a way to get into trouble anyway. The non-retards who lost to this mechanic will walk away, their curiosity slaked.
---
Screeching about it seems a bit over the top.
---
RABBLERABBLE
---
Try posting this on the Eve Facebook group
---
Mittens already has his polarized Aug navy. I don't think he needs this but you will surely get a bonus for publicly suggesting it for him :)
---
no.
---
The way I see it is that Goons would start bashing structures, then hit timers. This forces people to figure out how and where they want to fight.
---
Maybe make it so that it can't take cynos either, and has to gate. Maybe make it have a stupidly slow warp speed. That way everyone always knows where it is.
---
It would at least force something to happen.
---
Thats one way to push login numbers
---
It s really better with 2 account :
---
You can multibox  subcap, or multibox a subcap and have a cap in standing waiting to cyno if needed. If you have a super or titan, it s 999999x better to have your own FAX always on standby for it.
---
With 1, it s better to stick with subcap.
---
im buying ore
---
Hmm if it can't dock anywhere, can't recieve remote reps, then a big enough dread bomb should kill it no? Except you might have to titan bomb it if you want the 1t isk killmail
---
know that feel
---
The biggest, largest dread and titan bomb ever. And maybe fully-erect Dreks and whatever those precursor logi ships are.
---
It would honestly probably crash the server.
---
In the shape of a vagina! A ship so big that it uses other ships as ammo
---
Uh, You realise that they are working as intended ?
---
There is currently a load of shit going on in the lore that strongly implies this is an intentional event by CCP that is leading up to something...
---
ships in HD still look sub-par if you zoom in on them tbh.
---
The CCPlease we want, but not the one we deserve.
---
First event with mining where you had to mine and refine ore into Chromodynamic Tricarboxyls wasn't that bad actually. It was a nice change of activity for once and gave more profits to new players.  
---
Current one though looks like a total waste of time.
---
I wrote software that calculates the minimum price in Jita that also minimizes overflow.  I used the Microsoft Solver Foundation for .NET/C#.
---
For you to do it on a spreadsheet I'd recommend using OpenSolver.  You'll want to get the pricing from ESI, there's a few ways to do that using Google Sheets so look those up and retrieve the relevant information, then plug the info in to OpenSolver and have fields to indicate what your desired output(s) is/are.  If you have experience with combinatorics or linear algebra, or a degree in Math or Statistics, it should be usable for your purposes.
---
\&gt; Edit: Downvoted by salty init lads that I'm making the wormholes they're exploiting known, SAD. Low power.   
---
No, you are being down-voted because you have completely failed to grasp the situation in that the wormholes are NOT Broken, And that CCP has intentionally done this for Lore reasons.
---
It was promised by CCP over a year ago. So check back in 2023
---
I don't know how you can say that it's terrible to have stuff " that is meant to be recognisable at a glance be monochrome."  That's fabulous design to support play for people who are color blind and doesn't affect anyone else at all while still keeping the section of the ui from being distracting.  The real issue is that the design of a number of the icons are very similar and this attempt at providing an accessible ui is mostly a failure.
---
It was the same in Eve 2018. I've never "had fun" mining long before rorqs left their POS. Still ambivalent.
---
Thank you for bringing the real on this. 
---
Someone came in to chat bragging 1B isk in under 5 days, so, yeah.
---
The first one was pre injectors. Everybody became addicted to the boosters in an instant. It was basically a drug war! Good fun!
---
Assuming A has linearly independent rows (and I think it does, based on my understanding of your explanation?), you could use the [Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%E2%80%93Penrose_inverse#Definition): pre-multiply both sides of your equation by the transpose of your matrix A^T, so you now have
---
 A^T A **x** = A^T **b**
---
then the LHS has a square matrix. Now you can invert and calculate
---
 **x** = (A^T A)^{-1} A^T **b**
---
Events are a load of fucking wank and always have been.
---
Don’t talk about your posting that way
---
Send me picture and text on discord and I'll add it
---
Why would you build this instead of 1680 titans?
---
&gt;there are no more "ads" now

I think this is what they're talking about [https://imgur.com/a/PXAilmJ](https://imgur.com/a/PXAilmJ)  
---
Now here's something kinda bad: When taking that screenshot i heard my fan spinning up, and found that the launcher briefly pings my CPU for 18-28% usage every ten seconds. And I have a pretty beefy CPU.  
---
Mind you, it's only \~4% when not fully engorged like that. And there is no reason to ever stretch it that much.
---
A few stayed behind *to keep the lights on*, However over time they each died 1 by 1 from the jovian disease or they too left the cluster, Veniel was the last remaining jovian and had been interacting with people all the way up until recently in the Inheritance chronicle, When  he handed over the CONCORD authorisations for the Jovian Empire to Matshi Raish of SOCT (The group who had worked closest with the Jove for all the years)
---
I don't quite remember if he left the cluster or died, But as of now, There are no known jovians left in New Eden, The closest we have is as mentioned in the OP, Drifters and Triglavians.
---
Killstreaks aren’t that interesting considering that pilots rack them up in fleets all the time. If you ended my 20 kill streak, that may sound really impressive until you find out I just happened to brawl against another fleet and tagged 20 ships that blew up in the fight.
---
Hahaha, man they fired most of the devs that literally made eve what it was. This is just wishful thinking 
---
I'm not sure if building this would necessarily have any strategic gain. It's more like something you would do to make "Eve history".
---
On the other hand, it would create a large amount of conflict.
---
Right and I'm entirely speculating but didn't the "last Jovian leaving new Eden" more or less correlate with the drifters showing up? Like CCP went from Jovian storyline to Drifter storyline? Idk just speculating
---
You're not gonna find any subcap in the game that can straight-up perma tank a carrier. It's 2,500 DPS, even with no neut pressure at all. Only ceptors and possibly some AFs can speed tank enough to survive indefinitely. 
---
So, much like the Palatine, it wouldn't be built.
---
[Behold](https://i.imgur.com/FFZLfta.png)

Also we should be able to see mutplasmid attributes in the killmail

Get your 200M ISK ship back.

1B in mods? meh...

So we know how much blue killmarks Rimilsa or Cormak's Titan had when it dies kek

&gt;Modifying the EVE Online client or using third party software to connect to EVE Online is not permitted and violates the EULA.

So basically you never get more than 3-5 killmarks per ship and dint want to be embarrassed?

I hope so.

When I started playing a few years ago, I was in a small newb corp, we were all poor and didnt know what we were doing. Blind leading the blind kinda thing. A war deccing corp declared war on us and demanded like 1billion isk or something to drop it. All we could do was find new corps and not goto trade hubs because all our assets combined didn't make that. 
---
This was the second time for this to happen in the few weeks I played. I got lucky and got into a good corp after that, but this game was about on its last chance with me. 
---
Shots fired.
---
&gt;launch directly into a specific player
---
now we're talkin'
---
Only CCP is going to know that for the time being, I assume before they made the change they decided on some key performance indicators and wrote scripts to report on them week by week.
---
Sadly, a lot of the damage will already have been done. It's kind of like saving for a pension, if you start off early and save a little, then by the time you come to retirement age your savings will have compounded over time.
---
Unfortunately, wardec changes were the equivalent of starting to save at 60, most of the potential has been lost to time and cannot be recovered, and you're left needing needing to pay in almost all your income just to hope to sustain the basics a few years from now.
---
We will never know how large the game might have been, if the population growth hadn't been undermined by what was near universally understood as a terrible mechanic. If only CCP had been willing to look at the evidence and slay one of their sacred cows sooner.
---
It dropped, you should go pick it up.
---
&gt; somewhere between Hello Kitty SKINs for caps and fixing local
---
so, somewhere in the whole spectrum?
---
Retards? Maybe some of them are. Most aren't. Most are just people who are vulnerable to those tactics. You don't have to be a retard to be a problem gambler and problems like that can appear just like that. It's the same reason why you don't tempt an alcoholic with "just one beer".

nullsec ores are linearly independent I think, when would I not have linear independence?
---
DE TERK ER JERBS
---
i think the rewards need to be tweaked, for sure. I also think that having all the rats warp off because you left the site is also rather hokey, because i had the boss eat through my tank and warp off. When i came back, they fought me for a second then they all warped away. if someone can't handle the site and needs to warp off, it's rather rude, especially when during the last gala they only would go away after like an hour of fighting the player, and i was only in the site for a few minutes, and had to leave once for another minute to restore my ship.
---
Does noone else prefer resolution to AA/post processing? It's not even close in my mind. Res first (up to a limit; usually 1440p is plenty, but way better than 1080p)

Yes, which is where the Tiamat and Hydra came from.

Who else is going to pressure CCP on the hard issues like salvage drones plush toys and New Eden Monopoly - Goon Edition - Already Replaced.

Not to sound pessimistic.. but CCP has been saying this for what feels like 1.5 to 2 years. I feel like this is a generic input to try to stem the initial uproar over no AT by throwing a bone to those that want balance changes instead of UI stuff.
---
It would be nice to know what they actually plan on "rebalancing" and some kind of time frame, instead of a generic statement. It would also be great, if they actually communicated this somewhat ahead of time and not 2 weeks before the patch is deployed so they can get some decent input on whatever it is that they're balancing.
---
Maybe i'm asking for too much though.
---
ksig why didn’t you form muninns we could have saved them and given phorde a epic brawl
---
Imagine playing a game where there are monthly blog posts on ratting and mining scores but no combat updates or PvP tournaments. Even the killboard is run by 1 player in his spare time, otherwise there would be nothing.
---
fuck cxp

425s dont track well :/

someone has to mine for the materials needet to replace those fails ;P .

pretty sure, yeah. there were other people who wanted it back, but maybe we were all being dumb together XD

2019 is PLs most successful AT in years.

Congrats guys, you deserved it.

yep, you're right, i see that now. The back end is almost completely at Ogre. Then its using 150mm autocannons, same model. The 200mm's are double barreled.

and still spodbrains deny the game is on a slope lmao.

Surprised people have not seen the writing on the wall. EVE is literally dying. CCP are scrapping whatever resources they have left to squeeze the money out of you addicts.

And most people (like me) don't need to get prizes to have fun practicing, theorycrafting and flying in the tournament.

This event was fucking stupid. I was excited to do some grinding for it, had my ship ready to go, sent my scout alt out in an Ares to find a constellation with a Gala event available to bring my main into, and spent about 4 hours flying around and never even saw a single event. I tried Googling and following Twitch streams to see if I was missing something, reset my fucking UI to see if maybe it just wasn't showing up on my overview, and nothing. I sold my ship after sitting in it for 6 hours, and I will never waste my time on another in game event like this. I got better shit to do. 
---
not surprising, but still a disappointment. 
---
Sorry for the necro. I just read the blurb for that series and it sounds super interesting. Any other civilization you remember?

Alaska fucking loves eve online.

:( damn
---
When meeting the merger financial goals goes in priority over hiring the people to arrange the last bit of community events you still have left in your game...

For shame

I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if hundreds of voices suddenly cried out in autistic rage and were suddenly silenced
---
Ty. Now my desktop at workie
---
Yes.   I think a lot of the choices CCP has made in Eve the last two years have been marketing related.  First pushing accelerators and then the sale to PA requiring them to try and boost performance.  They are clearly concerned about subs and want to make the game more approachable to new players. I Ithink they see positive results and decided to follow that progress.  Unfortunately there is an optimal level where you are making as many people happy as possible and you are not making too many people unhappy.  Injectors made some people happy , but in a short time many people unhappy.  Augmentation boosters made people happy but they could not be easily monetized.  Now with gating them behind ISK they have a way to monetize them in a round about way.
---
&gt;Just like EVE Fanfest, the Alliance Tournament will return
---
just like shield slaves, angel capitals and module balance
---
This is actually so fucking stupid. Im actually really fucking mad. 
---
&gt;For 2019 though, we want to make sure we’re fully focused on improving quality of life in New Eden, working on balance concerns that have been highlighted by the community and delivering awesome new content for capsuleers across the cluster to enjoy.
---
I'm real glad they had to kill AT to be able to allocate resources to game balancing. I'm sure the couple hours a YEAR fozzie spends making the ruleset will absolutely go to game balancing. Cancelling a one time yearly tournament that they almost completely outsourced to the community last year so they can BALANCE THE GAME. What sort of negative IQ smooth brain logic is that. 
---
Your tournament community knows you dont give a shit CCP. Every year we have to feel bad because you wont fucking pay your employees a couple of weekends so we can have our fucking yearly tournament. Every year we wait with 0 communication hoping we will still get a tourny this year. Last year you're the ones that killed your participation after the year before was one of the biggest successes due to 0 communication, late announcements, no info about rewards. 
---
We're for a good part the same group of small gang players you've been shitting on for years, and this is no surprise you'd finally take away the last reason any of us would have to care about this game. 
---
Wow actually just end it all. Thats it I'm ready for this garbage to be over. 
---
I think the only peeps complaining about faucets would be those that dont have access to one.
---
So at half an hour per site to run and clear and mine it, we have to run 11 sites to build one basic booster that's +6. that's 5 and a half hours to build one basic booster.  Do tell me how that's viable / worth it / even remotely fun? 
---
"time passes when you play EVE?"  
---
\-The Sleepers, probably
---
preach it brother 
---
It would be the best for CCP to tell us what they have in store for EVE this year. Since End of 2018 the only thing we hear are bad news and / or bad patches. We need some old EVE magic back.
---
\- CCP: hey AT is coming   
---
\- CCP: hey we had to fire the community team for no reason   
---
\- CCP: hey no more AT lmao

Well the Palatine can't move, so there's not much you can do with it. With this, you could at least do something with it.

What's your point?

A custom launcher isn't modifying the client or using a replacement client. I'm not sure whether it counts as connecting to the servers using third party software because you're still using the official EVE client, but it has been condoned in the past and a dev even made an [unofficial Linux launcher](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=482663).

CCP Eterne saying modifying the launcher is not okay, but no comment on third party launchers. Chribba says other CCP employees have told him they're not forbidden. There was an older thread than this that was locked pending investigation, but I don't think it was ever followed up on publicly.

You'd think if third party launchers weren't allowed they'd just say so since they've spoken about them multiple times. I can understand my WTB thread being locked if they no longer want to look like support it by having discussion of it on their forums. However, I was still scammed in a way that, as far as I know, is forbidden and I feel that should be sorted out.
---
to be fair, zkill does such a good job that there's generally no point in trying to compete
---
however, even if it wasn't nearly as good as it is, its not really worth the time anymore
---
Not surprised this year, although it still sucks balls.
---
eve is dying blah blah blah...

Except it really feels like it now
---
eve dead by 2021
---
Well i guess you are right, but how do you know you're done with "balance"?
---
That's it? That graph looks like a 25% erect dick. Limp and unambitious. Try harder.
---
Being generous that CCP knows. How long have war decs been going on before they realised it wasn't great for new players to begin with.
---
Imagine being so self-centered as to not concede the notion that different people have different views on what is fun and cool.
---
It's okay guys they are replacing AT with 10v10 abyssal pvp
---
Who ever said mining was dying?
---
What?

I was expecting you to swear dude. Come on, step your game up !

If you're going for an eye candy shot you want both. 4k on medium settings just looks like shit, case in point, that keepstar model.

&gt;the Alliance Tournament will return
---
No, no it won't.
---
Super stoked to have 30 guys show up to our first practice last week after quite a rough year in 2018, boundless enthousiasm even though most are new and we're met with this shit. Atleast they didn't wait untill the last month to inform us. 
---
Use Linear Algebra applications.
---
Please no, without you game will be the same
---
Simply put, there is no (and should ever be) a "done" with balance. EVE is far too complex to be perfectly "balanced".  
---
What people want when we say "balance changes" is a shift in the meta. Make weak ships stronger and strong ships weaker. This can be done by rebalancing whole ship classes (like they did with assault frigates) or individually picking out weaker ships and making some tweaks and see what happens (zealot, Muninn, Navy Drake).
---
There will always be strong and OP ships, that is fine. I just don't want to see the same strong/OP ships for 3 years that are literally suffocating the meta \*cough\* capitals \*cough\*. We need movement of the meta, not stagnation.
---
Excuse me, this is a high-risk pvp game.
---
How hard is it to just let EveNT run it? They actually care about the game and work their arses off making good, enjoyable small scale tournament content.
---
This is just yet another big 'fuck you' to people who enjoy fighting in this game instead of watching your ore stash grow bigger.
---
It's more of a "why bother" attitude at this point. Bap lays out most peoples' thoughts fairly well in his reply.
---
Posts you linked are from 2 years ago. Falcon's post was made month ago so clearly stance about third party launchers have changed.   
---
Thread OP asked for launcher creation service and thread was shot down by customer support, as non permitted and violating the EULA.
---
Fuck you CCP
---
Fucking pissy shit COCK
---
is that better
---
So I'm OK with CCP choosing not to dedicate resources to the AT... BUT why not contract it out then?
---
There has to be a solution where the AT carries on but CCP doesn't have to babysit it directly.
---
The AT generates too much excitement and goodwill to not have. 
---
put your money where your mouth is and biomass while you're at it, will need an update after 10 hours to confirm.

This... is so incredibly disappointing. I was looking forward to participating in the AT with Brave this year. CCP just cannot seem to grasp what the community cares about.

As one of the 10 people up here in Alaska, can confirm, we love Eve. &lt;3

It's quite baffling how little it seems CCP cares about player retention among some of their most active/involved players. I'm sure they have a metric somewhere which says it's not worth spending time on frequent updates related to balance/mechanics/AT, but the most recent event just seems to show they're completely out of touch with their player base.
---
Nice post, Bap
---
CCP I'm very disappointed. This was going to be the first year our team participated and we had already started practicing. This is the first real announcement since the PA acquisition where I felt like EVE actually is dying.

&gt; For 2019 though, we want to make sure we’re fully focused on improving quality of life in New Eden, working on balance concerns that have been highlighted by the community
---
Commitment to balance? Okay let's take a look at last year (all info taken from Eve updates):
---
* Februrary - Upwell 2.0, no iteration since then. ADC / AF rebalance with no iteration besides a light retri nerf a couple months down the line (enyo / ishkur still basically useless).
---
* Mar - Fatigue, sov, iteration that probably should have happened years ago. Also light balance pass for ships
---
* Jul - another light balance pass for ships - MORE OF THESE PLEASE
---
* Oct - ECM changes, no iteration since (most ECM hulls still useless, RIP widow pilots). Combat ceptor changes to finally kill swordfleets which have been a problem since aegis sov was introduced. Hilariously unpopular hictor changes that were thankfully looked at again after outcry from wormholers. And a Damavik change that somehow made the ship even less popular than it already was.
---
* Nov - FAX Balance Pass
---
That's five total, less than one per two months. No balance passes in 2019 so far. CCPls if you're going to "commit" to balance, you need to learn to iterate.

---
What an absolute spodbrain.
---

---
They're two years old because they're the only relevant posts about it. CCP gave us no indication that policy had changed. I'm not even sure if it has, or whether Falcon misunderstood what I was requesting. I'm fine with not using a third party launcher if it's not allowed, but I want them to actually say that.
---
None of that changes the fact that I was scammed using a forbidden scam. I don't even care about the ISK (it's like like 0.03% of my wealth), it's the principle that they might be allowing forbidden scams if you retroactively break a new rule. I also don't like how hidden the 'don't scam using real life services' and which real life services you are allowed to sell for ISK rules are.
---
Tbh, I'd be okay with it if they brought back the different clone levels/states.
---
Make eve painful again.
---
at least the fight was good
---
Tomorrow.
---
Where are you take the tilde tilde tilde meta game tilde tilde tilde so seriously that your first reaction to ccp killing off one of their marquee events that a lot of players base their game play around was to talk shit about another alliance. No wonder you guys can't theory craft your way out of a brown paper bag.
---
F U CCP. After 4y of pvp grinding I finally feel decent enough and also would have a very good chance to join a decent team to measure myself against other long term high lvl pvpers. As the current meta doesn't help my gameplay any way...again F U CCP. I was following AT stuff for my entire eve career. Now this. This was an actual eve goal. F U 
---
Its taking longer to sink in to some, and while it was technically happening beforehand, Eve has been dying since F2P.  
---
Anytime an organization goes from a paid membership, to letting everyone in the door. Its dead.
---
At least Apex Legends came out so I can get some smallgang action there. Very high IQ move right here, galaxy brain way of telling the competitive player base that you don't care about them.
---
jezus christ no one cares 
---
:(
---
okay?
---
You can contract all your assets to doctor awox, thanks.
---
I'm also pissed because this year we actually managed to get enough people together to create a team only for this to happen.
---
News flash for you CCP newer players actually wanted to participate in this as well as veterans and now we have nothing to look forward to.
---
Was the equivalent of a golf tournament. Boring and good riddance 
---
awwwww.  this was one of the events i looked forward to T.T
---
It would perhaps be disingenuous to suggest that no-one inside CCP knew. Some of them do play the game on private accounts and I'm sure more than a few have seen their casual corps fall apart in the face of a wardecs from CampersRUs fielding T3s and neutral logi.
---
However, that's why I said it took them too long to slay the sacred cow... I get the sense that wardecs were part of the "EVE is hard" mentality and they didn't want to be seen to take away from that on ideological grounds.
---
Unfortunately, dealing with wardec spam was hard in the same way that trying to defend yourself against an armoured tank column with nothing more than a pencil is hard. Unless you're John Wick, at best you can hide and let it pass, and at worse you're getting your house exploded and a tank tread churning over your face. 
---
Stop looking me like that, you perv.
---
sad to say this, but yes
---
There have been many riot in jita I'm unsubbing all 100 accounts overreactions over the last few years, but this is the first one where it's just sad. The AT was my World Cup. My superbowl.
---
I'm not mad, just acceptant that it's the time to let eve peacefully slip out of my life.
---
Would be dumb to expect that indeed
---
Uh, He left a little after, IIRC he met with Matshi Rasih after Matshi did the whole scanning Jamyl Sarums Titan, Which shortly after he scanned it got blown up by the huge drifter fleet.
---
So He left a few months after they started showing up, But just as the major attack happened.
---
Mining? Dying? Bro it's 2019 if you don't have 5 rorqs to play ~~Farmville~~ eve online and watch your wallet balance tick up you're doing it wrong.
---
lmao they put autocannons on an Ogre
---
Its alright.
---
Not shocking seeing as couldn't even get enough teams last year
---
ok
---
GG Eve.
---
HAHAHAHAHA
---
Your just looking at it wrong.

Capital balance = people injecting enmass into carriers
---
What a disgrace
---
I think a corporations should really care about their members and the higher ups shouldn't just care about their bottom line.
---
It's not all about making money. I think a corporation should care about the products they make and community that they impact.
---
Oh we're not talking about CCP??? LMAO get fucked
---
Ahh fuck, EVE really is dying...
---
wasnt it like that after all? everytime i came across a drifter hole it had literally 25+ wormholes. always thought that was a travel hub by design.
---
There ya go, those events all happening in conjunction is what makes me feel the jove/drifter conflict is going to be a big lore thing in the future. Only time will tell though!
---
Wait this is a black flag post, the event must be amazeballs and you just want to keep all the loots yourself..........oh wait 🤔
---
Thanks for releasing me CCP
---
Take care everyone o//
---
if you extracted biology before the event you could consume the booster every 16 hours. You can get 30 million SP from the event.
---
It's understandable though, it's probably tough to come up with a ruleset for titans, supers and FAX. Like do you allow both sides to anchor a Keepstar first, or only a Fort? Will there be asteroids on field so the Rorqs can PANIC? Lots of hard questions.
---
This is what I am wondering to, we really have no idea what they are doing right now, feels more like its on full maintenance mode until it dies. 
---
Guess I'll be seriously considering letting my 50 accounts lapse. A core part of why I play this game is the Alliance Tournament and with everything else going on in this game, this is a clear and blatant sign that "PVP" in Eve will never be the same again.
---
People seem to forget that fatigue was an _addition_ to the game. We've done this before. We've had years of fatigueless movement throughout space, and you know what happened? The big groups dropped a huge dick on anyone doing anything remotely fun, from literally across the galaxy. Fatigue is not a shit system designed by a known moron. We, the players, ASKED for it during a time when people wanted to PvP. Now that the average person doesn't really want fights in the way that they used to and major nullsec powers are the de facto playstyle, all of a sudden people don't want fatigue anymore.
---
When fatigue is a barrier to getting helldunked, people are all for it. When fatigue is a barrier to helldunking others, suddenly people are against it. Color me fuckin shocked.
---
They couldn't figure out how to balance capitals for it, try again next year
---
Biomass does nothing, just means you have to fire off an email to support when you come back.
---
(super) carriers = carriers and super carriers.
---
welcome to the real life, AT-nerds!  
---
:pepesad:
---
Well, I think I'm out. There's no eve for me to play anymore. AT practices were the last place where skillful pvp actually seemed to matter and you didn't have to worry about getting a cap blob dropped on your head. Eve just isn't for us anymore I guess.

&gt;I would much rather see Logi appearing on killmail and BRs first before they changed anything else about killmails.

YES. THIS THIS THIS. People would fly logi so much more often if this happened.
---
Results based. The EVE server would just say to the Valk server, "You need to fight 2 drones" and then the Valk server replies, "The Valk fighter died to those two drones, blow them up on your side"
---
Kinda came to the realization it often takes like 2 hours to START to play eve.
---
I can’t understand how CCP possibly thinks that this is ok. 
---
Last time veldspar reprocess affected it. 
---
Ask a goon to test it. I heard every ore reprocess to 5 was mandatory for enlistment along with furry convention attendance. 
---
I hate to admit it, but yeah, it kind of feels like that.
---
I went on a nostalgia trip a week or so ago and went through old CCP Balance posts (about marauders, recons, battleships etc) and it was great seeing them talking about those balances and their reason. Then seeing them actually respond to comments about ships that weren't even about that balance pass.
---
I recall Rise popping into a forum thread and asking "What do you guys about if we made the tempest a 5% damage and 7.5% RoF bonuses, would that make it better?" Then sure enough, thats what got added to the tempest eventually to make it a pretty effective, cheap, battleship.
---
Stuff like that never happens anymore. Then when they do provide balance passes, its more of a "here is what we came up with after 30min of deliberation, we put 25m3 of drones on zealot, done, not going to listen to feedback, its already on SiSi and ready to launch on TQ."
---
&gt; Oct - ECM changes, no iteration since (most ECM hulls still useless, RIP widow pilots). 
---
Wow, thanks! I didn't read past patch posts when coming back to the game this month. Curious about the ECM nerf, I read the OCT notes and realized I've been ubering all over null, incorrectly thinking my Claw could get me out of bubbles. 
---
How many wraiths? Are the sleepers maybe the wraithes?
---
I get that. I guess what I'm saying is, they should think about new ways to integrate the game and the real world like players do.
---
Wait...other people exsist????
---
This is probably the final nail in the coffin for me, and I probably wouldn't have flown in AT this year anyways. Bap's 100% correct, feelsbadman 
---
Yeah I blew all my money on it too. :)
---
Eve is dying.
---
You look at all the broken and unfinished things, constant screwups, and this.. its hard to figure out what they actually care about anymore. Honestly I give it 2-3 years before it just fizzles into nothing, but holding out hope that someone at CCP does something spectacular to turn the boat around.
---
64bit with Linux?
---
You know all those engineers, IT staff and such they brag plays this game? Some of us use Linux to game also.
---
TLDR you can still target whatever is jamming you. Not much else to learn from the blog iirc
---
Ok, so AT **and** Fanfest are cancelled this year?  What gives?  Is Pearl Abyss the problem?  I mean, was the monument in Reykjavik the pinnacle achievement of Eve Online players?
---
you still can work on a float-value problem and then use the found float-solution as a limiting factor. For many issues this can help restrict the scope of the problem, and knowing the minimum and maximum values of your objective function can improve the search time by several levels of order.
---
Just saying, using float-approx in a integer-problem is a common way to help solve it.
---
Hopefully they're just bamboozling us. Last year they said they weren't going to have prize ships, but they turned around. Hopefully this year is like crescendo bamboozle. 
---
Although in all honesty, I'm kind of sad. I really like the alliance tournament. :(
---
Don't forget, still no information on any kind of balance changes, except "we plan on doing some kind of balance change at some point, maybe next month, maybe next year, but we will do them, eventually."
---
Wow. I've long been dissapointed with the content CCP has made, and the direction the game's taken, and this is just another damn nail.
---
Can you give your stuff to new players then?
---
Would much prefer if they were honest:
---
'We got rid of gambling with Eve online since we were scared of getting in trouble with regulators and law suits, since then the popularity of AT matches has plummeted.  The marginal PR and small % of player-base involved means we do not feel its worthwhile to continue investment'.
---
The bit about balance... since they know lots of the AT players also do small gang... comical.
---
Gottem
---
Right after they finish the battleship and battlecruiser rebalances, which will be right after tiericide.
---
I remember hearing about the AT even during the years I wasn't playing EVE, I don't think CCP understand the marketing value of the AT...
---
I new two hardworking toons that brought in t2 bpo's, it was only mostly rigged.

independent means you can't express one of them as the result of a linear composition of others. If you can, then you can find a smaller base that express the same space with one less dimension.
---
for example, if my space is defined by the bases (one lemon, one orange) the two bases are independent, but if it is expressed by (one lemon, 2.5 lemons) then it is not.
---
good
---
This. Fuck the low effort profiteering bullshit.
---
My only hope at this point is that after the incentive period of the PA acquisition is over CCP will reinvest in the game and replace the lost staff. At this point its only a pipe dream though.
---
Honestly, I don't Blame PA for any of this, This shitshow is on CCP and CCP alone. And they can get fucked for choosing to slowly tear their game apart.
---
yeah I think it might be overdefined
---
The sad part is they already cancelled a player-run tournament right after they decided to fire their entire community team, and then remembered they had nobody left to run the tournament servers.
---
Was the bad event to distract us from this? or the other way around?
---
shitty ui developments nobody asked for out the ass but no AT
---
this game is rapidly circling the drain
---
Sept 6, 2018
---
It's scary how little ccp cares about this community and qmes future. 
---
I'm in middle of moving and let my subs expire during that time. Why bother coming back when there is no future here
---
Good fucking shit, need to read this more deeply sometime.
---
I am disappoint. I was excited when we left PL, we would get out AT team back. :( 
---
I like the CCP bashing posts but at the same time consider all idea/suggestion threads here trash.
---
Could we please keep the hate but without ideas pls?
---
Bots can’t think tho
---
/s
---
"Okay CCP, so this is a gun. See where the trigger is? Good. And this is your foot. Under no circumstances you should ever sh-
---
GODDAMIT!"
---
This game is an abomination hooked up to life support designed to keep players logging in and paying cash. I feel bad for their employees who have to wear more and mote hats as coworkers leave or their positions are eliminated.
---
Actually just a sad feeling. No Memes, just sad.
---
fuck you enyos are fucking great!!!!!
---
MCAV is recruiting btw
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
I'm the same, I got a few loot boxes and the rewards were terrible. The carrier fight with some corp mates was fun but this event doesn't feel good to run.
---
If it does come back part of me expects they'll make it a cap brawl instead.
---
Nobody wins EVE for too long. See you in a week.
---
Aww, no yearly dole payment for you!
---
You will be back
---
Damn.  The AT was one of the main things that kept me into EVE as long as I stayed.  Certainly what hooked me in to begin with, flying with Star Fraction against BoB.  Probably singlehandedly accounts for the ten years I put into the game and the odd itch I get to log back in around AT time to see what's up.  
---
Sad days.  If they're doing it, I'm sure they have very good reason, but still, ouch.
---
I've toyed with and even did some work on the idea of a zkill competitor/replacement. Every time though I always end up dropping it for the simple fact that all you can really do is make it a bit faster and give it a better search. It's also hideously expensive to operate.
---
Fuck this shit.
---
I cannot kill Kritsan Parthus in the Sisters of Eve mission. I managed to kill the small pirate ships surrounding him and I engage him in closed combat, orbit 500m. He does not hit me once but I just don't deal enough damage. I fitted 3x 200mm autocannon I with ems ammo. I also tried other ammo but I never do enough damage, he repairs too fast. I fly a Merlin frigate.
---
how can one company make the exact wrong decisions over and over again consistently 
---
jesus they must be intentionally doing this at this point
---
Wow. Disappoint. First no more gambling on the AT and now just no more AT. The AT brought people together in eve. And the big swinging dick you get to have with prize ships or the bragging rights from killing one. Wtf are you thinking CCP?! 
---
Step 1:announce prizes and stats 6 months before tournament.
---
Step 2:listen to player feedback on prize stats
---
Step 3: watch everyone fight for prize ships because they had a say and actually play the damn game instead of not putting t2 resists on a t2 hull.
---
Hey CCP. Your PA acquisition is starting to show in your shitty events and your best one being cancelled.
---
p o l a r i z e d 
---
t o r p s
---
i feel like the actual answer for why the AT isn't happening this year is that they fired the guy who does the server backend stuff for it on thunderdome, whose name escapes me
---
If they offered actual balance changes this would be OK. Not having a balance team doesn't bode well on this front, though. 
---
Still pretty new myself so take my advice with a grain of salt but I believe they recommend a Destroyer hull for the DPS on him... Ask in Local and get a buddy to fleet up.
---
but you see, iteration effects the sandbox and CCP can't influence the player to player interaction of it's pristine environment 
---
(actual ccp reasoning against quick iteration)
---
Newton's third law is crying in a corner somewhere.
---
/u/makotopriano anything new going on in the drifter worm holes? 
---
I think I´m watching too much Steven Colbert recently but I read that in his usual Trump imitation voice. Perfect match.
---
Tbh at this point I don’t really give a shit about any kind of message. It’s gonna be a mixture of playerauctions and give stuff to the few remaining idiot friends that stay around. I’m sorry for your gate, at this point I’m fairly sure it won’t happen before server shutdown. You tried your best, no regrets.
---
You guys would put blasters on everything if you could :P 
---
From what I've heard, I'm skipping this event - not worth the time.
---
ya shit can’t have astrahut vs astrahut alliance tournaments cuz they can’t anchor close enough
---
maybe next year!
---
How do I play this game? HELP!
---
I agree with the OP and have posted these sentiments everywhere I could.
---
CCP said that they went with BPCs and all that for miner inclusion, but they absolutely didn't have to do miner inclusion at the cost of exclusion of so many other players.
---
The best event they had was the one that had increasing difficulty waves spawning. The 1st wave was easy and dropped lowest rewards, done by new players and alphas. 2nd was so / so, and the final wave was just challenging enough so that even most vet players have lost some ships or were unable to get the reward from time to time
---
Furthermore, I wonder if they haven't done this shit on purpose to force injectors on newbs (especially mining), thus $$$. Standard bait and switch. Start of easy then increase, increase and boom, throw them a cliff to overcome with an ingame $$$ system that will let them do that.
---
im surprised at how you consistently make such bad posts
---
You're saying your peak EVE experience is to be in the fighter of the carrier that dropped on a lone Gila?
---
Maybe the players can host one somewhere?
---
It'd be difficult with the lack of GM powers for moving people, etc, but if enough people got interested it could be a decent event.
---
&gt;asking ccp to iterate on a balance change in less than 2 years
---
lol
---
The linear independence just guarantees that the matrix A^T A will be invertible. Go ahead and try to invert the matrix: if you can, you're fine, and if not, you know why.  :D
---
Literally what does that have to do with anything
---
You mean since before the game was launched. People have been bemoaning CCP and the death of eve from the second they started playing
---
**Buh bye...**
---
it's one of the most low effort easily multiboxed activities in eve.
---
that alone will ensure it's never going to die out.
---
if people aren't maxing isk/hour then they're maxing effort/isk when it comes to earning isk.
---
Since they found the new store cash cow, i guess they care more about the guys and girls playing dress up doll with their ships and characters.
---
New Eden Fashion Show will replace the AT.
---
Yea, or if they'd paired this with the announcement that fighters will no longer be able to target falcons/widows jamming them, that would be one thing. 
---
But reading recent patches makes it feel like they've forgotten about balance in general, including everything they ever promised to iterate on, so I kinda doubt there'll be *any* useful balance changes. We're getting nothing in return for this. (And considering how little effort CCP puts into running the AT, we shouldn't expect anything - it's not like they just freed up a thousand hours of devtime.) 
---
And CCP continues to ignore the players that are the content generators which make this game worth sticking around for.  
---
This is foolish, short sighted, and demonstrates a complete lack of awareness regarding where the life blood of this game really is, PVP.  
---
Situation normal. We can't go 3 months without CCP pissing off the player base about something, can we? That would be weird.
---
Hey, now. Don't confuse "bad" with "something I disagree with." It's not bad posting to assert that the only value the AT had was for generating wealth for a small number of colluding assholes. An unpopular opinion? Absolutely. Bad? No.
---
Who wants my stuff?
---
They are in the middle of restructuring and adjusting to their new overlords.
---
That takes time.
---
Same applies to non-super carriers. Would you buy a game where you occasionally find a session and as soon as you load the scene, you'll notice that you're up against red crosses once again?
---
Where were you when AT was kill?
---
I was en route to station and making a pizza when Falcon post.
---
"AT is kill"
---
"no"
---
Maybe they'll finally allocate resources to bringing VNI's bandwidth down to 100, increasing bandwidth and dronebay by 25 on the drone Proteus for a sexy hyperStrat.
---
The last at was already done without logibro. So it’s just a matter of priorities.
---
I don't give a fuck about pvp or the AT as a pvp thing.
---
however, the AT was the one thing ccp did consistently every year - and even though i was never really that consumed by it as other players, it's something they did pretty well each year.
---
it's pretty fucking concerning, no matter what you think about the AT itself, that CCP have just cancelled one of the few things they do consistently, and do well.
---
Super interesting 
---
Don't worry they'll make a new balance team that they can scrap the month after yet again.
---
doesn't it need a role in order to get a role bonus?
---
orange man bad
---
It was already dead 
---
So you are dependent on free intel to take fights. Should people also self-destruct so you dont risk losing a ship?
---
You need to upship to a destroyer
---
I feel sorry for falcon at this point. He's being told by the higher ups to push shit out and make decisions that are clearly not what he wants and its these decisions that ultimately will probably end his job when the game dies. This really is the death knell of the game. As a vet for 10 years I'm saddened. At this point would anyone be surprised if they said the servers were being shut down tomorrow? I wouldn't. Bye ccp 
---
That’s funny. 😆 
---
Has lost caedes, according to you to afraid to take fights.
---
\*Nerd rage\*
---
Ditto.  
---
But have SO much more ISK now. 
---
1. Majority of player base in Goons/TEST/HORDE.
---
2. Majority of player base actively mine.
---
3. CCP obviously sees this and make event for most active players.
---
So what's the problem? 
---
Not even /s anymore, because it is pve sandbox with occasional laggy mass pvp. 
---
And it's not like you are any different from people who are expected to like this event. After all you are not the guy who sit in event site w8ing for someone to bite and get pvp, right?
---
Link to changes, please?
---
Should have checked zkb as usual then. Maybe accidents dont happen in the future.
---
Lol
---
And before it got rolled back to be less aids, there was a year of like zero wars between blocs because it was too awful to fly anything but interceptor fleets.
---
I actually am strongly against big / wealthy groups helldunking on people. But the way I see it, the way to fix that isn't to make it so hard to get into a fight that weaker groups are safe. That doesn't work -- as I said the map geography just doesn't have space for that. You fix the helldunk problem by making the dunks less hellish. Delete supers, nerf the fuck out of logi, make fights more bloody for both sides. 250 guys in rifters should be mildly scary, not a boson-bait joke.
---
Players ask for things that are the most obvious response to the problem they see in front of them. 9 times out of 10 that fix will make things very temporarily better before either regressing back to the mean, or finding out there are unintended consequences that are just as bad. Treat the disease, not the symptoms.
---
nope, no players were leaving. if they were ccp wouldve mentioned retention numbers which were absent
---
This thing looks like my annual performance review.  2 goals that I've completed to make it look like I've already made progress, something I'm doing with no idea when it will be done, and something that I say is being worked on but have no real plan or means of measuring progress.
---
Sure, but hey, have you seen what asteroids looked like in 2008?
---
is tiny still CEO? Because if not I will unironically put an enyo alt in for memes
---
&gt; Getting things done around here is like mating elephants.
---
&gt; It is done in high places with a lot of moaning and takes 2 years to produce results.
---
BRB, CCP will remove it from the game while they ponder how to revitalize it 🤔
---
I hear it's a good idea to get upset about a monthly post that is generated by a script running queries on a database, requiring all of 20 minutes of work at most a month. Clearly, the Alliance Tournament or whatever balance changes you want could have fit into that time.
---
People answered already about the destroyer but I need to point out that you need to take a look at the traits tab when you show info on different ship hulls. 
---
A Merlin gets bonuses to hybrid weapons (blasters for short range and rail guns for long range). You don’t want to be use a projectile system which is what auto cannons are as the ship is giving you no bonuses to those weapons. 
---
there is a difference between encouragement and having a broomstick shoved up your ass.
---
It **is** very dumb
---
&gt; Pop up mission
---
&gt; There is a war in blah system. 
---
&gt; Do you want to transfer your consciousness to one of the fighters on a friendly ship there?
---
horde man sad
---
Never thought I would agree with a Querns post... 
---
literally would be infinitely better than the empty promises (lies) they're offering here
---
"This is for abandoning me in that last fight." 
---
*Flies off and doesn't attack the Gila*
---
&gt; I don't give a fuck about pvp
---
people saying retarded shit like this is why ccp are making turbokrab online
---
r/gaming is a trash sub tho
---
Do you have a source for this? I would love to see the full context, especially since off the top of my head I can think of two times I had a lot of fun caused almost exclusively by CCP's changes (moon mining rebalance -&gt; Fountain War, Outpost Conversion -&gt; Skillu vs DRF)
---
&gt; I started playing Eve Online 2 years ago.
---
Fuck so Eve 2 is out already?
---
Sounds like emergent game play to me! :D
---
I don't think these autistic voices will be silenced any time soon
---
fuck man if it could give ECM back to blops groups and nerf fax reps again I'd take it no questions asked
---
This is a big post for a 2 year, tbh.
---
The Mail had the station where I am at right now in it,that's what i wanted to keep secret,
---
 couldnt give a fuck if you guys know my name or fit :D
---
Last op didn't turn anything up; basically status quo. We're definitely keeping an eye on things, though.
---
then maybe they should give me a reason to give a fuck about it?
---
Bap 0% attendance this year.
---
Add the 3week delay on customer/ticket support.. 
---
Tying clone stuff to standings? Oh you sweet summer child.
---
You can now start winning Eve instead of the AT tournament.
---
I think they're trying to get newbs to spend $$$ so they buy injectors for mining and whatever else they need for these events. Look at the past good events and then how shitty these last ones were (are). Standard Bait and Switch tactic.
---
They're doing a world tour instead.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pjzslc/eve-online-world-tour-2019
---
&gt;1.5 to 2 years
---
Hahahahahaha you must be new
---
Dropped everything to low while I was playing Dota and afk mining, Spod literally looks like a post-peabinge turd
---
In all my years playing Eve I've never had any personal interest in participating in the AT, but I think that their being so willing to so flippantly cancel it is a huge red flag as to how little CCP understands or cares about this game.
---
It's going to hurt for a while, but you're not alone and the pain goes away slowly but surely while the relief of being *done* replaces it.
---
I really gotta stop crutching on dual webs :). As always any criticism is appreciated.
---
Because it's fun to talk trash. What, are you afraid that anything less than complete harmony in player opinion is going to cause the apocalypse or something? Are you that desperate for consensus?
---
Dammit /u/querns_gsf stop making me agree with your sarcasm.
---
yes you can come pick it up in GE-8
---
bring a freighter and wark to the fortizar
---
Not surprising tbh. 
---
CCP spent last 3 years allocating resources to cater to multi-account PvE and capital ship playstyle to unsustainably siphon the powercreep craze. It worked well until the sale to PA. Subs and profits were temporarily buffed since many people got into Rorqual multiboxing and used so much PLEX and injection. CCP cared more about this folk who plays Eve for asset acquisition similar to someone who plays WoW for the next epic item. Mega alliances cared more about this folk as they provided +1s in their titan fleets. 
---
As a result, any area of this game which required skill, innovation, creativity, intelligence from the player was either on purpose or collatterally nerfed, or at best ignored, as a financial choice. From selectively recruiting alliances to solo BLOPS, from small gangs in null to whalers, people in every such activity have their playstyle worse than what it was a few years ago. Culture changed as a result to the extent that "elite pvp'er" became an insult. Was only a matter of time before the same thing hit to AT.
---
Here is the sad thing. Did you notice excavator prices dropped from 1.2b to 800m? That tells you the market is oversaturated. Everyone who wants a Rorqual and play Eve that way has one now. Everyone who wants a super or a titan has one too. Last 3 years of changes were just a timebomb waiting to implode Eve once these miners acquired every asset they want. Because Eve is not WoW by game design. It can't keep releasing the next bigger ship or citadel like WoW releases the next 10 levels and the next legendary item set every year. Once people who play for asset acquisition have all their assets, they will have nothing to log in for. CCP forgot the real base keeping Eve alive for years is the folk who play for innovation, for creativity, for incredible amount of different areas this game offers for one to self-actualize their ambitions and make use of their skills, yielding incredible stories to tell for a lifetime.
---
It's only downhill from here unless there is some serious mentality change.
---
How do you improve tidi by focusing on fighters?
---
I quit the game last week, melted down my 40+ characters and gave the isk away lol. It's been a good run, and I hope it improves, but it's just lost it's magic for me. Too many bad game design choices. Don't feel like they're listening at all.
---
It's sad to see the decline of a video game you love to come back to.
---
And there is fuck-all about anything balance related in there. Cap balance? Rorqual balance? Citadel balance? Fucking nothing. 
---
I’m sure AT will be back next year, just as soon as CCP figures out how to make mining a competitive eSport.
---
“Thousands of tons of ore mined every weekend!”
---
Ffs. 
---
At this point it’s almost like they are intentionally trying to kill the game.
---
The writing was on the wall the moment they got acquired by the Black Desert Online guys. It's all Korean-style money siphoning now.
---
Haha, could do. I just wanted to have the token "Can I have your stuff" post before anyone else. Think I have a Freighter pretty close to GE-8
---
When I started asteroids were this really weird looking blobs, or spike metallic things, it looked really poor.
---
Now, dude, it’s one of the most peaceful things to do in there.
---
If anyone honestly thinks they're not bold-face lying to us on this, then they haven't been paying attention. 
---
I can finally win EVE now. It was a good run. 
---
I can't even....
---
I'll likely join you soon
---
"Both viewership and participation have fallen subsantially in the last few years, so it made sense to have a hiatus and look at what we can do to come back fresh."
---
you know because CCP has basically phoned it in the past few years?  if you put zero effort into AT, people aren't going to pay attention.  
---
Go fuck yourself CCP
---
AT canceled in favor of balance pass. Balance pass on your resumes perhaps?
---
Pretty much this 
---
Yeah that was kinda my thinking, I'd rather have the passive resists than the ADC for the sites, but for pvp the adc would've probably been better
---
&gt; It would be nice to know what they actually plan on "rebalancing" 
---
Tiericide of course you silly. 
---
Oh wait. 
---
&gt; If they're doing it, I'm sure they have very good reason, but still, ouch.
---
Pearly Abyss (instant $$$ &gt; long-term $$$)
---
I got everything back, I guess because no one looted it. The site was gone after I went back there with my ceptor alt
---
Here you go, change has been in place since December 6th
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pjblu1/war-declaration-changes-the-war-adjacent-to-christmas
---
To be fair, there's a lot more that goes into the AT than 4 hours from one dude. There's the logistics of organizing the entrants, checking to ensure that all teams/pilots are in order, flagships are sorted, etc.
---
Then there's the logistics of organizing the streaming, casting, and anything else involved with the hosting. This costs both time and money.
---
Also, there's the multiple weekends that are spent working by CCP staff running the tournament itself. 
---
Finally, there's the effort that has to go into designing awards, ships and skins included.
---
at least yours has a timer.
---
i got to 310 points and suddenly i only have 2 quests out of 4 available at all - not even a 10 year timer.
---
guess i'm not doing this event, oh well.
---
I actually got the mods back too, just wasn't blingy.
---
I remember those days, 2 miner Is on a little Navitas. Didn't realise they redesigned it till yesterday
---
Great idea. I’m really interested in hearing more.
---
But everyone knows reddit isn’t the place for this. Please forward all of your great game mechanic and balance ideas to the CCP devs. Just every thought you have, send it.  Straight to Hilmar, Falcon, and whoever is left at CCP.
---
It’s your game now dude, make it what you want. 
---
they won't get the job.
---
Savage.
---
CCP doesn't care about making money or being a company. 
---
You make me sad.
---
CCP pisses away money/resources/time on terrible games/projects using money from EVE. Projects fail/are cancelled due to terrible management decisions from start to finish.
---
EVE population contracts, and every decision since has been to squeeze as much cash from remaining customers as possible. Overcutting of personnel leads to continued decline in EVE experience, but boosts short-term viability as CCP is sold.
---
Thanks Hilmar.
---
Indeed... I decided to keep going for it, just to get the points and let those Fugly skins grabbing dust on my "Rare shit" container in jita &gt;.&gt;
---
I hope I manage to find a carrier, it seems to be a descent boss fight to get done with the mates o/
---
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ ISK PLEASE
---
Wow, can't even host an AT anymore. I thought they would find a way to monetize it like DOTA2, instead they just kill it and walk away. Pathetic weakness. 
---
&gt;ccp doing something actually reasonable or in any way connected to what eve was meant to be
---
your faith in humanity is too high to post here
---
But enjoy - there is loot box !
---
That's almost like evebet right?
---
Where do you go as an astero?
---
I barely find any monies
---
Couple of years ago the event dropped clothes, skins (some of which were actually rare), geckos, and quafe zero. All in the same event. I ran a shit ton of those sites, in low, so i actually got fights while doing it too.
---
/u/Casperrr_24 Out of curiosity, what's your take on this?
---
We know exactly what we're getting with an alliance tournament.
---
Instead of replacing it with worthless platitudes, give us a list of exactly what balance concerns you will be tackling and when they will be deliverable.
---
If you stole my steak and gave me a plate with IOU dinner written on it, then I'd want to know when you're going to buy me dinner and what you're buying.
---
Yeah I got on last night and was like, oh let me grind out some points. I completed all the tasks except "kill another capsuleer in a serpentis or angel ship" and I got like 50 points. And nothing. Everything is blank with no indication of how or when to get more points. And literally nothing drops at the site so wtf not gonna just sit there and blap npcs for no fucking reason.
---
The only changes are for corps with no structures at all. The war dec mechanics are still shit broken.
---
&gt; Ahhhh fuck
---
You dropped this. 
---
&gt;after speaking with the CSM we've decided to not hold an AT this year to focus on the things players really care  about; mining, skill injectors, and skins.
---
I honestly have no words - shock, anger, sadness.... relief that its over? no idea. But learned not to speak at times like this :P
---
maybe like 20-30 mins?
---
AT has been boring as shit for a few years now, and barely anyone watches it anymore
---
Why not increase the amount of minerals it takes to build?
---
Its not hard Mapped, Its that they CBA to do it.
---
I'll give you an example of CCP's ignorance from last year, Example being Theomachy. (Quoted from the organiser)
---
&gt;I am currently waiting to hear back from CCP Falcon to find out who has taken over management of the Thunderdome server after they let Logibro go.
---
 5/5/18
---
&gt;I have received no response yet, I will ask again but frankly I am getting annoyed
---
Alpha he was let go like 3 weeks after Eve Vegas last year, I was actually there and talked to him about Theomachy and he said to get back with him 2 weeks after Vegas was over and then as I was going to send an email I found out about it.
---
 18/6/18
---
&gt;welp some good news, CCP Falcon finally got back to me and forwarded me to CCP Guard, though since AT is soon it might not be be able to get Thunderdome access this year all depends.
---
 19/6/18
---
&gt;Have not heard anything after my last email most likely due to the whole being bought by that other company can't remember the name
---
  8/11/18
---
&gt;At that point it was confirmed theomachy was not happening for 2018, CCP showed they don't give a shit for others trying to run their own tournaments. 
---
But The organiser kept trying for 2019...
---
&gt;Unfortunately the last 2 months I have been extremely busy with work, ontop of some life problems. I have not even had a chance to get with CCP to see if they still want to do this. Though now that the holidays are over I can actually do that now
---
 30/12/18
---
&gt;Unfortunately despite emailing CCP Falcon a couple times over a month no answer
---
 16/1/19
---
We are now at 13/02/18, The organiser still has not heard back from CCP, Its just been sheer ignorance, People want to run tournaments, I'm sure people would Run the AT on behalf of CCP if they would only communicate and actually help people.
---
Remember this gem of an announcement? https://youtu.be/3C_dS-VmPec?t=50
---
Man, that team is really earning their paycheck!
---
If you ask me [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nrIcP_jheQ) (was) a lot of fun.
---
I better company would have paid that guy and bought zkill...
---
acceptant - adjective - rare   | nice
---
&gt;no info about rewards
---
Does this really matter? Wouldn't winning the AT be enough reward?
---
Try re-logging a few times, worked for me.
---
Also, dog shit thrash-tier event. Worst cum-stain bullshit ever. 
---
More likely that we have been krabbing so hard that event designers have been forced to make all future events isk neutral to avoid further damage to the economy. Hence we are paying more isk to open loot boxes than the rewards inside are worth
---
Shit so do I
---
some more eliteness, very nice 
---
And even with that, it really is only 'a bit' faster. Zkill isn't perfect, but it's good at what it does.
---

Surprising literally no one. I guess this is what happens when your fire most of your community team, huh?

without more frequent ship and economy balances(once a month soft touch type changes at the very least) eve is going to finally die. not sure if sad or happy

a good corp offers a buyback for ore, salvage and sometimes loot if they know what they are doing, generally 10% under prevailing market prices.   
---
corps should offer help getting into first capitals, supers and titans should provide goals for the group to move towards and drive opportunities for the members
---
No, you're right.  It disappeared for a day or two when the new client hit, but they pretty quickly added it back into the beta launcher and pushed the changes once everything looked good.

How do you figure that?

Fuck I'm on board with this. But that doesn't change the core problem - the big groups will still helldunk smaller groups with subs, especially now that there's no meaningful threat of escalation. But getting rid of supers, fax, and logi? Sign me up.

No

who cares about ingame wealth lmfao, the tourney was just straight up fun to fly in.

That was their plan. We have been krabbing so hard lately they were forced to make events isk neutral. Prove me wrong.
---
Most people are complaining CCP is adding loot boxes. I am just complaining they are implimenting them _poorly_
---
Fair enough. You were my favourite alliance lead, and I wish you guys the best in whatever you do next. Cheers Harvey, Raknor, Bronzer and crew. Say hi to Amari for me.
---
It’s intentional. CCP wants to stress test the new launcher 
---
I'd say that people who are actually in it for the PVP would agree with you. However, judging by the turnout in last year's AT, and a large amount of the posting ITT, that's far fewer folks than one might think.
---
STILL no excuse to be raging dick heads. It's a game. Chill.
---
Cool story
---
Because it is when fighters are deployed that tidi gets real. Too many things for the node to handle on top of ships, etc.
---
Isk neutral or not, the event failscaded on day1 because of poor design and lack of effort, in actuality it’s a recycled event with a change in mechanics, it’s not even truly new content. 
---
It’s also absurd to blame The company’s poor design choices on the players. Like are you somehow seriously trying to shift the blame to the player base for the development of this garbage content ?
---
You won't you are like an abused housewife.
---
Your the voice we need though.
---
It was also kind of a hot mess.
---
When I started in 2015 there was a road map that laid out lots of updates. Some stuff fell off but the structures generally came into existence at least. Now there's no roadmap.
---
have you ever met pl
---
I refuse to believe that anything at CCP is motivated by profiteering.  If they wanted money it would be so easy to make a fortune, they just don't want to give players things they'll buy.
---
Just look at the travesty of a skin market.  Half of the company is artists and they would rather have them work on concept art for other games than put skins in the store to sell.  Why can't I buy a $5 pair of aviators?  Why can't I drop $10 on a dress for my female pilot?  Why can't I get the pink rorqual skin in a capsule version?  Why are my only purchase options skins (for 1-2 hulls per design) and gametime?  Why not let me drop cash on a race change, or buy the hazard control for my thrasher when it already applies to a sabre, rifter, and cane? Imagine putting the time into making a skin and then only applying it to 3 ships before removing it from the store forever?  
---
Did you know that CCP has a merch store too?  You probably wouldn't, because they sell such high-demand items as an $8 salt shaker with a corpse on it, a $10 chinesium charging dongle, and a $15 passport holder...  God forbid I'm allowed to buy a CCP sticker, or a rifter mousepad, or even a damned poster.
---
Goons and Test have better merch stores than CCP, and it's all volunteer-run.
---
Sounds a bit like what happens when you, I dunno, fire a community team.
---
F indeed
---
As someone that hasn't played/kept up with eve for 12 months I thought this was legit at first and then I was sad when I realised it wasn't.
---
Yeah the thing is, it's profiteering just done extremely shit - even when the CCP merch store had nifty items, the postal costs were skyhigh, oftentimes more than the item itself.
---
low turnout was mostly due to the lack of communication about rules and prizes.
---
Anyways, I disagreed with 
---
&gt;that the only value the AT had was for generating wealth for a small number of colluding assholes. 
---
I couldn't care less that Hydra or Vydra or NC whoever the fuck got some AT ships. What I care(d) about is the theorycrafting, practicing,  participating in it, and finally betting on it/
---
The corporation should accept anyone into it that way you swell numbers very quickly.  It also allows tons of spais into it, so you put your spai accounts into this giant corp.  But then this corp get's so much great content that your spai accounts become your main accounts
---
&gt; No changes will be made next month, but we want to get a better idea on how to better balance these things
---
They said 3 months ago that is was complicated but they were going to look at it; so I expecting the changes any day now... their top people have been looking at it for 3 months... (https://media.giphy.com/media/HMHk1ooPJNT56/giphy.gif).
---
They did not say 3 months ago; in 3 months we are going to start looking at it.  Unless you are implying that they lied?
---
Watch the recent Talking In Stations podcast, CCP Fozzie was on there and he talked about it a bit. If my memory is correct, I believe the jist of what he said is that there was some good improvement but there's still more work to be done. I believe there's some mention about how their is more war participation now and more actual fighting even though their are way less wars and they are happy with that result.
---
Apex legends is p neat this time of year
---
Yes. They, like any alliance, have good dudes, great dudes, average dudes, and shitters. 
---
a BR circle is literally the only way that brawling will ever return to the meta.  Make welpcanes great again!
---
Hello Internet Explorer 🖐
---
CCP Big BOSS: Has the PR improved this month on reddit; excellent fire the balance team... again.
---
I'll sell you a minimization algorithm with current prices that gives you the cheapest option.
---
you can't truthfully deny the fact that their alliance is a fucking dumpster fire in tyool 2019, especially compared to how it and their allies used to be
---
Very much so
---
Like even given the value of AT ships, i suspect it would be like the worse isk per hour to run the AT for well isk. ( like yes if you win you make some isk but given the hours the winning team put in generally like it's absolutely not worth it for that alone ).
---
This has to be one of the dumbest decisions made ccp. You guys are obviously more concerned about profit, and this just reinforces that point. Your attempts to be more transparent and in tune with the community are futile, since at the end of the day it clearly doesn't matter what we think or how we feel. Most new players may not feel this way, but for those who have done mostly everything in eve, this was it man. What a shame..it was a good run, guess I will go give star citizen all my money now. Thx ccp, you finally killed eve. 
---
Isn't that a pvp fit though? I can kinda see why you want a web to slow down frigs but a scram?
---
/u/cactusjack48 is right
---
this just in, the majority of people flying in the AT wanted to fly in the AT and hopefully do well, as if it were some kind of tournament
---
but I guess since a majority of the playerbase (read: goons, I guess) doesn't want to waste development time on anything related to PVP that doesn't involve a supercap, we should just scrap the whole thing amirite
---
The saddest part about all this for me is that when Eve does eventually die, CCP will have nothing to show for it. It's not like they're running a cash grab so they can make a better game, they're just slowly killing content until eventually they're a company with no products or money.
---
About time. I have finally truly won Eve.
---
o7
---
iirc Fanfest was cancelled because they're renovating the building/complex they hold it in

Unfortunately, there's no group in EVE history that's ever held a successful tournament, or series of tournaments, with commentator and streaming support and well-made coverage.

Oh, wait.

I work, and have spoke to people that used to work at CCP before the CEO change, and they were very clear and echo'd the same information as each other. They don't care about the player base as much as they used to, and for a time, they really didn't care (there was a large drive to sell plex to make the game more attractive to potential buyers because revenue is based on plex numbers) and they made changes that would specifically increase plex numbers. They just stopped caring, and they had some horror stories of how bad the "behind the scenes" was for a long time, and probably still is...

So how much more of this garbage before we have another summer of rage?
---
I'm down to shoot the monument for a while.

Ah thanks. I also tried with blasters but Kristan is draining my capacitor and I could not fire them.
---
&gt; I think they are trying to figure out some new ~~PVE~~ lootbox mechanics
---
FTFY
---
I say we pick a wormhole with a HS static and hold a player or Eve-nt run tournament in there. Just have a hole control fleet keeping it locked down and doorstop the hole once you get the teams in. I’d volunteer for a hole control fleet for a tournament.
---
As long as people are autisticly injecting to get into overpowered capitals CCP will not balance them. Their intent is for their to be a massive discrepancy. 
---
Incorrect, they were interested in it for the dole payout.
---
My distaste for the AT begins and ends with the dole payout. Remove that, and you'll have my wholehearted support.
---
Games going to be dead before the next balance pass

Paging /u/ccp_falcon
---
That moment when globby is so highly upvoted lol.
---
Really shows how majorly CCP fucked this one up.
---
The problem is that most active pvpers aren't CCPs market. They've gone full f2p stupidity and are actively targetting only the whales. 
---
they released pink titan, I love CCP
---
I wager there have been months at CCP where more development time has gone into that report than ship/module balance
---
No ty. Don't need another PR bullshit post. Especially from him.
---
Not a bad idea. Hits the bottom line. Not gonna happen. 
---
Nah, lots of other great developers around. Just let the game die. RMT out what you can if that's really needed and let the game die out.

Newton's laws have already been kicked in the face, and had their lunch money stolen.

dont need to introduce a lot of new stuff, just make it so you cant inject beyond carrier 1, dread 1, capital ship 4, cap industrial 1

Where's the "no one cared since they removed betting anyway" crowd?

Insert eve is dead here ________________

Every time I try to have hope for this game, this shit happens.

Honestly, I can name the number of game companies I trust with the fingers on one hand...and have room to spare. It's the same shit everywhere 
---
"Dear esteemed cash cow we fuck:
---
We care solely and completely about your money, and nothing else motivates our top level decisions. Our best developers and our most passionate creators will either be fired or leave of their own volition as they can't do shit about our greed. We will update our game regularly, but only with monitization systems and practices rather then content. For what content we do add, it will be rushed out the door without a care in the world or a bug fix in sight. It will almost universally involve your money though, and things like SKINs will never be absent. 
---
We care deeply about "our" community, but not anything close to money though. So we've decided it's in your best interest to fire the community team, shut down your events, prevent you from running your own on thunderdome, and split fanfest up into a pile of miniature events. 
---
We are of course concerned about the numerous thousands of complaints you've made against our actions. Don't worry, we've assigned two interns to the problem every few weeks along with a locating slots of development time to occasionally rework things like the UI. While we value your feedback, we've also decided to sink massive development time into pointless events (that at your request we've gutted) and worthless in game tools that no one but week-old players use. 
---
Anyway, this note would be longer but we've fired the people who write them. But don't worry, just like the game lore our communication to you can be neglected for years on end without any negative impact or consequences. (Not to the game, to our bottom line of course)

Ta-ta,

---
it's not. youre dumb.
---
They basically quietly killed that plan and said nothing about it.
---
Lucky you my childhood had no internet yet and I played DOS games pre-windows era.

At this point i'll take anything i can get :(
---
Mfw there’s a game company with no actual game balance team 🤔
---
sure, send it all to Ramon Ahrire 
---
good point
---
Stop grinding. 
---
In an MMO. 
---
OK. 
---
Remember when CCP was going to have a dedicated balance team? I'm not even as big an AT fan as some people but, what, exactly are they spending their time on? I really hate "guess we need to dedicate more time to skins" comments but at this point what can I point to that balances (har) out that point of view? 
---
&gt;dino flair
---
heaven forbid a tournament actually have a prize other than vague appreciation right? and no, most people aren't just interested in the payout given how math works. a vast majority of people that enter the AT aren't going to make very much money, especially given the amount of time they put into it.
---
The conversion of this game to an economy simulator is complete. Goons have beaten Eve.
---
Thanks for that &lt;3 Most of us are around for exactly this sort of stuff, it’s great to see anyone take in interest in the lore &amp; I’m more than happy to help make it more accessible~

You'll often get these periods where it's taking like 10+ seconds to respond. Fine when it's pages, _reaaaaally annoying_ when its the autocomplete. I've kind of always assumed it was just requests queueing up considering it's completely fine (~200ms) when I check right now, but idk I ain't hating I just know how'd I'd built it from scratch today to avoid that. Then I look at the compute costs combined with the fact I'm shit at frontend and go "lmao nevermind".

I really feel you, for me too participating in the at was one of few things i still wanted to get off my eve bucket list, and i was really excited when we started seriously planning and it looked like we were gonna have a team going this year. Rip that now i guess

This would be a comical injection to goon wallets.

I didnt even notice. I made a second clock on my desktop for Eve time.

dinos have points?

wormholer btw?

Honnestly, my time is too valuable to risk on crap PVE with a history of being crap and bug ridden. I could be doing pvp.

CCP Mintchip?
---
Just wondering out loud, since it seems much of the tournament was player effort anyway, why not just get the larger corpse together and set up a tournament without CCP?  I know the Uni does/did their own, all the time; so....?
---
na not yet have come across em before and they are rough if your active tanked and not aligned. might give it a crack in the future thought.
---
Goons asking for no more cap skill injection and then make T2 caps plz CCP our stockpiles need to be used.
---
You'll get more mileage out of restricting the amount of skill points that can be injected per month, but of course CCP will eventually add an item to get around that for just abit. 
---
Yes! Jesus, I was pulling my hair out over that. Thanks kind stranger. 
---
Petition to run the alliance tournament through in-game groups instead. Don't let CCP take our fun away :(
---
yeah but advanced search :drooling_face:
---
Minchip.
---
Got famous for... interesting things.
---
That should have been CCP's slogan from the start.
---
They won't do that. They're afraid people will quit if they show a real schedule that doesn't include anything players care about.
---
I wasn't saying I didn't think it needed looked at. Just not a priority to them.
---
Wadu?
---
So the office with the highest salary costs per developer in PA's portfolio isn't being allowed to have its yearly party...
---
For some reason I'm not surprised.
---
Hah, okay, that sounds a bit nuts.  I mean, "dozens" seemed fine given that I thought they were supposed to have 20-30.
---
Who the fuck would inject mining alts to mine the event??
---
Yeah reading this as “we have no fucking clue what we’re going to be balancing so here’s this open ended statement to hopefully keep you subbed in hope of game imptovement”
---
zkill has it (mostly) you just need to do it manually
---
Wow, this is disappointing. I loved watching these. Makes no sense why they would remove such a great event. 
---
yeah, this sums up my feelings nicely good post 
---
good thing im already unsubbed lmao
---
Yeah and I'm agreeing with you.
---
Thank you CCP, very cool!
---
by interesting you mean, getting her tits out on the internet?
---
They could use a fusion or antimatter plant and call it good, but bomb-pumped lasers as a theoretical weapon in hard scifi are not new. The larger the bomb yield, the greater the power. Avatar DDs could easily be fusion bomb-pumped weapons and you could just make up how big the bombs are to fit your fictional frame.
---
yes i'm sure the one fucking tournament you ran all year (mostly with nerds who did it on unpaid weekend overtime) is the thorn in your back that prevents you from balancing the game lmao. this is why i never did or will give you any of my real cash. every time i think about buying a new toon or a plex pack you pull some real petty shit like this that makes me fucking hate ur guts and i don't do it out of spite. fuck you honestly
---
Can i get your stuff?
---
I wholeheartedly support your message, however I'm pretty sure there are enough dumb sheep out there who contribute to those revenue goal by licking up every singly NES skin that gets released, so I wouldn't bee too optimistic about fucking over CCP, it's a losing battle for the "good guys"...
---
Nope, its in Derilik.
---
You can't search for haulers that died carrying Meta 12 and above modules within 2 jumps of Jita between 1800 and 0200 though. Because that's the kind of advanced search I'm talking about. :P
---
It'll be a rorq mining contest.
---
And making ISK with it
---
Maybe they will have more success with their elite pvp small gang entossis warfare in SkillU. They showed everyone what experts they were when they took all those stations from Provi and defeated TEST to take all those faction forts... oh wait.
---
&gt;  They need to relocate to the EU for better access to top talent. 
---
This is an unfortunate truth. I know Icelanders are proud of their culture and amazing things they can do, but it's always going to be amateur-hour at the office if you're restricting your talent pool to people who want to live in a 350k population region that's a 3 hour flight from the rest of the world.
---
add me on origin ;) i hear u spam apex aswell ;DDD
---
things will stay the same as long as enough sheep buy NES skins, and enough sheep do... so whatever you say doesn't matter in the end... 
---
Go fuck yourself, CCP.
---
Ah, usually you see these screenshots taken from a hole that they all piled up in with no traffic, but I guess that describes a bunch of lowsec as well.
---
Honestly a public database with a API query (either graphQL or SQL) would be amazing.
---
My opinion is invalid. Ok, ditto to you
---
ThEy pUT AuTOcaNnoNs On An oGeR
---
I miss sentry drone domis. Can they maybe be unnerfed?
---
Yeah that was the last event I put any effort into participating in. I actually tried, ran a ton of sites and ended up with about 50 bpcs for accelerators and almost enough material (which was only seeded during that event) to build 2. And by that point they were so close to expiring that I didn't bother to build them.
---
Seems a fine move, skill is doing well content-wise by taking some crazy fights vs Legacy-lite
---
Oh damn son! I retract my comment. Also, you're a fooking nerd!
---
To be fair there are still 2 things left from that roadmap, the administration facility and propaganda structures, but yeah after that there's an empty void.
---
Its much more then that for a lot of people, it is at least a long term hobby, they become invested in both the game and the social aspects of it over many years. And CCP deserves everything they are getting for fucking up this badly. 
---
100% correct, is not worth it even for 1st place with the amount of time spent
---
Oh lawd, I forgot about that. The wave of white knights...
---
Just remembered CCP Dolan. Man what a trip down memory lane. 
---
can you make a zkill guide to rorquals please
---
no, i completely agree with you but what I mean is that CCP doesen't give a fuck because there are enough dumbasses who play this game like a barbie dress-up
---
Not sure if troll, but I’ll bite. Anywhere in nullsec that has low ships/capsules killed recently, anywhere that has sanshas rats (they tend to be the best), and if I have time to spare or know I won’t need my alt to cyno my main, I’ll go wormhole diving. If I’m doing wormholes in an astero I skip the ghost sites personally, and I have very fast hacking and scanning skills, just don’t want to blow my stuff up. Also wormholes so far tend to be the biggest gamble, I have much better and consistent results in null. 
---
im in that camp and i still dont think its cool act like that.
---
Excuse me! Mining IS fun.
---
Redhand linked me these kills but nice to actually get a story lmfao; amazing
---
Easily doable with a linear optimization tool
---
AT shit sucks but the chat system is literally fine now. In fact, I haven't experienced any issues at all since the bot slaughter a month back, and neither has anyone else I know.
---
Was fun while it lasted boys.
---
IIRC within the month it was announced lol
---
11/10 shitpost
---
300+ doesn't mean they're all useful lol
---
I don’t know if that’s based on facts though. Sounds like conjecture to me. You are basically saying ccp is supported pretty much 100% by whales. I don’t think I could agree with that without seeing a breakdown of their financials.
---
FC, what is a flair ruse?
---
Too soon? 
---
Everytime carriers launch fighters tidi drops to 10%. 
---
All the evidence points to you being 100% correct. The fact there is no communication from CCP on what is going internally is certainly telling as well as the lack of any concrete roadmaps or feature expansions.
---
This kind of stuff doesn't happen half as often anymore, there's really no reason to care about pvp now.
---
Yea it was a spectacular example of "there are no girls on the internet" rule and a terrible case of virtual oneitis to boot.
---
Calling r/gaming trash is an insult to trash.
---
r/gaming is a disgrace of a sub. Literally 100% of the content is some variation of "anyone else remember this game from 5 years ago", or "this game looks really good".
---
&gt;how can one company make the exact wrong decisions over and over again consistently
---
Don't worry I've watched this happen before, fuck you DayZ devs
---
Businesses aren't your friends, you don't need to look out for their feelings.
---
Seeing the same thing. Pretty awful. Probably not CCPs fault, but we might as well blame them because it's in style atm. 
---
and thus a meme is born....
---
Something I've always wanted to participate in. RIP
---
Honestly if the group can't live against a tiny number of wormholer cloaky boyes they should probably just be put out of their misery
---
Everything's totally fine guys.  Just keep your subs and buy injectors and we'll totally do balance patches.  BTW did you see the PLEX and SKIN sale?  We need to keep meeting goals so Hilmar can get a fat check from PA.
---
It's a very strong war vessel 
---
Anyone who is quitting due to this can contract me all there stuff k thx. Go focus on becoming good at another game already. We saw this coming a few years ago, last year was almost a clear indicator of things to come when they out sources the tourny. Sad to see it go tho, it was a fun thing to look forward each year. But not been able to get on the match's really hurt the viewership. 
---
+1 sir!
---
it's an economy simulator* 
---
Hardly much of a game anymore.
---
Everyone is un-subbing their accounts atm, please be patient.
---
There was a new sov system, Citadels and a complete Capital rework.
---
Not saying all of it turned out as i imagined, but they were rather big announcements. 
---
Fuck that, really?
---
Found it in Dotlan finally? 😱
---
CCP should be expected to follow their onetime adage. HTFU.
---
Goddamn Bap, I am at half mass reading that. Thanks for speaking for everyone else. Too bad CCP doesn't give a flying fuck.
---
Only yesterday I was asking our guys when should we start prepping for the AT. FOOLISH ME! 
---
Sad at the lost potential of the game. Happy its finally dying before it can be perverted further.
---
frig off rlihoad
---
&gt;Promises of future patches/content/tiericide (lol)/magic will not keep people playing. 
---
agreed - they cancelled one of the few consistent (and consistently good) things they do in order to make more promises that just seem hollow given their track record.
---
i only had good interactions with them, so good luck with the move. :)
---
Not like payout will be better anyways 
---
The number of services people like squizz and Chribba provide for free and are higher quality than the services we're paying for are amazing
---
They've done it before. "Hey, last AT cost us this in terms of time and money. Lets make sure to set that aside in our budget going forward."
---
Are you retarded? That forum post by definition is a combat/pvp update 
---
Who?
---
I assumed it was mining tournament 
---
I feel you as well. I've played for 12 years and this was going to be the first time we had a team in the AT. I'll probably never the get chance now as I don't trust CCP will bring it back next year.
---
What would make winning it rewarding other than actual rewards
---
Rorq Mining tournament. Who can mine the most ore before the timer runs out. 
---
CCP will then have NPC "dread bombs" appear and those who aren't asleep can panic and cyno in time will get bonus points.
---
Rorqual mining zkill guide 
---
Just turn the fucking server off now, they'd do us all a favour. 
---
I'll give you a marshal if you make a zkill guide about it
---
that's a monthly thing, i think it's abbreviated to 'the MER'
---
Demonstrating your PVP skill, of course. Otherwise, you're doing the thing simply to make the number go up. Isn't that what we call "PVE"?
---
Whatever happened to Tranquility vs Serenity? :(
---
more low effort than actually joining the alliance to begin with
---
\--- We’ll have more about that later, but for now it’s all about lying.---
---
I mean they have been doing that since 2003 so...
---
Then you should not play EVE. In fact, just stop it please.
---
Taking all those stations from Provi was indeed pretty good fun
---
I mean.. zkill’s open source already. You could try to implement it there? 
---
Gold for you. The AT announcement to me is the final straw, confirming fully that this game is an economy simulator that CCP will milk for as long as it lasts. There's no equalizer possible because it's no longer a game when skill can't counter a zerg.
---
What did y'all expect when pearl abyss bought the company? We all knew things were gonna change... We all hoped for the best. Others knew for the worse.
---
&gt; Nah, they're miffed  that the "useful" part of the launcher has a  comparatively small percentage of the screen real estate, meanwhile  adverts take up the rest. 
---
This isn't the case if you have a monitor in portrait view. ;)
---
The more *vertical* the launcher is, the more priority the "useful part" has. ;)
---
So, clearly, the answer to make people happy is to swap the positions: put the news items in vertical format on the left, and make the characters gigantic portraits you have to scroll through.
---
Oh wait, but then people with lots of accounts will be pissed because they have to scroll horizontally through dozens of pages of Headz.
---
You can't please everyone.
---
Until the pve experience is improved 1000x fold new player retention will be horrible. I tried to get some of my friends into eve and they just say the pve is too shitty.  The avg player expects fully voiced over immersive pve experience, that's equivalent to watching a movie.

It’s scientifically proven to be more effective quitting games when you have nothing left calling you back making it easy.

But I promise not a single one of you are really that butthurt over this to really walk away.   
---
I’ll happily post the contents of the contracts I receive!
---
see ya out there o7
---
I wouldn’t mind some “training only” skills to be introduced, but we do not need tech 2 caps in the game....
---
I too have had no issues with the chat system in months
---
today I learned that PVE means making a number go up, we really do learn something new every day
---
heaven forbid a sandbox game has more than one activity to participate in!
---
Imagine thinking a majority of AT pilots think they can actually win the AT
---
Anyone that isnt part of the like 4 teams that consistently place well do it for fun rather than profit, and a good deal of those who actually can win still fly for fun
---
no u
---
How much would it cost to run something like that?
---
how dare you play this game, where you're allowed to play however you like, how you like!
---
If they miss their revenue goals Pearl is going to be looking over those subscription numbers, hard. 
---
CCP is gonna be sweating their tits out when Pearl realise how many accounts are botters and alts alongside how much CCP over represented their player base for the sale. 
---
I'm surprised that's not a corp in goons already
---
For every fuck ccp post there is a "ccp are good plz gimme karma" post to follow.
---
They gave you loot boxes, what more motivation do you need?
---
great, thought provoking post. thx...
---
So the ECCM "Balance" that totally fucked up a lot of actual balance in the game and seemed like it was primarily done to fix the bullshit that happens in the AT was actually entirely pointless. 
---
That's actually not a terrible idea. 
---
So you create fleet content, requiring X number of players in fleet. These players are fleet warped to a deadspace zone with gates. They must collect the rare, mission specific ore in a limited amount of time while fending off stuff that you would find in abyssal space. Would require a few miners and a few combat ships, but it's up to the players to decide what to bring and how many. Max would be 10 people in site or so. 
---
Completing the mission would award loyalty points that could be spent on all manner of things, such as abyssal stuff, to other rare/unique awards. Would be very easy to implement. 
---
Fuck you CCP. 
---
This is actually disappointing to me, and I don’t even fly in these things.  
---
What is disappointing is that a lot of other players put tons and tons of effort into it.  Both flying in the tournament as well has broadcasting and doing commentary for it.  
---
That CCP can not support so many people’s gameplay while still doing the normal things to make the game playable is sadly telling.  
---
&gt; The life of the battle was, as Thomas Hobbes would say, “nasty, brutish and short”, lasting only 22 minutes.

oh please, ccp's been fucking shit up for long enough before getting bought out to dodge the full blame. THis is 100% on ccp, the one who acquired them are but a footnote so far.
---
Shit, I forgot to mention those. I guess that EA guy they hired is getting put to work.
---
CCP is playing a dangerous game with the EVE community, and so far they have only managed to continously piss everyone off.
---
If they really want to use game balance as their excuse for canceling the Alliance Tournament, they are going to need to buckle down and really show us some progress.. Or start losing a ton more subscribers..

Fool me once, shame on Amarr...
---
RIP the one thing i really loved
---
I feel ya. I've had a vague interest in playing in the AT but it's never been something I've actively worked towards. However some of my favorite memories from Eve were watching it while on comms and in chat with my friends/alliance mates and just absolutely nerding out over Eve played at the highest skill level. It's something unique to Eve I think, other games have pro-sports and Esports but nothing like the AT. Most of us know and fly with people who were in ATs, or have at some point. It's not people rooting for teams that represent their region but the players have very little connection, or rooting for teams that represent no one. The teams in the AT are our friends, we put them forward as our champions and we share in the spoils if they win. That's something totally unique I think and it's sad that it's dying.
---
Oh that sucks. I don't really play anymore but I enjoyed helping people practice for last year's AT.
---
&gt;  new players
---
nice joke
---
I'm not so sure. Isn't PA kinda bot and P2W friendly ? I don't see them as being against these sort of business tactics.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aq7eyv/psa_ccp_just_reimbursed_ships_lost_to_the_event_bs/ mean this?

Those Yulai skins were pretty amazing... but it doesn't *do* anything for the game. Just create another ISK sink most people don't participate in.
---
....Is EVE kill?
---
You tell 'em mate. It really is a slap in the face to the paying customers. Imagine WoW doing this or Star Citi- wait scratch the last one. Maybe they all meet and plot how to screw us over every year like a Gamerberg Group.
---
Indeed - sorry long day for me and didn’t bother checking. Just wanted to post something positive. 
---

I like and would do AT regardless of rewards. Honestly though it would be hard to justify the time and effort I put into it if there was absolutely 0 rewards. Its great to do something for fun, but its even better to get payed for it and have those rewards drive competition. Thats just the way people work. 
---
Either way that wasnt the context of that comment, we saw what CCPs confused answers to both AT happening and its reward do to peoples interest in putting in effort to make teams and organize. Last year they couldn't even get 64 teams where as the year before with decent announcement and communication they needed qualifiers because there were far too many teams, including teams bidding hundreds of billions of isk to get in. Theres clearly interest when CCP care enough to tell us about it. 
---
When it just sorta shows up barely in time to get a decent practice season and pretty much needing a pre-established team to make the deadline, its not a huge surprise people aren't as interested or even capable of putting a team together. 
---
If only it could have a low-sec gate...
---
Thats cool but people are still paying for their time. 
---
I'm sure CCP has some figures somewhere as to the number of accounts each person has... but if memory serves the average is about a couple, i'd be hard pressed to find the specific citation though. 
---
Oh thank god it's not just me, I was trying to figure it out for hours earlier.
---
IIRC, it was literally "1.5"
---
Than stop paying? Is someone holding a gun to your head?
---
Having never been a part of it I’m sad to see it go. I followed it like fans follow the NFL/NHL/MLBA/World Cup, etc. 
---
I always admired the individual skill it took to not just play this game but to play it at that level, geez. People have built their entire Eve gameplay around it. 
---
Pretty lame CCP. 
---
nope, not possible to even remotely compare to AT without Thunderdome
---
Ive been winning eve for a couple of years now. Every now and then i think about playing again but the game doesnt seem to be in a good place 
---
Yeah but I mean it's not like we really know what's going on between CCP and PA. It's entirely possible PA is limiting CCP's ability to Do Stuff by starving it of resources. Or, maybe the terms of the earnout are such that CCP's management is cutting costs in order to reach some profitability metric. There could be a lot of things going on, but certainly none of them seem very good for the players. The one thing they COULD do is communicate effectively, which they are not doing.
---
it happened
---
tq won 
---
that's why we have victorious yachts 
---
Then there'd be no problem with removing the prizes altogether?
---
Dear CCP,
---
for me AT is only place where there is fair fight in EVE, equal numbers on both sides, same points to spare, same rules, no batphone. Theorycrafters vs their counterparts, pilots versus pilots, fcs vs fcs ... friendships to be made during months of preparations ... theres no higher honor in EVE then to win the AT. You are taking away a chance for new people to win it.
---
Removing it is serious mistake that will have impact on wider area that just the tournament. Who do you think the tournament players are and what they are doing during the time outside the tournament? Could it be people that run EVE for you, like alliance/corp leaders, execs, fcs, content creators? In extreme cases like the PL AT team, this people run half the game for years and many still do in various ways. New leaders are emerging, and part of the culture of PVP alliances is to prove in the AT.
---
Instead of expanding abysall to 10v10 and building a leaderboard for minor and major tournament qualifications, you are removing this  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVPttmO8SO8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVPttmO8SO8)
---
I kinda see the "no fanfest" thing, when they need to cut expanses its a bit of an obvious choice. But no AT, even though I'm not a fan of it myself, I know a lot of people that are.
---
The biggest things IMHO are the content and update ones, the module and ship balance. Though I can see as to how and why they would put the module rebalancing and all that on hold, ***if*** there are big ship balance changes in the pipes then they should definetly do the modules after those, not before as things will change. But they aren't saying anything about it and I think that is the biggest problem. Let us know whats on hold, what has been scrapped, how things stand with the stuff that is being worked on. Some simple statements would do, doesn't have to be elaborate or give out too many details, just some basics.
---
Hi Chessur : )
---
&gt;If everyone wants an AT to happen
---
there's a difference between "wanting it to happen" and "wanting to make it happen".
---
That's a shame. I don't even play anymore, but I still followed fanfest and the AT every year. 
---
I'd never personally compete or even watch much of it, but this fact means I wont be returning to eve. If they shit on the best, then I have no reason to come back and (delusionally) try and become one of them. 
---
Oh I already did, my point being them restructuring isn't a good reason not to throw support out to the community. Even if they tried to make the community run more of the tournament and drag it out a little longer the fact that they just decided "nah its unimportant" is what sucks. As they had previously decided with a roadmap, dedicated community support staff, new content that isn't skins.
---
Unbelievable... I'm expceting some sota of response from CCP with this backlack from the community at the very least... 
---
Without pve guys we have no ships, we have no modules, we have no targets, we have no resources to fight over, we have no sov to care about, we have no services.
---
I don't pve. Ever, but without pve we have no game. 
---
IUnderstoodThatReference.gif
---
This. I'm ready for CCP to hang this game up on the wall. Call it done, quit drawing out the agony of the people that actually loved this game and had some semblance of hope for its future. 
---
Ya know, when CCP announced they were being sold to PA I was one of the people that thought 'just give them a chance, hopefully this will bring new eyes, new resources, and new content.' Yet here I sit with my foot in my mouth. Things have only gotten worse. 
---
They have never listened to feedback really.
---
I gotta be contrary as well, "you're fucking terrible" is kinda shitty to hear about people who are actually trying to do well beyond just having a job at CCP.
---
what a save!
---
chat disabled.
---
Boy I love false dichotomies, it's such a wonderful thing that there are literally no options physically possible between 'raging assholes' and 'bootlickers'.
---
Hint: when people call you out for being raging assholes, it's because you're being raging assholes, not because they think criticism of CCP is not allowed.
---
Yeah there is a lot of if's, But at this point I'd say we are too early in to see PA doing damage on this scale, They'd be watching right now and TBH are likely one of our best hopes of actually reversing this retarded decision as they do actually want a stable cash stream rather than killing it in one go.
---
&gt; Capital balance = people injecting enmass into carriers/rorquals/supers
---
It's "people injecting enmass into whatever ships are easiest and most reliable to abuse to obliterate anyone by exploiting home space advantage." Take caps away and people will reinject into next best thing and just keep on-duty bridgers rotating or something.
---
And, honestly, I'd rahter have carriers dropped on me and bail than bunch of Lokis with 4 sebo Arazu for tackle and lose my ship.
---
\+2 Sir!
---
Look, i agree it sucks and i was not trying to defend them.
---
It is just that CCP has been on such a path for a long time. I did quit around the (in)famous „Summer of Rage“ and since than have mostly been only lurking.
---
Even after that Event, they just altered their tactics and never gave up on their goal of profit maximization. Even at the cost of the game in one form or another.
---
CCP is taking community PR notes from Blizzard cause they had a record year in 2018...lol
---
A game that some of us have invested over 15 years of our lives in. Don't tell us to chill.
---
I think we are cross wired, i'm suggesting that balanced capitals from ccp perspective is caps being op so people spend money injecting. 
---
Oof!
---
I'm getting DUST PTSD. First come the lootboxes... Then the server shutdowns :(

I don't know about this gala event, but last year they would randomly warp away and re approach

---
So their initial explanation of "We're going to take these resources and dedicate them to a different part of the game" makes sense?
---
That's their argument. You may want them to stick to the AT, but arguing about where to distribute resources is very different from pretending the AT is some zero cost venture like Bap is doing.
---
2019 trend
---
Ok this is epic
---
Already too late to stop proliferation, please just make it easier to fight with the capitals we already have
---
We need reasons to keep investing time, effort and money into EVE. I've been here for almost 15 years now, I'm not bitching out of a desire to see the game die or anything.
---
I just want to know there's a course we're on. Continually saying "we'll have more info at a later date" is meaningless when that's every update.
---
sorry buddy but querns told me you're only in it for the money so the AT had to go
---
seriously though this is kinda the straw that broke the camel's back for me, I was able to kid myself before now that maybe CCP was just trying their best to sate two different gameplay styles but at this point it's obvious where they wanna go
---
EVE is kill...
---
Yes, of course there will be some outliers, people with 50+ accounts (gotta maximize on that input broadcasting) but IMO they could, and should, have pushed the launcher much more than they did, and made it a top-level overview of all of your accounts and characters, that's what I was aiming for when I mocked up https://notthelauncher.com/ 
---
Thanks Pearl Abyss.

you are that one dude who uses change.org aren't you?

why don't you do it then? need the fc to broadcast the link?

Hey CCP, hire me for minimum wage and I'll do the two hours of work it takes to make an AT ruleset LMAO 
---
They trully are the slavs of space. Poshlost(пошлост) means something bad in Bulgarian. 
---
Clearly not made by CCP.
---
Unfortunately that doesn't work anymore because all that will do is that the large krabbing blocs will simply ask their members to log and spam such a post drowning out everyone else and any changes that will go through will be ineffective and back to square one. Likewise with most of CSMs. To be honest the only single CSM I would trust for direct feedback to CCP is Suitonia (not sure spelling). All the other ones are just part of the problem and anything they offer to CCP will be skewed to promote more krabbing, more multiboxing, more botting or will be intended to minimize the impact of any actual good changes to themselves and their respective ilk. 
---
This is what got us into this situation in the 1st place, for example all the whining and bitching to give Rorquals a buff that took place, remember that ?
---
So its a mixed bag.  
---
Fucking clash of clans is gonna have a 1 mil tourney
---
&gt; Who the fuck would inject mining alts to mine the event??
---
Of course people would this is eve you should know better.. 
---
Honestly, literally what the fuck does the average CCP employee actually \*do\* on a given day given we've seen ZERO meaningful balance changes (ECM doesn't count) in like what over a year at least? What are you doing that's taking something that you can't have ONE person spend the literal hours (maybe a couple days???) to make up an AT ruleset. JFC.
---
This comment pretty much nails it.
---
The culture and gameplay that made eve different from other MMO's and kept it alive all these years is gone. The major groups are recruiting all the new players who want to make an effort to get out of high-sec and interact with others into mega-blobs. These mega-blobs have become so efficient and good at what they do that they will kill eve.
---
Intel channels, bots, super cap umbrellas, miners and ratters in ships that take 50+man fleets to kill, ship replacement programs, FCs that tell you exactly what buttons to press, alliance wallets that are essentially infinite. Meanwhile CCP neglects to make any changes to low-sec while adding things like bubble immunity, asset safety, rorquals, injectors.
---
 All the strategy and risk that made Eve different from themepark MMO's is nearly gone. Partly because of CCP and partly because anyone who doesn't want to be your standard null f1 pusher just quits since they are immediately pushed into the null f1 style without getting a chance to see anything else. 
---
I have been on this sub for about the past year or 2 trying to find a reason to resub and play again because i loved my time playing eve but  every time i open the sub it seems like CCP does something else to make sure i give my gaming money elsewhere
---
i realy want a pink skirt 
---
Sorry, who? 
---
Come to the worm holes.
---
You should check out the BDO (Black Desert Online) reddit sometimes. Its shocking how similar it is to r/eve in terms of post topics (bots, poor balance, shitty events).
---
Always enjoy a good AAR
---
Single index, single data object, log format, use Elasticsearch...
---
And ECM is slightly stronger, for all the good that does....
---
I do remember the whining/bitching about rorqs. I also remember all the people that said the changes they made to the rorq was rediculous and would crash the economy/market. But, i guess those people didn't have CSM representation at the time...
---
That's sorta my point. They can add all the skins they want but it doesn't do anything for the health or expansion/iteration of the game.
---
*hisses in Capsuleer*
---
Rifter is the size of a Boeing 737. One glider would probably be comparable to a light drone.
---
There's no harm in taking breaks, especially with Alpha accounts.
---
That said, they're not really giving us anything worth throwing money at them in anticipation.
---
Actually they would keep hiding them as these things have a tendency to snowball, this isn't the only game that has these issues there are plenty of games where a certain chunk of playerbase leaves and once the proverbial "shit hits the fan" that they have done so (the info made public) another huge chunk leaves with them.

Eve's engine uses DirectX. If they decide to re-make the engine to use Vulkan then yes.   
---
I doubt CCP will dump a few million dollars to make the client portable because the linux userbase is small.  
---
On the other hand they do support a mac client, so perhaps it would make sense to re-write the engine to get a lower overhead when developing features.
---
You can still do that, in fact you can have as many Rorq accounts as you want, log in, start them up and "accidentally" forget to turn off your ISBoxer. This is the current status quo.

You might not be wrong. I'm of the mind that enough caps dying daily could be a fun thing.

The Quality of Life improvements are great but we need some new stuff this year in 2019. 
---
And by killmark you’re talking about the final killing blow. Which, again, is not really a huge deal since those will be dominated by whoever generally has the best fittings and highest skills in a fleet. But he’s still in a fleet and the kill should be considered the fleet’s kill, not his own.

Hi! I'm a bit of a scrub when it comes to PvP, I like to consider myself an slightly-above-average line-member of an above average group. And I am surrounded by **really** awesome people *(Thanks EvE and thanks RC&amp;Friends)*
---
So it was my delight to actively engage in last years AT. It was a few weeks before my new job kicked off and I poured time into it, and even went to Nottingham for the finals.
---
The alliance tournament is such a fantastic event, and for me, it was more than just a few rounds of team on team combat, it was a chance to meet new people, a chance to see friends again, to do something different and get out of my zone. *(and blow Jin'taan's Avacado)*
---
For people watching too, it's such a staple event. Without the AT, what big EvE event is there anymore that isn't player generated? The AT is a part of EvE, to put it on hold just seems, very sad and dower. 
---
Please bring it back! 
---
That 'Team' is literally just /u/ccp_rise tho, so I feel a bit sorry given he also still probably has 1000 other things to do apart from balance (despite being 'dedicated' to it)

Just remove insurance from capitals completely. Or make it like faction and t2 ship insurance so you can insure it but you get very very little
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmJW59g6PuY - no more of this :/
---
You bring up some nice points. You could argue that a majority of the player-base doesn't use reddit or cares about the AT but I imagine a lot of important content creators might see this as the final straw.
---
Lol unironic eve is dying
---
I mean no, not at all. The final blow is often comically not the "best fitting and highest skill". Regardless think about a Titan, or a faction super, or an AT ship, or a Marshal, I want to know how much people have used these. People are generally pretty proud of killmarks.
---
I lost one yesterday if that helps
---
This guy pvps!
---
This sucks. Last year I got my first taste of the AT. The adrenaline and nervousness I had during the countdown to my first match was 10 times any fight I've had in EVE. I was pretty disappointed in my performances, but was determined to be better this year. It's funny we've had many great small gang fights and kills since the AT, but they all seem to be a bit bland.
---
 Not surprised, just dissapointed.. 
---
You're doing your part! Sign up now and join the Mobile Infantry.
---
They've been 'balancing' the game since 2003. The problem is there were so many poor design decisions made at the start, that actually fixing the game would require fundamental changes that could significantly alter gameplay. And then you have 15+ years of firefighting added on top of those bad decisions, and you arrive at where we are now. CCP just don't make good games.
---
Seriously CCP, this is just not on. You already got Eve_NT to do a huge amount of the effort; is it really too hard to support them to run an AT 17?
---
If you hadn't fired your community team, running community events wouldn't contend for resources with developing the game, would it?
---
Rip Scourge
---
There are more alliances that die than alliances created 
---
I feel you, but as important as capital balance is to the community, taking a year off for a solid balance pass seems like a good idea. Maybe the community can set up their own tourney? 
---
I have never wanted to unsub more guess we finally see the dark side of the merger 😔
---
Can you link the response please?
---
Alternately, trash them on stream.
---
This was the year i would have actually tried to get in the AT team. Sharing the sentiment.
---
aye, concerns about EVE's....current state keep stacking.  and this canceling of the AT really adds alot of weight to the "EVE is not stable" side.
---
prior to the announcement i was nervous but confident about eve's shakey state as a state of transition.
---
now....wondering if we at the edge of a freefall
---
https://forums.eveonline.com/t/alliance-tournament-xvii-an-update/139758/37?u=blazigen
---
Thanks
---
For sure, but I think that is just more attributable to the level of difficulty associated with running an alliance. It is really hard to set one up, and then having the infrastructure and support to have long term success is an entirely different beast. If you took the top 100 alliances in EVE over the past 3 years and looked at it, there is a decent level of churn there. It is to be expected for one reason or another.
---
The rate is currently 1000 : 2 at 100% reprocessing rate. One site gives you 3 chromo pieces at 75% rate.
---
The sites don't seem to be spawning either. Not seen a VIP site all day.
---
I mean it's never really been the same since the community team was let go. It's a shame really because even though I'd never have aspirations of flying in it, the AT was always fun to watch. 
---
I hope this is decision that CCP is listening to us on and will take a large step back based on the various threads to try and put something together or make plans to course correct for next year. 
---
I've only seen 1 all day in null sec.
---
You are definitely right that majority of the player base don't use Reddit or care about AT, but the biggest game shaker's (content creators) definitely do.
---
Even if I take your comments at face value it doesn’t change the fact that they are catering to that type of gamer. FYI my comment wasn’t a directive but rather an observation. 
---
&gt; GoTG forces responded to try and save the tackled Rorqual, forming a Munnin fleet of their own. [...] The fight lasted about 25 minutes, with over 20b ISK lost. 19B ISK of that was lost by GoTG between the value or the Rorqual and the defense fleet brought in an attempt to save it.

I would like to know more!!
---
If I was gonna do it right I'd budget about $80-100/month minimum with about $100 of setup fees.
---
It'll be a VR tennis tournament in stations.
---
where did they confirm keeping the bad chat?
---
No, stop that, you are showing why it is so confusing to be a developer listening to the community. The amount of flip flopping that goes on in this sub is fucking stupid.
---
Citadels come along and it's all "CCP stop adding new shit and fix your broken game", now it's the opposite? I want tiericide, I want balance passes, I want QoL, if we have to go a year without Jesus features then I don't give a fuck, I'm not here for that shit I'm here to shoot other spaceships, I'll work with what I have for everything else.
---
im glad i stopped playing when i did
---
Not all alliances use capitals every day. I'm sure that eve players would riot if they didn't get to control who can take control of their fighters. Most would probably restrict it to alliance members only. You don't want some random controlling (and going afk) your fighters when you drop a carrier solo into a small fight.
---
I’m in the same boat. First Corp I joined was a mission running Corp and it was actually really fun. Doing L4s together I was in a hurricane and they ofc had battleships. Then we got decced by this merc who had neutral logi scouts and a Navy Meg that was bricked tanked. 
---
One by one they quit and fortunately for me I joined a faction warfare corp which opened up a new part of the game but for about two months I didn’t play just trained skills. I never saw those guys log on again after about a month. RIP the Venomous Six 
---
In order to prevent unfair advantages, we have decided to make AT ships available to ALL players!  Get them or one of many other ships now from our new lootboxes available in the New Eden Store!
---
idk, the company I work for was bought out by a VC firm last month, and 3 weeks later 15% of global staff (incl. an entire layer of management) were fired.
---
Shades of The Last Jedi going on here. "TELL US THAT WE HAVE A PLAN".
---
The war dec will always be trash as long as neutral logi and boosting is allowed.
---
You think that the only people pissed about this are the ones that managed to get to the top 4?
---
If the final blow isn’t any of those things, then why would it be meaningful? Why is it interesting to know how many times someone lucked into the killing blow?
---
Of course people would be proud of a killing blow on a titan, but realistically their contribution is likely not much more significant than the hundreds of people involved in helping make that happen.
---
Party for Goons? When? Why was I not there? 
---
Besides, according to SirMolle, Goons died long ago.
---
That would be too much like investing in Eve and would have diverted resources from more important projects... like werewolves, VR etc.
---
&gt; chat "fixes"   
---
&gt; we're on maintenance mode 
---
You'd wish! If they were actually spending time to improve game quality, that would make a difference.
---
Also, they've stopped making original skins and have started importing from Serenity... talk about taking a break!
---
terrible format. content 10/10.
---
Well we jave something else to be nostalgic about. RIP sweet AT
---
ah stop winging
---
If someone is leaving.. I think they would prefer a golden good bye.
---
Tbh since CCP doesn't care about the game support services should shut themselves down too imo
---
^🎺 ^^^🎺 ^^🎺 🎺 🎺
---
for a decent responsiveness, I suspect, quite a lot. At least if it were for all time.
---
If it were only the last month, probably not too bad.
---
good ur videos are fuckin gay anyway lmao
---
No, but they’re the only ones who have ships that I want to ask to keep in the game. I’m pissed about this too. I don’t have a limited edition ship in my hangar which would be lost forever were I to biomass or leave. 
---
I thought a lot of the content was in getting to objectives, flying a titan, making a clan, taking over all of nullsec etc
---
They might as well split the year into seasons and apply random mutators to ship/ammo stats at the start of each season - "balancing" becomes a scheduled script.
---
Always have to be careful what you expose and how. Because if you make it too open, it's really not hard for someone to craft a few queries which would bring it to its knees. Especially with SQL.
---
Probably. But a lot of these guys have multiple AT ships. 
---
With regards to that "WinterCo" fight. that 91bil underestimates the losses. Keep in mind there were 2 timers. Armor and Structure. This figure only accounts for the latter. WinterCo lost 50bil on the armor timer [https://br.inyour.space/?s=688&amp;b=8466960&amp;e=90&amp;t=bfuv](https://br.inyour.space/?s=688&amp;b=8466960&amp;e=90&amp;t=bfuv) which makes the total isk cost of that athanor 110bil in winterco isk.

CCP was purchased for $425m last year by a company based in the East. China is definitely a huge revenue stream for CCP and I think PA is definitly going to help them in this area. Despite the cancellation of AT, I'll remain hopefuly that we'll see some major improvements within the next 3-6 months. Stomping your feet and unsubbing is a knee jerk reaction and I don't disagree with your decision, but hopefully CCP proves to us why they did this and all 27 of you decide to return.
---
Legit how hard is it to just give EVE_NT full AT control? Seems like that would've been a better thought process than causing 300 players to unsub : )
---
A corporation should exist to make their members richer, not the other way round.
---
Rogue drones was pretty good but this event is utter garbage. I don't mind the sites being a challenge but they are rare as fuck and the loot is non-existent.
---
We've had the NCPL sucking each other off comment, we've hit P3AK (lol) AT. They gotta quit while they're ahead.
---
Absolutely right. I don't get to see all the timers so the only way I know about it is when you guys share it with us in our discord in our #intel channel. I try my best to cover everything, so it only works when I have more information at my fingertips to work with. 
---
So they break something... then put it back and we're thank-posting them? lol Why the hell would we thank them for that? Brb gonna do "congrats, you didn't break anything for 24 hours" and other things that should be expected. 
---
I kind of agree. I'm less upset about no AT than I am at not being up front about it. It's a cool spectacle event, if they cant do it for whatever reason they should just say so.
---
&gt; I kinda see the "no fanfest" thing,
---
From what I heard, HARPA is being rennovated or something, so they literally don't have a venue big enough to host the event in Iceland right now.

6 months shy of 10years of EVE, started August 09.
---
And now we have bean-counters (accountants) ruining (running)  EVE / CCP. So perhaps it’s time to say “thank you for the fish” and unsubscribe.  You a right on levels, - the master quarters in stations and the monicle, also the laggy game we had for months after. Citadels... where to start.., they are killing my interest in EVE. And now no AT
---
As someone who's been in and around VC my whole adult life, both those cuts were planned as "synergies" mainly supports, and that layer of management that I'd bet never really did much anyway. 
---
I really, really don't think PA is doing this. It is/was CCP, they're trying to cut expenses for their earn out, and nothing more. The worst thing you could do is cut your marketing after agreeing to such a purchase. Add in events that are loss leaders, but put EVEs name out there, such as FanFest and the AT (I watched both before ever touching EVE.) I don't see why PA would stand for this. Were it up to me, I would've stepped in already. They are honestly setting up EVE to fail without both loyalty and what growth they can get. 
---
He is still alive lol, hope to see a vid before the closure of New Eden 
---
Yeah true. I just think that a lot of this was coming prior to the acquisition or at least shortly after it happened. 
---
The Level of interference from PA *Should* be small, But it is a possibility.
---
What party? Is that some reference to the csm because it's full of goons?
---
Yeah I saw your thingy. Nice mockup. Personally, I don't like it. I like a list view for chars :3

But can you wait to see what happens on the next event as it follows the current trends ?
---
Let's be realistic here 99% of eve players don't give a fuck about at
---
Not many times have I felt the sensation of utter defeat. Especially not when it comes to video games. But this news has just hit me like a freight train. I am feeling utterly defeated. And seriously trying to cope with the fact that ccp seems to become more incompetent by the minute and keeps showing utter disregard for their community. 
---
They'll be back after they finish tiericide
---
Breaking: Goons killed the AT
---
Oh yeah, I get all of that and fully understand the rationale. I was responding to the notion that PA wouldn't be forcing changes soon after a purchase went through - that's not necessarily true at all.
---
I understand that but sometimes the vocal minority can be a bit much. 1st world problems people.
---
This vid is unironically amazing, and well-edited as well. Seeing people meme around makes me happy, something I sorely needed after today's AT announcement ♡
---
Most players don't care about the at nor do most players attend or even want to attend fanfest. In fact, fanfest isn't why anyone plays this game
---
Okay, where did those resources go to? There have been only ~5 balance passes the entire year, and the skins they're releasing were already on the Chinese server.
---
I'd rather grind sites for 5 hours in a VNI while playing Apex on another monitor... 
---
No they aren’t. That’s why I unsubbed 7 accounts. Fuck them.
---
If PA were truly "interfering" (how do you interfere with something you own?), they would have replaced all senior management and placed their own people in charge. That hasn't happened (yet).
---
This is a good thing, the AT is emblematic of a good chunk of what is wrong with Eve Online. Let's hope it stays dead.
---
lol i use reddit and still dont care. sucks for those who liked that crap but well....
---
Use DXVK. It's pretty great.
---
They killed ths game some while ago
---
\+10....and fuck u ccp for deleting pvp content from game with ur stupid rorquals and super proliferation
---
I've heard the same from suitonia, but nevertheless Harpa (which is relatively new building, so idk why would it be renovated) hosts various of events according to its site (https://en.harpa.is/events/), so I really doubt it is true.
---
"Cost equivalent of Palatine Keepstar or higher" so the thing that is essentially impossible to build and not even remotely worth is by an exponential amount. This might be one of the worst ideas I have seen on reddit so far. Bravo
---
I think they're going to be pretty busy with the world tour thing. 
---
Would be worth the temp ban
---
Unpopular opinion - I like Eve and flying spaceships, but don't have a lot of time to play lately. I would love a faster way to get into fights. Even when I tried FW it was a lot of flying around for 2 minutes of fun. They should implement some kind of high sec death match arena/tournament, perhaps with queuing and match making.
---
Interesting point of view. Can you elaborate?
---
Hi, thanks for the set up, are you sure on the Pith Large, as when I run it through pyfa it take le cap into the red (nearly all skills at 5) and no guns in the top slots? 
---
Billions of tons of ore mined daily!
---
Yeah you think you'd combine ECM of "you can only shoot me now!!!" with increased damage mitigation/absorption...
---
You know, considering you're obligating your target to only attack you... lmao
---
IMO, as soon as you take a part of Eve out of the sandbox, you hurt the rest of it. There are groups that barely have a presence on TQ that we're supposed to admire based on their alleged prowess in instanced PvP. The whole thing just leaves me cold. 
---
Make an API endpoint for each query your FE needs. FE queries the API using relevant parameters and gets JSON to construct the view. SQL is good for exploration and analytics, but if you know what you need, use something else i.e. NoSQL.
---
Not really anymore. :( 
---
Lots of RMT potential for someone actually quitting for good, buddy. Not gonna happen.
---
Yeah but after 8 hours the wrecks despawn. It was a bit like those films you see of bears catching salmon in Alaska. Boom and bust. Now you're back to just the occasional fail.
---
How long until the Galaxy Pack goes on sale again? :P
---
I mean, at least with the falcon you can flip people off from outside effective range. Sometimes.
---
Good post. In addition, by forgetting the small gang solo low sec type play style they have effectively destroyed the natural progression into null. Sure some people want to start playing eve and go straight to nullsec but there are many others who want a slower progression. This means learning the ropes in high sec, tuning them in low sec , then potentially joining null. This bridge is now simply missing as there is little to no content in low sec. I miss the static plex days where local low sec groups would fight over DED systems in molden heath. I think these types of system are needed to concentrate a dwindling number of people who like small gang play style. If I have to log on and spend hours looking for anomalies and the like just so I can buy a couple of cynabals or whatever I may as well mine, and I don't like mining so rather not log on. I used to buy like 6 plex and that together with a few DEDs would last me a years worth of ship losses ( I PvPd for the upscale kills not the overall stats on a killboard) now I just can't be arsed.
---
I used to be able to find 10hrs a week to play eve. If I have to spend 70% of that time finding a bit of ISK to fund my imminent loss, then an extra 28% of my time looking for a small gang / target then I just cant be fooked.
---
I stopped playing about a year ago after 5years. Was looking forward to watching the AT, now that is also down the shitter.
---
The last time i heavily participated in any of these events was the blood raider event over halloween. I spent hours clearing sites, mining out the belts, rinse &amp; repeat. The compressed values for the ore was terrible. The BPC drops werent great. 
---
I haven't had the interest since to really do these where normally I'd be all over it griding multiple accounts at once. 
---
Generally, you make them yourself.
---
Once upon a time, explorers could scan down NPC battlefields that just had random wreckage to loot and salvage. But then they got rid of those.
---
Now, you can't really make a living **just** by salvaging unless you team up with someone responsible for making the wrecks. Either a mission runner, or a PvP fleet. Following along behind them cleaning up the wrecks they leave in their wake. 
---
How can a group of developers be so disconnected from their base?

---
Quick update on the Legacy vs Skillu front as you seem to be getting very one sided intel.
---
Y-F ihub died today together with 3 Skillu structures in that system. They've been losing more structures for the past week, some under Skillu tag, some under alt corps. Conflict seems to be dying down as Scourge disbanded now and Skillu stopped showing up for any timers, even those that are contested by relatively small, single alliance fleets.
---
Everyone on Reddit continues to cry about CCP’s actions like their voice matters. 
---
You are all worse than magic players bitching about WoTC
---
CCP/PA is a business, one that has decades of being successful. They aren’t going to make moves that are going to cost them money. 
---
Similar to WoTC, they have begun aiming towards gathering “casual” players. Whether you like it or not, “casual” players probably make up 60-70%+ of money spent on EVE as well as unique logins. The entire gaming industry is switching over to “casual” gameplay. 
---
EVE means something different to everyone, and has many different play styles. I’m sorry, but I’ve played EVE for over a year and the only mention I personally ever heard of the AT was when TiS mentioned Fort Knocks probably had some AT ships in them. Had I not been a TiS listener(which most casual players probably aren’t) I’d have no clue what y’all are bitching about. 
---
While you may have no confidence in the direction they are heading, you can uninstall EVE and I’m pretty confident CCP has calculated they will do just fine without you. 
---
I thin kthey need to pack it in and turn over the source code to the playerbase.  
---
who's with me on this...
---
That's the easy way to explain it to kids. They get it pretty quick.  
---
This opinion may be unpopular... But I think this game needs a loot-sharing system for groups of players.
---
This game where stealing/backstabbing are all but encouraged, above all others.... needs some loot sharing in its universe.
---
Incursions might just a tiny bit less boring if there were some juicy drops at the end that were randomly divided up amongst the fleet. 
---
Huge QoL improvement that would promote people grouping for public fleets like these Gala events, or 3-man frigate abyssals for example. 
---
/opinion
---
I participated in a lot of ISD events. They have been gone for ages. But holy fuck were they fun and storyline awesome.
---
We've been asking for it for probably half a decade or more... it's another sacred cow they refuse to put to death.
---
Abyssal PVP was a start, but putting it behind some nonsense PVE showed cowardice. 
---
War with my enemies is a pretty damn good reason to keep playing. Oh and it’s the reason I play this game in the first place.
---
No, They couldn't have replaced people yet, Most buyouts like the one PA did, Contain clauses that stop you from just entirely canning the old management team for so many years.
---
The Sp threshold is too high for newbies. This is not playable as a newb, which is part of the issue here as the initial ones were.
---
Good point tbh.
---
Earlier this week.
---
The bad chat has certainly been better in the past two weeks or so though.

It's nothing like it was in November/December.

At the very least, you ought to know who Pandemic Legion is. They’ve been one of the major players in this game for a very long time.
---
But yeah as for the other two it’s basically just “uh what”
---
AT isn't worth it if they wont make AT prize ships. 
---
Yes, and CCP cattering to the vocal majority of players and the mindless nullsec swarms has clearly lead to a great state of the game and unparamount trust by the playerbase on their company.
---
Lol obviously not.
---
Honestly the AT was one of the reasons why I could stick eve on the tv, get excited by stuff (honestly mostly a HS carebear when I do re-sub) ... commentary was great ... got to explain stuff (she would never play eve, not her jam) but was something we could watch, place bets against (no rmt ofc) and drink while watching ... this makes me super sad (relationship agreement, she (or we) gets to watch world cup, I get to watch internet spaceships (and we do))
---
Skill urself and Scourge. formed up approximately 260 people in Nightmares with Minokawa FAX support as well as a Munnin support fleet and a bomber wing. 
---
This is wrong, check the battle report and you'll find that the munin fleet was the same dudes in nightmares that refit for munins later for a Entosis timer (which we won against triple the numbers again)
---
I always thought the level of pilot and FC skill, the strategy in fleet comps and tactics, and the amount of isk people were willing to put on the line made for incredibly compelling viewing. Yes, the individual matches were a sandbox, but the resources and work leading up to those matches were fully part of the in game universe.
---
Not as unpopular as you think, but then you get all those multiboxers that will log onto all their alts to shoot it down and a few other groups. I would have liked something like this as well.
---
Mainly just the isk betting .... I miss it so.
---
Make our own?
---
brb calling my texas lawyer
---
Well, I just lived through exactly that. All C-suite execs were canned, as well as a layer of management, many of whom had been in the company for a decade or more.
---
We should dedicate one system as the "fly here for guaranteed fights", and spread the word. Make it the Thunderdome System.
---
CCP clearly has too many customers.
---
I'd like to play EVE, but one day they decided suddenly that my email (that worked fine with them for a decade) is no longer acceptable.
---
First the said they would fix it. But after 2 tickets that got closed without fixing this I gave up. Weird business.
---
The tournament was actually what brought me back after several years away from the game. Real sad to see this, and I hope it’s not for good. 
---
You also have to wonder if this is a decision made by the new owners...
---
I can only report what I get passed onto my desk and what I can find. Our reports are not perfect by any stretch, they try to capture as much as possible by the time of writing. But I encourage you to join our discord and share important info so we don't miss it in future iterations. 
---
It's pretty mind boggling, because I'm not sure I understand the logic behind it.  
---
Once the games loses enough players it will start dropping, as an empty eve is a boring eve.  Without players to plex, inject and sub, where are they going to make money?  
---
Sure! Give me an offer for my Chremoas.
---
God forbid the game stay as-is for a few months...
---
i've always had a dream of a NPSI "fight club" but never actually been motivated enough to start it.
---
huh, where are you based ?
---
I don't know what happened in your case, But I know CCP had statements and a clause to stop it happening for x number of years.

That's some dumbo spin easily proven wrong you've got there buddy. Which small single alliance fleets would those be ? Not to mention you seem to fail to realize that while you form 325, 399, 376 on the last 3 citadels (not counting test forming and standing down when we didn't come) we've been killing your rorqs bag the same time.
---
But falcon said not to worry! He said they were gonna be 'transparent' in that post that told us nothing! 
---
but it will be a lot of cool things just you wait and see
---
*silence*
---
Eve ships even travelling at the basic 3 au_s are still traveling at like warp 8ish
---
The stopped forming for any fights recently. :(
---
That's not what the arguement here is. I didn't say "we need sweeping changes now", I said "we need to know what's in store for us". 
---
So far, it's fucking nothing worth writing Jita about.
---
Putting my app in now. Party time.
---
Really? I have like 5 accounts on one email. :(
---
ahahahahahaha love it
---
I agree with you this is classic CCP. It reminds be a lot of the summer of rage where the player base was so frustrated with the lack of progress and short sited monetary goals.
---
Most management were based in the US - I'm working in one of the euro offices.
---
Oh god, you think there's spaghetti now!
---
This makes me sad. I quit playing a few years ago because of life but I made sure to neatly pack up my stuff with the intention of jumping back in. Seeing this and some of the other recent stuff and it doesn't seem like there will be anything to go back to. 
---
Wolves need sheep to survive.
---
Uh oh, someone who doesn't think voicing their opinion works. Better just never say anything then.
---
If you think this is trolling, you need to pull your head out of your ass and harden the fuck up. There are other play styles besides yours.
---
Who the fuck are you to tell me how to voice my opinion? Somehow, your yearish is "more important" than someone who has been playing for 15+ years? It's about fucking equal you sanctimonious prick.
---
Its funny.... He says hiatus to make it better... but its gonna make it worse. A lot of dedicated AT players that make the AT great are now quitting because of this. Which will make the next one less interesting.  
---
They are 95% likely just canceling it and promising another one because they dont want accounts still training for it to unsub. 
---
i cant believe ccp laid off 800 employee's! :\*(
---
Eve gameplay is currently: undock, attack, watch cyno light and bpops/caps appear, explode. So tbh, the rng element would add some spice to the game.
---
Sounds like you need to skill for a Golem. Salvage, tractor and shoot simultaneously.
---
No shit. We go to fanfest *because* we play this game.
---
Yeah I apologize about that bud. Just bad wording on my side when we were trying to talk about the two different objectives. 
---
Good point. Forgot about that bit. I mean some of them are cool but jesus christ.
---
Insert skinner meme.
---
Yes, I've been watching Shadoo videos all afternoon. 
---
Your flair makes your "uh what" a bit ironic. Evictus is Legacy's F team rofl.
---
Back before interdiction nullified intys, null sec entrences were bustling with activity and easy to find content. Now they are a depressing wastland compared to their former selves.
---
That literally means you get ONE bloddy fancy pants mineral per site,   
---
wich means you need to mine out Three to FIVE sites (each get you ~1500+) to be able to buy one of those stupid chests wich give you Literal garbage 
---
GREAT 
---
You say that but the entire AT last year was run with volunteers.
---
You can use combat probes to probe down mission runners, warp to their site and ninja-salvage their wrecks.
---
You realize that the sub is not one big blob, and there are *thousands* of different voices?
---
Nobody said that. Don't put words in my mouth. I said that I want to know what their big plans are. They're not holding Fanfest so all the announcements that would normally come out of that have to happen somewhere else. Are they just going to throw out random shit through the year? Are they going to announce stuff at the random "fanfests" around the globe?
---
We don't know, and the uncertainly is worrying.
---
Booked through April, well I'll be damned.
---
They could have mentioned that so we're not sperging out thinking they're just *not* doing it.
---
throw caution to the wind, LET THE SHITTOCANE BLOW
---
Roadmaps are only good if they lead somewhere. Dead ends aren't considered a destination.
---
Just because I know who skillu is doesn’t mean I expect everyone else to. That would make me arrogant.
---
Come on now, you say the AT post!  Balance is now number one!
---
Hilmar is probably thinking of retiring and wants to get as much cash as possible before it all falls down.
---
I think that means Legacy minus Test.
---
I guess it's time to shoot the monument again
---
Goal-posts-Harvey.
---
Wow what the fuck, I'm kinda glad I'm winning eve
---
So what happens to the monument after the EVE servers shut down? Will they tear it down? How long will it sit there before people say "wasn't that monument for some shitty space ship game? Why is it still here?"

---
Evictus killed it with 50 feroxes today with XIX and some other individuals showing up to "whore" at the end. It doesn't count cause you put it in an alt corp?
---
Then Y-F ihub - you couldn't even form for it. Then a bunch of other structures in Y-F and around. Skillu always trying to form, getting 60-70 guys and then standing down.
---
And if you wanna gloat over some spodbrain killmails, look at your Frat friends rorquals that Legacy was dunking recently.
---
I mean, it's no surprise.   CCP has been toilet bowl spinning for years now, then they were bought by PA which is total cancer, and they've pissed a ridiculous sum of money away into failed projects.
---
Considering Nova marks their what, 7th failure in a row?   Figured it was about time for even more cuts.
---
But hey, they'll continue to throw out broken events a testbed to paid lootboxes.
---
You would be correct, if the losses weren't real.
---
just goes to show what kind of assholes wardeccing corps are :p
---
yeah, i quit a few weeks back. Abyssal site bugged the fuck out and i lost 4bil in ship and pod. I submitted a support ticket and  they were like, sorry, not a bug you couldn't control your ship or shoot anything. So imma take my subscription and go play a game that actually works.
---
I desperately hope you are right. However the lack of any progress the last 6 months is very distressing.
---
Cap alliance size and blue lists  
---
Delete renter alliances  
---
Increase Sov holding cost per system
---
Leave your blobs
---
well, guess i'm one step closer to just RMTing all i've got and leaving the game eh
---
SMA?
---
:img-timeline:
---
Cheers, will look into doing that.
---
As fucking bullshit ridiculous as it sounds this is probably an accurate statement
---
I mean balance passing is so last century, if you're spending a fuck ton of resources tweaking a few base stats here and there no wonder it is so out of kilter.  With all the cheap ton of data available from killboards and market volumes just write an algorithm that auto balances every month or so. Leave it up to the players to find what's changed and what works and it will be an evolving thing if beauty. Then, if it all craps up after 6 months then just reset the stats and turn the algorithm off.
---
Tweaking numbers doesn't cut the mustard. 
---
But they made a little website in 5 minutes that shows progress bars!  JESUS BE PRAISED, WE SAVED YO
---
Everyone giving CCP a hard time should aim it at P.A.
---
CCP gutted it's staff a few years back and it's never been the same. 
---
If they cant monetize the AT you bet your butt it's not coming back. PA won't let them as much as the skeleton crew left at CCP would tell you they don't control em. 
---
That was possibly the funniest e sport comment I had ever heard. 
---
No reason?  Like 7 utter failures of game development sound like a reason!
---
To each their own and godspeed! o7
---
Lmao are you gonna compare your own alliance members to frat and us ? Pathetic that you even think evictus could do shit and that those on that kill only showed up to whore and weren't formed for it beforehand
---
It actually kind of amazes me how many people still believe CCP's word, when they've shown for a couple years now that it is absolutely no good.
---
Lmfao dead game
---
I used to install that on my college roommate's computer.  It was absurd.
---
We were ready to defend you the entire time. If you are going to shittalk our enemy please at least be accurate. 
---
bonzibuddy is an advanced AI(artificial intelligence), that runs natively on windows XP (the same OS that runs the eve servers)

---
To be fair, the couple hours a year on AT is more time than these fucktards spend balancing the game.  
---
No, random 25 m3 drone bay or -5 M/S here and there is not game balance.
---
in the few times i dealt with customer support the interactions were usually as follows:
---
A pretty quick response within about 24 hours or so "Your ticket was received we're looking into the issue", the standard shit followed by weeks of radio silence sometimes having your ticket redirected to multiple different "departments" and the timer counter from "previous action on the ticket" or whatever that thing is getting reset.

I had this playlist of some of our POVs of the matches we played in AT 15 and 16 and figured I'd post it with the announcement that the AT is cancelled this year (and probably forever, knowing CCP).

---
Well well well, seems like some people are starting to wake up to the horrible reality... There's nothing there CCP is milking you like cows, just let them rot...
---
I agree with you that at this point it's just sad. There's so much lost potential with EVE that will never be realized. I don't see any chance of a significant amount of resources going into making large content expansions at this point. Such a sad fate for a great and unique game.
---
Rofl, with Pearl Assbyss owning things, its 99.99% more likely to get worse before it gets better.  What we're seeing now is likely the agreed upon time for CCP to meet player metrics on their own before Pearl Daddybyss takes over and fully monetizes it when they fail.
---
In a more sentimental side of things (after venting in a couple of posts and Discord), the AT is what got me interested in the game besides the sandbox concept, what made me come back to the EVE several times, and what gave me some of my best moments and friends in this game.
---
Right in the feels.
---
Yeah they are but I'm sure they won't be happy when it turns out their new purchase of 30k players peak turns out really to be 12k players peak padded with bots and alts.
---
If you want to see two faced check out CCP security round tables and youtube casts online. ''If you RMT you are scum &amp; we will ban you for stealing from us. Botting problems? Yeah we might look into that theft from our player base, sometime, maybe.''.
---
I still don’t understand how one can aid in battle and not he flagged as a combatant 
---
Thank you for this :)
---
We could also buff blops content (revert ecm changes for fighters, buff blops bs, nerf panic, maybe nerf fax)
---
Or we could try to rebalance sovwar so wars involve more regular fights (instead of "circle each other hissing for 2 months before maybe getting a super throwdown but probably one side just admits they're outnumbered and leaves")
---
Or we could try implementing that resource scarcity idea, although the last time we made a radical change based on reddit outcries we got patchwork eve/fozziesov which isn't exactly what people wanted, so idk
---
Like there's a lot of ways CCP could make it easier to play eve if you aren't a rorq miner, right now every change makes it actively more difficult for people who undock pvp ships (except to drop supers on roaming gangs). People still like to play this game &amp; some of us find it really fun to hunt krabs, so it's not going away terribly soon, but I'm not happy with the direction lately.
---
Also, you commented on this - there's no constituency for removing the AT. This decision has a 100% negative approval rating. *Everyone* either liked the AT or didn't care, and a lot of people liked it. Hard to see why CCP would shoot themselves in the foot on this one. It's super disturbing that they would do something this dumb/clueless, bodes very ill for the future. 
---
Well, since Nova's failure I'm sure they're working on developing another shit moneypit game that will never see the light of day.  Most likely a Battle Royale, I hear those are popular, it should be ready in 5 years or so once the fad is over.

It's an Ishtar, guns only take away from your fitting space for other more important mods like literally everything else on the ship

TLDR: Salty Boi unhappy about AT, sighs allot.

They call it: "transition"
---
Coming soon in the New Eden Store!
---
I'm a casual player of 12 years and definitely have always been excited for the AT as its something you can communicate to people outside of the game that isn't gibberish to them. Don't act like your experience is everyone's even us evil casual people.
---
[Well, there goes a few accounts](https://imgur.com/a/3Cgvjlx)
---
I think it's too early to tell. On my brief visits to HS it does seem more active to me though.
---
what. no AT? what
---
Caps is cruise control for cool...
---
Right after shield slaves
---
Perhaps they already did and the tickets are just getting responded by bots they set up previously and forgot to switch off...
---
I mean... These gala event posts aren’t good but man this video is on a whole nother level
---
Oct - ECM changes, no iteration since (most ECM hulls still useless, RIP widow pilots). Combat ceptor changes to finally kill swordfleets which have been a problem since aegis sov was introduced. Hilariously unpopular hictor changes that were thankfully looked at again after outcry from wormholers. And a Damavik change that somehow made the ship even less popular than it already was.
---
You forgot to add in here that the combat ceptor changes made 1/2 of the interceptor lineup completely useless, with no iteration since.
---
Unsubbed today. 9 year vet. No more RL money from me.
---
Dark days. I'm too bad at eve for AT but I know dudes get really hyped for it. I am genuinely saddened by this announcement and its implications concerning the future of our game.
---
Try Actiblizzard. 
---
What a great week it has been:
---
1. Chat not getting restored to normal
---
2. Shitty event
---
3. No more AT
---
&gt; cant monetize the AT
---
Yes you can sponsorship is a thing you know? eveNT do it so there's nothing stopping ccp 
---
"OMG IVE GOT IT! *VR WEREWOLVES!"* \- Someone in a CCP staff meeting probably
---
subscription slope!

;(
---
Damn... Pandemic Legion won't even get their annual participation trophy this year.
---
They'll all be in the CCPearl Abyss cash shop at some point, don't worry.
---
I don’t understand why missions aren’t at least voiced in. And maybe add more epic arcs like that would go a long way 
---
As someone who poured energy and love into making the AT happen, thank you. It meant a lot then, and it's gratifying to see people care about it so much still, and that it was worth the effort.
---
I do but some things still suck. Elder Scrolls Online ... and can't get Conan Exiles to run.
---
Worried EVE will throw in something that will break it.
---
Pissy shit cocks are the WORST cocks =(
---
Theory: they don’t want to do the AT because they don’t want more exclusive ships out there, there’s something in the meta and/or price dynamics that CCP doesn’t like but also doesn’t want to reveal.
---
I’m probably wrong, don’t hesitate to tell me why.
---
I was hoping for registration deets :(
---
Thank you
---
God I remember her introduction thread on the old eveo forums. That was such an entertaining trainwreck. 
---
It's worth a shot. Eve is not as complex as the other two and is way less intensive.
---
&lt;3
---
... and it would still be Valk, only with additional content and people to socialise.
---
C'mon guys.  He is right.  CCP is thinking about EVE because they are busy on "other" projects.  I say to the community, we should take their example to heart.    Ramp up your skill queue's to the maximum allowed and then yes wait for it.... TAKE A HAITUS.   Get together with your eve pals on teamspeak or discord or whatever so you can talk the situation over and THINK about what CCP is trying to do.  Maybe even have this conversation while participating in something new?  All I am saying is give CCP as much of your time as they seam to be giving you. 
---
First and only introduction thread to get locked!
---
Yep, none of my IRL friends are autistic enough to play EVE long term.  However, I have at least 5 that watch the AT every year after hearing about it from me, and most of them try to play the game for a few months after AT hypes them up.
---
I think its about time for CCP to go out of business at this point, they clearly don't care about EVE, and they're proven too incompetent to make any other successful projects.  Just end the pain.
---
Wait, you come to r/eve to find *positive* reinforcement? I think I've figured out why you haven't resubbed.
---
&gt; Evictus killed it with 50 feroxes today with XIX and some other individuals showing up to "whore" at the end. It doesn't count cause you put it in an alt corp?
---
it's incredible, you're so shit that the mere thought of reinforcements actually coming in if someone showed up to contest is out of the question, going as far as to link a kill with 270 people in two organized doctrines and claiming they just came to "whore" and weren't ready to get in at the slightest sign of resistance.
---
This is querns level of posting 
---
Yeah anything that is not run of the mill would probably take forever 
---
Send me all your ships and monies guys I’m loving the game
---
"CCP dont understand marketing" FTFY
---
A lot of this is because their entire dev focus after the last  couple years was to inflate numbers to make themselves attractive for a buyout.
---
After the PA announcement, it was painfully clear that's what they had been doing.  They don't give a shit about the health of the game, they just wanted their buyout.  The real CCP died years ago, any devs that gave a shit already left.  What a sad company, used to be one of the best.
---
Too coordinated I doubt CCP could spin a globe on one finger and eat a banana.
---
Thanks for all the practice with Templis Vordak. We couldn't have pushed as far as we did without such a great practice partner. o7
---
Won Eve in december and every time I visit here I realize what a good decision it was.
---
It sounded like they were on track to do a localized tourney at each Event this year. Perhaps instead of hopping onto the hate train you guys could read the article and realize that they are trying to focus on the things you want. 
---
The AT will be back next year. That's fine. CCP is doing several world wide events this year to reach out to all the people who play Eve but cannot for various reasons travel to Iceland to do so. I for one, am grateful. 
---
Eve has been a great game for me over the last decade. Show some faith in the company who developed and created the game in which you choose to play. 
---
Don't like it? Go play Fornite with all the other screaming 12 year olds. 
---
And please...if you do intend on "winning eve"....can I have your stuff?
---
no, anyone that left because of the old wardec system would have left eventually anyway, it was just the first phase of removing pvp outside of abyssal sites which is clearly CCPs end goal, wouldnt suprise me if highsec ganking is removed in the next 3 months.
---
Don’t worry bro, let me upvote you before the spastics downvote you and make the comment disappear, this comment should be seen.. Oh wait nvm, all the retards will take what you said too personal, because of course, they know the truth and then they will feel offended :(
---
&gt;Not to sound pessimistic.. but CCP has been saying this for what feels like 1.5 to 2 years
---
I remember they saying more or less the same thing going back as far as 2010
---
Believe that's called sov.
---
I've got to find an image that can fit on the sprite sheet so that'll take a bit - but the text flair is granted.
---
Investment companies dont come in to prop up ailing IPs and give them another shot at life, they come in to slash and burn, to monetize as aggressively as possible for as long as possible, then to liquidate assets and move on to the next victim.  Look at Firefall, Everquest Next, etc.
---
The hero we definitely don't deserve.
---
They did the alliance tournament last year. Those resources went to the AT.
---
They're telling you their plan for this coming year, which hasn't happened yet.
---
&gt;But no, we just get a generic "we're going to balance things!" statement that just gives me very little hope about any quick changes.
---
We'll be lucky if they start balance passes by December
---
[removed]
---
Yep same thing. Splash a hole - big lag time or screen freeze and crash. This has been intermittent since the new launcher. Don’t know if there is a connection to that or not.
---
This is a great idea. 
---
Its not for lack of trying, it's because they're literally retarded and don't know how to run a proper cash shop.  No, 20 dollar palette swap skins and 40 dollar shot glasses are not "microtransactions", CCREEEE.
---
starcitizen /s
---
This is a sandbox game where the players create the content. That’s literally the point of it. 
---
When did we suddenly start looking to CCP to give us reasons to play? 
---
They don't wanna divert time from that shiny new Battle Royale that they're making.  Also, adding another dev to the team would required reducing their SKIN artist team from 50 to 49, and Pearl Metrics have shown that this is not profitable.
---
Either find a mission hub in hisec and ninja salvage, join a null Corp and salvage after a supercarrier, or join a wh Corp and be the salvageboi. I’ve done #2 and #3, and I prefer the sleeper salvaging one, Nullsec salvage isn’t worth as much as exploring loot.
---
It's kind of ironic that this falls around the 1 year anniversary of me winning Eve. I gotta say guys, from the outside looking in, it's over. From the old days of Shadow Cartel, to cheering on PL and PHEW in the tournament, it really speaks volumes on how CCP's outlook on the game is clearly seen...
---
The Gala debacle, to canning the Tournament, to having no balance team? Blizzard's vast layoffs should also echo caution. If a company can just layoff hundreds of employees despite profits, where does that leave Eve Online? I hate to say it guys, but the Eve Online you knew and loved is frankly gone.
---
What is left, is a cash grab. A sham. SP pumping, injectors, rorquals, and a grind fest with zero meaning. I know it's hard to accept, but this is just one step of many to change Eve into another BDO cash cow. The BDO community warned us, and now it's actually taking place.
---
Best of luck Eve Online. Frankly, I'd find something better to fill your free time with. Just my 2 cents.
---
Ya, gutted by this news - on top of all the other shit that's dropped recently. Noting to look forward to, only bitter acceptance that it will continue to get worse.
---
It's been longer then 2 years: They never really finished tiericide, and that started in 2015. That was supposed to be the huge balance patch.
---
All new players are sucked into theran alliance and then they die in high sec anyway. 
---
the game feels like a house with all the lights still on but there's no furniture or appliances, a few months like this and the playerbase at large is going to start assuming this is the shutdown push.
---
Spider tanked!
---
Yep... sigh...
---
It really does feel like they are putting the minimum amount of money into running the game so they can qualify for their full sale bonus before they all cash out, pull the plug and just shutter the game with no notice.
---
Such a dramatic fucking sub.
---
It's okay i can afford the downvotes.
---
Where are all the tards now saying "EVE IS FINE, CCP HAS TO PUT ALL OF THEIR PROFITS IN \*insert really shitty idea for a game here\* SO THEY CAN DIVERSIFY AND MAKE MORE MONEY!!!"
---
Dont worry, you can soon buy the skin from plex store ;)
---
You have to say CCPlease
---
Yea, that's fair.
---
&gt; They already canceled the terrible FPS they had planned.
---
I'd actually be happy if they canceled it, but their last announcement read more like they are going to keep working on it and try to release it later because its a hot pile of shit currently.
---
for 500 plex!
---
Good dudes, hope they find what they're looking for.
---
I think it looks sexy though.
---
!remindme 3 days
---
It actually has been mind boggling watching how many people have still been sucking CCP's nuts on this forum over the last 2-3 years, when they have very clearly lost all passion for the game and every decision is "how to make the most money with least effort".  How much shit will it take before the average persono finally realizes what's going on?

Just play Alpha mode. Dont bother giving them more money.
---
And what would happen is that the routes into and out of that system would instantly become the most gatecamped in the game (and not the fightable kind, either, but the simple farmers cancer kind that fucks off to a citadel the moment anything remotely scary gets within 14 AU), because the playerbase of this game is its own worst enemy sometimes.
---
You assume I've been sleeping. There's been a definite change in the past few years and things feel different but thinking things will stay the same forever is not reasonable either.
---
I don't want them to *rot*, I want to see them prosper and succeed. The next year will definitely be interesting.
---
Not an AT morale post (I hope)
---
You guys all have phones right?
---
The fucked up part is that he left months ago, but they kept all his greedy money grabbing ideas for later use.
---
They don't listen though. Anytime they have proposed changes, the gsf csm reps tell them "OK so here's how this could be horribly abused by a large bloc to create a massive advantage for themselves". Then the changes just get pushed through as is, and everyone's just standing around like, OK well I guess we abuse this loophole until they fix it in 5 years
---
It's not like Provi got them back either. So Win/Win?
---
I guess to each his own. I'm tired of "hoping for a brighter future" when every time there's even a glimmer of hope they just smother it with shit and then say "eat up!" with a filthy grin...
---
You can jump in to stations as long as you have a clone there. If you are already there it is highly likely you will be unable to install a clone when you try to jump out.
---
They can't seem to fix anything without breaking everything else why not let someone else have a shot at it? Based on reviews posted by former employees they don't exactly attract 5 star employees because of how shit they treat people who aren't from Iceland and their compensation package is reported to be less than stellar, maybe letting some players actually invested in the games survival with a talent for coding try and work on it would be a good thing?
---
Why do you play this game? What's your favorite part?
---
See ya when you come back. In the meantime make sure to safe up your stuff!

That isn't the kind of content we're talking about.
---
We mean actually new stuff from the developers, new PvE, positive changes to SOV mechanics, citadels, continued balancing and tiericide, etc. This also includes big events like AT and Fanfest.
---
CCP is basically just letting EVE stagnate into the ground at this point, now cancelling the two biggest events of the year which is unprecedented. 
---
If they no longer care enough to continue improving the game, why should we care and keep subscribing to a dwindling player count and stagnant, diseased still-water universe?
---
And the worst part is, many of the AT participants are at least to a degree the population of “EVE-celebrities” and content creators. 
---
With those people winning eve due to this shit move, we’ll have even less YouTube videos, less shitposts, overall less community engagement. 
---
Not only does CCP fuck over the play style of many of those players, but they also remove the last “safe haven” of high-tier *guaranteed* content, the AT (which was something people could rely on, with many playing only for the AT due to the “nanogang-meta” being killed.
---
Keep in touch on discord. Ill direct you to some of the player run tournaments and find you a team if need be. 
---
I honestly don't think they're lying, and that they do intend to bring it back.
---
I just don't think they're going to actually be able to. It's going to become that project in the garage that you keep telling yourself you'll get around to, but never actually get the chance.
---
I swear to god this event is just a giant fucking troll.
---
I hope they make good on their reason for taking a break. Eve is in desperate need of balance changes, what's the point in watching a tournament of a game that you Hardly play because it's all broken? 
---
We play the game because of strong community.
---
CCP cancelling AT and Fanfest *shits* on that community
---
You forgot CCP Gargant in your list of stewards. He took up the torch from CCP Bro and then passed it to me. 
---
As for the rest of the post, it seems to be pretty close to my thoughts as well. I'm not quite as confident as you are in its return, but I would be delighted to be found to have been pessimistic. It could go either way, but based on the reaction so far it's not a forgone conclusion that this is the end.
---
because fuck the playerbase that's why right u/CCP_sledgehammer ?
---
Needs more blockchain but otherwise nailed it.
---
Really interesting commentary for some really neat fights, my dude! Some background music might be nice for future vids :3
---
I'm done thats it.
---
This game is a goner people gotta accept it
---
That and the launcher link reads "details on future plans for Alliance Tournament" - that's definitely misleading considering the news item is that there is going to be no AT and the rest of the post is unrelated justifications trying to spin it as a good thing, not "future plans for AT". Shit news and shit delivery.
---
Unless his clone is in a wormhole
---
Which will be right after they finish adding all the other structures they haven't talked about in months.
---
lol, actually playing eve in 2019
---
ALL OF THE SHOTS! but the real question is, what ship was he flying? What's his max payload? Did he have a cargo of just ammunition? SO MANY VARIABLES!
---
\&gt; Skillu always trying to form, getting 60-70 guys and then standing down. 
---
what kind of a glue eating retard do you have to be to say dumb shit like this?
---
This just in CCP fired everyone who can do math so they don't see a problem with the current refine rate.
