&gt;So I want to talk to some Subject Matter Experts who can tell me what it's like to fly and fight against other players. 
---

---
context,  you asking about highsec, lowsec, nullsec, FW, wormhole.
---
also, are you refering to current time,  5 years ago, Great War era,  Northern Civil War era,  or beta era? 
---
example: around the civil war era(or slightly after), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WkYqWn3HSQ
---
after the Great War era....

---
all are different and change often.  see Empires of EVE for an explanation of 2003-2009.
---
&gt;What strategies are employed?
---
sounds like your looking for an FC,  but again, this will vary based on the coalition, time period, and location.
---
&gt;What weapons and countermeasures?
---
these are fairly basic.  N+1.
---
aka, if your enemy is in cruisers, you bring BC.
---
if your enemy is in battle cruisers, you bring battleship.
---
it keeps going like this until titans, where its "they bring 1 titan, you bring 2".
---
weapons depend on what form of fighting you want.  from Drone boats like Gilas and Ishtars.
---
to high alpha strikes from artillery.
---
plus shield, armor, hull tanks all affect it.    does enemy have logi.  etc.
---
theres a comic book called "real eve stories".  its not really real. but its how we view ourselves in the game.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTT0K_u9XyY
---
------------------
---
EVE is basically changing extremely fast and extremely variable based on what your expecting the enemy to bring, where, and what alliance your a part of (Test are known for shield caps for example)
---
---
---
I didn't know that it could help. I'll be sure to do that
---
This is the kind of content that keeps me coming back

And observe the subjects health as the cancer is administered the quickness the subject’s health decays. As it spreads through whole nervous system affecting every neuron. Ultimately the subject’s ability to maintain health and function declines to the point it ceases, and dies.

---
The sound system in eve puts a non-negligible load on your cpu to run. For large fleet fights and scenarios where stability is important sound is one of the first things players cut in order to keep their clients from crashing.
---
Legend has it that the sound system is still tied to the old spaghetti POS code.
---
I got one for the navy geddon. Just waiting for the day CCP actually makes it good. Then ill be ready.
---
Every BPO comes from an NPC vendor. Every ISK spent buying from NPC vendors disappears.
---
Capital component, capital ship, and super/Titan BPOs are a lot of ISK.
---
Also, researching BPOs requires spending ISK on system index based fees, almost all of which are pure ISK sinks. Structure owner taxes are calculated as a portion of that sink.
---
So unless you’re researching ME/TW in a structure in a private WH with a 0% index you’re sinking a non-trivial amount of ISK.
---
Source: I’m dumb and own several researched-up BPOs, this doing my part in keeping ISK-flation at in check?
---
Next goal should be becoming a contributing member of an alliance
---
O I though they turned up in exploration
---
Stainguy is a member of Goonswarm Federation, he long since abandoned his namesake and as a result is shunned by the rest of the Guys. Smh @ StainGuy.
---
Name it someone else's ship
---
He wants to PvP. I don't think Eve Cartel/Signal Cartel allow PvP unless it's in self-defense.
---
I did not downvote you or anything. Just sayin, a lot of peoples mindset on reddit reminds me of Tyrion Lanister's mindset regarding Cersei and her army.
---
i can't believe people upvoted his comment, if you took 10 seconds and looked at the subreddit they're mostly 1 liners
---
This is why I love eve.
---
Nice of goons to clear a new home for them in the drone lands eh.
---

---
I could be going crazy but this makes it sound like NC. is going to undock?
---
You misunderstand, they still won't give a shit about spaceships or Eve Online. That would not be the motivating factor here, and if by some chance anything did come out of it, it would not be limited only to Eve Online. To understand what I posted, you'd have to live there for a few years like I did or at least do some research on the culture.
---
ME = Material Efficiency
---
TE = Time Efficiency

I would never do such a thing.
---
Oh I know. This just seemed like a good opportunity to give StainGuy some shit.
---
No, he is asking an Icelandic company to close the gates in front of thousands of Chinese players

How long does it take to train the skills to build them?

Ok, I'm bad at taking screenshots, especially when I keep switching back to normal view every other second to make sure nothing has showed up on overview/dscan, but the deathglow hunters astero skin is by far my favorite
---
&gt;That would be an incredibly scummy thing to do, and I have zero respect for anyone who tries it.
---
Lesser of the 2 evils to me. I'd rather have less bots, hacks, cheats, and all that shit. So I guess its a matter of perspective. Also, we already tried and exhausted other options, its time to kick it up a notch or two.
---
&gt;Only when the entire thing is in Chinese Jurisdiction.

Speaking of, from the EULA:
---
 
---
&gt;16. GOVERNING LAW AND EXCLUSIVE FORUM  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The EULA, and the rights and obligations of the parties hereto, shall be governed and construed by and in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Iceland. The EULA shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.
---
So conflicting laws ? Or does Serenity have a different EULA ? Perhaps its localized by region / server ?
---
TBH it's a large part of why CCP is so utterly incompetent.  They've been progressively getting worse over the years and people keep giving them a pass for "reasons".  They've never had a reason to improve and now it's probably too late.
---
You're catching down votes but you're not wrong. This racist stuff is getting stupid in this sub. Every single post is the same crap over and over and the majority of the sub is OK with it. I personally welcome the new players coming to our server and the discussion in this sub lately is disgusting. Thankfully this sub is a small but extremely vocal minority of the player base and doesn't represent the majority.
---
I tried this with the name of someone I don't know, but the was so long that when i renamed my trasher, I could only fit it in a way that it said the name + trash, so I was mercyless hunted trough 7 systems before I died
---
Because there's no bots in the game now right and inflation isn't running wild for lots of reasons. Also VPNs don't exist.
---
It will be dantumi
---
&gt;By that time they’ll finally let the game die.
---
Nah, am willing to bet they will be looking for more ways to milk it just a little more... Maybe another platform, remarketing, maybe another regional server with some "partner" somewhere ... Who knows ?
---
Down under where?
---
Ancillary repair BPCs, T2 rig BPCs, integrated analyzer BPCs, implant and booster BPCs, and faction variant player-owned starbase deployables BPCs are the only blueprints that drop to my knowledge. None of them are originals, they're all copies with 1-25 runs.
---
&gt;Theirs only got so bad because Netease didn't enforce any botting standards.
---
I would like to point out that CCP is not far behind Netease in this regard. Short term profits via increased accounts number, ineffective banwaves where all the botters are back usually within a few days, week at most. Only 2 people on the sec team, and as the sec team and just look at their posts here on reddit. Last time, I think it was a month ago or so, they posted that their banwave queue is 2 months long. Meanwhile, again, banned bots come back within a week tops. Think about this for a moment.
---
As a new player, what is this?
---
And overheat ?
---
Here's the real kicker as you get experience you will manage to get twice that yield an hour.  That is about 3 Relic sites average in null.  Some single sites if you hit a jackpot might be a few hundred million even (rare)
---
I really love how in every game the Chinese get blamed for everything, yet the EU and US blocks are perfectly fine with shooting each other and the smaller entities in their timezone, while trying to make everyone believe the Chinese are the real problem...
---
Eh, just pointing it out now, before you get shot down.
---
No coming back here and whining when CCP send you a cease and desist.
---
Speaking of EWAR drones, the otehr ones, not ECM, need a bit of love cause they're too ineffective to the point of not being used.
---
And explosions. Tho mostly u exploding :3
---
Serenity will have a different EULA, I'm sure.
---
Side effect of doing business in China.
---
(and many countries hold that their laws supersede things like EULA.)
---
Serenity isn't directly operated by CCP. Everything runs through their local publisher, because China.
---
it's due for it, new nerds are always good :)

What's the counter to an ECM Falcon 200km off Mr l33t pilot?
---
Cool. I'm ok with being a newbro in a corp. It's been a while so I'm kinda new all over again!
---
Caldari are shield and missiles, maybe have an ewar that fucks with missiles - causing them to potentially spiral off course each shot. Or something that fries the HP of shields
---
&gt;ECM fighters don't have a presence at all like ECM drones do.
---
That is largely because they can take out any sub cap they feel like off the field which is much more effective then ECM would be, while they're crap vs other caps. Not because they're not OP.
---
Hmm, heres a thought, maybe give the carrier and super carrier EWAR fighters some bonus to make them effective vs caps/supers to the point that this would give them a at least a secondary role ?
---
If you are anchoring it solo it would probably be a good idea to anchor it in a more remote place, if II anchor it in jita some local gankers could try to attack it
---
The biggest ~~red~~ eve pill here.
---
I tried to answer some questions, but it seems to be full of fear. Fear of ignorance, fear of the unknown, fear of the future. Pessimism spread
---
For the longest time I have been wondering why Gallente doesn't have a single dampener bonused battleship of any sort. Not BLOPS, not marauder, not navy, not T1, not even mixed pirate faction. Every single one of the otehr EWAR in the game has some battleship representation somewhere, except damps.

---
Always named my explo ships Amarr Control Tower :D
---
make it so
---
IDK about the coding BS, but the reality is as is. whether you believe it or not.
---
&gt;If they removed ECM jammers they'd have to reimburse everyone who isn't retarded and actually SPed into the sensor compensations.
---
Hello
---
Retarded ex Widow pilot here skileld into sensor compensations as well as ECMs  :(
---
Haha, why do I feel that they are a bit like 5G Huawei?
---
met someone who was asking some newbro questions in local. talked for about 20mins and then contracted them some frigs and fittings so they can go get blown up and have fun. for free.
---
that felt nice. it's been about a week and just today they inboxed me a quick thank you with their first km linked.
---
that's what has kept me playing. the kindness of strangers who are further along than i am.
---
eve is kind of like my real life in this way. so eve is nice :)
---
remove all scripts
---
finaly web drones .. time to shine. VNI MASTER RACE
---
Bout tree fid... ah 2017
---
what happened on serenity ?
---
Adventures like those were why I kept playing EVE. I didn't know I could bookmark the wormhole back, I got a couple of wormholes
---
&gt;I see your point but it was one of the few ways to handle triglavian ships.
---
Bro, you can use lotsa things for that. Damps + kitey, tracking disruptors also do a major number on them, long range webs you don't need to perma slow them jsut cause them to fall back to miss a cycle or 2, remember you don't need to make them not hit you, jsut lose their spool up and you have a freagin minute for that unless you fit bad or jsut flat out picked a wrong ship for it in which case you're screwed no matter what.
---
Like a newborn, nothing is brought.
---
 It takes courage
---
You are right, your posting is the worst abuse going on.
---
Yeah GF until the super came in. I was on my way back from reshipping lol
---
Their version of goons and panfam did a super brawl to death resulting in the largest battle in eve. After that PIBC didn't really have any competition. The story is longer of course but that is usually seen as the point were PIBC won
---
Better yet, they can't leave Jita, but are prohibited from accessing the Market.
---
That’s awesome! Once you get into killing rats in a well-fitted Rattlesnake, you should hop on twitch and do some narrated PvE.
---
Lots of new players want to learn.
---
holy shit the bpos
---
Intact armor plates are still valuable, 6.8m each last time I checked.
---
rent free
---
It seems that some people are beginning to fear that they will not occupy Europe like Syrian refugees.
---
Always good to see new players getting into exploration. Helpful tip is to research where you are exploring so that you know what loot you will be getting and who lives there. Practicing not dying will also help
---
&gt;hello we already have PLA and FRT in Tranquility but you don't hear anyone complaining about them
---
Ummm, many of FRT are PIBC.
---
Yeah I loved that playstyle. It helped fund faction warfare, which was great, but was clearly a different game altogether. I think it was wingspan who helped me discover playstyle. Finding a viable way to fund your in game endeavors is one of the most important factors in a player playing for a long time in my opinion. Finding a challenging but fun way to do this is a huge bonus.
---
Not netease.
---
Netease are the new publisher. (They're not out of closed beta yet, due to slowness with the Chinese government's censorship departments)
---
Tiancity were the old publisher
---
give me my free titan
---
I'll pay 2.3 isk
---
Original Blueprints (infinite runs) with efficiency research for every non faction super capital in the game. Each one of these blueprints are extremely valuable on their own, and a complete set is even more impressive
---
If they introduced some anti-drone ewar, that would be cool. Caldari's foes, Gallente love drones, so it would make perfect sense if they would introduce second ewar for Caldari in this form.
---
There already is anti-missile ewar, no need to double it's function.
---
But not all of them.
---
Most of the people here will recomand you to join a big nullsec corporation cause that's what the majority of the playerbase do. 
---
But personally, i got a very mediocre experience trying that. You will be forced to train special ships and even to participe in some fleets. Those "Fleets" will most of the time litterally be resumed in pressing F1 following the orders of an FC. The massive sizes of these corps will make it impossible for you to know everybody and you'll always be surrounded by strangers. Some corps will even forbid you to speak in the local channel and will pressure you when you'll get killed "to preserve the image of the corp". Some people like that shit, but it's not my case.
---
It's not all dark and as a new player you'll always get awnsers to your questions since there will always be people available, but at the end, I think it's a lot more helpful to be surrounded by only a few people you'll end up really knowing and that will personally help you trought your adventure.
---
I strongly recomand you to join a small corp. Nullsec, hisec, wormhole space... it doesn't matter. What matters is the corp itself.
---
If you want you probably can join us, we're a small wormhole corp. just have to ask the others members first. Not actively trying to recruit you, do what you want. But we're nice ^^
---
Wut
---
This was one of the better EVE Onion articles and they've been seriously on point recently.  Nicely done!
---
you got a hate bonner for him or something?
---
Oh that shitler again.
---
1-50 runs, and special depots/MTUs but the rest is good info
---
Wally, please take your medications, you’ve started posting again.
---
I think my favorite part is that it's not even like it's difficult to tell. You have to be flat our lying to pretend that Third New Universe isn't a bot corp. Even better yet it's been running for literal months. If feels like CCP doesn't give a fuck. I can understand struggling with the small time botters but this is so blatant there is zero chance they don't know it's happening. Sure you can argue they're trying to catch some larger fish and that they'll be remade quickly but it doesn't take 4 months to figure out where the isk from a corp that does literally nothing but botting might be going. What the fuck is CCP even doing? How is the security team even getting paid when dumb shit like this exists for such extended periods of time?
---
This isn't a defense of the duder but unless CCP changed their policy subscribers getting an advantage is not RMT. Needing to subscribe to even have a chance at a prize on twitch is RMT. That was CCPs stance about a year ago at least.
---
Here's some advice, change the name of your ship, so they don't hunt you later, otherwise, really good loot, good job!
---
Sounds like a just punishment for being a regular viewer of such boring lame shit.
---
What was in the wreck worth 191M?   A player wreck or a rat wreck?
---
Fly a probe. Name it scanner probe I
---
Of all the complaints against the Chinese this might be the only one I'll call you a retard for. If they're not cheating they're absolutely welcome to abuse any mechanics/play the game CCP built.
---
An ECM falcon 200km off obviously.
---
Never got a 50-run BPC, didn't know they existed. I'm kicking myself about the variant MDs and MTUs though, I have a couple BPCs for them laying around that I got from explo.
---
And o/ is a wave. Brave does 7o because they want to.
---
Oh I thought you were quoting me for being dumb naive (jokes aside I seriously don't think they WONT bot).
---
GoT reference flew right over my head, don't watch it  &gt;:D
---
counterpoint: dumb is awful
---
It’s about 2000 days for me10 yeah?
---
I hate Wally and the Widow is a piece of shit.
---
Ey that sounds good, drone EMP pulse
---
Boooooooo!
---
Well done!
---
Took me months and many, many systems to get to that kind of ISK. Super Jelly.
---
people asked for fighter nerfs, they nerfed them      
---
people asked for less tank on rorquals, they got it       
---
people asked for ways to harass people, they got ess and never put ingame that abomination decloaker of 2011 plus inhibs     
---
people asked for ships that are good vs capitals, they introduced new a whole race of heavy dps ships      
---
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT YOU WHINNIE MANCHILDS. Literally do you want a supercarrier sacrifice everytime you undock to roam? Would you be happy with 30 caracals suiciding to your nanogang in every staging system?

---
I was flying a Hel on a large move op up north back during WWB, and "Y" asked me to rename it from "X's Hel", so I made it "Y's Hel" xD
---
Not really.
---
More information is needed
---
I've always wondered why this guy has so many viewers. He just AFK farms Moon rocks. I'm still less than three months old but in the first weeks I started playing I went into his discord to see if I could get answers and noob help and it was a ghost town.
---
♥️♥️♥️
---
Do you just do harder combat sites that give more Isk per tick in a rattle?
---
That sounds like it could make for a legitimately awesome mini-game. 3 on 3 volleyball. Players can't cross the center line, and the Venture pilot has to keep flying forward in the last direction they were knocked (AB on). One side scores a point when the venture makes it 20km past the starting line.
---
Do you just do harder sites in a rattle and get higher ticks? I'm currently getting about 45 to 50 mil an HR in my VNI which isn't so bad. I'm lacking heavy drone 5 and interfacing 5 ATM.
---
It's basically 3 faction bcus in the lows and a damage control to round it out. Hob ii's on top of t2 hams. I usually just stick with kinetic rage... Jav as required. Try it out! I also have command ships 5 :/.  And it's like 972 dps to be exact 
---
I'm at work atm but I'll copy/paste when I get home!
---
Since he's not delivering in game items / isk, it's still in game scam
---
530ish days for me from ME 9 to ME 10, but that means missing out on around 25 BPCs.
---
Change it to “Sup, noobs.”  
---
This will save you from having to type it in local while trying to steer thru a bubble camp at same time.

[Here is a thread from](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/arhctm/blatant_rmt_streamer_guide_to_win_giveaways_for/) a few months ago about this same guy.

Spoiler alert: He's a gigantic piece of shit, but it's OK, because you're racist and couldn't fathom his culture and why being a fucking cretin is perfectly OK.

Legit question say you are streaming and asking for in-game ISK donations (let's say 10-15 mil) and a minimum of 10 participants in return you do a raffle giveaway and your users have a chance to win is that considered RMT or against TOS?
---
I'm in CLT, (Matthews/Stallings/Mint Hill area) but probably won't be able to make it. VBGB is great, you folks have fun!
---
find someone with a lot of kills (not losses) in a magnate and rename your ship &lt;That persons name&gt;'s Magnate
---
&gt; something that fries the HP of shields
---
Like... Guns? Or something?
---
So basically, he's not breaking eula because he's not giving away any items. Good job detective.
---
No one uses Geddons because Bhaals are better, Nestor’s are great for farming and are popular on fleets that carry refits (Pancake fleets), Snakes are common in home defence and Pancakes are used for evictions, here’s an example that EPSYN was involved in: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/90xh9z/aar_we_found_razor/?st=juovtbdg&amp;sh=2ef17094

Can confirm. Been playing for 6 years and still routinely forget to do this.
---
 I'm sure someone said something similar about the last batch of immigrants from Serenity all those years ago and no one stomping them out they still bot and build more titans
---
Do you think the Scorpion needs love?

This isn't GameStop...

I literally do not care and if you keep banging on about it I'll subscribe to give him higher numbers.

I left in 2009 and would have been able to buy 2-3 PLEX if I had spent all my ISK.

A while. You need capital ship construction 5, which I think 4-5 alone is a month +
---
Good on you for keeping the fire going, Hedliner. Fuck these haters.

My guess is a titan left behind a faction spawn that had a good faction item or low value implant.

Also another reason to keep an eye on dscan if you bookmark those and drop coordinate cans for alts to grab.

Hey Reza, Eve Toronto?

Take my upvote. :-)
---
Ok I want you to think about this.  
---
Our playerbase has botted and inflated the market over the course of 16 years for plex prices to reach 2 billion isk.  
---
The chinese playerbase have been botting and inflating the market for like 6 years in order for plex prices to reach 20 billion isk.  
---
The chinese group that is migrating to our server is like 90% of serenity playerbase meaning around 90% of the bots.  
---
The economy is going to tank at record speeds.
---
Good clip, shit post.
---
Can we stop using the word chinese. Use Eastern origin players.
---
Man I love Ricardo memes in all their forms but this post is just shite
---
rip widow.

and the upcoming ECM drone nerf....just...give widow a new bonus

I had a vague idea about bump-soccer a while back. keepstar at either end a goals. stabbers or machs as bumpers. freighter (or something else?) as the ball.

Ranges and damage of certain rats (for example, Grip rats deal huge amounts of damage, but only at blaster range)
---
Clouds, and their effects on your ship

Which types of rats to prioritize first when in specific fits

Personally, I'm from Korea, and I partially agree that easterns are viewd as potential botter or cheater that west gamer. and sadly it is true at some point (really sad to me). I trust majority of eastern players are also normal gaming player, there are some shitty player really 'enjoy' abusing rules if not punished. I have seen this uncontrolled abusing people at DNF, Overwatch, Division, or whatever. That small portion of player (10%?) really ruins game. I really welcome PIBC for AUTZ (I will all it KRTZ to my friend anyway) contents, and it will be good for game. I hope CCP to really suppress 'any' botters to make innocent players free from hate. (Yes I'm against my alliance propaganda :O)
---
Nice. Another nerf from CCP of something I invested skillpoints into. My Widow will continue collecting dust I guess and we’ll never know what using the other flavors of EWAR drones feels like. 
---
It sure would be nice to read patch notes and see something other than an assortment of nerfs. There are things players they could be doing that players actually want...
---
&gt; I dont know much about serenity politics.
---
It literally shows.
---
As such, you might tone down your sarcasm.
---
Botting was against the rules there aswell, but sadly it appearently is against chinese law to enforce these rules.
---
do you have any idea how many competitors have BPOs? for example how many Avatar BPC sellers would you estimate there are?
---
the old icon for the DCU was a suitcase
---
Except that server isn't even being managed by CCP and ridiculous local regulations completely hampered the possibility of stepping up enforcement. But we should totally welcome a large group of people to our server with a stagnant player base with dumb assed racism.

Why is there a TEST guy in a SLYCE blops drop

Absolutely deserved it for approaching a Brutix and sitting comfortably in Void range

3 faction bcus, t2 hams on top of command ships 5.  I think the entire fit comes in at around 1bil. The shiniest item is the mwd :/

30 mins later - start ratting after collecting 300m in relic loot.
---
Sounds like gambling to me tbh (so against the ToS)
---
...and in EVE, we all agree to hate wormholers.

Ostatnio duzo zamieszania z jakims politykiem tak czytam. Tez mam troche do powiedzenia na temat polityka tylko innego...

Yo HVP! Dalej masz zamiar startowac w wyborach na tubylczego posla czy tam premiera? I naprawde nie przeszkadza Ci w tym fakt, ze Twoja firma, niekompetentna deweloperska kurwa powszechnie znana jako CCP, udostepnia swoim subskrynentom filmy pornograficzne z udzialem niczego nieswiadomych przybyszow do tubylczego kraju, ktorzy nie maja pojecia, ze apartament, ktory wynajmuja jest zajebany waszymi kamerami, a nagrania z niego sa pozniej upubliczniane?
---
Jak tam? Projekt sie udal? Inwestorzy zadowoleni? Kazda kurwa zaangazowana w niego nahapala sie tak jak zakladano? Jakby sie ktos nie zorientowal to wszystko to sa pytania regoryczne. Kiedys jeszcze mialem mnostwo pytan, na ktore chcialem znac odpowiedz. Teraz nie mam zadnego. Poznalem wystarczajaco dobrze wasz swiat, zeby zrozumiec, ze to nie moze byc moj swiat. Poza tym, po co zadawac pytanie komus, kto powie ci prawde w zaleznosci od tego jakie pytanie uslyszy?

WTS mining permit with exceptional discount
---
@u/notjaffo, if you are brave enough and trust in the idea, you can go to the region of Providence and mine there without being hassled for the most part. CVA Coalition doesn't target neutrals actively. They have a policy of NRDS. So as long as you abide by some rules, play nice with others, and chat with the people of Provi, you can mine ur heart out. 
---
Of course you need to make sure you are not KoS with providence block and you can do that at [https://kos.cva-eve.org/](https://kos.cva-eve.org/)
---
I'm pretty sure yourself knew the best if you run a lot of abyssal sites
---
people are unhappy because pibc will have fights in AUTZ because that doesnt happen rn.
---
So what ur saying is that these players coming over to TQ are just going to not bot at all? CCP barely does anything about botting so how would this change anything besides there being a few less bots? And how am I being racist when I am backing up what I am saying with actual statistics? All I'm doing is looking at what has happened in the past and am looking at their gaming culture to figure out that this massive influx of Chinese players will provide more PvP and a crappier economy.
---
Seriously. All of the Minnie capitals (sans Ragnarok) are the best IMO
---
why pay when you can just join goons, take a tackle frig on a fleet once a month, and mine the rest of the month for free.
---
what's the point in that?  I'd almost rather someone thought I was a new player
---
speak for yourself, aussies were a mistake
---
My first successful wormhole exploration loot I felt the same way! Kudos! Good luck out there in the DireEntropy! Lol
---
i'd buy that for a dollar
---
nice. contracted you something in Jita when you omega hopefully to use on your next adventure. Fly safe :)
---
Legit.
---
People don’t care about Chinese players, they care about cheating. As long as these new players follow the rules, they should be welcome here on tranquility like anyone else, but only if they can follow the rules. No VPN Alpha farms, no super bots, no buying ISK, no ultranationalism. Let me be clear, it’s not Chinese, it’s cheating that’s a problem.
---
That being said, we shouldn’t circle jerk and white knight and dismiss the reality that gaming culture is different in China. They’re more accepting of botting and RMT, which can legitimately ruin a good game. CCP doesn’t have the best track record of catching botters, so people are worried. Serenity was a disaster. Even Brendan Green, the creator of PUBG, acknowledged that the overwhelming majority of hackers on the PC version are from China, and it only takes one to ruin a lobby. 
---
TL;DR - it’s cheaters, NOT Chinese we’re worried about, but the reality is that a lot of Chinese players cheat.
---
Nice dude!
---
Not to brag, alright. Im bragging. but my average runs can net me around 2billion.
---
It's also over the course of like 3 hours. But we dont talk about time.
---
People steal forgetting they are starting from scratch.  They cant transfer chars, sp or assets.
---
But this is where skill  injectors were the worst thing ccp ever did because in a day they can become a powerhouse.  Pretty ridiculous really
---
I thought we hate gon. grr gon.
---
yeah, i prefer to use many thin slices of banana so they can be layered.
---
just remove caps from lowsec, let null be the cap brawl zone. a lot more small gangs and solo players would roam lowsec for fights
---
Some people do inflate their own numbers using bots.
---
I don't think it does though because it's in-game items there's no exchange of money.
---
 And to fly one?
---
Yea I remember eve-scout and zarvox doing the same thing never got in trouble.
---
They will probably RMT some assets on serenity -&gt; Buy plex on Tranquility -&gt; Sell for isk -&gt; Fund their start up empire and then go from there.
---
I'd worry less about the sugar and more about using a disposable plate.
---
This is a proper super pilot, jdcv, fighters v, heavy t2s burst IV at least carrier IV etc.
---
I guess if you dont' need those (I do), you can do it with less.
---
You need also about 30b for the hull and fitting (top tier fitting) and the books, so 75bil should be just enough (can be done with less as stated).
---
I honor all permits as long as they aren't afk.
---
naah, Revenant is the best mothership
---
What kind of traffic offenses are you committing?  Yeesh...
---
&gt; About PIBC in Serenity: we need more enemies, stop recruiting every newbs after server starts, let our enemies grow a bit, also we are going to shrink our territory a bit.
---
Wow. Finally someone with a brain.
---
How exactly did they ruin thier server?
---
They won't start from Tama
---
I think they'll be worse than an average null bloc.
---
Care to share fits or other tips for us Alpha explorers trying to make it big?  I've had a few runs that brought in around 30-40 mil, which is way more than I've ever made doing anything else, but averaging 2billion would be amazing!
---

---
I mean TEST is fully independent on Goons.
---
Oh, and INIT is a strong and independent alliance too.
---
About half a year to sit in one, around two to be effective in them.
---
It’s nothing more than a stereotype telling you that the Chinese have more cheaters. I feel very sad.
---
What ever happened to northern unity NC? Remember when Horde and BL were fighting GOTG NC was having a bit of a hissy fit over it?

Or make ECM able to jam fighters, one of the few counters to fighter blobs in the game basically gone
---
wally shitpost printer is working overtime this week
---
First:
---
Dotlan. Dotlan is your friend.
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/region select a good region. Not drone. Preferably something like angels or something. make your pick.
---
Create a path, give yourself ample time to do said path. Or safe spots along the way.
---
Wormholes ARE your friend. Once you hit null sec, and I recommend you go there, look for wormholes as well.
---
http://anoik.is/
---
Class 1 2 and 3 wormholes sometimes have relic sites you can do. If unsure, google em before doing. But their names should be the same as nullsec.
---
Go to nullsec.
---
Since you dont have a cloak the best methods are either: flying up or down on a gate to create a warp point so you never warp directly onto a gate, this is bad coz bubbles are a thing. boom. blap. ded.
---
Or you can just warp to a random object, create a bookmark randomly then fly there then fly up and down while watching D-scan for combat probes.
---
If you see other scanning probes, just leave. safer to leave.
---
If you take the same path back as you did in, track signatures so you know not to rescan.
---
All relic and data sites have levels. Levels 1 and 2 data sites are generic. Level 3 can be either ghost (they go pop after x time and take u with em, speed runs.) or generic. Lvl 4 can be generic or sleeper. Lvl 5 generic or sleeper.
---
relic sites in null go to lvl 4. Lvl 4 is the best. No rats.
---
When you've if its a relic or data u can mouse over and see its level.
---
Report him on Twitch, he's violating TOS for affiliate/partner. He's view botting, he's not actually there as a streamer, and he's often running the wrong game (with said view bots) on the eve stream, most likely to hide his view bots on a less active game.[All of these are reportable offenses according to twitch](https://i.imgur.com/iiZKL3U.png)
---
ill make more, dont you dare me
---
it's about damn time
---
This was soooo 2018
---
Wasn't there a twitch rule about gifts and giveaways to watch being banned?
---
I’m new why is this important?
---
That sounds crazy made up but ok.
---
more story plz
---
Umm sorry its been a few days, but I'd like to ask something. Assuming I have like a 4 mil budget, would I be able to get an Algos fully fitted for PvE over there in Esoteria? Also, what's the approx ISK/m3 cost for your jump freighter services approximately? Thanks. I'm planning my moving in.
---
Also check out Nobutadas on Twitch! He does quite a bit of null sec exploration as well - I learned so much from that dude!
---
You can in fact rent space, where you're allowed to mine in a specific system for a monthly fee.
---
You're still subject to passing predators
---
&gt; People are NOT going to let that happen again. 
---
Like who? Imperial Legacy would welcome their new blues, everyone else is too weak to kill PIBC.
---
Because some people still have thier souls.
---
It's good to finally see some action being taken on this known Imperium RMT streamer
---
Well then, I think I will train subcaps to V
---
Does it even matter at this point of the game? None of you cunts in null sec are ever going to do anything remotely scary awesome ever again. Ya'll are in the same class as today's "grab a bag and scoop your dog's poop" after he shits somewhere. Useless twanks
---
Prefix под(о)- amongst others has a meaning of approach and sneakiness on verbs.
---
I’d wager it started as “поскань” and transformed from there for clarity. Quite a lot of slang used in time critical situations gets affected by clarity considerations.
---
1.) There are 'rental' systems available. You pay a chunk of cash to one of the big Null-sec SOV-holding alliances, and you have exclusive access to a given system. The cost is usually north of 1 billion per month, however.  
---
2.) You can join any of the Big-Three new-player friendly null-bloc as a member. (Horde, BRAVE, KarmaFleet) Some have activity requirements, some don't. Horde doesn't require you to go on any fleets, so long as you're actively logging-in. Not only this, but there's refineries available, juicy moons to mine, opportunities to make friends and experience the rest of the game.  The big alliances are pretty laid-back and accepting of various playstyles. If you don't like it, drop corp and try something else.   
---
As far as actually 'protecting' you, there's not really any available options for getting someone to watch over you while you mine. Alliances will have intel-channels to warm you of potential dangers.
---
Actually, it isn't
---
You just need to obey to state-enforced homosexuality, say PBUH in Reddit once a month and upvote Naz-al-ghul posts really
---
run, goons, run!
---
You literally just explained how ecm stops the Unique Selling Point of trig ships. All you've proven is why what I said is correct.
---
Exactly the right attitude!
---
So he could use them an infinite number of times?
---
was not so much about stopping damage although that was a nice side benefit.   It was breaking the logi chain of 10 plus dreks
---
Show me on this doll where nullsec touched you
---
Your troll reply is as old as your fucking garbage troll burned out shit mind. Try harder noob.

lol, your butthurt is pretty impressive, keep it coming!

You're yester- year bitch. Go back to high sec ganking with you 2m sp goon alts
---
Thanks that's a great idea. I almost glossed over weather. Rats I will have to familiarize myself with a bit more. Quick question. On rooms with a drifter bs do you kill it or the cruisers first?
---
I got the sarcasm :-D

got baited into playing this game

You're yester-year bitch? Ohh, I like that one.

By the way, my hisec ganking alt has 10mil SP thankyouverymuch.

---
Was WH-diving in my Cheetah and spotted a Retri on D-scan. Scanned down the only other hole and found the Retri 1,000 km away from it, flying away in a straight line. Then someone else warned me in local that there were others in-system wanting to kill me, so I jumped through that hole.
---
Dead end WH system. I jumped back and of course there's the Retri and the other chatter going "haha gg Rebas Kradd" in both local and email.
---
I cloak, dive straight down, miss the decloak by less than 100m, and GTHO back to high-sec.
---
They were in Horde.
---
Uh dude, the application nerf was fantastic. I dont get insta fragged by a capital in an AF now.
---
A scrammed and webbed battlecruiser being shot by LR Fibos &amp; Lights is going to die, and that's perfectly fine. He was hard tackled and a sitting duck. Now if he was going 3km/s and had a sig of 30 and got instafragged, that woulda been not fine.
---

like in the faction warfare faction chat. Or here I guess.
---
I did a buy for like 15b worth of navy boosters after some dude randomly asked in faction. That was a gigantic pita to haul but I made a few bil off it.
---
Just remember you're gonna pay a % tax to shift in bulk (they want to make a profit off you!). The more bulk the less % you can get away with paying.
---
Theyre already getting big investment isk.  You dont think the moguls arent all over this already?
---
Of course but they need trillions to get started.
---
We understand player concerns about titan powerlevel. Therefore, we will nerf Molok Lock range to 5km.

obviously not if they're looking to rent.

My source tells me that actually GOTG iniated the reset after NC showed up to shoot a fortizar in Fade a few days ago
---
They were nuetral but their renter Alliances were still blue and there must have been some agreements over sov/structures etc
---
over here if your car isn't taxed, it gets taken away.
---
did they live or were they kicked :thonkers:
---
they already sold, like they give a shit about that now.
---
I'm sure they will when the Korean overlords come looking for that ROI...
---
Looks like interesting times are on the way
---
Automated checking.
---
So you claimed nothing. You didnt actually post. Fine.
---
subcaps to 5 is the best skills. leave capital skills to alts.
---
Well...I think it's hard to control every single member in such a big alliance...I wouldn't jump to conclusion on the first incident. If it really is an alliance/corp-wide thing, I'll be the first to condemn them....
---
I don't know just about anything else in imaginary land because they aren't worth shit at 200km.
---
Thanks Wally, very cool. Culturally enriching the masses on the Widow, the best Black Ops Battleship is part of a well balanced KB. 
---
On a more serious note: Look how they massacred my girl. (Please unfuck the widow)
---
Excellent, thank you for the informed response.
---
So you live ten seconds instead of five? Great nerf.
---
&gt;He was hard tackled and a sitting duck.
---
How are you not a sitting duck when "hard tackled"?
---
How often does a BC go 3k/sec with a sig of 30? What are you nerfing damage for? Only frigs? The nerf is absolute horseshit and still encourages cap use. They need to lose 90% damage vs all subcaps.
---
Wally is a good man and the Widow is fantastic.
---
That would be a horrible gaming experience.....I mean for Mangoes
---
He clearly states Reddit has a massive number of people on it with different opinions, please pay attention.

autz doesn't exist, you're all abunch of liars who just like timezone tanking all your stuff so no one can shoot it, duh.

109k subbed. 1k on as I write this.

Confine them to a pvp arena. Caps are oppressive to content.

you should add : "multiple times"
---
No you just do them faster
---
Yea but are they all 10/20 ? ;-)
---
Yes thats right.
---
That's probably the most error-free sentence I've seen LS write.
---
No. You failed to understand balance and what the game needs. You like the "nerfs" because they dont actually fix anything. This is why the game is dying.
---
Might as well remove all ships except frigs and caps as everything else just gets instantly slaughtered by cancer.

Any time theres a frigate in the novice, theres a cloaked instalock arty loki 30km from the gate. Every goddamn time.

You wouldn't dare to say that in AU tz!

 Basicly all my solo experience has been bait after bait me prettending to be some idiot to get people to attack me then kill them.
---
Nah
---
If you set your plans on solo Hecate you'll find yourself doing a lot of min maxing.
---
You can go for the usual build like [this](https://i.imgur.com/GS0a0LF.png) wich pulls close to 900dps and is very nasty against frigates or other smal sized ships (obviously), against bigger targets like cruiser you can swap out a web for a Cap Injector and minmax the fitting to get the necessary space for a T2 Warpscrambler etc.
---
It shows 55mil for the Fit but actually its more expensive, calculate close to 90mil for Ammunition and Charges. You better use Sisters Scanner Probes since scaning with Combats on top of no scanboni at all really sucks ^(holy shit) and I have max scanning skills ffs. If you use some CPU / Powergrid Implants you can use a T2 Proble Launcher but keep the Sisters Probes, they're making the fit very expensive but are worth it tho.
---
You need 9 days for the Hecate but you **definitly** want T2 guns! So add them too.
---
Of course not. Lets just keep the oppressive bullshit.
---
Maybe it would be better if they couldnt do it?

This is the second thread now where you cried about imbalance cause you died to something cheesy. Perhaps EVE isn't for you.

&gt;A hard tackled, active tanked battlecruisergetting three shot by a supercarrier is oppressive how?
---
Because you will be "hard tackled" if you are fighting a bunch of frigs. If you are not willing to be caught, your only option is to not fight. You think that guy is gonna get another BC or similar and go out again? No. He either stops, or moves to another area, until the same thing happens again, at which point he probably gives up. You like that?
---
&gt;You're whining about shit you've probably died to in two threads, both replies to me, now, begging for a further nerf. I don't think EVE is the right game for you.

What? Dude's in a brawling Drekavac. Hard tackled means he's scrammed and webbed. He aint going nowhere.
---
&gt; You think that guy is gonna get another BC or similar and go out again? No. He either stops, or moves to another area, until the same thing happens again, at which point he probably gives up. 
---
Yes he will. Flower Fallen is a local of black rise and constantly roams there in various brawling ships. Most of his fights end in him escaping a subcap escalation or holding the grid. If you actually roamed in BR or watched any of his videos you'd know this. 
---
&gt;Your thinking appears to follow a pattern of never wanting to fix anything.

Since you're keen on following post histories, scroll down further and read through some of my r/eve posts regarding balance.
---
Could be, but there's a few copycats out there now, unless he recycles loki pilots.
---
Yeah my Widow has been collecting dust for like a year already. I had so much fun flying it before. Also it was super helpful in jamming tackle on a dumb-ass freighters and orcas

Good thing I learned is that ships will get the name of the saved fit if you use multifit to assemble and fit a new ship. That helps me from forgetting.

For 1/3rd of it's DPS, a carrier gets one overheated blackbird T2 multispec.
---
&gt;What? Dude's in a brawling Drekavac. Hard tackled means he's scrammed and webbed. He aint going nowhere.
---
Frigs are faster than a BC. That was true last time I checked. Can you figure out what that generally means in terms of tackling?
---
&gt;Yes he will. Flower Fallen is a local of black rise and constantly roams there in various brawling ships. Most of his fights end in him escaping a subcap escalation or holding the grid. If you actually roamed in BR or watched any of his videos you'd know this. 
---
So he is retarded enough to enjoy losing to uncounterable bullshit. Good for him.

I used to roam BR years ago. Havent been back since some idiot dropped a cap on me. While it isnt faster to self-destruct, it is more convenient.
---
&gt;Since you're keen on following post histories, scroll down further and read through some of my r/eve posts regarding balance.

Why would I do that? You clearly dont want to nerf caps, which together with injectors are the most broken things in the game.
---
Semi-n00b here. Is gatecamping really a fun way to play Eve? It sounds like it could get pretty boring because 1) a lot of idletime 2) fighting a lot of unfair fights against industrials. I guess I'm wrong or it wouldn't be so popular, but I haven't understood the appeal yet.
---
Also - I find that my explo Heron is really quick to warp away from gates. Is that a false sense of security?

Just PM me when you have applied and been accepted I wil get your stuff moved for you. Once you are accepted you can look at our forums for services offered and things like that

Yes, but even at the maximum possible material and time efficiencies, building a titan or super carrier takes a ton of time and resources
---
nah you're just wrong and dumb
---
This is the best eve scsm i have ever seen.

All null sec alliances have rental systems you can pay for. Though why would you as one person, you would not be able to drain a system's resources fast enough. If you did earn the rent for it, you would still leave millions of isk just sat on the table uncollected every month. 
---
Joining a corp will make you more money, then go into a partnership with two or three corp mates for a system.

Hi. Returning after a long time, and just wondering: how would I go about experiencing the game, as a new player, with a character that already has done the basic tutorials way back in the day, and has a bunch of skill points already in mining, salvaging, freighters, and stealth bombers. I only ever really trained up, spent most of my time ninja salvaging for a corp and mining in a retriever. I started a new character yesterday, and was being put through some kind of "Seeker" questline. I realised I wanted to use my old character, but wanted to be taught by the game first, using the updated quests/tutorials etc. Any ideas on what to do/where to go?
---
It's simple: Chinese feel Western rules don't apply to them. Also cheating is endemic in their society and is socially acceptable to cheat and bot in video games to get ahead. Same goes for schools, colleges and universities both in China and Chinese international students that come to the west to learn and get that bit of paper that's worth more than their local.
---
    
---
  
---
Yes these are gross generalizations however think of it like this: They skull fucked their own server to death via botting the fuck out of it. So much so that 1 month of sub time via plex is 20,000,000,000 isk (thats TWENTY BILLION). This botting went unchecked and accepted by the developer that hosted it there.
---
Also their current plan to move here explicitly states no botting or RMT. The simple fact that THAT HAD TO BE MENTIONED should raise concerns as anyone else coming over from another game to Eve or other community coming to Eve, botting and RMT wouldn't even be a thought, working out how to get to the top would be.
---
I expect a load of hate towards them and a very very rough start, regardless of whom they may befriend inititally, if anyone cossies up to them in the first place. Also having the odds stacked so far against them initially is ging to make retaining members tricky when Frat, PLA and other already established Chinese operations are in place with infrastructure, SRP and space already provided.
---
We are at the beginning of interesting times and I look forward to the chaos it causes as the games VERY fucking stale right now. I just hope they don't skull fuck our economy to the shit hole their server is currently in
---
Well either you wait and let your new toon train, or just straight up use your old character and have your new character train for a specific role.
---
Warped on some bait knowing it was bait with a tengu. Had a bunch of bros in basis, cerbs, and some other missle shield shit backing me up.
---
Bros jumped hole, came in and we killed like 4 bill in the skirmish. Only lost 1 tackle ceptor.
---
Tried puzzle rush chess? So addictive you may never play eve again.

The MTU may be full. It's not the TARDIS, it doesn't have unlimited space
---
How long where you exploring in null before you got all this haul? :D
---
got baited on a free rapier sitting on a gate. i was a fool to think he was afk.
---
No, most corps have their moons privately owned as they pay the alliance that own the space. And even then you would probably be selling the ore back to your corp anyway. PH has a great mining system setted up, you can mine at the public moon whenever you want with moons poping about every 1-3 days. (of course you can't mine in Nationalized moons or no rorquals in R64s, and it's subject to how many ore is left). Take as much adventage as possible
---
We were camping an ansiblex in frat space generally being a nuisance to people not watching intel. Killed several ships including a hull tanked bait cyno navy domi who we assume was told "no capital backup is coming to kill this destroyer group" or didn't have enough ozone in cargo. 
---
But then there was this nightmare. He jumped into our camp and was slowboating back to the gate stuck in a bubble. I was like "this is bait i should just warp off" but then FC tackled him so i was like ok whatever and then before i knew half of us were dead cus we didn't have eyes on the other side of the gate.
---
Hecate uses rail, not missiles

Umm don't? Like seriously you could make 100m an hour just salvaging after a super that is ratting in null

In regards to PI, how do you tell if it’s a “good” planet? I have moderate skills for PI but I honestly don’t take advantage of the skills (albeit a little counter intuitive) because I know that I don’t have a great understanding, even after watching YouTube vids detailing HOW to set up PI, I can’t figure out what makes a planet good.
---
If it’s far from base in bullseye, is it pretty normal to just station a jump clone in that area with a goo hauler and jump in every few weeks to drain them?
---
I fly a Gila, so I kill anything else that spawns first, so that my drones don't get shot at. While killing cruisers, I prioritize neuts, followed by webs, then tracking disruptors, and then everything else.
---
&gt;I have nothing more to say.
---
When has this ever been true of you?
---
This is indeed true and sometimes it worked and otehr times it fell apart for one reason or another, if I recal;l correctly. I could be wrong here but Grath can point it out.
---
The interesting thing is, PL right now is a shadow of it's former self, Hordes at war with Legacy from memory and NC just deployed somewhere that I'm not sure is confirmed yet. All signs are pointing to a big war heating up. Due to this, burrying the hatchet may be quite difficult when wounds and losses would not of had time to scab over, let alone heal. Not to mention Imperium and PanFam have a raging hate boner for eachother so unless they decide to have some serious hate sex to get it out of their systems then turn on PIBC, I don't see them getting too close

It's okay buddy, I suggested a lowsec gate to Stain exactly once in the past week.
---
Gate camping can be pretty boring sometimes but its also a lot of fun if you're getting decent content. I've only ever gate camped in nullsec so not a lot of industrials flying around our space. If you're camping with other people and you're on comms, you can be semi-paying attention and wake up when someone jumps through. It can also lead to some fun chases if someone manages to get away. The appeal is getting kills, plain and simple. 
---
Intsalockers + ships with high alpha + bubbles and your heron will be dead before you even know you're in trouble. When you jump through a gate, there's a "gate flash" on the other side right before you pop into system so the gate campers are always ready for you.
---
Obviously the social software they use is very different from us.
---
They use QQ for internal communication. There are still many public communities, such as Baidu tieba.
---
They use a dialogue software called YY. 
---
Of course, this is caused by the Chinese network blocking the community software we use.
---
Geo, your art is so good &lt;3
---
Ok, 3isk
---
I am sure they will not be in tama. Most people may not have an account yet.

Is the tengu efficiency（DPS） too low?

I accidentally pressed F1. :(
---
I heard that PLA offered them a couch in  Okkamon.
---
Popped a can worth 150,000,000 last night. Didn't even have to run home in fear because it was in my home system!
---
Honestly I did not even know those were actual animals. I allways thought of (these guys)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbX389CS0M8]. They are just too fitting for the usual fleetmember.
---
There is.
---
You are right

Don't die
---
&gt;I dont know much about serenity politics.
---
Proceeds to shit on everyone else
---
I have an active armor vni fitted with webs, scram and noses. Sometimes when I'm bored I go to one  nearby ratting systems, choose an easy anom and start ratting. I'm pretty shitty at solo pvp, but the engagements are petty straightforward: burn into the enemy ship, hit him with everything, change the drones to light. I've managed to pull it off several times, killing mainly assult frigates. My fit easily tanks 2 wolfs. I usually also have an alt in a griffin nearby just in case I come across something I can't handle.
---
People can look you up on zkillboard and see how you like to fit your ship if you've died in it. This has the biggest impact in wormholes due to the lack of a local chat list. But generally speaking, the less info you give to the people trying to kill you the better.
---
You'd be very restricted in a rattle because most l5s have capital neuts that hit to 250km, but a tengu could probably pull it off.
---
Its kind of not worth it though, its vastly inferior to running a carrier.
---
You CAN solo them in battleships, using very bespoke fits. I found very good success (400K lp per hour avg) running them in poverty-spec t1 battleships.
---
I dont want to give too much info though, do your own research on Sisi - i had a lot of fun learning "secrets" based on scraps of info and my own tests

What's wrong about eradicating alcohol?
---
Any ratting carrier with hyperspatial rigs (fast in, fast out)... Also, the trick is to decline the bad and only run the good L5 missions.
---
I don't know, I left there 5 years ago. I only know that after the agent's contract expires, the CCP sells the agent to another company. Re-approval as required by law, but now indefinitely extended. This means they can't play the game on serenity server.
---
You need to make your company more attractive for your new investors by trimming the fat
---
underrated post
---
There was this whole casino thing awhile back......
---
Awsome more bot kill mails I wont say no to that
---
Botting isn't a chinese only problem so I doN't realy accept it as an argument here. Sure they probably bot more then us on TQ but they have less wars too so they don't have anything else to do besides krabbing.
---
Literally every entitiy on TQ would do the same as PIBC on Serenity if they would knew 100% they would win. When NC/PL were the powerhouse of TQ with a massive scap advantage they blobbed everyone with it and denied content because they could do it. Goons right now could maybe do it if they would be sure that not every other alliance would come together again to fight them off. It is just that people want to win so you can't realy blame PIBC for winning.
---
I'm saying that the PLEX price on serenity was 10x higher than TQ BECAUSE of more cheaters on serenity.
---
They won't
---
Can we keep him?
---
Can be boring for sure. Depends on gate, time zone and who you camp with. Yes you are hitting a lot of industrials, but some of them will be hauling valuable shit. It's just being a pirate at the end of the day.
---
Looks like the NPC did the heavy lifting.
---
My earliest experiences were very unlike this. Mostly I got blown up before I even knew what had happened.
---
A few months into the game, I had wandered into lowsec on a mission and got blown up by a frigate gang in Ishomilken. The FC was really cool, answered all my questions about what I did wrong and how I could get to be good at PvP. Those guys were the core of Stay Frosty, and became my home and family in Eve for the next five years or so. If I ever come back to the game, it'll be right back to them.

Probably set up by random audience members to farm those raider points in order to get free shit without actually watching.
---
A trick I would use is to find a tower of the local corp. Check their killboard, and name my ship for someone moderately active.
---
First, decide what you want to harvest from the planet. 
---
Then, check if the planet has a group of all the things you need, in high concentration, and close together. If it does, it’s good. If not, it’s bad
---
Well, according the this recent report from MIT Tech Review Putin wants it. And they have a law and a big technology project in place to make it happen.
---
I started mining anomaly ores and my corp doesn't have a buyback. Should I compress and sell the ore or get a corpmate with max refine to refine it for free then sell minerals? I can sell the compressed ores quite easily but I don't know if i'm losing out on a lot of isk by not refining and selling.
---
Why are Fullerides so expensive in taxes when creating them from moon goo? I pay almost twice as much tax as I do on metamaterials, and Fullerides have half the sell value.
---
I don't think the problem lies in the cheaters. Garbage does not distinguish national boundaries, and the difference is in attitude with the cheaters. 
---
Serenity is more like an illegitimate child. The CCP only cares if they profit from the agency. The lowest level of management leads to social unrest. 
---
I have experienced both sides. Believe me, society operates by system and law.
---
Pandemic Horde has a lot of moons because we own a lot of space. If you join another major nullsec alliance then they’ll have similar numbers. If you join some tiny lowsec/wh alliance they won’t have anywhere near as much
---
Wow it took one spit of logic and you instantly deteriorated to diversions, that's actually impressive.
---
Pretty sure this is a test and they’re trying to set it up so that they can do it if they choose to in the event of a crisis. Even China is unable to be disconnected from the global internet on a day to day basis due to it being a necessity for global corporations, which this article also delves into... that’s why we have FRT and PIBC (soontm)
---
I was watching this guys stream last night thanks for the warning
---
Rattle is the best thing for it short of a carrier, you go full regen fit with refits for damage depending on the amount of damage you’re taking
---
That's the point though, it has exactly 27k m³ space, and I am trying to fill it to capacity. So say it's 24,353.7m³ full, if I jettison exactly 2,646.3m³ (which would total exactly 27k m³), it still won't take it in, but I'm not able to figure out what makes that happen. Like I said, with full numbers, like 23k m³ + jettison 4k m³, it'll work just fine.

Seriously, i appreciate pointing that out because it is not my intention to do RMT. With that being said, i already removed the x2 points gains for subs and 3k pts for donos or cheers. Thank you again for bringing this up.
---
Will you guys together with all your keyboard warriors watch and support me later? :) Please dont be shy to click the follow and sub buttons. Thanks guys!
---
Also, for the other guy who suddenly joined our small alliance way back in DIP and wanted to be this and that the amazing intel go to guy?  try harder. Reason why i was not banned is simple, i didnt bot , never did and never scammed a friend. Again, try harder. You claim or wanna-be the intel guy but your claims and intel were (probably still are) all messed up. You cant stand someone telling you NO? Try again, harder. Lmao.

I was just casually mining in my defenseless procurer when suddenly a Tengu decloaks on me. I was trying to beat it off myself for a while, but no success so I had to call in the murderbeans.

This is what snuff/PM used to use back when people actually did them, dualboxing is pref . You refit the lows based on how much damage you’re taking with a mobile depot in the site, you’re meant to be 0 cap the booster is only there for you to MJD if you need to GTFO. You can also have the MJD/Booster in your cargo and have more tank so you can have more dps lows... you need to refit hardeners (and drones) for specific rat types.

Rat Wreck with Dark Blood Module and T2 Implant in it :)
---
Im sorry Welstiel but where is your proof that Ray scammed people? If you have it, by all means show it to me. All I have seen is accusations. No chat log, wallet screenshots showing payment etc. Just logs of you two fighting constantly because you two clearly dont get along.
---
As I have stated previously, being a member of his corp, I never noticed or had any reason to suspect Ray was scamming people other then some that had Chuts approval because spies or something.
---
And frankly, as a person who mined with him constantly, the botting accusations are false. I never once seen signs of him botting. Warping together, pulling drones at the same time etc. Just a guy who mines all the dang time because he works at home.
---
Im sure ill be accused of white knighting, but my from my observations as a member of his corp, and one who played with him on the regular, i have not seen or observed anything to suspect he was doing something nefarious.
---
I cant speak for the twitch aspect. I dont know twitch rules and have only managed to stop by his stream a few times.

Interesting news. The Chinese in the wall secretly came out, and Russia outside the wall wanted to go in.
---
No, as I understand it its one of their strategic goals. I think the seriousness is underlined by them issuing a law for the whole thing. Something you would not need if its "only a test".
---
You are technically correct that businesses in China still have access to the global Internet. But all traffic is fully controlled and subject to censure. Unwanted sited like Facebook and Google are blocked completely. And they have an off switch.
---
shut up idiot
---
Most likely a shitpost pripaganda, trying to drive a wedge between allies.
---
Even though i will get negative karma with this post, let me tell you something:
---
The only thing you have done with this post, is to promote his stream, and actually, thats kinda a nice thing. I've been watching his stream for a week now, and to be honest, i didn't even notice the rmt with his "Raider Points", cause i didn't even have a look at it.
---
What i can tell you so far: As soon as he noticed it was illegal to do so, he imediatly changed the shop, so there is no chance to exchange real money to his currency. And within the week i have been watching, not a single person exchanged real money to his raider points. The only thing thats left, is his loyality system, which is, as far as i can tell, not illegal.
---
I don't know his background, and to be honest, i do not care. All of us have done something bad, and are not in the position of blaming someone for his past.
---
His content is chill, and thats what i have been looking for.
---
Feel free to join the stream and drop a follow. As many of you guys have already done last night.
---
That's a really weird interaction. Are you sure you had exactly that much Veldspar? Because each unit is 0.10m3, so maybe you had an extra 0.4m3 in one stack, and/or an extra 0.3m3 in the other one.
---
They deserve to be scammed, tbf. Why the fuck would you donate to a wanker who streams... mining?
---
If they wanted more content, it should have happened long ago: eh? :thonks

But CCP is to blame in this situation in my opinion. It is not hard to monitor these big groups of bots and ban them. But they don't seem to do anything with reports. And the bots I have reported many months ago are still active. The moment you enter system. 6 vni's warp to a post at the same time and orbit it. That's a couple system in close proximity all same thing.
---
Why do you posttwo times with the same account, one time talking about the streamer in third person and one time, this one, as if you were the streamer?
---
Btw, screenshotted both just to be sure, /u/Havoc_ambro.
---
Well, fucking undock it and see it in full.
---
The way I read it and other articles on the same topic it seems to me that they want to have the option to have a closed internet for future strategic purposes. Such as if the EU/US slapped further sanctions on them. I don’t think that this will be something that they have turned on on a day to day basis as long as the current geopolitical situation remains stable. But that’s just my perception of it I could be wrong.
---
The hero we do not deserve. :(

Maybe if panfam didn't actively hunt test the past God knows how many years. Things would be different.

What    do you mean more story? It is the same story, just different year.  Everything's the same just the names of the egos involved.
---
Well, FRT run quite a lot if bits you know.

They’d like too, but government is way too corrupt, I guess it would fail as miserably as all big Putin’s projects.

Why use a disposable paper plate?
---
I thought that was the case, but it started happening a bunch of times and I actually pulled out a calculator and redid the calculation some 4 or 5 times to make sure. I am a hundred percent certain that at least twice, it happened with the correct amounts. Plus some two or three times where I can't guarantee it because I didn't check my math as rigorously on those. I even made sure that Veldspar was the ONLY thing in the jetcan and the MTU, because the first time it happened I had Scordite in the MTU as well and thought maybe the invisible .05m³ was responsible for it.

As I understand it's more that the government wants to shutdown a country and create a blackout in times of crisis.
---
Just imagine Tiananmen Square today, rather than the late 80s. You might see live streaming of armoured personnel carriers running over protestors, squishing them, and animated .gifs on Imgur of the army hosing the human sludge down drains. Instead we just have a few photos of an accountant standing in front of a tank and a few angry students.
---
Those hours and days during the moments of a crisis are crucial and a government/regime wants complete control to do what it needs to keep power and it's people/outside world in the dark.

I haven't seen hate towards tye new Chinese players anywhere on this sub, unless you look at it through a SJW's dillusional eyes.
---
There is a concern, not hate. Cancerous behavior that ran rampant killed the Chinese server. These are the facts and we are discussing facts here.
---
There is botting on TQ, but it is nowhere near the levels out there on Serenity. FACTS dictate that.
---
are you sure? i'd think the drones would get destroyed, but I may be wrong.
---
Well in that case I got nothing, haha. Chalk it up to CCP_round() I guess. Sometimes when fitting ships that have exactly 0 PG or CPU left, the fit will work, other times it won't let you online a  module and it may depend on the order in which you online them etc.

You misunderstood the article. Russia just wants to build infrastructure close to what China has at the moment. It doesn't mean that they'll completely disconnect from the internet and live on their own, but if a future situation requires them to, they could disconnect if they wanted after this project is finished because they have all the infrastructure required to do so. They mostly just want to control the flow of information like China.
---
Well, and how does 20-&gt;5sec cycle changes that?
---
well, since no one else is offering. you like high end exploring in null? come join a nullsec corp and do all that under the security of a supercar umbrella.
---
just so you know, south is better.
---
pm for info as to which alliances to join

idk, this kind of reminds me of SOMERBlink…
---
Some of the most fun i had in this expedition is being chased by guy. The best part is that i can't be sure i was chased, i just know that he went to the same system as me a couple of times
---
U06àà
---
Maybe one day. My current pc would explode if i turned obs on while in game. But im getting a new one later this year.
---
3 of the biggest Titan fights ever happened 8 months ago and you post that lmao.
---
oh man, nice! In pre-alpha/omega days with 14 day trials and 700mil plex you could explo your way to a plex in a lil less than a week of null exploration
---
 To this day its my favorite way of starting an alt
---
Corms? MOA is hibernated, there are no corms anymore.
---
those numbers seem off.
---
With skills at V and no implant, I have double that value when I simulate the bpo(2266 days).
---
Now if I had a sotiyo (-30%) and its t2 rig in wh (-50.4%), as well as an rr-605 and my-705 (-5%) this means 33% of the original time. So actually 2years and 18 days to research from 0/0 to 10/0 (same from 0/0 to 0/20)
---
No, I think you missed the main point. Its not about physical disconnection, but about Russia controlling access to cloud based services like Eve Online which are hosted outside Russia. In China CCP had to run a separate server in order to comply with government regulations. The very same thing might happen in Russia.
---
My current tactic of running whenever i see someone enter a system held up this time. But i probably need some better tactics if i encounter an experienced hunter
---
It's not everyone's native language and it ain't that bad, if that's all you have to say :thumbsup:
---
Thanks! I'll do that as soon i can
---
Thank you! I had someone introduce me to how the game works, so it's not a fair comparison.
---
Heh, thanks
---
Warped a 60 man ceptor fleet to a maller at 0.
---
Realized a nanosecond later after hitting warp fleet the fuckup I had just committed. 
---
Pretend like everything is fine in warp. 
---
Everyone died.
---
You want an eve related or non-eve related answer?
---
Wow, i have a lot of work to so before i reach the stage where i can collect that much money. And we don't talk about time, but i was there for more then 3 hours getting used to the hacking mini-game
---
So as an Alpha you can train 5 million skill points. I want to ask, do all Alpha available skills fit within the 5mill limit?
---
NCS2 is an awesome QOL mod in general. They are really on the ball with updating it to, always has new features every time i start a new game.
---
Also a fan of strike cruisers, for when you absolutely have to crush the enemy fleet!
---
Or a curse.
---
I can at least burn away from a curse. Loki just instafrags ya :D
---
I hope so, I don't plan on stopping with this game anytime soon
---
I stopped counting after 4 hours ;). But most of it was running and hiding from other players
---
True )
---
I looked into it, and it's still possible. It just requires more time. Maybe I'll start getting enough in a month one day
---
I had someone PM me with an offer. But I'm in a corp with the guy who helped me get into the game. I just don't feel like joining a different corp. yet. But thanks for the offer!
---
In case your nc 3lit3 status killed half your brain... this is a meme.
---
It's a meme? Havoc is the original dude who told r/eve about this rmt botting idiot.
---
MJDs broke a lot of these missions in the players favour.
---
I'd gotten into a fight on a station in my Oracle, vs a Cyclone.
---
Unfortunately for me he'd found the opportunity to refit to scram and EM resists and caught me in close quarters :(
---
...But unfortunately for him, my fit was plated with scram/web and ion blasters 😎
---
Bot against bot ;D not easy imo.
---
I've gotten the points for free from watching, redeemed items, and he's sent them to me. Never gave him real monies. How's this Rmt? 
---
Only cash he's gaining is from twitch revenue which is separate from Eve.
---
I can read and speak quite a lot of mandarin, so it will be good for me
---
I've attacked a bait titan
---
Oof
---
Set up by him in order to get enough viewers to get that ad revenue.
---
pvp happened
---
/u/chimel , I strongly suggest you to read this one. It's as close to a perfect explanation what EVE really is as possible.
---
Yeah, EVE is a strong, independent game that don't need no new players.
---
How have you coped with being braindead enough to the point where you actually enjoy watching a stream of someone mining in highsec?
---
I would not worry about null. I d look for a corp with moon mining athanors eventually aim to anchor your own. In hi sec or wormhole space. By joining a corp you pay taxes but you wont get protected, literally nobody will give 2 shits about you in the blocs unless you are flying a rorqual.
---
They do not. You can get more than 5 mil as an alpha by using injectors, you just can't naturally train skills for free beyond that point.
---
Thanks mate &lt;3 I want to get much better though, and more consistent!
---
out of the loop what happened?
---
Covert ops cloak or the recon cruisers that dont show up on d scan like the rook
---
No need, you can train an alpha catalyst and gank for free.
---
Same with this Guy:  [https://www.twitch.tv/roonet](https://www.twitch.tv/roonet)   
---
giveaways only for follower and if you talk alot in the chat you have higer chances... ;-)  
---
Seems like a good way to get partnered.
---
He is the military leader of a major supercap force. And who are you really?
---
This 100%.
---
 No nloc should have to do ccps job. We try to get renters that bot out but the issue is many things. 
---
First its renter space why would you go there? Why the fuck would test just be in KWG space? 
---
Second you dont see the bot since you are blue. Usually bots fuck off when a neut comes in . A nlue guy isnt gonna trip an alarm
---
Third you find them kick and mass report. In the time waiting for CCP to get the ticket the toon is skill exstracted into a new toon in ways they cant trace easily. 
---
They join a diffrent corp or new renter alliance all togethers.
---
I'd just go read the other like 5 posts a day about this same thing. Should find some answers there.
---
I love how you post your irrelevant shit and then reply to every single comment that points out how irrelevant it is. Oh what a great and charismatic leader you are.
---
Confirmed.
---
U should aply.
---
it's literally free so the only thing you will waste is your time
---
&gt; I see many people complaining about current state of eve
---
true, nothing changed since 2003
---
Talk to him about moving the whole corp to null, thats how I moved out  there, ou entire corp left highsec to make better use in null. It's very satisfying to be able to mine and build a carrier or a dread by yourself
---
&gt; GoTG
---
&gt; Imperium renters
---
Haven't played since Imperial Legacy was still a thing, am confused as fuck
---
Hate weebs like you, i dont know something so ill just bother other people to do it for me for free. Its not 2005, there is shittons of info online, if you dont want to waste YOUR time and search it yourself - bounce.

Imho CCP tried to shut Brisc Rubal up over his criticism of handling of plex prices and general stuff ups..
---
I'm not feeling the game, inflation has skyrocketed so I have no money to do daily PVP and I don't give  a shit about making money.
---
That's just my feel of the game.
---
VPN  
---
China is doing same and we have chinese players
---
do in a orca ;P
---
Gotg have been on the side of test for sometime

In lowsec and other timers they have been fighting with goons

Goons hiroshim-ed their ass enough that they now like goons

Sorry bro we were on patrol against pirates. :) If you noticed my Brutix were shooting tiny little itty bitty guns vs frigs. Made the clip later when I found out you were streaming.  gf though.
---
can confirm i saluted him
---
(my post)
---
Because that's how Goonswarm started as well. And look at them now.
---
These pilots have been flying Titans like they are cruisers for years, they're not some newbie organisation.
---
Beyond that, they have skill injectors, Plex, and they're certain to find support from existing TQ blocs trying to make them friendly. They won't be in low-sec for long.
---
AoM are shaping up to the biggest disruption that TQ has seen in a very, very long time. And nobody knows what their intentions are. That's why a lot of people are super cautious about them.
---
 Everything you said I have heard before, yet western players have been a bigger problem for me then the Chinese ones
---
I have too much shit to deal with in my real life to keep on top of all the memes the kids use these day
---
SOE dread someday
---
As someone who ganks autopilots, me too
---
They will just bend the knee to Mittens and join the Imperium. The question really is, will Goons come and save them.
---
Well that would be obvious due to the massive amount of western players on a western server vs low number of Chinese present by comparison. Simple numbers and math. If I was on serenity I would be saying it’s the Chinese fucking it up not the westerners because of the numbers disparity
---
Unpopular opinion: xenophobia. No amount of explanation can dissuade the Western predisposition that Chinese players have some things against the rules as the reputation has been ruined during the earlier days of Chinese gaming. Not that some Chinese players won't break rules --- some of them certainly do --- but a foreign body of players, with distinct culture and more importantly, language, is quite a catalyst to bring out the xenophobic sense of threat. 
---
It certainly doesn't help that the real-life rivalry between China and the West is intensifying. It always strikes me as weird as people in the West often slip some ideas that they would never say for other nations/ethnic group but will for Chinese/Russians. Remember how people said the Russians were the primary botters when CCP said most of the bots have an IP in the US? Yeah...
---
I thought linking this site on r/eve was banned
---
Go to sansha or guristaa nullsec. It will be 400m not 40m for the same time.

your orcale was fit with Ion Blasters..
---
After a longer break i got back in the game. Time before i played two weeks.  
---
I had enought money to buy me a rupture and do belt ratting. Didnt have enought cargo so i warped to station and warped back.   
---
There was a friendly guy talking in local the he took my loot and brought it to the warpin that i dont need to burn.  
---
Yes and then i exploded.

fuck thats going to be a hard sell to the wife...

I like chinese,

They only come up to you knees,  
---
Yet they're always friendly and they're ready to to please.  
---
There's nine hundred million of them in the world today,  
---
You'd better learn to like them, that's what I say.
---
perhaps its finally time to take our hats and play a different game.

i mean, by this time we are long out of straws to hold on to
---
Cringe.
---
Welcome to eve 2019
---
no, I made this :)
---
You're right, the numbers listed on that site are unbonused, in hindsight I should have mentioned that.
---
Cutting off? Really? Great Joke. Nobody don't want read text of this law.
---
That is probably because of where you are doing the reacting. Any manufacturing cost is a function of how much manufacturing is being done in that system. For example building things in Perimeter will cost significantly more the building them in some backwater HS, even if the inputs are otherwise identical.
---
If you refine them they will be significantly more difficult to move, but there is likely some value being added by refining them. The best way to know for certain is to setup a spreadsheet and do the math.
---
It sounds like a result of CCP\_round. Though the exact reason is unknown, EVE's rounding function can misbehave at times, for no apparent reason. There isn't much you can do about it besides submitting a bug report and moving on.
---
You have to add him as a contact and note him. There's a dude called 'stork' around black rise that does it exactly this way.
---
Aside from just looking for the materials you need there isn't a great method. IT should be noted though that LS planets are better the HS planets, and WH/NS planets are even better. If you want to make significant ISK through PI you either need to buy T2/3 goods and turn them into T4 goods, or do PI outside of HS.
---
yeah im sure i used to run them quite a bit
---
There is about 20mil SP usable by alphas, but after you hit 5 mil you either need to use injectors or temporally upgrade to omega.
---
Here is my take on it - Goons kicked our ass fair and square, props and respect to them for it - Our supposed "Allies" sent Pandemic Horde, paid Black Legion and paid Marshy to kick us while we are down straight after the war ended (which they failed at other than blapping a few rorqs while our USTZ was weak) 
---
NC said they were more like "NATO" and did nothing to help or stop it, we go to do the same thing to horde a few months later and you have a NC super fleet trying to catch our move op, and have helped on multiple timers, and to top it all off they came to shoot structures in our home territory (which kicked off this full renters and things reset)
---
Im already looking forward to Goons/TEST being better bluetrals (well maybe nuet-reds?) than Panfam ever was
---
NA/EU doesn’t get attention. Lel.
---
Come to AUTZ and have every single roam cut in the middle due to downtime and have latency so bad you have to pilot 2 seconds ahead and come back and talk to me.
---
You say "hiroshima-ed" like if Goons showed up on your door step with their super fleet you could do anything but "NCDock".
---
Nice :) good score!
---
My first time in a WH years ago, I knew to spam the D-scan for baddies sneaking up on me.
---
There I was, mining (yes, mining) my own business, when suddenly, 20km away the D scan showed a new name. It properly scared me and had my hands shaking.
---
The name of the ship: "Boo!"
---
Serenity is literally a completely different game.  A good comparison is actual WOW vs. a private server.  Blizzard / CCP runs WOW / Eveonline.  A bunch of randos run the private server / serenity.
---
No.
---
Maybe.
---
Guide from 3 years ago -&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3f3ed6/level_5_mission_guide/
---
Lol if this is true NC. could be in poo. Whilst they are off pretending to save renters (not really trying) from goon sigs. Ranger and Siberian could destroy Tenal. Init and Snuff shooting them from lowesc. Goons send those titans North and shoot those Tribute structures for glorious KM's please...……….
---
I think your looking at it from inside of the EVE box of knowledge. If you had zero idea of what EVE is and came to a stream of someone mining and started asking questions about the game.... if the streamer is a good enough influencer they can covert that viewer to trying out the game.
---
How would I know? I've done it for many years...
---
But do you got your nullsec mining permit
---
doesn't mean it wasn't a repost
---
Maybe you just didn't try ~enough~ alcohol....
---
&gt; Ranger and Siberian could destroy Tenal
---
the problem with this logic is assuming that ranger regiment and siberian squads give a fuck about anything that isn't dank ticks
---
they fucking don't
---
that's the reason there's a problem between gotg and panfam - most of gotg dgaf about problems that aren't their immediate problems, and couldn't be bothered to deploy or help out their coalition
---
anyone swallowing the goon kool-aid of "panfam shouldn't have turned their backs on gotg, they were the only way to compete with us" is an actual idiot. the MER numbers are meaningless when half the isk they make in branch goes to RMT anyway, and even if it didn't, ranger regiment and siberian squads were never going to spend that money or risk any assets helping anyone out other than themselves
---
They are superior gas Huffers for group huffing. Less squishy than ventures
---
I appreciate not one aspect of Eve, but all of them so far, (null/pvp) not as of yet. I'm a miner at heart and as looked down upon as it may be to some, I have managed to find a Corp and now great group of friends. So thank you Singularity Industries o7 I wouldn't be here without you.
---
And the differentiation between ab and mwd
---
This suggestion just makes stuff more complicated than needed, i dont want the t2 industry experience while piloting my ship in space
---
Agree. Get goon caps north and steamroll those bitches assets.
---
Back when I used to smartbomb rat (before they nerfed the mach) I got it down so I could clear a rock haven every 3.5 minutes, warp to warp. It wasn't worth checking the faction spawns since most of the time you made more by continuing to rat vs. looting. Plus it was fun watching the newbee following me around in a salvage ship  get excited when there was a good drop.
---
I assume it is similar with ratting titans.
---
Ah yes, the KOS checker. An app so good CVA had to set my main personally red because the KOS checker kept pulling stats of a biomassed character with the same name and I always shittalked their leadership about it...
---
&gt;Maybe the doughnut will be shaken up!
---
not with the current citadel sov meta without considerable effort which will inevitably lead to burnout
---
The one guarantee, there will be many, many bots.
---
Just wait until to crack open that one can that's worth a couple hundred million on its own. It's an awesome feeling, and a terrifying one when you realize it's not over yet! You still have to get that all home safely!
---
Ah yes, blowing up someones' car doesn't give you a suspect timer, but picking through it and picking up the undamaged parts does!
---
they can already do this, the act of looting doesn't break session change invulnerability
---
gg glhf in EVE
---
Because he's trading something he makes money from (your views) for in-game items, therefore indirectly trading in game items for money.
---
It's RMT.
---
Thats just not true. Darks are great for the extra speed, but your enemies have the extra speed as well. 
---
They are amazing for missile ships, not so great for turret or drone boats.
---
Ha, you think the Chinese aren’t capable of considerable effort? I get the feeling we’re going to be shown what true eve autists are capable of
---
I almost bought all of those bpcs of contracts few years ago. They seemed cheap for capital bpcs and thought I could monopolize the market. Then I found out there is no market. Seriously happy I did checkout instead of impulse buy..
---
I see people running them in dual ravens and barghest and whatnot, but I don't think you can just use a single box
---
Fuck your blue donut, thats what happened
---
it's less 'considerable effort' and more like 'months of sitting and waiting'
---
the real question is are you mad bro? Because you seem mad.
---
So you’re saying if I crash my corolla into a Ferrari I can keep the engine as long as I chainsaw it off before anybody notices?
---
Yeah, as far as I can tell, capitals are usually traded privately. Alliances that field capitals gather enough people who can make them to satisfy their demand, and I have no idea where solo pilots get them from unless they're somehow shipping them out of Jita.
---
Pleasee mittens, GOTG will probably even give us a keepstar to stage out of right next door too.
---
Oh boi i need your logins
---
Too many blues is what killed serenity. Not bots.
---
You mean many *more* bots
---
Bots watching bots watching bots mining rocks in a MMO spaceship game.
---
Kill this gay earth please.
---
Heh I meant the capital relic rig bpc :) No one is ever going to buy those even if people produce them.
---
Not sure if your reply was question but solo pilots can buy capitals from many places in low sec and npc null. For super capitals you got few keepstars in low sec.
---
Impersonation is forbidden under game rules though. I have no idea if this falls under it, but still.
---
He's also just a random dude that plays space pixels and pretend politics. In reality, we're all nobodies.
---
Well, the legends say that botters got banned there, botters started a lawsuit because the ban damaged their RMT business, lawsuit decided that botters shall not be banned.
---
Please stop posting.
---
Nope, gambling is against the rules even with only ingame assets involved (see evebet)
---
How do marauders fair?   Could a guy manage ok in an MJD Golem or something?
---
interesting. i use wechat. i wonder if they have any wechat groups i could join?
---
One of the missile stats used to determine it's application is explosion velocity. So if you have poor skills because you just joined the game and almost no missile support skills your dps is going to be low and you are going to get reduced application against the really fast ships.
---
Your capacitor is empty. Your capacitor, your capacitor your capacitor is empty. 
---
Seriously, the neuting towers are what kills people.
---
That sounds more reasonable, like there was a rule, then the law dictated the rule be changed.
---
At least we know we wont suffer that particular fate.
---
yea guys cause there's TOTALLY NOT A SHIT TON OF BOTS NOW RIGHT
---
&gt; Instead we just have a few photos of an accountant standing in front of a tank and a few angry students.
---
Whislt I agree with the sentiment we have far more than that, there are photos and a little footage from the massacre itself and many photos of the aftermath, very NSFW.
---
True to an extent. You can mitigate that if you use rapid lights and if you have the missile supports to 3-4 you should be fine.
---
The main issue is that the in-game items are not being delivered. The RMT is a very grey area. Yesterday, in the aftermath of the previous thread and in a clear moment of panic, he started giving away redeemed items live on stream to viewers. So now it looks like if you become his buddy you have a better chance to get your stuff.
---
Another thing I noticed is that he had to restart his router at some point because his stream was lagging, and the viewer count immediately dropped by more than 100 viewers.
---
Why is that?
---
You can buy an item called plex to pay for a 30 day omega time on the in game store it will cost between 1.7-2.0 billion a month to pay with in game money but the game is still completely enjoyable as an alpha you can fly up to battleships for all races but no capital ships or ore barges command ships or exhumers this only means you can’t mine for long periods alone but fleets are the best way to play even as alpha
---
You only get to deal damage on terms that the opponents can defend. So the only option is to make the game so unfun that they don't have the will to come defend.
---
&gt; And is there any other way to pay Omega instead of using actual money, like in-game currency?
---
Yes you can but I don't recommend you to do so, I used to do it that way and I was every month stressed to get enough money to buy my plex, it was hours waste for money and money waste for plex, right now I'm finally independent in life and I can afford 5x sub per month, I do log less to do that stupid "need x hours to plex my account" but when I log I can use that money to do pvp etc
---
&gt;if you have the missile supports to 3-4 you should be fine.
---
You won't if you just started.
---
There are lots of ways to have fun playing as an Alpha but I find that I get frustrated because I am very used to playing Omega so the hulls and fits that you're restricted to will limit some of what you can do.  
---
People do exploration as an Alpha, ratting/missions in VNIs.    FW is done in frigates/destroyers lots so there may be opportunity for Alpha accounts there.   FW is great for learning PvP, especially solo, small-gang and frig/cruiser piloting.  
---
As for paying for Omega time with ISK, it can be done but the game becomes a lot less fun when your only focus is earning the 2+B isk needed to pay for a sub each month.  
---
Frigates are cheap and fun, and a great place to start.
---
Honestly the only danger im seeing in this is them blueing the dinobees to form a PIBC 2.0 but after goons pulled back from the north last year instead of roflstomping gotg out of existence (anyone who thinks that was because of the faction citadels must be naive after looking at 1DQ) heres me hoping they're not stupid enough to drain the game of content. Maybe the Mangos just join Winter Co since they already got a bunch of friends there.
---
...effectively these guys have experienced a full monopoly on nullsec in Serenity, which maybe their dedication to break out in tranq could change that, or not.
---
Why don't you explore in wormholes? I think it's a lot safer if you stay vigil, also as an alpha with t1 frigate
---
actually if you kill NPCs in someone else's mission in highsec the wrecks will be yellow.
---
Seriously failing to see where the "funny" part would be in that scenario.
---
I think so, at least for long enough that you'll know whether you want to upgrade to Omega. The things they lock away aren't especially different than the Alpha content, it just a more specialized role that what you get as Alpha.
---
I was a subscriber for years and have let my account go to Alpha. I still enjoy hopping on and running around in my expendable ships. I can no longer fly my interdictor or my mining barges but to be honest I don't miss either. Jump into a Corp and fly safe. There is strength and fun to be had in a group.
---
So China is in and Russia is out soon..hmmmm
---
Sorry, not sorry, but if you werent playing during 2005-2008, you were simply too late. Game's utterly gone to shit, due to both the players *and* the developers.
---
I didn't want to go all out on my first expedition. I will start exploring them soon, thanks for the suggestion!
---
I never undock. I run the station.
---
Don't lie to the man, 2b+ and rising.
---
no blob will be shaken up. There is no space to take without getting a thumbs up from Goons, PANFAM or Test
---
Autopiloted Rhea.
---
Don't forget the alliances you call 'supposed allies' helped defend you for that entire war, even putting their super fleets at risk to defend you until Sort made deals to save his alliance while leaving all your 'allies' vulnerable.
---
The truth is you got your ass kicked then betrayed your friends. Those ex friends went for some payback and instead of just standing on your own two feet for once you have gone running under goons/test skirts. You actually had a chance to try and be a respectable coalition for once and fucked it alrdy.
---
As someone who ate a cornish pasty for lunch, I exhaled through my nose.
---
Again, I do all my reactions in the same system..  stuff that has 2.5 times the value on market is 30% of the tax. It doesn't add up.
---
&gt;Remember when Horde and BL were fighting GOTG NC was having a bit of a hissy fit over it?
---
Horde showed up when NC. did stuff, GOTG refused because they didn't want to be on the same grid as Horde. In the end you choose the ones that help you out, not your old friend that hasn't done anything for you in a long time.
---
Vote Reggie for CSM, I eat taco Bell. Favorite items are the crunch wrap supreme and the empañadas when they're hot
---
Generally the Nidhoggur and Thanatos are better at ratting due to their damage bonuses.
---
Well shit time to buy rorqual alts off a goon
---
I’ve had mixed success exploring in null the risk/reward is super fun though. Getting in, hacking, and getting out is kind of a rush.
---
Thats like 4 days training max. I wouldnt suggest any person thats less than a week or so old going into abyss anyway.
---
The golden rule: you get what you pay for. Just remember that. Treat alpha as a trial. It's fine in the short run, but you will likely feel limited in the long run.
---
Oh, sorry, I got my threads mixed up, I'm in a handful of conversations about various capital stuff right now. I don't fly r make capitals, so I have no idea how I got here. I occasionally see these T2 Capital explo rigs going for their salvage value, but I think that's the only market for them. It's an Eve goal of mine to fly an explo carrier into Sansha null and pretend it's a really big frigate, but will probably be a few years before I can do that.
---
2 people. Multi boxing 20 of ‘em.
---
Believe it or not, once you get used to them holes are much safer.
---
Once I was roaming down the chain in my shiny BS, got baited on a neutral drake doing anom and as the result dumpstered by fairly large T3 fleet.
---
So now Putin wants to ban memes too? At least he has a decent plan
---
i dont think a battle among eachother will make the game attractive to new players given the chinese national pride. but thats just my 2 cents anyway.
---
The guy basically said ohh someone spent time on researching this and now im not gonna do any research im just gonna post on reddit and get it for granted. Fuck yeah. Thats how you do business. Wouldnt have said anything if he was like guys im trying but it aiiint workin ouut - but hes like i dont even need to try, i can just tell other people to do it for me. Then special snowflakes actually do.
---
Also none of my concern for downvoting masochists.
---
I'm happy
---
+1 for "black frog operation" alone.
---
Just remember to keep in safe the loot after each site, otherwise the moment you explode (it will happen no matter what you're doing) you lose ship and loot.
---
And FFS remember to bookmark the exit 😂
---
There are so many quiet areas of Null sec you could probably just scan down wormholes from high sec and go in to ninja mine.
---
You should get in contact with a Tornado expert instead.
---
I'd suggest to download a fitting software (like pyfa) and create the fit for yourself and start experimenting.
---
I'd start by selecting Loki (you mentioned that you want to use it). Cloaking plus arty alpha means two subsystem choices are set (covops and projectile). As a rule of thumb, I'd always go with the largest arty that can be fitted, this case they are the 720mm ones. Fit as many as you can. Also, add a covops cloak in the highs, and an expanded probe launcher is also handy.
---
Check how many low and midslots you have, and fill them with what you need. Add as many sebos as you need to reach the desired lockspeed (you'll see it in the software, along with the approximated lock times). I'd go with a 2-3 secs frigate locktime.
---
Decide the range you want to be from the gate, and select ammo and add optimal range boosting tracking modules (lows-mids) accordingly. Then, fill the rest with gyrostabs.
---
Sidenote, fit tank if you feel the need. Also, fitting neuts to empty highs could save you from hero frigate pvpers who will launch themselves at you to get an easy kill.
---
Spai
---
Just tell them that if you have a shit wallet history, youre either gonna be a shitty spy or not a spy at all.
---
Yeah thank you about that. :rolls eyes:
---
Pretty solid advice here, thank you. Gives me some more stuff to think about for sure. Much appreciated.
---
I'm not trying to sit off of normal star gates and gank haulers or mission boats. Just frigs and smaller things in FW space.
---
I tried explaining when i applied to karma fleet. Welp never have i ever got rejected that fast. And im kinda an ugly guy so i get rejected alot but not as fast as how karma rejected my app. Lol
---
And besides why would i be a spy. Like that would be fun for my style of gameplay. I wanna be in big news worthy fights. How can i participate in those if im spying.
---
It doesn't like he thinks. It doesn't affect it because instead of 20s because they can then lock &gt; start applying damage, whereas a 5s cycle will happen more often but only briefly.
---
This makes ecm drones effectiveish against trig while also stopping them from being ramped up for half a minute just whenever.
---
On the flip side, this change only positively effects trig ship interactions in that way, even though they're built to use smart bombs effectively.. All of them
---
This is honestly a stupid change, and people who don't think so don't have any foresight. This sets a stupid precedence and they already have been making good changes towards ecm lately, why this randomly arbitrary change all of a sudden?
---
Who knows. Can't wait to see the next thing they change on a whim.
---
If you have an alt, it is also maybe worth to test your alpha application in sisi, to get a feeling what frigates you can hit in what distance for what damage. For example, Tremor Ms have bad tracking, but the huge range somewhat compensates in the angular velocity.
---
Tl;dr warp in your alt in a frig in sisi and try to alpha it in your loki. Then try it while your alt is moving. Few rounds will already give you an idea.
---
All battlecruisers in Deklein are cynos.
---
Freely move rigs? Well, with a mobile depo you can move the subs. I think that's what you're saying. Also, sisi, yes good idea lol. I'm thinking I will have to be kind of close so I can web and maybe warp disrupt the target. Although, maybe just the web would work? Should only have to hold them for a second.
---
yeah there are plenty of ways to enjoy yourself, as people have said. do you expect the game to be enjoying in the new 2-3 years? debatable
---
Good to know. Thank you.
---
- freely move rigs, i mean if you want to remove them, you no longer need to *destroy* them, you can resell them
---
- depends on your engagement range. personally i'd never go in webrange, i'd keep myself at around 50km. if you go webrange then go for a scram, but then you are vulnerable to get countertackled and lose 500m loki to 10m worth of frigates.
---
Blocks fleet broadcasts too.
---
Worth pointing out the "trial" could be 2-5 months before feeling you need to pay/
---
There are other big nullsec Alliances that will take you in, even without a esi check.
---
look into Horde, they will be in the same news-worthy fights than goons.
---
Lul
---
*sniff* *Sniff* **SPAI!!**
---
Back before skill injectors, unless someone gave you a skill plan you would likely not fly anything an alpha can't for a few months, over a month at least even with a skill plan. I doubt many people would play that long if they weren't having fun.
---
In short, yes you can have fun. Eve is about the people you fly with, not what ships you fly in.
---
Use a proteus
---
It is impossible if they're actually watching the hole - you make a noise as you splash in and you hit grid for a minimum of one tick so if they have someone cloaked and watching, they will see you.
---
You will also appear on dscan for a minimum of one tick between breaking gate cloak and recloaking. That is a bit of a lottery for whether you are seen on dscan as the dscan refresh period is about 3 ticks.
---
The best you can do is recloak immediately after breaking gate cloak and hope no-one sees you in that 1 second.
---
What really sucks is the first guy did't even have enough buy orders up to fully capitalize.
---
You never fight a solo nereus :)
---
Tracking Disruptor:  Am I a Joke to you?
---
Ok, there is sometime a second decimal that you don't get to see just fks up things... just get another MTU.
---
Yes i havent tried applying to horde yet. Lemme do that now actually
---
*sniff* *sniff* REPORTED
---
We will have to nagasaki them aswell to get that result
---
For someone who has played EVE for ages with omega clone: Nnnnot really, because if you have some specific skills you rely on, they might not be there.
---
But for a brand new player? Sure! Alpha gives you unlimited time to get used to the game, to learn things and stuff like that. And you can even PVP with smaller ships in FW space. Just make sure you engage only ships that you know you can take on, but this is something you learn over time.
---
And you can buy omega with PLEX with ingame money, but I advise against that, it's huge grind and burns out a lot of people.
---
Yeah definitely, if we are ratting with a group we'll do it. Individuals won't always so there is a chance, but you shouldn't be too surprised or disappointed when people notice and dock up.
---
Why don't you just anchor a astra and a Athanor in a low class wh and mine? Cheaper  in the long run and you still make profit even if u lose ships occasionally
---
Great scene from a great movie.
---
I think it's totally fun just fine as a free2play player. It will take you a while to get used to the game and even get your skills high enough to take advantage of the paid features when you get there.
---
Just stick to highsec. More money to be made there
---
K
---
Sorry there. You have hull damage clearly. Cloak no work
---
Tristans are better
---
I guess yeah, you wouldn't really need to web anything if you can lock and shoot fast enough.
---
Tq will die soon. Run for the hillss
---
Good video. The comet really is the best Navy frigate. Do you think a max tank rail fit would do better in those situations when you were being scram kited? It just seems so difficult to actually apply all that juicy blaster dps.
---
Good
---
No one uses a proteus anymore though...
---
Kick ascee :)

Is this a copy pasta?

Yeah finding info is hard these days. These care bears want us to do the work for them lmao.

Something like that maybe.

My character's last name is also Davaham and I also got my first big exploration treasure yesterday and I also fly a Magnate *and* I was also told to change my ship's name yesterday. Are you perhaps me from an alternate universe? Great haul, make sure to double check the prices of the items as you can easily lose a quarter of that money by selling in the wrong system / region!

You sound dramatic so they probably dodged a bullet
---
Yeah, I have bought half priced contracts from my alt once or twice before realizing I put them up a few weeks earlier because it's some bulky junk in inconvenient location.
---
How can I know your desires eh? It's free to play for alphas try it out and decide yourself

Horde or brave are probably ur only chances.

Just do some market trading for a while, the wallet log transaction limit is pretty low. A bit too late for that though, you're probably in a goon blacklist now.
---

That's literally what a spai would say.
---
:)
---
I mean in the shit coalition that gotg is, the only useful members are sib-sq and ranger regiment, I would expect darkness to do another thing different than welp cormorants
---
I'm not so sure an auto targeter is needed though right? Not for picking off frigs, mostly gunning for small stuff
---
Thought EVE players is a better educated group of people. Nah, every online game is toxic. By the way, Tiananmen Sqaure democracy protesters didn't even know what the democracy exactly is. And what do you expect Western journalist report about China. If really want to talk about other countries, go there and ask normal people about the truths.
---
 Spah!
---
Yea, it’s not needed.
---
Yeah probably. Oh well. I joined horde already. Hoping for the best.
---
I frequently name mine “MCAV PACO, FIGHT ME.”
---
Yes, although it probably changes if they stay on grid or not, how they fly. The rocket fit stuff for example would be trying to orbit close, rather than at scram range, etc.
---
One of the nice surprise about this fit is that it can win even without range control, against scram kiters, at scram kite range, which is at least a little surprising.
---
Im.new to the game. But i know what big a lie that is hahaha. Been mining in a venture in high sec and believe me the money is sht hahaha
---
there is no protection, you can rent a system / join renting corp, but that doesnt mean someone will protect you from others
---
Aww ye bb welcome home &lt;3 Be sure to get on Discord and wait pings, there's plenty of fleets, and often big ones.
---
You got into Horde within 20 minutes?
---
&gt;Adds PH to list of alliances to not join
---
Yeah im learning to set things up now. Thank you 😊
---
too real haha
---
False.
---
But atleast i got into a decent manned pvp nullsec alliance. And thats all i wanted in eve. To be part of something bigger
---
Certainly it's more engageable
---
Sentences man
---
Im upvoting you tho. Cause you actually made me chuckle.
---
Best of luck just be careful. Fly safe
---
I enjoy alliance sponsored fleets.
---
Thank you good sir 😊 you too.
---
didn't the deal sort make include panfam as well? but for less times. i think it was 6 months for dumpster co and 3 for panfam(?). gobbins didn't like that sort made any kind of deal and that's when this whole ph vs gotg thing started. 
---
iirc this whole thing happened after north lost 2-3 keepstars in like two weeks, while co2 was still an alliance living in fade.
---
I set up as an Alpha a couple weeks ago and have been having a great time. I will almost certainly pay for a sub in time - it’s not hugely expensive imo - but the game is huge already. I’ve played for hours and hours and have still only scratched the surface. 
---
I think I would feel under pressure to ‘make the most out of it’ if I were paying, which is difficult to do at the start because the game is so big and the mechanics can seem daunting at first. 
---
Tl:dr? Yes. Worth it.
---
Yeah, thats my point. He's inadvertently making money because of the twitch platform. It's not your classic rmt situation.
---
&gt; Hi all. I'm thinking about giving EVE a chance, but I can't pay for Omega. So is the game enjoyable for a F2P player? And is there any other way to pay Omega instead of using actual money, like in-game currency? 
---
Game can be a bit enjoyable at first as an alpha, but to do anything half decent in it you'll need omega, to do anything good at a relatively good quality level, you will need multiple omegas. One doesn't cut it.
---
Grinding for ISK (the ingame currency) as an alpha, sucks major ass and is so bad that many people have burned out and quit while trying. Its not impossible, but it is highly recommended to steer away from it for many really good reasons.
---
Nice stroke
---
Cloak gives you targeting delay after deactivation, which is around 5s. For most frigs and destroyers that time is more than enough. 
---
Since you want to fly loki, you already got minmatar cruiser 5. Train some more and get a sebo huginn. They are invisible on dscan, cost 3 times less than an ok fitted loki (walmart fit goes for around 250m) and you don't get skillpoint loss when you inevitably get baited and lose it.
---
As an Alpha, you will be a toy for seasoned Omega veterans. You will be our play thing, our dungeon critter. We will find you and drag you through the stellar dust and tickle you because we don’t want to have all the fun.
---
real explo pvp is popping people's cans in hisec
---
You've already heard it from others. Here's the take on it:
---
Goons won, you were backed by your old allies which were NC., PL and PH. Morale couldn't have been good for the defenders at that time, which is understandable. Many people, again someone mentioned this, seem to think that GOTG had nearly given up in the periods before the main invasion.
---
Complaints about low numbers from GOTG in joint fleets was reported. However, I have heard a few different things here, so not sure what to make of it. In some cases it seemed like your allies tried more than you to defend your space.
---
Then your relationship to your new neighbours, CO2, started to suffer. Not going to comment further other than I have no idea how might've started that. Certainly doesn't help, though.
---
With morale being as low as it probably was at the end, you decide to negotiate a deal to be left alone. For a year, wasn't it(?). However GOTG would aid their coalition if goons deployed somewhere else during that period.
---
I think we all can understand Gobbins' reaction to this. GOTG no longer has to worry about goons burning down the rest of their space, and they can relax for a while. The concern was, would GOTG take another goon deployment towards someone else seriously? Low morale + knowing at least GOTG is safe could lead to even lower fleet numbers.
---
Gobbins deployed the same SIGs that previously defended GOTG, to SB-SQ space together with Black Legion to show that you can't just leave your allies out of the deal like that, and expect to be left alone. Shenanigans happened, one TZ couldn't do much to the other, PH went back as goons started pressuring Geminate.
---
NC. was supposedly not very happy with that deployment, but I don't know what their exact reactions or thoughts were at the time. At this point it seems they agree more than ever with PH's decision.
---
Especially now after you see that you're clearly aligned towards goons / TEST, more or less as renters / pets, to be honest. I recall Sort getting questions about working with goons shortly after the deal with them. He said he wouldn't start working to them. (Great, why bend the knee anyways?) At this point I'm not so sure to be honest.
---
I also suppose NC. decided to hang on and join in with PH seeing as they've grown a lot over the past year or so compared to what they were before that. A way stronger ally to have in their coalition.
---
Prencleeve?
---
If you apply web to a frig or dessie that has initiated warp, you will just instantly send them in warp (like freighters are webbed into warp). If small ship pilot has initiated warp somewhere or activated gate and gets warp disrupted, ship just stops untill they give it another command to move. With arty, long range disruptors are very nice and with cheap mutaplasmids you can make your own pretty cheap.
---
Your coalition lost eight titans to BL/PH. NC actually did try to help GotG for a timer once with a full carrier fleet but ended up getting waterboarded by Horde.
---
I counted 49 words before the first comma and 150 something until we finally saw a period. I literally took the time to count that instead of reading this because it’s that bad.
---
Was only 1 month for others iirc. Which, considering they got 6 months essentially means they paid goons to shoot NC/PL/PH for 5 months over them.
---
It is now.
---
For me, yes. I have been an alpha for almost two years now. I enjoy explo and flying tackle and logi, and you can do all three of those to a limited capacity as an alpha. Alphas will be worse than an omega in almost everything on paper, but 5 million focused sp is very powerful, and you can easily get a lot out of it, especially if you train multiple characters.
---
Could you link the fit please?
---
Theres a faction cloak that lowers the decloak recalibration time to 3 seconds, I think its the smokescreen one. Its fairly expensive though. There's also rigs that lower the decloao recal timer too so you can really cheese it up and get down to like a 2s decloak + instalock. If you time it right you'll pop em right after they initiate warp on the gate.
---
&gt;there is no I Win Button.
---
A whole bunch of less then a month old super alts are saying hello. Add to that AFK multiboxed or outright botted Rorqs and VNIs just for starters.
---
You definitely get an A+ in the wall o’ text category. I’m curious about how you feel about a real career
---
&gt;Our supposed "Allies" sent Pandemic Horde, paid Black Legion
---
NC. moved their entire super fleet, risked it on multiple KS battles.
---
NC. forced co2 to meatshield fade for you during the entire goon deployment, Co2 did a lot more than any GOTG alliance. 
---
&gt;NC said they were more like "NATO" and did nothing to help or stop it, we go to do the same thing to horde a few months later and you have a NC super fleet trying to catch our move op, and have helped on multiple timers, and to top it all off they came to shoot structures in our home territory (which kicked off this full renters and things reset)
---
NC. said pretty clear they they wouldn't get involved in the war between Horde and GOTG. When you start to hit strategic systems for defending Tribute and Vale you surely understand why NC. would do something about it.
---
Btw 42kk isn't much and you can get more (especially when exploring Stain or one of Angel's cartel regions). Sometimes you'll get 80-90kk from one container! But be careful, remember not to scan if the local chat isn't empty and always check the dscan. Fly safe!
---
Do you do them in the same station?
---
That’s actually the duct tape section, and they used the cheap kind that doesn’t cloak!
---
Yes. Fullerides base price seems to be off. For example.. 400 mil on complex reactions tax for 2.8 bil in value at 12.3% tax. It shouldn't be higher than 330.
---
Clay pigeon shooting ceptors being ejected from a POS password change in tornados was quite a fun game too.
---
The main thing holding you back as a pure f2p alpha clone is the 5 million skillpoint cap. There's 2 ways to overcome this.
---
Make your first account as a sort of trial character, train a bunch of different stuff, see what you like and what you wanna do. Then make your next character focus on the thing that you enjoy doing. Maybe it's pvp in frigates, so you maximize all the relevant frigate skills, t2 small guns, t2 small missiles, Light drone skills, and some core skills, and you hit 5mil. You can use the recruit a friend program to make new accounts with free sp to save time.
---
Then while playing this new character you train a new one to do whatever you want to try next. You really wanna fly battleships? Pick one, all the support/weapon skills for it are probably gonna leave you near the 5mil sp cutoff. Now you switch between the two character depending on what you wanna do at the time. And on and on and on.
---
It might sound annoying but on the plus side, it might leave you in a better position if you decide to get serious and sub later on. Alts are pretty important in this game, and you could wind up with a lot of them if you play f2p for a long time.
---
The longer you play, the easier it will become to get isk to sub a character in a month. Then you find you can afford 2, then 3, then 4, etc. I haven't had to pay real money for a sub in years.
---
Getting flash backs to when I used to be a CEO and there was this one dude who always wanted to do shit, just relax.
---
&gt;Goons hiroshima-ed their ass enough that they now like goons
---
Oh like when that GoTG FC, I forget his name, ordered all the faction titans to dock up in fear of giving away a bling killmail?
---
@ u/suitonia
---
You know how all the other EWAR drones are not getting any use for anything other then occasional novelty ? Could you bring this up or ask CCP about them ? They are overall extremely ineffective. This is a large portion of the issues with ECM drones, not necessarily that they are too OP, but rather that the other ones are so shitty they aren't worth carrying in your drone bay. So there are really no alternatives. If the otehr drones worked semi-decent, there would be less people using ECM drones because they have only so much space and drone bandwidth on their ships.
---
Second question, general EWAR related, not just drones. Why are there no Dampener battleships in the game at all ? Every faction has its EWAR represented in the battleship line of ships, except Gallente, there is not a single dampener bonused battleship in the game. Whats up with that ?
---
usually people who do that use a tackle/bait alt
---
yeah, you are right about the 1 month. I didn't remember that correctly and i actually ended up using the search button. I still think that the deal wasn't the main reason for the hostilities between ph and gotg though cause if goons were in geminate attacking horde, it doesn't make sense for horde to be deployed to Branch. 
---
not that it really matters, to generate content of that scale, most of the time you need a reason, that doesn't mean that it's a valid reason. 
---
content is content no matter the "excuse" and we can always use more of it
---
Highs 4x 720 t2, empry slot for module of your choosing, light missile launcher or maybe small neut
---
Meds 2x webs t2, 2x sebo t2 with scanres script, restrained 50mn, warp disruptor t2
---
Lows reactor co trol t2 and 3x gyro t2
---
Rigs are of your choosing so decide for yourself if you want to have more buffer, warp faster, lock faster or idk put drone mining augmentors.
---
As for drones you can go full dps with 4 mediums  or ec-300, see for yourself. 
---
27 pwg and 111 cpu left so you can modify it as you want. It doesn't have much of a tank but for your needs i believe this is p much as niche as it gets and you know the more niche a ship is the better it does that one thing.
---
funny how the tooltip can convert km value into au value  
---
off grid brawls when

Actually yes but for old players itsn't not because of content lock.

I think it was basically...

Horde felt betrayed.

Horde wanted an offensive deployment after doing defense for months.

Horde decides to piss in Cheerios of group they felt betrayed them.

Yeah too many people play EVE as it is. Let's get those numbers way down.
---
Does CCP read Reddit?
---
It's not like there are already many Chinese players in TQ
---
This time is just around 1k migrants from Serenity
---
When horde and BL attacked branch, space violence deployed to Geminate and all the goon cloaky campers sig deployed to Geminate and Kalvela Expanse. Test also attacked their Hisec operations. 
---
A massive part of why they failed in Branch was due to their home regions burning. Pretty sure Horde lost a Sotiyo with a Komodo in build while they were in Branch also.

They fucked up their own shit to the point that its so FUBAR they have to quit. Now they're coming to do the same on TQ.
---
Thought so, the problem is IMO the targeting delay and the little dance on the keyboard you'll have to pull off every time. Tornado isn't invisible but can sit so far off that some might think you're just chilling. Then you send tremor volley.

Maybe, just maybe, they weren't intended to be chained?

Aren't you the guy (er, self-proclaimed devil, nice one edgelord) who got Twitch banned for taking his shirt off on stream?

&gt;I see people running them in dual ravens and barghest and whatnot, but I don't think you can just use a single box
---
This is what I did back in the day. Basically you can dual box any of the missile shield ships that can be fit for passive tank and have enough mids left for boosters to GTFO when you need to.
---
I'm very low level i don't know how to do that yet

was in a heron couldn't break an imicus, his stratios buddies landed after he went through, I followed him and had to go back through and warp before the stratios's completely left warp.

Which is why I never said I could deny them entry if they did, after all I'm not CCP.
---
No I was talking about how many times defenders were able to get a kill. 4% of the time.
---
Kill efficiency is how much isk you kill compared to how much you lose. You can lose 2000 ships and kill 1 ship and still get 99% efficiency.
---
that duck tape is harvested from parts which aren't the cloaka
---
But the majority of bots are alpha VNI bots. They don’t need plex, so there’s no real reason for them to buy it. Yes many other bots require omega, but even then they’ll still make more than enough to plex with 2x what plex is now.
---
So what you're saying is, you just bought a lot of plex and you're hoping that someone goes and raises the price for you?
---
Someone study economics explain it to him please.
---
Lack of text formatting should be a bannable offense, this post constitutes psychological abuse.
---
Thank you for your valuable contribution to the discussion
---
I don't know if there's an easier way, but I check the prices of the more expensive items [here](https://eve-marketdata.com/) before selling. That time it turned out I could get 10m more (out of 36!) by jumping through some 5 or 6 stargates. That's good ISK/hour for me \^^
---
Botting isn't the only issue that PIBC had, never stated that was the only one, they made a much more egregious sin that botting. 
---
 I also agree that NC/PL kind of did the same in the past, but in the end NC did not go and obliterate any competition in the map by any means. The difference between PIBC and PanFam/insert group here is that you don't see vince, villy or whomever telling their line members to go out and cheat. We don't see goons or any other large coalition in Tranquility going out of their way, committing EVERYTHING to annihilate their "enemies". Well I could be wrong there, but certainly not the same effort PIBC did. 
---
 I'm not sure how any sane person would think that PIBC alone joining tranquility would break the status quo on the server. People are just complaining like usual on r/eve. Again I will sate this again, as long as PIBC joins the server with no intentions to do all the cheating they did in serenity, there is no problem. They already have a nice presence through goons and FRT so if they are already here committing the same shit they did in serenity, then all we can do is pray CCP actually cares about combating rule breakers. 
---
I will also address that Tiancity did a REALLY shitty job managing their server. There was a myriad of issues on serenity that caused led to the fuck fest of serenity, but at the of the day, players made the choice to break rules, and this particular group I'm specifically referring to is called PIBC.
---
We tried to do this in Signal Cartel as part of our anniversary celebrations in Thera. We had just gotten the teams on the field and our "football" (which was a shuttle) in place, and the whistle had been blown and we were all burning toward the football, when the locals started blowing us all up.
---
Inadvertently my ass.  It's intentional AF.
---
I don't care if you're slow, but don't act like I am.
---
Short answer, no  
---
as an alpha your progression is 2x slower than an omega and you can't train every skill in this game (the most important) and as alpha some basic skill take an entire week/month to train...  
---
after that if you want to farm your 500 plex (1month omega) you will burn out and really don't enjoy this game  
---
the beginner experience in this game is shit that's why they don't attract anyone
---
When you reach a certain size, it gets hard to manage everyone. Combating botting should be done by CCP not players.
---
Context: Rag jumps in to boson talwar fleet, misses, only kills one, snuff drops and nukes the rag. Big Fs. Dreads currently being tackled in M-0
---
he pay bosonic fee
---
Dreads out, we lost two. I heard something about one dread SDing on the keepstar grid but unsure of accuracy.
---
&gt;Dreads currently being tackled in M-0
---
Well you are acting slow.. just because it's inadvertent rmt, doesn't mean it's not intentional lol. He's found a loop hole, probably why twitch and/or CCP haven't banned him..
---
Or I could use my capped out ganking character and not need multiple ships to get the kill.
---
By the time I typed it out it already happened :pepehands:
---
Nice dunk btw.
---
Look up what inadvertently means.
---
You either don't know what that word means, or you thinking retarded
---
I'm not sure how you can take PGL serious.
---
Dreads tackled by dictors 3000km away and unable to take initiative to warp down and tackle. Nerf Dictors
---
&gt;As for paying for Omega time with ISK, it can be done but the game becomes a lot less fun when your only focus is earning the 2+B isk needed to pay for a sub each month. 
---
I learned that with *RuneScape". Sure, 6mil (now around 30) is more than feasible, but it's not really fun.
---
Hail Mittani! Hail satan! Welcome year zero!
---
don't make him think skill injector are for new player/alpha they are just some speculative money for rich player and only used by rich-rich-rich player who inject rorqual and shit
---
For sure. There are lots of ways to have fun as an alpha, but sometimes you gotta be creative. Joining a large newbie Corp helps a lot.
---
You fuck with the bull, you get the horns.
---
Well it would be pointless to use one as an alpha
---
To be honest, I think CCP should make their lives easier. Hitting F1 and clicking a button is pretty difficult.

&gt; the problem with this logic is assuming that ranger regiment and siberian squads give a fuck about anything that isn't dank ticks
---
ranger regiment and siberian squads give better fights and *take* more fights not in their favour than most alliances we've fought so far. That's quite unfair to them really.
---
I was pretty bummed when I docked in a Keepstar for the first time (in a sub cap) and it was just the same old boring station interior.
---
no i haven't. but, the explanation you've  given me makes sense. i hope their research covers  some interesting things in the end if they choose eve
---
Love the video! I started FW like a week ago. I've been flying a FNC myself and the way I like to fly, I think that fit in that video is something I would like to try out for sure.
---
That's correct. Zergling Rush SDed to deny the main subcap fleets the kill mail opportunity.
---
that is correct
---
hahahaha
---
Chill man, I'm not defending the guy... Just saying he could easily argue he accidentally engaged in rmt. Thats why he's doing passive accumulation of points for all viewers regardless of subscription status or even if you are following. He's just "trading in game items for fake points" and the only cash received is from twitch ad revenue not Eve players..
---

---
It's one of the best places anywhere in EVE for content per unit time. If you have any questions or want to bounce ideas off of me, you can catch me on discord: Lasker Emanuel#9016
---
And I'm saying that there's nothing accidental or passive about it. He is intentionally and actively converting in-game assets into cash. That is definition RMT.
---
Whether or not it's RMT that's against the EULA is not my business. (Remember that not all RMT is bad, selling Plex is technically RMT).
---
If you're going to white knight this had, maybe know the definitions of the words you use.
---
do you know what punctuation is? theres so much random sperg here I cant read it.
---
 You just repeated what I said? Doesn't necessarily mean that they'll require game servers to be run from within the country. They can just restrict access to things they consider anti-government very easily.
---
Like I said I'm not defending him lol..
---
Just that he's found what is a very apparent and obvious loophole..
---
If you can't see or understand that there is no hope for you bud..
---
And getting some internet stuff is unhealthy! 
---
Shaka brah! Go smoke a j or something and have a more chill day!
---
There's no reason EVE can't be enjoyable for alphas.
---
One thing to note is that as a new player, even as an omega you won't have tge aupport skills to sit in a battleship in the first month. There's no sense gunning for it if you are new to the game, go for a cruiser instead - and alphas can fly all of the pirate cruisers, and use all of the T2 cruiser-sized weapon platforms :)

Very nice man, comets forever !

---
The loki can decloak as you enter grid, and by the time you exit warp it can lock you up with no troubles.
---
yes but that only happens in branch, tenal, and sometimes venal.
---
Yes, you are defending him, and like I said, I don't know if he's breaking any rules or not. It's not my job to either make or inforce rules regarding monitizing CCPs IP.
---
I was just answering the question about how this is RMT.
---
  *,,,,
---
Somehow agree with you. Media is the most powerful propaganda machine no matter who controls it. People shouldn't simply believe everything media says. They should go there and find the truth by themselves.

unironically very accurate
---
he's the only one i know.
---
So many poors hating on my ideas
---
Just a word of advice doesn't stick to one place and don't become known. Fw has some serial blobbers and they will bait your ass. The Loki is a nice choice, I've one-shot asteros burning back to wormholes so it's definitely doable.
---
It's RMT in the strictest definition in that he's converting in-game assets to RL cash.  I get that the phrase "RMT" is often associated with only rule breaking RMT, but the fact is anytime you convert cash to in-game stuff or back, it's actually RMT.
---
I don't know if this instance actually breaks any rules though.  I seems like it should, but I'm not an expert in these things.
---
SOCO has gone downhill hard since metal ravenous was kicked
---
This is true I was there.
---
proceeds to join the bigger blue donut, like 70% of null.
---
I had a roughly 2b loki fit with dual cap batteries, ran the sub cap ones ok but the dps is low at 6-700ish so they take too long and end up worse than other options in game for isk/hr.             
---
             
---
The boosters broke the isk/hr for lvl5’s as its a supply demand game. There is currently far too much supply so earnings are about half what they were last year.              
---
               
---
I made more isk/hr scanning combat sites in nul than i would running a loki lvl5, tengu is worse than loki in lvl5’s.
---
You're almost right apart from the constant that is Sort stabbing his allies in the back.
---
i am a new eve player and what made me laugh in this game was when i went to bounty hunters tab and saw the description/info on the top 1 bounty hunter, full of jokes...
---
now, to be honest, i have no idea what i am doing in the game, i have no friends or corp/guild, i am currently doing npc missions in a cruiser with missiles, i think it's named caracal or something
---
i wish i could be more positive about the game, but idk how, and i don't like people who just says "google it", "research about it", "find in forum" etc, friends are not supposed to do that, oh well
---
CCP Boost T1 hulls and make T2 essentially an expensive resistance buff at best, in some cases like the punisher have better fitting than its T2 counter-part,
---
THEN
---
They kick out the legs of the end-game/highest tier ships making HAW essentially useless and might of well of just removed HAW's entirely (as they track like regular capital guns now).  
---
In the long run however, this just means that the evolution of the player from t1 rifter pilot to Hac, Carriers and Dreads, Supers is basically fucked. Simply just stick with T1 cruisers and below and your golden.
---
Yeah, great write-ups too. Keep it coming!
---
That is some top shelf premium salt.
---
Yeah, I dropped 100k fermionics for one tenth the correct price. That was a ~10b mistake 😐
---
Good salt but you should stay extra classy next time and send him a satisfaction survey instead
---
Raven obviously. I miss the old ways so I'm tryna bring it back.
---
logic like this is why goonswarm fields fleets of 300 titans
---
Rattle no, tengu ish loki yes but slow. Unless your bringing a carrier a barghast is better, mjd out of range and finish the mission before you cap out or you have to leave and come back.             
---
Isk/hr is currently not great due to oversupply caused by boosters, try sisi for fitting optimisation. Most missions you want to be 160k+ away from the baddies
---
T3 and t4 gila shouldn't be around a bill.  You can run 3s in a t1 with the right fit no bling. Its the 5 runners that take a shit load of money.
---
As for your being stuck in the same place.. Move.. Or pick a ship and fly it instead.. Hunt escalations.. Get a smartbomber and farm 6s. Your in the same spot probably cuz you chose to be.. No disrespect. I hovered around for like 2-4 years before I started seeing real income solo beyond running a few sites. Just get out of your comfort zone wit something cheap. The game isk always about making isk either. Ex WHer btw.. 
---
Its totally playable without spending billions or even $$s you just have to know what to do. Dont fly expensive stuff.. Make am alpha to hold money for you youll quickly forget you have it lol. Hell save isk in plex.  
---
Most players biggest issue isnt isk generation its keeping it in their wallet lol
---
It brings me so much pain when I see someone with a cool name being such a little bitch. It's like if Spine Ripper was the guy furiously typing "HELP" in local when tackled.
---
As for Serenity, there are no cheaters but tons of botters. You know Serenity is in single timezone but there are always more than 3k 'players' online from 2:00AM to 6:00AM. They bot 23 hours a day.(server DT takes 1 hour)
---
It's not a fight I got, so I don't know. Back of the envelope DPS/EHP math makes me think it's going to be close, so it probably gets settled by whoever flys better (picking the right ammo, positioning yourself to do max damage with that ammo, managing reps, etc.)
---
Thank you, glad you enjoyed!
---
Seems weird he doesn't mention phosphoric acid, given that it reacts with the underlying metal to form iron (III) phosphate that forms a passivation layer.  Not only does it prevent further oxidation but it also is a good base layer for painting.
---
Same thing. Botters are scum cheaters.
---
But if you do it with a gang, then more people get the satisfactions of shooting down a prick.
---
Horde sounds nice.
---
More in the works!
---
Why isnt he kicked from hit alliance yet?
---
Remember when PL was good at EVE?
---
Done.
---
Lol. Alright bud. ;)
---
Yeah gotg did that. Nc prob saw their autism wasnt worth the effort
---
Yup. We operate with a cloaked ship on each known entrance, so we can always see/hear people come in, and we filter out all known sigs so the second a new one spawns anyone not scanning can dock up... or be bait.
---
You can use injectors to go beyond 5, yes?
---
No. I actually joined because I thought space mining was cool. But if I tuned in to see how boring it was in game I wouldn't have bothered with the game. ESPECIALLY since this guy doesn't actually interact with his chat really at all. These kind of practices of falsely boosting view count is scum baggy and hurts the game.
---
This ship has been a little OP for a long time. I personally think it should lose a drone and some of its speed to help balance it.
---
Surely with a 5 second cycle its going to hit more often and possibly re jam before you finish lock and cycle guns.
---
Always wondered how sappo made his money

Faction guns drop as prebuilt modules. In the next patch they will drop as blueprints and as such will be substantially more expensive. So if someone caught some leaked info they could stand to make billions hoarding huge quantities of faction guns they bought at dirt cheap prices for when they spike up in price after the patch.
---
Starting Eve
---
Except he's asking for money, it's a real life scam.
---
Because they both survive without issue. Shield fit Thanatos and hel will get similar damage as they both get fighter damage bonuses. The archon and chimera get resistance bonuses and no damage bonuses so they are incredibly inferior for ratting.
---
Get a kill mail -&gt; post to Reddit about it.
---
If he's not breaking the EVE EULA, he's breaking the Twitch TOS and possibly the law.
---
Good job detective.

---
Oh right, I read something about that in the thread linked, It just wasn't clear to me.
---
So does this mean that those guns would have to be built now, therefore making the abyssal mats even more scarce than they already are?
---
Fit a T3 cruiser that can fight, cloak, scan and analyze and dive into wormholes. Run anomalies there and mix it up with data and relic sites. Much less numbing, better rewards.
---
It's the process in how it's converted. Most streamers just give away assets like ships or isk (Rarely plex but sometimes) to anyone watching stream. They might make money from the stream but the money isnt directly tied to in game assets. 
---
But as I said before, if he's converting donations and subs into points and then people redeem points for in game items, that should be banned immediately if it isn't banned already.
---
I know... But i got some personal problems and i'm not able to buy it. As i said, i'll get it when i can
---
stop posting
---
In theory active cloaking works best when directly applied to smooth homogeneous surfaces. The rough, pitted nature of rust interferes with the resonance of the cloak resulting in spotty coverage at best.

&gt;I've had a ton of LP and gone through the motions of doing research on what to sell and when.

Yea I've done all this. I'm looking for a simple LP buyer to just get rid of my LP for 1k isk per LP miniumum.

It won't make the mats more scarce, but the guns themselves will.
---
never not kick ascee
---
A quick glance on EVEwho shows he joins and leaves corporations all the time, never really stays for more than 1-2 months, if that.  There's probably a good reason for that and if you want to predict future behaviour you look at the past.
---
Frankly looking at his killboard I honestly don't understand why you took him in in the first place.
---
Wow, I bet you are like best friends with wallymart's aren't you?
---
I bet you guys bump helmets.
---
Did you get flairbaited?
---
well it isnt my fault you guys dont speak basic fucking english, also wtf you guys dont even sub to my tumblr, wtf is the point of being there
---
u got baited into kicking him into a better alliance, bravo
---
From what I remember doing as a newb almost everything I did in my first ~4 months are pretty much all alpha accessible activities.  Definitely enough time to figure out if you like eve as a game.  And the game has changed enough that you could take a slightly different path and probably extend that a few extra months
---
The joke
---
No reason to apologize. I’m sorry you feel that way.

How was the game different then than it is now?

How to own yourself in a nutshell

I'm kind of impressed that Wally's posting was so awesome that corp leadership was worried NC would reff structures over reddit posts.
---
If someone told me too stop posting on /r/eve I would tell them to go fuck themselves too.
---
Personally I think that log post; puts you in a worse light than whoever Wally is... why the fuck do you care what someone else thinks about you in a computer game.... its a computer game.
---
ITT I learned Wally is actually the OP, 4D chess move to get people to feel bad for Wallymarts.  
---
Well played Wally, well played.
---
that’s what you get for flying garmurs to be fair.

&gt;Enjoy your new irrelevant alliance

Everyone in the girl hole is still on slack together and there was zero falling out.
---
We are all buddies just too many of us went afk... personally I blame doki.
---
Did you batphone init before making this post?
---
Wow very angry f1 pusher
---
I would have just kicked him for being an unfunny shitposter but ok
---
Doesn't even come close to himalaya salt.
---
Why come up with some crybaby BS about kicking over reddit posts when he's apparently ingame cancer? That makes you and yours look like even more of a bitch that you blamed the kicking on worrying about NC and not on him being a shitler in coms.
---
Sat in a belt with my Rorqual pretending to be afk. Cowkiller came in with 50 bombers. I killed 5 right off the bat, he had to play hard on his jamming game, he smartly told his bombers that not to orbit but to align and moment I yellow box to warp off since I would drop drones right before I got lock to insta pop his bombers. About 30 minutes later they left. I asked why he left, cowkiller told me, "We want to find content, not become content." 
---
It was fun. His jamming game was on point. I would have killed 20+ bombers had he not been. A single volley is all it took me to kill the bombers, but the quick jams made it so only 2-3 drones actually hit, saving the bombers.

You can call Wally a lot of things. But dumb isn't one of them.

I can buy bot having "a normal conversation with him", but have you met most of the people in this game?

That attitude changed every since i got him a new fucking haircut, and you guys sperged out about the flywheel being racist

Can you even batphone them when their fcs are banned?

Oof.

I've absolutely sold items to/purchased items from myself before in trade hubs.

TFW you shitpost so hard you get NC. to make threats on your structures.

Deliver ships in a citadel located in a WH. Kill said citadel and the ships will pop out, owned by whoever recieved them.

Kicking people over reddit posting makes your alliance the biggest joke in the game, even bigger than MC.

I know that much I just wanna believe this is some kind of twisted killboard revenge scheme for this loss here lol.

[https://zkillboard.com/kill/75453740/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75453740/)

All of those ships were delivered to Ektallion in a citadel in wormhole space. When the citadel is destroyed they are all ejected into space and can be killed. The killmails show who the 'owner' of the ship even if they wern't flying them at the time.
---
you can't possibly kick all the bad posters in GSF though

I mean, it would take a week!

Dumpster Co has been a waste as a coalition ever since their time in the South. Rather than build a power bloc people decided to follow Sort even though he has a history of sucking up to whatever power he can. This idea of your allies betraying Dumpster Co is a funny one since Sort pretty much backstabbed the group's that tried to save his space and coalition and for what so Darkness can get the lowest numbers out of their coalition.

I post ironically, Im not sure wally does (god i hope he does), I have never talked to him.
---
I respect rote so I wont shit talk you more, but why kick someone over fear of NC. who *might* help you out in the future.  Besides why would rote care if you got pushed out by nc.? Asset safety is a joke of a mechanic that ccp somehow allows to exist, and the rote i remember wasnt an industrial powerhouse so who cares.

Either the high grade crystal omega implant I got from a faction spawn and used to buy my first month of omega, or a very nice abyssal roll of a dead space micro warp drive. The only downside is that no one wants to pay 500 mil for a module to put on a frigate, so even if that’s a good value for it based on public contracts I haven’t been able to sell it for months

Based on how Snuff can't fight TRI on equal footing without batphones, I feel that the batphone comment is accurate.

Recycled comment, yikes. Pointed out the irony in the original posters message. You can be as dissatisfied or outraged as you want - that was dumb and this lawyer retort was dumb. In other news scams are morally reprehensible, thanks for posting.

Hey, I liked that guy.

Rote Kapelle, kicking problematic writers since 2015? ;-)

One he had already joined and left earlier. But if you want to nitpick the one corp he stayed in for any amount of time, compared to ALL the others, then sure :)

Why, his posts are almost as good as Darwins.

FNC is in fact OP. It needs its drones removed to balance it. That way if you want to keep the same dps you need to fit standard t2 dps rig and 2 hull rigs. There needs to be a tradeoff between huge tank of 3 t2 hull rigs and more dps oriented fits.

Imagine me, exploring out in the vast unknown of the lawless lands of null.

There is nothing, like literally nothing. I got through 15+ systems without a single relic site in sight. Tired and frustrated, I jump into a WH hoping to find something interesting.
---
After scanning down about a trillion gas sites I finally stumble on one, a sansha relic sites. "Cool" I thought "those have the intact armor plates", so I do them as usual and on the last container something magical happens. I see a BPC, a BPC for a rig, a capital-sized rig, and it's tech 2.
---
At this point i'm already picturing myself swimming in billions of isk, suiciding bling-fit battleships on Jita undock every other day because I don't even know what to do with the ridiculous wealth I've accrued.
---
Like every other rig in this game it's got a non-descript name, so I look up what it actually does to get an idea of how ridiculously rich I'm going to get.

The Gila "nerf" really wasn't much of a nerf at all. Their drones still do 500% damage. But now they only have 250% HP instead of 500% as well. So it means you need to be a little bit more cautious about not letting them die.
---
Story please.
---
There’s hatred towards the Chinese?
---
Maybe we can capitalize on this to ruin Fraternity space.

Well system is same you can Google it and resolve the problem

tldr; CCP needs to fix the UI of jump beacons. We should be able to disable ever seeing them. But the only way to get CCP to do anything is to abuse it. The dude jumped to my bait beacon. The gunner poked corp, I pinged. Dictors swarmed, he died.

Smoke screen covops + 3 targeting stabilizer rigs will get get your Targeting delay down to 2.76 seconds with cloaking v. At least one sebo in the mids. With good artillery skills and quake m you can get your alpha over 5k and will one shot most frigs and catalysts.

Epitome of a no tank glass cannon though so pick your situation carefully.

One good strategy is to wait at the next equally sized gate and look for the other signature to disappear, wait for the mission runner ship to appear at 1 au range on descan and then decloak, ready to go when they arrive.

100mn Blaster Tengus are fantastic... as long as you can afford to drop blinged oput carrier levels of isk on them, with abyssals one that actually works well is 4-5B
---
better game tbh
---
Im not talking about the drones alone Im talking about the ECM nerf as a whole.
---
The whole point of Trig weapons systems is the ramped up damage they do. On any other weapons system its just a temp drop from say an equivalent ship also doing 300 dps to 0 DPS for the duration of the lock then back to max damage. For trig its from, as you said, 800 to 0 for the duration of the lock then 300 and then slowly back to the max damage, with a chance they will not get back to the max because of said damps hitting again.
---
not wrong tbh
---
Covops, proj, intercalated, and either efficiency gate for mids or immobility for a defensive web (or overheat your web and web at like 50ish when you alpha)
---
Mids are mwd, no tank, sebos web/paints, lows all gyrostabs and a nano. Rigs will have to be prob 1 fitting rig for the 720s, maybe a shield extender and a polycarbon2.
---
You can align out litteraly as you uncloak, then after 5 s blap and warp if you need or get ready to blap again and kite
---
Some brief space law:
---
The relevant part of the EULA is under Section B, Passwords and Names
---
    No player may use the character name of another player to impersonate or falsely represent his or her identity.
---
Since both characters are owned by me, there is no issue, as there is no other player being impersonated. I'm sure there are lots of us who have similarly named alts for everything from indy to suicide ganking, for example. Of course it might be a problem if you pick a random newbie's name.
---
The relevant part of the TOS is Rule 8.
---
    You may not impersonate or present yourself to be a representative of CCP or an EVE Online volunteer. You may not impersonate or falsely present yourself to be a representative of another player, group of players, character or NPC entity.
---
Which shouldn't apply in this case so long as your smurf characters aren't named like, CCP_FaIcon or something.
---
In conclusion: it's OK!
---
i welcome this kind of content, too much PC lately
---
Its still a 20 sec cycle, only now its 5 second damp and a 15 wait until next damp ATTEMPT (Remember there has been no balance to this nerf, no increase in % chance the damps will hit to even the playing field a bit.

Ain't nothing wrong with mining.

It's being a wanker that's the bad bit
---
&gt;  At 60m an hour it takes a bunch of time to get enough isk for t2 cruisers and battleships
---
You could invest 20 billion into skilling, training a carrier and make 100m an hour or the same via rorqual. But than you need 200 hours of farming in EVE to recoup the startup costs. 
---
That and money making has been/is on the chop block so it's probably not the most intelligent investment. CCP (read korea) would like you to purchase 2 billion isk for the price of 500 plex. 
---
Your best bet is to buy ISK directly from CCP via purchasing plex with your credit card and redeeming it directly for ISK on the in-game market. You will be encouraged through game development to do this moving forward as this is the profit model the company has chosen to pursue.

This is EVE.

I miss the days of Co2 camping the gate.  So much random shit used to go down there.  Every day I'd log in loot the wrecks for some easy isk and wait till Project Mayhem to come by and cause some chaos.
---
😍
---
Its not a 5sec cycle, its a 5 sec damp with a 20 second cycle per attempt so if a damp lands the ship is damped for 5 sec but cant attempt another damp for 15 sec after. Also I wasnt talking about the drone nerf seperatly from the ECM nerf I was talking about the ECM nerf to both modules and Drones.
---
The level of hysteria in the sub about Chinese players is hilarious. It's like you people don't play the game any- oh wait mb

One night when i was in cloud ring i went to a line of two dead end systems that i called my garden. There would be atleast 4 relic site spawns in each these systems every so often. One tuesday night i saw some explorer tryna get in so i scared him off with my own astero. 
---
Went to quickly loot all the spawns and got approx 1.4bil in blue salvage within one hour of frantic hacking
---
Join a null sec group. Ask in here or r/evejobs. After that ask anyone how to salvage. You can get into it in a matter of hours
---
Yeah. When someone is behaving like this you shouldn't stoop to insults as well, it brings you down to his level and isn't worth it.

Correct this round of ECM nerfs are in. I cant wait to see what they have planned next to screw with it.

"Interim Statement on the Wallymarts Investigation:
---
"This week, on April 20 2019, we announced the permanent banning of Wallymarts and their ejection from the Council of Rote Kapelle. We also issued one-year bans to all other players involved in this incident and confiscated their associated in-game credibility and ISK.
---
"Following this statement, we have held further discussions with the affected Redditeers. We have also been conducting an internal review to substantiate the Reddit threads available to us and evaluate our handling of the situation. We intend to share a full follow-up statement next week.
---
"Transparency, fairness and trust is of utmost importance to us, which is why we’re issuing this brief update while also taking the time to ensure that we conduct a thorough investigation. We understand that there are many questions lingering over the incident, and we want to assure you that we take this matter very seriously. Both the sanctity of Reddit and the relationship we have with Wallymarts fucking tumblr page is of paramount importance to mouth-breathers everywhere.
---
"As should be expected, we will issue a full and frank apology for any mistakes for which we are responsible, as well as provide appropriate reparations to those affected by any erroneous actions we’ve taken."
---
"Discuss this Kapelle-blog on Reddit (ironically).

baited people on the plex beacon with dual web omen. a jaguar comes in with crazy tank. Meanwhile im trying to break his tank, 4 of his buddies in catalysts jump in. Since I coulnt do anything to the jaguar I tried my luck on a catalyst. It went down super fast - it was gank fitted. A few seconds later my ship goes boom :( So basically I tried baiting someone and get baited myself.

1. You consent to PVP and death when undocking. They gank for fun and for profit.  
---
2. People donate to CODE regularly to fund their antics, and like I said, ganking can be profitable. An Alpha can reliably gank in a Catalyst that cost 2 mil and be paid 3 mil Ship Replacement by James 315.  
---
3. The permit is a fraud. They will make up a reason to gank you if you have one and they want to.  
---
4. In theory, they create a climate of uncertainty that greatly affects new people but changes the way they play to prevent passive behavior. I don't mind the climate, minus the fact some new folks won't give EVE a chance as a result.  
---
5. Stop autopiloting, set CODE corps to red and watch local, align out early.  
---
6. Ships are fit for purpose. Train something to 5 while training general skills to 5. Then move to another after getting a few levels in a specialty ship. Or branch out to multiple things after lvl 4. Totally worthwhile.  
---
7. Most folks recognize CODE as a pirate group that gank miners for giggles and for loot because it's cheap, and they rarely can summon enough folks for a big kill as a group, so they do lots of small gang stuff.

Dear TD5K, 
---
Thank you for another long ass wall of text. Over a dozen people have confirmed what I've told you before: nobody finds your ideas worth listening to, mainly because you have no clue what the fuck you're talking about.
---
I told you previously that you need to make friends in-game to learn about the game. Based on your postings, I get the impression you have no friends in real life too. This isn't me trying to insult you: you need to honestly ask yourself why that is, and try to change it. The way you look on friendship (makings friends in a video game?! what a **horrible** thing to want!) is extremely strange and not a viewpoint a healthy, well-adjusted human being would have.
---
The fact is that what people like you need the most is to be frankly told the truth about themselves, it's the only thing that has a chance of helping you develop some self-awareness. **But my criticism of you is never personal**, it's only based on your behavior and actions. People can change, and if you change your behavior then you'll find the way other players treating you will change too.
---
The offer that I previously extended to you is still open. So are the cash bribes I've offered you for taking me up on it.
---
Hit me up, if you're man enough.
---
What kind of spinless moron kicks someone for shitposting on reddit? 
---
Oh wait...
---
Is the reputation you're talking about being ran by nc?
---
Because that's what it seems like
---
 I havnt played eve in 5 years, but this Is the quality shit posting that keeps me subbed to /r/eve
---
hey ab im gonna need u to stop posting. mr abkiller? more like mr toxic!
---
NSH mid-tier alliance...
---
Cool, I have a job too.
---
I last played eve 19/03/19, so this statement seems accurate.
---
So someone acted like an ass and that's somehow noteworthy?
---
Dst?
---
who?
---
Wally is good content. You aren't stopping him from Reddit posting, just stopping his affiliation with Rote.
---
No they only reimburse for verified (they know about it already) bugs.
---
Random server glitches get you a hard no. Been down that road already. It's the most ridiculous policy I have ever heard of.
---
In my case all enemies where killed but the gate refused to open. Gms told me to pound sand twice... Was told both times they don't know why the gate wouldn't open but because it's not a verified bug in the logs tough shit.
---
Nobody knows why just not a bug is all I was told over and over again.
---
Mote intel the safrr his at ships will be
---
the new jump beacons have ACLs like citadels, you can set them to public and they show up in literally everyone's jump to menu as long as they're in range
---
the interface is horrifically badly designed and it's very easy to click the wrong thing
---
a bait beacon is a public jump beacon set up in an area with a lot of jump traffic, usually on a well-equipped anti-cap fit citadel that can safely kill anything that jumps to it without being at risk (due to vulnerability windows)
---

I've been in the same corp with wally and know he's a retard, but why would someone start hitting your structures over some shit tier reddit posting? That's even more retarded than wally. Should've just told him that his posting sucks and he's kicked.

Holy shit soyboy Rote directorate lol

Good riddance for Wally

Personally it's coming across a player wreck in J space and selling the booster within for 4bil and living off it for a few years
---
I'm training into a rorq. I've been carrier ratting in a thank for isk. I don't mind mining at all. So the question is which one of the two is more profitable at this moment in time.
---
500mn nado is crazy, you can land 50km off a fight and align out and if people start burning at you they have no transversal anymore and you hit them with full application.
---
oh really?

Yeah his posting is terrible but it's still a terrible reason to kick someone.
---
One must ask what he must do to make it on one of these lists. Was this because I killed Lumio (DBUH).
---
LOOOOOOL
---
*hearty chuckle*
---
So cute :-)
---
Maybe not the most impressive, but I once got 10k of Nanite Paste from an offline SMA. It lasted for a long time, after 3 years of playing I haven't burned through even half of it.

It is, but I can understand your need to not feel dumb.

They can come up with jump fatigue to cap (pun intended,) force projection...

But they won't come up with Injector fatigue to curb the incentive to not?

In all honesty, would it be so bad if injectors only got you to level 4 of any skill?

We could go looking for a final solution, but there are historic references to that idea that are decidedly less than charitable.

Dumb noob question here. In HiSec Amarr space there are often blood raider FOBs is this the Gurista's version of that? I was always under the impression that the FOBs that randomly pop up are always blood raider.
---
It would be nice to know that other factions do the same thing in other regions of space.
---
So hard to explain what does it mean name of our corp cause it's russian meme. Also are you seriously see no difference between cheeky and insults like this?

It is you who does not understand that things don't get funded without a law authorizing it.

My dude, don't try to rationalize with him. He picked up extra chromosomes on sale.

Serious reddit posting consequences
---
No, he's meant kick it. It's a long weekend, he's earned it.

The guy was told something by leadership, he bucked. Why do you give so much of a shit about the reasons why?

Leader: dont do x

He doesn't

Garric gets mad that Wally has more Reddit karma than him. This causes Garric to get very angry. When His Almost Holiness Bob asks what the problem is, Garric responds with:
---
"I LIKED K-MART BETTER!"
---
Which leads to a suggestion to kick Wallymarts from Rote Kapelle. 
---
Seeing his chance, Garric the Bane journeys to the land of Reddit to use his newfound power to strike a second blow to Wally the Martsman. The thievery of his karma through dank leeqs. 
---
WILL OUR HERO WALLY SURVIVE? WILL GARRIC THE BANE OVERWHELM HIS REDDIT KARMA? TUNE IN NEXT TIME!

It's pretty easy to avoid getting caught by an already cloaked Astero, they take ages to be allowed to target again after de-cloaking.
---
I think shit talking is apart of the game. 
---
Unpopular Opinion: No one should be banned for saying retarded shit when you can simply block them from your life. I'll be censoring the players names from now on when I post my own personal salt fountains. I don't want people getting kicked for being ass hurt after I proded them for comment.

Couple of [pretty solid](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001560/201904140100/) fights related to The Spire that you could have linked. Nice write up all the same.
---
I think the part "NC. has been telling us, our strong independant alliance, they are annoyed by your posting". Apparantly being an utter cunt on comms was fine untill that happened.
---
But then again, if we banned people on reddit for what they did on alliance comms, we wouldn't be having this conversation :P
---
I completely agree, just totally forgot honestly. Sometimes it is hard to remember when I get linked all these BR's. But keep blowing up space pixels and next time I hope to catch it :)

It's a nice little racketing job you guys have going tbh, beg to run the by promising a cut to allaince leaders or camp the fuck out of them with a load of sabres and dsts.

Not sure who deserves the Darwin Arward of today. The PL Titan biting the Neutrale M-O Freighter Bait ? The TAPI Nyx Jumping to the beacon ? The INIT Nyx falling for the Fleet Invite from Headhunter Jax in 1DQ ? Or is it the Ragnarok in Fountain ? You decide

Make one each for: Incursions, DPS F1 Monkey (Turrets), DPS F1 Monkey (Missiles), Tackle, etc.  Train them all towards their role.

Then you'll be able to participate in most things.  Do Project Discovery or Exploration to get your seed money to fly a meta Incursion Hyperion.  You'll make plenty off of just a bit of Incursion running to party for alpha ships.
---
I'm calling shenanigans
---
No, that's my girl! I'll fight you! :p
---
Yes. In Hisec you get pirate faction FOBs, in nullsec you get pirate faction Sotiyos. Same idea but much bigger. AFAIK all of the main pirate factions can spawn both FOBs and Sotiyos in their respective territories.

I got myself a new mouse with lots of buttons and multiple profiles. I programmed it up and decided to test it and memorize the buttons by running low level sites in hi sec. I went to a Sansha Refuge(really basic hisec anomaly) and it spawned a faction ship that dropped a module worth 208m ISK. Can't remember what the module was now but it hasn't happened again (and I have tried really hard).
---
I can't put my finger on it but something tells me you might actually be fabio....
---
Someone max rolled the top officer web. With a hugin and boosts, it reached out to touch you at 169km. Still had a good speed reduction. 
---
Max rolls are hilarious.
---
What? That was just sitting around?
---
Sweet. While the game's going downhill, the visuals are just too damn good. If only there were more visual effects of the various modules (Instead of just some faint glow for sensor boosters, hardeners etc).
---
Yeah, just have to understand that your engagement profile is fairly small, unless I am mistaken, you will probably never be able to take on an Astero that even has a somewhat shitty fit, unless it is mostly warp-stabs or some garbage. I did this once and used light missiles, but blasters would probably work a lot better.

You are a cocksucker though so it's pretty believable

---
What are the effects of EWAR modules on larger ships when the EWAR is from a frigate class for example? Can a crucifier have the same effect on a battleships weapons that it would have on a frigates, since it is percentage based? Or is there another stat that makes it easier for larger ships to resist smaller ships ewar modules?
---
I was doing relic and data sites in my home holes chain, found a ghost site (never successfully did one in a WH before, only known space). I hacked one of the cans and got a BPC for some implant, later found out after checking the Jita market that it was worth a little over 3.5 bil.

It took quite a while to sell, slow moving high cost item and all, but it did sell, most valuable single item I had sold so far.

I remember one of my new scanners in my corp found a shattered wormhole connected to our home, they did not want to do the hacking of the like 40-50 relics and data sites that were in there. So I did them myself and made like 2 bil or some shit, it took quite a while, but was totally worth it, I did tip them fairly well for their efforts of scanning.

What were you flying around that you were able to take them right then? I figure those special rats are pretty tough.
---
Crucifiers and such still apply fully to everything except seiged dreads and marauders. If anything they’re more effective on big ships because they have larger base stats so losing 33% of their range hurts more.
---
I usually create a perch 150km+ away from the nearest can so I can warp to any can. I sit two ships waiting for an explorer. Warp in the fast locker, uncloaking as I hit warp to save on cloak delay. Lock the ship, neut at the same time then warp in the kill ship and kill.

You should look into what Thera is, as well as EvE Scout. If you enjoy exploring Null-sec and different parts of it, using the EvE Scout website to find Thera connections and using Thera to get to different deep parts of Null-sec is really time efficient and fun.

o7 bro, how goes it?
---
Unless you are mining some of the best moon ores, the thanny will be better ISK/hr. The main advantage to the rorqu is that it requires significantly less attention when mining, and as such can be easily scaled and can be used to make ISK while you do other things.

Have you tried turning it off and on again?

It is certainly a challenging and complex question. We already know the real part; we still have to find the imaginary part

As someone who camps in a dual scram rocket nemesis, the majority of asteros are completely shitfit. Tons of nanos for no apparent reason, two or three stabs, no defensive web/scram, no drones besides 3 flights of EC-300s.

You do know that X47 was NC.'s Keepstar, not ours right? So if anything it was us that moved our superfleet and helped them defend. DW- was CO2's keepstar not ours, so once again that's us helping too. Then when GS actually killed all the keepstars in Fade, guess who was the only one to form a defence fleet on that night? I'll give you a hint, it wasn't CO2, NC. or PH. Granted we couldn't do anything except die horribly to Goons supercapitals, but we were there.  
---
Like why is it okay to say NC. moved their shit to help, but when technically it's us moving ours that gets ignored? PH brought *fucking nothing* but burst jamming interceptors to '*help'*  in most big fights but they get a pass right?   
---
It's just GOTG that is the bad ally that never shows up (conveniently ignoring [all the evidence](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9m01t4/the_war_in_numbers/e7bnqdf/?context=3) showing we brought numbers to every  major objective) and somehow we're the shitheads for finding new allies when the rest of our old ones decided to kick us while we're already obviously downed. Seems legit.

That's pretty surprising to me, how long does it take you to kill those sorts of fits with rockets fit?

Gate camps are almost non-existent when you get outside of the first few jumps from Low-sec into null-sec. That's why I like using Thera Wormholes so much to get into and out of null, I don't even have to deal with the vast majority of these gate-camps.

It is a good skill to learn how to avoid and evade a camped gate though, book-marks are your friend.

---
Maybe 20-30 seconds? I’m not really sure, I haven’t done it in a while. 
---
One thing I do which might help is I camp in nullsec. So, everyone there who’s half decent uses zkill tank, which means you have to wait until you have no kills/losses of anything exploration related that look scary on the front of your zkill. So, maybe there are easier targets in nullsec, but you also can’t camp more than maybe once a week, and if you die in an exploration astero with scram fit then you also need to get that off your zkill.
---
When they were worth doing. People didnt use rattlers..
---
Eve is a beautiful game
---
i used to farm angle 10's and would always sperg seeing that 1.2b pop up.
---
of course when you would run 2 back to back and only make 20m it kinda felt horrible.
---
My buddy got a fully fit rorqual from the hardknocks keepstar drop. At the time it was worth 10bill give or take.
---
Yeah, that's why I personally like Wormhole hunting a lot more, there is really no zkill tanking. It can be really hit or miss though, you can wait for 10 minutes and get a nice fish, or it could be 4 hours and nothing. I just generally dislike having local in general, except when i'm exploring or course, ha.

What's the difference between standard, web, and scram kiting.
---
I’m gonna have to go with dropping a titan on a freighter, the result seems well deserved
---
Free Range Organic Non-GMO Pink Himalaya Sea Salt!
---
Just do it with Titans. No fear.
---
Kiting generally means fighting at a range where you can hit your opponent but they can't reach you. Scram kiting involves staying just inside scram range, using an afterburner to kite while your scram keeps their MWD turned off. Web kiting involves staying a bit farther than that, and using a defensive web to slow down your opponent if they get too close. "Standard" kiting is a catch-all term for max range kiting. Sometimes it'll be in point range, using an MWD to keep your distance. Sometimes it'll be longer range still, counting on other factors to keep your target on grid. (Kiting fleets do the latter, and use separate tackle ships such as Sabres to keep their opponents from leaving.)

If you aren't using Fixed Window... then yes, it's going to have a frame around it. Because that's how Windows works. It's got nothing to do with Eve, that's an OS function.

Yeah, I was expecting an OS solution. I can't find anything on Google, but was hoping someone might have made some kind of program to do it.
---
Yeah, but new characters are free
---
It is, though if you sub briefly and decide you really like some of the higher tech-level ships and gear, you might get frustrated if/when the sub expires and you lose access. To clarify, your higher tech-level gear isn't destroyed or otherwise lost if your sub expires, but you can no longer use that gear until you resub.
---
If you don't sub though, the experience is pretty good. No pressure to make ISK (in-game currency) to 'justify' the sub or try to keep it "Plexed" (which is using your in-game currency to pay for in-game time without paying real money). Making ISK is harder as an alpha as you won't have access to the best gear for whatever task you're doing to grind, but it's much more casual in a good way.
---
Actual combat is pretty much unrestricted if you do anything roam-style, and most basic (T1/Faction/Pirate) Ship fleet comps (fleets used by large corporations and alliances) are accessible.
---
The one thing to know his that when you start out, you are VERY disadvantaged money-wise until you start getting your first few million ISK which allows you to can buy a ship that can really do the grind. Don't be afraid to ask for help from your friends to get started, as even 50-100 million isk is less than chump change for some people. They'll probably also help you improve your ship's fitting which will help a lot.
---
Good luck! Hope to see you in space.

I had just had a wisdom tooth removed (I reacted bad, 4 days til I could open my jaw properly again) and a prescription for Norco, along with 6 days before work again. 
---
I started my officer grind out in the drone regions. We had a -.9 belt system.
---
After 4 8-12 hour days, he (it?) finally spawned, and dropped about 15bil in loot.
---
np!
---

---
kill efficiency is literally what you're talking about
---
Wait, Rote Kapelle is still alive? Huh... well would you look at that! Glad to see Rote 'Can I be your pet' is "not" bending knees and "not blueing blocs" still.

About research: Is there an advantage to researching in a POS rather than an NPC station where I have high standing?
---
align
---
mjd
---
spam warp
---
What a heckin bamboozle
---
Lets expand this to: Don't step outside or open the internet if you don't have thick skin.
---
That doesn't matter in this case. If someone lands a scram the mjd is off, period. Then you have to burn outta the bubble with an ab. The only thing wcs do is allow warp when tackled, assuming wcs strength is high enough.

If stupid Reddit posts are a reason to ref structures then a great many people will soon be homeless.
---
They spent 2 years planning this sotiyo destruction
---
Yeah of course there definitely won't be a dictor, of course!
---
Is that even though a DST has a +2 hull bonus to warp core strength?
---
Glad to help. Actually provi just ate shit in a mach fleet trying to defend an ihub a few minutes ago. https://br.inyour.space/?s=3730&amp;b=8573580&amp;e=330&amp;t=quevfb

The comparison between wormholes and nullsec is the same as compasrion from nullsec to highsec. It's how Eve should be played.
---
Why are you sticky?
---
2 vnis.
---
3 vnis.
---
4 vnis.
---
5 vnis.

Harder now that Plex is more expensive but you see where this is going. The actual "next step" is a  carrier (forget rattle, to get worthwhile returns you have to bring until you could have had a carrier). Multiboxing will get you the carrier faster, and if you have solid apm you can do 1x carrier (later, 1x super) and maintain the 4 vnis which will all eventually graduate to ishtars.
---
For a second I thought that was a big ass crater on the planet in the background.
---
Is that the case even with the hull bonus of +2 warp core strength?
---
WTF dude... Belt rats IN HAS dropping 400M isk loot?!
---
I call this bullshit!!! ò.ó
---
How's the PVP? What things do wormhole fleets usually kill?
