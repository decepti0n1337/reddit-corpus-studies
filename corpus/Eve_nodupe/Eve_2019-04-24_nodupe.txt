discord link is down, who do i contract my assets to interim

---
---
yeah, those idiots dont deserve the legendary CPC (Canadian Political Correctness)
---
Maybe Horde should tell them to stop firing on the structure and hold their dps a little so they can adjust the response to appropriate levels, right?
---
?
---
&gt;Still only five corporations are responsible for 50 percent of the wardecs.
---

---
there is no reason why this is an issue.
---
&gt;Totally different thing outside of highsec. Something is wrong.
---
debatable
---
&gt;It is too easy currently to avoid losing ships as an aggressor.
---
welcome to eve, the same mechanics here are due to things not related to the wardec system
---
Thanks a lot for this response! I just got back into PC gaming so I’m playing MGS V and Elite Dangerous atm. 
---
I may PM you when I go to play it, so you can at least get a bonus from the referral code.
---
No, even by the article, it seems like he was a full employee...

far shoot an most likely not it but it sounds like a ol norwegian  tale about how the seas got salty. called ''kvernen som maler på havets bunn'' or the salt shaker who spills at the bottom of the sea.

didd 20 mins of googling in both english an norwegian, no luck

Karmafleet is recruiting

I grabbed it when they announced the new character creator.

Where’s the 800 word aar
---
There's no issue with bringing a full response fleet. Your taking the piss when they then decide to post a chestbeating AAR claiming amazing 'Within EMP Range" piloting by the Horde FC with no mention of dropping capitals.
---
You are wrong.  Ask your parents about UO.

Sodium != salt btw

*Buy my plex plox

I don't understand, I need to change my overview in order to change my dscan ?
---
CCP doesn't sell it exclusively, they have a list of verified resellers on their website.
---
Yes
---
I somehow see a lot of timers being created for each episode left, that wouldn't have existed if not for this post.
---
truly this is known.
---
Im the only one who realize that injector prices being to damn high is slowly getting eve at its inicial state where there wasn't injectors cuz newbies or ppl who pay their mouths with isk can affort them. Im think that injectors prices this high are actually (just injectors) good for the game
---
Time to anchor 50 astrahus somewhere
---
Need to take more to get to the sweet spot. Then more to stay there. Then more because the hangar needs rearranging again.
---
Goal: fill it up and take a shake out for every in game salt you get, empty the salt shaker
---
If you can't tell the truth then we are done here Minerva
---
retard alert
---
But Eve's claim to fame has always been that they allow the player to do the unintended.  They've marketed themselves that way.  You can prefer that they didn't exist, but CCP can't, otherwise it's a different game.

Hi, FCB member here.  RMT was a bannable offence if caught.  They just didn't try that hard.  A member of the FCB was banned for buying gold.
---
Are you spinning the camera to see the 3rd dimension?
---
I always see that pissing and moaning about bubbles. They aren't that bad. If they are truly ruining your null experience maybe your not as good at this game as you think.
---
He said Horde dropped caps on the brawl, dude. Am I missing something here?
---
of course
---
You're using spread formation, stop doing that. For PVE you ONLY use pinpoint formation. Spread is only useful when you're looking for "pvp targets" to see if there's anything in the system.
---
 snuff has the resources (wh probers), intel (spais) and a competent fc team (autists) to go find content wherever it may be, and with that they may as well live in LS where they dont face the risk of being waterboarded by bubbles for bigger fisher to come dunk them.
---
"Dropped caps as we began brawling."
---
as I said in the title, I am using both. I tried spread as a last ditch effort before posting this.

Yea their economist was retarded. Did the moon goo changes and even though even pointed out it was dumb and that promethium would be stupid they still did it. Also inflation continued to rise to stupid amounts, and there was tons of other bullshit too.
---
EvE economist did nothing good :|
---
thanks, I'll give it a shot next time. I've moved on from this system in frusteration
---
I'll get a screenshot later for you to compare to :)
---
Steam works great. Steam working with Eve/CCP not so great.
---
Skill up or spend more isk or use mods or two or three of these depending on where you are in New Eden
---
lol
---
The picture shows spread formation, you always get 0% there. If you don't get any hit with pinpoint you're doing it very wrong. If you really want to do it step by step do the following
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\- look at the system map from the side, drag the probe cluster to the same height as the middle of the red sphere
---
\- look top down, now move the probe cluster to the middle of the red sphere
---
\- increase the probe size so that the inner overlap of all the probe spheres, where all probes intersect, completely encompass the red sphere
---
\- scan
---
\- 1) look at system map from the side, adjust vertical 
---
\- look top down, adjust again
---
\- make probes one size smaller, scan again
---
\- go back to 1) and keep doing this till you get a 100% hit.
---
My mistake, he still thinks far too highly of himself for what he pulled off. It wasn't some herculean task.

As long as you understand the full import of your first two words. "My opinion"  Then you may want to ask yourself some other questions. 
---
If your opinion was wrong, would you want to be corrected? (Opinions can indeed be wrong when they are based on incorrect facts, logic, or assumptions)
---
What would it take to change your opinion? And is that a reasonable amount of effort and evidence or is your opinion unchangeable in the face of overwhelming oppositional facts, etc. 
---
What evidence outside of your own personal experience and life do you have to base your opinion on? 
---
This is diverging from my point on RMT and GameTime items(PLEX) being necessary for game development not because developers want them, but because customers demand them. The MMO genre developed without RMT and no developer initially made an RMT type service. Those services were initially developed by third parties because of demand. It's like Cars and Cup Holders. No cars had them originally and no car designers made them, until someone saw customers making their own, and then built them in, now it's almost impossible to buy a car that doesn't have one because it's what the vast silent majority want.
---
I didn't know that was a thing. I'll post it there. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
&gt; Now you tell me how you go around finding a fight.
---
Depends on if you want to welp or not. I only fly T2 fit stuff tho and 1-2% implants. But i would fly to an enemy system, anchor a bunch of bubbles and attack anything that comes in until the response is strong enough to crush us.
---
because the magic man in the sky wanted to fuck with your head.
---
I tried this as well and actually only got 2 out of 6 with carriers even on the page without scrolling (didn't scroll to see if any were there).

Fuck yes! Intaki long hair pride forever!

You don't just afk on EVE all the time?
---
I understand you probably started playing post-renaissance or something and just have no fucking clue what you’re talking about.  Stupid trammies should stay in your lane.
---
Uhhuh. I started playing when there was only Felucca. Great Lakes. After the split I moved to Siege as well.
---
yeah sure, I've been doing that more or less, but when I see this red dotted circle I assumed it meant I had to scan everywhere in that circle. Am I misinterpreting this?
---
Mate, I’ve seen people here make AAR’s on dropping titans on swordfleets while covered by umbrella standings. All full of videos, memes, laughs and name calling. This is nothing.
---
Its an AAR on a random fight. Nothing more, nothing less.
---
Game of Thrones? That the new Marvel movie?
---
If you see a circle that means only one probe is on the target so you didn't position correctly.
---
You *could* just try positioning again and again but I found that if you "lost" the target it's just better, faster and less frustrating by upping the probe size again and taking it from there.
---
Maybe your home is a bit shit if you can't find pvp from it without broken jump gates?
---
Jesus do any of them know what an adc is?

At first, I was like omfg shoot the stiletto he is so fucking dead! Then I realized you had ac's.

Lies.
---
Level V scan difficulty most likely.  Your scan strength is too low.  Level up your scanning skills and/or use some mods to improve it then you'll probably get it.  Once you do you'll probably find it's a superior sleep cache or ghost site. 
---
Also could be a site that despawned while you were scanning?
---
Well, you could always 3d print some "fan art", right?
---
&gt;Anchor in this alliance most commonly means to orbit the anchor at 2500 meters.     
---
Hol up, what?
---
Fake news
---
Getting 0% hits has nothing to do with skills being too low. A despawned site is removed from the scanning window.
---
My God do that many people really care that much about Got?
---
Yes. The sphere and the circle represent the possible range the signature might be in. But they ALSO represent the number of "hits" the probes deliver. A sphere, for example, means that only one probe has detected the signature, a circle means two probes have "hit," and a line means three.
---
What this means is that when you get a circle, you should move your probes to the opposite side of the circle (since your probes should be within the circle), since the circle will be in the direction of the single probe which hit, and if it were closer to the center then another probe would have been activated, causing a line. You should collapse your distance by one stage at this time, too.
---
With a line, a similar logic applies: always center your probes over the far circle, since if the signature was at the closer circle, an additional probe would have been tripped. Collapse your probes also in this case, to at least half the width of the line.
---
Spheres are trickier, since a single probe being tripped could mean it's anywhere on a line between the closest probe to the center and the center of the sphere. However, a useful thing to remember in this case is that signatures always spawn within 4 AU of a celestial. So, if you're having trouble getting increased accuracy with a larger radius, collapse your radius to around half the diameter of the sphere, and center your probes about halfway between the center of the sphere and the closest planet. 
---
Additionally, there ARE some sites that will remain "unscannable" without high skills. levels 3 and 4 in most scanning skills will suffice for regular data and relic sites (even up to IV difficulty), but more exotic sites like sleeper caches and higher level ghost sites will not be possible without higher skills or specialized ships/modules. These sites are listed as level IV but are significantly harder to scan than the regular level IV data and relic sites.

Supercap movement speed seems to be in a pretty decent place but 13 mins from D-P to 08 in a standard test bomb dread with a 500mn fit using the JB route is a bit much. I use that route most every day and it's broken. IMO JBs should be more the sort of help they are out in feythabolis: they are nice when you can use them but cut like 20% of the trip off instead of 75%.

Thank you (:

Hey thanks for typing that all out, that was really helpful! (:

Weird flex but ok

it has omni resist that works out to be about equal to the average of the other t1 battleships resists, also if anything its better because it has no resist hole to exploit

As it has been pointed out multiple times in multiple threads at this point it has been 6 plus months since a meaning price discount on PLEX from any outlet, meaning the amount of PLEX sales has correspondingly dropped just like it always does when there is a sale on. I can't help it if you don't bother to educate yourself on the background of the topic you chose to speak about on reddit and I got tired of holding your hand so responded sarcastically. Maybe you could go read some of the endless threads that have already been posted on the topic?

&gt;I want to start doing L1 missions in Hi-Sec so I can eventually start doing L3 and maybe L4 missions. My question is does it really matter where in the universe and for which faction I start doing these? Do I just pick an area in the map and do missions there? I know it's worth considering which enemy NPCs are in that area but is there more to it? Thanks!
---
Start by running missions for Caldari Navy, as you progress to level 2-3 and higher pull away from Jita / Forge area as your ships will become more expensive.
---
Keep an eye on your faction standings cause your opposite ones will be taking a dive, avoid missions that go against main factions such as Amarr, Gallente Minmatar Caldari or you will get to the point where their navies will be shooting at you.
---
Best for Caldari starters are missile /shield ships, like Kestrel and Caracal.
---
this is call nullsec and as a matter of fact yes we have closer target but I hate bringing my corp against QFC or TEST

How can I make decent money while mining? I ventured into a 0.4 sec system for the first time and started mining there so I could find more valuable ore. There was one other person in the system who attacked me within a few minutes of me starting mining. I took a cheap ship so I don't care about losing it, but is it possible to make isk while mining? Should I expect that people will attack me every time I venture into a system below 0.5 sec, even though I am in a shitty venture mining frigate? What even is the point of bothering a low level mining frigate, besides the fun of being a dick?
---
What about salvaging? Is that a better way to make money for a newer player?
---
You forgot the antibiotics and the janitor.

This would get 1000+ more upvotes if it was a Spaceballs gif with subtitles.

I'd say its very good at wormhole PVE up to C3.  90% of the DPS of a Rattle at 1/3 the cost and can tank all the C3 sites without warp off.  It probably depends on how often you get ganked if Praxis or Rattle is better isk/hr wise.
---
you think if horde stupidly fed nearly 25b of hacs to darkness in deklein they wouldn't post about it?
---
I mean that's just claiming ignorance which usually doesn't work too often. CCP can't police every site that comes out but they can't enforce the penalty to the players with the ingame items.
---
Man this TV usually sells for $500 but this guy is selling one for a 
---
 $200 discount he must be a legit re-seller having a sale.
---
Here are my two cents:
---
Inflation is inevitable, but that only means the decrements of ISK value.
---
I turn my ISK into PLEX or other merchandises from time to time and only turn them back to ISK when I actually need to buy stuffs.
---
When you keep your earns in items or PLEX, they don't care inflation since their est price go up as well.
---
If you're not those merchants sitting in Jita all day performing leverage, I'd suggest you just buy PLEX or whatever you might need in near future. Don't keep a lot of ISK in hand since ISK is expected to inflate at least 2x in the following 12 months.
---
Right! PH isn’t allowed to blob like everyone else. Thanks for reminding them
---
And they'd be just as sad.
---
Man your so brave The lack of people talking about botting on this sub is appalling and we need more heroes like you to show CCP that it is a hidden problem that needs more light on it.

Where do you guys usually operate

lmao, embrace the pvp
---
So you only want to be dropped by people you can counter?
---
Praxis is very good solo battleship, and very few people do solo battleship pvp stuff.
---
Fast align time, many utility mid slot, gigantic cargo give more survivality when you’re solo.
---
But it has clear downsides and kinda bad in fleet, so no wonder why ppl think praxis is shit.
---
Personally praxis is my favorite BS.
---
&gt; Sitting cloaked up at a safe off a gate providing intel to the rest of your "elite gang" of ratter hunters who tuck tail and flee if any resistance undocks is absolutely risk free to you
---
Crazy that intel (scouts) can give someone an edge
---
Maybe some Plex you can roll up to snort the Jump Fatigue.
---
A lot of new players make great money scanning down relic and data sites in exploration. If you are brave enough to venture out to 0.0, it can pay extremely well! Even lowsec and wormhole sites can be quite nice.
---
If you are Gallente, you could look into a passive shield Vexor and run T1 abyssal filaments to start. A Gila would be the end goal here but a Vexor would get you going.
---
I cant speak to mining as it isn't my thing, but the 2 things above are great money for the challenge required.

As your FC I advise you to fly at top speed and it'll be a Goddamn miracle if we get there before you turn into some kind of wormholer. Are you ready for that? Docking in a lowsec bait citadel under a phony corp with the intent to blockade run on a head full of exile? I sure hope so...
---
mind telling me some of those downsides?
---
Thanks! Can you explain a bit what "scanning down relic and data sites" means and how I would get started doing that? 
---
Is there something I could get that would cloak my ship and allow me to do some mining undetected as long as I didn't attack anyone or something like that?
---
You do that by increasing the size of the scan, not by spreading all the probes out.
---
I must be doing it wrong. Pay my sub, don't worry about plex, buy things, sell then for more than I paid for, ?, profit
---
This capsuleer knows opportunity costs...

It's moments like this that you need China.

Priorities are strong with this one.
---
Armor RHML Praxis are pretty dope, I've tried to make a torp shield tank fit but I havent been successful as of yet. 
---
Fleet wise they are ok, but they do make a good suit case. You can fit them to align at 4 sec with 2.5 k hold.
---
Let's see...I bought 50 something injectors for my buddies for xmas presents, a titan, a titans worth of officer  mods for said titan and set a 3rd toon training into another titan.  All in like the last week of December. All in all it was like 5% of what I've got. Btw..already made that back and then some. No poors plox.

can i pay you for custom fanfic

While the fight itself is nothing to write home (or reddit) about the part that I do like is that it was alliance vs alliance. This is quite rare nowadays, even more so when numbers go over 100.

Trolled hard, time cant get back. Damn...

Good luck getting CCP to wake up and realize this can be a source of income. Especially since ... tada... they don't need to deal with creation and distribution. All they need to do is get royalties... But hey...

Everyone missed the point: "Beans had good fire control" ... think the Horde FC is trolling Sapparo Jones.
---
he should focus on botting.
---
They *are* Chinese. If you want cheap knockoffs any old sweatshop will work. But just like anywhere else you get what you pay for, and the high quality models are produced by companies that (tend to) follow copyright law since they want the major publisher contracts.
---
Why specifically do you think this (or an equivalent adjustment) would be a net-negative for the game overall? I'm genuinely curious to hearing opposed reasoning.
---
It's the slowest battleship in the game. (as with all SOCT ships being slowest in their class)  
---
It's uniform resists make it alright for lowclass wormhole PvE but for PvE in kspace or where wanting strong specific resists it falls short even compared to T1 battleships.
---
Its performance with each weapon system is subpar compared to racial ships dedicated to their weapon systems. (but its pretty good drones help it out a lot in that respect)
---
As /u/oldman_stone said its the jack of all trades master of none ship.
---
what if you just, you know... defend yourself against gankers
---
what if you had capitals on standby, maybe in a fleet, and they could teleport to the guy getting ganked instantly with no possible counterplay by the ganker other than killing the target before the can push 1 button
---
that would be silly, huh
---
Wall of text for nothing...just had to say "I hate cloaky campers and cant figure out how to play the game with them around." Something like that.
---
Basically it's fat and slow - the base speed is terrible. You can't run a good kite setup and will have trouble keeping stuff under scram/web if it's got an afterburner. Since range control is so important, this is bad for basically every fitting option. 
---
The '7 lowslots' are also a lie since you need 3 coprocs to fit most fittings on it. With a bit more fitting room it could actually be good instead of just okay.
---
Fair enough, and very true.
---
That depends. What kind of fanfic were you looking for?
---
It's been around for a while, its just like scanning down a wormhole, warping to it &amp; there's nothing there
---
Enjoy upvote
---
I'm just against changing mechanics that can already be countered with awareness
---
1) Everyone talks about countering Cloaks, forgetting that Cloaks are a counter. To always being visible in space. Without the ability to stay cloaked for long periods, there would be no way to observe your enemy. The only way to spy would be through infiltration.
---
2) Parking a single cloaked ship doesn't cripple operations for an entire Alliance. Local chat telling you there is a single cloaked ship, is what cripples them. Local needs to be nerfed, not cloaking. If you didn't know there was a stranger, you'd always have to be vigilant and defensive. Instead, we've got bots that immediately turtle up when a name enters chat.
---
3) If a cloaked ship is literally just floating in some distant corner, then they aren't harming anyone or anything. There is no reason to nerf them because they're just floating in space.
---
4) If there actually is someone at the helm. And they actually are planning on doing something (whether it's spying, or getting ready to strike), then that's also legit gameplay. There's no reason to nerf someone when they're planning something. Just like we don't nerf how long people are allowed to target another ship. Cloaking isn't an aggressive action. It's the precursor to aggressive action.
---
Well sass wasn't necessary hehe, but this is pretty much the main response I when I talk to some of my friends about it get so I'll try to tackle it directly.
---
The jist is that I have to have people on stand by in expensive high skill ships, and make a not insubstantial organized effort and generally just do quite a bit additional work just to play the game, not to mention risking a counter drop that my Corp and I aren't capable of handling. I have to do all that anytime I want to do anything in my own home, while the person making me have to do it almost nothing. They do little to no work, and make someone else have to do quite a bit of work. 
---
I understand that there's counterplay, I said that plainly in my post, but it's not remotely equivalent exchange of effort or resources, and that doesn't seem like good gameplay design to me.
---
Man I get where you’re coming from and all. But grow up and join a wormhole corp. like.
---
In wormholes you are always being watched by cloaky eyes. Hell. People get alts to put in helios’s.
---
Like I get that hot drops are annoying and all. But come on man. Don’t just throw wormholes under the bus again cause your content isn’t the exact way you want it.
---
Because more than just cloaky campers use cloaks for long periods of time. Like. I often leave my cloaked helios near a wormhole and forget about it. But it doesn’t matter because theres no local.
---
shut up
---
&gt;  a nano fleet isn't gonna sit there and die there gonna bail the moment anything big shows up
---
What is the point then? I do not understand. You aren't fighting if you are just running all the time.
---
&gt;get dropped.
---
Is this not the point of going to enemy space and spanking people and making noise?
---
Those are some very good points. I can see that changes to local might be a way better avenue for balancing this kind of activity.
---
Khanid, Gehi System, on the cusp of Null Sec &amp; Hi Sec
---
Peace and respect friend o7
---
That's a solid point, and suggests that there's probably a less drastic change that could be made to a system or mechanic to even out the issue. Thanks for commenting.
---
You have really low Scan strength. You need around 100 to scan down all the hardest sigs(?) or maybe to two scan. Either way. General rule of thumb is you want around 100+ probe strength. I rock 197 on my scanner.
---
just remove localo
---
Nullsec iş already extremely safe. In some regions you can sustainably kill supers only relying on afk camping. Given all kinds of bad macroeconomic effects of unchecked ultra safe anomaly farm, why are you entitled to even more safety?
---
You should add that Anveri Vestigo is a supreme weeb
---
you get to bring infinite ships from anywhere in your entire coalitions jump bridge network instantly and the attackers get to bring whatever they can jump into range until cynos are jammed
---
yeah, you're right, it doesn't seem like a remotely equivalent exchange of effort or resources. It doesn't look like good gameplay design to me either
---
I don't think I was being particularly juvenile or unreasonable. And I didn't demand anything just offered one possible suggestion.
---
That said you make a very good point, I didn't really consider the impact on wormhole space.
---
Frankly I made the title that suggestion in the hopes I would get some people posting real substantive opinions which thankfully you and other have.
---
However this doesn't really touch on the issues I raised. Perhaps if CCP deems that a change is warranted it would instead be a less drastic change to a different system, maybe Local as others here have mentioned.
---
Thanks for commenting o7
---
Thanks bro. I felt really strongly about this especially when they started to make these bad decisions and start diverting money away from eve. It really felt like I was paying to subsidize whatever the CCP developers fantasies were vs actually paying for the game.
---
I started playing in 2008 stop for a while and then came back in 2012. I really felt strongly thought this was the best game in the world, even to the point where it wasn't really a game more of a parallel universe that you could connect yourself to, in a sense. For a while I would like to half joke to acquaintances and Corpmates that Eve online truly was a different universe and one day we'll just plug our brains in and live in this alternate universe, since it's so much more comprehensive than any other video game.
---
Overtime I felt more and more disillusioned that CCP were, in essence, betraying the player base with their desire to treat Eve just like a money producing product instead of the first next level vision of computer-generated alternate universes. It might be there right to treat us like cash cows but it really stung and I thought CCP was better than that. So I quit in 2017
---
Others have mentioned this an I'm starting to think something along these lines would be a better option. Maybe make it wo you only appear in local if you're active?
---
Thanks for commenting.
---
Where did you get that from what i wrote?
---
You can 24/7 cloak to impede the playerbase from 24/7 krabbing. We're doing a service to internet spaceship society.
---
People go on and on about how things should have risk that give you benefit. Funny that.
---
Worth noting is defensive cloaks.
---
I’ve once piloted an Orca under cloak for about an hour under the nose of TDSIN when I went to evict a friend.
---
Also the few times you get rolled out while being hunted it’ll come in handy.
---
But why not just Have an activity timer? Like you must be this active to not get auto logged out.
---
That's fine, but drop the pretense that you are there for actual fights then.
---
Wait why are you getting downvoted? This is true as fuck.
---
Am I right?
---
Nah, I'm just joshin' ya.
---
On a structural level you make a very good point, but to a degree you are missing the forest for the trees. I suppose my issue is more with the threat posed. It's not about what each side is capable of doing, it's about what each side has to be prepared to do.
---
The defender, in theory can bring more in most scenarios, but it can't be expected that every member of alliance to has access to a bat phone anytime they want to play. The defender has to sit upright with their finger on the trigger to be prepared, while the camper is in complete control of when and where or if they commit, and aren't required to have friends online or ready to fight except at the exact moment they decide to drop. 
---
I appreciate your input o7
---
Personally, I'd love to see some changes to Local mechanics.
---
- High Sec can continue the way it is. Names appear immediately, b/c you're required to stay registered with the authorities.
---
- Low Sec would have your name appear immediately... if you entered the system through a Gate, b/c you had to register when you came through. If you jump into the system, your name doesn't appear until you speak in chat, or (complicated mechanic here) if you're observed by the authorities. And even then, your name disappears after 15min, or if you're noticed somewhere else. If you aren't noticed, your name could remain in a system you already left. =)
---
- Sov-less Null works like Wormholes. Nobody shows up unless they speak. And it disappears after 15 min.
---
- Sov Null can turn Local functions back on with Sov structures. Then it operates like Low Sec. And the Sov holders can use Standings or Access Lists to choose which people do and do not appear in Local when they're noticed. So you may jump into an "empty" system only to realize it's FULL of hostile locals.
---
a legit cunt maybe.
---
Ccp actually fixed this, you need mods/rigs/skills
---
Hehehe o7
---
Sure thing. Just hit me up if you do join and I can help you get started in game. Elite is pretty fun as well although not near as in depth/sandboxy for me. But definitely a challenging game and fun in its own right!
---
Those are some good points that bring some needed nuance to the other side of the debate. Thanks for the comment o7
---
Its true, on the edgelord scale we are only like 5/7. Still a solid choice for a newbro though ha.
---
What is the point of holding territory if you aren't able to defend it?
---
lol but shouldn't there be a vexor bpc in there?
---
Will I got a diploma for reading your essay and write a composition about it?
---
&gt;crying for CCP to intervene to manage the market.
---
i guess the difference is that EVE is an artificial system by definition. An economist in this context is about designing the systems correctly rather than managing them appropriately.

No, but if I ever see you in person I'll buy you a waffle cone! XD

I can't speak for all of eve, but if I'm dropping on someone I'm there because I want a frag and then I want to escape with *hopefully* every ship that came on the drop
---
It's a question. You don't have to answer
---
Been saying it for years, put a timer on cloaks. 
---
Waking up, logging in and going afk for 23 hours is unattended gameplay.. don’t we all bitch and moan about botters and their unattended gameplay?
---
Abyssal Deadspace can be 1 billion per hour. That's in hisec.
---
Having scouts **mitigates** risk for the person who owns said scout. You need to remember the people dropping on you are risking their tackle/cyno/whatever they drop for a chance to kill your ship and hopefully not die to YOUR friends
---
Agreed. Although after some of the other comments there may be a less drastic solution that has less chance to have side effects. 
---
Hell maybe you just get automatically safe logged if you don't enter any input for an hour or something.
---
That is in itself a shitpost, should I have used the normie "/s". Reddit....

After the marauder rebalance a few years ago it was not uncommon to see NOS's on ones fit for soloing C4 &amp; C5 WH's.

There's nothing that states it is for the number of accounts per logged in player, it says accounts per player. That could mean every account ever created, which seems like it would more accurate to the presented data. Not to mention I doubt they were able to capture the data per logged in account as it would be much easier to simply apply it to all accounts.

The same sales on builder sites also lead to sales on components.

Cloaky camping is a symptom of Eve 2k19. With intelbots, botting bots and intelchannels, there's only so much you can do to actually kill crabs. You either scout them with a blue toon, or you cloaky camp. If you want the awareness based hunting of old days back you are shit outta luck sadly
---
It's more expensive after considering platinum insurance for other battleships, but still fairly cheap
---
Two gpus, two ssds (at least one of which, the Evo, I can price for you at ~250 or so if you bought it right as it came out), three HDDs, meme HIGH CLOCKZ RAM, a full set of computer mice apparently...
---
Yes, cool, so drop it down to 1 SSD for boot and your favorite games, one 970, and you'd still have a computer that handles modern games with better graphical fidelity and framerate than consoles for maybe... 1200 at the time? Well done.
---
don't need the CPUs if you go armor btw
---
Actually, I have to take it back. I did have an error on a build once.
---
It wouldn't boot.
---
However, having built it myself and understanding what I was looking at, I was able to swap the two sticks of RAM i had from channels 2 and 4 to 1 and 3, rather than panic, shrug my shoulders, and return it for repair.
---
That's a good point. Perhaps a symptom of much larger issues, and a targeted fix would be sticking a bandade on a leaking dam.
---
Never use anything except the “tight” formation (furthest left).
---
For a pattern like the one shown, center the probe cluster at the very center and make the radius one tick larger than the edge of the dotted red ring.
---
If nothing happens, widen your radius again until the pattern shifts.
---
Your scan strength is also below the required amount to scan down Level III signatures.  So if you’re in a wormhole or nullsec, that may be a contributing factor.  For reference, at 90 scan strength you can scan down most signatures so shoot for that number eventually.
---
Does this have audio? i Wana hear what the commentator
---
F1 warrior says get gud lol
---
I could definitely see that, since Sleepers love to lay the neuts on heavy.
---
They have prebuilt options you can pick from and you can modify those with different options available to those builds. You don't have to know anything about PCs to use their configuration tools. It's as easy as ordering from a fast food menu and telling them you want ketchup and mustard on your Big Mac rather than special sauce.
---
I am well aware that i don't stand a snowballs chance in hell against ratter hunters if i'm out ratting. Ideally i would not get dropped on at all, so i don't really even know how to answer your question. There isn't really an in between state where i could counter the people attacking me. So arguing for a preferred degree of counter doesn't make sense.
---
I vaguely remember a Rifter model (considering, going off of the marketing and things like the RAF website is something of a mascot ship) being offered for... Something, years and years ago.
---
Am I having fake memories? Because I could have sworn it was like... A VIP EVEFest package reward or... Something. Something that at the time I said "man I wish I had the money for that".
---
Or maybe I'm just remembering the old models someone else linked itt.
---
&gt; An economist in this context is about designing the systems correctly rather than managing them appropriately
---
An economist at this point *would* be managing systems, not designing anything.
---
Literally look at the title of the post lol
---
Yeah, and that's awesome!
---
Doesn't that make you as risk averse as the ratters you are trying to hunt? You both want to get what you are after without losing any ships.
---
You go on about risk, but you mitigate it at every turn. And you bemoan ratters for trying to mitigate their own risk with standing fleets and by docking up if hostiles come near?
---
Is OP a member of INIT perhaps?
---
Hehe. I don't think I would be as opposed to the low effort, high threat nature of blops camping if I was a member of a large alliance that had enough regularly active members that I'd pretty much always have more than enough backup to counter drop o7
---
This is an RMT tactic.  CCP is likely tracking the pilot that looted the wreck.
---
Scanning is a sort of "minigame" you do using a ship equipped with a probe launcher and scanner probes. They're super cheap (comparatively speaking). Basically, you open up a display of the system map you're in, you launch probes, and you have overlapping spheres that represents each probe's scan area. Once you have a specific site you're trying to get warp coordinates for, you "pinpoint" it by putting your probes into pinpoint formation (just an overlapping box) and, for a really REALLY simple explanation of it, basically try to make it so the site is "seen" by each probe by the octuple overlap in the middle.
---
Once you've "scanned down" a site, you can warp to it. Upon landing, you can find caches upon which you play the hacking minigame (which I won't even try to do justice especially not on my phone), and unlocking them nets you loot that is often worth a decent amount.
---
Here, Eve Uni explains it better:
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Scanning
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Hacking
---
No, there's no cloaking modules that enable you to use modules while cloaked. And since you're asking about making ISK... Trust me, cloaked or not, you are not going to make anywhere near a sizeable amount just randomly mining highsec sites, and no null Bloc will likely ignore you roaming their space to mine the more worthwhile nullsec-only ores.
---
nah, just remove it altogether
---
CCP could outright permanently delete jump fatigue from the game if the largest power blocs were 50 real dudes.
---
There is no balance that can ever happen that will fix this. Deleting Rorquals won't matter, nor will deleting Titans, unless you cap corp and alliance sizes and prevent mass blue lists.
---
you make a new tab
---
I hear the music from the Red Wedding Que up
---
You're running dual 4ks and a 2k for gaming on a single 1080? Are you full potato mode for your graphics settings because a 1080 barely pushes a single 4k anywhere close to playable FPS and decent graphics settings
---
Then have neighbors to fight that are closer instead of blocking out the two regions adjacent to yours for rental empires.
---
Do you know how difficult it is to wage an offensive war in Eve now days? Cloaky camping is one of the few effective tools people have to do it
---
For info check this https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Exploration
---
Then also I suggest you search for a video in YouTube called The rule of 6 
---
To learn more about scanning you can also search for guides about that in YouTube or in-game press f12 &gt; Tutorial videos &gt; Exploration
---
That barely means minimum specs to even be considered a gaming PC
---
I'm not claiming all ratters are risk averse, some are as you see them ratting in frigates and t1 vexors to have less risk of being dropped. The guy whose out in his 2bil snake/6b marauder/16b super is however taking a greater risk of being hunted. You undock be prepared to lose it all.
---
Beause we could always use more Spaceball gifs with subtitles
---
Remember that FCON titan that went afk on a citadel to watch game of thrones and died for it? Good times
---
There won't be with the state the megacoalitions are in.
---
If you want more fighting, scale back the bloc sizes and make their existing territory matter more.
---
ive spent time with shade myself, quite a good dude, hes just a good poker that's all
---
Uh what? Both the attackers and the guy ratting need to take every step to protect themselves from ending up on zkillboard.com. If the droppers or the ratters half ass it, they deserve to die.
---
That's a good point. It's just a shame that one of the few ways to do it is boring for the aggressor and frustrating for the defender. Again, speaking as someone who has been both of those things numerous times. Guess the solution would have to be on a higher systemic level.
---
Thanks for taking the time to comment o7
---
All of them are prebuilts. There's a base model and you can modify certain parts, but it's still a prebuilt. Truly custom you can change every part to anything you want. Prebuilts have a limited selection.
---
Tying local to soverignty structures would hurt the smaller groups more than it would hurt larger ones. I guarantee a change like that would come as something similar to an ESS and myself and any other people roaming random swathes of space would kill them as often as criminals and suspects die in high sec.
---
In additional points, nullsec has been hit harder with nerfs recently than any other sec. Two nerfs to anom respawn time and nerfs to Rorquals (which aren't enough) as well as essentially giving carriers a modified siege module have made income generation via activities reliant on local intelligence much more dangerous at the most optimized levels. And this is showing in the recent MER.
---
This is coming from someone who doesn't mine or rat but instead spends a large amount of time hunting the very same targets as you and experiences the same frustration. Before you think I'm just a krab who doesn't want my shell to get any smaller than it already is.
---
It's fine for people that want to pick a PC and don't know a lot about them. My comment was to the person that was asking for advice about his build when the Op clearly didn't build it and from later comments in this thread, probably isn't well versed enough to give the advice about building one.
---
If you don't stand a chance then your option is to discourage them from killing you by keeping it cheap (the penalty being your dank ticks go down). Boost your own awareness by monitoring their killboards, have eyes where they drop from if they become lazy. If your friends cant/wont help you, get new ones. Watch intel like a hawk and give solid intel yourself to contribute. If your space is overrun with hunters to a point you become discontent move.
---
If dreddit is not your thing join a any other big Corp a good one for new players is Eve uni. Don't play on your own you will get bored and quit. Don't and I really mean don't join a small 10 man hisec Corp. It will ruin the game for you because you will still be playing on your own
---
Damn Vayio, what'd you do to piss off Snuff so badly they come to reddit to post kms of your cheapfits?
---
This. Fuck. If you aren't actively at your keyboard for 5 minutes, you are considered AFK. Could even have a notice to friends. And after 20 minutes you're back on a login screen.
---
Only problem is that would require sufficient change in coding of the login screen which is something CCP has deemed not worth the effort if I've read previous posts correctly.
---
Literally the first thing I thought.
---
I did the math looking at investing in PLEX a few days ago during "Serenity is coming!" hysteria; to break even the price of individual PLEX needed to climb by something like 200k from its at the time... I think 4.09 mil?
---
In other words, a 4.9% increase. In other words... OP is thrilled he is barely breaking even.
---
I think this is best summed up as... "Lol"
---
The F1s are so synchronized
---
Not always. Paypal is just a money transfer system. They will step in if Laws are broken or if their Terms and Services are broken but they are a little hesitant in enforcing 3rd Party EULA's unless they have to because they got stung before when some Korean MMO's EULA (I think it was Ragnarok Online Im not 100% on that though.) was found to be illegal in some countries.
---
Also MMOGA sells legit stuff like game codes in the same way GoG or even Humble Bundle does so they DO have a legal side to them. But they also sell Isk (Not Plex straight out Isk) by the 100's of Billions.
---
Then what mythical currency do you think they used in the NEX store that was a part of the Incarna release good sir??
---
Most of the people i encounter on here think ratters are sub human scum of the earth who deserve to die. Please forgive me for not initially taking you at your word.

You know there's market history view that lets you see numbers of orders, right? You're claiming that within the past 3 days, I can go find at least 20000 units of PLEX moved in a single day with an average (as such an astounding figure of product as you claim to have bought) of at least 5% less than current market value?

could you use faction ammo please
---
In what I remember  the ship doesn't go over 70% resists, say with 2/3 energized membranes or adaptive invuls plus the damage control. So even being omni tank, it doesn't feel good with that percentage of resists. I prefer to have a hole which is usually on 60% or 55 as max but the rest of resistances reaching 80% or more.
---
Okay kinda. 
---
So like... people take shits for longer than 5 minutes it’s gotta be longer than that fam haha. 
---
Also I think a retriever takes about 30minutes to fillup. So 30 would be the absolute minimum. I was thinking 1-2hrs. Cause logging onto eve takes at least 2 hrs.
---
211 must be the absolute maximum All implants + Skills.
---
I mean yeah, he's pretty fucking awful, if you're not a billionaire.

How does a plated, multi-neut fitted VNI let an Atron do 4k damage to him? Did he just not turn on his weapons and died on station in the hopes of deaggroing?

I know everything there is to know about building PCs, and I still paid one to be built for me.  It sounds like you know how to build a PC, and consider it some great science that you have mastered. ;-)

CyberpowerPC is basically the same, and I had every single part chosen by myself, including what fans, what case, what thermal compound to use.  You sound like an expert, have you ever ordered a PC from iBuyPower, or are you just mouthing off?
---
I was just picking at your word choice. Never said you were wrong..... Chill out dude
---
You didn't make 4 billion profit.
---
With broker's fees and taxes, even with perfect skills, you made 2.3% profit at the VERY BEST set of circumstances (someone put up a sell order you bought immediately for the low water mark of 4,040,585 for 20000 PLEX... so someone apparently converted *700 dollars* to PLEX and willfully sold it at the lowest price that day; and you fill the current best contenders for buy order up today, at 4,214,000 per unit, two orders for a bit over 10k each; and oh yeah, you have perfect Trade skills and perfect Cal Navy relations, still a hard limit of 1% sales tax with Accounting V).
---
You did not make 4 billion profit. You made, at the VERY BEST and assuming a ridiculous set of perfect circumstances, 1,840,000,000. Even assuming everything else about your story was a fairy tale come true for you where you neither paid broker's fees on buy nor sell.
---
If either is the case, and assuming you have perfect CN relations and perfect Broker Relations skill, that's 2% (hard capped) lost on either side. I'm gonna assume the buy order is bullshit, so that's 2% loss. So now you made 0.3% profit... or 240,000,000 ISK.
---
Wowie zowie, big numbers. An hour doing T4 abyssals with 0 risk to my ship and I make that, without having to hope the market climbs.
---
I don't add active characters to my stories, sorry.
---
not... not everyone hates the praxis
---
The praxis has a few notable downsides which stunt its popularity, but overall the main thing holding the praxis back is that T1 battleships are basically the worst class of ship in eve online, and within T1 battleships, the Praxis is average at best
---
Downsides
---
\- Ungodly slow base speed
---
\- It has marginal fitting, which means you have to give up some of those low slots to make truly great fits
---
\- It's damage bonuses are split between drones and its main weapon system... this is good for ratting but marginal for most other uses
---
\- It has no insurance, which means that it's one of the more expensive T1 battleships to fly
---
The Praxis has a really solid niche role as a C3 wormhole ratter. Two modestly fit rapid heavy praxis can buzzsaw through C3 sites and make good bank for little risked.
---
It's also a vaguely decent solo PVP battleship, however solo PVP in a battleship is mostly a fantasy

What about instead of an actual structure that has to be anchored in system, make it an IHUB upgrade?

Mmmmm yup thats right.

the more chiner bots we see over time I think this will become a more reasonable option to the majority of the player base.

if they are logged in, they are active.

Not entirely true, for example on one of my fleets we got bombed warping to a gate so I reconsidered, and next gate warped us to a celestial near and baited the bombers. Now this being said, I didn't stop and think I just kept moving and changed plans, which is kind of what you are getting at I think.

The old allignment chart makes you guys look like saints

I still haven't sold, and the numbers are still rising. Brokers fees are 0 isk, why would i sell in jita when there's 0% raitarus in perimeter?

No activity should be AFKable or all activities should be. Dramatic extremes!

Belt ratting for faction drops
---
I once took a break from nullsec by living in the highsec pocket around the lowsec area of The Forge, of around 4 days. Did anomalies for the escalations and expeditions, along with the ghost sites. From DEDs you can get from 20m to 300m depending on your luck, say B or C- type modules with  high demand like shield boosters, faction ewar mods, and faction ship bpcs. From ghost sites you can get at least 30m to 60 if you're fast enough to grab these cogs needed for implant production. 
---
I also remember now doing unrated sites, which are pretty fast to run, and also drop faction mods. 
---
In belt ratting you can do it in a ceptor or anything fast, and the faction destroyers or frigs (I've encountered destroyers only) drop faction mods and even implants that can reach up to 200m isk in price.
---
From that break I got around 700m, with 5-10 hours of work as much (mainly in moving around systems, running anomalies and scanning) in total. I am pretty sure that dedicating a whole day to a big highsec area I'd be getting that and more, but I did that break for a reason and was to avoid burning out with my regular activities. All I needed was a Gila and an Astero. If there are people interested in this, you can use a T1 explorer and T1 battlecruisers.
---
The enviroment is quite different from nullsec, there are more people looking for the same stuff, and the friendly music makes the journey pretty enjoyable.
---
Sure.  
---
  
---
When they delete local.
---
Then we basically have the same system that we do now where impenetrable space is unchanged. Time wasted IMO.
---
Paranoia... must be the drugs.
---
Problem is I hate pve badly so it’s rare for me to get into situations like that. When I used to do pve in low, I always used pvp fits tho
---
Funny how this shows up as soon as people start screeching about bits again
---
Cool, just don't make the mistake of putting a Rey, er, Mary Sue in there and you're golden.
---
Ok seriously fuck you and that shitty ass battle report generator. Also fuck darkness
---
Looks like an alpha fit, is it?
---
You are not forced to create an alt from day one, been playing since 2012 and waited till 2016-2017 to have an alt. (made my life harder but was def doable)
---
Hi manny
---
They dont drink as much chocolate milk as you do
---
&gt;(in case you didnt know, the praxis is given to every player on their 15th birthday)
---
I think they were given out when EVE turned 15.
---
Been a lot of that in the comments. Can't say I disagree.
---
If they're logged in, and asleep in their bed, that hardly counts imo lol

Nice flair bait

\^\^ This - he sounds more desperate and/or stupid than anything else.
---
I think Markee Dragon still sells the model Rifters he took out of the special edition boxes or whatever they were. He couldn't sell the boxes so he took out the Rifters and sells them, or at least he used to.
---
Not sure why you're getting all this heat (-6 atm) - to each their own, and you've carved a niche in LS. Good on you!
---
No male prostitutes??
---
Pretty much the only logical solution. But it wont be that easy. FRT has its own ridiculous supercap fleet, everyone and their dog gonna jump on TEST + Goons in that case. Also FRT has industrial capacity to produce 100500 ships up to cruiser size in a week and supply them to neuts/allies in a freeport structure near the place of action so the whole server node crashes and burns in  pointless 8-10 hour TDI brawl
---
Theres alot of people who are on the "fuck snuff" bandwagon. As long as they hate the group and not the individuals its whatever. I left nullsec after almost a year there, realised it just wasn't my thing. I prefer low sec, it's where my friends are.
---
The VNI was in the room with rats, a few km off the beacon. I just went at him, weapons hot. By the time he had recalled his drones and had targeted me he was already in structure... I survived with 400 points of structure left ;)
---
I had no business surviving any of these engagements tbh. But I figured they were bad, so went at it anyway. Plus it's an Atron, who cares ;) and if it works out you get to write a fun AAR ;)
---
Excellent video with a really interesting fit!
---
The groups I know that ran null incursions would always pad the fleet numbers with new players and alts to get the maximum possible payout from each site. If you are with the right group, you could do this in a shuttle semi-afk as a couple month old player. If I remember correctly, the maximum number in null HQ fleet is 50, so with 10-20 capitals / supers + 10 support it still leaves a lot of space for leeches to just collect the free ISK.
---
well, i once won this one from Markee, and i'm willing to sell

No you. Your not really in SOE. Coward.

This keeps getting more incorrect by the reply.

Sometimes the directors like to leave frat blue after the battle... It makes standing fleet farm more interesting when everyone in PH inc is dogpiling some frat cruisers while BLS is shouting awox... Or vis versa.
---
Another retard shouting Gila as hard as he can.
---
Gila have less tank, way less DPS and cost three times the Praxis. It won’t complete any shit faster, it’ll die. Quickly.
---
And if you lose a Praxis, you’ll have less troubles paying it back than a fully fit Gila.
---
Well, yeah, they keep our southern regions from touching the goons southern regions.

For all the hate you get, you mostly killed riff raff anyway. The number of VNI farmers in delve dropped while you guys were camping, and all the supers you killed were more or less Chinese shit fits or bots.

It's down to the skills of the rorq pilot, max skills means 6 bombs, the implant means 7

You really don't understand the suggestion here though. 
---
It is not meant to make it easier for the defender to dispatch and fight, it gives the inferior force chance to cause damage to other than the main response force.
---
You would be able to defend it just fine. You simply need to read what is actually written in the suggestion.
---
Thanks for the feedback!

I think the gif is about my excavator booshing ops with which I stole over 1.5 trillion so far. It's not much for Delve overall but decent money for one person.

Confirmed. I knew a functional meth head some years ago. She was very secretive about her use. Used mutiple times daily, I knew as her otherwise secluded porch was visable from my balcony. She was a bank teller when we met. By the time I moved she was the controller at a major bank local branch. All while high af. Definitely the exception tho.

there is literally no good reason to have local in the game

all it does is hurt the ecosystem

if you ALWAYS know when a hostile is nearby, the risk associated with activities approaches zero, especially in tyool 2019 when local can be screenread by programs which automatically tell you when a hostile enters system and autofocuses the window that needs to warp off

My best tip: Turn the client to maximum and let it be. There is no reasonable method to get more out of it.

---
you know that there is basically no single cap fleet that regularly takes the gates? Do you know how much fuel a cap needs to jump through a gate? It would have to be refueled every time a fleet of caps go through. 
---
Also they could have let super be able to take it, that would have been more fun actually. 3 supers through, refuel that thing again
---
Time to rename some public beacons to Got spoilers 😂
---
What hate tho?
---
Is there a site or calculator that shows how much Skill Points every skill level is worth? When I hover over a skill it does say the total amount for all 5 levels but how do I know how much lvl1, 2, 3.. etc is worth on it's own? Thanks!
---
You seem like the kind of person who deals with disappointment well, so this will not be too bad a week for you.
---
This is a different fleet. I told them to approach.
---
Praxis is the best ratting ship for alpha clones, since all of its damage bonuses are role bonuses.  While alphas can fly VNIs and rattlesnakes, they can't max the cruiser or battleship skills that boost their effectiveness.  Also, since heavy drones are technically a large weapon system, and heavy missiles, even rapid heavies, are technically a medium weapon system, alphas can use T2 rapid heavy launchers but not T2 heavy drones. All of this means that an alpha Praxis outperforms an alpha VNI by a larger margin than an omega rattle outperforms an omega VNI, for a fraction of the cost difference.

Here's me thinking the imgur link was to a picture of the license plate...

We are looking into it atm. I had some really quality printed ships in my hands recently but no promises when this is happening.
---
More like they licensed eve to a company not that they were really a supplier as triforce distribute themselves. Triforce bunch of crooks though and there probably isn't enough money to be made selling these, at least worth for the effort CCP would have to put into them.
---
The "how I" part just tells everyone that you are stupid.
---
Its 2019, it should be "How my bots".
---
Yeah man I felt exactly the same way when I played Eve - it felt like a completely different reality almost, with its own rules and laws and culture. I haven't played for five years (jesus it's been a while), but when I did I loved it. It's a shame it's been game-ified so much (from what I can tell). Always felt to me like CCP had created something special.
---
Why do people keep trying to make this guy relevant?
---
If you haven’t sold then you haven’t made a profit.
---
Yes. The filters that the d-scan uses are the exact same as the "tab presets" that your overview uses. So in order to make a d-scan filter, you have to make a new tab preset in your overview. You don't need to actually use that preset on your overview.

Quite sure incursion logi rats "run out of cap" and the ability to rep other rats after a while...
---
I think I used interdiction maneuvers exclusively. Part of what makes this ship work especially against smaller stuff is the surprising web range and strength. You graze an Interceptor with that and it's basically toast. 
---
I don't think rapid deployment is useful here. Against several targets you're bound to get swarmed anyway and against one or two your webs should suffice to keep them off you and/or murder them real fast.
---
/r/thathappened
---
You're definitely right. In an ideal world all the different use cases would be considered equally, but often enough the discussion begins and ends at fleet level. Which is a shame - I think it's important to have ships that excel at PvE or camping, for example. 
---
(The Navy Drake is a damn good small gang skirmish platform btw)

Never mix cannons.

It's a fine line to walk when you're looking for hotdroppers specifically...

At least two of the Prot pilots in this video were seen flying Polarized Navy Drakes afterwards, so I've got that going for me!

i thought i was on one of my leftist subs and got really confused.

Where did you get the idea that isk wil inflate 2 times?
---
You are telling me in one year supers and titans will be back to their old prices because inflation? I call bs
---
Wow. So much incorrect information in one post.
---
Still have Plex (now 500) bought back in the day for 375mil. so what!
---
Maybe instead of a timer, give it a charge (like ammo). I could see a problem with a set timer where the person gets decloaked at a very bad moment cuz the timer ran out. If the pilot is in a cloaky fleet this could lead to a whole feel being decloaked #awkward. 
---
Maybe add a charge to the cloaking device would work. Like call it ''Naughty plasma'' or so. You could add a % of usuage on each  level of cloaking device and it would lead to players having to decide how much charges they could take with them. This would also force cloaky campers to move once in a while to get new charges and there for allow pilots to setup traps etc.

For pve , especially wormhole pve, im not entirely sure . But i think raven would be better or even domi. Rattle and mach are best btw except they

---
For pvp, no one says praxis is shit. It is a beast with incredible amount of cargo space. Very decent brawling ship except for its speed and price. Yeah, u said praxis is cheaper than other t1 bs. But not in pvp, u will die someday and u wont get dank insurance unlike other bs. Which is about &gt;100mil i believe.
---
Yes, most of the stuff sold there  is at best against eula of the respective game (earned by bottling/hijacking accounts/etc. ) but also lots of stolen credit card stuff.
---
&gt; The fans of unlimited reach for huge nullsec entities will of course downvote me and cling to their sand castles 
---
No, you got my upvote, because you are completely right. There is no real reason why the "new" jumpgates have no fatigue at all.  
---
I understand, that the experience is more compliant with the use of other stargates, but that's an odd reason if you have to throw sov warfare balance under the bus for that.  
---
Especially with the new (and very low) jump fatigue we currently have, I don't see a reason to keep fatigue from these gates. As OP suggests, it could be just a small percentage of bridge-fatigue. But it should still have a small limiting effect.
---
They didn't. He left to become the dean of akureyri university.
---
Wrong. He was a fantastic person to help observe what was going on in the game, and explain the theory behind it, and how to best address it.
---
Source: Worked with him at CCP.
---
He was there to study it, and help come up with methods to ensure the economy was healthy.
---
When the "carbon" creator came out back in the day you had to create a new character. I think this predates you a little bit.
---
The sov null structures you propose would make null even safer than it is now, effectively giving local only to the defenders. 
---
Either remove local or don't. Tying it to a structure only makes that structure mandatory for every system, and knowing CCP it'll be anchorable on a Keepstar grid and take 30 minutes to ref.
---
This game dying 16 years, probably overhearing invul.
---
Mmoga keys are not really legit. They're mostly bought in other countries where they're cheaper. Which is most of the time against the eula of where ever you redeem it. So similar to rmt in eve which isn't illegal, only against eula. Region restrictions are just often not enforced.
---
Nows a pretty good time to start, over the last few years I've had a number of new players join my corps and been excited about all there is to do and explore. Try to find a player corp asap to join and help guide you through.
---
From the chat i had with a dev, the rats assume they can't break your tank (because you've been on grid for a while) and switch target to try and get a kill
---
Possibly, Started playing mid 2009
---
CCP hates money, so there isn't one.
---
Yes, unless it's a big strategic fight, there is no reason to burden the members with slow travelling baltecs for a couple of ours only to get blue balled anyways. \^\^  
---
Also: We use SIGs &amp; Squads to make up for that situation of long travelling. Space Violence is usually right in the middle of the action ;)
---
Why are people using this terrible BR tool
---
Burn it with holy flaaaame!
---
Yea, they have a can in our hole, we have it BMd but leave it alone.
---
&gt;it’ll die. Quickly.
---
Not in a C3 it won't. Even with an affordable fit a Gila can easily run C3 sites.
---
I can't tell you if it's faster or slower, but having more tank is not really a factor in PVE. There is only enough tank and not enough tank.
---
It is never too late to play the game. Just decide what you want out of it.
---
I got into the game same year as you in 2010. The first character I made in that year is my main and that character now have 120 mil SP and there are still plenty of skills to train.
---
And this game is still a hive of scum and villainy, same as 2010.
---
I think the difference between us, is that I go in knowing that I am diving into a brutal universe. And I am not talking about the game mechanic, but the players culture.
---
Especially Jita is the equivalent of Mos Eisley from Star Wars. You either quit or become a salty bitter leftover in-game and in real life. If CCP made the first person walk in station. Jita should have its own slum and I am sure real life RMT gangster would infest the station as well.
---
I have experienced instances of being scammed and treat it as a cheap life lesson. Nothing like the heart stopping sensation of being ambushed or the sensation after being scammed to teach you not becoming scammed for real life money in the real world.
---
You can learn and experienced the emotional impact of what tactics real life scammer used in Eve and applied it to protect yourself from IRL scam. Looking at it that way, it’s a cheap price to pay for a lesson.
---
You can learn patience by not being baited and provoked in-game chat. It’s a valuable skill in the workplace believe me.
---
The Russians, Chinese, Americans, Europeans, Asians have their own presence and allegiance in the game. So you could be exposed to international culture as well. Especially 10,000 Chinese players are now migrating from serenity, so there will be a big shakeup to the status quo in the future.
---
I recommend you get subscribed and exchanged some plex for isk though rather than grinding in the game. Not too much plex though, just to get by. There will definitely be some hyper inflation in the future due to the Chinese players but how bad it is nobody would know.
---
Please don't say it's cheap. Because that's only true if you don't loose it in the first 3 months. 
---
It has no insurance value. 
---
It's also slow as fuck. And it has awefull CPU. Not really allowing many interesting fits. 
---
It doesn't do as well as most other battleships. And it's only role might be wormhole c3 ratting because of its uniformed resistance.
---
i mean the best is over but you can easily still get a year out of it
---
That's ok though, the most popular fits hull tank it anyway. gets stupid high buffer with bulkheads and two damage mods. 
---
And 6 utility mid slots to use for anything you want.
---
It's not a great ship, but it's ok.
---
You can make shitloads if you actually care about PI, i hate it so i'm not doing that shit more than a few minutes every werk

---
Level V: 256,000
---
This is true of skills with a 1x modifier. For skills with a higher modifier, just multiply each stage by the modifier (2x,  3x, etc)
---
Better than most games which would just display a "game over" screen with an exposion in the background once you touch a structure at a decent speed.
---
Because it works, unlike all the other BR tools

Plz spread the word, Just in Case This Spoiler Campaign is for real !

None of those things are correct, you'll be glad to know.

Botting systems are less crowded. You can find them by checking numbers of NPCs killed. They don't have to be high, in fact they will be low as VNIs don't kill fast but NPC kill graph will be flat. 
---
 [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/AA-GWF](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/AA-GWF)  Take a closer look at this system. It's a botting system. NPC kill graph is flat. You don't even need to travel ther to see it but if you do youll find 2-3 VNIs working there all day long. Their owners are 2-3 month old characters.
---
Short answer: yes
---
Long answer: it depends on what you mean.
---
The center of a group of systems can mean a few different things. It can mean:
---
* The system from which the max/average number of stargate jumps to any other system in the group is the lowest
---
* The system most closely located to the average location of all systems in terms of their placement in 3D space
---
* The system that requires the least fuel/cynos to jump to any other system in the group for a given shiptype (not applicable for hs)
---
Moreover by Amarr space, are you referring also to include NPC lowsec? Or NPC null? Do you mean all Amarr sov constellations or do you just mean like, Tash-Murkon + Domain?
---
In this case for most purposes the best answer for "center," for most practical applications that would need such a thing, usually just turns out to be "just use the Amarr trade hub."
---
I'd look on dotlan and see if they have a tool that answers your question for whatever you're trying to do.

Do not skip tutorials, if you are into PVP go do that early and get your feet wet. Know that there is a difference between PVP and fleet PVP. In a fleet you will just be pressing F1, going out hunting solo is tons of fun. 
---
Try out all kinds of things in the game before deciding to "join PH or Karmafleet(these are big recruiters for nullsec space ) Find your own niche.

So did the most static 2 years, and they were the most recent of the no fatigue era.

GIVE A BLOODY LICENSE TO KISAKI STUDIOS YOU DUMB FUCKS!!!!
---
I disagree with all the below answers in a key aspect: where to start.
---
Do not start off the bat by doing Caldari Navy missions. Instead, go to Arnon XII and run the Sisters of EVE epic arc. It's designed for new players and a great intro to missions with a bit of storyline. The last boss is also decently difficult in a cheap frigate, and is a common place to ask for help--there are often bored veteran players in the area who specifically hang out in the area waiting to be asked for help with that boss in local chat, and a good one will coach you through some basic mechanics.
---
The reason you do this, besides the educational value, is that it is very easy and gives a huge standing boost to a \*\*faction of your choice.\*\* If you're going to do Caldari Navy missions like everyone else to lower your fees if you ever decide to peddle wares in the Jita trade hub, that means you can get a free bump-up with Caldari. I think this might even let you fast-forward to level 2 missions.
---
The arc is also repeatable every 6 months, and will continue to give the standing boost, which you can apply to the same or different faction at your discretion.
---
Also if you need help fitting your ship, head over to /r/fittings and make a post starting with \[R\] to indicate it's a request.
---
overpowered? not really. i use a travel crow to get from fountain to querious and vice versa all the time and it still needs some 15 minutes even with JBs. and this shit is 1.78 align time and 10AU . Imagine moving a typhoon or anything with slow speed.
---
As a non native i found ur accent sexy
---
Also the way u speak, i feel you are murmuring unimportant part followed by very sophisticated spoken sentence. Very sexy (im not gay btw)
---
Where are u from?
---
&gt; Guess I'll go back to mining and relax for a bit.
---
*cackling laughter* I lost Hulk #4 because it was caught in the geometry of the asteroids when I had a clear field of vision to the celestial. It would not align, it would not move out of the belt and then I got fragged.
---
That's probably because a lot of those people like having low sec be good for small gang/solo stuff or small alliances. When snuff is so bored they are treating Black Rise like it's sov null and dropping 5 caps on every t1 cruiser they see.... it garners a lot of salt. Which to be fair, may be the point for some snuffed members. That leads to a lot of us just not engaging anything with a snuff tag or even the random "most likely a snuffed cynos." It also limits the small fleet/gang engagements that people are willing to get tied down in/brawl with due to the inevitable snuffed cap drop shortly to follow, at least when you guys are active in the region. 
---
To each their own playstyle.... but it shouldn't be surprising that a lot of people don't like having their "range of available content" minimized because you are maximizing yours. 
---
BUT..... It's part of the game and we all just have to adapt to the environment around us. It would however be nice if there was a group that could go toe to toe with you guys and spice things up/make life a little riskier for you.
---
Well that was a lot more than I intended to type.... oh well...
---
The remove local argument ignores the fact that cynos exist. Cynos completely change mechanics versus wormhole space. Maybe if cynos were mass limited (based on the type of ship lighting the cyno) and there was a delay on lighting a cyno after making a cyno jump yourself, then removing local would be a suitable solution.
---
Wormholes also have other mechanics that mitigate lack of local. Critting all statics, rolling all K162s and hiding all existing sigs from probe scanner basically means you are ratting in your own little island.
---
Don't get me wrong, no local and current mechanics would suit my play style down to the ground, it would make hunting so easy - but I do not think it would be balanced.
---
The fact of the matter is, in WH space, a cloaked ship is a cloaked ship. In nullsec/lowsec a cloaked ship (and single entry in local) could be just a single ship, or it could be 100 titans.
---
I second this. Also... the above idea that Shade just wants content and to be relevant. He ain't exactly the most subtle person in the world.
---
Yes. They can be moved to another (smaller) citadel or NPC station.
---
l still think he is hired by goon higher ups just to keep the line members on there toes
---
Speaking isn't my strongest suite, let's keep it at that. :D
---
&gt;The remove local argument ignores the fact that cynos exist.

And yet there could be cloaked people in your hole waiting for you, and you'd never know. This is what eve needs, not instant 100% perfect intel 24/7.
---

imagine unironically thinking the game is balanced when 99% of non cap people dock up when neuts enter local. the only people that die are literal afks or newbies. this is a trash system which is far more broken than the alternative of *gasp* people needing to work together.

Yeah... kinda what happens when you consolidate most cap pilots in a region into one organization. Totally a fair point tho. #gottagetthatkm

It was long ago but if I remember correctly they would bring people in the TeamSpeak chat and make them do progressively more demeaning things for money, only to scam them at the end.

Basically it was taking the EVE scam into quite a dark place, as it's only one step away from blackmailing people in RL.

ahh if you do come back to delve make sure you check local some times because lm having a long distance relationship with one of your campers and it can get very heated, plus we have 2 kids and a third on the way ;)

you see not that hard, just need 30 dread, even a medium scale alliance could have fun and farm goons under their own super umbrella because we are way to easy to kill

---
Some players understand or explain better then most. While moving capital fleets trough ansiblex is not a viable thing, moving hundred of subcaps back an fourth as many times as you want is still a horrible idea. It allowes big alliances to hold and control vast areas of space. Nc. Can defend drone region and run fleets from tribute to the spire in 15 min. Big alliances can get easily involved in other alliance conflict and localized conflict is gone. Small or medium alliances have no chance in creating conflict on their own as big alliance can travel half the map with 200 munnins in 15 min. Add citadels to this and its a recipe for disaster. I for one am in favor of fatigue. I posted a image of eve sov map pre and post fatigue in 2016. Its incredible how the map changed and how many conflict were then.

How many mins did the titan 'survive' upon dreads on field?

He decided to fit only one shield booster and paid the price

Fuck off with your EDT BS, use Eve time or gtfo

Total. Shut. Down.

I wish there was a permasticky that asked the question "IS IT TOO LATE TO PLAY EVE ONLINE?" and there was a single answer "No." and the thread was locked.
---
/u/jibrish make it so pls
---
Can the praxis be built or is it only those free ships?
---
The Dagan mission? yes and no. If you did the epic arc right after the carrer agents you'd likely not have the skills or the ships to break him but with a proper fit dessie or frigate from the free modules you could tank him. So you basically had to ask a friend or someone in local to come help.
---
I'm not sure if that is still the case. Last time I did the soe arc was 5 years ago.
---
Ignore the naysayers. Nice job, bro!
---
A had a erotic fanfic post ready for this :'(
---
About 1.5 minute and my (7 dreads) dps was barely kicking in due to multiboxing.
---
&gt;it doesn't.

It does.
---
&gt; why is it unsuitable? 
---
For the reasons I stated.
---
&gt;And yet there could be cloaked people in your hole waiting for you, and you'd never know. This is what eve needs, not instant 100% perfect intel 24/7

Yes. A limited number. Based on a concerted effort.

---
This would be fixed by balancing other parts of the mechanics to make removing local a balanced change. People dock up at the moment because it is not feasible for smaller groups to have a standing defence fleet up when 99% of the time neuts in local are afk - but there is no way of knowing. I 100% support people working together, pvpers and pveers, but at the moment that would mean pvpers sitting in a standing fleet for hours on end while the single dude camping a whole region with his skill farmed alts goes to work.
---
&gt; you have a poor grasp of nullsec 
---
I was highlighting extremes, but it doesn't negate my point.
---
Lol I wanna see more, nice cut straight in the middle of the song at the end haha
---
Only TNT so who cares?
---
wat?
---
It had to be TNT
---
I like my tripple rep RHML Praxis a whole lot. With a single CPU rig you can Dual Prop it and have a absurd amount of utility on top. It is a good fun and cheap ship to throw at a small gang or something like that but thats it. And honestly that is simply due to RHML being rly good in such a scenario and the slotlayout it has. Pirate BS will outperform it T1 BS wont IMHO as they don't have the utility. 
---
I think people hate on it just due to the fact that BS in smallgang arent rly a thing anymore and besides that it does not rly have a use. If you want to make money you can invest a bit more and get a Rattle if you want fleetBS any T1 BS will outperform it due to a lot of the DPS being in the drones of the praxis and you can slap buffer on any BS anyway. Also it is slow. (Super-)carriers are litteraly faster than the Praxis if you armor tank it.
---
Nah, i did not mean Dagan. He is quite easy when you don't let him neut you. If you upgrade to cruiser before his fight, you should have no problems killing him solo as alpha, i did him in Moa as a fresh character. 
---
What i meant is a security mission, i think lvl2 or 3, where you are sent to explore some tower and you have to get very close to it. As soon as you get close, quite big force (for that level) of rats warps in and if you panick and just hit the jump, you often do get stuck at a rockbase of the tower and rats will have a field day with you.
---
No, that doesnt ring a bell...
---
Maybe you can help RMT him a new one? Since goons allow you do it and ban everyone else.
---
But super umbrellas are impenetrable!
---
This man deserve to die if he rats in titan without his own fax in stand by.
---
Well, good catch.
---
Because why would you not want a SP farm toon ?
---
1. Cloak is not a counter but a simple tool. As soon as a tool in a game becomes hard to counter it is considered overpowered.
---
2. False. Being able to gather intel in a system at any given time without any method to stop it (yes, you can technically try to prevent the camper entering system, i give you that, also good luck on this) can cripple an operation. You can pull the bot card all day every day but let's face it: most of the cloaky campers are not some sort of anti-bot knights.
---
3. See point 2 and think again. A cloaky camper can gather intel at any given time. It is representing a constant threat for the people in system without any way to elliminate this threat. You can put in effort to avoid ship losses if you live in the camped system or avoid the system during fleet movements but man... You really think these efforts are in balance with your effort to log in and press a cloak button?
---
4. As long as you are in system i will assume that you are either gathering intel or ready to light a cyno any time.
---
And so far we talked about a single camper. Do you really think that it is fair that a single person can monitor a whole region (if he has the resources), for as long as he wants from downtime to downtime without means to counter it?
---
Idiots dying in idiotic ways never undermined arguments for opness of umbrellas
---
God damn, you posted this before our rag-tag response fleet even showed up.   
---
AAR from Goon perspective
---
Avabro types in fleet,

---
&gt;\[09:01:25\] Altair Vega Itovuo &gt; ihib on  
---
&gt;\[09:02:38\] Altair Vega Itovuo &gt; fuck
---
Comms are dead, fleet below average size. Are you shocked?  
---
Ask the avabro if he has a cyno, or any hope at survival besides that shiny cap relay.   
---
I'll let you take a guess at the answer i got.
---
I make the call on mumble,
---
&gt; *fuck it X up what we got*
---
I'm met with a surprising 12 x's of random shit with no rhyme or reason, no hope of survival if the dreads actually fight back. With that knowledge in mind, the decision is made. Lets go see what we can grab. 
---
The rest is history, I can only assume that titan is, #alreadyreplaced
---
13m/20 minutes with decent skills. Let's say 10. That's 700 mil a day, 19b a month after plexes, let's make a very conservative estimate of 10b net/month/toon, after vni replacement, plex and bot subscription.
---
So closer to a year and a half

Ratting Titan.....

Exactly what I wanted to know. Thank you!

... have lived in null since '11 and never had this problem. but then again I don't like my content spoonfed like most of null does nowadays cause the real player left years ago.
---
Oh I actually read that Aug as Apr on the last kill for some reason
---
this bug was reported by me like two months ago, happening only when you use old map. On shit new map it's working.
---
ccp did yet literally nothing to fixing that
---
idiots who rat in supers without being on comms/fleet/fax on standby/alliance on CTAs/ deserve to die. most probably soonish enough the response fleet won't even come to save this type of autistic (no pun intended to persons suffering from this disease IRL) nerds. the umbrella is for people with their IQ higher than women's average shoe size. (37EU ?)
---
Implying someone uses the new map.
---
Hi thanks for the AAR. We did kill another titan recently at y-2 and people didn't bother to post so I just wanted to make sure this one is.
---
The dreads you killed are mine and got caught due to additional 20 seconds sieging time required for 7-boxing. Would have been nicer to gtfo with all dreads. But hey they are already replaced too.
---
killmail?

&gt; I play cause i like building big toys and then flying logi in fleets

You can take the krab out of null, but you cant take the null out of the krab.
---
It can pretty decently Outdps the wolf in Sharpshooter and has only slightly worse in propulsion and defensive. 
---
It can also overheat for much longer and is much more friendly on the fitting.
---
And doesnt have the stats to utilize artillery?  It has more fitting and an optimal bonus.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76321994/
---
It's similar to that but the mission (regular, non-epic lvl 2 security) was to clear the rats out. They had destroyers and a couple of cruisers separated by a large structure.
---
My plan was to clear out one side, warp out for repairs, then go in again to the other side. Except upon approach, some frigates swarmed out of the structure. Still confident in my thrasher, I continued firing until I downed a cruiser and a destroyer then engaged my warp drive to a random haven.
---
Four seconds passed. My armor depleted. Five. Six. Half of my hull gone. I zoomed in to my ship. To my horror, it was trying to force itself into the structure and flailed like a sperm. I was fucked.
---
Moral of the story: Overconfidence is a swift and decisive killer in this game.
---
oh that one lol
---
Well then, this probably isnt that because you absolutely had to recreate your character. Unless you still have a ? as your portrait.
---
yup, because for kiting speed is the most important stat right after range, and it doesn't have the speed
---
Bots gonna bot.
---
Don't judge it so fast, it might be an expensive pee...
---
2000ms with an overheat of 2800 is plenty fast enough.
---
against what? not against 6000ms ram jags
---
uhg i can't believe people this stupid exist
---
Nobody cares.
---
I have vsync on all clients.  All clients at high to max settings.  The window with focus gets 60fps, the ones without get 30.  It is eminently playable.  The 1080p monitor only has discord/mumble on it.  Works very well.
---
Of course, I consider 60 fps to be fine.  Perhaps you don't and that's ok.
---
Why not suggest CCP broadcast the movie live on the space station? ahhhhh
---
You’re very welcome. Ah yes but Y-2 is not under the umbrella as you so studiously state in your title.      
---
Had those dreads been piloted by anyone else, they would have gotten away seeing how we showed up about 5 minutes after the avabro died. Luckily for us, it was you flying them.
---
Give me one thing that can deal with 6000ms RAMJags.
---
Its definitely not a wolf. 
---
Fuck off with your stupid as fuck example.
---
Oh the svipul cant deal with a shipo no other ship can deal with its shit. 
---
What the fuck you fucking melon.
---
In British units please (4.5).  EU units are for camp dandies wandering around France and Italy in enormous shirts, trying to get laid.
---
Ratting is so soul destroying, I have no clue why people do it unless... he's botting and his bot kind-of broke.
---
Can't think of anything else to say, so you resort to petty insults. I think you'll find you're the thick one friend.
---
&gt; I'm met with a surprising 12 x's of random shit with no rhyme or reason, no hope of survival if the dreads actually fight back. With that knowledge in mind, the decision is made. Lets go see what we can grab.
---
lmao what a dramatic fucking write up for "idiot avatar was inhibed but we cyno'd in after all the caps warped off except for Olmeca the numpty turk"
---
firstly, i don't thik they actually go 6k, i think its closer to 5, secondly, a wolf is one of the only kitey frigates that solo can deal with a ram jag as they go about the same speed  
---
and thirdly, it seems a bit childish to resort to insults this early in a discussion, i am very disappointed in you
---
&gt; Overconfidence is a swift and decisive killer in this game.
---
And also the most frequent killer. :D
---
A RamJag will absolutely out speed a wolf. Not by much but it will.
---
And a wolf wont break a ramjag until it runs out of cap boosters. 
---
You dont want to be insulted then dont make fucking stupid claims.
---
imperial units are no longer a reference from my pov because no imperiums exists atm (only in EVE there is one).
---
Maybe you can help RMT him a new one? Since goons allow you to do it and ban everyone else.
---
It's all downhill from here. RIP goon.
---
i have the fitting of a standard ram jag, and the standard kiting wolf in pyfa right now, and the difference is a mere 60ms that the jag is faster, and considering most kiting pilots fly with at least a 3% speed drug, the wolf is faster
---
so again, your lack of knowledge fails you, and you don't break a ram jag, you fly around it, and you'll be surprised at how many ram jags are actually mentally challenged and die to dumb shit, kinda like you
---
Nice frag :P

Nothing of value was lost.

---
Plus from my experience people often plex accounts 2-4. One or two get paid with money the fun ones get plexed. 
---
So unless you are part of a nullbloc or have another way to generate way above average income you think "I could spent all my gametime ratting to plex my two alts which I cannot use for anything because I have no spare gametime." Or not plex them and when playing on your main is not fun for whatever reason you leave the game altogether
---
i have almost the same setup MSI gaming Pro AC MB, 16gb DDR4, 1050ti SC but with kaby lake i5 and Eve runs just fine on 2 monitors (1x 4K res on 27", 1x1080p res on 24"). I can run 4 accounts on it as long as you don't keep them all docked (for some reason when you are docked GPU goes to 97% and starts to be a bit laggy). Other games work also fine (not with EVERYTHING on super high graphics because 1050ti is not a great GFX card) but this PC was built for Eve only and some other games i play (transport fever and things like that) . For the hardcore stuff i have the PS4.
---
The best part of the devs trying to defend the pricing scheme was when one of them argued on teh forums that we should treat their micro-transaction items like luxury clothes in the real world because not all people are intended to be able to afford them... I've seen eve players rage but that guy took so much hate in the few minutes it took them to lock the thread it should be in the Guinness book of world records.
---
They tempt you with pricing. 
---
From CCP, $20 gets you around 2bil Isk.
---
From these clowns, that same $20 might get you like 10bil ISK (just guessing).

Agreed. But they are the reason that simply deleting local will not fix all the problems.
---
&gt; i posted that the current system is worse than the removal of local, and you ignored it

This is just bitching without any realistic suggestions on how to actually improve the game. I agree that local is shit. But I also believe that other changes would be required in conjunction with removing local.

Also a pretty good bait ship
---
&gt;  its 30-40m cheaper than the other t1 battleships
---
It's pretty much the price what it's worth. For nearly all ships with limited supply the price and the utility are well balanced. Ships who's prices aren't defined by a limited supply are often strangely wrong. See faction ships. VNIs are stronger than their price while most faction battleships are too expensive for their performance.
---
I know a little bit. 
---
I hardly think you know "everything there is to know" about anything. Hardly anyone who says that really does. that really wasn't the point though. Not everyone does know and unfortunately some people think they know more than they really do and  can give incorrect information. Happens all the time on message boards. Why am I at fault for simply cautioning someone about taking advice? You're the one that decided they wanted to make an issue of my comment
---
If I sit in a belt with the Orca, the asteroids in the immediate vicinity go first, just to clear the grid.

The reason to be close to the asteroids is so that the drone flight time is shorter. Over time that adds up over having the drones having to fly out 10+ clicks to the rocks and back.

Sure you can. If it is online for 23 hours, it won't be active.
---
Fairly certain the Marauder will be faster. Wether it's worth the Pricetag is up to you to decide. 
---
I've flown L4s in Golem/Paladin for a VERY long time and was never Ganked. I'd say it's pretty save unless you bling out your Marauder to the max or do missions in very populated areas.
---
Basing your fit around flying vs retards is retarded. 
---
And your Wolf goes 5737m/s?
---
Vily is parading around.
---
do you generally use bastion mode? or only if you need extra tank?
---
I have skimmed through the comments. Most people argueing local meh. I wouldnt mind but prefer local adds more socialised game play. 
---
Another few options. If u have a cyno, cant fit a covert cloak. So have to decloak to chase pray. 
---
Add a timer after decloak before cyno is available. Example. Warp in decloak tackle. U got 3-5 min cool down before u can light a cyno. Will make it more risky to tackle ships, and gives defense fleet a chance to fight. 
---
Add fuel for cloaks. Basically adding a time limit to length of time for cloak. Then defenders can hunt down fuel boats.
---
snuffed and PL? spicy!

Except at any point during that time, it can be active. You dont know if hes gone to bed or just got home from work. 
---
Do you have trouble with critical thinking?
---
Why does fleetcom.shit want to know my location?
---
Have you considered the Rattlesnake? Even with mediocre missile skills it will still run level 4s better than a Dominix
---
penif doing God's work. Good man!
---
Not trying to downplay this but there's a reason that TNT is seen as a feeder alliance.
---
Drone ships are very versatile and easy to use, that's why semi afk players love them. However, the only non-terrible  strategy is sentries because they don't have to move they can instantly switch targets meaning they don't waste time between targets. Would you rely on heavies or mediums it would take AGES to get a whole pocket killed.
---
Turret ships complete missions faster because for the most part npc come straight at you meaning a large portion of the tracking equation works in your favour (the other part being target sig radius vs gun "size"). But it DOES mean you have to actively put in effort to prioritise the  right targets and watch your piloting as it can affect your tracking.
---
So for easy/lazy modus use drones (or missiles), they take VERY little input and can be flown by a brain dead zombie. It also means it'll be boring as hell so use it for a semi-afk alt or when you have to play semi-afk, or if you're a brain dead zombie.
---
The Blaster Kronos is a bit of a gimmick but can work well in short range missions (Damsel being one), otherwise you're forced to dart around on MWD getting in to range and wasting time doing so. Missions generally favour ranged strategies, So blasters (while cool and giving high dps numbers) is not ideal.
---
The rail Kronos is often overlooked because it doesn't do super amazing dps, it it also doesn't have limited damage types like the Paladin or be forced to work in falloff like the AC Vargur while still having decently good tracking (better than an arty Vargur) and decently ok damage types (Kin/therm is never really bad). So it doesn't have outstanding features that make you go "wow" but it's a steady performer that's never really out of place anywhere.
---
In a Golem I'd tend to always use it since the Missle velocity means you sometimes save yourself a volley on a target that dies seconds later from the last volley which is still in flight. 
---
I suppose you'd only use bastion on Turret ships if you need the Tank or the Range.
---
If you have drone skills fly the Rattlesnake instead of the Dominix, most L4s cam be run at snipe range with an mjd.
---
Basic fit would be somethingllike:
---
Arbalest/T2 cruise or torp launchers with 2 Drone link augmenters in the highs
---
2 mission specific shield resists, a target painter, mjd, and 2 drone mods for optimal/tracking in the mids
---
3 drone damage amps, 2 ballistic control units and a damage control in the lows
---
And either shield or missile rigs
---
Don't you get the shakes in Rocket League tho?
---
the 5 dreads could transform into t2 titans and murder every goon citadel, kill their mothers, scare their children and play with their sister’s dolls if the goonies upset them... he s making sure everything is safe
---
You can still have that happen with a prebuilt. Ideally they'll test all machines before they roll them out, realistically, you would be surprised how often that doesn't happen. Not to mention the fact that unless you know anything about what you should be getting, you can get the wrong components in there. Do a brief search and see how many people ordered a "custom" PC only to have it come configured incorrectly with the default build parts or completely different parts. Sometimes they do get returned and recycled for use in other builds
---
So from your replies you seem to be making a point of them being your dreads and them dying from multi boxing and not input broadcasting.
---
Doth protest too much methinks.
---
aren't sentry drone Rigs better for L4s? I mean, you might squeeze out more DPS on paper, but Sentries are used a lot more than the Cruises, right?
---
Loving the effort that has gone in with GoT names and actually trying to make them look like the character
---
Now a lot of it is simply plug and play. Go back to the days when you did actually have to know what you were doing. Ever had to manually assign resources using jumpers on an expansion card?

You still have to know a little bit more than the average bear though.

Most people are familiar with the "bait a response fleet then drop the real hammer" tactic at this point, so ya they probably were trembling a lil bit.
---
faction ammo is very ineffecient for sleeper sites where you use a lot of it for not much gain, i did the calculations and t1 ammo gives better isk/hr
---
yep
---
the gila hull alone is 200mil. the praxis entire fit up there is around 150. also the gila requires far more attention to fly than just soaking up all the damage
---
No need to purchase more when the price is this high. Plex and related items are the ones suffering from inflation. Most other items are quite stable and cheap.

&gt;Maybe you could go read some of the endless threads that have already been posted on the topic?

Maybe you could stop regurgitating bullshit? Price is pushed up by multiboxers and bots and the situation will likely continue to deteriorate.

How do we take down the Bad Dragon?

its actually really interesting that you mention that, the c3 site part is definitely true i do them with a friend sometimes and we can clear a site in 6-8 mins

Waitwait. You're taking ansiblexes, multiple, many times, per day, in a cheapfit dread, and seeing nothing wrong with it. 
---
Small wonder Test logistic people hate their lives...
---
The biggest issue I have with the Praxis (and by extension all the SoCT and CONCORD ships) is their resist profile: 25% or 33% everything. That flat omniresist just bugs me because you can't get it to have actually really good resists unless you burn 4 or 5 slots on it (for a Rainbow +1). (As opposed to any other ship, which has an obvious hole or two to fill and so you fill the hole then go omni.)
---
I also used to use a Praxis for solo C3 though. Cheap little thing, tanked good, rapid heavies, kept getting annoyed by sleepers shooting drones though. (... why don't I use that Praxis any more? i left my old corp and had to leave the praxis behind because I couldn't haul everything out.)
---
&gt; i have a friend who uses a armor rail hyperion and who shits on the praxis at every oppurtunity and refuses to switch even after i proved to him i have over double the tank,more dps and better application as well as being around 50m cheaper. 
---
Your friend needs to stop being a derp.

Clearly you care enough to come up with excuses on Reddit

The meme of me broadcasting already died for anyone with a brain when I live twitched tens of hours of activity. I don't need this thread for that

So hostile lol.

Only update Local When you are on grind with said neut.
---
I think maybe I underestimated how bad it actually was. I hope you get the help you need.
---
Note that the Praxis has no/very shit insurance, so it actually works out quite a bit more expensive than a normal T1 battleship.
---
OK, so we both agree that newbies can be useful in a fleet then.
---
Just join their coms and give spoilers
---
Navy Domi.
---
FWIW the blaster Kronos is actually awesome for missions - with a few tracking comps you are hitting past 70 km with Null loaded, while still doing more DPS than a Domi. And anything closer than ~20 km just melts with Void. Plus, with the MJD cooldown bonus for marauders it is so much easier to hop around the field blapping everything in sight. Kronos is one of the funnest ships I've missioned in.
---
70 km is 43.5 miles
---
How many Black Stone fortresses are you wiling to sacrifice in this crusade?
---
Due to the state of this subreddit, I dont know if you really dont know or if you are baiting, but he listen all of the usual excuses used by Goon&amp;Co.
---
Not for years, not since they changed the Rattlesnake's bonuses. Not it does roughly equal dps between cruise &amp; sentries (assuming t2 of both). Rattlesnake really is a lvl 4 beast though - with good skills it can get past 1,500 dps with fantastic range and a beastly passive shield tank.
---
Depends. I generally use a Blaster Kronos and MWD in the middle of a group, Bastion up and obliterate anything as Null with Bastion shoots out to 50 km and 1000dps.
---
50 km is 31.07 miles
---
The tutorial is awful but do it anyway, don't bother salvaging any wrecks during as they are just worthless. The agents available after the tutorial will give you free ships and a good amount of isk and will teach you about some of the careers

Short AAR: Final Triumvirate Athanor timer. Triumvirate had a 30 pilot Machariel fleet with Minokawa support and some dreadnoughts ready to drop. Snuffed Out had a 35 pilot Legion fleet with 10 or so dreadnoughts ready to drop with several force auxiliaries just in case.
---
Triumvirate was present on the Athanor while Snuffed Out bridged on a perch. Snuffed Out was further reinforced by a Banderlogs Alliance 15 pilot Maelstrom fleet with a Minokawa serving as logistics wing. Triumvirate had around 25 pilot Siege Green Brutix navy issue fleet for backup.
---
With both allies on the field, the two alliances clashed on the Athanor. For a few minutes, no side could break the other as force auxiliaries and the Snuffed Out logistics wing proved on the ball. Snuffed Out decided to escalate first, bringing in a force auxiliary and 5 dreadnoughts. Triumvirate responded with 8 dreadnoughts and 2 more force auxiliaries. At this point Snuffed Out brought the reminder of their dreadnoughts and the two sides brawled on the Athanor.
---
The dreadnought fight went bad for Triumvirate, who did manage to destroy a few Snuffed Out dreadnoughts but lost most of its own as well 2 of the 3 force auxiliaries. Ranger Regiment came to reinforce Triumvirate with a 44 pilot Ishtar fleet but arrived late.
---
As Snuffed Out pressed its advantage, destroying the Athanor in the process, server shutdown occurred. Both sides waited for the server to come back online before continuing to fight. Once both fleets re-organized, Triumvirate decided to bail out, with Siege Green and Ranger Regiment following suit. Snuffed Out managed to destroy a few stragglers before extracting its own surviving capitals. Once grid was clear, Banderlogs Alliance claimed the moon as Snuffed Out looted the field and went home.

Almost as if Imperium and Legacy are only friendly when fighting people they dislike more than each other

ah k so a shitpost. gochya
---
Pretty good rolling battleship
---
You’re all seen as feeders to me.
---
Honestly there are only 1 or 2 cases, be it regular L4 or epic arcs, that would require the need for the Kronos (bastion specifically). 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
One of those is The Blockade: Serpentis variant. That one features multiple Corelum Guardian spawns that will utterly ruin your targeting if you're flying a Dominix. With the Kronos, bastion makes you invulnerable to all e-war outside of neuts, so you can just flip them off and keep blasting away.
---
Another "mission" would be Studio 1, the penultimate combat mission in the Gallente epic arc. You'll be up against battleship rats that can (and will) mwd on top of you, and they hit for a good order of magnitude harder than your standard mission rat. Taking the Kronos for the extra tank would make things a lot easier.
---
As mentioned already, if you have semi-decent missile skills then you could do worse than looking at a Rattlesnake. You would have the 50% damage boost for TH/KIN missiles already and it's not prohibitively expensive (compared to the Kronos anyway!).

You literally have no clue you arrogant twit.

You're crying about people not playing the game. Get a fucking grip

The stats are wrong,a kitey wolf goes 3700, a jag goes 4000 and a svipul goes 2900 in speed .That said,while the svipul is still a good ship it gets outclassed by the wolf bc of its faster speed.It is way easier to deal with jaguars and inties in a wolf and yes you can kill an jag before he runs out of booster bc you can punch through his buffer. If you want to go for a fast kiter a wolf is a better choice then a svipul.
---
you must be very out of the loop if you dont know what I am talking about.
---
"No need to purchase more when the price is this high."
---
They don't have to buy it themselves anymore, the scarcity they have already created means the people who do want to buy it are driving the price higher for them  
---
" Price is pushed up by multiboxers and bots and the situation will likely continue to deteriorate. " 
---
demand is only half the equation, without a meaningful price cut the supply will continue to be limited  
---
" Maybe you could stop regurgitating bullshit? "   
---
I don't see you offering any theories for the increase except "multiboxers and bots are bad mmmmkay" and that's pretty much the definition of regurgitated bullshit in relation to this topic.  
---
" the situation will likely continue to deteriorate. " only if you're a buyer, sellers are loving this, people I've played with over the years who never would have flipped plex for isk before are doing it now because of the payout.
---
Im not crying at anything, im trying to explain that your logic is flawed because you are a dribbling moron.
---
Wait, is that a good AAR... on r/eve ?!
---
I guess it is another sign of the pending apocalypse.
---
That group is not affiliated with TEST. On first glance it looks like that invite only cool kids club that has members from all around new eden.
---
Take an Ishtar (330mil), she may have less dps (~750), but is faster in warp than an bb and makes with an oversized AB 1065 m/s in the sides.
---
but that means being in Bastion all the time, so exactly as I said: You have to dart into range, drop into bastion, kill some stuff, move again.  
---
Besides it's still falloff so you lose lots of dps at range. It's overall slower than a rail Kronos unless it's a short range mission. If you *enjoy* playing that way then sure but that's a personal thing, not an overall recommendation.
---
&gt;and hiding all existing sigs from probe scanner

He has a poor grasp of wormholes as well...lol!

literal retards reply to me every day with random bullshit
---
i wish everyone with an iq under 90 died instantly overnight
---
Flawed logic to do basic checks? Lol
---
The same thing happened to my friend. He undocked from a station, and it put him inside of the station. If i got close enough i could manoeuvre the camera to see him bumping the inside of the station. He re logged and it fixed it though. Sorry you lost your ship to something  so stupid. Pm me your kill mail and I'll reimburse you for your ship. I hate to see a newbro get screwed like that.
---
Years ago CCP did sell models of some of the ships like the Megathron, etc.  They eventually stopped doing so because apparently they were losing money on the venture.
---
That's how I feel whenever somebody bitches about things (or the company just nerfs things) instead of thinking your way around the problem.
---
All that effort, for a drop of blood.
---
Titans are cheap anyways.
---
Real life is some inconvenient shit
---
Utility though. 
---
A svipul can have a web if an inty gets in scram range. , with some doing you can fit a small neut. 
---
I'll give it to you that the wolf is better at kiting but i dont think it makes the Svipul irrelevant.
---
Looks like good fun regional content was had \o/

Snuff are mean snobs led by a rageaholic named Tau and an underage virgin named Hy that combined their powers to destroy EVE lowsec. Fair it is not.

Lol made you post

Good kills my man.
---
Is it more or less fun than posting from a smurf account on Reddit?
---
The only thing that deals with those is RLML + neuts or scram/web/blaster. 
---
If you want to kite a jag in something small just be aligned and warp when it gets close
---
I also found out recently you can find quite cheap abyssal ballistics that are either +speed and -damage or +damage and -speed and if you get two of each that's better than four normals, and you get rid of that useless nanofiber :D
---
Anyway, great vid, ballsy fights, sexy commentary.

Now that CCP Peligro has done his one good deed for CCP, Hilmar can let him go along with all the other useful devs in a continuation of long-standing CCP SOP.

Because it is the correct "theory". There is nothing else that can sustain this price.

People take space pixels so seriously

Back in the day (well probably just this time last year) we had an alliance competition, most solo kills in one month flying an SoCT ship.  Prize was a super.  Points were applied based on hull size used, so BS got 3 points for any kill (as long as it wasn't within close proximity of a gate, so camping wasn't possible).  Everyone jumped into smaller stuff, was watching the scores come in over the first few days.
---
I had a stupid idea: Antifrig Cruise; a wiff of a hull tank, everything else was damage, application and tackle and a heavy neut.  Only prop mod was MJD.  Should get good hits out to ~100km.
---
Just went out into low-sec looking to get tackled, they had a choice - hold me with a long point and get hit, come into scram range and get double tapped.  Worked out quite nicely. 
---
Took it out twice, hit the top spot on the leader board and watched everyone else struggle and fail to catch up.
---
The moral of the story is; there are no bad ships per se, if you fit it for a purpose it'll be fine.  Turns out the Praxis can be a reasonable anti frig platform, well until everyone works out what you're doing. I never tried but because of the size of the model it might also be an interesting static smartbomber.

It's a shit fleet ship, mind.

---
Seriously though, maybe it's good to have a game like EVE around which isn't instant gratification and low effort for newbies. In that respect, Eve's weakness is also a strength because it's not just another copy of whatever is fashionable at the moment. 
---
Botting, however, is not in any way a strength of the game.
---
Buying gametime and selling sp  is just a convoluted way to sell plex directly. The interessting point is the cost of sp for accounts payed for with plex

Nah, it's all right. Thank you. I still have plenty of ISK from afk mining, and I like to earn my ships. This is just a hard lesson for me.
---
Or just remove FW
---
Ok cool !!!!
---
If they add a captha popping out at random times between 0 and 30 minutes when your afk miners are harvesting the spod it would be fine.
---
Wasnt it you Who said 8 actions per server tick is broadcasting?
---
Could someone explain to me the Warp Scram/Disrupt mechanics?
---
My understanding is that I can still MWD when disrupted but not when scrammed.
---
Do core stabilisers factor into the above at all? ie. If i have a warp core strength of 3 but someone scrams me, does that mean I can still MWD? I understand I can warp out but lets assume I'm in a bubble and being scrammed.
---
This provably false though looking at datasets provided during his economic panels at fanfests. Inflation and deflation were actually mamaged very well under his tenure...
---
Since he left however...well i cant recall the last time Ive seen an economic report with a higher volume of ISK leaving circulation.

" Speaking of our markets you may have noticed that our market in 08-N7Q is not great.  Nor is D-PNP9.  The reason for that is we don't have enough people importing goods to put on the market. "

this fit hurts my eyes.
---
Its as much a scam site as ebay. Stick to vendors with good rep and lots of sales and you cant go wrong
---
delete this
---
Then where would you get all them dank navy ships and ammo?
---
that depends on how many tracking computers you use and how much you want to be in Bastion. 
---
If you use Bastion are your main strategy then you can use shorter range ammos and can get away with just 2 normal ammo types (antimatter and a max target range one) and Javelin. If you just use it as a panic button then you'll need longer range ammos and thus more/different types to cover all the ranges, and Javelin.
---
Site is legit but just like ebay, not all the vendors are. Doesnt take big brain to figure which vendors are legit there

Make them limited edition so those of us with hangar full of napocs can become trillionaires

Do you mean the player who are now bitching on reddit because they can't achieve anything in game so they want CCP to "fix" the game for them ?
---
 "Create formal battlelines by only allowing plexing on opposing faction systems that are connected to each other. "
---
This is the best FW fix ever but lp krabs will vote against it.
---
You need some rum first
---
They are not only part of the reason for plex prices though.      
---
They also are part of the problem around cap and super balancing (including rorquals).      
---
If injectors had increased player counts, because it helps new players more than old, that might have been worth it. But they don't and it isn't.
---
What is the best damage type to do for the different types of ships in Abyssal space?
---
I've read a bunch of guides and a lot of them just say "there are different spawns at random, so best damage type depends on spawns", but I can't see to find anything that specifically says "shoot X damage type at X type of ships".  Any thread/guide about that would be welcome.  Or you can just tell me what you normally do.

Right now I've just been shooing mostly Nova at things in Darks.

There is a ratting site in drone regions that if you warp to wrong distance, you bump yourself to death with a Huge structure.

Many, many new bros VNI rest in peperoni...

nice pr fishing right before rubal is exonerated and you're embarassed
---
Yes. For lowsec i would just go frig since you can get into all the FW sites then.
---
&gt; Should I just be a destroyer, fit it out and roam low/null sec?
---
Good way to become food for real pirates. Do what everybody else does, train 5 pilots for frigs, boot multibox and hunt solo pvpers in dest/cruisers.

Poke and eye out , scream AGRRRR while doing it.. then sit on a gate and poke someone else

I read it more as snarky banter tbh.

&gt;that same $20 might get you like 10bil ISK (just guessing).

it *might* get you whatever they're telling you it'll get you, because it's not legit

'Original kings of lowsec' excuse me while I laugh :D

from what I posted in the templis discord:
---
if ccp fixes fw you're all gonna hate it
---
you have to understand there's literally no way to fix fw. If you boost the rewards players will still gravitate towards the easiest isk/hr
---
when Rorquals were changed and found to be afk isk printing juggernauts a majority of players went to groups where it's safest to use them
---
regardless of what ccp does the players will game the

ideally fw should just be a small scale content generator which it was before snuff ruined it

I meant that I burn ceptors back and forth quite often. We used them for a few move ops because you can just refuel as you go by keping fuel in the dread and it's like 5 times faster then midding them over.
---
A lot of good ideas, but any attempt to create a group to make proposals about FW should include Lowsec in general... because you know, militias are not the only groups living there and thus you guys are missing the point of view of a significant part of the area's population.
---
That is a very good point. I should be doing that.
---
Why should he ?
---
Good way to feed my SFIs more kills
---
Noted.
---
Amazing explanation, I’m kinda a nerd, math and computer science is very interesting to me. Thanks for enlightening me and taking the time to scratch the curious itch! Very interesting stuff!
---
I use the newmap on all three of my chars.
---
dont @ me bro
---
It's not tho.
---
Can you insure a fit for this should I use rockets, turrets, what?
---
Hope you experience FAX at some point. They collide with themself sometimes
---
Nobody mentions a mach?
---
Sadly this will be "yet another waste of time". I repeat myself: If we don't find something to abuse, noone in Reykjavik cares for fixing/improving FW.  
---
Hilmar confirmed it in his AMA
---
Welcome to fun. Having been various forms of "pirate" for about 5 years, there's lots of ways to have fun and sometimes even make isk while killing people.
---
The first things you want to do are learn to fight and learn how to find fights.
---
How to fight: "eve is easy" on youtube is an excellent starting point, that covers frigate 1v1 fundamentals. Lasker Emanuel has been posting vids that also cover some good points he hits in his learning. Watching these when I came back to solo has been a nice refresher course, and I'm already winning more fights than I'm losing again. Once you can do it in a frigate, doing it in bigger ships against more opponents is a natural transition. Brawling is easier than kiting to start with, but you'll find kiting has a lot more opportunity to take targets brawlers can't.
---
How to find fights: plexes in Black Rise have always been a hotspot for 1v1 and 1vtrap. Paranoia and experience will teach you which is which.
---
If you're looking to ransom people: sadly with the ways of nullsec blocs these days it's dead. You get on someone and hold them for ransom, standing fleet is just going to rescue their asses and you'll have a much tougher escape and no time to loot them. Hitting ratters and miners is the realm of the small nullsec gang. I spent years fcing those almost every night, getting so addicted to it that I accidentally shut down all of provi for three months lol. Remember not to kill your content.
---
If the problem is unchecked ultra safe anomaly farming, why do you think cloaky camping is the appropriate solution to it?  
---
This tells me you're somewhat lacking in imagination.  Why don't you try to think up some fun and engaging gameplay that has the same effect of reducing unchecked ultra safe anomaly farming, but that doesn't also reduce all other kinds of farming, where the farmers in question don't have the benefit of an umbrella or anything else for that matter.
---
For example, Goons will rarely drop for subs (unlikely a sub will have a cyno anyway) unless baiting.  There are lots of non-bot farmers in subs.  Are they a "problem" in Eve?  Or is it the botters + supers/rorquals you object to?  If that, CCP already have the tools to make those less safe, and they exercised them only recently.
---
In conclusion, if there's a problem then cloaky camping isn't the solution.
---
The fuck are these 6000ms RAMJags? I've been out of the game for a long time. The fuck is this fit?
---
Thank you, I’ll get right on it!
---
The lack of insurance makes it's market value that much lower.
---
You end up losing about the same with praxis or insured T1 BS.
---
This all looks good.
---
Spent more in fuel than he'll pay to replace it/yeah well what about the other ones/yeah well you were in &lt;Corp in your history&gt; so lol
---
of course it was a boson ratter
---
OF COURSE
---
Now this is quality content!
---
I still cruise around FW and get fights. The "warfare" part of FW seems to be as manipulated by giant blocs and supercapitals as any other war in eve, but even then you get plex fights. I got caught in the middle of a huge one last night.
---
Finally my griffin navy stash by be worth something. Lol
---
It's not like it takes an abundance of time or effort to drop your ideas on the Faction War discord and ask opinions or vote on them. Even if they aren't trying to fix faction war right now, having a pool of player supported ideas to pull from can only help.
---
All hail MANGO
---
While the discord is geared to FW, anyone is welcome to join. I'm in it and I'm in NC.
---
this is too high quality for r/eve please make it worse to fit in.

Basically just the pinnacle of Heavy tackle atm. 300-400 dps tank without the Assault damage control ( until cap boosters run out)or 1200-1400dps tank with the ADC for 15 seconds.

---
So, is it a good time to start investing in PLEX now?
---
It is great you are doing this but some of your postulates are pants on head retarded. I d suggest running your list through an adult before you give it to mangos to vote on.
---
Don't understand the reference, and am too afraid to Google that.
---
Expect to lose a lot of ships starting out and realize that hisec income by and large blows ass. You may need to find more isk sources, especially as you graduate from the 5m t1 frigate to the navy and pirate faction options, or larger hulls. Not every great solo pvper sticks to frigs in FW plexes - Zarvox got famous for his Scythe Fleet Issue and Comet shenanigans in null, Lasker Emanuel is as known for his yolo dread fights as his frigate stuff. Chesseur flew nothing but Navy Slicers for 7 years and got really good at it. I got good at intercepting kitey bullshit gangs with combat probes or cloaky tackle bombers when I was flying with big nullsec blobs lol.
---
...is that supposed to be a 50MN?
---
I know what you mean about addiction. I keep thinking about this game and you fuckers got me back again last night. Prepare for thrashers and JD.
---
Salavin always writes top notch reports.
---
I think it has potential to be changed in a way that you can still make money from FW, and good money, however it should be more based around PvP than anything. 
---
Starting with missions - those need nerfed. I should not be able to go in a 120m Hecate and do an assassination mission in 10 minutes and receive 50m+ from it! 
---
Personally, I want a ranking system that means something. We all have the ranks that we get from standings but they’re completely useless. There is so much potential for the ranking system to tie in both PvP activity and time in service, and tie LP rewards to rank more than the tier system. 
---
Just to give an example, to rank up to the first rank you need to be in the militia for one week and be involved (your name somewhere on the killmail) of 5 enemy militia kills. Take LP away from the current tier system and reward more LP for the higher ranking people (you know, just like real life!). Lose rank if you awox or leave the militia. 
---
I don’t know, something like that.
---
Nope, thats a 5mn.
---
Thats just copied from Pyfa where im reading the stats
---
If you were to somehow fit a 50mn it would go 10k cold.
---
Ayyyyyy welcome back into the fold!
---
It's interesting he included you guys on the list at all, considering your long-standing diplomatic status of "kill literally anything/everything that moves".
---
Yeah, I didn’t go into too much depth but if you check out the voting section of the discord there is a template to follow and one of the sections of that template is “Who it affects outside of FW and how it affects them” because we understand that is something to consider!
---
Huh. Interesting. I'm at the office so I don't have pyfa to paste it in, it just felt like a 50mn fit.
---
Alright, gonna have to throw that in.
---
Start small, freight a bunch of frigs and ammo to ammamake sell half and blow up the other. You will get isk back lot of fun and valuable experience.
---
ist really fucks up solo pvp Content which a lot of fw members do
---
Sadly you’re right - however if we make enough fuss we could stir it up! These FW talks always pop up and die out, so hopefully this time we can keep the momentum going. Two major issues we face; 1. The portion of the player base that participate in FW is low, low enough to make it not important to CCP and 2. It’s such a difficult topic, as we’ve seen from the multiple attempts to “fix” it that unless we coordinate and bring something solid to CCP (such as the information/suggestions from these polls) we’ll never see FW love, and our glorious Federation will never be as good as it once was!
---
Blessed rest of eve
---
Oh, ratting titan lol rip
---
i lold
---
First, unless you try to ransom ships you're not a pirat, you're a PvPer. Then, load some frigate or destroy in your closest FW system and go loose them. Try to figure out why and understand all the mechanics. If you are using T1 frigates, don't engage any pirate frigate, it's basically suicide.
---
Also join a corp.
---
This one was an interesting idea, however it would screw with tactics such as going deep into enemy territory, setting up a staging, and lying siege to a backend system for some kind of tactical situation. 
---
One of my personal proposals - which would be an awesome way to utilize the Agency window - set weekly objectives and target systems. One week have the Gallente on the offense, assigning some system as a primary target and two other systems as alternates with some sweet LP/Faction rewards if we capture them (or reward the opposing militia if they defend), and the next week the Caldari goes on the offensive!
---
Don't most people use the -hp +speed implant, or are you assuming they also would use the +hp -dps one on top of it or instead of?
---
Thanks again TNT and Theta for making my dreams come true. &lt;3
---
Ninja huffing is fine if you've got a few buddies/alts. 15 minutes can easily full clear a site before the sleepers spawn.

---
I LOL’d at the pants on head retarded part hahah. 
---
Honestly, any idea/vote is welcome and needed. I think next time I post this (while I Hope to do regularly with updates on numbers and new ideas) I’ll set a baseline, such as only keeping updates on ideas that have a 50% or higher approval!
---
Expected a lazy link to zkill got a good aar. Not disapointed but surprised.
---
Taiwan #1!
---
Excellent post!
---
Most of these of designed at restoring meaning to warzone control which would go a long way towards boosting FW in general.  Very little here about boosting rewards, believe it or not many of us still in FW aren't in it for the rewards.
---
Reeing about how Snuff killed it does nothing to advance the conversation around FW, they aren't going anywhere and they are going to change.
---
&gt;What is the point then? I do not understand. You aren't fighting if you are just running all the time.
---
To get a fight both sides can win, the issue is when you form stuff where there is 0 win conditions for me what do you expect i'm gonna sit there and watch my fleet die?
---
All I saw was [this](https://gfycat.com/unawaredependentfruitbat).
---
I have not seen a more sane explanation of what this place is in ages.
---
What is this thing even doing here?
---
Nope, the best solution is to ban Chinese player from playing in Tranquility. LOL ~
---
BTW, do you just want someone to take on the charges of bot and RMT issues which were already exist? ?If it’s true, those Serenity players seem like did choose a wrong time to join Tranquility
---
sry...I#m very bittervet about all this, since Hilmar literally said "It is not and it will not be on the roadmap" in his AMA.
---
The only way to get content in FW is to loose system by intention. Falling back to T1 was the best thing to happen for Gallente. Now we finally have something to shoot without getting negative security status or negativ standing.
---
moneybadger vibes from the kill squad 😍😍
---
No, but we can dream.
---
&gt; which isn't instant gratification and low effort for newbies.
---
Yeah, that's the thing though. Waiting for skills to train isn't effort. In other games, you actually play the game in order to progress. Skill Injectors helped a little bit in that regard, but most people still look at that wall of +% damage, +% rate of fire, +% velocity, and they just leave. 
---
If the system were actually effort based, or actually forced you to specialize (read: there was an upper limit on how many skillpoints you could actually have) then it might be interesting. But right now it's just obnoxious. 
---
Botting is also obviously aids.
---
Caps, and supers especially can carry enough fuel to refuel it.
---
Unpopular opinion - I don’t think Snuff killed FW! Groups want to operate in a certain way, but that means being a target to Snuff. FW gives us the unique opportunity to limit what groups like Snuff can do. Sure it’s hard - but you can live out of NPC stations and Snuffs capitals can only enter the large complexes and nothing else. I guess they can severely disrupt ihub bashes, but they’re not a 24/7 group.
---
k.
---
imagine only having 80 bil
---
Not disenfranchised. I'm in the casual ground between the truly enfranchised and the disenfranchised (tbh, the only hobby I can really be classed as enfranchised is Magic the Gathering, as that's the game I can play with the widest portion of my friends, where they all run screaming when I mention Eve).
---
They aren't.  You pay for convenience and IT'S WORTH IT.  I make enough money that it saves me money and my mental health to do so.  I am a server admin so I have a very good idea how to build PCs, it's just really nice not to now.  Have a good day grumps.
---
A bunch of people expecting to be bombed use the +hp implant
---
Holy shit this is so good
---
So you are correct when you say, "I can still MWD when disrupted but not when scrammed." 
---
That is the purpose.  The Disruptor is 24km scram is like 9km.   So you gotta put yourself in more danger to turn off their MWD.  
---
The core stabs just affect your warp core.  You still lose your MWD if you're scrammed but if the numbers of the stabs vs their scram numbers (1 for disrupter tech 2, 2 for scram tech 2) check out you can still warp out.  
---
If you are in a bubble?   The bubble applies like 999 disruptions to your ship.  You have to exit that bubble first then warp.    You can MWD in bubbles because the effect is a disrupt, not a scram.
---
Cool thoughts, I like the idea of objectives.
---
I agree with you 100% there.  They have certainly changed the dynamic, good luck with any small scale capital warfare or owning anything larger than an Astrahaus.  Snuff is certainly a frustrating factor, especially for newbros who don't understand why Titans are grinding their structures but FW can and should adapt around these things.
---
Wait, Triumvirate isn't dead?
---
I don't think his bot was programmed to.
---
Maybe this could work: put systems with active plexes on the F10 map of players in the opposing militias in real time. When anyone enters a plex, they instantly reset any progress of the opposing side, and receive half in loyalty points of what that progress would have been worth to the enemy side. 
---
E.g.an  Amarr militia is 80% to complete a  10.000 loyalty point site, a Minmatar enters the plex, the Amarrian leaves -&gt; the site is reset and the matari earns 4000 points.

I just disagree and I dont think they are so unbalancing.
---
Ill explain for the random generic goon linemember #45 678. Boris was caught RMT'ing but leadership let it slide and everyone else involved was banned.
---
Are you saying that the Minmatar pilot gets 4000 as soon as the Amarrian flies away? 
---
That’d be a huge LP exploit if that’s what you’re getting at, however it’d be an interesting idea to add LP pools to highly contested complexes! Say two sides go back and forth over the time with many, many deaths inside, and at the very end of the long bloody fight whoever captures the complex gets a bigger reward due to it being so highly contested.
---
It wouldn't be an exploit because the site would have to be built up by the Amarrian to begin with, and it instantly destroys all the progress of the Amarrian, and makes the whole hit and run LP farming less viable.
---
I have always loved FW. Every time I come back I dip my toes. These changes would be great.
---
Why didint you camp the NPC stations? Bad BBTB!
---
Damn showoff, trying to make everyone else look bad
---
You say that as if goon leadership calls the shots on who gets banned for RMT, you unoriginal pubbie

---
I know it's more or less entirely cosmetic, but I think it would be great if the "Rank" tab under a character's profile decorations remained even after leaving FW. It's silly, but as a newbie those look really damn cool and it's a bit disheartening to know that there'll be no evidence of my efforts on my profile if I decide to join a regular non fw corp
---
I clicked on the Isk guide just to see how out dated it was and saw an isk guide to Dust 514. It confirmed my thoughts, but also made me feel sad.

meanwhile many players who cant plex now are moving to albion online that became f2p.
---

---
No one said anythinf about hating anyone in real life. The tinfoil was directed to the idea that was lingering around eve. The idea of "All wars are staged to create content to bored f1 monkeys who got nothing else better to do other than bash rocks and shoot rats all day" sheesh. :Rollseyes:
---
What region would that be in...CENTRAL RUSSIA!!!
---
Another difficulty with FW - finding ways to exploit stuff. If this were implemented, I’d coordinate with a buddy to run a site and let me run him off to claim instant LP. It’s definitely a really good idea to reset or accelerate the time a complex timer resets if someone runs out to avoid a fight!
---
But you can take the boy out of SLC and put him in Central Russia. All you have to do is feed him blood...RIGHT?
---
doesnt make it irrelevant but it is defiantly weaker then the wolf as a kiter and maybe as a brawler as well in many situations.The AF powercreep is real. I also think the jaguar is a bit too strong. It makes a lot of ships very weak in solo pvp. Ships like harb or oni are very bad for solo pvp because of this meta. Even the Retri while being a ship with very good stats is not very good atm bc it cant deal with an jag.
---
I wish there was a bot that could detect lies and impersonations.

They could just add very large bonuses for plexing a "battle line" system, while having the other systems remain the same. That and the objectives idea seem good to me.

The sooner the better. The chimese can circumvent their firewalls via vpns or so but i don't thibk it's as easy as that for bank accounts
---
This is the kind of post that Eve players live for (aka jo to)
---
The thing is a lot of people tolerated and worked within shitty FW mechanics until citadels came out. 
---
Even if there were a huge overhaul to FW, CCP would still need to address citadel spam or people will never come back.
---
/u/cactusjack48 when you left for Central Russia did you leave someone special home?
---
OP I'm commenting twice bc this is such a high quality meme. Top Tier. 15/10
---
Having to exercise patience could be seen as effort, perhaps.
---
I realise that you have some strong opinions on the subject, and you certainly have a valid point, however I personally quite like the skill training system because it rewards dedication and patience.
---
I also think that skill injectors have had a negative impact on the game by enabling botters. Not much effort involved in buying skill injectors really, is there?
---
So haw many blue books have you handed out this week? Because you sure spend alot of time here?
---
This was something I put forward at the fw round table back in fanfest 2013 I think it was. Along with having fw incursions in high sec when you held the low sec system next to high sec. If you captured it you would then be able to move on to the next high sec systems.
---
That way if one side held all the war zone there was still something to be done. Just think of those level 4 high sec runners waking up and finding Jita under Gallante control and navy shooting them! LOL!
---
Wow, and its only 74 bil, how incredibly sad and disappointing. The times were Titan hulls alone went for 220-250 are still fresh in my mind, nevermind the fit.
---
Actually it is Spectrum who has been bullying newbros.  Been sending out system wide demands for extortion to small new corps with structures demanding ransom or they will bash. Spectrum just recurved the same thing they have been dishing out. Rightly deserved.  Serious gratitude to Razor and Thieves Guild. Spectrum is the bully on the block.
---
Injectors... I was wondering why their price went up so muchm, while price of PLEX stayed mostly the same last month (it even went down a bit after the omega sale).
---
Cool sorry, brother. It's so good to have basically a relative in another country.  Hey on second thought could you bring me one of those Russian dolls there when you open one there is another, and another? They are soooooo cool.
---
I'm over here just thinking that mom looks pretty...
---
Yeah, should have done that when i started playing in January.... Well, i am always late to the party.
---
Well, finally a well written AAR. Thanks!
---
Exactly like when some one lies and tries to make it cool. Do you know someone that would know something about that /u/cactusjack48
---
Quite like that idea.
---
Fly a dual scram rocket bomber. Nemesis or manticore. Extra high slots are probe launcher and a cloak. Extra mids are enduring mwd and Sebo with eccm. Lows are DCU/BCS. Rigs are hull buffer. 
---
Now just camp a relic site somewhere in catch or Venal (best places to go in my experience), and kill any exploration frigates you see, with the exception of combat fit asteros. You can try to ransom them, but odds are they’ll refuse and you’ll have to settle for scooping their loot. 
---
You can also set up a drag bubble off a gate in a pipe and camp it with a brawling ship. Hecate is good if you’re new, t3cs/stratios is good if you don’t mind spending more isk. 
---
If you’re alpha just get a friend with dictors, and get yourself in a Daredevil, and camp gates. Your webs will keep stuff from crashing and you can bring a Hecate friend for more dps.
---
Please tell me your time in Central Russia did not run off and you got caught for this?
---
Are you telling fibs again.
---
Thats a very sketchy way to make assumptions though, the only thing that would show is how many been "continuously" playing since launch. The 50 day? skill queue is a "relative" new thing

This isn't what happens in my experience. As soon as its outside of gank territory they flee. They only stick around as long as they can keep killing our ships without taking any losses and leave as soon as we start bringing in more/bigger stuff. That's not fighting thats ganking.

Yeah, Spacebattles creative writing forum is a very good place to get feedback, and they tend to like scifi. There's more than a few Eve players that hang out there, I'm sure.
---
Gotta say, T2 as amarr is not bad. Our LPs are still super valuable, there's a lot of farmers (minmatar are at T3/4) and that means a lot of neutrals roaming through.
---
Short AAR: Theran Alliance Tatara shield reinforcement timer. Snuffed Out and Infinity Avenger formed a combined 105 pilot Legion/Zealot fleet. The force bridged on the Tatara and started bashing it. Guardians of the Galaxy (GotG)/Dead coalition (Dead.Co) or whatever they want to call themselves (for the rest of the AAR I shall refer to them as GotG) formed a 160 pilot Eagle fleet with Siberian Squads forming another estimated 40 pilot Eagle fleet with command destroyers to "Spearfish" (using a couple of command destroyers together to teleport into an enemy fleet and then teleport out a second later with part of the hostile fleet for easy kills).
---
The GotG Eagle fleet warped to the grid, landing at another citadel before warping again and landing at long range (100km+) of the Snuffed Out/Infinity Avenger fleet. Both sides started exchanging fire. GotG had difficulty breaking the Snuffed Out ships, only managing to down a single Zealot in the fight. While Snuffed Out/Infinity Avenger focused on the fleet's weaker ships, destroying its Celestic electronic warfare wing and squisher ships like Moa and Osprey cruisers.
---
The two sides kept going for many minutes, with Siberian Squads joining in and trying to spear fish the Legion/Zealot fleet with little success though it did kill all the support Crucifiers (RIP brave little ships). In the meantime, the Tatara was manned and started killing all the Legion/Zealot fleet drones (RIP my Warrior IIs), forcing Snuffed Out/Infinity Avenger to bring in a dreadnought to bash the structure as well as a couple of force auxiliaries just in case of further escalations.
---
The GotG fleet targeted the dreadnought before warping near the Snuffed Out/Infinity Avengers Guardians logistics cruiser wing. The Guardians burnt out of range while the Legion/Zealot fleet burned in, inflicting more losses. Whatsmore, the dreadnought was able to push the Tatara into its second reinforcement timer, winning the objective for the attackers. With the Tatara reinforced and the Legion/Zealot fleet burning in, the GotG Eagle fleet warped off, leaving the Siberian Squads one on the grid alone. After a chase that yielded just 1 Eagle kill for Snuffed Out/Infinity Avengers, Siberian Squads left as well.
---
Thus Snuffed Out/Infinity Avengers extracted capitals and left the system, ending the fight.
---
its great for c3 before you get a rattle

u/nolife_notime is the shitposter we need, but don't deserve.

Wtf are you even talking about? Can't you see he's in Rote Kapelle? It clearly says so right next to his name.
---
Yeh the Jag, especially the RAMjag is pretty damn good. Im not sure how you nerf if though without making it useless or taking away what makes it Minmatar. 
---
maybe make it a turret boat again and nerf the cpu so you can't fit 2 medium ancils without fitting mods
---
Bot for the alliance!!! hahahahaha
---
Yea, like 15m an hour...
---
&gt;for westerners shitposting is an essential part of playing eve
---
No, it's the only part that matters.
---
good idea to encourage Fighting between Groups
---
&gt;third: make a shitton of low effort memes
---
Literally this
---
That blood raider npc put in work.
---
F'n hilarious
---
Especially if you're doing it in Null-sec, and even more especially if you look at the ROI.  A few hours of skill-training plus a few million for a ship and you can make 10-20 million an hour.  A session of moon-mining will buy you several T1 frigates/destroyers, and a couple good moons will earn you enough to afford a VNI.    
---
Compare that to the week or so of training to get into a Procurer (requires Industry V) and the 20+ million ISK for the ship, a Venture isn't that bad an option.
---
holly shit a titan is only 60b now? geez
---
Oooh, interesting, I hadn't considered stacking penalty advantages with abyssal mods.
---
They look scary with those 4 active PvP toons and procurers. :D
---
Now we just need the Chinese translation.
---
Did I miss something? Is serenity being integrated?
---
&gt; know what RMT stands for or is it just one of those terms you throw around to try and fit in with the grr gons narrative?
---
If you watch him multibox all 7 accounts he doesn't get it all in a server tick not even close... sure its POSSIBLE but highly suspicious after the 7th account.
---
Venture is totally shit except if you are less than 2 month old in eve. if you plan to mine, it s better to be omega to fly barge, exhumer and rorqual. If you cant be omega you still can do BS mining while jettison, it will be better than the venture but a pain in the ass for still a low ISK/hr
---
This dude rums.
---
It was a good fight,
---
As someone mentioned Eve is Easy...that really is an excellent resource in learning tactics and how to get going.
---
If you are serious about doing the pvp thing, message me your ingame name and I'll hook you up with some frigates to go get blown up.  The best way to learn...buy 20-100 of the same frigate/fit and go fight until they all die.  You'll learn a lot.
---
Ok guys, we want your posts and memes, but can you maybe give us some english translations on your shitposts?
---
Rail Hyperion? I think I’m going to be sick.
---
another good AAR on reddit.. 2nd one today.. wtf
---
&gt;you are completely wrong. In many countries, civilized ones, there is very solid consumer protection law and if one company is selling something exclusively, they have quite a lot of ways how to prevent other individuals or companies selling their stuff.
---
Like I said, if you truly are a dumbfuck and its a small purchase, single time then the protections you speak of will basically kick in and you might even get your money back from the CC company although still be banned in the game.
---
But if it was a large purchase, worth several thousands $$$ or if there is a history of shady purchases on any of the related accounts, and it triggers flags to be investigated, then the excuses of being stupid and unaware are debunked and fly out the window. In this case the act will be intentional and you become responsible. 
---
The consumer protections will not apply any longer as you partake in the fraud rather then just be a victim of it.
---
My copilot is Jack Daniels
---
Ransoming's hard these days, by the time you get past the word "eject" there's 30 supers on grid
---
Don’t mind as an alpha, don’t mine as omega. If you want lazy isk rat, if you want heaps of active isk, explore. 
---
Also a personal advice, if you have isk in the billions and no expenses, never have it sit around for no reason, it’s 100% worth it doing a little market research and read about upcoming changes so you can invest your isk into something and have it grow over time, if you’re lazy to do that as well just buy plex.

Yes! Our remaining Chinese brothers from Serenity are migrating to TQ.
---
Interesting. I just looked at the front page and didn't see much. So they're closing serenity? Is there a write up somewhere?
---
I for one, welcome our new /r/highqualitygifs overlords.
---
Not allowed, Reddit posting is serious business
---
Its not what happens in general the locals will form a massive gang and then do the surprised pikachu when the 8 dudes refuse to engage. 
---
The more that happens the less likely people in your region will become to fight you as you get more and more of a reputation for killing content ( this used to be a bad thing back in the old eve days ).
---
can you log in and try it?
---
Extract and RMT/use the isk before it happens ?
---
They aren't closing. It's just that the other largest group that hasn't come over is now moving as well. It's not an official thing, just a giant alliance moving.
---
wtf i love snuff now
---
Oh, ok. Wonder how they're getting around the great firewall.
---
&gt;Because 2b is too much for anyone. I mean, as a PLEX seller it's all good for me, but I don't  need 2B every month so I'm definitely not going to purchase any more than I need. The higher it gets, the less often I need to sell some. I the meanwhile, the argument of "you can buy subscription with IG farming" goes away at that price. 1.5b is already a pain.
---
2B is only too much for single account VNI ratters, alphas doing HS L3 missions etc. It is still way too low in too many cases.
---
Is CAS Combat Day still a thing?
---
God damn it took you two years to remove kebab, and you’re being about as big a shitlord as possible 😂
---
ignoring the last part: yes.

go back to wormholes before you make more nullsec entities invade ya.

what's the context of the original clip?
---
you can totally recruit your alt, I made use of the system last week to make a market toon with more that sufficient skills for sitting in jita and station trading.
---
as for what you should do, find a niche you want to try, make an alt, have fun
---
Adding more triglavian ships will fix that. Don't worry. ;)
---
I think I'm the only one hoping it actually did feature advanced geometry. 😞
---
This is no joke. Depth perception is a known cause of failure to pirate effectively.

For me this is cap stable with all modules on, 63% resists across the board with 351 hp/s shield boosting.  It puts out 718 first rack DPS (573 sustained)  It gets 67km range missiles and 69km range drones.  Obviously mileage varies with skill training.
---
The premise is that this is for PVE, and if you get ganked it doesn't matter if you're in a 200m Praxis or a 700m Rattle.  You might escape or not, but your DPS isn't part of that equation.  You can step this fit up with more faction or T2 gear, but personally for C3 PVE I don't see the benefit of the added expense.  The one expensive part of the build is the Pith shield booster.  A really solid more affordable option is the Gurista's version.  But this is an area where you want to spend ISK, since most of the slots in this build are for maximizing the benefit of that booster.  I'd also recommend checking contracts for the abyssal variant.  Sometimes they are available at great prices or amazing stats.  (In particular -Cap usage and -CPU are both great benefits for this build, the cap buff lets you use more offensive slots instead of battery, and all Praxis builds are tight on CPU)  If you have the CPU for it, I'd consider a Micro Jump Drive instead of the Guidance Computer, but the computer gives you range which sometimes you need for some of the C3 battleships while giving you additional application, and personally I don't have the CPU chops to fit the MJD.  Also you can swap a Ballistic Control System for a Damage Control module for a bit more tank, but I haven't found it necessary for any of the C3 sites.
---
Is he wrong? I mean people have been asking to give you guys money for models for YEARS.
---
I pride myself on consistency
---
The more logical alternative is to only show you in local when you decloak after jumping
---
let nullsec alone. if you want to do localfree things stay in your wormhole.  
---
If you want some content mail me your Staging System. We will bring some content to you... without Local.
---
The HAW Titan nerf is working boys!
---
I tis a waste of time both as an alpha and omega to start as a miner. Never do that!

this is gold

Or you can do 30M per hour running missions or ratting anomalies.
---
love your sun killer , love your typo,  keep at it
---
peace
---
this is an option that I was entertaining, it makes a lot of sense but I assumed that it would get downvoted faster than this proposal, I may have been wrong
---
That was my point.
---
Yes, you can simulate in the Fitting Screen, same as you would a ship.
---
And just like a ship, the Fitting Screen is very bad at accurately reflecting a lot of info.
---
I highly recommend using the program "Pyfa" on your PC. It's a lot better at giving info in a useful fashion. And you can simulate Citadels or ships in there too.
---
Did you add your account to your OG one in the launcher?
---
&gt;Without people buying PLEX with ingame money from other players there would be noone buying PLEX from CCP. So the Rorquals are pretty important to CCP too. More important than people generating c0nTEnT
---
We already have this in Eve though. Granted its shared with ratters doing roughly the same thing, but still. Its called Serenity. Do you think CCP wants TQ to become Serenity or doesn't care if it does or does not slide in this direction too much ?
---
To be fair, while rude he has a point. The models that guy makes are dope and if he was to sell them with CCP approval it would be awesome.
---
Amen. Piracy is about camping and griefing. It is beautiful.
---
1. Search for the Citadel in Market (or surchbar)

2. Klick on the settings button (4 lined icon top left)

3. Press Simulate Structure

I have to say it, I admire Snuffed Out.
---
Tried that.....but i dont see like the stacked multipliers for lets say....blueprint copy service
---
I never had the steam account, I "recruited" my alt with my main.

Former eve player btw

still browse this subreddit some times, saw this in the news recently and couldnt help but notice the uncanny resemblance to eve's ingame wormholes
---
 [https://gfycat.com/candidjitteryborzoi](https://gfycat.com/candidjitteryborzoi)
---
I don't think Eve Online needs a permanent economist, but it sure would be nice to have one take a good look at it once in a while and give them some pointers. Maybe they should just contract one once in a while.
---
Whose entities were involved in snuffing content out there.
---
But then having 2 toons always run off means your reward is always zero. This way means that you will ALWAYS get LP without being locked in to a set time of having to even finish a plex.
---
I made a similar suggestion and it got downvoted to hell lol..
---
My suggestion was something like, the lower the security level the longer the local delay, let’s say below level 5 security the delay would add up to a minute per level, that way you could get content and at the same time avoid system campers..
---
But it is what it is, some don’t like content and killing red triangles is their content.
---
as if we didn't have a thousand of these posts the day it was released though
---
The fact is Eve knew how wormholes looked like before the scientists did, mind blown 🤯😂😂😂
---
TAIWAN NUMBAH WAN!
---
Is this the end for Delve?! Stay tuned!
---
stay in your hole thats your content not owers
---
I wonder if this  [https://twitter.com/CCP\_Peligro/status/1120721631578599426](https://twitter.com/CCP_Peligro/status/1120721631578599426)  is related to the injector prices. Has any of the illgotten plex been sold off to get ISk for these injectors ? Are the people buying the injectors the same or related to the fraud incident ?
---
This is only speculation of course, but I would not be surprised one bit if this turned out to be the case.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
don't worry. the majority here are former eve players :)
---
Am retard.

Can confirm this is how we play.
---
Grindhouse - Trailer? ;)
---
My guess is that VPNs in China are like Western torrent sites. Using them is legally a crime with fairly serious consequences, but as long as you are careful how you use them and don't draw attention to yourself it is unlikely to result in serious consequences.
---
It's a universal rule that law enforcement targets the law breakers with the largest return of political capital per unit of effort. If you keep your head down they'll focus on targets who are easier to catch and/or committing more serious violations, unless political leadership issues orders to specifically target you.
---
Pirate frigs have a few matchups they can lose to pilot error or fit disparity.
---
Garmur: the scram kite version has a fairly narrow margin of error against the dual web kestrel, firetail, or hookbill. The beam tormentor will win a dps race against this fit if he's on mental autopilot and tries to scram kite (he should dive into 500). I've seen slashers and atrons pick up a few kills here for similar reasons, and the dual prop comet/firetail. They can also lose to slicers depending on piloting. The Garmur is by far the easiest pirate frigate to engage, which is probably why it's the most popular - people WILL fight you, because if you fuck up they get a shiny mail.
---
Dramiel: Similar to the Garmur but brawly fits at 500 you can't track exist, so do scram kitey fits for both ACs and Arty. They could have great range control, or could be shield tanked with ridiculous DPS. I'll take these if I'm in a flexible fit like an armor Kestrel or a beam torm, because again - if my opponent fucks up I get a shiny mail.
---
Cruor: These are almost invariably brawly, entirely because they are slow as balls. They will neut the shit out of you so a lot of things get into trouble vs the Cruor. Point kiters, however, can kill it for free, provided they respect the web range. The rare kitey cruor is slower than most kiters and lighter tanked, but point+long web and scorch or beams is very dangerous, and they can neut tacklers off. In general I'll take these with point kiters, cap injected ships, or MSE ships with capless guns like the MSE Kestrel or Slasher.
---
Daredevil, Worm: Fuck no, get the fuck out of my system fun police. This shit just isn't any fun to fight at all.
---
Yes but that's the Parkinson's
---
Pyfa has structures iirc
---
R64 moon mining in a venture was more like 40m an hour the one time i tried it.
---
Having played FW since the beginning (on and off) and been involved in every aspect I feel it is just another aspect of Eve that has always had massive potential but has been poorly developed by CCP game designers and the FW echo chamber of common suggestions.
---
Most CCP designs have been 'low fruit' efforts done to appease, and many player backed changes have resulted in wasted development time (remember the reworks upon reworks? Thanks Ankhet etc..) for very little benefit. Without a real commitment from CCP again and a proper vision of what they are working towards it is just tinkering with the gearbox on a car without an engine.
---
A new vision for FW needs backing from CCP, not pathetic appeasement like "Well we tinkered with Stabs a year ago...And we're checking the results" Sorry Fozzie that line isn't what players want to hear anymore. I'm active and playing again so will chip in to this new FW echo chamber but IMHO not worth the time to set out suggestions or anything bigger until we get a real commitment from CCP.

I actually use an armor Praxis for solo c4 sites. It's got a bit of bling but still comes in cheeper that a rattlesnake fit. Only about 700 mill total for ship and fit.

---
Think I spotted some a while back. few years back we had someone entosis systems with Full Metal Alchemist characters which made me lol.
---
If your a wormholer and you like wormholes then removing local from null and low sec is the last thing you should want because it would make the one thing about wormholes that makes it unique and turn it into just another bit of space, nothing special about it at all, maybe just its lack of normal gate.
---
Peace and respect o7
---
&gt;just buy plex
---
Did this recently having had a couple of billion sitting in my wallet with nothing I wanted to buy. At least it'll take me a few clicks longer to waste it that way.
---
looks like tri and snuffed are having an awesome time right now.
---
The boy doesn't want to bring Chinese lunch to school. Instead he wants Lunchables, in order to get accepted by the white kids.
---
Kinetic yields best averages but it gets overtaken in different weather effects and vs different targets. There is no best damage type due to spawn variance although, as a general rule of thumb, kinetic does very well in exotic filaments, explosive in gamma, EMP in electrical, and thermal in fire.
---
Dark filaments do not have a damage type bonus, so it all comes down to spawn variance. As default I like to carry kinetic and thermal missiles. Your damage type will be different for each spawn.
---
did you read the entire post? I don't want to remove local, local is useful (in some cases, a bit too useful) I just want to delay it a bit and add a bit of variety to more sections of space.
---
Sorry, I didn’t get your point.. Are you saying it’s a bad investment or something else?
---
I’ve never bought plex or looked into it as the return seems too low for me..
---
It's not piracy per say... But if the life of a duly licensed privateer can appeal to you, DnG is recruiting. We do faction warfare for the amarr empire and shoot at basically everyone that is not amarr. It's kinda like piracy in that regard but you earn LP for it so there's a bit of a cash flow.
---
People don't like them because everyone tries to shield tank them like a rattlesnake but the ship lacks the cpu needed for a shield fit. But they are actually god mode if you go armor tank. It opens up the cpu a bit and gives you ALL the mids for capacitor fitting, tackle and damage application.
---
I use a cruise missile, armor Praxis for soloing c4 sites. It's a very strong ship.
---
Wormholers trying to force their shit on us.
---
Go away.
---
I was refering to someone making a QQ post about 8 rorquals recalling drones on the same server tick, like alt-tabbing through 8 clients within a server tick was impossible.
---
When did the Thrasher midslots get reduced from 3 to 2?  Couldn't find it on Google.
---
Local is not the one thing that make them unique, the labor of navigation and the dynamic connections is the greater differentiating trait.
---
yes... maybe fuel few jumps, but not that many, even if you fill everything with LO... And we both know, how fast a few forget the fuel, leave take the wrong, and then how fast a market is sucked dry if the command comes: "Fill up everything with LO"
---
Currently an unfitted Aeon for a max range (5 ly) gate needs:
---
about 10 000 m3 in LO, costing around 5.5 mio at the current price of 200 isk / LO. I doubt it would stay this low if they could use JGates.
---
So ye, in theory you could move a whole super fleet around 5 ansiblex jump gates, but that only works if prepared. also you can still waterboard them, just at less possible places. If it happens at a moments notice, I doubt anyone (except maybe goons) have that much LO ready seeded on the market to fuel a whole super fleet for 5 gates. (Ignoring the other support caps, titans etc that would have to move with them).
---
100 supers for 5 jumpgates, would cost around 2.5bn just in fuel. And not even a single ship lost. 
---
The moving goon swarm of 500 titans, 500 supers, faxes etc would probably exceed the value of multiple titans. And require tens of JFs worth of LO PER GATE. Honestly, I want to see this...
---
I like it, null-sec should not have the same infrastructure in place as empire space, just like standing fleets it’ll be built up by groups that want and can afford it.
---
t r i a n g l e s
---
I use a Praxis for level 4 missions myself, and I love it. I have a mixed laser + drone boat that allows me to complete the missions easily (I just switch to my Abaddon if I need to snipe).
---
That's still way better than the current system, where most of the time you can sit in a plex in a quiet system and complete it undisturbed, and most of the remaining time, you waste a pvp'er's time a little until they leave, and then come back to  complete your site. 
---
However: I said, "half." Make it a quarter! Give the insta-lp mechanic a fatigue where doing it too often has diminishing returns. Give it a character specific fatigue where stealing from the same few characters has diminishing results (while still destroying their progress).
---
`before I get downvoted into Oblivion`
---
🤔
---
`wormholer btw` 
---
🤦
---
this is what I was getting at, the scaling cost hopefully would keep the system from killing off the small guy more than null-sec already has.
---
I am hoping that if CCP were to take this idea and mutate it into something useful, they keep that spirit in a final idea.
---
I couldn't just post a half-assed game mechanic without taking the time to farm some salt. efficiency in all things is Eve's subtitle after all.
---
nerf local, ratting in null isn't worth the hassle so i go and earn isk somewhere else, you still don't get content.
---
&gt;This one was an interesting idea, however it would screw with tactics such as going deep into enemy territory, setting up a staging, and lying siege to a backend system for some kind of tactical situation.
---
That soudns so radically different than the FW I know that it's hard to even imagine.  It sounds like a fun narative however.
---
I even went as far as put a ticket in to ask if that wasn’t permitted and the response was just a referral to the Refer-a-friend program.  I took that to be a green light to use the links to make new alts.  
---
I probably would avoid abusing it tho...
---
That is why the recommendation has a system for removing the delay, if you want to rat, you pay a tax to keep local updating like highsec. Or you pack a cyno and use those capital umbrellas.
---
The system is not designed to kill null sec krabbing, it is designed to allow hunters to get down the pipe or further into enemy space without being perfectly tracked with just system sitting alts
---
Is that Hardin from CVA? Good bloke if the same fella. Oh and hi S8 too. o/
---
So I am curious how does Vince handle it? Does he just shoot slow people?
---
This post is a little too high effort for my liking.
---
"Your damage type will be different for each spawn"  This is exactly the explanation that I have found all over the place and is what I'm looking for clarification on.
---
I'm trying to figure out what damage type to use for those different spawns.  We know that sleepers, drifters, trigs, etc can spawn.  So figuring out what damage type to fire at each of them is my goal to figure out.
---
Thanks!
---
You can still mine in places where there are no cynos allowed. You know... wormholes or... highsec locations. 
---
If there are cynos allowed, you will always be able to defend your mining fleet or even bait them into ganking and fuck them with your fleet on standby. They will probably lose interest if they know you have backup?
---
Its up to you. Try to create some content for you.
---
Do dead co ever win? Every AAR and BR I see them on is a comedic catalogue of errors.
---
I like being able to attack something and take down local.
---
😂
---
An Aeon can carry 360,000 m^3 of ozone using just it's ship hangar so 10,000 m^3 per jump is nothing...
---
we're doing it again, not saying a date though... also this was just as much fun for CCP as it was for the players... i find it important to remember to have a little fun
---
That is a fringe interaction that I could see being used more in FW lowsec than anywhere else.
---
would be nice to see how FCs use/abuse a system like this to wage wars
---
Try polarized neutron blasters, Ogre IIs, 3x MFS and 3X Drone Dmg mods... beastly DPS if you're ganking smaller stuff, and still bags of CPU left to fit other fun stuff like webs and a TP.
---
Id be interested in seeing an armor variation too if you have the fitting string handy
---
Ive been mostly doing c3 wh sites, how does the l4 mission isk compare
---
wow even without the meme'ing it still feels applicable to EVE.
---
Can i see that fit?

If you are looking to just run C3 sites you can downgrade of lot of the bling to T2.

All I read was rum, rum, rum, rum, rum and rum.

How long does it take to do 1 mission?  Also id imagine some of the decreased isk/hr is compensated for by the far easier acess to trade hubs and much lower gank risk
---
I recommend Captain Morgan's Original Spiced.

You can’t dock but if you anchor an XL SMA you can store it in there. It will drop in the wreck if someone blows your POS up though

It actually was a thing before Upwells when station systems mattered.

Yeah. You need it in the c4 sites to deal with the heavy neuting. Once the the neuting ships die I refit more damage and application.

Morgan Freeman is really really good at saying things. He makes a living out of it and many people enjoy his work. It might not even be a bad idea to pay Mr. Freeman a fair chunk of cash for saying just those 4 words on their blog about it, if you could book him to do that. Art!

I dont doubt its a thing. I just think the assumption that it is a thing is the oddest part. I've never thought of it.

In most jurisdictions in the US unknowingly purchasing stolen goods isn't even a crime. Getting perma banned for it without knowing if the person who bought it even knew they were doing something wrong is pretty draconian.

Happened to me last night on my 200m VNI. There was nothing around me -- I zoomed in all the way at highest settings. I got stuck in space, couldn't jump, and now getting blasted by rockets sitting at 0.0m/s. Canceling warp did nothing, because I could no-longer move.

Thanks CCP.

A good income source is unironically abyssal deadspace. 3 hawks can farm t4 and t5 sites for around 2 to 300 mill an hour. More if the loot gods shine on you. It fits in with the frigate pvp skills as well so it's not too much of a deviation like a Gila would be. It's a nice addition to looting or in place of looting in the beginning when you die a lot. 
---
Plus if you want to fly trig ships, you might be lucky to farm the skill books and bpcs/mats yourself.

---
As a short term investment its not a great deal I don't think, but if you have isk sitting about for a few months or more then plex seems a reasonable place to put it as its been increasing in price for years.
---
By principle a new comers aren't going to understand what's the margin of engagement of frigates to know the (already thin) margin of engagement against pirate frigates. Not taking into account the fact that many of those fly with implants and/or boosts and most likely better skills. It will be a lot less frustrating to just avoid pirate frigates. I have 40M SP (3 yo player) and I avoid them if I can find T1 frigates to fight mine.
---
Yes! It is :)  
---
Sorry I forgot to explain it lol
---
I hide sigs so it is easy to spot a new k162 pop up. Works for me.

No it is not worth it. CCP did that on purpose to prevent people from afk mining a crap load of alphas in HS in order to plex.
---
Thanks for all the replies, if im being completely honest i was expecting a lot of answers that were just like 'its a noob ship git gud". Nice to get the pvp perspective, i dont do much pvp
---
never warp to 0
---
&gt; This tells me you're somewhat lacking in imagination.
---
Sounds to me like you are lacking in experience. Afk cloaking is a solution. I am not saying its an ideal solution. But for another solution that'd work in the same way, you'd have to give up the current local as it is. But you see, if you current local up afk camping stops being a problem even for you because the very moment a camper is a problem is when you see it in local.
---
So what you offer is removal of a solution without offering an alternative. And even if you did, it would probably invalidate afk camping as a problem.
---
&gt; There are lots of non-bot farmers in subs. Are they a "problem" in Eve?
---
Yes. Unchecked non-bot farming is still a macroeconomical problem for Eve. It's why CCP keeps doing yield nerfs to Rorquals etc.
---
Yeah fair enough. I'm around 50m SP, and I'll generally take the gamble because you never know. The burden is on them to do everything correctly, and if they don't, I win. :)

To add to what the other poster said, they're specifically leaving serenity because it's virtually dead from rampant RMT and botting. As the largest alliance of that particular server, I'll let you decide how much responsibility they bear for that.
---
Oh right, yeah I should of added that to my original post.. But what I was trying to say is the Eve economy is kind of like real life and plex is the gold of New Eden haha, having isk sitting around in large quantity is just a waste really..
---
&gt; The "warfare" part of FW seems to be as manipulated by giant blocs and supercapitals
---
????
---
Huh. Thanks for that, I have a newbie currently coming into Brand Newbros asking about more interesting ways to make isk. I've suggested exploration, because that's how I made my first billion fairly quickly (that and ninja looting PL battlefields lol) but this is another excellent idea that is only helped by developing fundamental skills.

---
don't forget mass limits and NO SUPERS
---
So if you can just spend your way out of it with the taxes, what's even the point? It makes large groups have an even larger advantage. We already spend hundreds of billions of ISK a month on fuel. What's another couple hundred?

Then time for you to stop talking like I am Minerva when you have no clue who I am.

you are not given the choice. Accels gates warp you to 0.

and if we come up with a better system to stop you,you want the game changed to give you an advantage again... If you want to get to people fast use wormholes its already an effective way to make it down pipes without being seen on intel channels

that's not an unpopular opinion, that's the base opinion. What eloween probably means by "killing fw" is killing the cal/gal wz(which was the last really active one) and related to the ties that galmil had with snuff giving them for a time unilateral escalation potential in the region. They did break all ties to galmil however after rdraw left fw it seems.

Pretty much just like the praxis. A gift for some anniversary or something, gave out 5(i think?) To every account active at the time, which was before alphas so there were less accounts. They also used to be medium drones instead of heavies.

I have seen an ihub bash escalate like twice in the year I was in fw(last year pretty much in gal/cal), granted I wasn't the most involved basher but still, wasn't common. The control of systems was decided by the citadels, that's where shit would escalate.
---
Incursions, missions, DED sites, relic sites, etc
---
A change to local is good only if it diminishes nullsec's safety a little. The problem with nullsec's safety is that it's enjoyed by the most organized regions. One really big problem in Eve is how everyone is moving to these most organized regions (instead of joining less organized regions or carving their own space) and how there is no other meaningful option. Any proposal to modify local in a way that'd leave the access to the current local behind an infrastructure wall doesn't address the actual problem. It just creates more reasons for people to join heavily guarded umbrella space.
---
Cool, learn something new every day
---
They have a perfectly legit option that benefits developers and the game. They chose to give money to people ruining the game. They deserve every punishment they get and more.
---
TY
---
Yep. Any non-hidden sig will show up.
---
The idea is that the cost would scale such that removing the effect over all systems that a coalition controls would be infeasible, while packing all the miners and ratters into 1 system would spike the costs even more. I don't have the data required to suggest a completely balanced system but I am sure that one can be found.
---
Do you have an omega alt account?
---
Start wintrading in FW for maximum LP market abuse
---
wouldent be so bad if they added something interesting like a mechanic people could work with. imagine structures for collecting the intel of local. A small structure near every gate that logs entries into systems and populates local so you can destroy them to mess up reporting. They could be cheap and destructable if they dont detect you after 25 seconds or so you pop up on local anyway so you get a delay for those that want it, but they have to work for that delay. It also gives a method for the big entities to keep local working by placing these structures could have small ones and huge ones for entire system each with its respective costs
---
I have seen camp a bubble with a Gnosis. Usually a medium T2 bubble. Set it up in a pipe system. Use http://evemaps.dotlan.net/ to check jumps. You should be able to pack everything you need in the Gnosis. If you have an alt to scout the outgoing and incoming gates that will help.

and i'd go anywhere else, because it'd be better isk:effort:reward

Does anyone have any isk/hr calculations and fits for running C4’s in a wolf rayet? Is it comparable to C5’s in any way? I do stuff in my rattlesnake but was wondering if it’s worth my time or not thanks

or just not leave safer areas of space that offer comparable income.

---
I run the Guristas, Angel and Amarr arcs, and it took me ages to find info on how to get into them. How does one get into the Gallente one?
---
Yes, but at least 2 of those still make you a hunt able target, and none of them can be done AFK in a VNI.
---
Yeah, citadel warfare is a big part of it. I think after I left FW I tried to forget what citadels did to the shape of it lol.
---
I dont think there is, you've just got to do the math yourself.
---
Would you recommend a cheaper fit to "practice" doing that web kiting thing? I'm still trying to get better at manual piloting kiting, and clearly that is required to make this fit work effectively, thanks.
---
&gt; I don't have the data required to suggest a completely balanced system but I am sure that one can be found.
---
considering nobody has in over 15 years, i think you might be mistaken.
---
Nah, fuck off and stay in your wormhole if you want gameplay like that.
---
Cheers!
---
The fact that no-one has died in Delve in 18 months until this guy, despite a lot of ratters being dozy and/or AFK, shows just how ridiculous the current umbrella is.
---
What range are you getting on the baddon?
---
I made a new acct the other day to start training up a new combat alt and used the referral.
---
I think it's intentionally ambiguous because they probably want to go after people abusing the system by making tons and tons of alts.  But if you legitimately refer 1-2 alt accounts, I would imagine CCP would be happy, especially if they became omega clones at some point.
---
All of the good rewards only kick in when the referred account becomes omega or the account buys plex through eve-o, so unless you're purposely abusing that part of the system, I don't think they'll care.
---
Wait this need to be updated osmium is rip

I want to but damn that skillbook is expensive
---
I've been playing this game since release, so don't presume to tell me I lack experience.  And the idea a camper is a problem is only when you see it in local makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Without local you would presume there's always a camper present.  In every single system.
---
don't forget that around 2011, the titan price was \~35b
---
yeh, I tried to come up with an idea that would attempt to strike a balance between the ability for a large coalition to protect its members while allow the little guy to keep on working without hitting them too hard, I believe the cost scaling can be worked so that it accomplishes this goal. I also am operating under the assumption that a blanket nerf to local without a solution to work with it would hit the little guy far too hard and possibly kill them off.
---
I want the system to not be too cost prohibitive to keep local unaffected in a single system or a small number of systems, but I want it to be incredibly cost prohibitive to keep an entire region safe.
---
I would like a system that would not be tied to a cost based system, but at the moment, I cannot think of a way to do this without killing the small guy in the process
---
Or we'd just eat the cost.
---
Cuz meta

Speaking of T3D, CCP would probably better off just delete Confessor
---
Why not? He's doing God's work eliminating the weak and the botters.
---
It's annoyingly slow so there's no way you can do anything except sit at 0 and facetank, which I find to be boring gameplay.
---
It's also not really that cheap when you take into account insurance, though certainly it is cheaper than faction battleships.
---
They're great brick tanking bait ships though (like the gnosis).
---

Please tell me you’re trolling.
---
&gt;I realise that you have some strong opinions on the subject, and you certainly have a valid point, however I personally quite like the skill training system because it rewards dedication and patience.
---
I do. And in that case, you do you then; I don't think we're really going to reconcile on the subject. I love the idea of this game, but of the nearly dozen friends I've introduced to EVE, one third quit because of the combat and two thirds quit because of the skill system (with one exception, who stuck around for a few years). 
---
&gt; Not much effort involved in buying skill injectors really, is there?
---
If you're grinding isk for them, there absolutely is. That's a pretty enormous effort from the perspective of a new player.
---
Don't do it. Mining is boring, and low yield to boot when you're an alpha. Why do you think you want to get into mining?
---
The only thing that is probably worth it is ninja gas harvesting in wormholes.
---
Lowsec is explicitly in faction space, friend. Gate guns hit hard, too.
---
That was amazing
---
Give it some time lmao. 
---
People have huge stockpiles of ore that need to be first dumped. Way more rorqs need to die and excavators for there to really be an effect. Give it a few months, then see again.

Jita is a very poor place to track the price of minerals. If it was reliable at all, we wouldn't be outproducing everyone with our local minerals.

---

---
The economist, Dr Eyo, was actually part of a team at CCP that looked at the economy.  The CSM (6 and 7 at least) got to meet with them during every summit, and we'd get a d0pe presentation with shitloads of graphs.  I haven't been on the CSM for some time, but I'm reasonably sure EVE still has an internal Economic Council that does the exact same thing.
---
Because injectors prices weren't keeping up during the rapid plex price growth.
---
Any kiting works as practice. 'web kiting' isn't like an official term, with this fitting you just happen to need to stay within 21k (25k with navy missiles), which incidentally is the same as your heated web range with FN webs.

You just turn on the webs when something threatens to come too close - just like with any other defensive web. Easier said than done of course.

&gt;who the fuck wants to spend half a work week's worth of time just for one PLEX?
---
Just shooting from the hip:
---
* Unemployed folk (EG Maybe they are disabled but can play Eve?)
---
* Employed folk who don't earn enough to pay a 15$ sub
---
* Players interested in running multiple accounts without destroying their in game or out of game wallets (Time is money as you pointed out, and this doesn't always translate to botting)
---
* Players interested in using MCTs (not always skill farms!)
---
* Players trying to lower their subscription cost (maybe they can't afford 15/mo but they can use some of their omega isk earned to supplement and make it more like a 5 or 10$/mo sub)  
---
Most players I know (current and since un-subbed)  fit into one or more of these categories, and the rest can afford the sub(s) and generally don't seem to care about PLEX value.  
---
Not all of them play 20+ hours a week (or have time to), but most of them get at least that much time in per month.  
---
I do know a very few unemployed folk who are on seemingly 16-18hrs a day constantly but they are not particularly complaining either (because they have lots of time, high isk cost sub is more of an inconvenience, and they are so stupid rich in game from having that much time to play it really isn't an issue it seems).  
---
I would wager the most hurt players by high plex prices are those with jobs that simply don't have the extra time or money to blow on a MMO sub. These players not only wouldn't want to spend the 20 hours a month farming plex, but if they did, they wouldn't have anything left to be competitive with (EG spend on things like ships and losses or investments) which is almost as discouraging as being stuck as an alpha... but they'll still do it, until one day you stop seeing them log in (seen it!).

Thanks, will do.

---
You're going to have to do better than that, friend.
---
First you should wait a few months. Macroeconomic trends take a while to settle.
---
Or you could look at excavator price history, query Zkill for drones destroyed, and calculate operating cost trends.
---
I'd recommend using mineral prices instead of compressed ore, but I'm unsure which is truly higher volume.  However, you probably should check nullsec market prices. Might find interesting trends across alliances.
---
They should have never made it possible to gather all of the ore you needed from a single security space. High, Low, and Null should have exclusive ores that have a high yield of particular minerals and only small yields from other ores. That would make it so you had to gather from those areas or buy them, which means more ore moving in the markets. 
---
As it is you can drop Rorqs in null and just hoover up everything you need. That was a bad design decision on their part. Completely short-sighted.
---
Bastion only lasts a minute, it is rare you'll lose more than a few seconds by using it for the massive range/tank buff. Plus, the EWAR immunity makes it worth using bastion most of the time anyway.
---
What /u/Mauti404 said applies 100%. That said, gas mining is a pretty good option. It's different to regular mining that there are only 2 ships that do it and both mine at the same speed. The only difference is in the TI or TII (omega only) harvesters which are 50% faster (plus some extra skills). Considering all the other difficulties involved with gas mining it's actually far less of a difference in practical terms.
---
Good gas sites spawn in wormholes, null, and lowsec, but only in certain regions. I would consider that and join a group local to where you want to mine.
---
I like it so that if no one is in the capture range (that is in FW) the counter just resets right away. That way you can just force them to warp off with only a few secs left and then move onto the next site. That way they have wasted all that time for not staying and fighting for it.
---

also jita prices for ore/minerals aren't necessarily a good metric, check the mining MER data

Pretty sure they used to do that for regular ore, [cerlestes](https://ore.cerlestes.de) still shows regional indicators for ore and ice.
---
And they used to do that for moon ores, IIRC NC. or PL had a monopoly on technetium for a while.  CCP eventually enacted antitrust measures and put an end to it, but there's much more of the story than I remember.
---
Anyway, aside from ice, CCP doesn't seem to be in favor of region-locking minerals. (Wonder when ice will globalize...)

He went to considerable lengths to protect himself being banned directly for 'Bonus Room' activities, but as one is always reminded in cases of this sort, Capone was actually sent down for tax evasion.
---
Kinetic is not the best, it is best overall average and a lot of Caldari Hulls + worm and gila get kinetic bonus. With the bonus and it being secondary damage type so often it often surpasses even dedicated weather effect DPS or individual target holes DPS or is enough on par with it to simply not make any big practical difference. Thus making it a good overall choice if you don't want or can't have more then 2 damage types.
---

So you can make 6 Jumps then you gotta refill (and someone needs to move the new LO to where you need it)
---
You made a point, and it was a fine point. Legally speaking, you’re on point.
---
I stick to the good old fashioned "lol", thanks.
---
It varies depending on the difficulty, but usually an average of about 30 minutes to an hour. For missions like The Assault, Worlds Collide, and Angel Extravaganza, it can take even longer.
---
In activities like abyssal deadspace there is often a "meta" comp that is worked out fairly quickly. 
---
I haven't done abyssal or played this godforsaken game in ages, so if someone better qualified comes along feel free to disregard this.
---
I don't think blasters will be too useful here as abyss ships tend to have variable ranges so you want to bring something that can handle every scenario, lest you be stuck with a 2km optimal while getting railed at 20km by a kiting ship.
---
Hawks are missile spec; the only thing that matters (in pve) for small missile ships is if the missile can actually hit or not (you don't run into sig damage reduction until bigger sizes) and the Hawk is bonused for range with the AF skill bonus which helps a lot.
---
t4/t5 is an endgame activity that requires you to risk a considerable amount of ISK, however, doing it in a team is a good way of bringing cheaper ships and spreading that risk around; but it does lower your rewards too.
---
Set your safety to red and shoot at everything that moves
---
word is wormholes already do this
---
So I go in with 2 toons and then I get a completely safe plex with an improved LP payout?
---
Asian Jim?
---
Wormholes don't have local, I don't want to remove local from null, just change the rate at which players appear in the list.
---
Some reading material, its thick. My 2 cents, choose role, choose a frigate, go loose them(note plural), repeat  
---
 [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z7dkJrFiKZo4w\_xVgJSmWCUyvKQ8Ha8Q/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z7dkJrFiKZo4w_xVgJSmWCUyvKQ8Ha8Q/view)
---
It's also one of the best ways to ensure that lowsec/null groups can camp FW all day getting easy kills as all the noobs learning pvp are bottlenecked into a guaranteed list of systems.
---
It's not a good idea. Perhaps you could give a bonus/malus to system flipping rate or a bonus to LP gain depending on how many allied/enemy systems are adjacent instead? I feel that would be a good compromise
---
where else can you teleport the largest fleet in the game to you instantly for free?
---
With no local? sure i'll catch them, pretty easily too.
---
I don't see a reason to implement it outside of sovnull, tbh, but making the null empires upkeep local makes sense, and again, incentivises holding smaller regions. I mean I guess you could end up with something like Fortress UW9B again in Curse, but we worked pretty hard for that and L4 runners still got in trouble pretty often.
---
The problem is, you'll have gateway systems paid down to 0 local delay and intel monitoring happening there (almost guaranteed by bots lol) and gangs that bust past them down the pipe are known and the bots all go tether up. Boredom continues.
---
Removing local entirely doesn't work very well compared to jspace because you can't crit or close all your outgates before you  start krabbing lol. The mass mechanic is a different means of security, much like local. If someone jumps your crit and collapses it, or a wandering hole appears, you'll see it on probe scan. You know somebody's with you; possibly faster than dscan, even if you don't have other scouts.
---
Having a "gate activity detected" message instead could work, since you don't know if it's friendly or not. Much like in a wh you don't know if it's some noob in an imicus or if that new wandering hole just puked a bunch of trouble into your system. At that point the question is "how much of local do you want to remove?"
---
The problem isn't the isk/hr. The problem isn't the afkness. The problem is that you can do these things without any risk of people coming and creating content. When roaming ceptor gangs had more of a chance of bagging the odd Domi or VNI, more of them would be out in space, people would get out and try to paint them into a corner and blap them with instalockers, etc. The ceptors might in turn set a logoff trap. It became a game of high mobility covert warfare. 
---
Null needs to be able to make isk in relative safety. Alliance line members need cash. They need to be able to train combat skills at the same time, so combat sites of some kind need to be relevant to income.
---
It's not an easy solution, because most "fixes" decrease the income or add opportunity costs rather than simply give attackers more opportunities to gank ratters and force a standing fleet response.
---
Even with no intel channel, the success rate of shotgun fleets is very low. You're well below 0.1 kills/jump in enemy ratting space. Logoff trapping wasn't much better unless you had a spy alt dscanning for you. Most of the time a reasonably well positioned ratter paying one bit of attention is going to be able to warp off. They might get tackled and drop EC drones or counter tackle. Or they might be bait fit and murder the shit out of you.
---
This kind of large scale coordination is the bane of every CCP attempt to break up null. No matter what else, there is safety in numbers through your intel channel and your counter-drop fleets.
---
I'm all for figuring out more incentives to allow both gankers and small null corps to have more success. It's just very hard, because how the fuck do you nerf the value of information?
---
Last time I did that I was clowning around with a 10mn AB on my imp for max speed and didn't notice that I burned out the shield extender from overheating until the next time I took a fight (this time sober) and wondered why I was dying so fast
---
where else do you even need to waste other people's time like that? oh right, nowhere.
---
Inteesting topic. But you also learned of the existance of that carrier due to local chat.
---
You also knew he had no backup or cloaky dictors around him because he was solo in local chat.
---
Works both ways, you see.
---
Another quality meme.
---
What the fuck r/eve
---
Blaster baiting is always fun. I used to "belt rat" in catch all the time in a vexor. Scram, web, sebo, and like 600-700 dps. :P
---
What movie is this from?
---
All you have to do is make them bleed, and people stop believing in them
---
I get good fights pretty often, the trick is being engageable. People wont' take fights they know they're going to lose. It sounds like you're That Guy boating around in a Worm and bitching he's getting no fights.
---
Since you're new to capital mechanics, you can place DSTs full of fuel, ammo, LO or stront in your ship bay.
---
Wasnt Sib Squad joining Fire coalition? Or did that end up not happening
---
tldr "go reffo all this guy's stuff during GoT".
---
And the replacement was the white dreads :sadface: I want my glorious long hair back
---
that would have been an embarrassing killmail
---
If i see right there are only a part of DeadCo on the report Darkness and Slyce are missing
---
U fly Loki Sabre Hurricane and Hound?
---
Then you good
---
From what I've been told they decided to remain in GotG. Considering FI.RE's current status, I think they made the right call :thinking:
---
I like this but I would prefer all citadels to just enforce the same docking as stations.  It seems like a pretty simple fix, have concord "force" an ACL on all structures in FW systems where the rival factions can't dock or operate the citadel.
---
all these stories of fun shit make me really nostalgic for old eve, but then I come to reality and realize it's all about super proliferation now
---
I wouldn't say I'm alone. 
---
In fact, I didn't have much to do with this kill except having dreads when called. In fact the diversity in our killmails is amazing. Once we bring people together and handle logistics like ship distribution, the way how people take initiative and the thing grows has been something to see.
---
While I agree I haven't seen them win yet, I wouldn't say their defeat today was due to comedic errors. They put up a good fight, didn't lose their mainline ships and had us logistics pilots working to earn our keep. It was a good, hard fought battle and they only truly lost the objective.
---
Formerly, I have traveled far in New Eden only to end up in Snuffed Out ^^
---
Dirt 'n' Glitter
---
I fully acknowledge and accept that fact, and finding something worth killing does not require local, dotlan's NPC bounty metric works wonders for at a glance hunting intel.
---
the local delay is intended to only work one way, I would know when I jump in how many people are in local (or have been in local for &gt; the delay) but they would not see me until the delay runs out.
---
it does indeed still work both ways, under this scenario I would have little to no idea if you blops a bomber fleet or black ops battleships into system when I tackled your super.
---
If you can fly a muninn you can join origin
---
I don't find it ambiguous at all.  The purpose of the recruit-a-friend program is for players to invite **new players** into EVE, not to build up your alt empire.  People use it for their alts all the time, and you're probably not going to get in trouble for it, but that doesn't change the text or intent.  It's right in the Terms and Conditions at  [https://www.eveonline.com/recruit](https://www.eveonline.com/recruit) 
---
 *The Recruitment Program is intended to encourage players to invite new players to join EVE Online. Violating the purpose of the Recruitment Program in any way or form is prohibited. Abusing the Recruitment Program is considered an exploit and will not be tolerated. Violations of this rule will be handled by EVE Online Customer Support, and action will be taken against players who violate this rule, including, but not limited to: warnings or bans of the offending accounts and confiscation of ISK and other items.* 
---
If you like the game and keep playing, the time savings and isk value of the rewards will quickly become negligible.  Fly safe (but not too safe).
---
do they do null stuff? i normally see them in the FW area.
---
With a delay on local camping relics doesn't get any easier, and even if you managed to probe down a DED site runner before showing up he'd almost certainly see your probes on dscan.
---
Not in Delve
---
Recruiting video definitely doesn't ft here I'd say...
---
Cool video indeed
---
No he very chill as long as he dont get fucked up enough. But when he rages for fleetnumbers you better not be rorqing... this could lead you to get killed.
---
But normaly you can see the ragelvl in discord or pingchannel. So at least you are warned
---
&gt;Generally speaking what is the better level 4 mission ship out of these 2 ships? i have the skills to fly both to a good degree but im just wondering if the pricetag (and the fact it makes me a target for ganks) is worth it or not. is it faster than the domi? can it do things the domi cant?  
---
&gt;fits and suggestions welcome!
---
Neither. Gila or a Mach or Rattler. Both Domi and Kronos will slow you down incredibly and some missions are a PITA due to their limitations. Their slowness will make it extremely boring to a point where you'll start AFKing or burn out on it.
---
If you want L4s to be of some actual play value, do them in a cruiser, Gila, Loki, Tengu, Vedmak, Ishtar, Munin etc. The farm isn't bad in them either, since while they take longer on full clears of the large missions, the majority of the missions are not the large ones, they are mid / small size and on this is where they surpass all battleships, even Machs, because of the travel times etc. So they come out slightly ahead when you average it all out.
---
Battleships on the other hand do the harder content much easier like the L4 epic arcs etc. You will need to heavily bling and whatnot, but you can do them in a single ship, no alts, no dual boxing required. And naturally, battleships are more suited for AFK and botting of regular L4s then cruisers which require a lot of active gameplay.
---
as u/Liraal stated, a local delay would make catching bot VNIs relatively easy as they would not know you were there until they see you on Dscan. 
---
and before you say "ill just put a bot on the gate to watch for a flash" image detection on that scale and with that accuracy is incredibly hard, still I am sure someone would do it. Even with an image detection bot on the gate, wormholes would become very effective in catching bots due to the random nature, one lucky roll of a static and BOOM all of your bots are dead.
---
I see. Well my girlfriend will be using the alt account when she's on so we can play together so I did actually recruit her in that sense, even though I'll be using it most the time. Since it's only two accounts I highly doubt I'll draw too much attention. Thanks though, didnt see that in the TOC for some reason.
---
CHINA CHINA NUMBER 1
---
Have you seen the killboards for c5 and c6 wh space. its the safest bear space in the game.
---
So you just refit with a mobile depot?
---
AC Mach, I used that all the time. 
---
Drop a Can, orbit @10 with AB on, and blast everything within 80km.
---
Pesky frigs that goes under your tracking can be killed with the drones.
---
I ran it with 3 gyro 2 tracking a nano and a DCU.
---
Nowadays with only 6 low slots, swap a tracking enhancer with a tracking computer
---
from 30km and up a Rail Kronos with Faction AM out damages a blaster Kronos with Null and it can do that without being forced in to Bastion. So it can keep moving towards the gate or mission target, wasting less time. Most lvl 4 npc are outside 30km. 
---
You can CHOOSE to go in to Bastion if tanking or Ewar requires it but you're not FORCED to JUST because you want to apply any decent dps. Paper dps is fairly meaningless.
---
That guy definitely doesn't play EVE neither have any actual influence over balancing the game
---
No, it's not doable. At least I haven't found a way to do it non hawk. The method is to use the dark filaments. The dark environment gives you more speed and halves the turret optimal range allowing you to kite the enemies. 
---
The hawk has amazing missile range and can go fast enough that the only real problems come up when you orbit too close on the high tracking spawns (lucid cruisers) or get caught with web + scram + neut. A blaster boat would not even have enough range to hit the rats if you were sitting at 0 on them. 
---
T1 and t2 can probably be done in kestrels eith light missiles but the isk per hour goes down and your only real isk would come from the rare high value skill book drop.
---
you should only use kinetic if  your in an exotic abyssal. tessella ships are weak and have more shield HP points or equal to armor hp points, with a bigger thermal hole than kinetic armor (20% thermal shield hole vs 10% kinetic armor hole so thermal is the better choice). all of the big ships with massive hit points are either omni resist or have a thermal hole, not a kinetic hole. if you are fighting overmind drone ships, thermal will kill them faster not kinetic. if you are fighting any damaviks, vedmaks, or lekshaks, thermal will kill them faster. the google doc spreadsheet proves this. there is no ship on that spreadsheet AT ALL where kinetic will kill it faster than thermal. This kinetic is best rumor needs to die. Thermal is the best to use period, not kinetic. esp with a gila or a worm. 
---
all things being equal, a thermal gila will chew through ships faster than kinetic gila, unless you are in an exotic abyssal site, then kinetic damage clearly wins. 
---
so again your information is incorrect. the worm and gila also get the same thermal bonus as kinetic.
---
Literally every single one of [Dreddit](https://dredditisrecruiting.com/) doctines use the Stiletto as an instalocker and a Sabre as a bubbler. A lot of our doctrines use Minmitar ships since we use a lot of shield tanked ships. We also do a shit ton of PVP against Fraternity. Message me if you have any questions! You can apply at the link above.

Destiny will get destroyed in this debate.
---
D E L T E T E L O C A L
---
Ill make a trade fam no local in nulllsec but supers can be cynoed into whs.
---
It definitely went up, A LOT
---
People say there was (and sometimes still say) no inflation because the cost of most goods didn't go up. In fact in some cases they went down. But that's not because isk deflated, it was because they made things much easier to get. Back in the day you had to bust your ass to make stuff, especially in 0.0 you'd have to take your ore to a refinery station, then like 10ish jumps to a factory, and all using a regular industrial with no cloaks or anything.
---
So yeah a cruiser is around the same price or even cheaper then it was even in the old days, t2 stuff is cheaper, as well, however when you look at things that haven't been made easier to get, or something like plex (or rl value of isk) and see how insanely it's inflated.
---
Seriously I'm not joking when I say at one point isk was like $2.00 per m on exchange sites, now it's closer to $2 per bil :P
---
the pocket control argument is a valid and compelling one. One one hand, you can secure your staging and a few of your most important/profitable pockets and on the other hand, that puts most if not all of your members in one place, and with the scaling properties of the proposal, this would make securing that system very expensive and/or massively cut into your profits/available isk.
---
As the secured space becomes more and more crowded, people will start to move out to find more isk, putting them in more danger.
---
I dont want to remove much of local, I simple want to tweak in immediate nature of it. I want this to foster a more competitive interaction between the hunters and the hunted, at the moment, the hunted have won that race with the intel channel. All other ways to avoid hunters can be mitigated by the hunter changing tactics. The intel channel cannot be avoided without considerable luck.
---
You can't fight other groups. The pvp arena is only for cruisers. The trio hawk in dark sites is dank isk but highly loot dependent. The single most valuable items I have by the end of running say 10 to 15 sites is the red loot you sell to, just like sleeper loot. 
---
I occasionally get skill books that are high value and can usually get an unstable mutaplasmid worth 50 to 100 mill every two to three runs at least. Again, loot dependent and chance based.
---
Tbh i feel less and less sympathy for them as time goes on. Every time a gang shows up and runs away a little bit more of my patience is eroded.
---
what types of abyssal 'key' can you do with a trio hawk in t4/t5, all of them or just a specific one?
---
This.. And add a fuel amount. So parma camping isnt possible. Solves the perma cloaky camping all day and gives eveyone else the cloak they need to do explo and such.
---
Only issue is implementation. 
---
Seriously the solution is just add fuel to them and a reload timer.. Gives us more than enough time to find a cloaky camper instead of wait to get ganked and hope for the best counter we have currently. I have no problem getting ganked any dying but when some asshole has been camping my pocket for literally fucking ever.. Im done.. Its not fun and its not good gameplay.. Yes I agree we are kinda to safe but thats cynos fault that should be nerfed. Spool up or charge time.. It shouldnt be poof cyno when the counter to it takes a min to set up. Not cloaky. Cloaky is and always has been a problem. And if you want to remove local fine give us strctures that implementat it again so coalitions actually have to set up an intel network.
---
Chinese mom is HOT
---
Fixed &lt;3
---
&gt; be forced to work in falloff like the AC Vargur
---
Vargur master race for L4s. The range is slightly lacking compared to pulse lasers but it's still better than torps or blasters and it's nothing a MJD jump can't fix. 
---
I love my paladin the most when I get a EM/Therm missions, but I seem to get loads of guristas, mercs, angels, etc, which need kin/therm or explo damage.
---
Noooooo! I want the Chinese to meme on the rest of eve, get them shitposting on somebody else. I want to see them join us in this meta as they join TQ. More glorious content!
---
I agree that t4 t5 is high end, especially with the hawk. I was just lucky that my chars were already speced into hawks. 
---
My hawks are dirt cheap as well. 60 to 70 mill. They only die to waves where you get scrammed webbed and neuted  by the damavik. Out of 30 runs of chaotic level, I've lost maybe 7 hawks total. 3 or 4 were due to me double clicking in space and accidentally running out of bounds.
---
Memes gonna be banned in the EU so that's one continent not able to shiptoast.
---
&gt; generally use bastion mode?
---
I use bastion mode for *range* control more than anything on my vargur. The trick is to use bastion without auto-repeat selected so you don't get stuck bastioned in space in an empty pocket waiting for the timer to tick down.
---
Interesting. I generally find ccp ghist ideaa facinating.
---
I saw RMT in the chaos for a second. And PGL. Lol
---
CCP: we want group pve content
---
players: multibox group pve content
---
nice.
---
Yes, it would make bots using VNIs not feasible. However, it would do this by making subcapital ratting as a whole not feasible. Even capital ratting would be severely hit.
---
I mean, do you really think a cloaky nullified t3c gang should just be able to run around shutting down an entire region of subcap ratters? And if not, how do you propose they react to something like this?
---
That's like me saying high class wormholes are too safe for people to krab in, so they should automatically spawn beacons like drifter holes do.
---
Ian is a grade A moron, and it's sad since he's been playing the game for like 10 years ud think osmosis would've taken affect
---
Option A is just wrong. Skill trading opened up the option to toss real world money at CCP to catch up skill wise. PLEX is injected into the market, traded for ISK which is used to buy Injectors from players extracting skills they no longer need. The increased supply is balanced out by the fact that training and extracting skills consumes PLEX, but net effect of skill trading existing is driving the price of PLEX down. Just take a look at the PLEX price after skill trading was introduced and you can see how the existence of skill trading affected PLEX price:
---
[https://www.adam4eve.eu/commodity.php?typeID=44992&amp;regionID=10000002&amp;avg=0&amp;from=2003-10-01&amp;until=2019-04-24](https://www.adam4eve.eu/commodity.php?typeID=44992&amp;regionID=10000002&amp;avg=0&amp;from=2003-10-01&amp;until=2019-04-24)   
---
And it's not like option B requires a degree in economics to figure out.   
---
CCP was doing frequent sales of both PLEX and the Meteor/Star/Galaxy Packs for over a year. Most likely to artificially increase the number of subscribed EVE accounts to make them more appetizing to a potential buyer. Not only did these sales suppress the PLEX prices. It also made it extremely profitable to run skill farms generating more or less 100% passive income. If the short term goal was just to drive the sub count up they accomplished their objective, even though it had some nasty side effects.  
---
After the company found a new owner they stopped artificially inflating the subscriber numbers and started running gametime for PLEX sales and introducing tings like the Injection Augmentor to suck up the excess PLEX, Extractors and Injectors introduced by the sales in 2018.  
---
Players seem to think that the PLEX prices we had over the last couple of years are the norm. Look at the graph linked above again. Since its introduction, PLEX price doubles over approximately 4 years. We have been behind the trend for a while, but PLEX is finally starting to get back to were it is supposed to be.
---
Personally I think that CCP has a very good idea of how the economy works. The players on the other hand seems to be just complaining no matter what they do. PLEX was introduced to combat illicit RMT. If the price is to low, we get an invasion of botting RMT renters, since it is more profitable to grind ISK in EVE than farming for gold or other virtual currencies in WoW or other MMOs. As long as peoples reaction to Rorqual nerfs are "I'll just add another Rorq alt to compensate", PLEX prices are not too high.
---
Thanks for the compliment and input! I try to visualize everything as if it was a movie in my head. It helps put actions to words.

---
who wants to join a alliance where your leaders morale post/alliance update is 1k words on how retarded you are
---
I don't think subcap ratting would get hit like you think it would as you can squeeze more subcaps into the same system than you can supers, and ideally subcaps would not force up the cost of securing local like supers and caps would. In addition to this, a subcap with an alt on the gates can get away from even a cloaky nullified t3 if they are paying attention and listening for gate the activation sound.
---
super ratting would get pushed deep into pockets and chains where you can secure the entrance system and use it like an early warning alert, this does not work 100% of the time and would indeed hit super and carrier ratting , but I don't think it would hit them that hard.
---
In the end, this system would encourage players to spread out to decrease the cost of keeping local up without a delay making it much more likely that players who are not on the ball in these fringe systems get caught more. 
---
risk increases with potential reward as it should.
---
That's a really funny way of spelling Shades name
---
I love that you just gave up on naming after a while. You can see it starting with the "Wompiee -&gt; Wompiee -&gt; Wompieee the Hutt" and then eventually just "001 -&gt; 002...".
---
Many is a number. &gt;:(
---
 What if I'm role playing as the white walkers?
---
He should have proposed minmatar suits or ammo right. Dont believe that crap about behind enemy lines. It doesnt happen with anything but a venture.
---
They are still recovering from yesterdays feed.
---
Join any smallgang corp in any sane, human alliance of people with jobs. I have never spent much time in eve being an F1 pusher.
---
Venture plexing overnight is not fun, neither epic, nor a good mechanic. Gotta upvote those minmatar ammo additions though
---
I tried, but I've always kinda been a solo player (&gt;tfw anxiety) and haven't really found a group that I either liked or felt accepted in.
---
you've wasted a significant amount of time typing all of these words. I have wasted significantly less.
---
do you know if they have a website?
---
for a few systems, yes you would. your staging would be secure, your main rorqal system would be secure, and some of your main pipe/ice systems would be secured, but the goal of the system is to make it infeasible to secure an entire region.
---
It operates on the assumption that to keep costs down and maximize profits, some groups will move people to less secured fringe systems or players would move as the secured pockets become more and more crowded.
---
The end result is more players would take more risk and thus losses would increase, still plateauing (just at a higher amount) and not climbing indefinitely.
---
the serenity inflation problem was largely due to botting. you don't necessarily need bots to multibox rorquals or rat, therefore your argument is invalid and completely retarded
---
Worth watching.
---
MAD PROPS to CCP Ghost. He sounds really passionate.
---
I figured this would be the case like almost all PvE. Missiles and drones will forever rule.
---
You'd just end up with the secure chokepoints being farther out, such as region gates. I could secure, for example, all of Catch by buying fullspeed local in 12 systems.
---
That's not bad for a region.
---
It could theoretically increase the danger if a gang slipped into a delayed-local pocket and then safelogged, for example.
---
How fast would local change is the other question. If I blew through a system top speed in an inty, would I even show up? I'm assuming not.
---
sorry, I don't have much to do besides check my cloaky alts every hour, and make sure my rorqual has not been tackled.
---
Yeah. Fuck Axel Voss, what a punchable face.
---
&gt; Cheap little thing
---
praxis is bigger than chimera lmao
---
Ideally if catch was secured by the method you propose, a wormhole would be catastrophic, also if you were burning top speed in an inty, the intended situation is that you would leave behind a ghost that would appear in local and then quickly leave. This opens up the opportunity for some fun mind-games with defense fleets that are chasing you and trying to use local to catch up.
---
was referring to
---
&gt; If someone’s botting you still won’t catch them
---
which is plain wrong, even if they are ratting 100% aligned, i can scout them with a cloaky toon and bubble their align point. Bouncing between random safes in alignment line still isnt perfect safety either, can always technically scan a slow-align VNI or extrapolate warpoff point and/or simply learn the bot evasion pattern. Bottom line so long as one does not have perfect intel about my presence / lack of presence in system (which local, and only local, provides), I can hunt bots with decent success all day.
---
If you're not a social player, you're not a social player, you do you. There's a lot more, however, to being in a small gang group than pushing f1 and following orders. That's more for large blocs of people.
---
To be fair I largely cured my allergy to F1 monkeying by stepping up and FCing, commanding bomber wings, dictor wings, or flying recon / light tackle / antitackle.
---
My take on players who just want to anchor up and press F1: it's the same kind of people that will mine or anom rat. There's lots of em, we need em in alliance, but I don't have to be one. This applies to isk making as much as fleet operations. I made my first bil on explo sites, I ninja huffed gas, guessed a few hisec pos passwords (got a can full of plex out of a pos with a password of "pos" once), and seeded myself into market trading in amarr. :)

No. Fuck off back to your shit hole.

I would generally recommend sticking with your old toon.
---
Pros:
---
* You get a head start on SP. (usually - there are a couple windows where that's not the case, but with a month of training I doubt you're in one)
---
* Your toon's history matches your play history. This one can matter if you want to later get into a corp that does background checks. As a recruiter, if you started a new toon I'd still want ESI info for the old toon as well, so you're better off continuing to use it.
---
Cons:
---
* If you did something heinous on the old toon, someone might remember you. (But, honestly, see point 2 under Pros.)

I've run a *couple* C4 sites with the dual Nestors that I use for C5 sites, and my impression was that the C4 sites are both slower to complete and less isk as a reward. That was a while ago though, so I'd defer to someone with more experience.

c5 and c6 space is safe cuz people don't hunt it like nullsec, it is safe because of a lack of cynos and supers. In the age of capitals, a dreadnaught or carrier kill is not much to write home about, supers and titans are high value targets, AT ships are high value targets, botters are targets, afk ratters are targets. you don't tend to find them all that often in C5 and C6 holes.

That may cause problems with systems changing hands while a Citadel is already there. Now the owners can not refuel their own structure or even dock in it.  
---
And if Citadels really are meant to be a POS replacement then having a forward base in enemy systems is needed. Maybe only allow Medium size (or smaller? New FOB citadels?)  citadels to be anchored in enemy systems. If you already have a Fort and you lose control of that system then you can still use it or unanchor it but you'll not be able to put a new one down until you retake the system... so best defend it or you've lost a capital staging.

Though nullsec gas mining probably makes more, and a venture is not ship to afk in anyway.
---
fresh Eve server, that gets reset every 1 yr/2 yrs would be amazing. Glad it got asked by him.
---
Dont use [Emojis](https://www.emoji.com/) you am supporting the NCDot/BOT child VNI camps !
---
&gt;I don't think subcap ratting would get hit like you think it would as you can squeeze more subcaps into the same system than you can supers, and ideally subcaps would not force up the cost of securing local like supers and caps would. In addition to this, a subcap with an alt on the gates can get away from even a cloaky nullified t3 if they are paying attention and listening for gate the activation sound.
---
Because, you know, all VNI ratters have alts they can afford to keep on a gate. And there are plenty of systems with only one entrance. 
---
&gt;super ratting would get pushed deep into pockets and chains where you can secure the entrance system and use it like an early warning alert, this does not work 100% of the time and would indeed hit super and carrier ratting , but I don't think it would hit them that hard.
---
With anom nerfs, there aren't enough of these deep pockets to sustain most ratting. Goons can definitely afford to just rely on cyno, and maybe the larger alliances (TAPI, FRT, NCPL), but not anything below that.
---
&gt;In the end, this system would encourage players to spread out to decrease the cost of keeping local up without a delay making it much more likely that players who are not on the ball in these fringe systems get caught more.
---
No, you force people to cluster into either dense, safe regions, or safe pockets in unsafe regions. If you want people to be spreading out you are doing literally the opposite of what you should be doing. This forces people to cluster into safe systems or not rat at all.
---
You seem to think that there's always going to be ratters for you to hunt, and that making it unsafe to rat will change nothing except make it easier to hunt. But in reality, most people (and bots) will just switch to a different income source. The ones that remain will do stuff like rat in secure system with either super umbrellas or a single entrance.
---
real talk if they made an eve classic that was the Incursion patch and lasted for 2 years, I would play the shit out of that.

Who's Trihex?
---
So bubble completely precludes warping unless you're in an immune ship (t3c cruiser with the correct subsystem or fleet interceptors). Bubbles also prevent jumps for ship that are capable.
---
Scram deducts 2 from your warp core strength which is generally enough to prevent warp (exceptions: deep space transports, venture, super carriers, and titans) and also shuts off mwd. Some faction scram deduct 3 points. Heavy scrams (battleship sized module) deducts 5. The maulus navy issue has a +2 strength bonus to scram.
---
Warp disruptor ("point") deducts 1 from warp core strength. Some faction ones deduct 2 points, Heavy (BS sized) ones deduct 3 points. None prevent mwd.
---
You can't warp if you're in a bubble or if sufficient scram or warp disruptor are applied to you to equal or exceed your warp core strengths (1 for most ships, 3 for venture or deep space transports, up to 26 for super carriers, up to 51 for titans.)
---
"congrats, your fleet members can follow basic instructions"
---
&gt;the serenity inflation problem was largely due to botting. you don't necessarily need bots to multibox rorquals or rat, therefore your argument is invalid and completely retarded
---
I was replying to the content generating part of that post and my point stands. Botting, multiboxing or whatever else in this context is irrelevant. Its not exactly difficult for you to find either, just scroll down a bit on this sub to see why TAMA made the decision to move, retard.
---
I actually wonder if success (or lack of) of Classic WoW might give CCP a push to put this in motion.
---
People always complain that making Eve Classic would spilt the player base but I think it would be a really cool idea and would causes lots of vets to return
---
I think you miss the point with your last bit about inactive accounts. I am talking about isk faucets and sinks and the gap present today is universally larger than it was when the economy was being closely monitored and adjusted.
---
Go look at some old data you might even be shocked to see there were many months where the faucets sucked more isk from the game then was generated.
---
Also discounting ISK in game because people went inactive is fundamentally retarded. Those people can come back at anytime. Banned or deleted accounts sure....dormant ones...never.
---
1) Incursions aren't as good ISK/H as you think, you will spend a lot of time sitting in queue
---
2) lol missions aren't anywhere near as good ISK unless you go full gevlon and multibox mining missions, or do NPC missions in npc null, but that brings a sizable risk from the local player pirates
---
3) DED sites are limited and take time to respawn
---
4) relic/data sites are limited and will take time to respawn in a system which you will be able to find; you will also have more competition

---
Gas broccoli tbh
---
This is goons we are talking about, any even remotely valuable system is filled to the brim with rorqs, of course they can afford to eat the cost, and because they have so many more players in space at any given time than anyone else, you would need to have a seriously penalizing tax of 30%/50% to balance this; and that would also harm the smaller groups as well.
---
They mine more than the rest of eve put together even on a bad day.
---
The real problem with this game, funnily enough, is the players; joining the most powerful side is the most logical option but it just makes the problem worse, and trying to change that is an uphill struggle as you will get people invested in your corp, and once they have enough SP/ISK they will fuck off to Goons to retire in Rorqual bliss.

That's true, a wormhole could be a big opportunity to gank people in unsecured systems.

would wonder if people would immediately ball up into blobs again but 200 subcaps still have more interesting counter play than 200 supercaps
---
Have you considered using C3-A 'Hivaa Saitsuo' Ballistic Controls rather than the single BCS+DDA? Does that actually give better DPS? (I don't have the numbers in front of me, just a thought)
---
that was the purpose of making the cost scale with activity, smaller and less active groups would probably end up with a 5-10% cost of the systems total output to keep local running fast, but as activity spools up, so does the cost, in the end goons would end up with that 50% tax (or more in extreme cases). Im not gonna lie to myself that this would hurt a group like them significantly, they will find a way, but it would hopefully force their individual players to look for more risky activities to continue to plex their accounts or make isk at the rate they currently do.

Given you seem to use the nicest words possible not exactly highly experienced in pvp like i suspect you often misidentify the comp you guy's are forming as fight-able while in reality it's likely a no win scenario or forcing the gang to be so vulnerable they might as well fit bastion modules.
---
INB4 reacts were disabled due to /u/CaseyLP 's react-bot.
---
&gt;that was the purpose of making the cost scale with activity
---
The problem there is that Goon space is incredibly safe. If you have half a brain and use their intel tools, the chance of being caught is absolutely minimal.
---
Therefore, they would respond to a 50% tax by simply running 2x the accounts.

I don’t know how practical it would be start a new server.
---
People forget something crucial about EVE: you have to climb the learning curve.
---
Sure, you could all start with the same ships, but a 10-year bitter vet knows what he’s doing when flying that ship in a fleet. Newbro might think ‘hey, we’re at least starting with the same gear’, but you’re not starting with the same knowledge.
---
It’s the knowledge that’s important. People would complain about ‘unfair advantage’ when they got clobbered by people who’ve been there for years and knows how the circus works.
---
You can’t buy your way into the big time. To wit: we’ve seen the new guys who buy a toon, a ‘high level ship’ and plug blue and purple stuff into it because it’s blue and purple, it’s got to be good right? That’s a super duper elite ship, right? Sure, it’s a great ship. The sad part is: newbro doesn’t know why he\s using it. ‘What is this thing for? Why do I have it? How do I use it?’ You can’t pick that up in the first week of EVE. You get your ass kicked a lot and you fight a lot. Then, yes.

A new start of the server does not mean that the old hands start with a blank slate.

---
No noob protection, although you do start in high-security space, which is safe-ish. You can still be attacked, but the space police (Concord) show up in 5-16 seconds and kill the attackers. There are also wars, various scams, and baiting that people do. But so long as you fly cheap ships (t1/t2), doesn't haul hundreds of millions in T1 haulers, aren't at war, don't shoot people, and be very suspicious of anything that seems too good to be true, you'll be fine.
---
Still not as bad as the whole "get in fleet and defend the space you pay to live in" thing Bot has going on.
---
If your alliance can be demoralized by memes you deserve to fail at whatever you're doing tbh
---
WTF? That seems a little blatant to me.
---
Some peoples really like to be slaves , event in a video game.

Sorry but the Magnate is the best battlefield salvager/looter. Frigate speed and align, 1000m3 of cargo space, 25% faster cycling salvagers for warp to wreck salvage/loot warp to ping rinse repeat.
---
You mean shoud a T3 gang be able to shut down ratters who can't or won't defend themselves? Certainly. If you don't like their being a gang of people hunting in your space then chase them out, not dock up until they go away.
---
Confirmed, alliance checks out
---
Strictly speaking the bot would be watching for something appearing on the overview, not a gate flash.
---
Yep.
---
Try chasing a nullified t3c gang sometime, let me know how that works out for you
---
Don't let your memes be dreams
---
I'm trying to be inclusive and optimistic.
---
Wouldn't that be a good thing? I see no downsides to fewer bots. If that means people need to actually pay attention to make ISK, even better.
---
Rapid expansion diluted the meme-wise cullture.
---
If they want to do it right it should be at no extra cost to your current eve subscription (people who plex wouldn't qualify for it) and obviously no injectors and no plex
---
Actually I would be ok with like a 5$ increase add on from 15$ to 20$ per month to have eve classic

---
Vpns. They have pretty high usage there albeit you're taking a total using one afaik.
---
true. but still a relatively even playing field. not in 1v1 combat obviously. but in group combat it would be a lot more even
---
Blame someone for not knowing what you know.... That always works. It could easily said that the Landlord failed in their job to inform renters of the who/what/when/where.
---
... but be a dick.
---
&gt; no explorer or DED site runner will get caught unless they make extremely stupid mistakes. 
---
That depends on a lot of things. Explorers, even competent ones, die every day to people hunting them. Also while running DED sties is safer, a significant uptick in people running them means more people competition for sites and more people traveling. The former would mean more people taking risks to clear a site, and the latter increases both increases the chance of getting caught in a gate camp, and encourages said gate-camps. Aside form that a good hunter can scan a site in one pass , lowering the chance of the target seeing probes, and if d-scan is an issue then that is what recons are for.

2. Astero is nice for pvp
---
&gt; With anom nerfs, there aren't enough of these deep pockets to sustain most ratting. Goons can definitely afford to just rely on cyno, and maybe the larger alliances (TAPI, FRT, NCPL), but not anything below that. 
---
Do people normally cyno in to save any subcap that isn't bait?
---
Rekkingcrew is full of so many memers we had to get rid of custom discord emojis because it was causing problems.
---
I didn't know local showed you what was on the other side of a cyno.

Jabber and RnK are both relics of a dead era. Ghost is a pretty new CCP-er, he joined in like 2016-ish if I remember right, long after all the Clarion Calls that made RnK a legend had been published. And at that point many/most EVE corps were at least migrating to Discord if not already full-force on it. 
---
The notion of a complete server reset is hardly surprising, there's a lot of people that have entertained the notion over the years. It's one of the few things that would get me back into the game at this point, for example.

Fine, then the fac po do it, I don't care about the lore reasons.

Local also doesnt show whats on the fleet of the blops cyno, right? :D

I never understood that whole thing and gave up when it was just memed to infinity.

So when i was in Feign, i would set tax to 100% during all OPS, i know this might not be the case, however maybe Dotlan pulled that info during an op?

That leads to the problem of seeing what is in the site, either through d-scan or waiting for someone else to take it first, then just bringing whatever counters it. Also, while FW needs an overhaul, a change to enforce dueling seems very counter to the "unfair sandbox" aesthetic of eve. It's one reason I don't like the abyss even though I think the content itself is great.
---
Is this his
---
Hmm i guess snuff will be a good start we look forward to seen you our new neighbors to be good content you will make for us
---
To be fair, they are communists.
---
yep. the character is with another person now.this character was sold to him by some irish lad
---
too much content in wormholes.  apparently.
---
Ah guess you can't buy skill with twitch money
---
Destiny is also the one who made this reddit post along time ago on this sub 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/21sf2q/why_the_fuck_cant_we_kill_this_guardian_or_the/
---
Apparently it got downvoted to oblivion even though he was in the right.
---
Trihex is/ was a speed runner/ smash player?
---
destiny is like the godfather of streaming in away
---
CCP needs to ban all this alliance.
---
Paying attention doesn’t save you from a cloaky loki. Or even a hyper rigged ceptor, depending on where he warps in from. After all, bots are capable of hitting dscan every second. If you make it so they can’t see you coming, then there’s no way a player can. It’s just not possible to create a situation like that. 
---
And again, bots will just move to other stuff. They’ll make less isk/hr, sure, but the total amount of isk being generated will also drop way off, so their dollars/hr will stay about the same. 
---
And cutting nullsec isk generation without touching wormholes makes no sense, so again I propose that all high class holes generate the drifter beacons to make bearholes less profitable.
---
It's WTB Killmarks killing his own alts titan.
---
He is the dude called Vertiso who spied inside horde and walked away with a lot of buyback isk. He is now working his way in to a position of power in snuff.
---
https://imperium.news/pandemic-heist/
---
He has his alt Nylund Akarry in Horde
---
https://evewho.com/pilot/Nylund+Akarry
---
As well as his alt corp:
---
https://evewho.com/corp/Triglavian+Menace.
---
And his logistics corp:
---
https://evewho.com/corp/Messerschmitt+Vertrieb+und+Logistik
---
Sorry if my phrasing was weird, I meant that I do C5's in a regular non-Wolf rayet hole with my snakes and was wondering if the C4 wolf rayets were any faster isk/hr.
---
Fair enough. But your gang would be 100% rdy at time of cyno, you have dscan intel, zkill links intel, etc. Defenders doesn’t even know you exist. And a drop starts and ends in seconds. I’m all for making life in null more difficult, but local delay would not work unless its for just a few seconds.
---
Plus I guess I wanna have fun going 2km/s in a T3D haha
---
Unironically, yes.
---
I just wanna say... we're really bad neighbours.... like, think of your drunken neighbour, who does meth, sits on the porch with a shotgun screaming racist shit... yeah, that's us. But worse.
---
Who wants to join an alliance where all the leadership was banned for cheating?
---
well this was like 2 months into the game.  he was moving stuff with the dread and forgot to refit it . and just jumped into a fight for an objective. weve done some dumb shit as a corp.. but my man it was some of the best time ive had in game. no matter how dogshit we were
---
If they're running from you they aren't killing your ratters.
---
Yeh, it's not meant to be more that 30 seconds tops, just enough to locate and tackle your target if you are good.
---
20 seconds would probably be better.
---
I really feel like you haven’t been part of a nullsec alliance in quite a while, if ever, and have absolutely no idea how these changes would play out
---
Amazing!
---
Careful, you might have to change this post to “Happy Thanksgiving” if your leadership sees you engaging in wrongthink.
---
I am just getting back into EvE, do the entropic weapons have an upper limit on the damage, or can they just keep going higher and higher? Also, can they be used on ships that are not the new ship faction?
---
10-20 seconds is fair, yeah.
---
If you're writing a paper for a class you should stick to what you understand.
---
The real question is if the same players would have been banned for buying PLEX aquired with legally botted isk.
---
That's all that matters I suppose
---
It’s thinly veiled enemy propaganda. Pay it no mind.
---
no and no
---
Check evejobs
---
It depends. The Amarr arc for example has a choice of implants based on the choice you make (Amarr/Sansha for part 3), both of which are valued *relatively* high. I can't check prices at the moment because evemarketer seems to be down. :(
---
On the other hand, the Caldari arc used to give a choice of either a POS module or modified synth drugs, neither of which (iirc) was worth as much as the other rewards. That might've changed since the POS mod was converted to a strucure rig, I don't know for sure.
---
The pirate arcs (Guristas and Angel) both give their respective faction ewar mod and a 1-run cruiser bpc, but their main benefit (imo) is a massive standings boost. 
---
And last but not least, they can be re-run roughly every 3 months. :)
---
I don't know how that would prove that they're bots. Isn't that a rental alliance? Back when I tried renting, I set the tax rate of my solo corp to 100% so that all the ISK would gather into the corp wallet instead of into many alts' wallets where I'd have to log them in individually to transfer cash to my mains. Corp wallet just makes it super easy to manage your ISK.
---
You can't read the title?
---
If people don't show up to fleets our CEO has threatened to flip the tax to 100% for all services and ratting. /u/tridgit
---
Try it with Tachyons, longer range crystals have lower thermal damage meaning you lose applied dps vs Guristas etc. Tachs, apart from having glorious dps, have high optimal range meaning you can stick to MF most of the time, meaning more thermal damage.
---
You do SO much dps while not having to rely on falloff that it's not all that bad.
---
I probably wasn't playing then, and it may be a different economist now but when the economist was first introduced they weren't generating monthly (or yearly or anything) reports. I can assure you though in the old days there certainly wasn't as much or even close to as much faucets. As a matter of fact I myself posted a few times on the forums about the huge amount of isk that was being generated and the lack of isk sinks.
---
I'm too lazy to look at old ones tbh, I am skeptical that faucets sucked out ANYWHERE close to what was generated unless it was a short term action.
---
And yes it is in fact retarded, but iirc they do include that in their reports for some reason.
---
I hope in your academic treatise, a gripping read I'm sure, you define "shit they have to go through". Maybe they are having fun and they dont see it that way at all. Also, framing your questions this way is not helping you get good info unless you are trolling, in which case I encourage you to carry on.
---
&gt; I don’t know how practical it would be start a new server.
---
i wouldn't play it.
---
i've said it before, and i'll say it again.
---
eve is actually pretty meh as a game, the only reason i still play is my accumulated assets. out there, there are a myriad of better games, the problem is none of them are better than eve once you're sitting on a few years worth of accumulated assets.
---
a 'server wipe'  or wow2, or whatever would be the thing that'd turn me in to a productive member of society.
---
starting eve again from scratch? fuck that, there are way better ways to spend my time than rebuilding what i already have.
---
The damage is capped technically by the amount of ammo it can load, it resets if you stop shooting because you lost target, ran out of rammo or just stopped shooting.
---
And no they only fit on the new ships.
---
Except the purpose of writing a paper for class is to research something you don't understand or know already....
---
His dream of breaking free from copper is almost a reality
---
I'm not sure if you're joking because that sentiment of "everyone who disagrees with leadership/goes against the narrative is a spy" is actually way too common in this game.
---
1, 2, many, many-1, many-2,  many-many, many-many-1, many-many-2
---
Despite what standing fleet comms might've tought you, PH and PL are basically independant. 
---
If you want to look for "second class citizen" incidents you should look at renters.
---
The answer to that is that 80% of renters are bots / rmters and dont give a fuck about the game, so people generally dont respect them but rather treat them like they treat the game: As a means to an end
---
The last part was a meme, saw some reddit posts on /r/eve last time asking questions for a paper they're writing.
---
Speaking of ping reactions if you react with a poop emoji on a Steadyo horde ping he will literally have an autistic fit
---
:-)
---
Maybe that's why he never learned the point of answering questions and instead contributed with a pointless comment.
---
I like tachs just fine except they struggle with hitting frigates. I haven't tried tachs with a grappler so maybe I'll give that a try and see how I like it.
---
Do the larger entropic sizes have larger magazines, or are do all sizes have the same per reload? If the light can get that high, that must mean the large are pretty devastating, as long as they are allowed to keep shooting of course.
---
1. PH was never treated like shit, if you think they were, pls explain how
---
2. Horde is as dependant on NC/PL as they are on Horde
---
So trolling. Excellent. Do carry on.
---
Aaahhh. If you want to play in a T3D, skip the C4 and go straight to a C13. The Wolf-Rayet effect is stronger and since site-to-site transition time is cheap for a T3D, you can make very good isk off of triggering gas sites and clearing their rats. Something like a Vast is probably doable in a WR-fit T3D and should be as lucrative as a C4 site if not more so. I can't remember for sure, but I think some of the C13s also have high class sites in them that you may be able to run.
---
no one in INIT leadership was banned for cheating. 
---
a wanna be space important nobody was banned plus their two of their 3 top fcs.
---
And i'm not INIT
---
Agreed completely about FI.RE currently. Thanks for the info!
---
If Gobbins ever, dunno, asks us to give him real life money on a kickstarter to have a book published (or something random like that) I promise you many would quit PH, of course. 
---
Who would not? You’d have to be a real submissive bitch to stay, amirite? /s
---
I imagine its the same with many other alliances.
---
I guess we'll see how well this comment ages in just a couple of days...
---
&gt; You know the end is nigh when PL is instructing TEST on how to meme...
---
"My memes are better than your memes" wow great post dude A+
---
didn't you read the Sapporo post? they are in danger of being evicted!!
---
You can support EVE Workbench without any issue as MarkeeDragon is one of the official sellers of PLEX activation cards and other EVE Online stuff 😉
---
We wouldnt work with a fraudster and think we also would not be featured by CCP if we where.
---
i believe they were talking about having a second server where everything was fresh. instead of wiping the current one.. plus  this server would be wiped every year or two .. so its mostly for shits and giggles
---
This is why it’s not going to happen and I can’t blame you.
---
It would also be hugely unfair to the paying customers who’ve spent years building the environment just the way it is. EVE has an indelible history.
---
Which ties into: if they really did a clean swipe, they’re erasing everything from EVE’s history. All the memories, all the remnants are gone. Why would you have Titanomachy at B-R5RB if nobody can fly a titan, let alone a fleet of them for a couple of years. They would become meaningless ghosts.
---
The cemetery. The statue. All that would become meaningless.
---
Hilmar has already said there won’t be, there can’t be, an EVE 2.0. That’s not the kind of place it is.
---
I also agree that there are other games than EVE but AFAIK nobody’s even attempting to do what CCP have done. Well, other than Star Citizen, which will see a release SOON^TM. Somewhere in 2062 or something.
---
EVE is like -the-coolest-place- in the city, where all the people in the know go to. It’s got a lot of warts and wrinkles, but if you took it all out and built a new interior, you wipe out everything it was and why would anyone want to go back? All the old hands stay away. The new people coming in have no idea of the history, it means nothing to them. They make it a new place.
---
EVE is what it is, because that’s what we made of it.
---
Thank you for the perspective. I totally agree.
---
The biggest problem with this post is you have not understood the switch of power from PL to PH over the years. The idea of PH being a feeder corp didn't last long, "we are a powerful alliance that needs no PL".
---
The second powerful  is mostly NC. now a days. As for why don't we breck our chains of past and leave pamfam, why? What benefit would leaving strong allies bring?
---
Also why do PH do most of the shit jobs, PH have 100 times more active members the NC. and PL put together. If work needs doing PH has the numbers to do it better.
---
why is the vod muted at the beginning of your timestamp
---
Basically exactly what Plex is now.
---
Instead of breaking Plex down into a bunch of points like it is now, 1 Plex used to equal 1 month subscription which meant they needed a separate microtransaction currency which was aurum.
---
whats your fit?
---
Kick SUAD
---
tracking script + Gleam works fine unless they're really up close or transversal is an issue.
---
He did best, posted on reddit
---
which would split an already small population.
---
that's going to result in a shit amount of people playing on either server.
---
splitting the population is the very last thing we need when the game already feels as if there aren't enough active players outside of an "oh shit somebody dun goofed so we're dropping the hammer" type events.
---
The intro probably had copyrighted music.
---
it gives about 11 more dps, might replace on next run to trade hub
---
You clearly have an irrevocable bias. You started off with a presumption that newbie alliance "are treated like shit". Therefore you have proven you have little interest in actual understanding. Perhaps if you took a more objective approach you would find that the question you *should* be asking is "In massively multiplayer games, what causes some players to seek elite status, while others just play for fun".
---
It’s one nice big family :^ )
---
Maybe it is the only way lady Scarlet can communicate with these muppets.
---
Baited on a free init flair.
---
They all hold 500 and yes they get very devastating.
---
but mostly waits
---
You're maaaad.
---
Plot twist: Dran has joined the revolution!
---
Drexit now! Don't let your memes be dreams!
---
In Panfam, Pandemic horde, Pandemic Legion and Northern Coalition are 3 alliances working independantly each other with commun objectives.
---
But since the Tapirium deployment, we knew that we have 2 huge ennemy and need each other.
---
They've got an open door policy for dissent.
---
Nobody question the fuhrer!
---
Like the two pings from creecher and PGL earlier - those two you really need reactions for.
---
You forgot lots.
---
Well yeah, they are. Our memes have cute dino pictures.
---
I can't tell if you're a dick or you're just joking here
---
i just dont see it really taking people away permanently.  since you are not going to be able to keep accumulating wealth. plus we wont really know till we try it see how it goes. " bench for waitmarks" as some would say
---
Don’t mine with the guy below. It’s a trap
---
Cmon, its the average
---
That's literally how I discovered that they're gone, I wanted to pingsock PGL
---
I have been using speech to text a good bit lately when on my phone.  I have noticed if I don't edit, it looks like Lady Scarlets posts.
---
I think he just wanted to shed karma in the least interesting way possible
---
Error 404, meme not found
---
Creecher and PGL coming to blows - we really need the ability to pick a side.
---
That's not a permanent state. Don't you ever fly into frt space? Easy VNI kills to make there. Lot of bots are really badly programmed and takes time to warp out. And ever VNI kill is exactly the same fit...
---
There’s a few things that come before that.
---
You could never say EVE combat is physically hard, like actual guys getting shot at in a war zone. That would be too preposterous for words.
---
But you don’t show up in a fleet with a ship fitted with whatever you happened to have floating around in the hangar, right? That’s not how it works, right? [Well, not in the fleets I am in, YMMV].
---
What the old hands do is prepare for that fight, which is the lame pressing on a button. But that’s like saying a Ferrari is the same as a Buick Impala just because you press the same pedal to go faster.
---
In a true newbie fleet, newbie is going to fly a boat with 3 different types of guns, one of which they’re going to forget to get the right kind of ammo for and. Another one will have ammo in the spout and as soon as the guns cycle empty they don’t reload and they have no idea why because nobody told them they have to have ammo in the hold to be able to reload. Half the fleet assembles at the wrong gate. 5 Assholes are jumping straight through because nobody can tell them what to do! Tell me I’m bullshitting.
---
They are not going to coordinate, they would not know how to. Setting up the overview alone would be a piece of arcana they just didn’t think of as an option when they first set out. The basic idea that it’s not a fucking democracy and that ‘my opinion is just as valid as yours is!’ does not count. I’d like to see them call targets.
---
Versus seasoned hands who are going to fly doctrine, in a coherent whole with a properly assembled fleet and an experienced FC.
---
You know that would be the difference, you know that’s the difference that matters.
---
As soon as the fight starts their boat is getting blown up. Their pod is blowed up. They don’t know what to look at first. They don’t know who to go for. They have no logis and would not know how to coordinate that [if they were experienced WoW / EQ raiders, they would have an idea about healers protecting tanks]. They’re still going to get their asses kicked.
---
Thanks for the info, I really want to try using these ships in Combat Exploration Sites now, don't have to worry about not having enough DPS to break the final guys!
---
At equal skill in an actual fight the only difference is the FC. So the 100 would probably win.
---
In a elite dvd/no fc setting, normal null line members today cant actually fly their ships much better than a newbie after a couple of weeks, so the "newbies" would probably still win.
---
That's a reasonable devil's advocate position if the corps were like 10 members or so, but not when the corps in questions have 145 and 138 members.
---
Wouldnt work. What made 2004-2008 so memorable were the unique characters and lack of coalition bullshit. The players are gone and even if they weren't, they'd still be 15 years older, so definately not in the same mindset (I know *Im* not).
---
The coalition bullshit and forming of 2k vs 2k fights, capital umbrellas and whatnot are something we know *now*, so it'd just get transferred to the Classic universe.
---
If you want to mine, get in a new bro alliances test/goons/brave or Ph. You can earn omega in at most 80 hours of playing, in a venture. Then do the 4 day train for procurer and earning you next month in 20 hours. 
---
If a moon jackpots these numbers will go down dramatically. Also when there is no moon to mine setup some PI to earn some next cash.
---
the dude who replied to you is wrong, they spool up to 150%
---
For the same reason, I loved when Hecates try killing my Enyo. I do the same or more dps, better tracking, faster, and better tank. I do like that probe scanner, though.
---
I'm not trying to defend potential bots here, but it's 2019 now and everyone has skill injector farms. It's possible that they just joined their SP farm alts into that corp as well for the reasons I stated above.
---
Frt?
---
Downvoted as amateur trolling.
---
If by some chance this is actually a genuine post, then you entirely misunderstand both the history and present of these alliances, and god help whoever has to mark this "paper."
---
You cant anchor anything in a C13 though correct? I just anchored a raitaru in a C4 wolf rayet, thats why I asked :P
---
These guys fester in wicked creek.
---
Atleast 500 bot reports last month from just me
---
And enough vni kills to keep me policing them
---
I've had one guy get on his main, start coralling his bots and say some pretty badly translated shit talk. These guys and Forward Dawn Buisness Corperation are for sure some of the most blantant botters in the game.
---
Unfortuantely ive killed mostly real people. I stopped fragging the lowly ratters out of mercy since theyre trying to play the game by the rules. Its incredibly hard to catch these bots, which is kind of sad. Ive probably hit the wallet of real noobs harder than these server farm cartel guys.
---
dude.
---
stats for last week are
---
Horde: 1995
---
NC.: 496
---
PL: 390
---
Pretty far from 100 times
---
Horde definitely needs nc/pl. Horde can't take any other of the big alliances head on in a super brawl. NC/PL has around 4 times Hordes super and titan numbers. 
---
A fight between NC/PL and Horde would be pretty fucking close
---
It wouldn't work, for reasons I mentioned earlier.
---
And yea, it's bizarre that a CCP guy doesn't know some of the prime people from back in the day. Or the tech. Or terminology. Not even gonna bother watching that garbage, nevermind that I don't enjoy watching other people play games (and them somehow earning money with it? what the actual fuck)
---
TIL, this game has prostitutes, lol. Somehow I've always been stuck to exotic dancers as pleasure cargo.
---
Show us on this doll where the elite PvP'r touched you.
---
&gt;Are you dumb or just a renter?
---
Those are synonyms
---
They are deployed away from deklein. That's why the fly weren't there
---
Touche, that's one possibility I hadn't thought of.  Still think botting is the most likely reason though.
---
X for the X god.
---
WTF, NC + PH + Snuff + Test(allies?) , i thought that NC  and Horde are our enemies as the imperium so what is Test doing there?
---
I think you mean above? Oh, wait! Wanna go mining?
---
Fix the man some eggs bitch!
---
&gt; At equal skill in an actual fight the only difference is the FC. So the 100 would probably win.
---
I just posted something with a bit of length. I’m not going to copy/paste that here.
---
I’m not going to say line member are necessarily very good [but there’s really no reason not to, it’s just a matter of education and experience], if they have any sort of fleet experience they’re going to be vastly better than truly total n00bs.
---
- newbie has no idea how to equip the ship [3 different guns, the wrong kind of ammo, or no ammo in the hold]
---
- newbie has no idea how to work in a fleet
---
- ‘the only difference is the FC’ is like saying: Our guy is an experienced F1 driver, your guy is a dude who can navigate Walmart on an electric cart. It’s practically the same!
---
- newbie has no idea of the importance of setting the overview. They’re likely not even going to find it at first.
---
- newbie has no idea about recon
---
They have so many disadvantages over an experienced fleet, they lack cohesion, their ship is not going to be equipped properly and/or they won’t know why they have the modules that they do, what they are for and how to use them.
---
I’ve now been trying to make the argument for why 100 people would over power a fleet of 20, given newbies versus bitter vets with the same SP, and the more I think about it, the more the 100-man fleet is minced meat. Or I would have to go by the assumption that 10 years in that crazy place has taught people nothing and they’re just bumping into walls as they walk through their house. I’m not saying that’s not what happens, I think it’s stretching it.
---
Ahh gotcha, thanks!
---
You need two falcon pilots and two Sabre toons. Find a pipe system and camp either side. Cloak Sabre’s on each side right at 0 and the falcons at a 50ishkm perch. Then choose what you engage.
---
no auto aiming either :P
---
you Sir. Have sold your soul to the devil.  You joined snuff and now have turned in to a shitposter.
---
Are you stupid?
---
For real. Can't buy your way onto the big leagues. 
---
Had an odd fellow in alliance chat yesterday calling out everyone flying through his rented system, saying "you need to leave NOW, this is MY space." Thought it was odd he was communicating that in alliance chat, so I looked him and his Corp up. 20 day old Corp with 3 members, 6th day in alliance. Him and his single account alts, buying out a system thinking he'll make it big. Probably bought PLEX directly and sold it to do his initial buy in. I look forward to seeing if he'll still be around after May.
---
Implying I wasn't before :thinking:
---
Correct. My concern with T3D ratting in a C4 wr is that I'm not at all sure the wr effect will be strong enough to let you do your thing, and the main slowdown in C4 sites is warp distances, an issue that is bad enough for drone boats and even worst if you need to get up close or sig-tank.
---
The post is about Fraternity bots. Frt.
---
I wouldn't mind having some ships on an office desk and I only just started playing, so the highest-skill ship that I have and can use is a Maller. Would certainly affect my budget for Chaos Space Marines, though.
---
If you are trying to defend against 1-2 guys, the bring friends yourself. The biggest problem with hunting in NS is that you may go 10-15 jumps and every other system find a ratter, but within 30sec they have all docked up. It doesn't matter what they or I are in, ones mere presence in local is enough to make everyone who is not AFK making a burrito turtle. This isn't purely a local problem either, a lot of this is because any ship can become a capitol fleet with the activation of one module, so you have to treat everyone as if they have a fleet behind them. Another problem is that PvE is just too simple. Not only is it complacently mind numbing, but it is so safe you can orbit a site with a 70mil cruiser and walk away for 30min to clear a site. If combat sites required significant player interaction then you would probably see a lot of ratters die, even with local as it stands now.
---
Another problem is that we are operating under an different system of values. From my perspective ratting shouldn't be an inherently safe activity. I am not saying that it should be so dangerous that every tine someone enters system looking for a kill it is a death sentence for a ratter, but on the other hand tackling a ratter is a good source of content for smaller groups. It's not that someone goes out roaming because they have a craving for VNI kills, instead the goal is to get a fight. That is not to say I would turn down a VNI kill, but I would much prefer a system where the best method of defense is to hunt me, not to dock up and wait for me to leave. I see ratting as a postnatal source of PvP.  
---
On the other hand many other people see ratting as a tedious necessity, and often want to interact with it as little as possible and still collect ISK. People like this don't see ratters as a direct source of PvP, and instead see them as a way to fuel other types of PvP. These are the type of people who get the majority of there PvP though larger scale fleets. They don't want the small scale fights between 5-10 people because on the grand scheme of things they don't matter. They want the large scale battles where you can say I was there. They want there weakly 500 man ferox brawl. They want to be able to go home at the end of the day with a bunch of shiny capital kills. They see ratting a fuel for their PvP.
---
Neither side is wrong, one side is looking for a good feed where the other is going to blob any fight they can. The problem comes from the fact that many of the recent changes have swung the balance towards the ratter, and the smaller gangs have suffered for it. The advent of citadels have made it so you can't force the other side to fight you by bubbling a station, and that there is now a station in every system. The reduction in jump fatigue has made it all the easier to  drop caps on anything that moves, and the unwell jump bridges are significantly safer then the old POS version ever was. It use to be that people would rat in battleships, but drones have been so effective that now it's either cruisers or carriers. The most recent balance pass to caps helped this issue, but ultimately was a change to the effectiveness of ships, and not something that will significantly change how you hunt or react to hunters.
---
As an aside, WH ratting should probably be looked at, but considering that CCP doesn't seem to be terribly interested in the EVE WH community, good luck with that.
---
A gentleman and scholar. You’re in the wrong sub.
---
The 100 tomes, was clearly a exaggeration. 
---
Though your numbers do not take in to account most newbros don't multibox, veteran players do. Pl,nc numbers will be inflated more then hordes
---
just ransom the supers too with a fork
---
PL keeps control on the disband button and most of the assets.
---
 Question: Why do subservient alliances like Test still obey to alliances like Goonswarm?
---
See what I did there,  you are coming in with a uninformed biased opinion and wanting conformation the public 
---
&gt; Before you guys downvote especially if you're in PH, this is an actual  question and not meant to be taken as a trigger warning or a diss. 
---
Bullshit you dont want an actual answer,  you have to come to stir shit up with your bias 
---
&gt; I'm writing a paper on this for class on gaming social structures and  was wondering what stops players who aren't affected by a game in real  life to not tolerate the shit they have to go through by other players. 
---
Hope you fail
---
scorpion navy issue. i used rattle then planned to get a nighthawk, but boy SNI is just such a hard tank that i am impressed
---
Yeah, I feel your issue, C4's suck ass compared to C3's because of the spawn distances. I'm hoping I can heat my MWD and get in close with two T3D's. It's a real juicy hole though with good PI and everything so I just couldn't pass it up as a solo/small group. We'll see!
---
&gt; "you need to leave NOW, this is MY space."
---
I had to grin at that one. It’s almost unfair :-). “It’s my space.” Newbies are so precocious *giggle*.
---
I was in corp channel once, we’re in 0.0, we have a guy who was almost shitting his pants ‘going into nun sec! Wooooo!!!’. He has this idea where people are just going to respect the rules, treat each other with respect, have fair fights. The rest of the crew can’t believe the guy. So, I start to explain how wildly out of kilter his view of what 0.0 *should* be versus what it actually *is*, and I lay down the naked reality.
---
He does not want to believe me. I tell him [there’s quite a few of us in corp channel] “If anyone here believes I’m fucking with our new friend here, please feel free to speak up and tell him I’m full of shit and that’s not how it is.”
---
Chirping crickets. Of course. I didn’t try to paint a worse picture of what 0.0 is like, but there is a reality to if, and everybody there, minus one, knew what that reality is.
---
They told me the next day that he quit corp after I logged for the night :-).
---
“It’s my space” Hahahahahahahahahaaaaaa, too funny.
---
that can only mean one thing: LS was a bot all along!
---
There's "piracy", aka PVP, and then there's real piracy. Real piracy is when you attack for profit.
---
To be a real pirate, you need to approach your piracy as a business. You need income &gt; expenses. That usually means picking helpless, rich targets while flying the cheapest of ships. I found frigate-sized explorers to be the ideal target for pirates. Their ships tend to be helpless, while their drops can be worth 100m+. 
---
For low sec, a T1 tackling ship like the Condor should be sufficient. I found it best to patrol a constellation, pre-scan every relic and data site, and bookmark a spot where most of the cans are within 20km. With a Condor and 3 x warp disruptors, you can warp-in and quickly point an explorer. Blap and loot. The only frigate to be wary of are Asteros as they can be PVP-fitted. You can upgrade your hunting ship to an Astero, but it'll increase your cost by over 10x. Remember that piracy is a business.
---
For wormholes, I found camping relic/data sites in a stealth bomber ideal. However, it's more boring.
---
In NPC null sec, I found interceptors to be ideal as they can bypass warp bubbles. It's the same strategy as in low sec, bookmark relic/data sites where cans are within 20km, and patrol the constellation. When you see an explorer on D-scan, warp to the bookmark and blap.
---
Who does what?
---
what lol?   
---
of course multiboxing is a advantage, if i can do logi/dps as good as you can do dps you can't say thats "inflated".
---
Hordes numbers would be more "inflated" as 100 of the guys on grid would be in shit t1 ships.
---
Not sure why you got to feel like you're better than your friends, fact is you're not. You're both co dependant on each other. 
---
IF NC/PL decided to evict Horde they would just drop supers and there would be nothing Horde could do about that. That will never happen though as the PANFAM coalition are one of the "most stable"
---
Pl leadership have literally never help PH ceo.
---
I will always champion the weak, the humble, the emojiless
---
Write all you want about PH being treated like shit, but please don't say KF is, as that is far from the truth.
---
If I were you I would also stop trying to write a paper while going in to it with a preconceived notion of the outcome and coming here to ask to justify your outcome. Do actual research, not just reading a few things on r/eve. In fact, go to PH subreddit and ask around there, you may get better answers than hopping into this subreddit and spewing garbage like you did in the OP.
---
Have a nice day.
---
NO DISSENT! PLEASE CLAP!
---
Looks that way.
---
Ah, they cap out at that? I was sort of expecting something like that. It still appears pretty devastating, even with only 150%, do you know if these weapons still have smashing blows and stuff?
---
Dude he was calling out spoke up later in alliance after being afk.
---
"Chill, I'll leave you alone with Goon lamp soon enough."
---
"What's that?"
---
"You'll find out sooner or later."
---
"Who is this other person in my system?"
---
"The Goon lamp."
---
"What's a Goon?"
---
No one talked to him the rest of the evening.
---
The podcast starts around 4h 40m.
---
How do I gank a vexor?
---
Every now and then I make mine active just so as I can throw rocks at it.
---
Oke so if rum makes you see things twice ... you should be good right?
---
Let me guess, you're one of the retards who thought renting was smart and now need rehoming
---
Step one: Get some Rum and drink it.
---
Step two: Practice your pirate voice, arrrr.
---
Step three: Invent a time machine.
---
Step four: Go back in time to pre 2009.
---
Step five: You are a pirate.

RIOT
---
You want to nerf local so YOU, as hunter, have more content?
---
So maybe to balance this we should nerf cynos, they are way too easy to use, and cause a lot of problems in low sec roams.
---
Honestly for smaller alliances, the Intel isn't that good, and people are fkin scared of any black ops roams (gokus and stuff)
---
They do, they get insane wrecking hits when fully spooled (that's an actual strategy in abyssal pvp, relying on wrecking hits to volley through huge active tanks and inflict armor/hull dmg)
---
And yes, the trig ships are strong, except for the damavik (and the vedmak, although good in abyssal pvp)
---
Honestly, you’re being too generous with this guy. I don’t think he’s going to make it to May at that rate :-).
---
The amount of people who I’ve seen come in there and say “I don’t give a fuck about how you think it should be done, I’m here now, we’re going to do it my way!” *cringe*
---
Sure mate, whatever.
---
I’ve actually had a newbie fragged one time. He would. not. fucking. listen. to a word I said. 
---
“Nope, that’s not how it works.”
---
- Um, you’re here two days, I’m here 9 years. I’m telling you that’s not how it works, it’s not an opinion
---
“Well, I don’t care! I should be able to [I forget what it was]"
---
- Alright. If you have to.
---
“Say, there’s a lot of police circling the gate. Can I shoot them?”
---
- This is EVE, you can do whatever you want...
---
“Hey, they shot back! My ship is totally destroyed! How do I get another one?”
---
- Not that I would recommend shooting Concord, because you’re always going to lose that fight, but you can do whatever you want.
---
I’ve no idea if he’s still there. I was ashamed for having encouraged him to shoot Concord, there appear to be limits to my patience that he knew how to find.
---
“It’s my space”, I’m going to randomly shake with laughter every time I think about that this week. Thanks [no sarcasm intended]!

---
but yes thats the old hardin he is in auz/tz now so he doesn't play as much as he used to (has a family etc) as always we get older and more shit to do.
---
Start with ninja looting/salvaging. It's very low risk/low reward/EXTREME annoying fun.
---
You make it sound like I am saying we are a "better alliance", I am not. I am saying when we need to throw Fexroxs at a citadel timer, PH gets better numbers. Therefore is better at doing the shit jobs.
---
PING REACTIONS OR RIOT
---
It must have been deleted from the archives!
---
The canes came later, I remember being so hyped when I finally got to be in a cane instead of a Rupture. Saved for ages to get it.
---
I'm not big into gas mining, is that even an alpha skill?
---
Well you journey isn't over yet if you're still playing! Happy to see you still around and good fights to you... Do you use TEXT fleets in SNUFF like Aralis used to in CVA? I hear they're due a comeback. Good AAR by the way.
---
Perhaps it has but he's only been around renters so there's no observable change?
---
"THE STARGATE DENIES YOU PERMISSION TO JUMP AT THE MOMENT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FIT THROUGH"

Pingsock emojis and some dude writing "KRAB TIME" on every ping, also the Komodo emote.
---
Your Mom's house.
---
&gt;They were planning to do X, so we're glad it died. You did us a favor.
---
I thought he said dense player populations would make it more expensive to maintain local
---
Don't you know? Gobbins is Hedliner's alt.
---
Bombing mechanics do involve some geometry so I thought it was about that
---
He isn't even on the test discord. Now, the DKS discord on the other hand has emotes still: Join DKS and you can pingsock seddow every time there is a fleet.
---
Yeah, I've been trying to push some kind of weekly / regular directed objective content since before the Agency existed.  Now that it does exist, there are so many easy ways to use it for FW things.
---
you can be elite and have fun at the same time, durr
---
Resource Wars, I think.  Another area of content that CCP implemented only to completely ignore.
---
Which would cause the tax rate to go up more

Just replace any of the faction modules with tech 2 ones. Note that this is for alpha. If you're omega and want to use tech 2 lasers, replace the tracking enhancer with a Photonic Upgraded Co-Processor because you'll need the CPU.

I dunno, it seems like FW has been abused to the max for years and CCP is just fine with it.

ok

Thanks for the info, will keep that in mind!

r/evejobs, or google any of the big null blocks, like brave, karmafleet, or pandemic horde.
---
me thinks OP has been a bit too much on reddit about two and a half years ago. that horde being slaves stuff was pretty blown up by test back when Tribute was invaded.
---
It has to be game breaking abusive for them to take note, nothing has been found so far and probably wont be. FW is a farmers game and nothing more for the foreseeable future as stated by CCP.

Also, apparently you can batphone your alt alliance :omegalul:

You guys asked for a translation so here it is. While I am a native speaker, often I will have no idea what a chinese EVE player is saying because I've only ever played on Tranquility...so I may mistranslate some parts but for the most part it should be pretty accurate. I'll also dive into some Chinese EVE terms so ya'll can learn a little bit about talking to a Chinese EVE player.
---
This video was posted to bilibili, a popular chinese video sharing site with the video title being: Winter Co.'s Industrial Arm visits Esoteria's all new high tech Science Park/Facilities. The description describes how often both sides form up only to see neither side fulfill an objective or how the author got a lung infection and is apologetic for decreased video qualities due to his sickness.
---
&gt;00:10. War continues to rage through the second and third weeks of April. With the exception of the accidental capture of TIKLE's iHub, neither Legacy nor Winter Co. (hereon referred to as WC) are able to make significant progress.   
---
&gt;00:24. Furthermore, with PGL claiming that WC is full of RMTers and peasants, we decided to visit Esoteria and experience the magnificence of the modern infrastructure and technology of Legacy.  
---
&gt;00:44. LG-RO2. Legacy Esoteria Economic Development Zone.  
---
&gt;01:41. The fish is cooked! (In chinese EVE terminology, Orcas are referred to as little fish and Rorqs are referred to as big fish. Furthermore, to fight and kill someone, or just get a kill in general, is referred to as "eating meat", ie. here saying that the fish is cooked means that the rorq has been properly seasoned and grilled and is ready to meet his fate in the underworld)  
---
&gt;03:24. After devouring tasty boiled fish, the WC fleet decides to head back home. However, Legacy decides that they can't let the enemy leave after losing this much face and feeding so much "meat", so the fight ensues...  
---
&gt;03:48. I burnt out my prop mod and one of my shields. feelsbadman  
---
&gt;03:58. Legacy appears with subcaps and caps and the whole shazam, leaving a bad taste in the WC fleet's mouth...  
---
&gt;05:08. Seeing the subcaps having a hard time against the combined force of Legacy's subcap and cap fleet, the FC decides to activate his trap card and log on the NINE Continent dreads that were logged off in Southern Esoteria a couple weeks ago.  
---
&gt;06:08. As subcaps continue to get alphaed off the field, Legacy, in its hospitality, deploys its supercap fleet including supercarriers and titans.  
---
&gt;06:44. Time to leave the battlefield!
---
PS. If you've interacted with a chinese eve player before, you'll sometimes notice them typing"666" in chat. Translated to chinese, this is usually a reaction to something cool, amazing, or awesome. So if someone links a komodo kill and you are impressed with it, you can type "666".
---
Well the beauty of c4s is the double static. If you have a c3 or c5 static you can easily roll the hole and run in rattles or Nestors.
---
OOS never sleeps, we r w8 for u BL
---
Lol.  No CTA.  Good catch though. Gf.  
---
Seconds away from being saved as well.  Live &amp; Learn.  o7
---
So now SP farms can also double as a way to tax enemy alliances, in addition to being cloaky campers? That doesn’t sound problematic at all
---
OOS vs Elo
---
who is the true ruler of Venal? Find out in the next episode of Dragonball Z!
---
Sentiment checks out.
---
Thank you, space friend
---
Sometimes I wish CCP would just listen to these people and implement the changes they are asking for, just to see what they demand next when they realize they have made things worse by asking for bs like this.
---
It's like people don't realize how their "amazing ideas" impact long-term gameplay.
---
The moment the risk/reward ratio is off, people will try to find safe havens to play the game. If those safe havens turn into more dangerous zones, people will leave as well, looking for more profitable regions, etc. 
---
In the end, people will just sit in Jita because station-trading will be the most rewarding thing to do because undocking will be a massive pita.
---
Anyone who thinks implementing more risks into the game will provide more content doesn't understand their prey aka content. There won't be anyone to hunt if leaving a station only causes frustration and losses.
---
The math checks out.
---
Even as a Signaleer, I'm impressed by but bright and beautifully read those killboards are.

---
Probably would not put that corp in FRAT though.
---
how about no to all of those
---
Unironically this
---
Fresh off the boat, not sure what episode
---
And no one ever tell Gobbins what to do.
---
Then again, that number is only slightly lower for the rest of /r/eve and the game in general
---
Certainly does.
---
whos joking? its silly to cry first amendment foul because of a discord config.
---
are those the only options? pretty sure i expressed myself pretty concisely. worst thing i said was pleb?
---
And the beans love you too.
---
Am I missing something. These bots all hole up if there's a neutral in system yes? Why don't a few people just stick some cloaky alts in the system and boom you've shut down their bottling in those systems.
---
Doesn't this sub complain about. Cloaky camping daily. Use it to your advantage. Fight fire with fire

Poor rainbow knights

Weird I click on it and it just pops up and says wormholer btw

that first t3c kill is kinda like watching a wildlife documentary, "tengus are the main source of nutrition for adult polarized drakes"

&gt;Jabber... [is a relic] of a dead era
---
The hell it is. Discord is wet trash in a smelly dumpster.
---
look out dude, that type of reasoning will get you down voted here xD 
---
\\/ case and point \\/
---
I’d recommend starting in a big nullsec alliance like Pandemic Horde or Brave and from there you can look around for more selective groups if that’s what you want
---
Honestly I'd stick a level 1 upgrade in there.  You wanna fix our ADMs *and* I can still come kill you whenever I feel like it?  Sure, I guess.
---
So let's call out the alliances and fc's who support this action? If botting in regions is so bad then it can be argued that those alliances and those that defend this activity are also responsible for it.
---
Calling upon the weasel Dran to get you freedoms is absolutely retarded.
---
what about a fundraiser for a computer chair?
---
Space owned by legacy coalition. Legacy is test, brave, kids with guns, and a couple other alliances. Their space includes catch, impass, esoteria, and a couple other regions.

Ugh, it's one thing to be new and reasonably ignorant. It's another to be new and an asshole. Your indirect suggestion to shoot Concord was warranted. They'll learn their lessons 1 by 1 haha. 
---
"How do I get a new one?" Had me chuckling in the middle of class. That's a failure at the most basic level lol.
---
He's probably just chipping away at some dark ochre in a Thorax with T1 lasers. But I have a feeling that his Corp lacks a buyback program, so he better supplement his income with a lot of Project Discovery. I would actually be in awe if he was still around after May. 
---
The last thing that guy in alliance said was "Why is there nothing for sale in my system?" To no response.
---
The mind boggles. Glad to create some laughs, thanks for yours too lol.
---
&gt; Oops! That page doesn’t exist or is private.
---
:(
---
you aren't the only person with brain folds, and your conclusion that people will flee any risk before they consider profit appears to have been created without using them
---
Speaking of relics. Hey querns.
---
Jokes aside, my point was more it has fallen out of favor, not that it is garbage. I still log into jabber every day, just not for EVE.
---
https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98583113/page/2/ 
---
Look at march 17 losses, he lost 8 VNI's to 1 Garmur cuz they malfunctioned on warpback and dont fight back in pvp. the 8 vni's cant get tackled and killed in totality by 1 garmur.
---
I have not done much with normal cynos to be fair, I am sure they are a bit of a menace in lowsec and might need some work around that play area.
---
I feel that Black ops is in a fair spot considering that they are expensive and extremely easy to f**k up. low projection range compared to titan bridges, relatively low tank for the bridger, expensive cyno ships (in comparison to normal cynos).
---
If local gets a system like this, cynos, and fleet projection might need to get looked over closely before it is balanced.
---
Waah? Pff, nah. No one would do such shit. Impossible.
---
What’s next? An aluminum tycoon supporting an alliance by himself?
---
Thanks for the reply. I did watch videos on the minigame, seems pretty cool.
---
In the video I watched, the guy playing said that his ship + fitting was about 100 million. I guess what I need to know is how to best get my first 100 million isk. High sec mining would take forever, and low sec mining is clearly too dangerous. 
---
Should I just be grinding security missions?
---
I think you'd be surprised, a reset on SP alone would be insanely influential on the shakeout of things for literal years in the absence of SP injectors. 
---
I also think you're fundamentally wrong about why 2004-2008 was so different. It's because we all sucked at the game. Even the best of us at the time was generally shit compared to your average skilled player now. There were still big alliances with even bigger coalitions. They were *marginally* more balkanized, I'll give you that, but it's not like it was some wild west for 80% of the sov map.
---
The only part I really completely agree with your assessment is the capital umbrella.
---
Never trust flairs on r/eve
---
You guys shoot your beans alot...
---
That's just communism in action
---
I mean you're totally wrong.
---
Theres a handful of roles in any fleet that should be filled by experienced players. Past that its pretty much a numbers game. 
---
You must be an f1 pusher acting like being a line member in eve is that fucking hard lmao.
---
Embellishment is the bread and butter of any writer, necessary to extract entertainment from otherwise dry sources.
---
It does, the discord has a large amount of pirates
---
Source is in English (I think).
---
A server reset would absolutely be cool, nobody likes the idea of starting new and either having to pay stupid amounts of money to be competitive with years older characters, or just accept that their characters will always be inferior.  That's just one reason it could be worth considering.
---
I'm sure plenty of people would be opposed on the basis of losing all their old characters and progress, so just make an alternate server that resets every two years or so.
---
How many spins are they up to? I assume this was the inspiration for the ship spin counter.
---
Also, “you spin me right round baby.” — CCP Chair
---
Well, why not just keep selling the others and take the venture off the market then?
---
If its stupid but works then it aint stupid
---
Lol you might want to read the tone of this thread before talkin shit
---
Made sense with bridges.  Does not with gates.  Hic point should stop you though.
---
&gt;I woke up this morning after having my hangover coffee from last night hangover
---
lol guys I drink alcohol lol I'm hip
---
Rainbow knights are just hk renters, glad to see them trying to find content
---
Its absolutely worth it. Play through the tutorial. Do the career missions. Take it slow and find one path to focus on and train for. Trying to do everything fast will only burn you out. And until you find your unique way if making dank isk pay for your sub with real money.
---
Not if halve of them also fly VNI's at the same time and react instantly
---
It is.
---
Just harvest gas.
---
and how are you supposed to know when the character will get banned so you know when to pull the XP?
---
Don't take shortcuts. Your choice of corp is about the most important decision you can make that will have a major influence on your attitude and playstyle. A bad corp can poison your enjoyment of EVE. Put in the effort to find a good one and you will thank yourself later.
---
And this is why it concerns me that Ghost said it would be cool. It makes it seem like the guy in charge of the new player experience doesn't understand the real appeal of the game.
---
Trying to "fix" local is nothing but a band-aid to deal with the symptoms of overall game mechanics. Nerfing or removing local won't solve the lack of content; it will make it worse, resulting in negative impact on the game's/community's long-term health.
---
If the risk/reward ratio is off and neither profits nor fun can motivate people to undock in less secure space, you create an incentive to seek out other, more secure regions to enjoy the game (best case) or leave EVE behind (worst case). Sure, any hardcore elite PvP EVE elitist will say that they couldn't care less about those pussies (aka their potential content) leaving because EVE is only for the very best pro gamers. I honestly would love to see how that works out when there is no one left to hunt, other than cloaky campers and their mom's alts.
---
Like it or not, people are risk-averse - the only reason to engage in risky content is the potential reward. If you make everything more risky but keep the rewards the same, people will ask themselves if their time invested into EVE is worth the effort. Even if you increase both the risks *and* rewards, people will still analyze their overall profits and change their playstyle (or leave the game) accordingly. Not everyone is a masochist.
---
You rely on PvE players to have something to do in-game - but at the same time you want to restrict those player's action radius, forcing them into certain behaviour that makes them "easier to hunt" - yet in reality even more difficult to hunt, because they will try to avoid losses. With the suggested changes you basically remove your own content. If the incentive to undock is reduced, who will provide you with content?
---
Oh, damn, right
---
it's literally free, so the only thing you waste is your time

No, sappo, that's the wanking hand, the other one is the iron fist.
---
Don't mix them up again ffs
---
Yeh, catching up is relative. Yeh the older players might have more options of what to fly, but you can train into a few ships pretty quickly and in quite a lot of ships it doesnt matter if the pilot is 6 months old or 16 years( apart from in pilot skill).
---
You can tell someone to do something, that doesn't mean they're A. going to do it right, B. going to do it at all. 
---
Things that seem trivial to you now (because you have the experience to know what's important to look for) can easily overwhelm a newbro. A newbro, if they haven't been guided properly, won't know where broadcasts can be found, won't know the different between "Approach", "Keep at range" or "Orbit", and has an itchy trigger finger in terms of cycling or pulsing modules.
---
dont tread on me
---
And Pike muninms. Test flies them but pretty much everyone uses them.
---
Almost like one is dependent on the other... Hmmmmmmmmm
---
Make a free account and then train skills while you read Reddit
---
Brave is allowed, if not encouraged, to react to pings and we're always happy to accept new corps.
---
^not ^a ^diplo ^btw
---
Ah cheers for letting me know. I'm sure he's a good bloke anyway too (apart from the SNUFF bit) :P
---
&gt; The same way legalized weed makes the majority of weed buying people stop buying illegal weed. 
---
Unless you live in city/region, then you go fuck yourself and continue only being able to buy online or from the illegal dispensaries.
---
If your friend is ratting with an armor/rail hyperion, you don't need to worry about what he thinks.
---
I haven't played in a long while but eve has always been about giving up something to be better at something else (disregarding capitals).
---
For example, unless you're pulling a troll, bait, or other very specific build, you don't multitank. You just don't do it. Because a single profile tank can be built to withstand more damage than a dual or triple profile tank.
---
The praxis can do everything, but it can't do anything well. It has a hard time being a battleship in pvp (pve it's fine).
---
We've established that omni tank is bad so the omni resists boost the ehp to equalize it to other battleships. It doesn't give it a huge advantage. 
---
It's not insured so it actually costs more than other hulls may.
---
It has less base raw hit points than the "attack" battleships. These battleships deal the most damage for their race, but have the least ehp than any other battleship of the same race.
---
Sure the praxis gets bonuses to all resists, but it pays for it other ways. The raw damage bonus is nice, but other races get that bonus plus something.
---
The abaddon gets a 35% racial damage bonus and the tank that the praxis gets on its armor (basically).
---
The drones suffer a smidgen but it isn't a drone boat.
---
The lower base health means it benefits less from rigs that boost any of that. 
---
Also it's slow as fuck. 
---
The powergrid is lower than all the battleships I looked at. 
---
I haven't actually played with a fitting tool to back the following claims up, but it seems my thoughts are going in the right direction. I'm not saying any of these things are impossible, I'm just saying that the praxis has a hard time for the reasons I state. 
---
Based on the mention of needing a lot of co processors, fitting launchers could be hard without giving up a lot of lows.
---
The ship actually has a decent to good cap amount, which means that energy weapons could be a good pick but iirc they use a lot of cpu.
---
Rails could be a choice as they aren't the worst on powergrid, but blasters are out because it's so fucking slow.
---
Artillery is out because it doesn't have the powergrid to fit what it needs, autocannons are out because there is little boosting their range and tracking, also its slow.
---
All that said a lot of this is mitigated under certain circumstances like treating a c3 or null.
---
How things are, it gets outclassed imo by most everything. It still is better than a rail/armor hyperion though lol.
---
If he's so obsessed with rails why not just use the rokh?
---
It's hard to know what the good one is before committing. I know EVE is a game with a lot of politics so people with say X is good, Y is bad but that's not always objective. I'm trying hard to find one that fits me but it's not easy
---
Logistics ships are the healers of Eve. Join a corp and train skills in logistics, you will be loved by your corp mates.
---
There are several support roles.  If you want to be a "healer" then you want to look at logistics ships.
---
Took you guys long enough.
---
My ideas for bonuses and penalties in regards to the declaring a side; if your declared side controls the system then that militia helps you fuel your structure (structure uses less fuel) as well as some impressive, possibly better than nullsec bonuses to service modules and rigs. 
---
As for penalties, hefty taxes per day or something that you don’t control the system or possibly have diamond rats attack the structure.
---
It will take some time to clean the smell from k3j
---
Sure it is!  In fact, something you'll find in this game that is absent in many others is that most of the commonalty, and most alliances, actually embrace new players, and help them get started in the right direction.
---
Yeah this is one of those ideas that’d be relatively easy because all it requires is a FW screen in the new Agency window as well as a mechanic to payout LP once objectives are met!
---
2 high quslity posts in as many days? wtf is going on around here !
---
Make sure you know how to play the game not just lances.
---
Geckos were always heavies until the subverted variant hit the scene.
---
If you wanna do pve "dungeons" look up incursions.
---
And some fuckers take advantage of new players, I still remember my first Newbro Corp, the mf had ventures for 20-25mil on contracts and was telling us to buy them and the price is because they’re fully fitted...
---
Let’s not talk about the JF tax, the low buy back prices, and like 20% ish overall tax? 
---
Just like that spastic Noori naaar or whatever his name is that tried starting an Eve cult and said he’d boycott CCP because pvp is allowed in hisec lol.
---
Cheers man - its nice to be remembered while sitting here in a pool of my own piss in the retirement home!  :) Really glad you guys are still going strong!
---
Sure, except you should understand the topic before writing it...
---
1) I always recommend that new players join the corporation **EVE University**. They will teach you everything you need to know to play the game.
---
2) As the others have said, you're looking to train into Logistics ships.
