Solo, trying to PLEX to stay in the game? Not recommended for everyone.

i didn't post about him tho did i

Ccp listens to goons because your guys have the most csm members. Kind of unfair.
---
Hahasex xD
---
When I was in WHs, C2 and C1 had HS statics, you could get a C3 with a C2 static and then hope that the C2 connected well to HS but if you picked a C3 with a C4 static to have higher ISK farms ... well then ... 
---

---
Could end up linked to a HS island a few times, get gate camped in Low Sec when trying to cross, etc.

Eve died [years back](https://i.imgur.com/xDqEP8i.png).

People are just starting to notice that the food on the tables at the wake is gone.

It's viable, but boring as fuck. Find a wormhole corp and get the most of it.
---
&gt; You can make insane isk **solo**
---
... and while you are solo, you are rolling, open a can of worms, get killed out of your WH and can't scan your way back in. Hopefully, you were wise enough to log an alt off in there.

It would create a lot of pingwarrior f1 stuff and stifle everything else we do

whatever helps you sleep at night. your statement sure sounds like you havent been there for WWB tho

I don't get it.

^^Seconded
---
The real damage is the lack of trust, the doubt that this puts in the minds of FCs. Those Eagles get replaced in a hour, but if it cost him a big fight, you've modified that FC's behavior, his confidence in his alliance, for the rest of his career with that group.
---
you mean world war bee?
---
Generally, Provi doesn't attack Low Sec unless they need resources, like moon-goo in the old days to build something.
---
Is it a hull tanked minmitar frig? I’ve heard that’s one of the big benefits of those minmatar missile boats, other than the drone damage bonuses.
---
You are doing it right.
---
Oh, I thought that was hands holding his ass and I was confused!
---
My corp let me be the guy that webs the freighter to warp it faster, great times.
---
The solution to cynos if you don't like them is to live, fight, and explore in w-space.

feel free to point out how what i said is wrong.

I'm thinking Horde. Spreading the love and peace of the one true son of Durotan, our Lord and Emperor Thrall to the humans, elves and dwarves.

---
Agree I like thx arty

You forgot the highsec part.
---
Nah, I tried making a fast frig with missiles, but It doesn’t go as fast as I’de like. Maybe I should get a destroyer instead and fill it with heavy cannons.

Here’s C5’s for like 3b an hour in true poverty fit dreads.

If only goonies butmad over freeport was limited to this , but its not. Goons have literally had a tantrum over all freeport structures. Go anywhere near thier space there are literally zero. Now once you passed the middle of the map suprise suddenly there are tons that people of all alliances factions and creeds used, till mittens got pouty and said no. I just find it lulz.
---
Yes, man im sure ncpl were raking it in with those freeport citadels. How will thier srp recover from the destruction of the mogul network.
---
I'm proud of you son
---
Provi high elves will enslave all those filthy Minmatar Orcs.
---
I'm glad you did this. Good work, mate. New pilots are the best pilots. Never forget that.
---
Why use a freeport structure in the south when you can just join the imperium and use better structures with a nicer market? The only reason there are any freeport structures at all is because they're near Jita.
---
Shoe, foot, enjoy.
---
Once again CCP murders the risk and pampers the reward.
---
PvE is hard
---
100% incorrect. You are spreading #FAKENEWS
---
Destroyers will be slower obviously....you’d probably like a stabbed though for fast and autocannons
---
I know this may suprise you but people other than goons exist in the game even in the south. There were plenty of freeport structures many jf jumps from jita.

1) rorqs get bonuses to shield reps when in siege, and you will be able to get far more tank out of shield boosting than passive tank. Particularly in combination with panic, rorqs can tank a very long time, and reps will give more EHP over that time than buffer. 
---
2) always fit a cap booster on any capital, most hunters will either bring neuts or focused void bombs. Also so you can inject up to jump cap. 
---
3) tank vs drone navs depends on likelihood of getting dropped on and what will be dropping. If you're in a safe area, drone navs will give you more ore. If you're more likely to get dropped, the extra tank could save your rorq.   
---
The scram advice is actually correct, I know people who take alts in procurers with many scrams fit in order to protect their excavators from being booshed
---
Wait -- is it minimal effort of "high effort?"
---
Keep your shit straight duder.
---
15 supercaps with limited triage umbrella vs 1 Titan with a fax umbrella near impossible to beat :thinking:  
---
I was on the reviving end of those 15 supercaps in 2016, but even I remember that it was the fear of supercaps, rather than the supercaps themselves that did damage 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
now you can delete an entire subcap fleet with 1 button, while under an umbrella that's impossible to beat without loosing more than it's worth
---
Effort is about the effort you put into your efforts. Some high, some lows. Just as with the effort we put into life, effort is what you make it. You get the effort out of the effort you put in.
---
They have the resources to do it, it's just not worth their while to spend time modelling stuff and keeping it up to date for a purely aesthetic feature that the majority of the game doesn't use or care about.
---
Fuck goons.
---
That belonged to NETC or other NCPL affiliated groups, sure.
---
Jesus Christ, are you a badly programmed bot, or do you have the memory of a goldfish?
---
Actually, pretty sure you were just weaned too soon, and really do need the attention.
---
This all started because you thought me typing a response to the OP was "high effort," and then *holy shit* by your standards you started running a marathon . . .
---
Man you're a baby back bitch lol. The systems I krabbed in were cloaky camped for damn near a year and I never lost a ship.
---
Small update but iirc btlh moves to c5-5 recentl
---
This thread is literally salt about the north
---
every reply you have send is salt about how people did bad things to you x years ago
---
but you do you, honestly people play the game the way they wan't, just don't take the moral high-ground when people call you out
---
* I was three years sober. 
---
* Fell off the wagon.
---
* Tried EVE on hard mode with an Alpha. 
---
* Found it easier than three years ago.
---
* Now I am using Reddit and the bitter vets here to help keep me off EVE, while I look for that better high.
---
No tank == best tank
---
2nd place: active hull tank
---
he got harrassed by that pshyco TD5K
---
( E)(3 )
---
Is maybe what you are looking for?
---
A standard marathon would be considered very high effort. A half marathon high effort. A 5k medium effort, a 100m low effort. Your high effort posting for low effort quality is equivalent to using marathon effort for 100m dash quality. Again, you get back the efforts you invest. Invest efforts with best intentions and your great results can come with low efforts over time.
---
T2 Ammunition and Module Production. . .all 3 characters trained for it, making 300M ISK a day 3 weeks a month. . .only have to log in for an hour or less a day to refresh jobs. I split my products between markets to avoid saturation, but my return on investment is pretty high, so I have some wiggle room.
---
You need a decent chunk of investment capital to get started though, to buy and research BPOs.
---
I supplement with roaming high-sec, low-sec, and wormhole exploration and L4 missions. I will probably look in to do some ninja gas harvesting.
---
I don't PvP very often, but I usually only stick around for fun 1v1 fights and don't engage unless someone wants to play.
---
Soft-shelled krab.
---
Cool, time to switch to Diablo now, after a couple of months try LoL, and by the fall, when Eve usually gets biggest updates, you will be ready... for a massive comeback! (Did I spell it correct?)
---
Gangolf is an outlier so the option is still well on the table
---
Have some serenity.
---
Actually a shame that Burning Crusade not released as part of it... Blood Elves...
---
It's not just a NAP, it's also just an ally except they reset for content. When legacy was threatened we all know who they called :P

For one I was trolling Scoots, secondly this happened like two years ago and the fact he kept these logs is proof of my mastery of the troll, third okay and?  I give you a cookie
---
Skill Injectors sealed EVEs fate
---
It an old niche spreadsheets/icons in space game released 16 years ago. . .it pales in comparison to Elite Dangerons, Star Citizen, and even No Man's Sky for many people.
---
On top of the subscription fee, only those who come for the nostalgia or know someone who plays will even think about playing with few exceptions.
---
FYI, I don't think Flaming Research was with anyone. DHSJ was bored so Pred decided to shoot the Fort. DHSJ guys calling people to come rastle n on the timer we ended up with a totally dank brawl. DHSJ are content generators and to be cherished.
---
I think it just depends on the time of day and if it is a weekend/day
---
That’s literally what I fucking said goon
---
EVE already has serious problems this game is 100% garbage and it'll just keep piling on unless CCP completely change how they approach EVE and magically get more devs and a community management team
---
 This game is basically in maintenance mode tbh..
---
Where would that go.. by a p i suppose. Pepfperoni?
---
We would become Serenity faster if we DIDN'T fight.
---
You literally just described NCPL again lol. They were the strongest because they had the biggest super fleet, and they got super pilot recruits because people wanted to join themselves to the safest largest group possible.
---
Double /nitpick
---
  
---
Long-range guns get -15% ROF.  
---
Short-range gun get +15% *Damage* per shot.
---
Let's not forget the PvE is mind numbingly boring with terrible ui for 2k19
---
Subscription fee isn't even a problem most people enjoy playing as alphas
---
Yeah I'd love to go back to a decent DAoC but I doubt it would ever be the same.  I've never played WoW so I suppose Classic would give me the experience of a Molten Core raid, but I don't think I care at all about that.
---
They've gone the way of Pen is Out. Truly a dark day.
---
Oh look this topic again
---
Replace China with Russia and your post is 6 years old
---
Goons got their asses kicked in WWB. They were beaten to point they would never recover. It is impossible for them to have made a recovery and kicked the shit out of everyone on their shit list.  Goons died out in Saranen.
---
How do I know all of this? Because I read it on Reddit as it happened.
---
I mean, I thought they kicked people for actually logging in.
---
You’re shit and deserve to be roasted.
---
No
---
You’d be surprised, a good 70% of my assets live in my WH and that’s the norm for most of the folks I play with.
---
God damn though nothing is more exciting than fighting an eviction where everything is on the line.
---
We play with live ammo in WH.
---
Yeah in the BR the only thing belonging to Flaming Research is the Fortizar itself...  
---
Since CVA somewhat fought to defend it it has been moved towards their side of killmails.
---
At least it's not that complicated to move this single thing around and check how the stats are without including it :D
---
GET OUT OF THE FIRE YOU MORON! -50 DKP!
---
You get get a cookie as well.
---
Lots of c5's are 'open', aka either totally empty or with useless krabs you could just buy out/evict casually. "Sell me your shit at 70% jita or I'm evicting you" is a line that worked really well when I needed to take bear holes for my old corp. 
---
c6's, there's a few you could evict, but the 'good' ones with effects are all taken by hk/hawks/novac/etc
---
When I was not in a big 0.0 alliance,  I used to run market scams in jita.
---
I still do, and I still get 2-4 people a year that fall for carbon/charon scams.
---
All of the isk doubles are too poor. I sent one a trillion and he sent it back because he couldn't afford to double it. I tried again and they never messaged me or sent it back so they probably quit the game.
---
The most interesting part of PVP was building the character to be honest, trying to math out the optimal build and playing it to see how it felt in combat for further adjustment. I spent something like 3 to 6 months planning the initial build of Maxisfix then played him for a month and did a full rebuild to get tunned just right for tower wars. Spent more credits for my TL5 than most maxed out TL7 pvp'ers would spend.  
---
There was some joy in breaking the rock-paper-scissors by pushing a concept further than people thought was possible and coming out with unexpected wins such as killing a maxed out pvp doctor or NT with a fixer. Still most of the battles were pre-decided if the players had similar skill levels and equipment, fixers could only occasionally over come that if RNG was also on their side.  
---
But there was always a noticeable difference between the players and their level of commitment which may not have been apparent if you were not extremely dedicated to pvp. Casuals were essentially powerless and extremely easy to wipe out en masse, cookie cutters could wipe out casuals almost as easily as the top end pvpers but would get destroyed by most top end pvpers of any class, and the top end pvper's were usually extremely dedicated to their build/knowing their own weaknesses/knowing the weaknesses of every other class.  
---
Since I specialized in tower wars my main goal was to wipe out as many casuals and cookie cutters as fast as possible, then hopefully still have enough resources remaining to fight another good pvper or work around them until I did. Fixers had many attacks that were on short cooldowns, so it was suited for attacking many weak targets but scaled badly for harder targets.
---
I'm on it too, so I guess I'm no better lol
---
This.
---
Prime time appears to be early NA time and afternoon EU time. So like from DT (7AM EDT) to like late afternoon my time.
---
This isn't going to be popular but the best thing CCP could do to bring back people and retain existing players is to introduce a replacement for L4 missions with a focus on making them fun and easy to add new ones and also still worth running. Key requirements would be that it's available in all areas of space, that it pays comparably to existing content in those areas, that it doesn't result in anyone being any safer than they are today, and that an intern can crank out new interesting content on a weekly basis or better.
---
One of the big things Eve is still lacking is something really fun to do between PvP and some sort of directed activity where personal initiative is less important in finding enjoyment.
---
He’ll be back once things calm down
---
Some did.  Those were called "bridging titans".  Likely people who likely didn't get to fire their DD on a hostile until UALX.
---
Doesn't change the fact that it was a powerful recruiting tool.
---
Nomad dread 3 dreads + a logistics/scanner run for a few hours and your paid off your investment. You can find an empty one, but that can be tedious searching
---
Oh I see now, explains a lot.  Hope to see you in my overview soon.
---
One of the most important things I learned more recently was to actually pay attention to the combat log appearing on the screen.
---
If there are a lot of "grazes" then consider changing strategy e.g. changing to longer range ammo and flying away, to reduce angular, or refit to include stasis webifier or target painter or better tracking.
---
If lots of "hits" or "smashes" then you could try orbit closer to reduce incoming damage.
---
Unpopular opinion:  reddit is blowing this out of proportion. Skillu is making a big deal to accelerate this over reaction.
---
they were literally down there in every fight bashing tapi's skull in up until very recently. What are you talking about

Just saying you could burn that spy at another time and get 100 sprinkles
---
Lived solo in a C2 with HS static,  no one ever took a shot at my astra. 
---
OP, if you have a few billion and an alt(it's a "requirement") time zone anchor your structure, like 4 eve time, on a Tuesday or Wednesday. Once it anchors make sure you have fuel in it and a clone bay. After that have fun. If you can make a billion or two you have broke even and if a random group decides to evict you you have made even money or more if you have continued to farm your home and more importantly your chain. 
---
If you have the startup isk and a second subbed account(for cloaky eyes and or hauling, utility, etc...) just do it.
---
Burned a clean sabre pilot toon on 10b of subcaps, what a waste.
---
You don’t need to be in a decent sized Corp to roll holes.
---
Because if im on vacation for a month and my group losses all their space while I am gone, I am not punished for their inability. Thus when I come back all my hardwork wasn't evaporated when I wasn't even around to play.  
---
That being said.
---
If you log in the day your shit blows up....then it should blow up. I don't know if CCP has the capacity to differentiate these things, but they should develop it....because you shouldn't get everything back just by letting shit blow up if you don't want to contest it, and have it automagically relocated for you. Either move your shit before the engagement happens, or eat the loss for not being able to defend it.
---
oh dear our victims are upset at us for having fun at their expense
---
better cancel the op boys
---
This is 100% true. Scanning and rolling wormholes in your hole and your statics, to make things saferish, will take a lot of your time but it is doable.
---
I've been playing since beta but mine just does a great job of sitting at the logon screen.
---
Null is where the pussy lords are at.

I live in a c1 with a hs static and a c2 static. Dont have any structures just live in my ship and suitcase it with a couple refits. 
---
Havent been logging much lately but mainly cause i like other games better. The social aspect of eve got old after awhile.
---
"I was just pretending to be retarded!"
---
if you need to ask, no
---
And I'm telling you that you're straight up wrong about Bastions. Nothing you can say will convince me otherwise short of showing me a video in a vanilla-effect hole with 3 dreads doing a 2 cycle Bastion.
---
i don't get it either.
---
You manage to blob a handful of standard fit kikis. Congrats. Now what is the message you want to send us with this post?
---
I didn't know this.  I wonder why reddit wouldn't sell the data even if you didn't delete it.
---
Yes.
---
Not trying to nit-pick, but the use of the word circumvent makes that sentence disagree with the rest of your post. If you replaced 'circumvent' with 'facilitate' or 'advance' I think the sentence says what you're intending it to.
---
Although multiple people reading one sentence and immediately goomba-posting defensively is really entertaining so maybe dont fix it lol

Confirmed Init - capping up when full cap, offline module that could have saved him from DD.

When my son was about 14 months old, these segments on Sesame Street were like crack cocaine for him. They are all burned into my memory and I try to forget.

i too am a retarded fk and must post on reddit about killing 3 kikis

Man, thats the beauty of a sandbox game. There is no right or wrong way to play it. As long as you enjoy what you do.

I love the Goons are starting to realize that true wealth in Eve doesn't come from mining.... Even more funny they're failing to find a way to stop something that has already been complete.... On top of all of this, they blame someone who hasn't been in PL in years hhahahahaahah
---
I loved Classic when it was current, but anyone that thinks it's going to be great for more than a few months is delusional.  I already did all of the content 15 years ago, why would I want to start over and put in 50+ hours a week to do the same thing again?
---
They probably wont anytime soon. Remember, all those sales happened during the year up to CCP being bought by Pearl Abyss, so they laid people off and put out a bunch of sales to boost their numbers...
---
The EVE Mogul structure drama is too good to ever pass up again, I doubt it will ever \~calm down\~ for them now after so much mad was generated. They could have kept quiet, kept their head down, but now we all know what lollipop lands of laughter awaits on the other side of EVE Mogul carcasses.
---
You can't generate this much sourpuss victom 'woeee is meee' shitlerism and not expect us to slip you on up to the top of priorities in "*things we really want to fuck with*".
---
Other than first person yeh sounds good.
---
Just like all of CCP's talent including the game director leaving in a very short period was "normal turnover".  Pretty sure most people on this forum will tell themselves anything to pretend EVE is in a great state.
---
You must have your head in the sand because these small groups more often than not answered to a higher power.
---
Have a lot of recons in your hangar, eh?
---
It's a weak meme from people who're still bitter that we made the obvious play after they tried to dogpile us. They got (and are continuing to get) their shit pushed in as a result, and the best they've got to fall back on is throwing shade at how they lost.
---
I wish you guys would realize this name makes it seem like Goons are the only thing that matter as it completely neglects reference to any one other than Goons.
---
Pretty much, a bunch of nerds think they'll be able to go back and play a 15 year old game that most hardcores have already completed and have it be just as magical long-term as it was back then.  Sure, it'll be great for a couple months, but realistically 95% of people are going to get tired of the same old crap pretty fast.  Esp when most things in Vanilla weren't hard, they were just tedious for the sake of being tedious.  Like, most of leveling involves autoattacking mobs to death with no real risk because you OOM in 20 seconds/have cooldowns on your 2 buttons, it just takes forever, but people act like it was the pinnacle of MMO leveling.
---
I wish your posting was an illusions, but it's not, and it's *that* bad.
---
We used to have to, to sell them.
---
I've been a part of 'invasion' groups, where people who were enemies in a game all cluster together into one group all from the same game. We all came from a game as treacherous as EVE too, there was legit bad blood between some of the people who were in the group together lol. 
---
Try setting up a discord and asking people to low-key advert it to their corps if interested, like dont spam it but you gotta essentially market it. But dont irritate people who  Setup channels, plan events for release time, plan crafting infrastructure and resources and stuff if you wanna go all out. And do it all on discord so everyone can be engaged while waiting for release. Make the whole thing EVE related and just dont let anyone make the group as a whole about their corp/alliance or whatever.
---
Nice thing about WoW too is you really dont have to worry too much about Awox/spy/trolls cause like no major asset loss in general. 
---
Anyway, I've never played EVE much or WoW actually lol. But itd still actually be really cool to me as a spectator  to see your idea come to fruition.
---

Don't project.

Honestly ships should land farther from the cyno the more you put through. So 10 dudes land in a small area while a fleet of 250 or more are im a say 50-100 km of the cyno. Maybe based on mass of ships similar to whs.
---
That's what most people think. Maybe a glorified skirmish FC? I mean you honestly cant think the upper leadership let's you anywhere near thier circle right...

I love that you think the majority of our income comes from mining. Seeing that, 3 years into the new industry meta, you guys are still so ignorant about how to properly play the game now is absolutely hilarious.

---
Cynos are kinda broken but I dont think nerfing them is the solution I think buffing inhibs and making the module itself harder to fit. Mabey even distanced based on mass after jumping would be good. spool up time is a hard sell cuz attacking with one needs to be instant to be effective. Or close to at least as most hunters use throw away cyno ships this tactic could change to brick tanked for spool up but in a BIG fleet they would just get alphaed. You would have to reinforce with cynos at a distance.
---
I would like to see the inhib set up time get buffed and its ehp. As a single carrier can kill them relatively easy.

no not really... you guys are the ones who keep complaining about goons winning - how about stop advertising for us lmao?
---
1985 was a long time ago.
---
To give you a quick answer. Subscription gives you access to more ships and skills that could give you an advantage over someone who doesn’t have them. Is it worth it? It depends on your definition. I enjoy it so I have 7 accounts subbed currently. 
---
As far as customization, you can buy ship skins but you can’t “make” a ship different model wise.
---
if self induced
---
Is Papa Sotken. This hole thread didnt answer that question ?????
---
So the free to play thing is like a dip your toes in the water trial. Don’t get me wrong you get access to many t1 ships and t2 weapon systems but your skills train at half speed. CCP will tell you that if you upgrade to omega you will train at 2x speed which is TECHNICALLY true but really that’s the speed we have all been training at forever. The alpha speed was halved. 
---
The game is not noob friendly if you try to jump in alone. Look on r/evejobs and find a corporation to fly with that can teach you the ropes. You’ll need it. Do not join a huge bull block to start. Find a close right nit group to help you learn how the game works.
---
They player base is big enough that you will always see people  in systems and in space. But if you live in the same area long enough you will get to know the locals.
---
There is t really a grind. Skills train in real time so your only grind is your time. And skills are training if you are at the computer or not.
---
The micro transactions are there if you want them. Be careful. It’s like crack. But not like being pushed from a dealer. Just like you can have it if you want it.
---
It’s not a trap. Eve is the most immersive game I have ever played. The content is the players that play it. You can literally do whatever you want. Kill whatever you want. Be whatever you want. Steal whatever you can. And backstab anyone who crosses you. 
---
So in eve everything is built by players. You will use ships that have been built by other players and then you will fit it how you want but you should ask the people you find to fly with to help you out with this. 
---
Is it worth. Well I have 4 subs. But it’s my hobby. My Corp mates are my friends. And Eve is my release when I get the kids in bed to relax while the wife watches keeping up with the Kardashian’s. The only one that can really know it’s worth is someone who has played it for a while.
---
I should add, I started playing in 2006. I took a break for a few years here and a few years there. But I always come back. And my accounts and my character are always still there waiting for that next adventure.

If we let the freeport structure our enemies use just live because they are "freeport" and there for the good of the game.  Why would our enemies ever anchor another structure other than a freeport since we would just let it live.

I've started playing again after a long break and here are a few questions:
---
* since level 5 missions are located in low sec, how can they be done? I assume those system are almost always camped by pvpers who prey on mission runners...
---
* I never figured out much use for my alts, but my wife wants to try the game. Does it make sense to have her use an alt of mine or should she use her own account? My account is Omega but she doesn't want to pay so she would be stuck at Alpha or use my alt...? What's better?
---
* my main character is a shield-tank specialist. I've been reading a bit on Incursions, as well as lv 4 'burner' missions, but it all seems to be about armor tank? What can I do with my shield tanking?
---
* about those 'burner' missions, the difficulty seems super hard, particularly as I cannot find a shield tank guide. Can they be done in teams? And since all my friends stopped playing the game, how do I go about finding help?
---
* I have a ton of Mechanical Datacores. Should I just sell them at Jita, or does it make more sense to try to use them for Invention? Long time ago when I tried a bit of industry I quickly gave up since all local stations where 'booked' for days or weeks in advance, has the system changed so you can actually try some production without spending ages to find a place to do it in? Also, isn't marked like glutted with everything anyway, and to sell anything you need to check price competition every 5 minutes?
---
* I am currently doing lv 4 missions in a command ship with a single tractor and salvager, but it seems a joke in efficiency compared to what I've read about re:speed running stuff. For isk making efficiency, should I stop bothering with shooting everything and salvaging it? And I guess a command ship is not the optimal platform...? BB would be better? (I fly Minmatar).
---
* lastly, I was thinking of doing some explorations, but I am worried about ending up in some super tough place where I am scrambled and loose my stuff, or end up pvp-ed suddenly. Any tips on how do distinguish safe explorations spots from deadly ones? I guess I can just explore a bit in cheap ship, but if I actually want to get serious, is it possible to do it solo or is joining a corp the only reasonable way for that?
---
Man you must not remember how upset the Republicans we're about Obama and he never did any of the truly dumb shit Trump has or ran his mouth like Trump. He was a milquetoast centrist and you fuckers treated him like the second coming of Stalin.
---
The north managed to survive somehow im sure the cfc can figure out how the fuck to do it lol.
---
It is a Dodo.
---
Extinct - Just like Galmil seem to be. :(
---
Pretty sure we were with goons during WWB  so im sure
---
and people like you are the reason the OP exists
---
So a freeport citidel where panfam could rebuild lost supers we camt hit because its mean lol suck it up buttercup when the boots on the other foot it sucks doesnt it
---
The irony is, everyone wants to shoot enemy ships. By goons taking their stance, they're effectively reducing their target size.
---
Flow on effect, less good fights.
---
Flow on effect, why play eve.
---
Do you feel like you may be a cunt though?
---
twinks that dont gain xp, epics that are actually....epic
---
I'll rephrase. It's laughable that the "industry meta" is the perceived best way to make ISK. I don't think you're truly applying yourself to comprehend what I'm saying. But do continue on to say "we don't get it" as you all attack an entity in highsec that was in PL 2 years ago claiming it's a source of our income.
---
There was a reason the "bankers" of WWB fit into Panfam so well. Nobody needed their money.
---
stop posting on reddit and go back to playing with your katana and fedora.
---
This is impressive and upvote worthy. Good job making that isk and being a self starter.
---
1: while an alpha, you only get to use up to battleship size ships, and no t2 ships. However, most of the fun is in these ships anyway, so it works.
---
2: It can be very unfriendly, but thats just the game in general. There are a lot of resources for new players to use, my favorite being Uniwiki
---
3: Absolutely. A physical book has been written about what the players have done in this game - if that's not enough to make it feel real I dont know what is
---
4: Depends on the grind you do. The easiest level of pve is boring as hell, but the harder stuff like Abyssal sites and DED complexes can actually be quite fun
---
5: There arent really microtransactions. There's PLEX, but you can buy that off other players with in game currency if you want, and everything you can buy with plex (besides Multiple Pilot Traning Certificates, extra game time, and Skill Extractors) is cosmetic
---
6: This game is harsh. There's scammers everywhere. The obvious ones are the isk doublers and contract scammers, but the more subtle ones are the "join my big bloc!" guys that end up pigeonholing new players into one playstyle
---
7: Very. You cant build your own ship hull (tech 3 cruisers being the exception - more on that later), but you can change around the fitting. This is stuff like what guns it has, its damage output and type, electronic warfare, speed, ect. Skins can also be applied for a cosmetic change.
---
8: Get the starter packs on sale first before you launch into a normal subscription. You get cool extra stuff. I would say its definitely worth it
---
While I would support this idea, I do see the immediate way around this is to chain cynos; the first ships jump/bridge in accurately, and light their cynos... then everyone else jumps into *those* right after. 
---
How do you resolve that? Is it even a problem? Would having a red jump-timer act like pre-existing mass work?
---
I've got no dog in this fight. Don't accuse people of things they're not doing.

CCP beats its chess and buffs and puffs at botters; but even the botters bring in the cash.
---
And the All Mighty Dollar rules. Since flesh payers are leaving EVE due to the constant nurffing of ships they said would never be nurfed; The re-emergence of skills never to be sold again.
---
I’ve been playing EVE since 2004 this scenario was predicted back in 2010. 
---
To make a long rant short; EVE use to be a game where time and dedication paid off on rewards and ship play styles. Now you can credit card and get instant gratification; and then instant boredom where other people them move on to other games and abandon eve.
---
o7 - Fly safe, live dangerously
---
I finally solved the problem at least for these early waves. It wont do a conduit but a praxis with a shield burst gnosis really does work.
---
And what else goes on this shit tier reddit other then garbage propaganda?
---
thanks chadders. Can you computer yet?
---
Well chaining would solve it but then you have to comit more cyno ships. Pair that with a harder to fit cyno and you might have none throw away cynos more often.
---
Fat Orange Nixon bad
---
So wrong... LoL

Sir this is a Wendy's

You can't really compare this game to any others you may know of. There really isn't a leveling system per say, or "gear" to collect.

Vanilla Serenity. This is botters chance to relive the domination of the server and it's death of content.
---
Init quit rather than follow it down, PL seems to move opping to low sec (npc citadels as storage eventually?) and going afk?
---
Guess still still wanna play or they might still pull an Init as a protest.
---
Goons are just happen to spin doctor it all as winning rather than being Blueballsed at the end(?) of the game. 
---
CCP already sold. They got PA's moneys
---
There's always a summer slump.

I feel that they have no way of knowing that given my only interactions with them haven't been cuntish
---
Oh yeah, would deffinetly build something as annoying as possible there. Permanent Christmas lights along with a couple of those Halloween decorations that pop up and start singing when you walk by. Oh and a durian tree.
---
I’m in a nullbloc, but I usually make my isk by exploring Catch in an astero. Right now the deployment is freeing up a lot of space for VNI ratting, so I’m doing that again, but when it ends, or if our new staging gets more people ratting in geminate, I’ll go back to doing that. The anom respawn time nerf is working as intended, I guess
---
Pure whataboutism. I thought those people were stupid then and I think the #resist crowd is stupid now.

Stop lying you absolute piece of shit. You either bought them youtself, took out a loan to buy them or you RMTd them. I'm willing to bet the last one because that's just how dumb I you are. No goon would ever lend you another at ship if they looked at your killboard and how hard you feed to lesser ships. You left of your own volition, nobody abandoned you. YOU abandoned amapd after you realized you couldn't pay Casper back. Stop lying you absolute waste of space pixels.

This year : ) , though so many haters, I ran out of cookies for them : (
---
Storytime???
---
The problem is that CCP's research (you can check that in of the Fanfest presentations about the NPE) has shown again and again that the average player typically moves from solo PVE to coop PVE to PVP.
---
Without offering a good PVE experience simply not enough players will stick around in Eve. Which is why CCP is investing so much in it.
---
There is a wrong way. Mining in high sec in blingy orca is the wrong way.
---
I dont? :D
---
link?
---
I think L A Z E R H A W K S is probably the most noob friendly. You really can't go wrong with any of the top 12-13.

Checked on other/main account. Notification feed is there but there's no hotkey listed on it to open it.
---
This. Is. A. Game.
---
A game where we are capitalistic, immortal, sociopathic, space gods. Stop.
---
I thought classic isn't out until August?
---
Or a blingy rorqual in nullsec
---
But man can thry dogpile like a pack of retards that herd a ice cream truck down the block.
---
I still believe the fundamental problem is the lack of piloting. 
---
I honestly don't line any change to cynos/jump-drives that amounts to 'prepare in advance'.
---
Is it legal to trade nudes for isk?  Asking for a friend...

Don't forget vaping and greeting women with *m"lady*

---
Why change one dysfunctional crap for another? :o
---
I very rarely play. Stealth bomber fits are only 80 to 200 mil depending on bling and if I die in fleet sometimes I get SRM when I die even if I don't ask for it. It's not hard if you never fly anything expensive. I think the most I ever spent from it was to buy a blingy Nemesis for incursions but I got bored of that quick and was able to resell everything for more than what I paid.
---
It's under the settings panel not the neocom.
---
But it does limit your future visions of expanding by not having one
---
I don't think they would say they quit but they definitely don't login to the game more than once every few months. I did ask someone outside the game if it was fine and they said they didn't care that they could make it back easily. Maybe mining is profitable? I'll never have the attention span to try it so I'll never know.
---
Not sure SC even can be said to exist.
---
Thanks, that was it. Not sure how that got disabled. But thanks. Maybe it was disabled by default dunno. Just started a new alpha.
---
Most people turn it off afaik, it's annoying and doesn't really do much.
---
-0.7 systems most of the time, sometimes moves into a -0.9
---
Keep in mind, the thing you do to make isk should be something you do while having fun.
---
A lot of the time I see people want to make isk *fast* doing something they **hate** so they can do something else. This is not exactly the right way to go about it in my opinion, and has led more than one person I knew to stop playing.
---
You don't *have to* be making isk hand over fist - just remember that.
---
No, he really isn't. Stop being a part of the problem.
---
I can send you corpses if that would satisfy you.
---
Maybe they wouldn't have to if goons wouldn't shoot all of their stuff
---
I slide it over onto the necocom and have most notifications off. Just wanted it on my alpha so I could keep track of what skills I trained instead of bothering to import to Evemon.
---
Wow, you are one hell of a bigot.
---
Lol Conoco, I spend the better part of 2mo on my first toon shooting at them in nullsec.
---
Some people take video games way the hell too seriously.
---
What the fuck is that?
---
This thread only makes sense for whalers and AUTZ.
---
Go back to WoW.
---
Oh wait.
---
A bigot for disliking dumb shits?
---
OP said he krab in a rattle. Maybe leprakonige uses Nestors. People have been using lots of krabshacks too. Who knows? :shrug:
---
or even worse.... in wormhole.
---
"solo how" because a group of players sharing a single structure seems like if you shared the upkeep that would be more profitable for all of you
---
I'm but a humble public supercap builder in high sec. I never signed up for this involuntary pvp. The goon war fleets should just do the ethical thing and move around my freeport citadels.
---
• level 5s are only in low and nullsec, you have to be careful to do them, but that’s the risk vs reward for you. 
---
If your wife wants to try the game, she could use one of your alts. It’ll put her ahead in skillpoints, but she won’t be able to choose her own things to do for herself.
---
I don’t know anything about burners, so I can’t help you there
---
If you wanna use the thingies for industry go ahead, i wouldn’t, because I don’t think it’s worth the time
---
Exploring isn’t exactly the most safe occupation. You will die, but you will make enough to offset those costs 100x over. Best ship IMO is a cheap heron. Fit a 5mn, relic/data core probe launcher 1, cloak, dual grav caps and stabs/nanos (or just do whatever floats your camel) you’ll be primarily looking for class 1-3 wormhole space systems, which connect to hisec regularly. Relic and databsites with a pirate faction name are safe.
---
The thing is, the higher the wormhole class is, the more likely it is to encounter others.
---
People love to live in C3 or higher class WHs.
---
But only very few bother to care for a C1.
---
So i can do my thing there with very rare to no disruption at all.
---
As i said, i live there alone only with my alts to generate passive income through PI.
---
In the meanwhile my main roams k-space doing all kinds of things.
---
Another thing is, that even if you find a wh you like, it is or was probably already occupied.
---
So you have to ask yourself "can i evict that?"
---
Even if the occupants are inactive you don't want their structures there. Destroying these is a very annoying process that requires some man power.
---
The only thing a sotiyo helps you expand into is super cap/super cap production because you can do everything else in much smaller cheaper structures.
---
Trump isn't the cause, he is the effect.  I dont hate Trump as much as I hate the scum bag people who voted for and support him.

That totally kills me. It was building up to something awesome and then they just completely shat on it.
---
It's much more than that if you get efficient at it and/or bling the fit.
---
Definitely playing it right. Now all you have to do is quit forever and you'll win the whole thing. 
---
Quit before all that is left is salt and bees.
---
Contract them to carthelan endare in 4-4 for 1mil per corpse

There are no comments because everyone is too busy having good fights in the simulator.

Should have gone with "if goons kill our structures then very sick children in russia will not be able to build supers anymore, WE'RE A CHARITY!"
---
Yeah and experience is highly recommend before going solo.
---
A closed-minded bigot for refusing to acknowledge the basic humanity of your ideological opponents.
---
I hope someday your heart isn't so clouded by hate.
---
You didn't need that first line. The last would have done.
---
Regardless of where you fall on the political spectrum, political bullshit doesn't belong in video games. Injecting politics actively ruins games and tears apart communities.
---
And a small group can’t have their own sotiyo to produce caps to sell on the open and free market? Let my man practice free enterprise
---
Can you send the referral link.  I am looking to join the game
---
Are you having fun? If yes you are doing it better than many.
---
You ever release another trading book?
---
Cmon we couldnt have done it without incompetent enemies
---
Too late to change anything, plus there's tons of delusional retards from goons and dinos who want to mine forever and are happy with the decline of a playerbase as that makes the game safer for them.
---
Dynamic resources maybe, so that you can mine your system dry. And revamp the ux/ui of the client. Make it easier to create a content for content creators. Etc etc.
---
Can neither confirm nor deny, but the God queen Ashy might be willing to bless us humble krabs with Nullsec roaming content.

Only for WoW classic guilds.

I don't care if you call them mouthbreathers or bloody rainbow unicorns. You are absolutely not at war with goons, yet alone in a war of annihilation.
---
&gt; If our leadership was retarded enough to antagonize goons into a sov war I'd fuck off to a wormhole because I wouldn't be able to get any content for months.
---
If content = 23/7 rorqual mining then yes. For anyone else it would be a rain of content.
---
Hell yeah.
---
I am looking to join the game.  How can I get the  750,000 skill points bonus ?

Why do you mix politics and EVE, and why the fuck should we care about your opinion on US politics in an international game, in fact coming from Iceland?

I often purposefully do it cuz I like to d-scan at the same time I probe scan, but I have never prematurely ejected combat or core probes of any variety.

SERENITY INC
---
Uhhh id like a uhhh #6
---
Well as long as you're not being cunty. Who knows.
---
The short answer is: you don't stay safe.
---
The long answer is: roll all the holes and don't scan the statics; in a C5 this gives you plenty of time to rat without a connection opening from your static into someone else's hole. In addition to this, keeping an eye on the sig list can help you tell if someone has rolled into you.
---
The next step is to rat with combat fits/refits so you can defend yourself. My ratting nestors have combat refits so I can quickly swap out modules and become a spider tanked perma point for whoever decides that the nestors are a juicy target. Call in your corp and brawl it out with the attackers for maximum fun.
---
1) free to play is a marketing bullshit term for "our trial accounts don't expire any more"
---
2) very friendly
---
3)  yes, in the very worst way possible
---
4) not very, if you can't be arsed to grind then just open your wallet.
---
5) not very, they're entirely optional since it's just for cosmetics or skipping a bit of waiting. despite what people say, there's no p2w here, that's why the micro transactions are tolerated 
---
6) probably.
---
7) you can buy a ship, fit whatever modules you want, and you can buy different paint jobs (SKINS) for it.
---
8) no idea, i've been a subscriber since it was subscription only.
---
Minings probably your worst bet. Abyssal stuff or Invasion stuff and its pretty easy to earn 2 bill a month with reasonable playtime.
---
You get dunked on by an NPC?

I miss your memes :P  
---
What happened to your victory over EVE?
---
For the past 6 years
---
I'm currently living in a C4 with C5/C2 statics, our C2 connection is into a great constellation as it generally has has a HS static. Works out great, for some reason everyone hates C4s and the mass limitations make it near impossible to evict without seeding (crossed fingers). 
---
It's a simple life but I enjoy it.
---
To answer your question I must first ask one of my own. Are you having fun? If yes you're doing it right. If no then no you are not doing it right.
---
♪ You can't take the sky from me. There's no place I can be. Since I've found Serenity But you can't take the sky from me. ♪
---
Why would we not shoot a tempting target so close to our own back yard? Come on now, seriously, PH, NC/PL etc would do the same thing if it meant goons had easier access for logistics to use freeported stations near their space.
---
Saying that, goons just drop 'fuck you' keepstars and totally circumvent the need of freeported structures.
---
TDS and ODS aren’t mutually exclusive.
---
They are not really surviving right now though are they? Thats the whole point, if you drop something or build something and claim ownership, be prepared to defend that ownership or to bend the knee to some other entity. It's how it has been for thousands of years of human history

By staying docked, obviously

not when they build it in space of a group that is openly and consistently hostile to us. Now had this been tried in a place like provi land or ethereum reach before panfam took it over maybe it would have been left alone under the pretense of being neutral
---
You're just mad I get more upvotes than you
---
right, because i've been flying supers and titans for the past 6 years or so, and NC/PL has been doing the heavy lifting. i seem to recall not so long ago in x47 it was NC's titans dying while defending that keepstar, not hordes. now if in 8 months they have bypassed nc in titan numbers go ahead and make that claim. but they havent.
---
The point of freeports is to allow smaller neutral entities to live in and near them. Goons dropping keepstars and Titans everywhere doesn’t make them unnecessary. It makes it so the only way to live in that area is to ally with other people who don’t like goons and can afford to lose structures, and the biggest group in that category is NCPL
---
Eve is becoming isk farming online and a lot of players don't like it and have left. You also are seeing a lot of older players finally just have had enough as they have done pretty much everything in the game and there isn't anything new to do and hasn't been for awhile. CCP has made things much to safe and refuses to let us freely kill stuff.
---
This doesn't seem to correctly read ammo in fits. I uploaded our doctrine Muninn and Eagle fits (from Pyfa using EFS format) to try some stuff out, but they both read 0 dps and no ammo in the cargo, despite both fits having full loadouts and ammo loaded in the guns and in the cargo. When I did get it to read, it would only read the T2 ammo.
---
I\`ll just say: "There are online games out there ... and there is EvE Online"!
---
Watch these trailers (in this order):  [This is EVE.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqoxRcP5kbo)  and  [This is REALLY EVE.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmS9vcVNr5A)
---
Yes
---
Yeh no.
---
&gt; allies
---
So "us". You're basically proving the point.
---
Thing is, those smaller, neutral entities, in the grand scheme of wars and content generation, don't matter. It sucks to say it but it's true. THey can never have the numbers to get shit done really unless they are an off shoot of null/ls part of a WH corp/alliance to obtain supers for hunting.
---
Yes there are really very few options for smaller groups to ally up with. THey are Test, Goons, NC/PL/PH, GoTG, Frat and the Russian bloc (sorry can't remember the name...Flame? Fire?). THese are also segrigated by TZ (Frat/GoTG), language (Frat, Russians) or your personal political bias with the rest (not saying they are all limited, all have options but thats the primary demographic of their members is all I'm saying here).
---
Humans have banded together from families to communities with the stronger taking control, which then band together with other villages and cities to make states then countries all the time the strongest takes charge. Democracy doesn't really enter into Eve so I'll leave voting and that shit out except for CSM. Basically I'm just saying people are attracted to entities that are stronger than them or that can provide what they are missing (content, resources, services etc). THese smaller groups will eventually coalesce into one of these groups or form their own eventually (plenty of space is open in ex Skill U space for example). THe safest bet is to Rent or blue up with one of the existing powers. Smaller groups simply can't last here now-a-days sadly
---
A Midmatar frigate. I need me one of those.
---
Yeah and every cyno alt ever
---
Loot from roaming is my only income. Also I'm poor.
---
So like a 1% of a 1% of stuff you can find in K space industry/reaction structures ... stuff that also drops.
---
they only need those supers to make isk to buy tractors to make bread to eat comrade.
---
hmmmm
---
Well I wouldn't blame them if they had reduced activity, what with their leadership getting banned for no reason and all that.
---
&gt;turn all the sov to NRDS and start enjoying the game
---
Mildly interesting solo/trio pve isn't.
---
Gas harvesting doesn't involve mining, so that can work.
---
yeah minin basically always sucks, either from money or from boring
---
His point still stands though. Rorq can get 1000dps with light drones and has a very balanced 9km3 drone bay because reasons.
---
I like the visual representation of turret traversal (and the related explanation of why titan Quad 3500s can actually hit subcaps), but I don't like how quickly you glossed over the hit chance formula and its two halves. I feel like that deserved more explanation than it got, because despite how weird and scary that formula is, it can be broken down and boiled out pretty well.
---
On a related point to that, it's worth noting that in practice nobody should need to try to do trigonometric calculations for angular and traversal velocity themselves, because the Overview has columns for both of them if you toggle them on. (And you can use the Angular column to eyeball your accuracy.)
---
Were the guns active when you exported the fits from pyfa?  
---
If so do you mind sharing the one of the fits and what you get when you export it?  
---
Feel free to change it first if you don't want to share the details.
---
I did a lot of nullsec stuff and enjoyed it. Probably would prefer roaming wormholes rather than living in one.
---
8v4 FUCKING ELITE MATE

I cant help but notice that your leviathan fit is wrong.  It needs battleship torp launchers, not capital torp launchers.
---
Obligatory, "You are my Reddit Queen, I don't want it"?
---
Man. My pedo cousin is the biggest Trump supporter I know. Fuck his basic humanity.
---
no you can run burners in hs. You can run burners in npc null for even more isk, but its slightly more dangerous, but since you are doing it in frigates, not that dangerous
---
That sounds like a you problem.
---
They pretty much are. TDS isn't a real thing. ODS was so much worse. It gave us the tea party. The useless lot of bigots that they are.
---
To be fair, as much as I can say shit about the Goons, it is understandable they go for your structures. 
---
You are in NCPL space, better safe tha;orry.
---
Na. Just Trump's base in action.
---
It's just summer time. Once the next PVE expansion hits in like October the new players will come. 
---
God I hope the new players come.
---
Ansiblex gates? There are hundreds of them now everywere.
---
&gt;and people like you are the reason the OP exists
---
Kinda necroing the thread..
---
But in all reality... if a capital injection of PLEX came into the game tomorrow in am effort to build a resistance,  what would that isk figure be?
---
Well, they could last, but goons keep destroying all the feeports.
---
Yeah guns were active and loaded. I will send you the EFS and a screenshot of what it shows in the sim.
---
Happy cake day.
---
And you are delusional beyond description. "Surely blizz will do it right this time" lmao alright
---
The trip to Lamaa was even better :))
---
Everything you've listed is part of everything I do, on top of running skill farms and doing capital / subcapital production, as well as some occasional jita market PvP. It's a bit hard to learn how to juggle absolutely everything at the same time, even across multiple toons, but once you get the hang of it, you can make a pretty penny.
---
It's an awesome game ! 
---
Completely different to anything I've ever played before. 
---
It has a difficult learning curve but it's worth it. 
---
Go to null sec ASAP. 
---
Get in fleet 
---
Get in comms 
---
Have fun

Big battles.

I've been playing off and on since 2010
---
Corporate doctrine aside, we actually stray quite far from the B274, sometimes two, maybe even three holes deep. Sometimes we even make it to the end of the chain.   
---
If you are receiving all your WiNGSPAN deliveries on the B274 then we do thank you for shortening our delivery routes and making things simpler for our newer agents, but you really should dive deeper yourself sometime to see the full extent of our delivery routes.
---
It's almost like the US is really polarized and no matter who gets elected or what policies are proposed, the other side is going to call them *LITERALLY* Hitler/Stalin. It's definitely never been as ludicrously over the top as it is right now though. I agree that repubs were deranged over Obama, but saying the left isn't deranged over Trump is just laughably delusional, and probably indicates that you are suffering from TDS.
---
they can't do that yet. many people use towers now to park their supers for example, even in nullsec empires you don't have KS in each system. Also, doesn't make sense to bring even a raitaru in a WH if you are a nomad and need to park some ships
---
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pay-to-win
---
&gt; Games that let you buy better gear or allow you to make better items then everyone else at a faster rate and then makes the game largely unbalanced even for people who have skill in the game without paying.
---
It literally is.
---
Wait, doesn't the word "recon" mean like quickly in and out, remain undetected etc.? So giving them siege type modules seems kinda weird to me...
---
If you really think their gameplay should be increased (I don't have a strong opinion on this really), than it should be concentrated more on the covert ops style of gameplay.
---
Join a null sec group. Mine some moons, 100 hours for omega. 25 hours per month after you first get omega. Getting a jackpot moon will heavily reduce that time. Mining more r64 will also reduce that time.
---
No, Init is part of the Imperium so the rest of the comment doesn't make any sense. I'm guessing they mean Skill urself
---
No it can't stand up against the rorq directly. You put combat probes on it and hit n run on the excavators.
---
And the drone bay thing was because they decided to make it so that the drones were too big to fit into non rorqual drone bay. It's remnant design that could stand to be redone.
---
Proof
---
This is the problem you encounter when 80% of the media outlets do a 3 year 24/7 smear campaign on people that have different opinions. You get deranged lunatics like this johnthebold2 that are so angry and feel so righteous about their cause that they have ceased to see their opposition as even human. It's a really, really irresponsible thing to do, to manipulate people like this, and it leads to terrorist acts like antifa smashing people in the heads with bike locks or shooting up republican congressional baseball games.
---
What a hypocrisy.
---
Its like the "Care4Kids" thing all over again:
---
"How dare you attacking our stuff, because we provide things to the ~community~"
---
So if I cherrypick some Obama voter who touched a kid and extrapolated that to imply that all Obama supporters are pedophiles, you'd agree, right? You're not intellectually dishonest, right?
---
Scam Citizen.

The only parallel is that both earth and TQ we currently have no alternative to.
---
So we can either blame it on the creators or the people currently in charge or try to make the future better.

“It was so much easier to blame it on *Them*. It was bleakly depressing to think that *They* were *Us*. If it was *Them*, then nothing was anyone's fault. If it was *us*, what did that make *Me*? After all, *I'm* one of *Us*. *I* must be. *I've* certainly never thought of myself as one of *Them*. No one ever thinks of themselves as one of *Them*. *We're* always one of *Us*. It's *Them* that do the bad things.”

Is it c2s with the dual static? One of those with a high sec static made logistics a lot less cancerous. 
---
And the logistics was what kinda fucked me off about wormholes. Which was a shame, because I genuinely think wormhole space is the most interesting area of eve to live in
---
I think one way to make this game alive is to make the Triglavians really do something meaningfull. This game really needs more PVE content even though the PVP people might shed a tear in rage. Maybe even go that far that make all the null NPC null, don't know how much that would help the matter, but atleast it would be really hard to make a blue donut in that case.
---
Pick where you want to live (LS / NS / NPC NS / WH) and then look at corps in evejobs or that you know from those regions.
---
- Check their killboard. When are they most active, what kind of PvP they are doing (large fleet, gate camping, roaming in nano ships, big armor fights etc)
---
- Check their recruitment policies (SP/alts requirement, main TZ, what they are advertising)
---
- Go and talk to them. Cost nothing.
---
is there any way of knowing when someone has started locking you up?
---
Well it probably is, but it require to much commitment if you have RL
---
• positive attitude
---
• exposes failiure
---
• respect the ennemy
---
• had fun
---
May you play EVE for a long ass time good sir. 
---
1v1 me at the sun.
---
&gt; smaller, neutral entities, in the grand scheme of wars and content generation, don't matter.
---
friendly tip, because i know it can be difficult to see past our own biases:
---
you having this opinion (the only thing that's relevant in eve is big wars) is a symptom of you buying the goon narrative wholesale
---
that narrative being, "the only thing that matters in eve is coalition-scale wars, and the objective that everyone should be working toward is building enough wealth to build enough titans to convincingly win that war"
---
at this point, the majority of people who subscribe to that line of thinking belong to goons or goons-lite (tapi). the remainder of eve is still a significant number of people who believe in different objectives, different end-game, different fun per hour metrics, and so on
---
so in short, if you're looking for evidence that rounding up 500 titans and burning down everyone else's space isn't everyone's concept of eve online endgame, consider this: no one has done it except you
---
Can't disagree.
---
The amount of scanning you need to do in wormholes really cuts in to your time spent actually doing things. And if that time is already limited by a busy irl  then it can be a bit rough.
---
or spend the few bucks on a subscription and not worry about earning your next month of gametime ingame.
---
then do what you want and not count every single ISK you "earn"
---
I've taken a look and found there's an actual bug here.  
---
Basically if the loaded ammo is T2 it will ignore any suitable T1 ammo in the cargo.  
---
If it's loaded with T1 ammo then it will work correctly with both T1 and T2 ammo.  
---
This only impacts the "Cargo Ammo Swaps" setting. If you leave the setting on "All Ammo Swaps Enabled" it will pick from the full selection regardless of the loaded ammo.  
---
Either way I should get out a fix within the next day.  
---
Thanks for the help tracking this one down, and please give me a yell if you find anything else that's playing up.
---
did i miss a fireside or something where mittani responded to jeronica using those exact words?
---
because i've seen this exact phrase like 9 times in this comment thread and line bees are not clever enough to come up with it on their own
---
So that means that all Obama supporters are rapists because my ex was an Obama guy, right?
---
He seems pretty intellectually dishonest, let's be real here.
---
if you re in wh that one is called the "instant enemy 2x full heavy neut rack ships summon button"
---
what's it like being one of pl's best posters
---
How so? Its not like SkillU actually did anything worthwhile besides renting out the dronelands... Sure, they did fight on occasions, they were at UALX, they helped FRAT etc but it seemed like they would try it for a few weeks and than just go back home. Ofc, I may be wrong as I don't have much info on the battles that are taking up in North atm or the small war in BOT territories recently.
---
Dehumanisation of your opponents is the first step to some really bad shit.
---
&gt;TDS isn't a real thing
---
And yet here you are.
---
you and me both, but that doesn't mean there aren't people who think that's compelling gameplay. we watch 3-4 supercaps a month sold on public contracts out of m-o, probably more on private
---
It's not bait, though. He reposted it. This person *genuinely believes this shit* and it's *insane*.
---
Hey, a broken clock is right twice a day.
---
Yeah, nah, that is not me (as you can see from this reddit account name)
---
You're either looking for newbros to gank or are a newbro about to be ganked yourself.
---
Either way, I wish you luck.
---
john selth and dj aldard are pl leadership?
---
lmao ok
---
Well people have been playing on vanilla on private servers years and years so I think it will last atleast few years. Especially if you look at the response it has been getting. I finally unsubbed wow during BFA but I'll get back to it while Classic launches and finish the Naxx this time.
---
okay you're retarded and i'm going to explain why
---
highsec players *build* supercaps there but they're under zero obligation to actually use the ships themselves. look at public contracts in m-o, count the number of supers sold
---
this would actually be fairly obvious if you weren't foaming at the mouth so hard it's covering your eyes
---
&gt;Is it c2s with the dual static?
---
C2s and C4s have dual statics, yes. And there's precisely five C4 systems with HS statics, most HS statics are in lower-class space.
---
&gt;And the logistics was what kinda fucked me off about wormholes.
---
TBH, logistics is my favourite part. I enjoy the fact that it's actually a *challenge* to get items to and from the market, instead of just being able to use a JF service. Having to run convoys and hold open holes is genuinely the best thing ever.
---
im not in a blob
---
are you sure that's not just because no one else wants you
---
Actually I don’t enjoy wars or fighting too much.  I prefer the management and inter Corp relations as well as future planning for my Corp.
---
I always find if your cold is managed well certain people can have their enjoyment of watching the machine run smoothly. Other people enjoy the game by blowing stuff up and swallowing narratives set by those in power, ion the other hand just enjoy watching everything work. I’ve made plans for my Corp that have spanned 3+ years, anchored a keepstar, built infrastructure for members to do what they want and enjoy. This is my version of Eve, the combat? I leave that to those that are good and better at it than I. 
---
Personally I don’t care for any real narrative and political bias even though I may have some. My dislike for NCPL Stems from getting evicted from Declan and losing our station that we dropped there as a Corp. It just so happens that the narrative is in line with my feelings not that I’m swallowing a narrative and blindly following it.
---
I agree the insane flights that we have at present are bad for the game. However due to the lack of any meaningful conflict drivers by the game developers this is just a natural progression. With the titan being able to be built in 26 days or so, not counting parts, and Delve being Delve, hardly any die vs how many get built. NCPL Had the same opportunity yet they didn’t take advantage of owning the north. We can go on and on about what if’s however their fragmentation of all northern entities after the goon defeat and infighting made large super fights go away.
---
It depends on how good you are at scanning. A good pilot can scan a sig in under a minute, and every sig gives you some sort of content. Be that content relic/data sites, sleeper sites, or more wormholes to explore. Compare that to null where you have to fly through large areas of virtually uninhabited space to find good content.
---
I think wormholes have pretty much the same amount of content as k-space, it's just that the time you spend looking for that content is more noticeable because you're actively doing something instead of passively searching.
---
the only way to have a sotiyo in goon space is to be in goons, and goons have a hard rule of no selling supercaps to neutrals or hostiles.
---
ncpl were willing to be flexible about that point while still ostensibly "protecting" the structures; that and m-o being in direct range of jita were large reasons that eve-mogul chose to set up in tribute.
---
these are not complicated, nuanced points, and the fact that you keep missing them is telling
---
but the whole war was about goons?! i was there gandalf, i was there 3000 years ago  
---
or to quote Ramsay: "YOU LIFE IN FUCKING DENIAL"
---
i love doing this its such a great way to scan and you just get such a close pass really its amazing  https://imgur.com/cWLufFK
---
It’s summertime it always goes down in summer
---
6 of them to be precise
---
and goons have no need to invade tribute
---
why are you doing it? because it's fun to play eve online in order to pursue larger goals
---
why do high sec players need a supercap production facility? because building supercaps is more rewarding than building cruisers to industry players
---
Good thing the population was small enough to recognise names.
---
As to building, I think I was the first one to work out the 5/5 robes on a fr00b.

The EFS scraper tries it's best to get the highest preforming fits off zkill from the last 3 months.

Unfortunately it sometimes does dumb things, like getting a Titan fit from a [horde loss in early April](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76028302/).

Fortunately you can easily add your own fits to fix the problem.

Then the rep the drones because apparently mining ships need 160km scimitar reps for reasons.
---
Because fuck NC, I've despised them since the day they were formed to fuck the coalition I was previously in, the REAL northern coalition. The chance to rampage through their space shooting everything showing their ticker is a dream come true.
---
at their absolute pinnacle, they were lesser pets of lumpy. now that lumpy is dead (and know your role just joined frat after skillu dissolved), all they have left is camping gates and being idiots

Looks like the specific site I tried it on was bugged. I've been ratting all day yesterday without any issues...

I don't know who you're referencing here, but that doesn't apply to either side.
---
And Legacy are the ones who held the field.  And the strategic objective was "does Legacy get a keepstar".  Whether it's the same keepstar or a different one doesn't really affect the strategic goal, only the isk war.  
---
Strategic Objective: Legacy  
---
Held the Field: Legacy  
---
Isk War: Honestly don't know, but close enough to not be substantial either way.  
---
Momentum and Morale: Legacy  - Most clearly evidenced by the North's immediate removal of their supers, and therefore their offensive.
---
Legacy won that battle.  I don't know what criteria you can possibly use to claim otherwise.
---
drone regions have been rental space since about a year after they were introduced my guy, it's all they're good for
---
they're much too far from everywhere else to be livable space for people who actually want to engage in active eve online content. the relative distance between oasa, for instance, and anyone who might want to actually undock a pvp ship, is a terrible penalty for any pvpers who want to live there, but a huge bonus for anyone who just wants to krab in peace
---
the story would be different if there were enough active players and sov-holding groups in eve online for the space to be contested, but even at peak player counts in 2011-2014, the drone regions were all russian renter space, because *the game never actually needed that much space*
---
the drone regions should have been closed back off after 2014, change my mind
---
Dual static c2. And the life in wormhole is waaaay funnier than nullsec. Even if you don't find anything really interesting the hour or so that you can be mapping the chain.

we need an ancilary hull repairer.

---
&gt; NCPL Had the same opportunity yet they didn’t take advantage of owning the north
---
my speculation is that this is because of two main reasons:
---
* most people in nc and pl specifically that would own a titan, already do. there was a push for people to buy second titans, but there were only a handful of takers, even at heavily subsidized costs  
---
* most people in nc and pl have been in a supercap war before, but are adults with responsibilities and obligations now as opposed to then, and simply don't have the time to commit to a 10-14 hour fight once a week over space that nobody really needs and structures that really aren't that expensive to just rebuild. in short, a large part of why we're not fighting is because we cbf to sit in 1% tidi for 9 hours over anything in tribute
---
My tank is my DPS.
---
You sound like you're having fun. Therefore, you're doing it wrong. If there's one thing that I've learned from r/eve during my few months of playing, it's that the game isn't fun.
---
can u @ me b4 u start using them so i can move over watashi no cyno thx
---
Maybe stop trying to show off about your AT collection and start paying casper back the ISK you owe him? It's a lovely way you treat "mates".
---
Its basically pay to win now because everyone has extra 2500$ to put in injectors and fly a Titan in a day.

Some further questions:

\-  Are there any other structures or methods that would allow for a simpler, more nomadic life? Like, are POS's still, errr, *pos*sible? (I noticed a Caldari Control Tower in a system I was in)  I'm really not looking to *own* the system, just squat there
---
\-  I'm thinking a C2 might provide a few outgates with options.  I'm not looking for total hole control and lockdown, as I'll effectively just be ninja'ing content from the hole and neighbouring systems.  Any reason why this wouldn't be a good idea?
---
\-  Should I look for certain effects?  Like, would Wolf Rayet be beginner friendly, or does it not really matter ultimately?
---
\-  Any tips for anchoring structures?  Is there a way to make deep safe, or off-grid placement of your accommodation?
---
I'm very much considering myself a space gypsy here.  Or a squatter, if you like!
---
You are not Amarrian. You had your chance. Now we grow and win and look at you? posting about WOW and scared to log in. You have let me down, you have let yourself down.
---
CVA is not Amarrian... they have long not been Amarrian or respected by anyone in Amarr. You are out of date. Amarr FW could take provi at this point.
---
because null is full of black ops, traps, and the worst: shit load of krabs
---
Remember to put a cyno on your frigate and have FAX fleet on standby to save you when getting blobbed.
---
EVE doesn't let you do any of that.
---
You can't buy better gear than people that don't buy plex. It also doesn't largely unbalance the game.
---
Remember, that ISK is coming from players who made it elsewhere in game. The high price of plex means people are making lots of money elsewhere.
---
So, not only can you not read, you don't understand EVE, and still don't understand pay-to-win.

are u ok
---
We had a C4 static C3/C2 with my first corp.  
---
Lots of newbros but some knowledge about WH thank to a previous experience.  
---
It was exactly what we needed : good isk, easy logistics, small or medium pvp (away from C5 big boys)
---
then we grow up a bit and trade our C3 static for a C5.
---
So, what you’re saying is that a player who spends 98% of their time in high-sec, mining or doing whatever, who then travels into scary null-sec to either achieve a goal they set, or to build a product that can make them significant profit; isn’t a high-sec player? So if i got this right, you’re a wormholer, because of that one time you used a wormhole during a fleet 3 years ago.
---
The fastest way to spawn wandering holes is to roll your statics and start mining.
---
&gt;With the PLEX for ISK paradigm players no longer have to do that.
---
This isn't true.
---
Plex do not generate ISK. Players still need to be earning ISK in game. That's the only way for ISK to enter the economy.
---
With war on the table in north and south, a lot of "farmer" just don't connect and wait the end.  So i think the decline is less thant 17%, but yes it decline.
---
I'd honestly recommend to join up with a WH Corp! If you want to do ratting + PvP this is probably the best way. You have backup, friends to fly with and have a hole to ratt in right next door.
---
You just made yourself look like a pure loser bitter mad vet of no value.... try to have fun loser, its a game.
---
No one shut you out, you left amapd under your own steam.
---
On your overview. Whoever is locking your ship will have a new set of flashing brackets around the little icon that designates ship size. The new flashing brackets will be one of two colors. Yellow flashing means they are currently attempting to lock you, whereas red flashing means the are currently locked onto you. This is where the terms "yellow boxing" and "red boxed" come from.
---
Agreed, Krab people taste like krab.
---
I am sugesting you start to spend effort when you choose target under umbrella. 
---
People want nerf without thinking of all consequence of a nerf just to make they have kill mail.  If you change cyno you need to change a lot of other thing. 
---
If you want counter an umbrella ask people who successfull hunt inside delve with umbrella up. They will explain the risk/reward/effort.
---
galmil today:
---
&gt; Hoping for a healthy and alive warzone! 
---
galmil a year and a bit ago:
---
&gt;oh shit calmil getting serious better batphone snuff to all our defenses!!
---
There are only two types of Capsuleers: The Ganker and The Ganked. So sayeth Bob, hallowed be his name.
---
Ask an auto win button, it will be faster than making a shitons of post.
---
Jam local =&gt; you have WH for that
---
Arazu =&gt; You already have ship who could be invisible on dscan
---
Rapier =&gt; You can fit modulle to scan faster and better
---
Pilgrim =&gt; If you want change cyno without killing eve actually you need to change a lot more thing. 
---
3 of 4 role already exist... Congrats to proof you don't know the game mechanics !
---
Very good, more bots to hunt and loot to get.
---
yeah, most in here sound like my old eve friends
---
Well, yeah. But my point was that there were 5 C4s with HS statics.       
---
And living in a shattered hole is eminently doable, it's just about the most difficult space possible to live in which makes for a nice challenge.
---
I would personally recommend living in a c13
---
So you want to disrupt effort of active player who make intel, and disrupt all kind of effort from defender. YOu want less risk for hunter and bigger reward for they.  
---
I have a better sugestion for you : Learn to hunt.
---
The worst idea is you're cyno one on other post.
---
Yup, I feel way more scared flying in high sec then I ever do roaming in 0,0.   
---
Thats EVE for you
---
I thought scanning down and warping to the new static does not open it unless you jump through it?
---
Star Citizen is barely even a game yet and apparently Eve pales in comparison. Okay.
---
Not sure how active incursions are anymore, but both incursions and trig invasions should be a decent way to have content for an unused logi pilot and make isk.
---
No  
---
yellow box mean you are fully targeted. You see nothing durring the targeting process. (try it with an alt and some warp core stab or damp to have the time to see it).  
---
you are red boxed when someone do something agressiv against you: guns, distrubtor, neut etc...
---
Unless you fly dreads and got corp sized 30+ active characters, C4s with C4/C2 s are best, daily pvp content with good ratting opportunities
---
I stream, for some reason people keep giving me idk. I thinks it's my massive knockers.
---
&gt; I heard a lot about how unsafe it is supposed to be. Like how people would hunt you down and blast the ever living crap out of you for luls with big ass ships.
---
This sounds like lies that risk averse highsec carebears tell themselves so they can pretend to be morally superior to the lawless and savage nullseccers.
---
Why is the concept that Test military leadership might be good at internet spaceships so offensive?
---
You are completely right. Not quite sure why i couldnt remeber that. Though i am just returning myself
---
well, there is only one way to counter this. Let's do daily nano fleets to hunt bots, anchoring drag bubbles in their systems, or even better, setting up a cloaky guy in each system there.  Even a ceptor fleet will do the job.
---
Nice idea to kill Eve.
---
Eve is eve beacause server has is own history. A lot of people who actually cry are just people who want easy kill mail, like NCPL against braves years ago. 
---
If you split server you will juste kill game.
---
Aaaah un bon petit merge avec 24 fichiers en conflit dont des scripts et des fichiers avec 22+ conflits à l'intérieur.
---
Rien de mieux de bon matin.
---
You sound like every Eve video from 2009
---
for the swarm.
---
I agree with your more or less. Not just PvP, but logistically you really need to be allied with neighboring regions to get out there. I was mostly just stating that no matter what space they dropped, I wouldn't have been interested because the nullsec political/power scale is absolutely royally fucked.
---
I look forward to another year in which the CSM help CCP focus on the important aspects of eve.
---
Hope tank best tank. Just hope, no one shoots at you. 
---
+25% bonus if thoughts and prayers apply.
---
In fact true problem is not this or this alliance leaving.
---
The true problem is the fact enx player don't come.
---
Eve work with a system who make you need nice number of player to work. But actually the number is not that hight, and it will continue to decrease...
---
Newro are bad and give nice KM to people with more experience, so they create more content, people who farm newbro are farm by bigger fish and bigger fish.
---
Remimber when brave go to catch years ago ? This amount of fight everywhere ? Only beacause a shitons of newbro move. 
---
Become serenity is not the true problem, really if a coalition conquer the whole 0.0 congrats. All other player of the game could attack area by area to fall the coalition... But for that they will need fresh blood.
---
Cute argument bro. I hate all Republicans not just Trump.
---
Well I can totally understand that reasoning. I'm in the same boat and it's why I have gravitated to the 'empire building' aspect of eve rather than the blowing shit up route. I just like to plan and watch it work out. I've been playing since 2007 with breaks here and there, I'm no longer a student like I was in '07, I run my own company and thus have hardly any time to dedicate to the slug fest TiDi fights even though I have the ships and alts that can. I'm literally like you guys, no time nor desire to do those long slogs and happy to read and watch about it later on or take part in little skirmishes in outer systems of the main fights in subs so I can do a runner if I need to and not loose anything important.
---
    
---
Thing with GSF vs NC/PL is we openly recruited to get more fresh blood willing and able to sit through TiDi bore fests where as it seems, from the outside looking in, that NC/PL kept their isolationist outlook and wanted to keep their 'we are beter than you because we have standards' outlook. Horde seems, again from the outside looking in, to of gone well due to it's recruitment policy (it's easy to get a 5 minute old awox alt into Horde on an obvioulsy Goon main account). They have a constant influx of fresh keen pilots to motivate and keep that motivation rolling (like we do with Karma, Ascee etc) and keep new people involved in 'babies first battleship fleet!' 'babies first carrier!' etc. Celebrating milestones with members makes the group fresh, rather than 'i can grind out another titan in the north, but I don't have the motivation to actually use it, fuck it I'm playing XYZ game'. I can totally understand that thought as I have it myself at times. I COULD mine out another titan, I COULD go super or titan ratting...but what for? Build another? Build a keepstar? Get a faction titan that I most likely will never use?
---
Sad but true
---
Actually the article is all about SP farming being profitable by 2-300million per month right now. I included that some people have hoarded PLEX.
---
Sounds like a fun little enterprise. Thanks for the writeup. I'll keep an eye out for future posts!
---
That's a big word for a dumb fuck Trump stain.
---
Isnt fcon dead ?
---
Heaven forbid someone express an opinion that breaks from a narrative, lol.
---
We already got a pve expansion and its garbage lol
---
Solo as in 1 character? Or muliboxing?
---
You won't really be living with just one character. It would just be a safari
---
well, it seems you moved to botting space or ended up in an alliance who is deployed right now so homebase is kinda empty. Don't know about you, but in Fountain we get content every day.
---
I would sound the retreat, but you know, i'm not sure if we have access to the forts on the way back.
---
Because winning is fun? Legacy and the Imperium sure seemed more then willing to go into that again and again.
---
Na. Obama never walked in on some teenage girls when he was middle aged. Can't say the same about President Cheeto
---
Wow, you seem to be pretty salty, aren't you ?
---
So you despite what you call the "fake northern coalition" because you were, according to you, previously in the "real" one, so you joined goons.
---
Cannot compute, argument is too stupid.
---
Yeah and then you get to see what grown adults look like when they cry when you go against a Mono Red Aggro deck 3 games in a row.
---
And build a freighter and keepstar in the hole so you're invincible
---
Think it's about time Shittani kickstarted another SciFi Fantasy book like he tried to last time.  That or he could go out to a couple of larps and get his "rub on" going again.
---
yes, but you can only die if you were once alive like fcon or rzr
---
unlike tnt
---
Yup, sounds good
---
The higher the amount of isk in space, and the lower the available dps, the higher the rate of wandering hole spawn.
---
My point is that paying for and advantage is what the term "pay to win" refers to, and that buying isk with plex you bought with cash is paying cash for and advantage.
---
It definitely unbalances the game but it may be as notable as in other games due to eves asymmetrical nature.
---
The only really arguable thing here is if it "largely" unbalances the game.
---
&gt; You can't buy better gear than people that don't buy plex.
---
The upper limit is the same, I'll give you that, but most people aren't playing at the upper limit, so price is a notable factor.
---
Yep, ratting in supers. Which is more encouragement for new players to pay (cash) to get into a super so they can be rich (in isk) forever...
---
1v1 me at the sun:
---
We'll both take 1 day old characters and see if whoever paid for and advantage made the contest "largely unbalanced"
---
yeah i always forget about logistics, just like everyone else in eve that doesn't do logistics i suppose
---
but oasa and cobalt being as remote as they are means you really need to be friends with the people in front of you; much simpler to just have the same entity control the whole thing
---
i know people who had 10.. 20... 30+ active account but with in the increase in plex prices they have reduced the accounts down. 
---
I think you will find that the amount of active PC players behind screen is not that much different than it was this time last year... just less alts online strip mining entire colossals
---
if you think a freeport sotiyo in provi wouldn't be killed immediately by htp or one in etherium wouldn't have been killed by horde, the same as a freeport anything in aridia gets killed by goons, you're deluding yourself
---
Read me again. You did that you wanted. I dont care.
---
I wasnt crying at this time like you are now.
---
They fucking sound like Umbridge from Harry Potter.
---
I did it for weeks and loved it, just kept a toon logged off in a dst and logged him in when I needed to grab something or store something
---
10/10 would recommend living in a shattered
---
He gave explanation why he did it.
---
You guys had a good idea and it would have lived (if it were a shield super...) had you not jumped into bed with NC./PL. .
---
Same with the Northern LowSec Keepstars, they would have lived too but then wouldn't have been allowed to live by NC./PL. if they allowed everyone.
---
It was a catch 22 really and as far as I know from people in goons they had no docking rights to your stuff in the north (not sure if they did anywhere else?).
---
15 years you mean...
---
Panfam: the blue donut is killing Eve!
---
Also panfam: Why are you stupid Goonies killing neural citadels in a region you are actively invading. Grrrr goons!
---
Panfam: the super capital blob is killing the game!
---
Also panfam: Why are you killing an organisation that lets random highsec pubbies build supercaps in our space. Grrrr goons!
---
Can you guys stick to a narrative please?
---
Not in it for that long ~
---
For the most part it hasn't been new players that have benefitted from skill injectors. It's been certain nullsec alliances that have been able to buy themselves almost instantly, an unrivalled supercapital fleet that have benefited the most.
---
regarding the open recruitment and standards question, it's less about achieving the ability to compete with goons and more about preferred gameplay style
---
ncdot likes being a large blob and their recruitment policy reflects that, although they prefer not to be a training organization, and keeping recruitment somewhat selective makes it moderately difficult to get spies in without some dedication
---
pl doesn't really subscribe to that gameplay. we *can* do that, and we regularly do because that's kind of the state of eve, but we prefer rolling around in ~100 man fleets and fucking shit up over actually making concerted pushes on objectives and conquering space
---
while it's true that you do need more people to compete with the fleet sizes in modern eve, you only need that if you want to compete in the political meta against goons, and we kinda don't
---
this post is hilariously poorly informed
---
I'm in, my alliance already hunt bots in detorid quite a bit.
---
&gt; I responded to the other one.
---
I responded to the other one.
---
This is me, haven't played since 2010 and just joined again because I work with a guy who plays
---
You could make a frigate alt into FW and use that to get 100m/h.
---
That's understandable. CCP really screwed the pooch with their changes to the game (Sov, cyno jammers, jump fatigue et al) and ruined the game for many people. Whilst I would love to go back to the chaos of those days sadly it's a case of adapt or die. I just wish more people adapted rather than try to be top dog whilst letting others adapt and slowly overtake everyone. 
---
Being in Goons is great fun, but the disadvantage is eventually we will have no content due to everyone getting crushed or us blueing every motherfucker in the game. It's sad and annoying but it is what it is
---
Well you get to add these to the numbers....

At least you're open about your bigotry
---
Bigger words than you're using
---
Which is why i said "even a month ago". Now its a slightly different story, although isk per hour still isnt brilliant.
---
Here is the Quote from the article that i have an issue with because it mixes plex price speculation with sp farming:
---
"SP farmers have been hoarding PLEX for a long time. So when they extract they could be using PLEX they bought 2 years ago at 2.5million per plex and using those to buy extractors. It is a completely different ball game."
---
It is not though. No sp farmer in their right minds would go though the hustle of extracting sp if all the Profit comes from the plex increase alone
---
I don't always undock but when I do...
---
... I lose VNIs to npcs and brag on reddit about blobbing some roaming NC. kikis.
---
Once I get home you get them. But need to pick up in Jita
---
You're so hot right now. Sold
---
5-5
---
Rolling with a cap is amazing.
---
What would I use it for? Pvp. Ez.
---
C3 with a null static, no one really wants them but it’s great for roaming null and you can make decent isk doing a little pve or setting up PI.
---
do that for years, git guud at it.
---
scream in local about how amazing you are for 1year
---
post 3 shit videos on youtube of your pvp spreadsheets
---
join nullbloc/lowsec powerhouse
---
stay docked, play dota 2 and await pings.
---
Is there a way to get a more detailed log of what's happening?
---
According to the simulator 10 Sleipnirs can't break a Vagabond. Even with that Pith X-Type XL Booster on the Vaga fit they should be able to.
---
Depends on what you expect from it.   
---
You could settle a c1/ns with a single account - just have a scanner/exploration/holder and a main toon with a t3c.   
---
Do scanning/explo in ns/incoming holes, run combat sites/escalations or gank in ns with your main.
---
Live out of giant containers/mobile depot.
---
Just possibly they decided to restage to somewhere they could do better than procurers and thrashers
---
&gt;c1 with a hs static and a c2 static
---
no
---
Yes so industrious that every trip through their space shows automated ships everywhere!
---
I lol'd but tbh amamake is hot again for lowsec action, lots going on in and aroudn currently.

For 1mil each you get two senteces of erotic litera to each of your corpses

Oh I don't even need any extra. I just need the meat please

Must be boring to grind structures, they have to come to reddit for content
---
They got unbanned ages ago
---
&gt; how to properly play the game
---
Not that I disagree on what's optimal to be the strongest entity in the game, but who is telling you that they want to play the mega empire game if it means being mining more rocks than shooting people ?
---
post from ur pl main

Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Wrong, that is the best way to put the final nail in the coffin. CCP can not make PvE fun EVER. This is because the actual combat in Eve is pretty dull. Look at abyssal content, it the same shitty combat spiced up with a fish eye camera and a site timer.  The PvP aspect adds the fun, trying to hunt, bait counter what the other player brings, ect. PvE in this game is just a means to and end, it can not and never will be good action based combat.
---
Markeedragon has alot of good guides on YouTube also livesstreams.  There's a endless sea of guides on YouTube.  Just depends what your into.  Also I think there are some pretty good sites like Eve wiki and Eve University that are very helpful.  Welcome to Eve it's addictive.
---
Sure
---
They're not Freeport if Goons can't dock.
---
Lol, can't tell if serious.
---
Ok?
---
OP mentions running missions, so it's probably not sov null
---
instead of cyno lighters, why not simply jump generation timer ?   
---
you would have to cast the jump, further you go, longer the preparation time is.
---
CCP gets my money for 2 accounts since 2007, 3rd acc since 2009.
---
I never had to worry about my gametime, I would consider this as an awful 2nd job ...
---
Watch clear skies everything is explained in that.
---
I havent checked out the bios yet but i guess ill try it out if i find something
---
No need for a tank if the target is dead.
---
&gt; Incursions are neither easily accessible nor reliable in repetition
---
Thanks, that is exactly what I said  ;-P
---
&gt; yet I've found them more boring than anoms
---
If you do not like interacting with other people, well than Anoms is the one of the two similarly boring activities. Don't get me wrong both are numb grinding, but in Incursions you meet other people and actually do stuff with them.
---
Injectors, bots, plex prices, and dead game.
---
The mighty beans and competency.... They get a A× for trying and they are active at least.
---
No. Game was as dead three months ago.
---
I do have nearly functional internet these days. Sometimes if the wind blows right I can get broadband speeds.
---
I'd recommend watch videos of guides, not reading them.
---
The way to know for sure is to see what the tax rates are for Panfam jobs vs the general public...
---
Anyone have that info?
---
Yes. Continue to do the good work!
---
Good lord the cringe
---
I have the right drivers. i updated my radeon software to adrenalin which updated my drivers to the latest versions hoping it will fix something out but naahhh so i tried updating the drivers in device manager because upadate was available (weird because i updated to adrenalin ver. already in radeon software) THEN i noticed that it DEGRADED the version back to laptop version which is weirder.. and no my amd software doesnt have that option it just says "switchable graphics" which i already tried to set eve to high performance but naaaahhh.. because of this im losing motivation to play eve :&lt;
---
Pretty sure goons started out being able to dock but then suprise they broke the rules and attacked them.
---
wew, some fresh air could help maybe ... but maybe also not ....
---
My amd software has already set eve already to high performance..
---
Tho i havent updated my windows ver yet which means i dont have that option yet so i guess ill try it out.. p.s im in a metered network so thats the reason my windows is not updated [THE STRUGGLES]
---
No, we docked in them with a few too many roams that attacked NC and PL. Suddenly docking rights were revoked.
---
LUL, NC. was named as a joke about the coalition called the northern coalition. (Widot, Razer, mostly harmless, morsus mihi, goons/TCF majeta empire, R.A.G.E., TNT, Fcon, a few other groups I can;t remember because its been 10 years) Just because you weren't here and don't no NC. was a joke name doesn't mean anything.
---
It's just spring time, people are out enjoying BBQ's. 
---
It is just summer, people are out on summer vacation.
---
It is just fall, people are busy with school for themselves or kids.
---
It is just winter, people are just busy with the holidays and spending time with their family.
---
&gt; htp or one in etherium wouldn't be killed by horde
---
So you're admitting NC would kill a "freeport" they didn't control just as fast as goons would... good at least we are all on the same page.
---
The question is: why do you need a hisec at all? You just need a station of any kind to drop the loot in. Blue loot can be sold in lowsec just as well. it can also be stockpiled in an anchored container, if you're paranoid about being evicted, and evacced whenever you get a direct k-space connection. And being camped in lowsec is a marginal concern if you know how to move.
---
if you spend 98% of the time in highsec you don't have the means to build a supercap so why did you bother to use a sotiyo?
---
he said he moved to null, and there are also missions there in Blood Raider pocket / Serpentis pocket, even in Venal at guristas, etc.
---
&gt;Incursions are neither easily accessible nor reliable in repetition 
---
What is reading comprehension?
---
Wait, and you believed something Falcon posted?!
---
again ... fresh air my dude ... go out and get it
---
counter point: Ask congress while running for it about their rabid use of the "n-word" during highschool, their public comments on m.l. king and such. then pick up the mic, cough, drop it then sit down waiting for the answer. CNN will have fun with that one.
---
&gt; Are there any other structures or methods that would allow for a simpler, more nomadic life? Like, are POS's still, errr, possible? (I noticed a Caldari Control Tower in a system I was in) I'm really not looking to own the system, just squat there
---
don't forget to stront it / You can also use an orca on a alt that'll stay cloaked in a save where you can store some TIII &amp; Frigate so you can reship
---
&gt;Any reason why this wouldn't be a good idea? 
---
It's only a bad idea if there some people down the chain
---
&gt;- Any tips for anchoring structures? Is there a way to make deep safe, or off-grid placement of your accommodation?
---
Deep safe are useless for upwell structures as people can directly warp to them form the dscan or the solar system map
---
For POS peple have to dscan around to find it
---
For the structures there is two solutions
---
1) You make a bm so you have most of the sytem of dscan from the structure
---
2) you put it on the furthest planet and you anchor a drag bubble behind it, people will warp to the structure, will be dragged &amp; decloaked
---
&gt; Should I look for certain effects? Like, would Wolf Rayet be beginner friendly, or does it not really matter ultimately?
---
Except if you have something spécific in mind look for a vanilla hole
---
"solo" doesn't mean I don't have a couple spare scanning alphas in there. It just means that the isk is made solo. Why are you so salty?
---
Op clearly doesn't really know how the game really is.
---
Are \[RZR\] one of the new types of sotiyo rats? I didn't even have them on my overview. I put in a support ticket and a GM has now reimbursed it, apparently "nobody usually gets killed by those" VoV
---
ta for the tip :D
---
C2-HS/C3 are quite sought due to the nice C3 krabbing
---

as i went over in the last comment thread about this,

they were higher than the tax rates in our own panfam sotiyos so we never used them

are you fucking retarded

The same way "Fountain War" neglects reference to the other regions affected

https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Eve_University_Class_Library
---
But in general read more the wiki as you progress instead of videos. Further, ask people. There are ingame help channels. You should start looking for a corp. They would start to help you too. If not, change the corp.
---
that's simply not true tho.
---
and just because someone is in a group, doesn't mean the person can't run an impartial group, dafuq.
---
replace "grind structures" with "stay docked".
---
But that's beside the point. 
---
Metagame aside, last time Goons pissed majority of "the rest of the game", interesting times happened.
---
good meme, I lol'd.
---
Understandable.
---
I never had 10 or more but my amount of 5-6 went down to 1-2 as the need arises, exactly because of the absurd plex prices.
---
I'm more active now, but for a while i wasn't hugely active and considered just not plexing for a few months as it felt like i was just bleeding huge amounts of isk and not really getting anything out of it.
---
Aside from summer slump, the absurd PLEX price is absolutely keeping people from logging in en masse.
---
If you build it they will come

Check your PM. :)
---
don't get mad at me that you have zero ability to think logically.
---
Check your pm. :)
---
Yes. The reason why there are missions is because it's NPC owned. There's no missions in Insmother for example
---
Well exept horde
---
i just wanna say i really appreciate the civil discussion we're having about value systems in eve online and the decaying state of the game, you've been very respectful and receptive and i hope i've been the same for you
---
but yeah, what happened on serenity will eventually happen on tranquility, and i think everyone's known it's inevitable here since it happened over there. it's human nature, really; by a combination of factors like groups getting killed or evicted and scattering to the winds, leaders getting burnt out and groups merging into their larger neighbors, diplomacy, and annexation, eventually groups just coalesce into larger ones, and at some point if you don't belong to one of the mega-groups you don't really even have a shot at competing
---
eventually it boils down to two opposed groups, and they eventually have to fight, whether for ideological reasons or just because there's nothing else to do in eve online, and then one side wins and there's nobody left to fight
---
i guess we were all hoping it would never happen on tq, and we were hoping there would be enough political turmoil and timezone differences and just *enough space* that we'd be able to avoid being polarized the way serenity got, then we got the halloween war. we're lucky that wasn't the end of eve online and that enough game mechanic changes came through to shake things up and break down the blue donut then, but i don't think we're gonna get saved this time
---
this goon invasion is the death knell of eve online - goons are strong enough now that nobody can oppose them in open conflict except the entire rest of the game combined, and their growth outpaces everyone else so eventually not even that will be enough
---
somewhat fortunately it seems mittani is fully aware of the fact that permanently killing everyone else will also permanently kill eve online and is content to just go around burning shit down with his unironic apex force, but you're dead on with this point and probably more on the nose than you know:
---
&gt;Being in Goons is great fun, but the disadvantage is eventually we will have no content due to everyone getting crushed or us blueing every motherfucker in the game. It's sad and annoying but it is what it is
---
the reason pibc left serenity and came to tq is because this already happened to them there, there is so little to do on their server that the game is completely and irrevocably dead, and so they came to ours
---
when it comes to the point that goons have no content due to everyone getting crushed or blued, no one else will have any content either, and there isn't another server for us to move to after tq dies
---
sad is the word.
---
2014 at most
---
it would be a pretty fair fight actually. But hey, lets just fuck up this game even more
---
lmao stop being this retarded
---
TNT? Lmao
---
okay let's review:
---
my comment:
---
&gt;one [a freeport sotiyo] in etherium wouldn't be killed by horde
---
your comment:
---
&gt;So you're admitting NC would kill a "freeport"
---
any thoughts?
---
don't stop being so salty          
---
NCPL is dead, get over it
---
imagine being this obsessed with a group, it's a game you know?
---
Thanks, this is the sort of stuff I'm keen to understand more about.
---
I thought POS's had been removed or don't work the same anymore since structures.  But it's an area of EVE I'm completely blind to.  Essentially, would they still work for housing a meagre collection of ships and basic assets?  And what would be the pros and cons of using a POS vs. an Upwell Structure?  The POS's looked quite complex to set up.
---
Finally, what does 'BM' mean?
---
Great show loving it plz more episodes!!
---
case and point
---
POS are still up here, they will be removed when the replacement will be in game.
---
POS are cheaper but more complicated the upwell structure to set up;
---
POS need racial fuel while upwell structure can use any kind of fuel
---
POS are anchored faster (15min to 2h iirc) than upwell structure (24h) 
---
&gt;would they still work for housing a meagre collection of ships and basic assets? 
---
Yep imaging you go camping, the pos is the tent and you can store ships/modules in specific pos modules
---
BM are bookmark; you have to make a bookmarks of the hole so you can warp at the locations and to be able to share it with your corpmates/alt within the same corporation
---
revert the shitty changes and keep the good 5 or 6 ui changes they pushed
---
Ah, bookmark!  Yes, of course I catalogue all the connections with bookmarks.  Might consider using an app, depending on how this goes.
---
Thanks again - I will weigh up these two options!
---
I think it assumes perfect orbit, and at perfect orbit sleips would not be able to track a vaga

Thing is, we don't want hostile groups living near us. I know that this is difficult to understand when you've so quaffed a wholly inadvisable amount of the koolaid.

&gt;The irony is, everyone wants to shoot enemy ships.
---
The irony is, we're powerful now because we took the bold step of recruiting people for whom this is not exclusively the case. How can so many posters continue to say things like this when it's so plainly not true?
---
I was referring to what the title implies you mong
---
Oh, that makes sense I guess. The simulation just showed the sleips kiting in a straight line, so I assumed they would just volley the approaching vagas.
---
you're the one stalking my posts and responding to all my shit lmao
---
Spin.
---
give (a news story) a particular emphasis or bias.
---
I prefer the C4 with C3/C5 combo. Great iskies, fun pvp, easy logistics
---
Why would you say this, and in the same breath, accuse me of goalpost moving? Learn how to commit to a tack, you wishy-washy motherfucker.
---
Resource scarcity. Goals that make people willing to fight (something besides isk would be nice).
---
Ok easy now boi, the title implies that the whole world went to war cause bees and it sounds like ww3 - I'm not entirely sure what is so hard to comprehend here and kinda sad you still have to explain it, in the end of the day I couldn't care less about the goon spin but it sure as hell has a better tune to it than casino war or war of sovless aggression

I wrote a suggestion post on this a while ago...

The first eve trailer I watched many years ago that got me into the game.

Yes, that's what you're doing by wholly disregarding any play style other than your own. What's your point?

Logi on killmails

A combination of DayZ and EVE; less bugs, no blobs, no safe space and a healthy enough population so you don't struggle to find content while using ten accounts.

Dude, I fucking suck at this game and my kb is more impressive. Uninstall please.

I've never understood the hatred towards low sp players. You can have toys of fun in this game even with very little sp (which is why I often fly around in my lower sp chars)
---
Sounds about right.
---
You'd think after the utter failure of the "freeport" keepstars in Maila and Aunenenenen that one might realize how poorly such schemes fare in concentrating titans into the hands of one or two groups.

1: Access to everything in Eve is controlled by skills. While you're not subscribed (Alpha) your skills are restricted. There's a list of skills and levels which are available for Alphas. They cover most of the basic ships, and most weapon systems. If you subscribe (Omega) you get can gain every skill (you still have to dedicate skill points to them. you don't auto get them.) Alphas gain skillpoints at half the rate of Omegas, until they have 5 million skill points. (around 6 months worth at their training rate) then they don't gain them any more. If an Omega stops paying, they revert to Alpha status, losing access to the skills outside of the list for Alpha. This list is, if you trained it all, around 20 million skill points worth. If they resubscribe, they regain access to the skills they had trained. 
---
The main difference between Alpha and Omega, in regular use, is access to what are known at T2 ships. These are substantially more expensive in game, and generally better, more specialised ships than the T1 version. However, the faction versions remain available to both (assuming you trained the proper skills). For fleet combat, T1 ships are normal. (mostly for supply and cost reasons.) Alphas also don't get access to Capital ships and the specialist mining ships, beyond the basic frigate. 
---
2: If you find the right people, reasonably friendly. There's a lot to take in; the new player experience is a lot better than it used to be, but is still not wonderful. Get used to finding stuff online to explain things. The community, as long as you don't approach it with 'I'm new, and this is what's wrong with Eve!' is pretty accepting.
---
3: I'd say so. Especially because we're all on the same server. (China's the one place with its own. due to legal reasons)
---
4: Depends what you do, tbh. It can be very grindy, or not very grindy. If you like losing expensive ships, you'll have to do a lot more to replace them.
---
5: Not particularly. Micro transactions take 5 forms: 
---
PLEX: Buy these, to sell to other players, to get in game currency. Also to buy other microtransaction things (they can be used, in batches of 500, to pay for game time. Don't focus on this, as you will make your time an unpleasant grind) 
---
Cosmetics: Bought with PLEX from the New Eden Store. Or from other players, with in game currency (they bought them with PLEX) No in game effect other than  changing your portrait and how your ship looks.
---
Alpha Skill injectors: If you want to get skills at Omega rates, on a daily basis, without paying for Omega (a subscription is cheaper, but 30 day periods only) you can buy alpha skill injectors. These give you an injection of SP you can spend on any skill you want (assuming you have the prerequisites) 
---
Multi Character Training Certificates: By default, you can only train on one character per account. You have three characters on each account. So either you alternate training between them, or you use MCTC (or one of the wide variety of names for these. yay, consistency) to train on multiple at the same time. Lasts 30 days.
---
Skill Injectors: Can't actually be bought with PLEX. Created from Skill Extractors (bought with real money or plex. They're a bit of an anomaly) extracting skill points from a character, then sold on the market. Gives you 500,000 SP per injector, though diminishing returns kicks in later on, so you may only get 50,000, if you're above 80 million SP.
---
Nothing actually required there. Especially as, with Eve, it's generally pretty quick to 'master' a specific play style in skill points. More skill points really comes down to flexibility. 
---
6: uhhhh, I've been here since 2011?
---
7: Visually, not that customizable. You have standard ship hulls (there's 300+) which you can apply cosmetic skins to. (these skins are primarily from microtransactions, but they can be sold on the in game market. and there are event drops every so often) From a mechanics POV, there's more customization, but there's limits on what makes sense to do. Like there's nothing to stop you fitting a rifter with lasers, but it's not a good idea (no bonuses for lasers, and the ship really isn't laid out for it that way). When fitting a ship you have to pay attention to its strengths and weaknesses, as well as the various resources. It's an art, rather than a science. Many people just use fits that other people came up with. (couple of basic 'rules': Pick one weapon range and type per fit. Stick to it. Pick one defence type per fit. Stick to it. So no long and short range mix for weapons. If you're an armour fit, don't put on shield modules. etc)
---
8: I'd say so, but I've been here since 2011.
---
You're my favorite poster Scoots.
---
 Even the most brainfucked goon realizes that there is no point in fighting this war, and that no further content is gonna come from it.
---
The last time goons didn't piss people off, they were an overly ripe pinata that needed some bashing. That's what happened in world war bee.
---
On the other hand it is fairly ironic that the same playergroup that prides itself on not giving a shit had it's ego bruised so badly 3 years ago that they still think they need to go on some kind of "vendetta" against the north.
---
I am fairly certain that a big portion of the guys that fought in wwb aren't even playing anymore (on both sides), so what is the point? You need to have a stake in a perceived wrongdoing to exact "revenge".
---
This whole chestbeating on reddit because nothing is actually happening is the most hiv-positive shit that this sub has created in a long ass time.

how do you manage to spend that much ? and earn that much

I am sure it has nothing to do with EVE being catered towards an afk-resource-grinder with no meaningful content like micro conflicts that evolved around Moonmining POS for example ... or catered towards people multibox afking multiple hours every day for ISK instaed of people logging in and actuall play tabbed in for a few hours a week ...

Uhh, Vily's own BR had Legacy losses at 343 bill vs  EA+PanFams losses at 117 bill. I wouldn't say that was 'close', especially when the attacking forces were outnumbered. The keepstar fell, so that objective went to the attacking forces as well. Nobody 'held the field' because the Node crashed. And I did say that the momentum and morale boost went to Imperial Legacy, but that wasn't because of the tactical outcome, it was because of the strategic outcome. Overall, it was just hands down a tactical victory for the attacking forces. It just didn't matter because it was a strategic victory for Imperial Legacy. Such a massive one that it basically won the war.
---
Be happy with that. It's like you either didn't even read my post outside of that isolated quote, where I described UALX as not just an overall victory for Imperial Legacy, but pretty much the deciding battle of the entire war.
---
The game is stagnant.  There is no reason to fight for space.  There is nothing &lt;thatspace&gt; has that &lt;thisspace&gt; does not.  The only reason for the 1 big war thats happened this year is a grudge, not resources or any other ACTUAL reason to fight, just goons being angry with someone.

Plese try and show me how eve is p2w, come back after with the beautifull KM that you will collect.

Yeah lol, how the mighty have fallen!
---
&gt;some vendetta bullcrap

Any sane player does not give a rat's ass about reasons for a war. Sure, we can go full LARP mode and sustain a certain narrative to make any aggression feel justified, but in the end:
---
It's a freaking video game and things exploding is more interesting than building your personal wallet for no other reason than having it.
---
Likelyhood of fights is higher than when everyone would be crabbing in Delve.
---
So what's the best solution in your mind, assuming no major entity, including Goons, will magically dissolve or decide to go solo pvp in lowsec?
---
This is quality! Well done sir
---
Elite Dangerous has less content than EVE and that is saying a LOT.

Star Citizen is never going to actually release.  The scope of the game gets larger every single game.  I'm waiting for procedural dust motes to delay the game another 6 months.

NMS is actually pretty good now.  It was trash tier when it launched though, and I think that burned off a LOT of players who aren't willing to give it another chance.

your assertion is that the freeports in maila and aunenen were schemes to concentrate supercapitals into one or two groups?

don't blame the players for playing the game in their own best interest
---
 my idea offer counter play. You can kill the recons and intel/information is too powerful especially when bots are used and paired with (intel) programs. Its too easy for a defender in null to avoid content all together. This game was centered around pvp. Now, its centered around risk adverse PVE. Personally, I don’t want to play WoW as their are limited games like eve to begin with. Seems like the core players have left and majority of the players just want to grind with little risk. If thats the case, eve is building its own coffin.

What exactly does head damage value mean?
---
For example: The 75mm Gattling Rail II has a Head Damage of 0.60HP. The weapon itself has 40HP structure. Does that mean that it can survive 40/0.6 cycles with the weapon before it does? How does the spreading of head work?

I think you'd first want to start by getting a list of every mechanic, and asking yourself really honestly if these are good gameplay. If there's some good aspect of a mechanic or set of mechanics can we drill down a simplified version of it?
---
Take NPC standings, there's an obscene level of complexity and interactions in there. You have standings to corporations, then a seperate standing to that faction. That can lock you out of certain services/areas of space/pve content. Your corp then has aggregate standings based on membership which can block you from participating in faction warfare. Is this really a good mechanic? I don't think it's completely meritless, but I didn't see anyone complaining when they removed the standings requirement on installing jump clones in NPC stations. There's almost certainly some simplified form of NPC standings that could provide the interesting mechanics without the annoying aspects.
---
EVE 2.0 to me would really be an opportunity to go through and do that, just remove pointless complexity.
---
My second Titan is needed so I can deploy the first.... has zero kill marks on first, has never bridged anything but a freighter full of minerals.

XL weapons in general are insane (and magical, i'll get to that at the end). Let's look at XL arty. You are shooting 3500 mm shells. [This](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Schwerer_Gustav_shell_by_Daniel_Perez_Sutil.jpg) is a man standing next to an 800m shell. To propell that shell at a muzzle velocity of 820 m/s you needed [this beast](https://static.interestingengineering.com/images/uploads/sizes/schwerer-gustav_resize_md.jpg). Oh yeah and the turrets are configured in quad mounts in-game.
---
With tremor, you can shoot a shell 233 km in a tick (a second). This means our muzzle velocity is at 233.000 m/s (as opposed to the 820 m/s). Not to forget that we are shooting every 10 seconds as opposed to once every 30-45 minutes.
---
But this is where our fun ends. A tremor XL shell weighs in at 1 kg. The shell I linked earlier weighs in at 7 metric tonnes.
---
So yeah. Nice one CCP
---
Same goes with your math, unfortunately. A single Mjolnir XL Cruise Missile only has a mass of 1500 kg, which kinda nullifies a lot of your math  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
you forgot the dot
---
Tuz has decided which way people should play this sandbox.  You better confirm!
---

---
I see flaw in your math.        
---
You didn't include how much M^3 is used by a single missile.         
---
You can see this ingame - this will let you correct your calculations.
---
Best post i have seen in a while.
---
That's cause they were all originally MC structures. The Sotiyo and Azbel were MC. I am not so sure about the Tatara, might have come after MC let Basgerin.
---
While ratting armor npc pirates using armarr ships, should i stay on laser turrets bc of ship bonus or is it preferable to use projectile turrets with explosive / kinetic ammunition?
---
Does it have anything to do with the subject at all ? I mean, NC. is NC. now, whatever you think about it.
---
Argument is still retarded.
---
I dont know, I just know that Goons are too big for any entity in the game to provide them content. I guess its up to goonies to move on to smaller entities if they want content other than bashing undefended structures for 6 hours every day
---
Plank containers! Missiles and shells are plank containers that are larger inside!
---
EVE Battle Royale
---
Yeah. I simplified it down to an actinide-based fission fuel because the numbers were easier to find and slightly more generalisable. When it comes to absurdly powerful doomsday weapons, your mileage may vary.
---
I wish we could go a single day without an unironic example of INIT posting. Alas, it is not this day.
---
I have no idea what the DDs use, I'm just thinking of missiles. You can do some scary shit with them
---
&gt;A single Mjolnir XL Cruise Missile only has a mass of 1500 kg, which kinda nullifies a lot of your math ¯\\*(ツ)*/¯
---
That's why I threw out the in-game mass and volume numbers and made my own, based on looking at the physical model for the missile which I figured was the most reliable source of data. CCP's numbers for mass and volume are more for game balance and internal calculations than actual lore, and I wanted to know how powerful of a weapon you'd actually have if you were firing cruise missiles the size of Saturn Vs at each other.
---
you ok buddy?
---
What a waste of a spy lol
---
IIRC in canon the EoM has an Avatar which they used against a planet that "merely" scoured the surface of the place. Didn't quite tear continents apart, because as absurdly powerful as Titans are it takes even more absurd levels of power to deal that much damage to a planet.
---
Space is *big*.
---
Okay so this isn't r/france forum libre.
---
That's fine.
---
No wrong doing here.

Let me guess:   you're in Outer Ring?

On the off chance this isn't just another shitpost, I threw out the ingame values for mass and volume because they're so evidently BS. I went at this from a deeper lore perspective rather than in-game numbers to better represent the size and power of a short-range cruise missile the size of a large planetary rocket.
---
The Minmatar use the Gyrojet solution to the problem of caseless firearms.
---
:D
---
Remember that New Eden is a place where material compression exist, but you cannot do the same for gases.
---
I mean, on the scale of a planetary population these missiles are pretty much doomsday weapons. Just one of these things can pretty conclusively end life on a lightly-populated world.
---
I hate that argument, if they didn't mine we'd still be fighting in super expensive battleships and below. Which is the fucking dream.
---
Nerf mining into the ground pls.
---
Hmmm that’s what you say....
---
Ground det could end life on a medium pop world just from sending dust into atmosphere. And the eco system would be smashed. How do you think a Nag or Rags projectiles compare?
---
Current Eve with a few changes :
---
- HS is much smaller and basically carebear highland. No more incursions/invasion, L3 at best. It's here for tutorial and first few weeks of figuring out stuff. Moons are removed from HS.
---
- FW rework with all the obvious changes everyone have been asking about (removal of tier, sliding on gate, structures only for militia and automatically turn into low power if you loose the system). FW should be the area where people go to have easy and quick fights, not structure bashes. It should be the area where newbro goes for learning PvP.
---
- Missions rework, or more exactly "throwing everything into the trash and HS/LS PvP more like NS and abyssal combined. Easy to get in, challenging to be rewarding, no "5 jumps to get to the missions".
---
- LS moon mining is passive again.
---
- Ewar fighter speed nerf, titan HAW / LR gun tracking nerf.
---
- C4 PvE changes, also drifter structure farming nerf.
---
- Removing a timer from all structures except Keepstars, damage cap is now damage reduction once the cpa is reached (similar to logi rep nerf)
---
&gt;no further content
---
This post is the exact salt content required to continue a war. Goons thank you for your support.
---
My issue with that line of arguments is that, to my knowledge, has never happened on a relatively meaningful scale in Eve.
---
Maybe it will once the blue donut has formed and the sheer amount of boredom forces someone to do something. But betting on this scenario also assumes a period of immense boredom.
---
Pfth.
---
That’s no ones dream
---
You're forgetting one thing. What makes an explosion deadly? It isn't the ball of fire, it's the wave of pressure.
---
See, I always took mineral compression as a sort of light refining process, eliminating most of the unwanted waste material in a cursory manner to reduce the volume of the material. It leaves significant impurities so further refining is necessary, but it's able to be done with relatively uncomplicated equipment and in a quick and cheap fashion.
---
The reason gasses can't be compressed is likely because of the risk that doing so might change their molecular composition. Compressing a gas could likely cause the temperature to change which could cause the molecules in the gas to come apart and reform into less desirable compounds. It's likely that gas is only stable under certain conditions and compressing it could render it useless.
---
I'm far from a chemist, hence the weasel words, but there's reasonable explanations for both phenomena.
---
I'd have to crunch the numbers but from a cursory analysis it seems like they'd be pretty much just as destructive.
---
ya
---
fucking poggers dude
---
As a content hole, C2-&gt;NS/C5. It's the classic. 
---
You can roll the NS until you find content and most of the time the C5 side will have a highsec exit a few jumps into the chain for logistics.
---
As a farm hole, C6-&gt;C6 or C6-&gt;C5. But you need to be ready to defend if you want to hold a C6 or even a desirable C5. So if I'm just by myself any C5-&gt;C5. Nobody really wants them enough to evict someone just for the hole.
---
Honorable mention to C6-&gt;C6 space in 2013/2014 when C6 space was settled by PVP corps and rolling your C6 static had a good chance of getting you a good fight.
---
................................................................................. if this is what's left of the playerbase, eve is truly (brain)dead
---
Triglavian Invasions are a bit different and a bit riskier since they haven't been figured out yet. Expect to lose a lot of ships, but I've heard of people making a couple billions a day from them (with some luck). You can also ninja salvage or ninja loot people who are running the invasions (ninja salvaging is fine, ninja looting will make you suspect, so anybody can shoot you). Expect to lose a few ships to the triglavians or to other people (if you're ninja looting) though, it's still pretty risky.
---
Yes but PANFAN does not feed, so we don't fight and eventually you all get bored to shit. This is what pay to win has brought you guys. You payed yourself to the top and now your all alone with no interesting content.
---
yep, easily the most autistic streamer I've ever seen, which is probs why he's playing eve
---
yay more krabbing.....
---
Well, yeah. I had to use Nukemap Classic because normal Nukemap doesn't go above 100Mt and Nukemap Classic doesn't (AFAIK) show you pressure information all that far out. So the most I had to go on was the radius of third-degree burns. It's likely the pressure wave would be severe enough to cause serious injury and major property damage across the length and breadth of a continent.
---
Don't forget that when you're living in wh space you're probably in a wh corp. You're not the only one scanning. Usually doesn't take more than 20 minutes to get a chain scanned a few jumps deep.
---
No clue what your point is but ok
---
You being in TNT only makes people not taking anything serious that you say.
---
Grab a Heron and fit it with a Data and a Relic analyser, plus a scan probe launcher and optionally a cloak.
---
That's really all you need. If you have to ask this question then something like an Astero is probably a bad investment for you.
---
It's terrifying right up until you fire that meganuke at a rowboat. Then it does nothing. Makes sense, right?
---
You think that's terrifying? That's just a bog standard Nova missile. Look at the in-game parts list for manufacturing Tech 2 Scourge Missiles, and pause once you realise that what the Caldari are firing at you aren't Kinetic Impactors - they are goddamn ***artificial black hole generators***.
---
l RP as a miner in my rorq when were not at war lol
---
And if they mined even less we'd fight in T1 cruisers. 
---
Having more people mine and generate isk just raises the bar for everyone, but it's not any more or less fun because your ships are more blingy.
---
Yeah, seems the Amarr are a little underwhelming. I dont see a laser ending a world like the other 3
---
shut up retard
---
well you can't fight back in game so we have to come to where you can work up the courage to hit the downvote button
---
Hi NC, probably want to spend more time in game than on reddit
---
Sit on their face until they biomass.
---
&gt; how do you manage to spend that much ? 
---
It's very easy to do when you're training up multiple toons and buying multiple pilot training certificates, titan skill books, blueprint originals, install and research costs on big ships or big ship BPOs, buying blingy ships, etc.
---
&gt; and earn that much
---
Diversify your income.
---
In-game it's established that small objects can avoid taking the full damage of a missile if the explosion is larger than the vessel. Which makes intuitive sense, as hitting a city with a nuke doesn't impart every building with the full energy of the nuclear weapon.
---
To be honest, that's not even the worst thing. That has to go to whatever the fuck the Erebus uses to generate a million-tonne ball of *fucking antimatter*.
---
Maybe I'll write up a post on that at some point.
---
Russians are on the server from the start in 2003, in fact they were some of the oldest powerhouses like Stain Empire, or the old Red Alliance that grew the goon child in ts space-belly ...
---
i love killing miners
---
fix mining for more miners pls
---
I think the ISP figure isn't right. Eve ships don't decrease in mass as they move so theres obviously something more complicated than good old newtons third law going on.
---
Doesn't even have to be battleships. Could be cruisers for all I care.
---
I don't fly bigger or more expensive ships because they're "more fun" or anything, I fly them to match the opponents fleet comp.
---
your 'elite pvp' lifestyle choices will get you nowhere mwhahaahaha
---
Seems like the BRs are just a bit wonky. The live update post pegs it at 1.05t Eastern Allies losses vs 1.15t Imperial Legacy losses (1.45 including the keep, but that doesn't matter as much if we're talking purely about the battle side of things). Regardless, it seems like the consensus from most people on both sides is that EA won the isk war. Granted, it wasn't nearly as severe as I'd originally assumed, so you're right in regards of it being pretty close.
---
And if you log in, loot the field, kill stragglers, and plant hundreds of bubbles... That's a strategic victory. That didn't happen during the fight, it happened in the aftermath, the battle was effectively over when the node crashed. The same as dropping another keepstar right after. They still won the objective in the fight, it just didn't matter afterwards.
---
The issue is in WH  there seems to always be sleepers ship prespawned when I get to the site ( either that or someone beat me to the site) and  I can't clear those with an exploration heron ( I'm really not used to combat also)
---
So either I'm always late to the site,
---
Or I do the combat to poorly to clean the NPCs
---
Or I'm not supposed to do that in a heron
---
I also do gas huffing venture so I know my way in WH  the only issue I have are those guard NPCs
---
The problem is the isk per hour is already super low now. The more people you have on grid the less isk over all you make.
---
I never thought about using a Titan to convert a freighter into a jump freighter. Emergent gameplay?
---
irl or in game
---
As with all things, it really depends how much energy you put into it. Though admittedly the paltry 520Gw consumed by the Dual Giga Beam Laser II is hardly world-ending.
---
Hey someone let me know if they had better tax
---
Yo fam we dont use them cause im house had better rates and better index tax
---
You liar!!!!!!
---
Same same
---
Next
---
No good for me then. I'd be dead as soon as the jump stealth wears off😂
---
I used a simplified, real-world model for the missiles, figuring that it would be worth it to the denizens of New Eden to use cheap tech for their disposable ammunition instead of fitting every missile with a warp drive. So the missile accelerates at just under 1km/s and has 14km/s of delta-v instead of instantly reaching terminal velocity as it does in-game.
---
I'm more interested in figuring out how these weapons stack up in the real world, rather than looking at what's happening in-game. If the IG missiles were at all reflective of their RW counterparts then firing one of these things at a titan should nope it out of existence.
---
You think rof 3500mm quad siege artillery is insane? What about 2500mm fucking **repeating cannons**? That sounds even more crazy if you ask me.
---
The key is to hit the pirate data/relic sites and not the sleeper ones. For sleeper data/relic sites the loot in the cans is honestly not that much compared to the loot from the sleepers.
---
Eve then, with planetary and atmospheric strike, the local air would explode, but I cant see the laser doing more than burning through the crust of a planet (and taking forever to do it). Maybe agitate the mantle enough to cause a cataclysmic simultaneous volcanic event?
---
Actually fuck that's right. I'll try doing the math with rigs etc just to see how insane our numbers can get
---
Wait, passive LS moons, but still have active NS ones?
---
Found the lazy LS idiot!
---
Yes because mining in NS and LS is so similar !
---
5th Playable race
---
LOL claiming anything run by Jeronica is neutral. My fucking sides.
---
That's because the Amarr prefer to enslave populations
---
Note that there is a falloff in deadlyness of the shockwave: at this insane load the atmosphere will probably mostly blow into space, so getting an atmospheric shockwave all the way across the planet is hard.
---
&gt;  if you targeted New York with one of these monsters you'd give people as far as Burlington third-degree burns
---
Now imagine being inside the capsule that gets hit by one of these and survives.
---
That it could do. The main damage from a laser weapon isn't necessarily in the direct energy but in the thermal flux it can generate by pulsing. By pulsing on and off it can force repeated cycles of heating and cooling, and repeated cycles of expansion and contraction, in a material which can break it apart over time. Hence why Pulse Lasers do more damage than Beam Lasers (I think, I don't use lasers but I think that's how they work). So an Avatar *could* sit above a planet and continuously cycle its lasers and *eventually* you'd see serious effects but it might be much quicker to nuke/railgun/shoot it from orbit.
---
That being said, there's also the matter of attenuation and the amount of energy being pumped into the atmosphere, most of which is going to turn into heat...
---
&gt; dirtsiders
---
I hope this pejorative is canon. Because it's hilarious.
---
True, but that's arguably almost as bad. Having the atmospheric pressure drop significantly causes its own fair share of problems.
---
Look at this fucking guy lol. Another random f1 pusher talking shit.
---
C3/C5, k-space and solid flow of content from C5 chain
---
Do u always believe what people say at face value?
---
You were probably rejected because of an ongoing war.
---
Check back when Dinos are done with Fraternity.
---
charon with cargo enhancers dude !!!!!
---
Yes, but if we were in a vacuum of space it wouldn't do nearly that much damage, meaning while yes, the missile does explode with such a force, the damage it would actually deal is much less. I'm not saying your explosive power calculations are incorrect, I'm saying the damage to ships would be localized to the explosion only.
---
All these bullshit propoganda. There is only 1 truth and that truth is that CCP added the tools for players to pay to win. Imperium used these tools to pay themselfs to be the top tier. 
---
Before these tools PL/NC where the top tier due to old eve online players with the isk and skills to have supers and titans. It was that fleet that hold the hordes at bay. In that time i left online, eve online was good in 2014/2015. Good fights all over as we could fight against 5:1 odds due to our supercaps.
---
I came back in a post skill injection era and everything has changed. Imperium now outnumbers our supercap fleet 3:1. and subcap fleet 8:1 There is 0% change of winning a large scale fight so PANFAM wont even try and hopes for the occasional subpcap skirmishes that have 2:1 odds. 90% of these fights NC/PL wins due to our more experienced FC's but our FC's cant let magic happen as Harry Potter does so when the odds shift to 5:1 when imperium brings reinforcements we run and dock or get obliterated.
---
Imperium is the top tier in this game now. None has the numbers they have, they are up there at the top spot, all alone with none that can provide any interesting content.
---
Thank you CCP for throwing in the towel and adding pay to win to slowly destroy the gem that was Eve online.
---
In all fairness, it's an object the size of a compact car that masses 24 metric tons. It's pretty likely that thing is armoured as all hell and not much short of a direct impact is going to destroy it. In the event of a nearby detonation in space much of the energy probably simply goes around the pod and the armour just tanks the rest.
---
It absolutely is, IIRC.

---
It seems from the eve university on WH sites that all WH data and relic sites have some sort of NPCs
---
Where do you find the pirates sites? In low/ nullsec ( outside wh)? Or is the eve university page only listing WH exclusive site and note other sites that spawn everywhere
---
Well if "light refining" process is reducing size why fully refined materials takes few times more space.
---
Well, not to be a dick or anything, but people have been doing that for ages. It's one of the main forms of nullsec-industry logistics, much more efficient in both fuel and time than regular jump-freighters.

Come to wormholes

---
Yeah no
---
True. But if it goes off right next to or in direct contact with a ship then suddenly you have your pressure wave. With that kind of energy I expect starship armour would behave more like a liquid or a gas than a solid, and anyone onboard would (to borrow from XKCD) stop being biology and start being physics.
---
Bob giveth and Bob taketh away
---
Look forward to your fight against the chinky bots in your new alliance kidda
---
PVP GOD
---
E-Uni should list other sites in WHs. You can find pirate data/relic sites in WHs, these don't spawn rats.
---
Que the people saying "high sec is too safe, it needs to be more dangerous like null sec...."
---
Are your "decline" based on your personal observations?
---
Could be storage inefficiencies, taking into account the volume added by whatever container you're storing it in. Could be that compressed ore uses Planck generators. Could be that CCP just couldn't be arsed when they pulled volume numbers out of a hat.
---
Unfortunately there's not a lot of consistency with the numbers in this game.
---
&gt; This means that if an 800mm shell weighs in at 7t, our 3500mm shell weighs in 30.625t (because 800 x 4.375=3500 and 4.375 x 7=30.625 )
---
Assuming a constant aspect ratio of the ammo (diameter to the height in picture) multiplying the diameter of the ammo by 4.375 would increase the volume (and weight, assuming constant density) by 4.375^3 =~ 83.74x, to 586t.
---
&gt;#Broker Fee
---
&gt;The broker fee is due on order creation for all non-immediate orders and is based on a percentage of the total order value. Starting at 3% of the order value, the skill "Broker Relations" reduces the fee by 0.1% per level. In addition, increased standings with the owner of the NPC station where the order is placed may reduce it by up to another 0.2% with maximum standing, and good standings with the owners faction can reduce the fee by further 0.3%, to a minimal broker fee of 2% of the order value. This results in the following formula to calculate the percentage for the broker fee:
---
&gt;3%-(0.1%*BrokerRelationsLevel)-(0.03%*FactionStanding)-(0.02%*CorpStanding)
---
&gt;The Broker Fee only take unmodified standings into account, so skills that increase your effective standing, such as Connections or Diplomacy, do not have an effect on the fee.
---
&gt;If an order is changed to a higher price, the difference in broker fee has to be paid with committing the change. Reducing the price will always cost a 100 ISK broker fee. All broker fees are non refundable within normal gameplay, even if an order is not fulfilled at all or cancelled early.
---
&gt;Broker Fees will be paid to the station owner. In an Upwell structure with Market Module, this means that this fee is paid to the owners of the structure and is customizable. The Broker Relations skill does not apply on Upwell structures.
---
 
---
&gt;#Sales Tax
---
&gt;Sales taxes are due after an item has been sold, and are payable by the seller. They will be automatically deducted from the sales transaction and start at 2% of the sales price. This percentage can be reduced down to 1% through the "Accounting" skill.
---
There's also corporation tax. It applies to all NPC bounties, mission rewards and incursion payouts and goes straight to your corp's master wallet. Corporation is fixed at 11% for NPC corps and can be set to anything from 0-100% in player corps.
---
Its funny how this has become "truth" now. There are more day to day losses with Rorqual's then there ever were with POS. I would even argue that the total ISK value on dead ships total with Rorq's are larger then the ISK total on POS fights.
---
On a slow day there are 50B of Rorq's deaths
---
Which would still take far longer, which is less scary than an immenant "fuck you" launch button. As the other dude said, the Amarr like to enslave people, but that too is harder when the defenders have time to disrupt the laser, where as say if the Gallente show up and say "we've got a fuck load of antimatter pointed at your planet, surrender or dont exist anymore"
---
Ok read something about it on the forum
---
Yahaaaaar!
---
What do you mean "do it right this time"? It's gonna be a 1.12 Vanilla from the get go but with more stable server and client. There's no way of doing it more right. This is what player base asked for so that's what we're getting. With all the good and all the bad stuff that comes with it.
---
How recently have you played Star Citizen, if at all?
---
It is getting there pretty quickly. Squadron 42, the single-player/campaign version is targeting a Summer 2020 release. 
---
I mean, Star Citizen was announced back in 2012, and 7 years later we have something that looks and feels amazing, though still not polished. It has taken some AAA games 10 years or more to get to this point. 
---
It pales in comparison in terms of scope. . .large ships with completely modeled and decorated interiors, cargo bays where you can see your cargo, you can land you ship in hangars, landing pads, and on planets. . .station interiors and interaction with NPCs and objects. . .I can definitely see how the finished product will be very immersive.
---
most gases can be compressed without an issue. What can happen is that some of the elements of the heterogeneous gas are condensated from compression, because the  absorption factor of the gas decreases with pression (just like cooling air condensates water).
---
I would like to know how the ships cool these giant guns. The amount of heat generated is tremendous when firing shells, and that heat has to go somewhere.  The vacuum of space doesn't do a good job at dissipating heat.  So I would assume that an expendable heatsink would needed to be used to dissipate all that heat.
---
Where does all the heat go??
---
Why to the power of 3 (i think that's how you say it in English?)?
---
I'll gladly include it if I can understand why. But as mentioned, I'm very well aware that it doesn't scale linearly.
---
Also that makes the numbers out of this world
---
More funny Clips of his Eve Stream:
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/WanderingDeadGullTriHard
---
They are exactly the same. As it should be.
---
Agreed on Elite Dangerous it is a bit of an arcade shooter with some space mechanics and exploration thrown in, but it looks better and is more rewarding in the short term than Eve. . .thus it draws in more players.
---
Star Citizen is moving quickly in recent months. They have had some major system and design feature that had to be ironed out, but there is content. Squadron 42, the single-player/campaign game is targeting a Summer 2020 release.
---
The sites that dont have rats will use the name of a pirate faction. So it will have Sansha, Gurista, or another one in the site name.
---
Anything that isn't connected a pirate faction (Forgotten or Unsecured, erc ) will be a sleeper site.
---
Who are these RAZOR guys? Weren't they MM pets?
---
Hilmar's son is playing EVE???
---
For level 5. Its big revards for big risks. Not all systems are pemanently camped, but don't expect to be able to run missions 5 hrs straight.
---
For your wife you can do both. Start new alpha for here, let her do intro missions, and maybe Sisters of eve epic arc, then she can decide if she wants to continue on here char or on your alt.
---
You shoud not limit yourself to only shild or armor specialist. It doesnt take that long to train armor tanking skills, so train them (compensation skills can be at 4).
---
Burner missions are not really hard. watch  some youtube/twitch streams, and like i said just train some armor skills where needed.
---
For level 4's the king is shield tanked macariel. You blitz missions, google for blitzing missions guide.
---
As far as datacores go, unless you have whole production chain set up (preferably in sov null), it's usually not worth it.
---
In this game, all ships are tempporary, you will loose it sooner or later. Use cheap ships (heron for pure exploration, VNI for combat sites).
---
I don't feel like my cruise missiles do as much damage as you think they do  \&gt;.&gt;

Instanced fleet battlefields kinda like a mix of the alliance tournament and abyssal pvp.  Let players build an Upwell Structure that will cost resources to gate your fleet to this battlefield and duke it out vs an evenly matched fleet.  Winners can loot the field and get some other worthwhile reward.
---
i didnt come to eve from planetarion but i did play it.. was pretty awesome back in the day... login to mass fleets coming at you and rushing to get people to come defend you.
---
It's a wonderful time to feed.
---
Koral playing again? :P
---
Guess you owned the libtards. /S
---
Bombers Bar, being primarily a SIG of PanFam, feed mostly of Goons, cause you know.... so much hate towards Goons.

Me everytime i see an alliance doctrine
---
People say the same thing in the Winter.
---
New players: Woo, let's have fun and learn to blow shit up.  Damn, I died. This is fun!  
---
Old players: Fuck you guys and everyone else. You'll never know how good it was back in the day. I'm not salty, your salty.
---
Not from Planetarion directly, but I did used to play it a lot years and years ago.  It's still going apparently and Appocmaster is still running it as well.  I played from fairly early on around round 2 or 3 I think.  I was definitely at uni at the time, so must have been shortly after the game started.  I actually met up with a few people who I played with.  It was a fun enough game, but got a bit samey after a while.
---
Game is shit.
---
Lol, WTF you talking about? WH space is still a great place to make money and buy ridiculously blingy shit. Please enlighten me when WH ratting was nerfed as often as NS anoms? WHs are the no. 1 reason for kills.
---
Not really a lot of damage. If you use Eve Mechanic, you can just run around in circles when you are about to be hit by one of these cruise missiles.  You will take significantly less damage...

---
Winter dip isn't as big since generally people don't take as much time off, weather isn't as nice (at least in northern hemisphere)
---
I cannot express how much I appreciate that I get to play this game with people that are sooooo much smarter than me.
---
I agree, but disagree on the Elite Dangerous and Eve content part. Elite Dangerous is kind of small in scope, I would define it more as an arcade shooter that looks to provide instant gratification, not a long-term experience. A lot of content in Eve is gated behind months of real-time just waiting for skills to train- if you don't spend billions to inject -or requires the player to be apart of a major corporation and or alliance to experience the content fully. The Eve experience can be effectively reduced to spreadsheet and icons in space while Elite allows complete control of your ship and requires skill to pilot.
---
Thus, Elite Dangerous will attract and retain more people than Eve Online.
---
I would say much of the same about No Man's Sky, though I have never played it myself. 
---
Star Citizen is getting very close actually. Squadron 42 is targeting a Summer 2020 release, and a lot of the systems are shared (code wise) with Star Citizen. I've been playing the Alpha with every release and there are still plenty of bugs, but in general it looks great. I'm optimistic.
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Pay to win is paying for an UNFAIR advantage.
---
It requires getting things that are either restricted from the rest of the population or prohibitively difficult to get.
---
You just don't understand the term pay to win or what the problems are with it.

The basis is that you have to pay as a requirement to be competitive.

This PVE expansion has considerably reduced participation in certain segments of my corp.

Some krab people subbed in anticipation of it.

Thanks CCP.

yes, you are playing the game correctly.
---
Quantum Thermal Calculators.
---
I think in canon it's a combination of hull plating and internal heatsinks. Literally boiling a vat of lithium to cool your weapons.

Unless you are targetted by a Passive Targetter module; in which case you won't see a yellow box.
---
This game is a sandbox.  So it's where you are wrong.

If you nerf defense you will kill content. Why peopel will undock if they will die with no hope to survive ?  Actually you have people undock beacause they know they could receive help. Maybe they will die, but they knwo if they die it will be in a battle and not just "HOLOL GET REKT BY MY NANO CRUISER HOLOL". 
---
True PVP player want content and they have it if they make effort. YOU don't want content you want a push to win button.
---
You think i have no proof of that ? Check what happen in region with 0 umbrella and camped... you want a full empty 0.0 ? PErsonnaly i prefer an active 0.0 where you must use brain before engage.
---
Whats krab?
---
No caps, no alliances, no anchorable structures larger than a small pos.
---
moar !
---
Satistics doesn’t show that, WH activity has drastically declined since 2016.
---
Now imagine the number of ammo spend in a super battle ...
---
lol it be like that
---
The amount of munitions expended in a large supercap fight, such as the recent fight in WH-, likely is sufficient to do significant damage to a planet.
---
Squadron 42 was originally targeted for a 2017 release.  We're now into 2 years late, and still another year for their next "planned release date".  I'll believe it when I see it.
---
Back in the day someone did the math and that a single Thermal XL Cruise Missile (Citadel cruise missiles back then) would combust the entire atmosphere of Earth.
---
Also, all artillery shoots disks.
---
CCP released some year ago percentage of player who undock, crab, pvp, ect. The pvp % was extremely terrifying for a game that’s suppose to be centered around pvp. So no its not a sand box if majority of the players are docked or ratting. More of a WoW style MMO.
---
All I personally do is solo and small gang pvp. I just do it with friends who happen to be in Dreddit.
---
So it's either being a carebear or making money through pve missions, based on a russian slur for jewish people?
---
You are correct PLEX doesn't create or generate ISK.  PLEX is used to buy ISK generated by the economy.  That doesn't stop players from buying ISK with PLEX.  The market (supply and demand) affects the rate at which PLEX is traded.  This has nothing to do with industry activities.  I believe ISK is infitite and is generated by the economy as needed.  It isn't backed by a commodity.  Like US currency it's printed as needed, where once US currency was backed by gold.  The value of a dollar was based on th price gold traded at.  EVE has no such standard.  I hope that clarifies my position.  If my explanation is true, it's not wrong.
---
Lack of investment in the game. Eve has been running on essentially a skeleton crew since 2009 when the bulk of CCP's resources were diverted to WoD and Dust. Aside from a few brief sprints, the game has never had the level of CCP investment it had previously. We see this as long periods of stagnation with small changes separated by attempts to shake things up with big but low effort changes.
---
Such Crab has titan, too lazy to make multiple JF trips.
---
Nah, I pretty much exclusively do solo and small gang stuff, I make my isk on hisec markets. Fuck krabbing entirely.
---
You can tell who the frat botters are so fast nowadays. It's the same posts over and over.
---
If you were flying a Corvette or frigate, sure. But you are talking about a capitol class weapon here. You have already threw out the given number a for volume and mass for the missile, as such, you can't use those same measurements in accordance to ship sizes either then. If the armor survived the initial explosion, then the remaining energy would reflect off of it as the explosion would more focus on expanding into the vacuum.

Nullsec is just player run high sec
---
It would, but it would really crunch on the small gang fun I'm having with corp, so I wouldn't like it. I'd rather see a soft war of border skirmishes and not constant pings and ctas for structure warfare.
---
As for "a pretty fair fight", at first yes, but the fact is goons have way more industrial power and would be able to replace much, much faster. Even with the more experienced cap and super FCs in test, I don't even think at 2:1 we'd be able to keep up with losses. That doesn't even account for the fact that after a few super brawls, the goon FCs would be shaking the rust off and getting their shit together.
---
On the subcap side it would be, much like panfam vs goons, a fucking holocaust, but the neverending fountain of shit coming out of Delve means it barely matters. Panfam will run out of structures LONG before goons run out of ships.
---
If all 3 major sides' industrial backbones were roughly equal, frankly Test would faceroll everyone right now, with goons being the #3 power. It's their industrial might that gives them what they have, and makes it such a pain in the ass to fight em.
---
...yes, that is correct.
---
Did you read? We're shooting everything.
---
DREDDIT IS RECRUITING

lol
---
For the past.. year or 2 HK has been focusing alot on like Kspace OPs or bigger ops in wspace and not just doing your like... typical roll in and fight each other content. They were in a 2-6-nullsec and just recently moved back to a 5-5, so that might change.
---
Planck
---
What does the Tribute war have to do with being a nice guy and making a public announcement to not start any new production so high sec industrialists don't lose money?
---
I would assume the Panfam/Imp/Test high sec cartel would want every sot and azbel gone so people have to pay 12mil tax in Perimeter instead of 2.5 mil tax in Botane or 2 mil tax in Basgerin to build an eagle.
---
And you can. Because of EVE.
---
&gt; CCP can not make PvE fun EVER. 
---
This is the problem that needs to be fixed.
---
Also ITT, people who hunt the Buffalo to extinction then complain there's no more Buffalo to shoot. Without sheep, the wolves starve.

Nah PLEX tank is best tank
---
Goons are terrible people. They are actually here to ruin the game.
---
P.S. Did you actually use the "R" word in a derogatory fashion?  You're a bad person.
---
You build supers for a war power, yeah, their enemies are probably going to pave your face. Maybe they should, uh, protect you since you've clearly picked a side?
---
Otherwise, RIP, hope to see you guys rebuild. Not ENTIRELY sure why they're hitting your hisec assets.
---
Cos Goons are smashing it because of the Tribute war cos they build supers for NCPL

This. Rorq mining pulled the alt count down because of hisec, then the alt count came back up in null for a while. Plex prices and rorq nerfs pulled it back down.

Getting my popcorn ready for the comments
---
Give them all you got, if it's not an overpayment, its a loan!
---
Honestly the biggest problem with those holes is rolling into hisec for logistics. I guess you get enough inbound C2s that it won't take long to find a good border lowsec or hi connection that isn't camped. Still, :effort:
---
I'm from Planetarion but only played round 1-5 last round i was in Deus ex Machina made rank 3 or so with my galaxy.

Character name should be something with Steelrat.
---
Yeah, No. It's a PL structure. Don't be nieve.
---
if you find a wormhole that you consider jumping into, just click on it and show info. if it says that it leads to "unknown" space, its a C1-C3 wormhole which will have the pirate sites you're looking for. if it says "dangerous" or "deadly" unknown space, you wont find any pirate sites there. so, once you're in the wormhole and scanned down sites, stay away from anything that says "forgotten" or "unsecured" as these sites will have sleepers ;) as for the rest, good luck and dont forget to bookmark your exit. enjoy your adventure
---
I'm just waiting for the traders to fuel another WWB
---
Homeworld 3
---
And legacy still thinks they need goons to beat PANFAM lmao
---
One thing to note is that you might be running into sampling bias here. It's fairly well-known that alliances that are losing wars are more hesitant to deploy supers than those that are winning, and vice versa, so PanFam's numbers are likely deflated from the actual number of supers owned.
---
Yea, it’s not as easy as most but like you said, most days you get a wandering c2/low/hs. My play hours are kinda weird, usually starting after DT for a few hours, so it was always nice and quiet for logistics.
---
Yes there is, but you can only put one in a system. Most hunting fleet's I've had to fight off just bubbles the Jump Gate or puts a bunch of drags up. The point I wa making is by the time you ping, form a fleet, solidify your comp and burn to the tackled ship, you'll either not make it in time or the hostile fleet will just leave. Which returns my original point that this doesn't seem like people want to be able to save tackled ratting or mining ships.   
---
If you tackle a rorq and that rorq lights a cyno, you can bridge a sub cap fleet to that rorq directly. Well anyone who has led a fleet that bridged into hostile optimal range know it doesn't go very well for you. I'm sure that if you addressed the ability for caps to project onto subs, you would get the result you are looking for
---
PLEX is a commodity backed by game time.
---
That's where it derived value.
---
In universe it's nothing and means nothing. But it is backed by something with value in the only way it needs to be.
---
"why won't NC/PL defend their keepstars?"  
---
I hear this every single day after I've killed some salty retard in Delve
---
Water pipes to transfer heat to radiators
---
cool story bro
---
Probably C2 C5/Null for small gang pvp. Inbound C2s would be common enough to get me into lowsec for those shenanigans, and to hisec for logistics, so it really shouldn't take long at any given point to find fights. Throw in some suicide ganking or smartbombing if we get bored? Oh, and I guess run sites, that's a thing maybe lol.
---
Biggest reason I don't move into jspace: I need to sub more PI toons and shit to make money because I don't have an entire nullsec alliance paying me to haul shit.
---
The irony is "Goons Shoot enemy ships" = "less good fights"
---
Isn't this a game about shooting enemy ships? Or am I missing the point of this PVP game thing?
---
Lowsec is probably under WH in terms of security, mostly because of having local. You can't travel as easily as HS because of a couple gatecamps (especially in pipe systems and gates to hs or null). It isn't as organized as null so you don't really have intel channels if you want to PvE. But you still have Local, so you can check how many people are in system, check their killboard and check if there's a possible gatecamp before seeing it, so it's not as dangerous as WH. Oh and, of course, you have asset safety in lowsec.
---
Radiators don't work in space.  A true vacuum won't have any heat transfer...
---
NPC null is way safer than hisec lol, there really aren't that many dudes there, and fucking with mission running gilas usually takes at least a couple guys.
---
Yeah, null is full of fucking krabs, even moreso these days than before. If you actually look like a pirate everybody docks up.
---
Extra credit to whomever can find the average character age for the bulk of those super/titan pilots
---
Something like that. Meanwhile in null, risk averse carebears.
---
he literally said "if the objectives of the war IN TRIBUTE are to the reset THE REGION economically" and OP is talking about NOT TRIBUTE (New Caldari), then how is my comment not a valid response?
---
It's turned into just any activity that makes isk so Ratting/Mining/DED sites
---
&gt;You have already threw out the given number a for volume and mass for the missile, as such, you can't use those same measurements in accordance to ship sizes either then.
---
The volume and mass can both be fairly easily approximated from the model and the size figures given in-game.
---
&gt;If the armor survived the initial explosion
---
I think you underestimate the sheer magnitude of the value that is 5.6Gt. This is a weapon that can vaporise cities on planets, city-sized starships aren't going to fare any better when facing a direct hit.
---
&gt;E2: also, you're forgetting one thing, these ships are one man vessels where if the shop gets destroyed, a small capsule comes out as an escape pod.
---
Incorrect. It has been well established in canon that all ships are crewed. Compared to non-capsule ships they are manned by a skeleton crew, but skilled engineers and technicians are still required to maintain the finer machinery. And on larger vessels these crewmembers will require support staff of their own; cooks, cleaners, and the like.
---
This shows you have no grasp on the most basic of concepts. Don't project your nonsense back on me.
---
Yeap, as I mentioned in the post, I don't think this is actually the number of supers each coalition can field. But I don't think it's way off, i.e. Imperium probably does have double the titans than PanFam.
---
die
---
gotta remember that titans for example are canonically banned in highsec because they are so massive that their gravitational pull is dangerous to planetside life.
---
a considerable GRAVITATIONAL PULL.
---
I think these weapons might even be a little weak. Remember, they aren't supposed to fight cities, their targets are more akin to flying moons.

---
Another thing you can do is using wormholes to find a path to nullsec. From there you can roam/scan and do the very lucrative relic/data sites there. Be sure to check local for hostiles and dotlan for activity. Always scan in safe bookmarks, aligned to an object (ideally in a cloak, if you are not an alpha).
---

---
Is the actual decline in players from 2016 to 2019.. that is not in question as that is a fact ;)
---
is this irony?
---
 Hilmar plays the game...? I guess that clip is fake
---
&gt; I would even argue that the total ISK value on dead ships total with Rorq's are larger then the ISK total on POS fights.
---
Nope, it just switched from Ratting-Carriers to Rorquals. It just goes with the multibox-afk-PvE meta (I hunt since 8 years). When Carriers were multibox-afk-able (with Sentry Drones back then) and most used ISK-Maker these were our main prey. Now they apply too good to subs (hunt through wormholes)  and are replaced by Rorquals in the afk-PvE-Multibox-Meta ...
---
I for sure thought the Legacy/Winter titan numbers would be a little closer
---
Nuclear Weaponry on earth = Supers &amp; Titans in space. Got it.
---
Are you using skill farming to keep your other accounts PLEXed? It's currently profitable to do so, although it tends to alternate from profit to a slight expensive (low hundreds of mil ISK per account)
---
I've always taken that part of canon to refer to the effects of the warpdrives on the vessels (which are known to interact with the fabric of space-time through their sheer presence) rather than the vessels themselves, since the idea that a mostly hollow object a mere 14-18km long could have a mass significant enough to create great enough tidal forces to affect planetside life, much less end it, is kind of absurd.
---
Not to mention the fact that the Amarr parked four of these things in orbit of Oris, a planet in their home system, which blows that theory further out of the water.
---
CCP really needs to lay down some consistent canon TBH.
---
Goons 2019 - wHy WoNt AnYoNe FiGhT Us??

playet wow years just befor eve, and still missing, and my dream was to play vanilla.. And now there its, but dont have time to play a game like wow..
---
Not an alpha and I use safe and cloak for scanning.
---
I check local and d-scan quite often
---
What is dotlan.
---
Should I check it after creating a safe outside wh or cloak immediately and check?
---
Hi.  Aerospace engineer, specifically structure engineer with Boeing here.  The ISS is literally kept cool with giant fuck off radiators.  To achieve true adiabatic system status, you need a lot more than just vacuum.  Hell, its  it even possible to do with any currently known physical materials (or lack thereof).
---
I know you're trolling, but trying to emulate the old goons' edgyness then saying you shouldn't call people retard is pretty weak, try harder next time.
---
Yeap, CCP could make a doomsday clock, indicating minutes to EvE destruction, driven by the super gap between the two largest blocs in game. :P
---
I guess you could be "living" with at least one alt inside to scan you back. 
---
One single character, yea, sooner or later the nasty would happen and you'll lose your way in.
---
That's not how it works retard
---
Some of them are literally the cancer of cancer.
---
That’s true, I find the more plex in my cargo the more people would feel bad about shooting me. Keeps me safe going through LS
---
I think the ratios are close, with imperium / legacy there is going to be a lot more zkill activity due to them being able to yolo on roaming gangs w/o any real fear of a counter drop prior to the deployment. That being said the game is pretty much end cycle. Only thing that could bring life back in is a massive nerf to titans and supers as it is only one entity that has them anymore that pretty much controls server wide production.

Not quite, whichever side has worse effective tracking will try and match transversal as best it can.  
---
So in this case the Sleipnirs have far worse effective tracking, partly due to the MWD.  
---
However it's not an issue because they're also faster and can fully match the Vagabond's transversal.  
---
On the other hand if they got scrammed and dropped to ~240m/s the transversal would be the difference in speed (~730m/s).  
---
That difference is treated as a perfect orbit and at that point they would have a hard time tracking outside web range.
---
In terms of logs the dev version logs some info in the console when the ships swap ammo or adjust their preferred range.  
---
Outside of that, generally you can work out what's happening by tweaking things and observing the impact.  
---
In your case if the starting distance is 33km not 35km then the Vagabond dies after 12 seconds and both sides have much higher application.  
---
Since the Sleipnir is faster that tells you it's kiting away to make use of it's range.  
---
More generally if two turret fleets are shooting each other and both have fairly low application then at least one of them is trying to out-range or out-track the other.  
---
Alternatively you can often spot it by keeping in mind their optimals and seeing how far apart they sit when they fight.  
---
In that specific situation kiting is the wrong call but it would be correct with slightly bigger fleets.  
---
Note the answer you got earlier isn't correct, so you'll probably want to read my reply to them.
---
there needs to be some fracturing of goons. any directors want to delete the alliance or something? start a goon civil war? goon on goon violence?
---
obviously should be a natural fracturing, not at all advocating for CCP to step in lol
---
Spoken like a player who uses the hard work of others for your own gain while never doing anything to actually defend the things you use in the game.
---
But you did type out a heartfelt post and thank them. There's that.
---
It's pretty muck like this:
---
Yes I joined (insert mega coalition name). I'm gonna be space rich. I'm gonna buy (Insert expensive ship name(s)). I'm gonna have so much fun after!
---
Few months later:
---
(While looking at vast amount of isks/expensive ships) Man this game is boring as hell. All these fleets and pings are no fun... I'm not paying for this anymore...
---
pirate sites only spawn c1-c3, so no need to look for them in c4+

ESO doesn't have open world PvP for one.
---
From a planetary destruction perspective that could be how they  work, pulse lasers in real life generally work because you can throw more power into them, then pulse down for a cooling cycle. There are very specific applications for them, such as precision boring, because continuous beam works a lot better for cutting stuff.
---
No reason too.. they enjoy mining in safety lol

EvE is too hard for you, sounds like you should be playing a game like [https://store.steampowered.com/app/835860/Dreadnought/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/835860/Dreadnought/)
---
But you said “there doesn’t need to be anything” implying the server is fine as it is, not “the goons won’t do anything”
---
Would probably be one of the biggest moments in eve history if some goon directors flipped for whatever reason and just deleted the alliance, would be hilarious.
---
I have 0 idea how alliance mechanics work so this is probably not possible
---
Not quite.
---
Nuclear weapon posture on earth is governed by MAD, or mutually assured destruction. The principle that the largest sides all possess such large quantities of nuclear weapons that any first strike would be followed up by an assured second strike capable of destroying the initial attacker.
---
EVE doesn't work like that for a couple of reasons.
---
The first is, if everyone else went all-in together, Imperium has so many supers and titans that they could ride out any attack, counter attack, destroy their aggressors in their entirety and still have overwhelming superiority even after any losses.
---
The second is that in EVE you have immortality.
---
Glad i got out of null in time. 
---
And i was goon. :D
---
Seems good to me.
---
They only get counted if they are involved in a kill. So the WinterCo botting supers/titans would not be counted.
---
And it’s an equally sandbox decision to just say “fuck it” and let shit hit the fan
---
Pretty much
---
Whelp the supers, go out in glory and fire, or not, doesn't matter.
---
I emulate no one. I am me. It isn't edgy or a troll at all.
---
I did enjoy your salt. Twice now. Now that is a troll.
---
I think it's beyond keepstars now. 3 regions are being burned to the ground.
---
Basgerin? fucking shoot first, rip
---
this
---
If anything, the numbers are further apart, since PGL hasn't really let supers get used since he is waiting for shield slaves
---
ha!! after our edits, your post has no context anymore!
---
Solo and learning high skill cap mechanics: you'll probably enjoy solo nano cruiser pvp. Start out learning the ways of frigates and destroyers in faction warfare space, and you'll find you can go anywhere. Anything between explorer and pirate is the life for you - but either way always be ready to fight.
---
Check out Suitonia's "eve is easy" vids for some content, and go from there.
---
It really is an honest living universe.
---
Dude same
---
Well done.
---
don't blame players for playing the game optimally
---
you don't need to do this at a large scale, if you want to actually fight leave goons and go to an entity that will actually get said fights, or make it yourself. Goons won't dissolve to get more fights because the vast majority of goons don't want more fights, and that's fine.
---
I'm acutely aware that the state of small gang/medium fleet rn is pretty bad, but even pretty bad is miles better than goon level of fighting, assuming you really wanna fight that is.
---
Why must the change happen in goons, and not in the people opposing them?
---
In this case get a yearly subscription.
---
Dude, i'm setting a corn field on fire for this one.
---
Yeah. Iapetans are about the size and mass of Keepstars in my estimation, so it's likely they'd have a minor effect on tides.
---
Everything you said is correct
---
PL is a shadow of its former self, skillu quit rather than become PL2.0 and also because of, exactly like you said, the direction of the game. 
---
the only thing keeping PL alive is /u/rageliner doesn't want to let an alliance he had a big part in maintaining the reputation of for years go to waste. PL has the capability of being "the big bad" again anytime they want to, but specific people hedliner needs to get rid of and replace with fresh blood just aren't going anywhere, causing immense stagnation. 
---
Under doomchinchilla, despite taking on RTSQ, P3AK and LINJ, PL supertit numbers *fell*, what does it tell you if super &amp; titan pilots of the "biggest &amp; best" super titan force in the game are unsubbing due to dissatisfaction?
---
DREDDIT IS RECRUITING.
---
If age mattered, NC would still have 3 regions not on fire.
---
It isn't really. Since goons have had the alliance deleted once (maybe twice) they have the roles set so the bare minimum people have access to alliance executor roles. I wouldn't be the least bit suprised if mittens was the only one with the power to kill the alliance. Good luck trying to convince him to give that up
---
To be fair, its about all there is to do in Null. God help those renters though...
---
With the invasions, the abyss and other improvements to PVE, we're getting closer and closer to some viable PVE option. Why not just make a PVE server for more casual players. 
---
Start fresh.  
---
Space is big enough, but we might need to add some restriction on the number of POS someone can own, quality over quantiy.  
---
Keep some kind of PVP Arena with reduced ship replacement cost.  Player can bet isk, win cosmetic, whatever.
---
Add tough raids-like content where all kind of ships is required up to some Titan.  
---
Maybe some people would leave the PVP server and join the PVE server, so what? CCP gets the money anyway. However, how many new players would join up?  
---
EVE is pretty much the only solid space game out there right. It got the best ship variety, awesome graphics, the best universe, the best lore, player driven economy... All the infrastructures is already there, it wouldn't cost much to get it to work.  
---
It's not like there would be any kind of competition.
---
No man sky?  Not even an MMO
---
Elite Dangerous?  Not even an MMO, lack of PVE content.
---
Star Citizen?  (by the time it get release you can start and finish EVE 2)  
---
Dual Universe? (still very early in development, and I don't even think there will be any kind of PVE anyway).
---
Oh, NCPL are doing the smart thing by not fighting us. No one sane denies this. However, we are absolutely going to ridicule them for being powerless after being on top of the game for so long. Not to mention, we're going to ridicule them for their hypocrisy in suggesting that our similar actions in 2016 were somehow the wrong tactic.

Dotlan is a map tool that details activity in a system, you can use it to roam around safely by checking in advance if a system is active or not. So let's say your wormhole gets you in T-J6HT in Delve, you can check it for activity in NPC and ship kills [here](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/T-J6HT). You can see that there hasn't been much activity recently, so it's safe enough to scan (especially if local is empty, which it usually is). From there, if you check the Delve map in Dotlan, you can check the surrounding systems to see how active or not they are and plan your route accordingly. The goal is to go to inactive systems as much as possible, otherwise you might run into a gatecamp and get blown up, or the locals might get tired of you roaming around and setup a gatecamp just for you.
---
For years Goonswarm had to fight in a simular manner when NC/PL had almost all the supers in the game , 
---
my first years in the game me and my buddies mostly stayed in small and mid size groups trying to have fun and usually at some point PL would show up and wipe everyone out because they were bored.
---
and they did that again and again to almost every group around , and now wonder why the enemy has grouped up in mega coalitions to do the same to them.
---
Right, and also factoring that the last major time Panfam used their supers was during Init's failed deployment, we're creeping past the 3 month mark now (in the interim we had sub-super deployments to Drones, etc).
---
Well they are pets what do you expect
---
The alternative is to grow your own organisation and compete for those players.  I admit this is very hard given how well organised Goons are, from an out of game IT point of view more than anything else.

Because they're the largest power in the game and the ones closest to turning Tranquility into Serenity?
---
I miss red overlord. Great group to find in all timezones
---
Well that still leaves CCP devs :)
---
And the laughter of the Chaos gods
---
i subbed to this sub years ago in hopes that i would get into eve and learn it one day, but i never got around to it, and what I'm trying to say is this meme makes no sense to me at all yet somehow i find that hilarious. like some sort of new form of surreal meme.
---
Solid bait post, if I ever saw one.
---
Join a wormhole corp... it's the best decision I've made in the game. The corps are usually much more laid back, and the game is just better in wormholes. I wish I went that route years ago.
---
You would wrong. If you look at the average age of the Imperium titan pilots you could see if they were less than a year old. If they are, then those pilots were injected. Titan proliferation is a result of two factors. An increase availabilty of hulls and an increased availabilty of pilots. When you have the means to mass produce titans, all you need is the means to make the money to inject the pilots to fly them.   
---
"Why didn't NC/PL/Horde do it then?"   
---
Because the effect is amplified in coalitions and alliances with a huge amount of pilots.   
---
"You could have recruited and turbo krabbed like we did"  
---
Yes we could have, but the difference in hull numbers would be a lot closer without injectors and the average skill of the PanFam titan pilots could make up for *some* of the remaining gap.  
---
"Hurr something something ncdock something something salty"  
---
Yup.
---
Excellent!
---
Now drop a freeport and advertise the system to attract more radicals to the area.
---
Yeah whoops. Reverse c2 and c1.
---
we told everyone that supercaps were cancer for more than a decade and pl/nc claimed we were just bitter that we weren't elite
---
suddenly people are starting to realize that, just like always, Goons Were Right
---
CCP still said a big fuck you to all of them. If I pumped the gas out of your car one night and then filled it back up a week later, you'd still be pissed as fuck at me.
---
Please never let nullsec anchor gate guns.
---
Pirates are tanked differently depending on where they come from. So if you're fighting Angel Cartel, you want (optimally) to deal Explosive/Kinetic damage, but for Guristas, you want Kinetic/Thermal. See the list of damage types [here](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/NPC_Damage_Types). So figure out what rats you are shooting to figure out what damage to use. 
---
If you're starting out, just use the weapon systems you have the most skills in, it'll probably deal more damage than one where you are only starting out.
---
someone actually believes this?
---
None of this should happen. What absolutely needs to happen is that every single 0.0 entity either needs to blue goons or let them take over their space without the slightest resistance or content. Once 100% of Eve's primary selling point is controlled by 1 group CCP may just about realize how fucked they and their game are. At this point, we'll probably have some of the best drama posting on reddid for a while and then the game will either die or CCP will fuck gsf up beyond recognition.
---
Absolutely is, use a raitaru or asshouse or just live out of a mobile depot and be nomadic. What's your goal? PVP? Run sites? PI?
---
Eve always showed "online players" instead "online accounts". In fact, there aren't 30k people playing. I suppose Eve has like 10k unique players playing everyday, assuming the number I said is too far from reality.
---
The most important raise of players was when they release Eve as F2P. In fact, that's the only notable raise the game had from the beggining. Afterwards the players start abandoning the game after couple of days, resulting in a false feeling of growth.
---
I think there are two big problems in the game actually:
---
First of all, the game is suffering the biggest cold war with only few coalitions competing, these guys aren't playing Eve, they're playing like a Monopoly Boardgame in a major league that a single player, or smaller corps simply can't play because the spending of REAL MONEY (RMT stuff included. Yeah, RMT Stuff that CCP didn't notice or simply permits)
---
CCP aren't doing anything because they are filling their pockets with money everyday, with no real updates of the game. We can say the main problem of the game is Goonswarm, they're making the game boring, but CCP seems that they're agree. If privileges are taken away from them, the game would finally die.
---
You only have to walk around null in a frigate, and see how 30 titans drops to kill you.
---
The second one is the content… They're giving content, yeah. Recycled content of the same mechanic as always… It seems a Little bit inspired when they released mutaplasmid stuff, but there's only a mirage of content improving.
---
They prefer to loose a couple of players tan loose an Alliance like Goonswarm, that's the point of no return of CCP nowadays.
---
That's my humble opinion, sorry for my bad english guys.
---
Fly safe!!!
---
&gt;I think you underestimate the sheer magnitude of the value that is 5.6Gt. This is a weapon that can vaporise cities on planets, city-sized starships aren't going to fare any better when facing a direct hit.
---
I do not underestimate it, however, you are overestimating it. Here is a [NASA article](https://history.nasa.gov/conghand/nuclear.htm) explaining why. 
---
The TL;DR of it is that if the missile doesn't explode on the surface of the ship, even if the edge of the explosion is within a meter of the ship itself, it will deal no pressure or thermal damage to the ship, as there is nothing to transfer such pressure or heat to the ship. The only thing that will be hitting the ship is the electromagnetic (nuclear) radiation, which unless it's a non-combat ship, would be properly shielded from. Even non-combat ships would be mostly shielded from it because of all the radiation from the local stars. 
---
Now if the missile were to detonate on the surface of the armor, then any pressure or heat *not* directed at the ship is negligible, as it would be moving in a direction out into the vacuum of space. Essentially cutting your effective blast down to about 1/8th of what it would be if you weren't in a vacuum. The blast itself would probably only push the ship in the opposite direction a little bit (depending on the mass of the ship) but the heat given off is the threat as it might be able to melt through the armor and hull. It might take a chunk out of the armor too, but that depends on the resistance of the armor. 
---
Once again the biggest threat, though, is radiation, as a more concentrated source is right on your ship, it might pierce the shielding as such a large dose right next to the ship. But that also depends on how many tenth thicknesses the armor and hull provide.
---
Funny thing is, they do ...
---
The strategic reason is goons will not let a potential hostile power match them. You can try, but unless the leadership from the CFC hibernates for the next 5 years, you won't make it to the same level. It is only a matter of time before Legacy gets a little to big for goons to tolerate them anymore.
---
It is close enough to a perfect vaccuum to not matter with respect to convection. Like you said though, radiators also work through radiation.
---
nah, we good
---
How do you think the ISS and various satellites etc. keep cool? Radiators work, just not in the way most of them work in atmo. You do know that the very name radiator kind of implies radiating heat via infrared electromagnetic radiation? That's how radiators work in space. Plus as others pointed out, there is no place in the universe which is a true vacuum, there's always some random particles around, especially within a solar system.
---
Then why does Goon not all in on all others and end it once for it all? should be EZ PZ according explanation.
---
C1/Null is basically "I want to pvp, and support my habit making isk elsewhere or mining/PI".
---
Upside: not much that can get into a C
---
A massive nerf to super and titans would cripple any smaller alliance who wants to use them. **There is no way to undo the damage that is already done.**
---
nope its not ironic at all, mostly the convo goes like this
---
\*jumps into system\*
---
"haha wow you're undocked"
---
\*dies\*
---
"why don't you guys go and defend your home?/haha enjoy being homeless soon/\*links kill of some keepstar with &gt;1k people on it/etc"
---
True, but you are comparing a space station to giant cannons exploding.  A normal gun or cannon here on Earth can easily overheat and start degrading accuracy and begin to change the metalurgy...
---
no, I mean the salty retard part.
---
lol you got me
---
you can't have a C2 with HS &amp; C2 static
---
The only  combo with a C2 static is C2-C2/LS :)
---
Same way, with C2-HS there is on C1-C3-C4 static and With C2-0.0 it's either C5 or C6 static :)
---
I know 1 person who doesn't.
---
Legacy is growing nicely, Pandemic Horde is doing amazing job, both still not curbstompped.
---
Don't think anyone but those 2 have actually tried doing anything but bitch on reddit.
---
"best ratting system in the neighborhood" yet its the only one not claimed and with no ihub *thinking*
---
So, a product backlog?
---
You told everyone how cancer they were until you found a way (or CCP patched it in with Lifeblood) to compete and overtake. That basically makes you the same Hypocrites as PanFam, you just came to that point from the other side ...
---
The current iteration of Amarr Militia needs glassing. The biggest corps in the region just sit on their ass missioning while the People's Liberation Army and the rest of Gallanttean-Minmatar space suffocate the remaining militias.
---
I'm assuming you are just reading my flair and posting without reading what I typed
---
Exploration is usually a solo activity, no need for a corp. Like others have said, you will lose your ship at some point, but get used to it. Think of ships like ammo, they're very disposable. Just don't fly anything you can't afford to replace.
---
To distinguish safe spots from deadly ones, it usually comes through the dscan, if you're in wormholes, or by checking local and dotlan in null. If you see anything on the dscan (spam it constantly), other ships or probes, it means that someone's out there with you. If you're not cloaked, they also know you're there, so it's usually not a safe place to scan. In null, check for if there's anybody in local, ship kills/npc kills activity on dotlan in your system and the surrounding systems. Just find a quiet place to scan and you'll be fine.
---
1. It's a subscription game. Free to play is an extended trial. Subscription players get access to the bulk of the ships, skills, and content.
---
2. Very. Newbros can get into just about anything of the game's content very quickly. It's a learning curve, but once you climb it, you're going to have a lot of fun.
---
3. Yes
---
4. Not. Skill growth is passive, money grind is about playing smart not lots. Depends on the kind of player you are. Grinders can grind.
---
5. Not
---
6. No, and yes. It's a hobby that you're going to get stuck in if you like it.
---
7. Customizable in terms of fitting a ship: very. You can't build ship designs from scratch, which is good as there would probably only be one viable one 15 years in lol.
---
8. YES. Absolutely.
---
Because the people in power, like power.
---
Destroy everyone else and not only do you lose the ability to use a narrative of superiority (if everyone else is gone, who do you claim you're superior to?), but you also headshot the game itself, effectively no more major fights, so no more content, your players leave to other games and you lose your influence.
---
As a leader, it's useful to have an enemy to point at.
---
&gt;if you spend 98% of the time in highsec you don't have the means to build a supercap
---
gonna need a citation for that mate
---
Nanobots?
---
Might as well bring back mines, I like it!
---
take a look at your logic chap.
---
"a secretly PL sponsored entity sets up facilities in a panfam system to undercut the existing facilities it already runs there"
---
Just why? 
---
Most likely the campaign expanding to HS mogul assets is motivated by the fact that removing those HS trade hubs forces trade into trade hubs that goons derive income from via tax. 
---
We know that 2 years ago a  **Perimeter**  citadel and tax at 0.1% generated 10bil a day
---
Are they buying it or is that the sell price? Outside of Jita and probably Amarr (maybe Dodixie, Rens and Hek, but those trade hubs have shrinked considerably), you can expect all kinds of funky things in the market.
---
Sounds like you need a new activity.
---
Ah Boo. I was hoping we'd make this list so we got to check out where we stood among the rest of EvE
---
One could say the same for you. You didn't read what he said; he asked "why do we have to change?" The implication is that instead of begging us to disarm ourselves, that you (or anyone else not in the Imperium) nut up and do something about it instead.
---
\^this
---
Because you have to leave the anomalies to do it.
---
Hi, it's me. A U S T I N
---
What bothers me more is where does the box tax money goes? All this isk just disappearing...
---
Looks like most of the skillu space got aquired by Fraternity
---
I agree but injecting isn't cheap.  You need, what, 50m SP to be reasonably competent SP-wise (you know, DD V, Titan V, etc.).  
---
I do lament the introduction of injectors and the loss of the "elite" SP status of older, veteran characters.  But don't forget characters was always tradable in any case.  So it isn't as if you couldn't spend a lot of ISK to get a pilot before.  I agree supply was limited though.
---
&gt;the average skill of the PanFam titan pilots
---
Pressing a DD button requires so much focus and skill.
---
As I said in the post they responded to. Your leadership isn't full of idiots. If PanFam went to drones and turbo krabbed like everyone says we should, I would expect the next CFC invasion comes shortly after we re-establish ourselves. I'm not saying that we won't go to drones and try, I'm making an educated guess based upon EVE History and the public statements made by your leadership.
---
Let Bob sort them out.
---
I lost a battleship in lowsec to pirates because of my own hubris. I was drunk and a tackle frigate hugged me and because I was in a battleship I thought I was godzilla, then his friends came and turned my ship into a interstellar coffin with neuts.
---
His "guides" are terrible though. 
---
Horde school guides are good.
---
get several alts on Tayras on the spot as "storage"
---
It's probably best truesec?
---
Minmatar weapons tech is literally *nuclear weapons*, and is hundreds of years behind the times. 
---
&gt;  Capsuleers regularly wield weapons capable of generating extinction-level events on planets 
---
And a fair bit of the time, we use these extinction-level weapons on each other, not for war but purely for the *laughs*.
---
I'm not sure what's scarier, the level of weapons tech we have available to us, or how completely carefree we are about dropping it on people
---
Immortality messes with your head, man...
---
Do you honestly think that it would be a good idea for CCP to directly, with deliberate intent, clip the wings of the winner of the game? I'm not talking, like, game changes that obviously target one group's model of power; I'm talking straight up deletion of assets and other unsubtle bull-in-a-china-shop type maneuvers. That's what I assume you're asking for, at any rate.
---
Renters suck. Freeport that shit and cause as much chaos as possible.
---
No it's not cheap. The ability to generate massive amounts of isk from relatively safe income making areas makes it way easier to generate the liquid needed to mass inject pilots
---
Fool, that's the EXACT way to play this game
---
implying that a 100 veteran pilots are equal to 120-150 brand new pilots
---
your skills of perception are legendary
---
Remember when NC owned half the map?
---
Yes I transposed the c1 and c2 in my haste of typing.
---
Yeah they land rushed it in exchange for letting us make a ton of timers at the front lol
---
&gt;EvE is too hard for you, sounds like you should playing a game
---
FTFY
---
&gt;EZ PZ according explanation
---
Even if we wanted to and were capable of glassing everyone else, it doesn't change that it's a ton of work regardless, both at the line level and at the leadership/coord level.
---
I mean, we're happy for y'all to self-sabotage like that. I'm just glad we didn't think like that after we got rolled out of the north in 2016.
---
Yes, us "allies" tend to stick together, that's the way being allies works. "Us" as "allies" are committed to punting NCPL in the cunt, including this cute little alt corp. Deal with it.
---
I think that has more to do with general health (or lack thereof) of the game rather than individual leadership in PL. Game is in a bad state and a lot of playstyles are going the way of the dodo. People are unsubbing right left and center especially veterans that PL is composed of.
---
I think people are missing your sarcasm. :/
---
That explaind a lot
---
&gt; generate massive amounts of isk
---
This can be done anywhere.  North, South, East or West.  It's not exclusive to Delve.  The idea that you can generate massive amounts of ISK with ratting or mining in Delve is also overstated.  The MER is huge because there are so many players there.  
---
If you have a day job and/or can't be online running your characters 8 hours a day, your ISK generating ability is limited.  It's certainly *no more and probably a lot less than someone running a bot in drones 23.9/7*.
---
hahahaha
---
The people u are referring to have been out of the game for years friend.. time to move on
---
I'm not sure if serious answer will help or actually ruin it for you, but the pic is about hardcore PvE'er comes up with another and another reason to keep PvE'ing instead of doing anything else, slowly turning into "krab".
---
Taxes go to the corp that owns the structure. In player corps they're used for stuff (or a director embezzles them) in the NPC corps they just pile up until a GM occasionally zeroes out the wallet.
---
I'm not a member of leadership for NC. I have zero control over what the alliance does. It's just fun to come on here and agrue with everyone. I do miss our talks
---
The Mobile Depot could be an interesting option. How would this work? Would one character be able to host the depot and drop it, for another to deposit stuff into?
---
Something like this sort of setup - as lean as possible - would be perfect while I get a feel for the system and could work towards the paying in advance for the Astrahus as a goal.
---
In terms of what I’d be doing, all of the above really. Running some sites, with opportunistic PVP...
---
I'm not a leader for GSF either, but I still have individual agency.
---
Not like anyone contests until armor timer.
---
The name remains. Reason enough for us.
---
Eve Online has some notoriously shit corp/alliance names.
---
Depots are per toon, but you can always drop unprobeable secure cans and bookmark them. It's what I do if I'm camping a hole.
---
Congratulations.  
---
Now try to actually live there for a month
---
&gt;But I don't think it's way off, i.e. Imperium probably does have double the titans than PanFam.
---
&gt;panfam titans number in ~250, goon titans in ~1000
---
that is some damn loose way to interpret "way off" if 1/4th isnt way off from 1/2
---
&gt; based on a russian slur for jewish people
---
We definitely have no krab-related slurs for Jewish people.
---
I suggest searching this thread for word "krab" to hear different versions behind origins of the term:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/beog4u/slang_used_by_russian_eve_players/
---
We've been abusing the FOTM, just like everyone else, for more than a decade now. In fact, CCP tends to view our adoption of a given tactic as the bellwether for it to be nerfed. We have used this tactically to force change in the past, even.
---
Toilet Paper ...
---
Yeah but you said that radiators don't work in space at all... Anyway EVE is sci-fi tens of thousands of years in the future, I'm sure they have way better methods of cooling weapons than we have currently. They have a working FTL engine after all...
---
Traders who lose ships in high sec just quit the game they aren't going to bankroll enough to counter 10 tril a month.
---
A game that's won is over. If this is CCP's intent then no, goons should win, Eve, or at least sov 0.0 should end. If this is not their intention then yes. Absolutely CCP should intervene. How? I'm not here to decide but I'd start with either removing all titans and supers from the game or making them die by the hundreds when fielded (third option would be to make them literally useless).
---
Yes officer. This one here.
---
[ok got it](https://i.imgur.com/CIkkquk.png)
---
Because neither making major news with large battles or grazing into each others balls made players not go away. 
---
My opinions as an outsider to sovspace: I get the power fantasy in it, but I always thought of goons as somewhat goofy/evil/funny in the past. Fastforward to present day: I see them along side with the rest of new eden take themselves too serious. It's not really an observation rather the gut talking
---
...i'm going cry...
---
Very true, it was more of just my thoughts, it is just a video game.
---
As someone who haven't played since like 2015, I have no problem with whatever you are doing. Just pointing out that you aren't actually refuting anything.
---
Well considering lvl 4 missions are the same now as they were when Eve was small, at its peak, and today. You decide if they are crucial to retaining and enticing players to the game.
---
&gt;"a secretly PL sponsored entity sets up facilities in a panfam system to undercut the existing facilities PL already runs there"
---
not even in the same system - why would we run important supercap production facilities in a 0.0 entry system? it doesn't make sense
---
for mogul patrons it does because of the ease of access, but for us it makes absolutely none for the exact same reason - why would we put important supercap production facilities somewhere as prominent and obvious as the entry system into our space?
---
anyway it also didn't make sense to share m-o with a public facility because we already push our own index fees plenty high without pubbies pushing them too
---
like
---
anyone with any cursory understanding of geography or industry in eve would know that, even if there was an incentive to use the mogul structures, we still probably wouldn't because it would end up more expensive anyway
---
&gt;Most likely the campaign expanding to HS mogul assets is motivated by the fact that removing those HS trade hubs forces trade into trade hubs that goons derive income from via tax.
---
yes.
---
&gt;botting titans
---
ok then
---
I would say IRL carriers are the equivalent. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Gerald_R._Ford 
---
you basically just park them in range with a support fleet of the badguys and completely oppress the entire region.  
---
the list of carriers looks pretty similar to the one op posted too. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_carriers
---
Wait, do people seriously keep track of the fake internet points?
---
&gt; I'd like to point out that a Leviathan staggering its fire can theoretically launch one of these every *fifteen seconds*, giving it a damage output on the order of *373 megatons per second*. It's worth noting that all the explosives detonated over the course of WWII comes out to "just" 5Mt. 
---
And then you realize that the Leviathan Doomsday shoots several missiles even larger than the XL Cruise missile.
---
Not to mention the potential damage from the electromagnetic beam from the Avatar or the antimatter beam from the Erebus
---
I imagine the fallout would wipe planets if a space battle happened anywhere near orbit, might be wrong though.
---
Folks who PVE - Mining, Ratting, Anomalies, etc instead of PVP
---
I was curious and did some crunching. You're ofc welcome to check the math https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c20w9n/eves_cruise_missiles_are_goddamn_terrifying_heres/ergtuwc/
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c20w9n/eves_cruise_missiles_are_goddamn_terrifying_heres/ergtuwc/
---
Verdict is *way* more destructive (provided my math is correct)
---
goonswarm has never pretended we won't abuse broken mechanics.  we will tell ccp they're broken, then when ccp doesn't listen, break the rest of eve across our knee with them until morale improves.
---
nc/pl weren't ever going to suddenly decide that supercaps were bad for the game and stop using them until we dropped a bigger pile of them on their head, then suddenly every single pl posting alt is whining about how goons won't stop playing the game that nc/pl played for years until we took away their toys
---

Look at this guy. Lots of words for a cunt. I learned a lot in the last 24 hours. I learned how easy it was to bamboozle a bunch of retards to let those true colors shine on through. That's right y'all got jebaited. There are no AT ships at all. lol.
---
 Secondly, I never once said I wasn't gonna pay Casper back, but his bottom bitch Stig definitely assumed it. He did a great job helping me in giving a lot less fucks. It didn't help either that Casper only says anything to me if it's related to paying him back.
---
 After I lost his irreplaceable ship he sure made it clear I was not welcome on discord. He didn't outright say it. It was only until after I left amapd did that tune change.  I never asked for it, or even talked about it borrowing his moracha. He offered, and ofc I was like omg yuuus. No mention of you owe me 800bil if you lose it. Only after I lost it was assumed I should ante up 800bill. 
---
Friendship crushed over pixels. A sad day it is.

I mean leadership has not changed but GSF or rather leadership realized creating there own news bubble coupled with trying to get as many players in both helps on a meta level as well as on a get an audience of the crapy returns RMT.

Its recruitment post day! \o/ look at those sweet numbers in delve
---
found stainguy's sockpuppet account
---
big words from an adversity shitlord
---
**Reduced Resources -**
---
* Remove Null Sec Infinite Anoms Entirely
---
* Make Moons spawn Null and Low Sec Minerals ( maybe a smattering of high sec but very low?)
---
* Reduce Infinite Ratting Anoms in Null
---
* Low Sec would have a low amount of Null Minerals and an abundance of the mid minerals
---
* High sec should return to only the high sec minerals even on the moons and maybe a low amount of the mid minerals
---
* Remove the Triglavian mining anoms or make them a separate ore entirely (These were completely unnecessary and add even more minerals and now even morphite to high sec, this is ridiculous.)
---
* Leave Wormhole resources alone.
---
* Increased cost of Asset Safety Movement by like 10% (ust in general needs more isk sink).
---
**Citadels and Structures -**
---
* Remove Tether on Low Power Structures.
---
* Remove Timers from Low Power Structures and give it a 24 hour Stront Based Timer (I know, I know I changed position on this, im allowed to change my mind).
---
* Structures get their final timers changed to a week + Stront Timer while they are powered.  (Maybe Mediums just get the final week timer + stront?)
---
* Move Jump bridges further from citadels
---
* Make Cyno Jammers way easier to kill and in a shorter time frame.
---
* I'd like to see some Minor Annoyances to Sov Holders or even Citadels in general, like hacking service modules and making them cost more or go offline or something neat.
---
* Fine, Fuck it, I hate all of you but put in some kind of very low Passive Isk Generation Structure maybe that you anchor on a sun or something for you whiny 'Elite PvPers'
---
**Other -**
---
* Some kind of counter to titans or make it so they die way more?  (im not sure what but I would like something done).
---
* Something to detect cloakers in a localized radius (like around a single grid somehow and only then would I consider delayed local or no local, cloaky camping is cancer.)
---
* Resize the super carrier models so they are actually significantly bigger than regular carriers but smaller than titans.
---
* Logi on Killmails
---
* Dust 2.0 on PC connecting to Eve with a resource connection and eventually some damn influence on eve with specific Strategic FPS Ops (and I WOULD play it all the freaking time.)
---
* a mobile game that CONNECTS TO THE MAIN PC GAME and allows you to play and make some minor advancement in game while mobile ( like maybe a new LP store or something).  Hell even just being able to check my market orders via mobile or something would be BOSS.
---
* MARKETING - Holy shit CCP is awful at this and needs to do better in general.  Keep what you have now but add more actual advertising and reaching out to new customers.
---
* Maybe reducing the money one can make off skill injectors somehow?

you *really* dont need 50m sp for a titan pilot lmao, im pretty sure its less or close sp than a damn super pilot. There's absolutely no need to have even close to full 5's, *especially* in shit like weapon support skills, after all the use for these titans is literally dd cycle machines
---
The fuck?
---
you're less informed than the guy i replied to so congrats
---
RES does it for you
---
You have to kn out w scoots too understand.
---
No, "krabbing" replaced the term "jewing", which was more prevalent in the community than most people would like to admit these days.
---
The old word was anti-semitic, the new one isn't, which is one of the reason it caught on so quick I think.
---
Can any economics pro explain me wtf is going on with Geminate net imports?
---
More accurate to my experience at the time would be:  "Oh fuck, PL's out scouting/roaming.  Ship down to frigates until they go away."
---
I think mo is not in range of jita.
---
out of battle? sure (for example they can supposedly move their supers themselves without move ops, etc)
---
in battle? its literally pressing one button and waiting for a cd, come on
---
Oh, is that some sort of client-side addon or something? Okay, nevermind then.
---
Do not do this!
---
Your members will slowly start getting spodbrain and krabs disease... before you know it, your alliance will join a renter group to have more krabbing space or, even worst, end up in GOTG.
---
its definitely missing. you can only see the NPC bounties in the top 20 graph
---
you might be in hoover but everyone knows you from your racist 1488 neonazi adversity posting, so get fucked you cancerous shitlord. 
---
Everything I said is accurate, prove otherwise, or shut the fuck up.
---
What would be the point of playing a game like Eve with meaningful asset acquisition and loss if CCP just takes it away at any time?
---
We're provibloc and and everyone knows provi doesn't have soups
---
my guess is that its a super capital fleet that moved from another region to geminate.
---
Or effectively using hull energizers or cross refitting if you know you aren’t high on the primary list, heating active hardeners to possibly tank the volley.
---
What would be the point of playing a game like Eve, when the only way to do anything is to have more titans than your opponent?
---
Actually my perception skill got removed in 2010. Still got the +5 implant though
---
Where is SMA, lmao
---
It'a cannon.
---
yea but thats different than saying something has to happen. really, what would goons be able to do that would make you happy? delete their alliance? unblue init and test? its not goons job to make the game more fun and interesting for everyone else just like it wasn't our job back when everyone was telling us we were the problem of eve.
---
&gt;An increase availabilty of hulls and an increased availabilty of pilots.
---
tbh, I suspect a big factor (for casual GSF pilots) has been keepstars.  Sure, cheap hulls and injectors help, but so does not having to put a character in a coffin.  I personally had a pilot perpetually just-barely-not-a-titan pilot for the longest time because I didn't want to lose that character for $otherstuff.
---
(yes, I know it's a stupid way of managing characters.  I'm positive I'm nowhere near alone in having my titan pilot not be specialized.)
---
Size+1, N+1, Isk+1 or dock/tether/safe/perch. That's pretty much pvp in eve.
---
TFW you realize that after years of shittalking, most EVE players are actually WoW fans.
---
I've got a couple stacks of mines. In a few more years, they might surprise someone.
---
Blizzard just stole the most common activity in Eve. Nullsec population is already decreasing.
---
You do realize that "having more titans than your opponent", absent any wherewithal from those who are on the opposite side, only affects a small portion of the game, right? Eve's bigger than that.
---
now this is a hit piece we all deserve
---
**Right - This is JUST about the Mission running argument.**
---
I barely ever post on this here site (I remember when this was all fields ...#KUGU) .
---
Everyone knows that you can absolutely cream LP through mission running at high tiers and heck GMVA wrote the definitive guide on how to min max it, even though it's not "Proper Eve" - For the people that don't have 10 years furious LS pirating it's an equalizer that compares to NS site running and HS Incursions.
---
The problem is that the optimal ships for LP farmining like this are insta-warp and the mission content hasn't changed ever.
---
Sure we need changes to make them less easy to abuse and more difficult, so bigger more "vulnerable" ships are used but like any PvE system that's been untouched in eve in this many years .. it's not a priority and would take loads to fix.
---
The focus for LS PvP chaps (and chapessesses ofc) is fixing Ventures in plexes, standing loss from attacking neuts in plexes, more system control motivation and some LP Store balance passes.
---
Everything personal from your post? Not my business mate, go for it.
---
With 2-3 Nestor toons you can pull in about a bil an hour from that C5... No need to deal with PI
---
aka the business model of all the "newbro" corps...
---
As leroyvf said it’s a super fleet moving there. You can see the imperium super fleet moving in import/exports further down too look at pure blind and tribute.
---
its what eve people, long overdue btw, replaced the term "jewing" with.
---
DONT ASK DONT TELL
---
CCP: Mining seems to be a problem, what do we do? 
---
Wormholer: Nerf rorquals again
---
Mega alliance peon: It's not a problem, just reduce insurance
---
Everyone else: Lower ore anom respawn to be in line with asteroid replenishment rates
---
I don’t think any one cares anymore
---
Well i care &lt;3
---
It basically explains how you go from having a PVP dream to becoming addicted to maximizing your profits per hour, to the point where you don't end up doing so much PVP because you're always delaying gratification *just a little longer*, hoping for a sweeter reward.
---
 Grinding ISK in small ships   
---

---

---
In Goons if you want to join the relevant squad there are minimum SP requirements.  At the very least the tank has to be V.  I don't know what the total SP on it is though.  It's not going to be that far off.
---
Typically you want to do damage with the weapon system your ship is bonuses for, this gives far more benefits than ignoring those in favor of hitting a damage hole.
---
If you have a ship like the VNI or another drone/missile/or AC bonused hull that does not specify a type, they change ammo types to suit the rats
---
Definately the buy price, it's how I'm making money atm.

If all PanFam and/or FRT Keepstars are dead, guess which are next?!
---
i saw something about a number of the day today...
---
I was thinking that this morning.  A keep died and there wasn't a single post about it on reddit.
---
wrong Branch overtook delve in ratting. the graphs arent in the main MER. you have to download the raw data to see it.
---
The muzzle velocity would also be unreliable.  The non-missile weapons in EVE functionally hit instantly, presumably for balance and simplicity reasons.  The 16" shell from an Iowa-class battleship takes something like 90 seconds to travel its max range, 21 miles I think.  They have a 30-second firing cycle, so by the time the first shell hits, 27 more can be on the way.  The falloff and accuracy values are adjusted for balance and to reflect a projectile travelling on a ballistic trajectory without course correction; artillery shells travelling slower than railgun slugs travelling slower than lasers (which actually do hit instantly out to something like 300,000 km.  
---
A lot of things like this have to be abstracted and simplified for gameplay or balance but are in no way plausible.  Like, the artwork for what were originally Citadel Launchers drove me crazy, because they were gigantic on the ship.  I was like "there's no way a ship that size can hold hundreds of missiles that size and have the infrastructure to move them from cargo to magazine to launcher."
---
Well PanFam and FRT have the biggest hoarders of botters in New Eden **based on CCP data** so i am glad this sfuff is dying.
---
Came to thread expecting to see a booshing Raven while thread... instead had eve math on extinction weapons... left satisfied!
---
Thank you maths!

Isn't SMA in QFC? it seems odd to complain about Goons ruining the game while you living protected by that "umbrella" breaking the game

As much as I probably share your distaste for NC. It's hard not to laugh at this considering you left the OG NC out to dry after some token resistance and then cut a deal.

BRING BACK OLD STAINGUY, I AM SICK OF THESE GRR PANFAM POSTS

Bigger? Nope. Sov 0.0 is very small at the moment. You have GSF and blues from Pure Blind to Immensea. You have Provi, Panchinafam from Tribute to Wicked Creek and a couple of other insignificant entities. The distance and geography don't matter because most of 0.0 is empty anyway. 0.0 isn't a thriving, exciting place to be. It's a ton of empty space, some systems occupied by bots and a couple of areas occupied by actual alliances. Fighting for those areas is what matters, the rest is just buffer. There's almost zero variety in sov nullsec now. You could make it 10x larger and it would still be GSF vs Panfam in one, max two areas. Do you expect Provi to conquer Delve? Or maybe some of the renters would? Having a situation when to compete you have to have more than your opponent doesn't really work in this situation because to have more than GSF you would literally have to get everyone else together and you'd still probably lose.
---
Maybe you're the only who actually cares.
---
Congrats I guess?
---
I think I just had a stroke from all this salt
---
whats pvp?
---
Eve is bigger than 0.0.
---
Perhaps I should get checked out. I've ejected my probes where I didn't mean too more often than I'd like to admit.
---
But if PF isn't using them as much, the 250 is probably on the low side.  Maybe they have 500, in which case OP's math is in the ball park.
---
I wouldn't really consider that a mass use either. I think a more realistic "use" would be the TEST deployment to Oijanen
---
Gives me an idea...
---
Nerf autocannons slightly, allow heat sinks to give damage bonus to autocannons also. Suddenly you see 2x gyro 2x heat sink madness and autocannons are good again.
---
Not a lot though.
---
I don't think anyone is disputing that anymore :)
---
you can disable this in reddit options and see all posts.
---
Stop, STOP!
---
I can only get so wet.
---
Move to wormholes, never worry about titan counts again.
---
Hold a jack plane to anyone's junk and you'll see some real shrinking wood.
---
He's delveguy now
---
Dunno when we trashed 98% of that Raven fleet they dropped on that Rorq, pretty sure every super and titan active in NC and PL at least got on that mail. PH ones you are right, they would not be recorded.
---
If we go back to the TAPI deployment then you're right we're wayyyyyyy beyond the 3 month mark.
---
This is a great idea.
---
Way ahead of you there mate. Still, AD 2010 0.0 was probably some of the most fun I had in Eve. Call me nostalgic but not having supers and titans dropped on your solo roaming Hurricane was actually quite fun.
---
This was my fault, forgot to publish the grid and barchart. 
---
It's included now.
---
this. and it's in a pocket and not on a highway without ice. so my guess as a wormholer btw is that nullpeople would prefer to rat there
---
I LOVE YOU FRUITY RUDY!
---
if you can broadcast for reps you can use a hull energizer, the same for heating, and that's when you don't have people already calling the enemy volleys for ya. I will give you that tho, you might have to press 2 buttons at one point if you are one of the targets the enemy might call in each tidifest.
---
The thing with titans is that it makes sense to use them in battle in mostly 2 moments: if you want to end the fight by overwhelming hard the other side or a tidifest titan brawl. The former is self explanatory and the latter is less a case of someone being experienced and more a case of them managing to pay attention for that long and not be on netflix at the time of his targeting(and the server cooperating).
---
So based on comparisons to last month, delve seems to have lost about 8t in mining/ratting income. I think goons might actually gain more by staying home than Panfam will lose due to the goon deployment.
---
I fly into suicidal fights screaming WITNESS ME in local.
---
My corp is so scared of that they even refused to deploy for a week there to kill spodbrains and drop an astrahus because "we might end up liking it"
---
come back and join Brave Newbies for a while maybe ? Easy to get in, easy to move to staging, decent IT infrastructure, and constant action right at your doorstep. That'll make your coming back nice and easy. Then you can feel free to either stay or move.
---
Some people took advantage of free fuel and safe moving to make 10 bil profit on Avatars and Erebus hulls.
---

---
also he constantly misspell damn even if you inform him that it is incorrect...
---
What will you do when you finally "won"?
---
What I'm trying to say is that you're doing that thing where one laser focuses on one narrow slice of gameplay, and focuses so hard that they forget everything else.
---
the other systems got ihubs and tcus AFTER we deployed ours. it was all completely empty before.
---
Null is the safest space. If you want danger, come to wormholes.
---
Look up “warp to me incursions,” they run highly accessible shield incursion fleets.

So calling it carebearing is old fashioned now? Guess this game has been around for almost 20 years

Looking at Provi's super "numbers" I genuinely think we're listed there.

You have to know when to cycle your H.E in tidi, if you don't cycle it at the right time, the server won't catch it in time and it won't cycle before you eat a satchel of richards.

Underrated comment

Please do
---
And a lot of cash cows plexes dozens of characters into supers/titans. CCP can't just fuck them and nerf titans
---
Please tell me more about these smaller alliances using their supers and titans. Their only use for a small alliance currently is 1. Bridge 2. Meme drop. You don't have to nerf those aspects. A meme drop titan/super does not rely on ehp but not getting caught so an ehp would largely unaffect them.

Yeah no one cares.

NPC taxes are also used to reduce the amount of ISK in circulation and help fight inflation.

Judging be the import/export i think the northern fleet went from gem to vale.

us discussing such a trivially simple thing should be more than enough evidence of the situation, especially when you can have others call when to do it. Look i get it and ill give it to ya, maybe its a couple buttons sometimes
---
Factually inaccurate. Goons/CFC had x3-x4 the number of supers/titans that pl/ncdot did. I know this because I watchlisted them all and the difference was staggering. The difference was in usage, overall competence, and supporting capital fleets.
---
Going South by Chance Ravinne. Also Jurius Doctor and Divine Squire have GREAT educational vids. Be ready for several hours ofc of watching for those second two. The first is more of an entertainment film and imo gives good context to what we do in game.

What I'm focusing on is having content in 0.0. Let me remind you that it is you who are the worst offenders in the game of winning by not fighting. What was that quote exactly? "Helldunks or blueballs"? In a game that boasts being a pvp game this should never ever be valid and if ever a mechanic is discovered that would allow to apply this even in the slightest, it should be removed, nerfed, rebalanced INSTANTLY. Titans and supers, huge blobs, citadels, injectors, rorquals, all of these are components that make this situation worse and yet, CCP is happy with it. I'm not happy with CCP here. Focusing on narrow slice of gameplay... well, you're right. I want to have fun and if someone doing everything to make me not have that fun then fuck that person forever. As simple as that. I'm not expecting to convince you, you approach this game differently. Just like some people treating the amount of ISK in their wallets as the high score. Eve should be about fights and conflicts. If it becomes (as it already has in 0.0) about boring people to death, change is needed. And if those cunts that weaponize boredom don't like it, we'll... there's the door.

We called friends to die in honnor defending a fortizar against fleet of 40 dreka/gardians.

Alliance deployments tend to skew the values. The graph includes anything that jumps in or out, including piloted ships. Someone moved in/out and didn’t go back before the end of the report.

You shouldn't. CCP should. If they care about long-term life of Eve that is.

Could you "load" the heat into shells that you fire off, allowing you to dissipate most of the thermal energy by firing it at the other ship?

you forget that in pretty much every excercise where a carrier strike group have hunted a diesel electric sub, the sub has sunk the carrier every time

Do you think, this will change soon? As a member of the CSM, what kind of ' vibes ' did you get / got from CCP, regarding the stagnation and the dwindling playerbase? Are they even aware? Can we count on Hillmar after his recent words from Eve DownUnder? Thank you.
---
There is a subreddit called evejobs
---
That's the best place to start looking on here. The other 3places are the ingame search, ingame Recruitment channel and the eve forums.
---
Also, something that matters is what faction ur looking to join
---
The hobos own 2 systems but we aren't living there because the rent is too damn high!
---
The ISS is covered in radiators because radiators (not of the style you find in homes, which ought to be called "convectors" if you wanted to be accurate) *do* work in space.
---
Heat emission by radiation occurs due to the emission of photons primarily in the infra-red spectrum. This is also why/how thermal imaging works. Emitting photons into space is a perfectly acceptable way to deal with heat, whether in a true vacuum, or even on Earth.
---
In fact, there have been experiments recently to attempt to "beam" energy into space using an IR frequency that is not absorbed by the atmosphere - specifically because radiation does not require a medium to travel through (unlike conduction/convection).
---
P.S. Other races of gate guns are available. I'm not racist.
---
That's a good Corp.  Keep that corp
---
Hah, you actually remembered to include fuel payload and reaction efficiency! I see a lot of people forget those when they do yield calculations.
---
My main question is, what was the source of the image in particular used for base dimensions? I ask in particular because the in-game model viewer *is not* a reliable source of dimensions: Although it gives an 'axis' dimension for items, this is actually the "distance of 0" dimension for the ship in the game's engine (or, for turrets, the interaction radius with hulls), not the actual physical dimensions of the hull itself.
---
This is why when I did something similar, I actually used light missiles on a hull of known length (Kestrel) rather than the model viewer.
---
I thought that was a care bear
---
Because we all know this is a real indicator of who bot and who doesn't.
---
Not saying FRT and BOT are not full of it, far from it, but fly 15 min in Goon or TEST space and you will find the same. Probably because they are botting in a less retarded way.
---
That's a human issue, I'd say. How do you make people more likely to fight in a game if banding together is the optimal strategy irl?
---
&gt; Interestingly, the implication of this is that 1 point of damage is ~850kt, or 3.5 exajoules of energy.
---
Note that at least half the energy would radiate harmlessly off into space.  This is the reason that nuclear nations have mostly moved away from 1+ MT weapons, because they are far less efficient than multiple small ones made with the same reactive material.
---
&gt;I know that the 3-month active supers, that zkill shows, aren't necessarily representative...
---
I’m only asking since I know I can’t do it myself, but could you do a check on active supers over like a year or two and then subtract any losses or alliance changes in between? I don’t know if that’s hard or not.
---
&gt; giant fuck off radiators
---
My friends is a satellite engineer who once spent 30 minutes lecturing to me about how cool to me about closed-loop ammonia radiators are, so I know exactly what you mean, but its still a hilarious way to put it.
---
In game
---
I'm not, just genuinely curious if you'd be Happy with no real challenge left.
---
Every ratting ship is capable of botting.
---
No multiboxing
---
They will introduce Alliance CONCORD that will concord all out of alliance aggressors.
---
Are the radiators efficient enough to use some sort of thermal pump or Sterling engine to use the excess heat to turn a generator to provide for ship's power?
---
I never have done that. For a while it was super profitable, especially with the ghost training but to me setting up all that felt both exploitative and just too much hassle. I'm always skilling my active accounts towards something, so far i have never ran out of things that might be useful. Being an industrialist has helped, so many science skills for T2 invention. :P
---
Exactly. Goonswarm is not obligated to ensure the rest of the server "has fun".
---
Thx
---
I still don't understand what you're getting at. If random system started getting disrupted, is that not enough warning for the defender to be on guard and if they want their intel/information back then they need to go investigate. The great thing about this is the fact they will have no clue on what is near nor its size. Its "fear" factor is unscalable.  I don't see the problem with that as its beneficial for both sides and counter able.   
---
Now what you are recommending is AFK cloakie camping several systems around the clock that provides very little counter (other than baiting ratting). That gameplay is extremely stagnant and is too beneficial for the aggressor. My goal is to provide a more interactive gameplay for both aggressor and defender as I am completely against a playstyles with little to no counters. 
---
Lastly, you don't think a complex game like eve is failing when the only effective counter is spreading AFK alts throughout a system? IMO that is not only lame, its boring and could be a much more interactive play style on both sides. Game needs balance not broken and passive interactions. I feel it shouldn't reward someone who logs in and either watches TV, goes to work, goes to sleep, ect and periodically checks to see if someone is actively playing.
---
what other ships would you recommend? ewar on this scale seems perfect for a recon role.
---
Did CCP release data on botters? 
---
Strange how that was never posted to reddit.
---
Uh, yes? Absolute victory is cool and good.
---
because your invasion have gone great for you so far
---
What if they tell you ""you have low skill, you're useless and you don't know how to play the game" because you jumped your titan instead of bridging?
---
You have missed the entire point of my post.
---
I'm still mad for those smartbombing titans and rorquals tbh, but I loved the concept so fucking much.
---
Wow that is a good comment. So blackops battleships. I can agree with that. updating the OP.
---
From where did you get your numbers to say the decline it's so steep?
---
That's what we called them years ago before I took a 3 year absence due to family medical stuff, but now that I'm back I've learned the new term...
---
Still not sure where krabbing came from label-wise; is it because they are pinching at little things with their claws?
---
Panfam getting their home regions burnt down is literally doing more damage to goons than anything since WWB has done.
---
Yes it was, also it was posted on reddit. Goons attacked north under the flag of purging "bot hoarders"
---
Actually FRT have the biggest and most battle tested bot pool, as serenity allow bots.
---
well, I joined BNI few days ago, so I moved all my need to the staging HS hub, then I installed the home clone on the HQ and boarded my corvette, i had to make only few jumps to HQ in GE-xxx, i moved carefully checking the gate etc. etc. but after the very second jump i got caught in a bubble, so i waved "hello" in local and let them kill me and my pod.
---
I think that depends on where are you going and if your alliance in a war target.

You positioned like you didn't understand a keepstar grid.  x-47 armor you lost a straight up brawl even cheesing the tether after doomsday mechanic.  x-47 structure you fucked up your positioning again, or rather pl cowarded out by dropping out of range.
---
Historically have you ever won a major supercap brawl?  b-r was another disaster for you.  
---
I think you were only ever 'good' when you would go against groups that could offer no resistance to an iwin button.

who?
---
So what happens after goons has burnt down panfam's renter areas? A lot would go over to goons I'd imagine. Just give it enough time and they'll get up on that list ;)
---
99% of perma bans is for botting/client modifications/RMT
---
Krab/krabbing came about to replace the former antisemitic lingo.
---
GOTG is helping them attack Panfam though...
---
They gave out some data, nothing terribly good but the best TLDR I could get was that fraternity treasury and goon renters in period basis and paragon soul bot a lot. I am still hoping for 12 month or year to date info.
---
I cant wait to play eve online today and mine
---
Y'all are some fucking next level nerds.  Holy shit this is awesome.
---
Mining/ratting/PvE in general instead of PvP.
---
Now this reeks like a whole new leve lof salt.
---
Nothing. It's just correlation.
---
I do remember them teleporting known botters to highsec, but CCP didn't send many from Panfam which I found odd. Especially if they group is as full of botters as a number of Goons like Stainguy claim.
---
I guess BOZ1 isn't big enough to show up on the map.
---
This isn't from the last week, but I just rejoined in this last week, and this was a nice battle tale I have from 5 years ago.
---
I was flying in a BLOPS fleet somewhere in Gallente/Caldari Lowsec. It was with a blops corps, but I was a friend that was just in for some NPSI fun. I was triple boxing an HK, a Redeemer, and a Widow. Redeemer was a bridge, and Widow was honor tanked (because back then you could just use ECM as tank).
---
We jumped in and did some pew pew of some kind (I'm looking back and can't seem to locate any kills from this operation, so idk what the fuck was happening).
---
Well, we're taking the fleet back to staging, and a recon missed the bridge, we know some people are trying to find us, but I cycle the jump portal a second time (the rest of the fleet has left already) and I see combat proves on scan.
---
Literally maybe a second before the portal cycled down, a falcon decloaked and pointed and jammed my Redeemer. Fuck.
---
Our HK in a loki was nearby and watching and asked what to do, and I told him to relight the cyno, and he did. Every other person in the fleet was like "fuck no we're not going back". They had blingy ships they only wanted easy kills with.
---
Well, the cyno was already up, so I jumped my Widow in, set all the jammers on the Falcon, and we moonwalked out as the fleet landed to help the falcon. The loki somehow also got away, but I can't speak to exactly how that played out.
---
I pooped only a tiny bit when that happened. I wish I had recorded it because I would rewatch it again and again for the pure thrill of having lived through it.
---
Ohh i tought it was Evan, didnt no there is some1 worse
---
CSM candidate being pushed by RMT facwar mission runners as a savior of FW.  Former FEDUP saboteur.  Pro-PVP at the ballot box.  Pro-RMT in the confession booth.  
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/76696641/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76696641/)  
---
Because facwar pilots can act as a bloc when pandered to, we have a decent enough vote share that he might just get on.
---
Haven't played properly in a week+. Fucking wish I had more time to waste in my life right now.
---
I've heard that, just not why the term Krab/Krabbing was selected as the (much better) alternative.
---
One of the many bits of lore I missed in my absence
---
Null sec everywhere, no concord.
---
Constructible stargates.
---
No asset safety
---
No PVE ISK printing from nowhere, ISK backed by resources.
---
No private spawning of resources, such as agent missions or Abyssal space.
---
By causing banding together in huge numbers to have significant drawbacks, adding more people to your group should really decrease your share of the pie.
---
There are no worries about needing more houses, more food or more energy like you would have IRL, your keepstar has infinite hangars and your colossal respawns fairly quickly every time you mine it.
---
every Chinese is programmed to bot
---
I already have at many points. I pay for 3 or 4  out of the 15 accounts I keep subbed and that allows me to get ahead by at 4-6b/month infront of other people.
---
Also if you want to donate in the name of science, I'll go fight a relatively equal skilled player but I get to have officer mods and high grade implants and they get to have t2 mods and no implants. We can see who would win.
---
NC is a funny way of spelling Divinity
---
Nice. Were you working out of a citadel/pos? 
---
I'm looking to do this but with just an Orca as a base. a c3/null might be a good starting point for me, since I won't have any forced logistics like getting starbase fuel.
---
Yuck
---
the dumpster, where else?
---
panfam had about 400 titans in x-47, so these numbers arent  entirely accurate for everyone
---
Most people with more than 2-3 accounts afford them using skill farming because beyond 2-3 main characters, most characters are usually specialized enough that they don't need training anymore (ie: dedicated hauler, ship-sitting alts, farming alts, PI alts, sabre alts). It's a bit of a hassle, but it allows you to maintain a large amount of alts for essentially free.
---
I did it out of an orca, then a POS and when citadels came out I put down an astra. Logistics are easier than most assume, every day there was a c2 or c3, HS every other week. A few alts for scanning and rolling and you’re good, go for it!
---
NC can make all the excuses they want. At the end of the day Goons logged in and played the current game as is. NC stayed logged out and refused to adapt. It's just simple cause and effect.
---
You can not make PvE fun without changing the fundamentals of combat, and I don't see that happening ever.
---
Well I mean that even the actual numbers will be interpreted as "Imperium still massively outnumbers everyone else" and not as "PanFam is close to matching Imperium titans".
---
This post screams salt more than anything I've seen to date lol
---
You've become SoyGuy.
---
True.  But right around 2013 the accusations of botting replaced the Mining rubles to feed babies memes, which replaced cries of Logoffski! as the dishonourablest combat tactic of the earliest days.  We've been a silly community right out of the gate.
---
Fair enough. Wasn't sure as a number of people are claiming those were all for botting, and without more data it proves very little. Especially considering a number of those alliances haven't been around for years.
---
Can confirm keep going strong we have those gates in the oven
---
This is the data that peligro posted to twitter, it's 13ish years of date so it's skewed by (as an example) BOT having been around for a very long time while fraternity treasury having half the number of bans, but having only existed for about 18 months. https://twitter.com/CCP_Peligro/status/1126496159407792128
---
Tauren Alliance Please Ignore
---
Hold on there pumpkin the credits haven't rolled yet you're the high stack but shit can change.
---
Did I not send you pics of the car I was working on? I did however leave abyssal discord last night, that may have been our last mutual server? A friend request is always an option :-)
---
Yeah, as others have pointed out it comes from Russian slang. TIL. I had the same kind of experience where I came back and suddenly everyone was using the new term.
---
It's terrifying to think that we have this kind of power and we barely give it a second thought.  Check out the [Eve Chronicle Xenocracy](https://fiction.eveonline.com/stories/chronicles/xenocracy) if you'd like to see a capsuleer decide to use that kind of power on a planet.  Here's an excerpt :
---
"...At this altitude, the gravity of your planet will augment the standard launch velocity of each solid projectile to speeds well beyond operational specifications, enough to obliterate anything within half a kilometer of the impact site.” Omvistus’s image grew larger on the screen before he continued.
---
“Anything between that location and two kilometers from ground zero will suffer a worse fate, as the antimatter suspended in each shell escapes its containment field and expands in a random dispersion pattern, colliding with the ambient normal matter on the ground – buildings, trees, children, everything. Whatever these particles touch will experience matter disassociation on an atomic level as, piece by piece, they are reduced to unidentifiable residual particles.” He paused briefly, and then concluded.
---
“With a single thought, I can reduce your entire city to a smoldering crater; the boiling wind rushing in to replace the void left behind will be laced with dust particles that were once the bodies of everyone you know and love. Do you understand?”
---
Or, if you want to hear that last from the capsuleer himself, [here it is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPS1Ysp3t_U&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=585)
---
Thats pretty much what happens mention  anything that hurts that precious panfam 'we da good gais' and you'll be downvoted to hell
---
then you'll be crying about how everything is super expensive and only mega alliances can afford stuff
---
When nobody else is able to do it, you gotta do your own economical damage too.
---
The pavlovian goon: 
---
a) somebody makes a negative point about your alliance -&gt; *salt xd*
---
b) you lost an objective and can't spin it -&gt; *already replaced hahaa*
---
When you stop playing from inside the blue donut you actually get your brain back. You should try.
---
you aren't considering the inflation rate that kicks in when Goons aren't home mining meaining ore prices will be high initially allowing us to cover those deployment opportunity costs
---
Yes it is far off. A fully skilled titan is around 45 million SP.  
---
Just the tank and the ship is somewhere in the 20-25 million area. Half of the titan SP is in spaceship command and gunnery.
---
Thanks
---
Open up the agency and click on the introduction/tutorial tab
---
Shell casings. Even regular earth guns use shell casings to help dump heat. In a spaceship setting i assume they would load a casing with max heat and dump it.
---
&gt; Do you honestly think that it would be a good idea for CCP to directly, with deliberate intent, clip the wings of the winner of the game?
---
Were you complaining when they introduced fatigue with deliberate intent to  clip the wings of the winners of the game?
---
I wouldn't place money on determining how much of it is botting or other sources, but I would imagine it could be similar overall percentages as the wheel translating into botting as well. Maybe just by population size or by demographic if certain groups are more likely to try to do it.
---
Anyone else feel like the title here, felt as dirty to click as a buzzfeed article?
---
Yeah I completed all of the tutorial missions except the four at the bottom.
---
Yup, just wanting to save up some money for plexing the accounts and outfitting such. Don't even have all my accounts reactivated yet.
---
Should be able to get 20 bill this month
---
Just click on the first one, its a intro to the career agents.
---
dont worry Redline, there are people that still love you regardless of where you are.
---
i felt as dirty as you by writing it. it's a loss-loss situation here.
---
Hi Falcon, it's Bill.
---
I believe that the only true way to interpret this data would be for you to use the super[trendy SankeyMATIC bar chart](http://sankeymatic.com/build/) everyone is raving about with each flow being a different NPC, tia.
---
"So, in what sub did we land?"
---
"The first line says 'Let's get into the maths."
---
"Ok, we're in /r/Eve"
---
Someone please do that new meme that's making the rounds?
---
no its almost all chinese
---
Everything is fine in branch, no botters at all
---
Ofcourse the reason for going to war is important, it defines the objective of said war. By your own logic, if finding fights was the reason why didn't goons just deploy their sigs? Isn't that the point of having them.
---
Instead you marched over your entire superforce to "glass" a region. That is a piss poor attempt at finding a fight. 
---
You spend the last 2 years chestbeating about your MER meta but won't factor in that your force is so large no other group can contest you in a pitched battle?
---
If ego/fights isn't it, what is the *actual* reason of goons being in the north?
---
TL;DR - Just jump to ideal solutions if yall want.  
---
Thanks for the response!  
---
My assumption here is that we agree on the following:  
---
A sizable percentage of content around cynos/inhibs is driven &amp; created by the current Rorq mining meta   
---
I believe it is this scenario where players often arrive at the notion that cynos/inhibs are broken, which has been popping up on reddit for awhile, hence this thread; but I disagree.
---
I believe that:
---
1. cynos are working properly
---
2. inhibs are in a decent place (perhaps a slight tweak in hp or timing to get it "right")
---
3. Rorquals are in a decent spot as a ship &amp; content generator for "resource wars", BUT because of their uniquesness &amp; panic, have broken cyno&amp;inhib gameplay, creating what I would call "an exception" or "perverse instantiation" of the existing mechanics (which I feel work well everywhere else)
---
4. The ideal solution to this problem should have minimal residual effects across the board
---
What I like about cynos/inhibs is:
---
* On this general scale for example: noob ship &lt; cepter &lt; bomber &lt; sabre &lt;  t3c &lt; BS &lt; carrier  
---
Moving from left to right, survivability/tank of the in-cyno increases as, tackle ability/timing/etc decrease.
---
* As the size/strength of the defender on-grid goes up, the gameplay must adapt, requiring the aggressor to use either a more durable in-cyno, or stacking cynos such as: throw away bomber &gt; jump a carrier to it &gt; and re-light tanky new in-cyno (or perches as you mention) This content is all highly dynamic, but it is also the genesis of the "pre-lighting problem" due to the uniqueness of rorqs.
---
* has the cute little affect where if the cyno gets dumpstered AS YOU JUMP, you get thrown willy-nilly into the system. I would LOVE if this effect was expanded upon in some way as a possible solution side effect to umbrellas projecting too much but I feel this is a dream, and not a reality.  
---
From here, I believe more energy should be put into looking at the rorqual scenario as an exception, and working out from there, before trying to modify cyno mechanics and creating residual effects elsewhere.   
---
My ideal solutions (in order) would be:
---
1. Completely restricting cynos from rorqs (because of their existing uniqueness) to reduce residual effects across the board, and force the defender to require a dedicated cyno ship. This doesn't resolve the "pre-lighting problem", but would transfer it to another scenario of keeping a brick tanked, cloaked carrier on grid or something stupid like that and could be spicey fun. If the issue persists, ADD #2.
---
2. Scaling "Jump time" of ships similar to warp speed; IE large ships take more time in the jump tunnel than smaller ships (doesnt have to effect bridging subs, but could). Triage my have a bonus to "jump time" for obvious reasons (this alone doesnt solve prelighting, but reduces the "instaneousness" of umbrella responses) (unsure how/if/should this effect(s) gate travel) (as a bonus, a dying in-cyno is more likely to throw caps randomly into the system in other pvp&amp; combat scenarios) If 1 &amp; 2 dont work, move to #3, keep change #2, remove change #1.
---
3. Adding a restriction to a cyno such that, when fitted to a capital, will force a spool time before cyno can be jumped to. The spool time itself being closely related to and balanced around the activation/anchor time of an inhib. (I think this solves the issue, of super tanky shit pre-lighting cynos, but i dont think it should be implemented until #1 is tested. This should also be implemented in conjunction with #3 below if possible)
---
(This is my 100% spit-ball idea while at work response that doesnt consider cost of implementation &amp; dev time)
---
7/8th of a fuckton is still a buttload. So still a losing scenario for the eve economy
---
delet gons
---
No gates or stations in null. No stations in low.
---
At least until players build them.
---
Meaning to colonize a region you'd have to use wormholes to get to both sides to erect a gate between the systems.
---
And NPCs being more threating in lower security, attacking structures and trying to hunt players.
---
Not sure 3 regions on fire need a spin.
---
"a fully skilled titan is around 45 million".  No, that's not "fully skilled."
---
Also way more fury inducing when you bridge a fleet to a strat-op and someone sneaks his freighter in too.
---
Ideally also having a main resources that fluctuates around so that to be the top you would be forced to invade places.
---
1) supercapitals are deleted from Eve online
---
2) excavator drones are deleted from Eve online
---
3) 3 more regions of perfect truesec are added next to Branch and have only like 2 entrances
---
I've got hundreds of hours in Kerbal Space Program. I can confirm.
---
Null is by far the safest place to be
---
Because removing asset's from 1/3+ is a good way to help the game survive.. For reasons?
---
I ganked a gankers scout last night, he tried to gank me, but I didn’t feel like getting ganked, so I pulled out.
---
This is where my money tank comes in handy.  100 Krabbing Resist.

gotta have space to mine first nancydot bro
---
When have we said we needed goons to beat fanfam recently?
---
They will come for the alliance tournament! Haha
---
Like next i want to see 'you wont believe these top 10 tips the IMPERIUM DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW'
---
not in nancy dot, nor pathetic legion nor pandemic '2nd class citizens' horde
---
also lol at the post being removed
---
Well we need isk sinks to balance out the isk faucets.
---
Not what I was talking about. Read the entire post.
---
Pretty sure the people standing in Hiroshima weren't just chillin
---
1/3? I'd say more than that. And yes, it would be a good way because it would get rid of one of the elements that make this game inherently unbalanceable and unfun. Sure, people would be angry... not exactly the first time that would've had happened. If done correctly, I'd say the majority would stay nevertheless.
---
&gt; stop being biology and start being physics
---
Ah that's a lovely quote XD
---
As if panfam would give up their own super 😂 how can they bully up n coming alliances n little guys without swinging they're dick at them?
---
I'd generally agree, but there are many voices in the game who have engaged in such hyperbole.
---
I like C5&gt;C5.  Roll your static with capitals, good isk making, not usually too tough to find some pvp content.  Main downside is sometimes having to be patient with logistics and finding k-space connections, but I prefer to stay in j-space most of the time so that's fine with me.
---
We would be scrapping npc loot for mins
---
It say you'd have a better response just pulling an ea and closing their doors the opinion is fucking stupid tbh ' oh you saved 70bil for that titan? Well get fucked it's deleted'
---
2019, when horde owns more sov than the rest of pamfam combined. GJ little beans!
---
&gt;This whole chestbeating on reddit because nothing is actually happening is the most hiv-positive shit that this sub has created in a long ass time.
---
An astero would be the minimum with a covert cloak, which you'll want.
---
Could a physicist tell me what the best way of disipating that kind of heat would be?
---

---
b/c is was worse than the typical bad on r/eve
---
Very cool and interesting
---
oh god, you're right.
---
A keepstar died in a goon controller system right under goon super capital fleet.
---
Dang, you disagree... whatever will I do now... Fuck supers and titans. If it meant 0.0 would be even emptier than now if their (former) owners left - good riddance. Maybe then nullsec could start becoming fun again and not the horrible shithole I avoid at all costs it is now.
---
So if NC didn't defend it, and we didn't defend it in our own space... who does this count for?
---
Haha that's pretty good.
---
The difference in accuracy between a lightspeed weapon and a projectile weapon might make up for that if you are going to go full hard sci fy.
---
Most terrifying in your post is oxydising Beryllium, this shit is top 3 most toxic elements, releasing 23 000 tons of it for each missile sounds pretty life destroying to me....
---
1 keepstar not blown up 
---
2 keepstar not blown up
---
3 keepstar not blown up
---
What would make eve better is removing the cess pit that is this reddit and all players in it, like cutting a cancer from the body and if I go with it so be it
---
in what way
---
it died in a goon controlled system, under goon supercap umbrella, so I have some bad news for you.
---
I have the asteroid unlocked but not the covert cloak I'll wait till I can do both
---
If you are a goon, I expected you to know more about industry.
---
The cost of most of pew is unrelated to the cost of minerals.  The cost of faction/navy ships is about the cost of a non-faction ship (be it frig, cruiser, or BS) plus the cost of the BPC.   The cost of rigs is salvage, the cost of modules...   they are T1, loot drops, or mostly moon materials and PI for T2 modules.
---
Shoddycast, is that you
---
&gt;blasting people with missiles in my Midmatar frigate
---
Midmatar is when you play minmatar and smoke mids
---
Even ignoring mining value (because tbh I have no clue what prices they use for the ores), goons lost about 3 trillion isk in Delve NPC bounties compared to last month. To be fair, not every goon loss is in delve, nor is every loss in delve a goon loss, but Delve hasn't even seen close to 3t in losses since January 2018, when it barely exceeded 2.5 trillion.
---
Even ignoring losses in mining income, goons have probably done more damage to themselves by deploying than anyone has managed to do to them in the last 1.5 years or so. Impressive.
---
It will nerf bigger alliances and force them to spread out, making krabbing more risky since umbrella will be slower. Its just stupid that you can stuff like half of all nullsec players in just two regions.
---
simple: avoid "unsecured" and "forgotten" site,, this is all you need to know about data/relic sites in C1-3, because the remaining data/relic sites have pirate faction in their name.
---
and don't try to find sites in C4/C5 because they do not spawn pirate faction site.
---
you can use to find a new wh to farm.
---
I’m in love with the shape of you, shoot and scram like a nightmare too, now my hull is split in two, I’m in love with your spaceship
---
AKA, the golden age.
---
&gt;nothing is actually happening
---
good point, we better go murder eve-mogul
---
You're right, it was disingenuous. I just wanted to be contradictory. FWIW I don't think CCP should do what he's suggesting either, I agree with you that it would be a terrible idea.
---
They should probably do something though, I'm not smart enough to know what it is.
---
Dumb goons killing a keep staring in their own system
---
Can't be.. He was undocked in the start.. NCdock lost their undock button.
---
They kick them for losing supers and getting caught out at least
---
1. You weren’t able to post
---
I mean they have been nerfed twice, rorquals even more, and it still hasn't done much to Delve for example.
---
Anoms aren’t what gives you the best yieldz
---
Just start playing, when you get frustrated or bored talk to people in local, they are real people. There is nothing quite like eve. Don’t join a null block too soon learn to make your own game and then go play with others. Don’t burn out , it is a big universe.
---
I'm not in NC, nor does my alliance affiliation in anyway impact my ability to discern the utter idiocy your posting betrays.
---
the low tier alliances that grabbed skillu space thnking that they will hold it for more then a month before getting rolled
---
If only first person flying would actually work in this game
---
oh so you are getting your raw materials from some magic NPC ore spawner?
---
If mines come back I am going to focus an entire city to their distribution at cheap cheap prices.
---
Except when we leave to go back to delve our moons are ready and waiting where as in tribute you would have to wait 54 days to get a max frack.
---
how is there any way to compete? they can just squash anyone that even mildly competes. look at them vs panfam, it’s a wash. literally the only people that can beat goons are goons themselves.
---
Will definitely check this out! Need more podcasts besides TiS and small gang is how I play

5 WAYS TO GET RID OF ISK

s199 they close so good

Yeah I completely forgot that. Have completely reworked the main post and double checked numbers. Thanks!
---
Sure send me a decent Isi offer and I’ll defect
---
Im down i tried to click at least 5 times
---
Delve really is null Jita.
---
I’m not saying they’re obligated to. I’m saying thats the only thing that could happen to take them down.
---
RIP me
---
Well we clearly have a different idea about the definition of "something happening". Badposting while grinding undefended structures isn't really "something happening", it's peak boredom.
---
Send 500m to jibrish as your posting tax
---
You are right!  The cost of minerals totally kept people from being able to afford ships before the rorquals were allowed to mine.  And that JUMP in mineral prices after the rorqual nerfs!!
---
Snark off...  now go away.
---
That's my issue at the moment. Appear in local, people check out zkill, dock up. Come on dudes, I'm only 55% dangerous. I'm one of the shit pirates.
---
cool
---
Honk
---
Toodles!
---
Now now, no need to get upset.
---
After you
---
why would that make any difference
---
out of curiosity, where should us free and independent players go to find a new freeported sotyio?  asking for me and my fellow largely independent players.
---
NO U
---
Because nobody can oppose goons. They have 4x the titans and supers of everyone else combined.
---
Bovril finally made a good post
---
I think it's only like 9 days or something for the covert cloak.
---
So, you'll soon be off!
---
we would wish for goons to get a little braver but stay the same level of dumb
---
Let's give our logi bros some love
---
Shh they are nomads and victims who don't need no space stop ruining the narrative ffs
---
No u!
---
we should hide this gold source from eveonion and publish something ourselves.
---
How do you figure out if someone is a wormholer?
---
Just wait a second, they'll tell you.
---
What the hell is going on in branch...
---
I mean you can continue to be a nomadic elite pvp alliance roaming around the galaxy w/ a superfleet, but I promise you, that's going to end badly for you in 2019.
---
Good job. Now compute the force required to accelerate a capital artillery round to hit a target 250km away in &lt; 1s.
---
SWA has all those "veteran" players who were with BoB on their mains, but just want to chill in NPC land nowadays.
---
They offer the freshest advice to anyone who wants to listen.  (Even if you dont want to listen, youre still going to get their leet advice.  And youre a noob for not wanting to hear their wise words.)
---
They have the greenest of killboards from their time spent whoring on concord kills in Jita.
---
They would be unstoppable if they wanted to crush you and your corp, youre just lucky they dont.
---
Because these 0.9 belts arent going to mine themselves.
---
But dont shit talk them bro, or they will get their director friends in PIRAT/~~Marmite~~/CODE to come ruin your life for reals.
---
Holy shit Branch surpassed Delve in rat bounties
---
The one time I vote for a lowsec dude he went apeshit crazy... Gj lowsec dudes.
---
What the fuck is this post tryin to say?
---
there is an obvious and clearly visible increase in super capital proliferation across the...
---
...you know what, never mind, you're too far gone down the dumb tunnel
---
the year is 2019. it finally dawns on the gon that building virtual empires in pixel space for the sake of building virtual empires in pixel space is all in all pretty fucking pointless. a revelation that came to everyone else who ever played this game at least a decade ago.
---
space vegans
---
Very nice! Which corp is this btw?

Just for fun, I went to zkill and added up the losses in "recent" for goons, init, bastion, tnt, and lawn. It came out to a total of 12.382 trillion ISK. I assume "recent" counts the last 3 months, so that means the 5 main Imperium alliances lose a combined average of 4.13t per month. From ~2 weeks of deployment, delve lost nearly 3t in NPC bounties alone. It might not be valid to assume another 3t in lost ratting if they had deployed the full month, but I would be fairly confident in saying that a full month's deployment would cost Delve at least 4.5t in lost ratting bounties, which is around 400b more than the Imperium has lost, on average, for the each of the last 3 months. Even ignoring lost mining value, I still would say that goons deploying has done more damage to them than any of their enemies have (since WWB).

CCP is aware. The subreddit is full of "Does CCP even know X is a problem?" The answer is yes 95% of the time. The cases where they don't are obscure and isolated. CCP is often more aware of a given problem(or lack thereof) than the player base. The problem is one of prioritizing limited resources. This is also one of the places the CSM really matters.
---
I think the lack of investment in Eve has left CCP in a bad place after the failure of their various other projects. They bet Eve on the success of WoD and Dust and VR and Nova and probably others I'm forgetting or don't know about. While Eve is not yet dying, it should be in a much better place than it is. The repeated failures have cost CCP and so much of the resources that were once redirected are now simply not available.
---
That said, I think things have reached the point where CCP's only choice is to re-invest in the game or let it die and I think they know that. Hilmar's re-involvement in Eve is an important indicator. For us this is a game, for them this is their livelihood. For many of them, including I think Hilmar, it's also their baby so it goes beyond money.
---
Is carebear anti-Semitic? I assumed it was a reference to the cartoon show from the 90s
---
55% is a lot more dangerous than 90% that usually just pushes f1. Anybody between about that and 75% is the guy I know is a real pirate.
---
So your entire argument is opportunity cost? 👌😂😂
---
Well, one side is losing space...
---
Maybe, just maybe that's why a change must happen in others, because you just can't disarm one group because someone decided to not follow the meta.
---
White-Star (Cheese Party) - we are small though and german-speaking only. but we have a shitload of fun, get a lot of GFs and while we're not really recognized a lot, a few wormhole groups know that we exist and I think the general perception (if any) is quite positive so far.
---
Well that's very kind of you, I actually didn't realise that. I do kill a lot of shit but lose plenty since I get baited on occasion or pick fights I can't win. But that's the fun of it.
---
Goons being dicks, what's new. They're just basically pushing it unless some other WWBee stops them and you can't really blaim them for it. CCP messed up the game, not goons.
---
Advertising on reddit seems like the best possible way that you and the 4 other pilots will hold the system ....
---
Fair enough. I just find infrequent planet checking less boring than RR nestor ratting, and isk/attention is about the same.
---
That's the justification that the losers use, sure.
---
Yeah man I've never understood this. I fly cruisers and down since I like fighting small gang or solo, so the larger shit can just fuck off and hang with the bigger alliances. I don't get the attitude of those kinds of people and I really hope Eve doesn't die. It's a great game.
---
Yup. That's what makes you a real pirate. I mean fuckin Rixx Javix is at 66% and isn't he still the king of pirates?
---
Players will get bored and either move on to another alliance (if they still want to Eve) or unsub I suppose.
---
So let's keep in mind that xl guns are also fired from ships larger than some cities. For instance titans are about as large as Manhattan.
---
Don't even know who he is tbh... So maybe?
---
Attack battleships with XL capital guns because I want more big shooties and let FAux's have a squadron of support fighters so they can get into screwing each other while the Blobs go at it lol
---
shameless plug for my post, but a very low skill and cheap punisher for T1 electrical filaments here -&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bznzpd/so_i_started_playing_eve/eqwuux2/ it can pretty safely solo a t1 so three of the might be able to to do t2.
---
hard to lose if you don´t play that game.
---
1. Not suggesting anything. I’m wishing for a fracturing in goons because that’s the only way to combat them
---
2. Change cannot happen in others because goons can squash any opposition when they feel like it
---
3. Goons are following the meta and abusing it (as they should), which is why ultimately change should come from the devs, but honestly the odds of goons breaking up are greater than CCP fixing this
---
Nice . Sounds like it!
---
So your solution to this problem is people getting bored. Got it.
---
That’s not an acceptable conflict driver lmfao
---
"i-i didn't lose i just didn't play the game"
---
Pathetic.
---
Makes since, cause people create isk by selling Plex so I guess it has to go away somehow
---
Was in 4-man w-space corp for nearly 3 years.
---
It really didn't work unless everyone was online.
---
Ah, never heard that one used. Corp mates and I  Just used carebear. I thought for a second that somehow that was offense, to people other than miners.
---
The problem with fixing it is that it will shit on nobody but the smaller entities. What exists, cannot be taken away (without going full asshole-dev) 
---
I would almost swear on goons being unbreakable as an entity due to out of game ties. If everthing falls over, the friends will still stick together.
---
The only option left is for the others to catch up. Hell, if nothing else, they still have their faction citadels.

Eveoganda author, runs Stay Frosty, former CSM, commentates the AT...don't think they've ever won one tho. Never seen them not make top 16. Not as big of a celebrity these days but if you see him in local he's probably trying to kill you.

Oh right the stay frosty guy, yeah I know him. Never came across him but saw he managed to kill a 1bil Loki in a stabber solo... Holy fucking shit, mad respect.

So. I'm trying to do the Produce To Sell thing. I've been setting up spreadsheets, using  Fuzzwork.co.uk/region to import market data. So far, I've got the costs:profits of Basic Hybrid Ammo sorted. At least in a basic capacity.   
---
My main issue now is market research. Does anyone have any tips for streamlining the process of finding items worth selling? As it is, it looks like it'll be a pretty long and tedious process to find which systems have a market for which items and to quote a wizened and aged meme, Ain't Nobody Got Time For That. Less looking for specific system tips, more tips on how to do System Market research myself. Teach a person to fish and they'll have food for life and all that.   
---
Anybody got any tips for a newbie Produce-To-Sell monkey, basically?
---
ah good another brand new clueless, unironic farms and fields mouthbreather talking like they know the game, one step closer to the servers shutting down
---
&gt; All you do is roll the holes and don't warp to them.
---
AFAIK, that no-longer works.  CCP changed that a while back, putting it on a random timer before the wormhole manifests itself.
---
&gt;Only thing that could bring life back in is a massive nerf to titans and supers as it is only one entity that has them anymore that pretty much controls server wide production.
---
Nope , you still have the +1 any other ship then.
---
"Pro-facwar" candidate is fraternizing with hardcore L4 farmers on their discord.  Candidate did not understand why Rorq inflation and L4 mission LP inflation affect facwar differently.  The NanDe coalition has declared missions \_haram\_ and recommends execution of mission-loving facwar "players" on sight.
---
I didn't propose a solution you complete cretin.  I just said what would happen.
---
A triumph of stupidity and instant gratification.
---
Call is salt, or gloat if you want. Truth is, CCP fucked over its veteran players, esp those that drive significant content in this game.
---
My comment has nothing to do with the current status of the war, who is winning or losing, and I won't delve into hair splitting (what mechanic caused what). 
---
CCP undermined any incentive for past and present players to invest in this game (and I am not talking about krabbing and building wealth, that plays a minor role in content creation in EVE, the EVE we loved since 2003/2004). 
---
CCP might think (or tell itself) that the changes made it "easier" for players to play EVE or "experience all the things". EVE turned into a masochistic credit card fueled space mobile game plagued with BOTs.
---
Still love the game though, get fucked CCP.
---
I kinda agree with you      0.0 needs this   it will bring people to the new server
---
Nah, they need to do DPS, or some sort of ewar, and they 'should' get on the kill mail
---
CCP said they would do something about this, still waiting.
---
It has to DPS. You dont get on mail for repping people.
---
People called making isk "jewing" for a while.
---
Many still do, but popular lingo has it called krabbing now.
---
Around 10 would be enough to shatter an earth like planet.. That \*is\* terrifying!

or ewar. Any aggressive action will do.
---
NC. is getting raped out of nullsec
---
The solution to reducing power of one alliance/group will almost certainly help small alliances, that’s the key. If they can be helped without it helping goons, I think that’s the solution. I have 0 idea what it could be, but I think it involves NPC null and lowsec.
---
Goons nowadays are not nearly as close out of game as they used to. They’ve pretty much let in whoever wants to join because ATM the meta is having both pvp and industry people (which is why NCPL have faltered). I think something would have to lure out the casual goons, but ATM goons have so much to offer in terms of industry and security.
---
I don't need your CSM vote because I'm not running.   I just need you to upvote the truth.  Facwar missions are evil and nobody claiming to enjoy lowsex PVP can afford not to take a hard line on gutting L4 mission income and updating the content to something related to the PVP ceremonies.
---
Arty lokis with 1 or 0 webs = yer bloody dead. It's probably why I see so many missile lokis these days.
---
... yeah... I know...
---
Essentially. Basically, the opportunity cost of deploying is higher than any actual damage goons have taken since wwb
---
We didn't plan on holding it or use the system. We wanted to drop it to learn how sov mechanics work and to be on the map for once and "immortalize" ourselves this way and that's it. We just wait until someone destroys it and enjoy it as long as it's there. Estimated life time was about 3-4 days anyways.
---
Tnt is still allive and getting kills
---
I don't even doubt that. Although other numbers are weird, the fact that they top the ranking while being on Tranq for only one year cannot be ignored.

I would just stop trying to reason with these guys man. As a reformed TAPI brain it’s kinda crazy how much they foam at the mouth to spout rhetoric.
---
Yeah passive fit it for Regen. There's a few YouTube videos of that.
---
I think in C3s people often use passive regen and change the lows for more DPS as they kill rats (launch a mobile depot for that).
---
I like how you used the Tzar Bomba, the largest nuclear bomb ever detonated. However, this is actually not a good example. You see, the bomb that was tested was less than 1/2 as powerful as the actual deployed version (50Mgt vs 100+Mgt). This is because at the last minute the head designer chose to play it safe and replaced the uranium tamper with a lead tamper. This resulted in the bomb losing over half of its destructive power, but also resulted in it being one of the "cleanest" nuclear weapons ever detonated. Now why this matters is because depending on what numbers you used, you may have omitted a very large portion of the nuclear material. I would say that 30% fuel to mass ratio might be closer to 50% or 60%.
---
The other factor to consider is that in space you want to min/max different factors than you do on earth. When detonating a nuke in the atmosphere, you generally want to maximize the thermal energy, thus generating the greatest overpressure and shock wave. But since space has no medium to transfer kinetic energy, what you really want is to maximize the photon energy released in the x-ray spectrum. This is where most of the initial energy from a nuclear explosion is anyways, and it is actually the massive x-ray flux released from a fission reaction that is used to compress the fussion core of all thermonuclear weapons.  
---
One way to maximize the x-ray emission is to wrap the weapon in a material that will emit x-rays when bombarded by neutrons released from the initial reaction. Normally these high energy neutrons will radiate the uranium 238 tamper causing further fission reactions. But since the energy created from extra fission is just wasted out in space, you want to replace the uranium with an x-ray generatot. Gold is perfect for this. There was even a warhead, the W71, that was designed as a anti-ballistic missile weapon that had a gold tamper instead of a uranium one so as to maximize the production of x-rays over total yield. It was able to destroy incoming warheads tens of kilometers away just through the massive energy flux it created. So maybe using the Tzar Bomba was actually a fluke that worked in your favor. 
---
Not sure how this affects your calculations. Just wanted to make it even less clear.
---
You would because it’s close to the mining and other activities needed for production and don’t want to jump your inputs all the way the fuck back to god knows where.   
---
If I were in a Panfam Corp close to that facility I’d look at it for use.  Why not?
---
There were mines?
---
have you looked at the jump ranges of tribute, and where pl and nc actually mine?
---
no?
---
okay lmao bye
---
I fail to think anything that would help the small guys and not buff the big guys in the process.
---
As for the security and industry, the only way to dent that is to make an offer that sounds better than living in Delve.
---
the implication is that tnt is a walking corpse that has never lived on its own and never will
---
Actually, you can, I had it happen to me back in 2010.  Although the circumstances were weird.
---
I was in a boot fleet in Molea kicking down the EVE Cemetery tower, and boot fleet so we're spider repping.  DaiTengu pulled Concord aggro somehow and I'm repping him so it spreads to me.  Killmail goes to DaiTengu, my loss mail shows him as KB despite doing zero damage.
---
It isn't the upkeep that's an issue.  It's the index.
---
We tend to avoid stepping on each others toes, by moving between structures that have a high index, and co-ordinating job submissions when index is low.
---
If you can't do that, you may want to be on your own.
---
This is how I imagine Jay in Delve when krabbing:

I ran something very similar, although a bit blingier.  I'd consider swapping one of the cap rechargers for a Thukker or RF large cap battery, and look to see if a second BCS vs the third DDA in the lows gives you better DPS. I ran with a Gecko instead of sentries since it applies better to frigates and gives a healthy DPS boost, but that's a matter of taste and cost. I also blinged the shield booster, but this should work fine for now.  Mobile Depot in the cargo, and you can consider swapping an MJD for the painter depending on your paranoia/risk aversion.  Handled all C3 sites without issue - even where the incoming DPS was higher than the tank, you burn down the sleepers fast enough that it doesn't matter (again this was with a Pith X-Type booster, so your mileage might vary).
---
Still (mostly) enjoy the game, too but if I find another one that feels like the CCP days when they were still close to their Ultima roots, I'll jump ship and start fresh.
---
Long time no see Wayne! Hope you're doing good buddy! beautiful idea along with the in depth write up. +1 Where are you guys now? I miss everyone so PM me your ts or discord.

I like this empire building. CCP should implement attainable wonders that one could build. That give a certain bonus to a region
---
Radiator efficiency is dependent on the temperature involved. This is because the hotter it is, the more energetic the photons, and the greater the amount of radiation that occurs. Typical amounts of radiation equate to between 100-300W/m^2 depending on things like surface area (most radiators are not flat to increase surface area per m^2 of radiator), and radiating materials.
---
The issue with what you propose is that the radiators have the heat provided them via heat pipes, and so the aim is to keep the radiator temperature similar to the goal temperature of the station/craft.
---
I don't know that it's impossible, but I have not heard of anybody doing it, which makes me think that the trade-offs have not been worth it for practical use.

Umm .. it was most Skill Urself sov

Needs more Shiny. Upgrade 2 Cap Control rigs to T2, replace 3rd with Anti-EM Screen Reinforcer. Pith X-type X-large Shield Booster and 2 Dread Guristas Shield Boost Amplifier (replace the Target Painter). Faction DDAs if you can afford them.
---
Replace Cap Rechargers with Republic Fleet Large Cap Batteries.
---
This comes out to a solid fit, but it's greatly improved if you can replace the Adaptive Invuln IIs with Pithum C-types and then replace the second Dread Guristas Shield Boost Amp with a Sentient Omnidirectional Tracking Link (Tracking Speed Script).
---

I jest, but the Rattlesnake really does shine when bling-fit.

No, isk isn't created when you sell Plex, you sell Plex to other players.

ISK is created mostly through NPC bounties and mission rewards, as well as certain market orders from NPCs for certain loot types.

---
I'd use liquid nitrogen, but at the same time radiators dont work in space so you'd have to vent some gas through the radiators to pull the heat out.  Which means you'd have to have air/gas stored that you could vent into space through your cooling mechanism.   Venting into your ship would cook you.
---
Thank you for this thoughtful contribution. I will take it into consideration the next time i state my opinion on matters of eve politics.

In 2013, when Brave Newbies were less than a month old and still in Hek, we went to bash a pos in Enden. Kitchen sink fleet, with 2 BS and tons of smaller stuff with 15-20 noob ships included.

1. You have to actually go into the hole to see where it leads, though if you're on-grid with it you can [find out what kind of space](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Visual_wormhole_identification) it leads to.
---
2. When you enter the wormhole, drop a bookmark on it. I like to keep a folder named "today's wormholes" for these bookmarks. Name the bookmark "exit" or something, so you can find your way back to where you came from.
---
Not unpopular, just utterly moronic.

---
Also, Triglavians use "artificial space-time singularities", which is black holes, to power their gates. Those things are the size of a small frigate. I can't log in to check, but let's be generous and assume half the overall radius of a merlin.
---
Merlin sig is 39 meters, so half of that. 19.5, rounded up to 20 because it will not fucking matter. A 20-meter schwarzschild radius on a black hole would mean about 2256 times the mass of earth.
---
One of these black holes, left to its own devices would take about 6.5x10^60 _years_ to dissipate. 
---
If we assume they used energy to generate one of those, due to mass-energy equivalence, it would take 2.8933e29 megatons of TNT for a _single_ one of those, or 100.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 the energy given off by a tsar bomba.

Triglavians are fucking nuts and they need to be stopped.

Delve seems to hover around ~1.5T when not deployed, so it's an uptick, but nothing scary.

This may sound excessive, but you will recoup the investment in no time, better fits make more isk.

Seems to still work. I doubt it's a coincidence.
---
Then the only viable ratting ship will be a supercarrier or a titan under a super umbrella. They both have enough buffer that you can get faxes on grid before anything happens and all subs will die to every roaming gang if they attempt to krab.
---
Sure, would be cool to see that happen, but I'm not sure if it's what the game needs right now.

if you are efficient and have an alt for scanning/bookmarking and tackling drifter you can manage 2 sites an hour, so around 1.2b/hr in a C5 vanilla
---
Sounds about right.  
---
Hybrid weapons routinely sling around Antimatter and even if you assume the thing is mostly containment and reaction mass it's still basically a tiny fusion reaction happening on top if someone's shields, armor, or hull and most ships just kind of shrug.  
---
Even accounting for the fact that blasts don't really propagate well in space and therefore deal a lot less damage you're still dealing with some absolutely massive firepower.  
---
Oh and lets not forget that the ships resisting this stuff basically violate the basic limits of physics just sitting still and without an active warp drive.

It was explained to me when I first started that a Dread's guns were frigate sized. For the autos, they were firing heavy drones at people. Missile launchers _lobbed frigates at people._

But radiators actually use convection to dissipate heat not radiation.  Convection does not work in a vaccum.
---
🤷🏻‍♂️ I’m kingtut not king krab as I said solo running in a dread prob like 350 an hour. If you multibox more you’ll make a lot more
---
More than 1.4k Titans for imperium i think
---
This is what happens when people don't undock.
---
Also a note from what I have noticed, in a passive fit it seems much harder to be ganked by a small group since they have to hit a damage threshold, they can't just neut you out. But yeah, in WH space if you are being targeted for a gank, DPS usually is not the gankers issue, especially when they can just bring more people.
---
You got called out by someone who knows the culture so you claim it was just a troll, cute. I would believe it if you were capable of listening to the simplest of rules instead of being the spod eating idiot you actually are.
---
You left right after you died in embarrassment, you never felt "unwelcome" you wanted to hide your shame and are trying to convince yourself otherwise, we were going to meme you about it, just like the rest of eve did. However if you were anything like samfox and put in effort in repaying your loss it would have been gucci. You put yourself into the position you are in, you are the only one who created this narrative you keep painting to everyone. The legion of idiots in theta might give half a shit but anyone with half a brain knows it's a lie. You alienated yourself, not the other way around.
---
What?
---
Ranger regiment and Frat "are chinese"?
---
Yes, but no.  Things in space overheat quickly.  At least near as we are to the sun.  The ISS and NASA's hardest issue with much of human spaceflight is dealing with overheating.

&gt; A massive nerf to super and titans would cripple any smaller alliance who wants to use them. There is no way to undo the damage that is already done.
---
Bring back Apocrypha with all of us in day one pilots. Problem solved. :)
---
Two dreads with good sp and skill is like 3b an hour tops in a c5. Including scanning and rolling warping etc, like 2b per hour

Goons already got revenge on Horde, they gave you Gobbins to live with.

He keeps talking about logging in but we have yet to see him do it.. Avery is doing his best job at making up for him though.

Forget drones/fighters, just deploy these bad boys.
---
oh no, its in my head again
---
Jump into a meatgrinder or go to where there is content.. decisions...
---
You can't just go "Radiators don't work in space" and then say "oh, it's just my thoughts".  You can't defend making genuinely incorrect, and easily disprovable statements and hand wave it away as opinion.
---
This is actually quite interesting. I was wondering what the numbers were like myself as well. Though I think the supercarrier numbers are probably off as most people with titans will also probably have at least one.
---
Also I was wondering in the case of a single pilot having more than one titan, such as an Avatar and an Erebus, does it count as two titans on your graph or just a single as it's one pilot?
---
The timing would have been a huge coincidence.
---
So you're telling me that Khan wasn't as smart as he thought?
---
I don't know much about dread ratting since the changes, but just from watching people in sites, there's a *massive* difference between single dread and dual dread.
---
If you go that route, use two dreads.
---
Thonking.
---
I think maybe around 500-600mil an hr. If in a naglfar with drop the sites only take about 25min and drifter like 10.
---
If you’re in a hole you know. Scanning and rolling the statics is like 15minish. I swear I can do it in ten sometimes.
---
I don’t believe Ranger Regiment will be able to hold all that sov once goonies go home. They don’t have the numbers
---
Would be nice to change ship  priority mid fight
---
Welps that's it for the game then ... the krabs have determined that the opportunity cost of deploying to have a fun war is higher than the value generated by staying home and krabbing. 
---
War is off, all future wars are off. PVE only now guys.
---
Once Goons wins, they need a way to cement their hold on the blue doughnut. Good thing they have the CSM in their pocket, good chance something like this can be implemented.

Radiators on earth are not radiators.  It's not the same at all.  If we approximate anything heated in comparison to a black body, we can see that they do give off energy, heat, whatever you want to call it, in a vacuum.
---
A radiator on earth uses convection.  A radiator in space emits electromagnetic radiation.
---
Exceedingly slowly by comparison.
---
Darn it,this is not a bittervet thing, this is an Eve-player vs random fps player thing!
---
Tbh cant be arsed anymore with eve it's just become  ridiculous alliances owning regions and hundreds of  systems..
---
how much does triple boxing T5s make?
---
I spent way to much time reading every comment and theory in this thread. 10/10 would do it again.
---
Same. Personally, I'm not sure what my price is, but it is probably north of 4 trillion isk, at least. That's what I could grab right now with no effort on my part. The alliance doesn't trust me all that much, but it's a nice sum I guess.
---
NC is trying to play the victim, someones gotta keep the narrative straight
---
Woah munnins against kikis totally fair fight 🙃
---
It gets even worse when you realize that a 3500mm shell with a volume of .12m3 is only 11cm tall. We're basically shooting disks at each other.
---
If this is not already a song you are now obligated to produce it.
---
Which is one of the advantages in space buddy, you can build shit real big.  More surface area means you can radiate more.
---
Or is the ISS, various satellites, and multiple other space craft fucking magic?
---
To my knowledge, there hasn't been a super fight big enough yet to test it out. The last one I can think of that might have been big enough was the keppie fight where Test dropped 500+ dreads on the PL/NC/Holy superblob.
---
There hasn't been a large enough titan/super fight yet for changes in the meta to manifest.
---
If any bloc FCs have theorycrafted how to optimally deploy dreads with the new changes, none of them will show their until they think it's worth doing so.
---
Why do you care this much?
---
I made an assumption that the radiators needed to dissipate in space acted similar to the ones I am familiar with here on Earth.  I assumed that the heat generated and absorbed by the ISS and satellites was minimal compared to that of giant guns on theoretical spaceships.
---
And sorry, I should not have said "just my thoughts", I should have said "just my understanding."
---
Underrated comment.
---
Not unless NCdock undocked and contests for their structure.
---
Lol 3T? We bring in about \~30T per month in just ratting and mining. Our lost opportunity cost should be closer to \~29T this month because we are fully deployed and afk glassing Panfam. But of course, worthless krabs are gunna crab. So please, keep killing them so they either leave our wonderful Imperium -PBUH- or wake up and come up north to join in the art of glassblowing. :P  
---
Also what the MEP doesn't show is the real value of the citadel rigs that Panfam has pulled on 90% of their structures. A lot of them were T2 and early build during the Casino War which adds about another \~1T to the loss value of Tribute. Oh and we've already started glassing much of Vale (including several keeps and sots). Ohhhh, and I totally already forgot about the glassed region of Tenal by Dead Co (lol).  
---
Also, what is the loss value of Germinate? I'm having a hard time dropping on all your Roqs when they are docked 23/7. :p
---
People have been doing that for a long, long time.
---
I used to make ISK station trading in Jita.  Use an alt in an NPC corp to avoid wardecs and you can scale up alot.  It gives you an income source so you can persue the rest of the game as you want to without the need to join a big corp if you dont want to.
---
Easily, given that a single doomsday can do that.  I can't find the lore article at the moment, but a terrorist group fired one off at a planet once and basically killed everything on the planet.  The planet in question is now "Barren".
---
Honestly the average supercap battle would probably turn a planet in to a molten blob, if not blast off the crust and do significant damage to the structure of the planet.
---
&gt;the krabs have determined that the opportunity cost of deploying to have a fun war is higher than the value generated by staying home and krabbing.
---
You forgot the part where every month like clockwork, the usual suspects come in to threads like these to jerk themselves off to those big numbers they've gotten.
---
Now that those numbers are falling, I guess that doesn't matter anymore lma0
---
I just find PI so much worse than krabbing for 4 hours to get Plex plus ships
---
That doesn't account for pulled rigs, or several other factors either.
---
Because the biggest purpose of titan's DD is to delete Dreadnoughts
---
This is freaking awesome! nice job!
---
But look like people.
---
It is a bit ironic that the East in Eve was almost always predominantly Russian, and is now predominantly Chinese
---
&gt;It will nerf bigger alliances and force them to spread out, making krabbing more risky since umbrella will be slower. 
---
I don't think you quite understand just how big the umbrellas are now.
---
Goons could easily have Theta cover 3 regions, via 3 standing fleets.  All one jump away from anything that gets tackled.  TEST could easily cover two.  NCPL could also cover multiple regions if they undocked.
---
Temporary anchorable guns , lets have it
---
&gt; Like how people would hunt you down and blast the ever living crap out of you for luls with big ass ships.
---
I mean... yeah. But also everywhere in Eve.
---
I guess after playing for 15 years. The amount of times I have heard X Y Z is unbeatable role the credit , ya know.  These sweet summer children.
---
Holy shit I feel attacked by this meme....
---
"Damn I need isk. i'll just VNi rat until I can carrier rat.
---
Ok I'll just carrier rat until I can buy super and make even more isk/hour (before the nerf)
---
Oh man I should make a second account and make a Fax alt, so I'll rat for second Omega account and injectors to speed up the process.
---
I should really make two characters on that account another account for scouting and cynoing if the need arises.
---
Oh man, I can't just have these alta sitting there doing nothing, I should train them into some passive ISK stuff like PI. 
---
Oh new doctrines, I should skill inject into these asap on my main. Gotta rat a little more...
---
Hasn't that always been the case?
---
That's not true.
---
Repping will not put you on a killmail. You will inherit the timers of any one you rep, but it doesn't count toward a killmail.
---
You *have* to have some commit some offensive action against the ship that dies. It can be a target painter, or drones, or a single shot that missed. Repping alone will not put you on a killmail.
---
&gt; Holy superblob. 
---
I'll never be able to unsee that
---
I read in a reddit comment (so take this with a grain of salt) that the test titan that jumped instead of bridging recently did have faxes dropped on it. Supposedly a hundred dreads can out damage a hundred faxes.
---
That was just one titan though. I'd imagine if there were 50 titans, it might turn out differently
---
Fax reps have stacking penalties now. Dread damage doesn't.
---
You mean the time Goonswarm owned the entire other half of the map? And that it was so cancer that CCP basically had to rework nullsec to make spheres of influence less potent? Yeah, that was a pretty shit time for the game.
---
Thought y'all would have learned your lesson and that blue doughnuts are shit for the game regardless of who it is, but I guess dinobrains are only capable of processing 'grrrr ncpl'

Could a blinged out T1 frigate potentially win against a pirate frigate in a 1v1 FW in a novice plex. I'm talking about beating a pirate frigate at their own game (ie: not kiting a brawler and winning because the brawler just can't really hit you at range).
---
I asked you “how is there any way people can compete” and you answered “people will get bored”. That was your solution.
---
That’s why this is so difficult and why I think goons would break up before CCP finds a way to balance this.
---
There’s no way to make a better offer because goons can simply swing their dick and make that space less safe.
---
I asked Google this question a while back and found an Reddit thread explaining how the Russian word for grinding/PVEing sounded a lot like "Crab" (I think it was "Krebbit" or something). The term caught on certain wormhole groups (I think HK?) and "crabbing" spread from there.
---
Source: Someone on Reddit that Google pointed me to many, many, many eons ago.
---
Wait, so the expectation was that a huge alliance would deploy and somehow still keep krabbing the same amount as before? Of course the numbers dropped... I would expect they would go right back up after the deployment. 
---
... now if they \*don't\* go back up after the deployment, that would be interesting. Might mean the Goonies lose members when they are not just sitting at home being fat and happy.
---
this has got to be the most spodbrained post i’ve ever seen on this sub
---
Just not letting goons be the sole owner of super safe space would be enough to steer people to other alliances. Many want to get into null to krab, but would like to avoid goons.
---
Goons started out as one of those small entities in Syndicate getting their shit pushed in by BoB. The difference was perseverance and a willingness to lose and keep going. We are the original newbie Corp. Brave and PH are copies of us in the beginning.
---
I go with FedNavy or ImpNavy DDAs, but if Dread Guristas is cheaper and provides the same benefit go for it. 
---
Personally, I use Cruise Missile Launchers, but I can definitely see the value in using RHMLs; too often I'm unleashing volleys on stuff that's moving too fast and has a sig radius too small. I don't know whether RHMLs are better overall because of that or not, but they very well could be.
---
Yes, but at least back in the day those systems had people in it because you couldn't pack them all into one tiny area. Oh, and those people actually were people and not bots. Oh, and those people often reshipped and tried to fight you.
---
I bet you nerd's have the coolest pocket protectors.
---
He is from NC?
---
Goons started as a small entity? Are you mad? Goons’ early tactics literally involved swarming their enemies with masses people in essentially kitchen sink ships and would win based on pure numbers.
---
That and getting buddy buddy with red alliance and i think tau ceti? Whatever the french “federation” was

Five minutes later.
---
That's pretty nice, but it's not brain surgery.
---
Maybe if you made good posts you wouldn't get downvoted :smart:
---
Honest question, excuse my layman's phrasing.
---
How did you calculate the yield? 100% efficiency of fission/fusion fuel to energy conversion? Or did you use the Tsarbomb's efficiency ratio? 
---
The former would be plain wrong as nuclear devices only use a fraction of their fuel for the actual reaction. Most of it is dissipated.
---
Using Tsarbomb's efficiency ratio would be more valid. However, the Tsar was very much thrown together in a very short time as a demonstration. As a planetary weapon it was useless. Uneconomic. See MIRV.
---
Regarding New Eden's capsuleer warfare, gigaton warheads may make sense. But regarding New Edens technological level I'd say that The Tsar was just an ancient prototype and the actual yield to mass ratio would be significantly higher.
---
Not trolling, but, if we're doing brainfuckery, might as well do it right.
---
Because I majored in Aerospace engineering, and minored in Nuclear engineering.  Science matters.  Facts matter.

Reassuring statements: "Well, the *good* news is that the atmosphere will mostly be blown into space, so..."
---
If you are flying a fax and worried about kill mails, just use a dread
---
You're asking two different questions here.
---
For C3, you can make a cheap passive recharge RHML fit. This is a cheap active fit which I guess is about a similar level of effectiveness
---
For C4 solo you need cruise missiles (because the sleepers spawn miles away) and you need blingy active tank (because the sites do 1300 DPS). The payout isn't much better so it probably isn't worth it.
---
lmao
---
It's more so that there isn't a lot to push that energy in a damaging way to the ship imo. On planets we have atmosphere that attribute to a lot of the damage of bombs.  IIRC nukes won't do too much in space
---
Its not noob friendly.
---

---
Or just a post made of common practical economic fucking sense - how in the absolute shit does your brain work so erroneously thay you disagree with my statement of “*Delve’s consistent 11 trillion isk ore output dropping to &lt; 1 trillion isk ore output will cause ore pricing to increase thus resulting in higher initial revenues when we get back to mining*” ???
---
Last fireside mittens boasted about having just over 1k titans deployed in kqk.
---
There may be another 300-500 back in delve, but they aren't combat fit/capable.
---
As much as I'd like to come upon you and kill this, it's way to blingy.  These other dudes are trolling you.  The C-type Adaptives are completely unnecessary and add about 1B to your total fit.  Just go with regulars.  Same for the drone damage amps - T2s are fine.  The only things I'd really suggest blinging are the shield booster and the cap battery.  Everything else will be just fine T2.
---
Yes FAX are a smartbomb platform, and should be used as such.
---
Titans deleting dreads with DDs don't either.
---
The iss has 14 6' by 10' radiators that just manage to pull the heat from a small orbital station where most of the heat on board comes from the humans, then avionics and scientific instruments.  It does work, just well enough for the things we are doing in space right now.  It will not be sufficient to deal with the kind of heat "giant space guns" will make even if your craft were absolutely bristling with radiators.  Not without some way to accelerate the process and prevent damage to the fragile wing like structures temselves.
---
In real space combat, you would certainly try to. Wars would be won by cooking the other ship until the people / computers inside can't function.
---
Daddy's back and he's not fucking happy

---
It's a tactical advance to the rear OK.
---
Do you know id they are also unanchoring the NPC gates? Looking for 2
---
Literally not too blingy, you do not know what you're talking about. I regularly take a fit similar to this out. I keep my alt on a hole to hear gate flashes. If you're risk averse, that's your problem, not mine
---
yes, everyday.
---
1. Ore prices will not change enough for you to cover deployment costs. Delve obviously has a huge effect on the market, but the drop in ore production is nowhere near what is needed to increase ore prices enough for you to cover deployment costs
---
2. Markets will adjust as you are selling the new ore into the market. Because in eve you have perfect information, an increase in supply will almost immediately cause a decrease in price. Some people will certainly make profit, but again it will be nowhere near enough to cover deployment costs.
---
Idk man, sounds like the same stuff I've heard before. "nobody's in space because 1 power can control half the map!" "Russians are filling EVE with bots to RMT!" etc. The alliances have always been pretty ridiculous and there have been megablocs since like, 2008. 
---
But you're not wrong, game is still way more shit now.
---
Look, we just don't have the numbers, OK? Our bois couldn't adapt so we got mad and stopped playing. Leave us alone!
---
Sentry drones: am I a joke to you?
---
Late to this party, but the yield is likely *much* larger than this. That 6 kt/kg limit is dependent on both the size of the weapon and that the weapon is all fission based. 
---
Using multiple small fission devices inside to warhead to cascade detonate a fusion secondary, tertiary, etc, until you run out of space, can increase yields to crazy levels. 
---
US scientists came up with plans for devices that greatly exceeded the 6 kt/kg setting. None have yet been made, because there is no reason for a weapon of that size to exist, as it would be too unwieldy to use. 
---
Additionally, you dismiss antimatter as a fuel for the weapon, but Anti-matter doesn't need to make up much of the bomb, it could be used as the primary device to set off the dozen or so other fission and fusion stages.
---
With elite skilz like that he should be flying a VNI.
---
This isn't a bad idea either.
---
I'm happy for you.  I'm sure you do take this fit out, and it will work perfectly.  But it's not a starter setup like the OP asked for.  Again, I'd love to kill this fit and loot the shit out of it, but I'd rather encourage a newbro into J space and give him success so he stays rather than discourage him because he credit card warriored a fit he then lost and couldn't replace. You do you, but your advice in this context is bad.

Detailed explanations by  [**u/lasiusflex**](https://www.reddit.com/user/lasiusflex/)
---
Ah. No wonder i couldnt source all the downvotes i needed... You fucking took em.
---
In this age of EvE you just need a PayPal or WeChat account.
---
I understand where you're coming from, this subreddit and the EVE forum did cry those things. However as someone who has done small gang roaming over all of the null regions via WH's for years (minus a gap from '16 - '19), this is the worst I have ever seen the game.
---
Even though back in the day null was owned by mostly 4-5 groups, their coalitions were spread out and had some pretty laughable groups trying to be good in nullsec that would fight. It just isn't the case anymore. I'd say about 75% or the regions I have roamed are just mindless VNI Netflix Bingers, or bots, and they don't bother to fight because why should they? They know a roamer is just going to leave.
---
People have been doom and gloom about this game since the beginning. But as someone with a relatively fresh perspective coming back, I am shocked at how bad it is.
---
OP is suffering from more delay than Internet Explorer.
---
Well, there’s that.
---
Yes I'll grant you credit that it's not a starter setup and that's my bad for not reading closely enough. I was focused on "I've heard about the Rattlesnake's legendary PvE abilities" and figured, maybe he's just bad at fitting so I should show him why it's so legendary.
---
But yes certainly it is not a starter setup and I'm at fault for not mentioning that outright.
---
&gt;That has to go to whatever the fuck the Erebus uses to generate a million-tonne ball of fucking antimatter.
---
Oh, no worries, they just figured out how to manipulate magnetic fields (thanks, sleepers!) in such a way to basically take antimatter out of space and turn it in to a fuck-you railgun.
---
No biggie.
---
The stacking penalty would be the same
---
Another Eve is dying thread. But Eve *is* hurting because the direction the game's being taken means any playstyle apart from nullblobbing is made less and less fun, and the people that enjoy those other styles play less or leave. (SkillU packing it in should surely be a huge wake-up call for everyone, for example, but many small group PVP players will have given up before them.) And even for nullblobbers, when one blob wins (which Goonperium is in danger of doing), it will stop being fun for either side.
---
It needs to be a game that nullblobbers can find fun. But it also needs to be a game that roamers, small corp players, groups of friends doing some casual PVE, pirates, mission runners etc can find fun. The game can go a huge distance away from umbrella-secured near-AFK ISK generation and still be fun for nullblobbers - hell, if mining or ratting was riskier and people got caught more often, there'd be more for standing fleets to do; roaming content is good for everyone.
---
The 'absurd PLEX prices' as someone put it up thread don't help, but they're a symptom of the absurd levels of ISK generation in nullblobs, and CCP's unwillingness to look at skill farming and injectors because of the short term boost they give the bottom line.
---
&gt; If this is the future of roaming I think EVE is going to have some serious problems soon
---
Tbh I think Eve is already having serious problems in that regard. It is not yet unsavable, but it's getting pretty bad.

This guy uses blasters.

That's what I thought, was surprised to not see you guys on the list here.

I think that's the Jaguar.

The best way to play Eve is the way you consider the most fun. For me it's CAFFEINE + BLASTERS + HULL TANK LET'S GOOOOOOOOO
---
Yep, I quit in '14 and have basically just been watching the dumpster fire from a safe distance with my popcorn. At this point it's just reached full on Orwellian territory though, complete with attempts to completely rewrite history or ignore hard facts.
---
I didn't think it could actually ever get worse than when it was N3PL owning half of the entire map on one side, and the CFC owning half the map on the other, but by some miracle that nobody asked for, it was managed.
---
Its the yoghurt guy!

&gt; you would have to wait 54 days to get a max frack.

I think their is a disconnect in play styles. You are playing to protect your players as I play to kill them. We lack the experience of being on the other side. It's not about easy dunks, just a balance issue. The amount of effort to go thru the numerous layers of preventive measures defenders have implemented overwhelming. To successfully tackle a player means they weren't utilizing the tools given to them. The way the game is now, There is little to no risk as he can light a cyno and reinforce the field. Now I make it sound easy but from my point of view, it looks that way. That most likely not the case, this is where the disconnect for both sides are coming from. This is also why I'm happy you commented, it shines light on different points of views. I would like to find a happy median between the two play styles.

---
If the rigs aren't on the killmail, how do you know they ever existed?
---
Poor Goons, dealing with all the prejudice.
---
Let's assume that all the ratting and mining in Cloud Ring, Delve, Fountain, and Querious was done by Imperium members. It's not, so actual numbers will be lower, but this will be fun anyway.
---
In April, you had roughly 12.5t in ratting, and 14t in mining.
---
In March, you had roughly 15.2t in ratting, and 17.6t in mining
---
In February, you had roughly  17.6t in ratting, and 16.1t in mining.
---
This should give you some background on normal numbers for the imperium. Here are the numbers for May, separated by region
---
Delve: 4.9t mining, 5t ratting
---
Fountain: 1.1t mining, 2.2t ratting
---
Cloud Ring: 187b mining, 179b ratting
---
Querious: 1.6t mining, 1.5t ratting
---
 Here are the relative changes in those numbers from April to May:
---
Delve: -4.9t mining, -2.9t ratting
---
Fountain: -215b mining, -988b ratting
---
Cloud Ring: -65b mining, -18b ratting
---
Querious: -1.1t mining, -578b ratting.
---
So the two main Imperium regions (Delve and Fountain) collectively lost roughly 5.1 trillion isk worth of mining and 3.9 trillion in ratting bounties.
---
If we pretend that every loss in Tribute, Vale, Geminate, and Tenal was a panfam loss, we find about 2.14t isk in losses. Panfam has been active in Etherium Reach, and rents out Kalevala, Malpais, and the Spire. Adding in all those regions, we get a total loss number of roughly 3.35t. By adding in the 1T of pulled rigs, we can finally get it up to 4.35t, slightly more than the opportunity cost of 3.9t in lost ratting income.
---
Note: I fully expect this to change when the June MER comes around, as most of the structures have been killed in June.
---
TL;DR: This will change for June, but in May, the lost ratting income in Delve and Fountain combined is roughly 3.9t. To eclipse that number, we have to include all losses in every slightly panfam-controlled area, and add in the estimated 1T isk in pulled rigs.
---
Call the gsm if you need help
---
I can fly those!
---
Agree. Moved so much stuff there :')
---
So skillu dropped all their sov and your growing bad guy's plan there massively failed as the bloc's around well Skillu picked up the Sov.

Why do you think it's gonna play out different when PL drops it all ?
---
History repeating itself
---
I had a spy once in a horde city raid group and knew they were coming to Ironforge. I spammed chat and organized the best defense group I could muster to wait for them. The battle took like an hour and was actually super epic.
---
We all have our jobs to do, and sgt.maj. sixtas job is to be an asshole... and he excels at the position.

---
damn dude, i like you, but look at the MER, you're completely off with your numbers lol
---
Tears are not cheap but definitely worth it
---
You roll with the same dread you do sites in dawg.
---
So all you need to do is reship or bring more dreads than Titans
---
What's ADM?
---
The loss in ratting income from April to May in Delve/Fountain was about 3.9t. If we assume that an extra 2 weeks of deployment would cause another 1.1t in losses (reasonable imo) then the imperium costs themselves roughly 5t per month on deployment, even ignoring mining figures. If they've averaged 4.13t in losses/month over the last 3 months, they've done more damage to themselves than anyone has done to them, *even if we ignore everything related to mining.*
---
Not that kind of prejudice, you ape. The prejudice against miners.

thanks &lt;3

How's mining broken, srs question

Took a break from eve for a few years, and I'm glad I missed that.

I think it depends on the ship as much as how much bling you're willing to wager. For example, you're still going to have a pretty tough time brawling a Daredevil at point blank in a blingy Incursus because the Daredevil's damage is just bananas. But you could probably kill something like a Dramiel in a blingy Slasher if you're also a good pilot. Good luck killing a Garmur ever, they can just disengage too easily.
---
Killed a titan earlier with a 80B pod...but he pulled all the implants before the killmail so it only showed as 10K. Trust me though....dude lost a 80B pod!
---
/s incase it wasn't obvious.
---
depends on what faction Amarr has like2  left all others a bit more choices
---
I've been avoiding TiDi fights lately but anyone willing to fight 8 fleets of 50 dreads would probably bring in a couple fleets of 50 titans. And iirc, titan doomsdays aren't affected by TiDi so in the time it takes the dread blob to cycle its guns and kill a titan, 50 doomsdays have gone off, killed 50 dreads and are almost ready for the next firing round.
---
Lol first of all, I listened to the whole thing on break with a spodbrain smile on my face so thank you for this, you did good
---
Secondly, you should re-record it except listen to the instrumental in your headphones while you do it so your timing isnt so fucking incredibly off lmao - this particular shit post would actually benefit from some tryhard
---
You just booted your own goal post half way down the field. 
---
You said “everything” would get more expensive. Now it’s supers?
---
The other comment is entirely correct. The actual mineral cost isn’t what makes ships cost what they do. Pirate ship costs come from the blueprint. T2 ships come from all the other shit they need to produce + invention, not the minerals.
---
The place you see mineral prices actually affecting things is in caps. And would less caps really be a bad thing right about now?
---
If anybody is an idiot in this chain of comments that would be you.

They are affected by tidi, but they are reliable in tidi unlike guns.

Is there any outside of game resource that list the current active Invasion systems and their classification?
---
Nope. 1kg.
---
As someone who has access to the actual api numbers these discussions always amuse me greatly.
---
Thanks for the correction, cheers
---
You could bring 10 times as many dreads than titans and still lose lol.
---
you need a titan at both ends of route to do it properly.
---
Also the appropriate exclamation when your lone hunting T3 gets dropped on the second it lands on a rorqual grid in delve while GSF is home
---
I see sarcasm is completely lost on you. You replied to a Frat dude btw.
---
If the planet has a magnetic field and the battle happens outside of that, it would more than likely be fine. However, i am no scientist so i could very well be completely wrong in this case.
---
why does he look like mittani in the first picture
---
...no, literally, a Chinese player sued ccp when he was banned for botting and won, so they just allow botting on the Chinese server (which is separate from the rest of EvE) and so now everyone on the Chinese server Serenity bots
---
&gt; That's not true.

Thanks for that lol. It wasn't as off in Audacity, I think when I merged the tracks and created the MP3 it messed it up a little. I have never used it before. I am planning on trying for a version 2.0 with some kind of autotune-ish plugin if I can find a free one.
---
Flair doesn't check out.  I was looking for goons.
---
Last time the titan blob made the game stale they upped the dreadnaught damage (2013), it led to dread bombs and fantastic fights, they should do the same now.
---
&gt;implying the CSM has that much power  
---
Friend, i got a bridge for sale.

for the cost of 1 titan you can field 50+ dreads

I’ve been playing Eve for 12 years now on 3 accounts, never injected a thing.

Was an accomplishment to get into my first dread and carrier.

Years of planning and patience. Not too pleased with this, inject-a-titan on week 2 crap.

It literally shows on the killmail what the aggression was from. It was a bouncer. He must have accidentally hit F on that ship while trying to switch targets. It happens all the time. The 0 damage just means that the bouncer missed.

so for the purposes of this discussion are we pretending horde is in control etherium reach ? Because if they are its weird how NC decided who would live there and then helped clear out the space.

Hirr today, also posting today.

Hell yeah man, go all in! And the mismatch adds a lot of charm too, idk, maybe I'm wrong and it actually benefits from the jank. 
---
Either way, love the idea and appreciate the effort you put in to making us smile.
---
As the game draws to a close you will see more entities join the winning side, just to say they were on the side that won eve. It begun awhile ago, and now that the cards have been shown it will accelerate. A fracture in goons is pretty much all that will change this inevitable ending. I'll be sad when we reach the serenity, but I'll also be happy that the long run I had in this game was enjoyable. 
---
For anyone that experienced or knows how serenity ended, landscape wise, has our server followed suit? As in were pibc's final opponents in the drone lands and wicked creek areas when they finally lost?
---
Not deploying would hurt our members more than not making isk ever could. People have been told for months and months to get titans, what good is having them if they see no use other than running havens?
---
Amazing! Very nice

And that's just an Avatar. Imagine what an Imud Hubrau titan can do.

The answer to questions about Eve is almost always "it's situational." Between-keyboard-and-chair skills count for a lot in the situation you're talking about.

PL in 2011 said the same shit, they are now getting dicked on.
---
Thats why nukes are airburst, and something this large would probably be detonated at the edge of space, this way it "hits" a very large amount of the surface area of the planet. If any significant amount of atmosphere is ejected, it would either have to bounce off the surface, Or travel a fairly large distance through the atmosphere before ejecting.

There is one slight mistake in your calculation. If a Levi staggers the 6 Cruise Launchers with Caldari Titan 5, you fire 1 missile every 3.33s (the Bonus shaves off 15s per skill level in titan, its why Cal Titan 5 about doubles the Levis DPS)

I miss EVE 😭 This boi will never fly again.

I want it just for the galactic background, let alone the beautiful ship.

It was kind of sad when the M-O Morsus Mihi faction fortizar died. It was dropped in March 2009 so it made it 10 years.

Sounds about right. This is for May. The war started mid/late May and the first structures in Tribute didn't start going down until around the last week of May, and most of them were Jammers, Jump Gates, and smaller citadels/structures. The first rounds of the really juicy stuff didn't come until the first week of June. 
---
As for losses in Delve. That's during the move up north for the war and the cap umbrella leaving. The first two weeks there were a lot of losses from people who decided to stay and krab anyways or were ignorant of what was happening, and a lot of dreadbombs and roaming gangs happened. This has since died down by quite a bit due to enemy deployments in Delve being cancelled to defend and many of the krabs realizing what was happening or losing too much. 
---
Meanwhile, the north still burns going into late June. Should check the numbers for the next MER to see an estimate of what was lost (excluding pulled rigs).
---
The shape the shells/missiles are most closely resembling would be a cylinder so probably use that formula which makes it squared, though if you want to be really pernickety you could break them down to part cylinder part cone and use a weighted average, though i think the difference would be negligible
---
Ah yes the French

Not even reliable really. It's just that when module cycling breaks it's the high rate of fire weapons that lose the most and the low rate of fire that lose the least.
---
A doomsday being delayed by a minute per cycle is not a big deal, while a dread gun being delayed by a minute per cycle is everything.
---
OMG! Goons are like the Taliban destroying ancient history!!!  sorry :(  just attempting to spin a new narrative ;)
---
OP already did the math for me for this part. 
---
Basically, in the main post, he says that:
---
The mass of the payload (so, fissile material) is 943,660 kg.
---
&gt; Now, the theoretical maximum yield of a fissile warhead is given by the Taylor Limit, which is 6kt/kg of fissile material. Assuming that the denizens of New Eden have the tech to reach that limit, we crunch the numbers and get...
---
&gt; ...5.6 gigatons.
---
That means that 943 660 kg = 5.6 gigatons (assuming that our yield is 100% in accordance with Taylor's limit)
---
I convert it to metric tons for ease of use. 943 660 kg = 943.66 tons.
---
Let's for example look at the artillery with payload case. We determined that the fissile material had a mass of 175.8 metric tons. I determine the proportionality constant between the two payloads. Therefore:   175.8/943.66 = 0.186
---
Now we can find out how much energy is output from *our* amount of fissile material:
---
5.6 gigatons * 0.186 = 1.0416 gigatons
---
So the artillery payload (175.8 metric tons) contains 1.0416 gigatons of TNT if we assume 100% yield in accordance with Taylor's limit.
---
Indeed. Never has truckloads of viscous pyroxeres netted me so much cash...
---
There is no reason for the huge price flux other than the lemmings buying iphones analogy.

open https://evefleetsimulator.com/ give one side Titans + FAX alt and the other side dreadnoughts. See for which number of titans you'd need which number of dreads. Then think again.
---
this is clearly a blackflag post from a goon member no one in ncpl call it the casino war only goons NICE TRY
---
tbh, is shooting undefended citadels significantly more fun than running havens?
---
irl
---
Where did i said "arent"?
---
So I am a old player slowly getting back into the game. My question is where I should be running missions.
---
I want to run missions for now until I fully decide what I want to do endgame and kind of corp I would like to join. I ran L3 missions no problem on a T2 drake in Caldari high sec space. At a time I also had a abaddon that I used to run some T4 missions but that [blew up](https://zkillboard.com/kill/15222068/) when I got mission ganked.
---
I had bought a rattlesnake before I stopped playing close to 6 years ago, I still need around a month to fully use it (t2 launchers). However while looking at other ships I noticed I could fully fly a T2 nightmare. I also started in Caldari but cross trained to Amarr as I find their ships sexy AF. I also have a little more than 8m skillpoints into gunnery (energy) vs a little over 1.5m in missiles; so it kinda made sense to go for a nightmare.
---
Should I still run my missions in Caldari space or not due to dmg res NPC's might have (like angles) or should I pack up and move somewhere else? I do not mind running my drake until I build up rep for L4.
---
Yeah, I mostly did all this to A: Simplify my calculations, and B: Return a lower yield for this weapon. I'm not a nuclear physicist so I'm pretty well unqualified to remark on anything more complex than a simple fission bomb with a 6kt/kg limit for fissile material, and to be honest this thing is terrifyingly destructive as-is. 
---
It's likely anyone who built a weapon like this would just go with a relatively simple fission mechanism because it provides a cheaper and simpler (thus less prone to sudden and catastrophic failure) mechanism and also delivers more than enough destructive power to obliterate anything it is used against.
---
Ur titan sitting at different pos, and put a bridge up to the same cyno as the stratop?

Have a spy toon in a subcap in NS that makes enough money for 7 toons. Not kidding, NS is stupidly retarded easy isk making space, so easy I want it changed myself but I have to use it or I have no chance to keep up with the stuff I am burning to fight NS.
---
If I was better at math, I would try to calculate it lol.
---
One thing I would like to see, is using that damage point to energy conversion applies to some doomsdays. At this point it wouldn't surprise me to findout that they have solar flare or CME levels of energy.
---
Oh, for sure. I bet there's been some regret in the boardrooms of eve over that. The industry output of delve is terrifying.
---
I remember when people said spreading out meant there was no room for the little guy to own space and develop so we had to let space support more people so they'd clump up
---
The first week in June is regarded and evidenced as the start of the summer "slow" for eve.
---
Now this you could argue this was post WWB etc, however if you looked at the image posted, it shows the % average to be similar Year on year.
---
This can be compared going back to 2003, but a point in time needs to be picked for when we believe "Eve started to die."
---
Having played this game from 2004 onward's, for me it was post WWB and changes to Sov mechanics, supers, skill injectors, faucet removal, risk removals, Alphas, rorquals etc etc.. Again this is just my opinion, but what cannot be argued is the numbers as they speak volumes themselves.
---
There is no argument or doubt that the game is in decline, it is just how much. Also the recent event has slightly masked the mass decline, but it will just make the slope / shelf into summer look twice as bad as it is going to...
---
In essence we are now looking at the biggest decline in 12 years and regardless of how we got here, its more about how do we stem the bleed or reverse this.
---
does it account for logi stacking penalties?
---
and you are surprised no one noticed?
---
According to the in-game preview window, the capsule is 4m long.
---
You did not take into account that an XL missile in EVE only has a volume of 0.3 m^(3) and is only 1500kg heavy.

Yes and they were ridiculously fun!

No, it's Patrick.

Why do people keep making post like these...CCP probably has no plans to even remotely put their hands on this game and are just going to keep releasing skins with a half assed medicore lore event

Its ok though because panfam cant rat or mine for 54 days now XDdddd

sucks to have to wait 2 months to mine again xd
---
I guess Newton’s Law of Motion don’t exist in New Eden either.   To impart 4.38 exojoules of
---
KE into an object via acceleration an equal force must be applied in the opposite direction.  The “Kick” of the gun.   A Rag’s stated mass is 2,200,000,000KG and for it to impart that sort of KE into the Arty rounds the reaction force from such a blast would accelerate the entire titan by 63m/s per volley. Technically, a Rag could just fire its cannons and move faster than using its engines.  Also anything that receives a full volley and survives would be taken for quite the ride.  A Naglfar taking a full broadside by a Rag would be accelerated to 88m/s, which is higher than its max velocity of 80m/s.
---
Using V=sqrt(KE/(0.5M).

Correct.

Oh, you sweet summer child.

As a 15 year Eve veteran, having been in most fights against RKK, Evol etc from the start, back in the FA war, FE, Iron, G, being part since the start of MM in 4s, all wars in those time etc very early on have decided never to join any groups associated with bob and mc. Both because of the elitism and arrogance they nurtured on then actual eve forums  and more importantly because you need to have good enemies in a game as long as this one :)
---
A wild tear in my eye appeared as i have heard former alliance mates of Hirr, fsr, shiva and mv joined our foes. :( knowing that most members and directors from those corps were great and fun to play with. Even the name nc. was derogatory of what we were all being part of in the north. sad times but I was happy that you found a new home. Good for you, good move, for a while :) All of you guys have always been very competitive. Hirr moved away later i hear. 
---
I am fairly sure that as long as you are with bob, be and mc, we wont be flying together anytime soon :) 
---
good luck and have fun
---
Ok fine, you get to have a  &lt;3.
---
A beautifull post, not because congrats goons, but because eve is a game and we sometimes forget it and for embracing change, may you be better for it.
---
Noob question, so what happens to their supers if they just keep giving up space until they run out
---
The point is: what does it matter in which subs someone posts in a completely unrelated argument?

According to the creator: yes

"Local repairs work and remote repairs now scale like they do on Tranquility."
---
At least I understand it that way. Not 100% confident that it's proper but whatever tbh. EHE probably doesn't work properly either. Ask the other channel for details. Calculating the stuff for such a brawl "by hand" isn't really difficult and you can even estimate the result just from scaling.
---
You are better off proposing once 1 rorqual enters panic all of the others get a debuff which makes them unable to also enter panic.
---
It was nothing like last war though. 13 total died during the deployment, and 40+ were unanchored. I guess most of the rest across the north were unanchored after that, because I haven't seen any in a while.
---
because why bring 400 dreads when you can bring 400 titans
---
You'd make a great Austin either way.

&gt;how is there any way to compete? they can just squash anyone that even mildly competes

One does not have to oppose them while growing into something that can challenge them.

Also, certain entities in the game have worked very hard to drive other alliances towards the goons, making their current situation far worse.
---
&gt; Oh and lets not forget that the ships resisting this stuff basically violate the basic limits of physics just sitting still and without an active warp drive.
---
What you're saying is, my blaster Vindicator should have knockback.
---
I am well aware of the suit. But it is literally racist (and false) to say that all Chinese players bots. So again, fuck you you racist piece of shit.
---
&gt;a Chinese player sued ccp  
---
Nope
---
This is answered elsewhere in this thread, but I threw out those numbers because they are so obviously bullshit.
---
I mean there's a top speed... There really shouldn't be a top speed (except c of course)
---
Also there's max range on projectiles.. and on missiles
---
Etc etc etc there is *so* much physics EVE doesn't give a shit about. And IMO that's fine.
---
IIRC according to lore, 1 isk is a years worth of food/rent for a normal family. Somebody calculated the price of milk and food using dairy products and frozen food. I think the verdict was that normal people can't afford food or milk. Can't seem to find the post though
---
Either way, eve is unrealistic in so many ways. Still fun to tinker with just to see how ridiculous it all is though
---
Don't give a fuck who I replied to. The statement is racist.
---
Have you experienced any fallout from it personally?
---
I went around some low-sec seeing if it was accurate, and it seemed almost random vs what was there and what the agency showed.
---
I stand corrected then, Thank you. I havent logged in, in something like 2 years so im going off of my hampered memory here.
---
I can't actually find the image I used but I do know it was an export of the physical models of the missiles themselves lined up next to each other with a human for scale.
---
The actual Austin is a bit of a jackass so maybe.
---
A cruise missile snake can solo c4 sites with some bling. Easily if you tinker snake. 
---
Though the payout from c4 sites is generally not worth it, you'd get better isk/hr soloing c3 sites.

Docking like a pro. Checks out.

My newbie naive ass thought it was a more literal term.  When 100 miners and droids are picking apart asteroids and you zoom out far enough it looks like little crabs scavenging about.
---
nah, dinobrains just have a huge victim complex and will grr anyone that wont sign NIPs with them
---
the only way that might work, is if the minor conduits worked as if they were in perimeter systems with 10% buffs i think. which is stupid cause they only spawn in footholds currently
---
124,2s x 0,596 (with orca) x 0,9 (area buff) = 66,6 seconds...

Unless they boson you because you brought everything in on the same spot there will be quite a lot dead Titans in that scenario

Yeah jokes on him, there are no new Eve players.

No.

No? The correct solution will do just that. CCP has not provided the correct solution and it has had the opposite effect. How does this not make sense?
---
Goons are literally letting whoever they want to live, live. As soon as TEST starts putting together a meaningful supercap force, they are going to drop the hammer.
---
But considering TEST fed 300 dreads to Panfam and are still the laughing stock of nullsec, they aren’t stressed.

Why make that point? Who is doing this?
---
In EVE, there is always one critical resource that limits all battles: pilots. \[This includes in TiDi because a major part of the TiDi factor is the pilot count; and this also includes multiboxing because there is a limit to how many accounts one human can control at a time.\] From that limitation, you want to have as many pilots as possible to be in the most effective ships they can be in. And that's what's going on here. Titans, supercarriers, and FAXes are the most powerful individual ships at their given roles, and so when you are limited by the number of individual ships you can deploy and not by the funding you have to deploy them with, you want the best. Dreads are good, but if you had 400 pilots to put in any capital ships of your choice, you'd have most of them in titans or FAXes and not dreads.
---
&gt;  leadership has not changed
---
dj probably wants to have a word with you
---
/wrists
---
IRL.
---
Fuck krabs and their opportunity costs.
---
&gt;How does this not make sense?
---
Let's walk through this.
---
CCP implements something that helps smaller groups in the game.  To make use of it, you have to actually be in a smaller group.
---
In game, Goons split into 47 different entities in game to take advantage of that benefit, while using their out-of-game systems to coordinate and remain a single cohesive entity.
---
Or how about a different r/Eve favorite, "spread out anomalies!!!".  Theta squad could easily cover 3 regions via 3 standing fleets.  Your smaller entity, OTOH, is screwed.
---
There is not a magical anti-big-alliance change that the big alliances can not use to their advantage too.
---
Again, there's this thing called "diplomacy".  Might wanna think about how to use it to your advantage instead of letting Goons use it against you.
---
SMA - In case you were under a rock these last 2 or 3 years, the Goons don't wait your space. They want your dead corpse floating around half naked.  They are kicking in your houses just to get to you, not your space. As for I, I would like to line all of Querious with dead monkeys and I will the moment you reset the GSF and Asher says go.
---
Never knew you could scan pods for implants. What module is it?
---
ok ,now goons can get back to crabbing?nothin to shoot in delve [mate.im](https://mate.im) starving
---
This is actually me
---
Well its either they pulled rigs or dont even use rigs at all. Neither are something to be proud of
---
Take local away from miners.
---
Escape from tarkov :)
---
Wow you’re thick. I don’t literally mean only small in game alliances benefit, but small groups of players. IE the larger a group is (the more densely populated they are) the harder it is to utilize the resources of that area.
---
Spreading out theta across 3 regions would make it easier for other groups to attack them. You’d be surprised how big of a difference being spread out across 3 instead of 1 regions makes.
---
Thank you :)
---
It wouldn't be a CODE post without a third-grade-level misspelling.

What this flair yields is just amazing at times.
---
I mean fair point it was more about leadership not having cycled before and after the big rebranding, rather than never.
---
Frigate?
---
Try a dread, or a couple of RR Leshaks. I used to know a guy who would do it in a Raven by taking advantage of the short range on the sleepers, but that took forever to do. You *can* do it in a bomber, it just takes like an hour or so to do it.

&gt;oh wow people have different humor than myself!!! what a surprise

Eve is not bigger than that with fatigue-free Ansiblex gates, cynos and bridging. That's a big part of the problem, the big blobs can project anywhere.
---
CCP have apparently forgotten why jump fatigue was needed in the first place.
---
There's a sci-fi series I'm reading where the weapons are on a similar absurd scale (the word gigatons gets thrown around quite a lot) and in a lot of cases the entire ships structure acts as a heat sink. Superconducting nanotubules laced throughout the hull also route that heat back into weapons systems and something described as "cooling lasers," which is never described in any particular depth.

Suffice to say that many AI piloted craft come out of engagements glowing red-hot.

T3D is probably the minimum for the easiest sleeper sites. Gila is better, but not great. BS is ideal, with most using Praxis or Rattle.

This is lovely and wholesome.

I do wonder how to bump a rorqual

And you are a moron.
---
Sarcastic or not, the statement is racist. Period. A bad joke is still a bad joke so stfu.
---
So I hate to tell you this, but you are wrong. It had nothing to do with you thinking my response was from something you "called out". I threw out some bait, and what do you know,  hook , line and sinker y'all inhaled it. See I responded to a dingleberry being edgy thinking nothing of it. Then the replies started coming in I ran with it because I wanted to see some true colors. You guys sure delivered. That's all I needed to see.
---
 Again you are wrong. I left amapd bc it was obvious to me that I was not welcome there. Everyone took that as I wasn't going to pay Casper back at all, and the tinfoil hat syndrome started there. 
---
Keep at it though cunt. You miss 💯 of the shots you don't take cupcake.
---
James 315 and a small group of people know exactly what he meant. Covfefe.
---
thanks, that sort of makes sense. so krabbing is grinding and ignoring like... other aspects of the game, yeah?
---
I mean, MM was about as elitist as BoB was. They were just more NATO-y about it and less Imperial Rome.
---
Also NCdot is it's own thing. Founded by the OG Triumvirate guys, and populated by a pretty diverse mix of corps. Former corps from Alliances like Morsus Mihi and Razor actually have a lot more influence than anything else. DICE, which wasn't even a BoB founding corp, is the only corp in NCdot that was with those guys that has any kind of relevance in the alliance. RKK's dead, BNC's dead, Finfleet was always kind of in the background and still is to this day, and Evolution's stepped back from any kind of politics or major activity. BoB died with IT Alliance, people need to stop beating a dead horse with a stick. Even 401k which was pretty much a BoB reunion wasn't even remotely the same thing, they went for a small scale nomadic pvp, BL type deal.
---
fc what is pilot cost
---
a titan pilot really isn't much more expensive than a dread pilot.
---
only when you fly into the pos shields
---
I was in nullsec for basically my whole time in EVE until I joined a WH Corp a couple weeks ago. 
---
I took like 9 months off from the game between then when my CEO of the nullcorp I was in said to start training more VNI alts and get in rorqs so that you could be spinning and mining while on stratops lmfao.
---
Fuck that shit.
---
Yes spread the wisdow. The world needs more wisdow. 
---
It also needs more “M”s
---
You know M as in Moron, Misspelling,

I honor of Jay Leno

PL and NC used to not even hold SOV.
---
Me to man, I love the meme but I dont even play so have no idea why its hilarious.
---
It's too safe because the game is dying &lt;3333
---
Nothing wrong with a deployment. Trust me, your guys will be asking to go home after two weeks. This is why we live in a C2 NSS. Best of both worlds.
---
Oh really? All right. 
---
Take a laser, right? Except it's really powerful. Like, absurd. I'm talking petawatt level. Shoot that at a planetary body. 
---
The atmosphere doesn't light on fire. Nothing so milquetoast as that. The atmosphere in the immediate area immediately explodes in a massive fusion reaction.
---
The laser tears through this hellish conflagration and reaches the crust. The elements here are too heavy to fuse, but they do their best, and in the process instantly convert to million degree plasma. This obeys basic gas laws and expands proportionately to its force, firing outwards through the atmosphere. 
---
The radiation pulse from the atmospheric fusion flare, which is mostly hard X and gamma rays, barbecues any living thing within line of sight. The heat pumped into the atmosphere alone is enough to raise the air temperature on the other side of the planet to a couple hundred degrees just before the shock wave hits.
---
Meanwhile, that massive plume of plasmized crust and fused atmospheric gases? That's blasting out from the planet at some pretty insane velocities. Remember Newton's third law?
---
The one side of the planet had now been transformed into a giant rocket engine. That orbit is shifting. Not a lot; planets are pretty big, after all. But it also doesn't take much of an orbital shift to cause an extinction level event. To say nothing of the fact that one side of the planet has been practically burnt down to the mantle.
---
Turns out if you pump enough energy into pretty much anything, you get some terrifying results.
---
I understand that knowing the rigs that were on there involves trusting gsf but also trusting the spin of your leadership. But we did at least get most if not all of the regions we have hit or will hit scanned and at least a decent chunk of citadels that show unrigged killmails did at the time of scanning a few weeks ago have rigs on them. For many structures the rig cost is not much but there have been large+ structures that show some decently priced rigs pulled before we got around to initial refs.
---
It also kinda [glows](https://imgur.com/gallery/beRC5f9)  kinda
---
Yes, they do...  I acknowledge that they do in fact function in space.  They just aren't very good at it.  They also work better in an atmosphere than a vaccum.  Add to that the massive amount of heat generated by weapons systems and they're worse than useless.  Not to mention you now have these vital systems as massive fragile protrusions from your combat vessel?  Remember we are talking about wicking heat away from massive weapons.
---
No... You're a moron. That's an actually Chinese Frat player. He was pointing out that, you basically said that with your previous posts.
---
So, you're not only an idiot, but you're pretty much behaving in the same racist manner as what you're accusing other people of doing. Or else why talk about "WinterCo botting titans" when it's pretty apparent that bots are rampant in every alliance, every bloc, right now?
---
If it wasn't for the whole 'getting sued over IP' thing I'd want to buy a high quality print of that from you. That is a gorgeous rendering of my favorite hull.
---
Just wait till daddy goon withdraws the super umbrella.

GOTG is going to get fucked into the middle of next week.
---
Enter a system and notice 4 or so VNIs.   Find out which structure they all warped to.  Log a Sabre off in front of that structure.  Wait 5 or so minutes.  Log back in and bubble immediately.  Notice that all the VNIs make it through the bubble to the structure.  Also notice there are no drones out in space.  
---
How did that happen?  As soon as local showed a neut the bots recalled drones and warped.  Any normal person not botting is going to take a few critical seconds to even notice that someone is in local.  Then they are going to take another second or two to decide to recall drones.  Most people will simply align to the safe and wait until something shows on dscan.  
---
Note that you can still catch bots this way if their polling of local is a little too slow.
---
Aren’t we all autistic?
---
wow, I haven't played in 3 years, this meme still going?

---
Because it would be impossible for Goons to operate as a collection of smaller organizational units.  They might call them sigs.....  :eyeroll:
---
&gt; Spreading out theta across 3 regions would make it easier for other groups to attack them
---
Again, Theta is big enough that they can cover those regions as well as any other alliance's super umbrella.
---
&gt; You’d be surprised how big of a difference being spread out across 3 instead of 1 regions makes.
---
No, I really wouldn't.  Because you really don't grasp just how many supers they have waiting to drop.
---
Can you provide the images of the scale you described?
---
Unfortunately I can't find the image I used. I'll look around and see if I can find it, though.
---
Back in the CFC days, we used to take 3 or 4 fleets of Megathrons, Hurricanes, and Drakes against N3, and regularly get "chaos dunked" by their supercap supremacy. Their response was always that money should be a counter to numbers, and that their supercap supremacy was a good thing for the game.
---
Now those Hurricane pilots have titans and supers, and somehow it's just so unfair. Nerf diplomacy.
---
As I replied to someone in a thread recently, C2 (C3/HS) is pretty great for a small industrial or farming group. C2 (C5/NS) or (C6/NS) is well known to be great for rolling for content. C4 (C3/C5) is pretty good for mid level groups. C5 (C5) is where a lot of high class groups live for rollable content and farming.
---
LOL!  
---
I more meant stuff like the cargo hold and structural integrity. Your blasters aren't actually blowing enough material off a target to knock it around much.
---
Not unless you're living there alone, which would be a bit of a poor experience. If you have 10 people in your corp then you only have to do 1/10 the scanning.
---
just exxagerating a bit to make the point clear^^ someone downvoting is bitter/salty though as it seems.
---
Bots ahoy!
---
Yeah, you're a K162 away from a C2 (C3/HS) so you'll have high sec exits pretty often.
---
Literally Pve online, why has bob forsaken us
---
In fresh sites, you will only be greeted by sleepers in an instrumental core reservoir. Sleepers will spawn in the other sites after 15-20 minutes, so if you are in a frigate just set a timer and then get ready to warp out at 15 mins.
---
I’m amazed about the different Orgs controlling regions of space, and what could always happens at the edges right between each other. Can’t wait for SC to get that big. Stay Awesome guys
---
Yes, but you would need to pick your battles based on which pirate frig you run into, what you're flying, and the limits of your own skill. It's very possible for a tricked out T1 to clobber a faction or T2, especially at the Frigate size, but a lot of that comes down to piloting and playing to your strengths. If you're in a Blaster Frigate and you run into a webbing Daredevil I would not put great odds on you, for example.
---
Looks like that page only applies to IRC to me
---
Isn’t this because Goons we’re deployed and officially not ratting in Delve? These are goons not ratting numbers.
---
RIP 4O1k
---
It's bot o'clock!
---
Beep boop beep boop
---
That is what we developed into. We did not start out that way.
---
Siiiiick! :D
---
1. Spodumain prices alone are up ~20%, that alone translates to ~500B isk increase based on April MER and assuming mining in Delve was ~25% spodumain.
---
2. Yes, markets will adjust, I don't deny that. I was simply stating you can't outright say "GOONS LOST X AMOUNT OF ISK IN OPPORTUNITY COSTS" without incorporating an inflated ore pricing, heavily inflated ice pricing, and inflated moon ore pricing that would fuel a higher-than-average revenue for the first 2, maybe 3, weeks back in Delve.
---
OK, I can get behind this. Damage a ship enough to blow open their cargohold. Scoop loot and run lol
---
Hey if goons don't have to count titans that died that we can all see the mails for, we don't have to count rigs that may have never existed. I think that's a fair trade.
---
&gt;Express yourself in ways that are constructive
---
I feel like spamming "Undock" meets this criterion
---
Rules only applying to the official in-game Help channel and the IRC coldfront server. Calm down Wally.

thats not what the GM is telling me. Almost all of NSH was reported and warned because we spammed local to SMA to tell them to undock and fight us, or we linked our Bingo card for their SOTA

I wont link exactly what is said in the ticket or the GM, but it seems REALLY odd that all of a sudden this is an issue. I am literally known for my Reddit/Local banter, and all of a sudden this is changed?!
---
This policy is in relation to the Help channel and IRC. Way to intentionally and maliciously glom over a crucial detail in order to suit your own narrative and try to farm karma on the back of anti-CCP rage.
---
Shut the fuck up.
---
At this point it would make more sense if CCP lined up eve for "closure"  using drifters / eve gate / whatever reason they can think up that rolls with lore  but give people an "out" -  and the out should be eve 2.  New galaxy,  same + new ships.   let existing players get a slight head start by evaccing with limited materials from Eve 1 to start in eve 2.  off you go!
---
Yeah you're right because Delve made 8 tril in April 2019 (compared to 5 tril in May) but my point still stands.  7k people are outratting all of Goons in Delve.
---
So why was most of NSH reported, and given this explanation?
---
I think they are stretching it now to local
---
Sorry m8, been filled for 6 years, but fc may start reviewing resumes if the position ever opens.
---
You're allowed to destroy an alliance which took years to build, potentially resulting in the RL consequences of the alliance leader seeing his creation being obliterated mercilessly. This might even lead to depressiong, or god forbid something even worse if someone has invested so much time into it....
---
BUT YOU CAN'T CALL SOMEONE A BASTARD BECAUSE THAT'S A BAD WORD AND CCP DOESN'T LIKE BAD WORDS
---
My issue is this is what a GM is trying to tell us all, we got warned for doing it in local.
---
This is great, i it acrylics or oils?

They mostly come at night.
---
Mostly.
---
rip goons
---
What good is having a titan in goons when they still never get used other than to sit on a Fortizar / Keepstar waiting for a chance to jump in for actual combat besides citadel bashing?   
---
The majority of titan kills from goons have been each other... So i'm not really sure what use you're seeing them get.
---
Local spam has always been something you can get reported for. Move along.
---
for spamming a bingo card 5 times in a row though? haha

You aren't clever, no one cares. End of discussion.

I have lived out of POSs, NPC stations, been ganked belt ratting, and doomsdayed by titans years before I ever actually saw one in game.
---
I'm not bitter, nor would I be bitter, because the vicious circle continues and will continue. All these new players screeching on reddit need to learn that if you pray for rain you gotta some times play in the mud.

The funniest bit is the risk averse streamer calling the PVPer a pussy.

Splitting the player base. You want to kill Eve? Because that's how you kill Eve.

that's not ironic
---
For most gas sites a battlecruiser can do it. Search for rykkis wh pve guide and compare your tank to what the site puts out with a tool like Pyfa. You want to project dps to 20km or better because you'll be webbed, and probably need a cap battery if you use an active tank because some of the npcs neut.

"Play EVE! Create an empire ... erm ... umm ... join Goons ..."
---
Yes Goons might be enjoying their victories.
---
Is it a positive thing when the game is now so limited and monotonous? Just think how much worse Game of Thrones would have been if it was just the North vs the South, no dragons, no white walkers, no in fighting, just the south slowly crushing the north.
---
Just wanted to nitpick that a ton and a tonne are technically different, and I'm assuming since you went with the metric kg, you meant the metric ton, which is 1000kg. Otherwise a fascinating read!

Sure - if they had major infrastructure upgrades ready - but they don't.

Apparently you didn't understand the point. The static wormhole would only allow a shuttle or pod through, so there's no way to seed any resources into the new cluster. It would effectively be starting over from scratch in a rookie ship without wiping out New Eden cluster.

Dude, it's more fun if we pretend that we hate each other!
---
&lt;3
---
Not only this, but goons said over and over that this would happen, and nobody listened. I guess it's easier to repeat "spodbrain" for years instead of adapting to a new meta. Only TEST listened, and it seems to be working well for them.
---
I know it isnt what you're asking,  but you'll be way better off getting 2 friends, using a scythe, attack battlecruiser, and a webbing/painting cruiser to kill frigs and help the ABC apply. You just said you have poor hole control, meaning that snake is going to die and maybe sooner rather than later.  C3 ratting with no bling is going to be like 50m per hour so you're going to need 10 hours of grinding to replace that snake, where each person my way risks less than 100m, and its way more fun to fly with a couple friends.
---
Don't try to understand GM decisions. You'll drive yourself mad. Logic is not part of their decision making process.
---
Just nod sarcastically, forget about it and move along.
---
You're coming off as extremely salty my friend. It's just a video game.
---
Are you suggesting supers don't rat? Because a lot of super carriers are used specifically for ratting.
---
r
---
Grrrrr Gewns...
---
Production is kinda worthless for T1 things, honestly. The margins and volume just isn’t there most of the time. Instead you should look into T2 manufacturing of ships and just move them where there’s money to be made.
---
Wouldn't have been as bad if you had any sense of staying on beat.
---
Most people who post here don't actually play eve so it's not that hard
---
Cringe
---
Look at the white knights, here to save EVE. Get off your high horse...Goons aren't building huge super fleets to "make the game better", they were tired of being slapped around and wanted to compete. 
---
Stop trying to make it seem like Goons are the second coming of the savior. Goons finally got the ability to be a super power and took it and ran. That's the end of the story.
---
It's just framing it in a really dumb way, I'm not really making an effort to "refute" anything. Allies tend to support each other, this is not unique to Eve. To call it a "Not us against us attitude" is just framing a normal thing as some kind of horrible negative that sets Goons somehow apart from every other group. It does not.
---
I mean the alternative is to suggest pamfam was too incompetent to rig their sotiyos lol.
---
Lol you're not getting the point of my argument.  Here is [April 2019](https://webimg.ccpgamescdn.com/7lhcm73ukv5p/1g7QFCy505KOTpxAkGak4x/3bc6dfc7ffb2c8fa6c10828b6372ebbf/3_npc.bounties.by.region_bar.png) where 7k people placed 2nd right behind all of Delve.  
---
Let's not get too stuck up on this "Goons are currently deployed so stats are off" thing.   Try to focus on the number \~7k.
---
Point I'm trying to make is that Branch is literally the aids that is rotting the game from the inside out and deserves to get its nose hairs tickled with shoes.
---
There should be a case study done on CODE. I've never seen any group in any MMO elicit such high quality tears from so many people before. Like, just get a permit, man.
---
BRB gonna go clean up Jita local
---
I have BPO for mines :D
---
401K was where a lot of us actually buried the hatchet there was still a lot of old school hate in Shiva for Evol and vice versa.
---
Instead we put politics aside and just focused on having fun it was pretty good while it lasted!
---
M8, this isn't counterstrike.
---
Wow don't be mean.   At least NC/PL are actual players playing the game.
---
Imagine thinking a 6 APM refit takes skill lmao.
---
Big difference was that NC &amp; PL were always small relative to other alliances and coalitions in terms of individuals - usually no more than 400-500 real people in either alliance, and depending on the time they would have been even smaller. Even today NC has only about 700-800 real people.
---
With modern eve, brought to you with skill injectors and rorquals, the game has degenerated into a pure numbers game, even more so than it was in the past.
---
Spod is hell of a drug
---
Yeah that’s my concern, too.  Love this idea though for an eve 2.0, even just as an experiment (or series of experiments). 
---
New Eden is just too well mapped / developed and resource rich, and WH space is just too random for my personal tastes. 
---
Maybe play with parameters like
---
-much scarcer resources
---
-orders of magnitude more systems
---
-maybe whole constellations only have 1-2 ores or 1-2 PI resources
---
-System gates have to be built?  Or at the least, upgraded to support larger vessels going through
---
-Heck maybe the universe resets everything but the ship and cargo you’re in every so often as new stuff is tried
---
But I’m sure you guys have more developed ideas out there. Love the idea of trying new things in a parallel universe with limited connections though.
---
Yeah, 401k was a pretty fun time. Haven't really played except for casual solo PvP since the end of that. Was great flying alongside you guys, though.
---
All sides are winning and should be given trophies.
---
Kinda
---
The Fax nerf is actually more effective than a dread buff would have been
---
I realize that the whole *"unbeatable evil titan blob; grrr goons"* thing is now a recognized mental illness in a large portion of the EVE population... but it may interest you to know that this is actually *not* the first time a single group has appeared absolutely unbeatable. And yet, they were beaten.
---
So instead of whining to CCP about resetting the game so you don't have to work for it yourself, how about you put on your thinking cap, grow some balls and try to *earn* some power the good old fashioned way? Nobody said getting power in EVE was easy, or quick. Wasn't either of those things for the Goons, or BoB, or any of the other big bois that came before them. Not sure why you'd think CCP would just hand it to you now.
---
*Not* a goon, btw. Entitled snowflakes just bug me.
---
Agreed, this is 100% a black flag post. Some of the names are wrong, some of the detailing is off too... the incorrect details also just so happen to line up with the historically revisionist goon fairy tales.
---
I rate this 1/10 for obvious fiction that took way too much effort and still got it wrong on the finer points.
---
I use the common vernacular and Casino war seems to me to be the most common description people call that war around these parts these days. I am wondering what we will do for whiskey night this Friday ;) Oh and RIP PL. NCPL is really not a thing anymore. Perhaps NCPH would be a better description as PL has almost vanished. Sorry Bro, maybe you guys will rebuild but I honestly don't see that happening. Let's hope I am wrong.

It's actually three sites per hour and an alt to tackle the drifter is completely unnecessary unless you are handicapped and cannot use depots.
---
Because you're cancer.
---
You are 100% wrong.
---
Picture rolling in combat and defence fleets for your alliance, fighting the good fight- meanwhile Senor "I NEED ISK" is hiding back in your territory refusing to help, always running PVE to fatten their own wallet while you fight to basically protect them.
---
I’m getting that feeling.
---
Yes we could, we'd go back to importing stuff from jita again.
---
My point...
---
Exactly. Eventually, some have made comments like in the bottom panel. "I'm important, I bring in money to pay for all of your PvP! Appreciate me!" Or some variable of that with different wording and intent behind the message: Appreciation, boasting, complaining, etc.
---
That’s amazing the detail is fantastic!
---
Shuttles have 10m³ cargo, some of them even 20m³.  
---
And we all know what EVE players are like.
---
Bottom feeder

are you calling me a cross dresser!?
---
*sky goes dark*
---
  Fuck sake the capsuleers are firing black hole nukes in orbit again
---
Good thing it's stuff blown up in a vacuum
---
Nonsense. 
---
DeadCo is a goon pet, and there are no bots in goons.
---
This would not work because it does not limit resource transfer, it would only tax it heavily; skill points are a resource. PLEX and injector demand would multiply and people would convert all their wealth into these by adding Omega time and injecting as much SP as possible.
---
Then a pod only, and you get a new corvette on the other side to start with :3
---
I have not attributed anything to his/her race. Therefore, to say I am being racist is laughable and apparent that you don't know the meaning of the word.
---
Also, how would I ascertain that they were a Chinese player? Fucking magic? This is literally the first I've heard that the person in question was Chinese (someone else said they were in Frat, but so are a lot of non-chinese). I have literally no clue who the loser was that responded to me, and I don't care to. It doesn't matter the color of your skin. To lump an entire race into a stereotype of being botters in both categorically wrong but extremely racist. No matter what your race is.
---
/r/theydidthemath
---
&gt; I was like "there's no way a ship that size can hold hundreds of missiles that size and have the infrastructure to move them from cargo to magazine to launcher."
---
I choose to believe the items in our hold aren't assembled missiles, but the proper amount of parts to build X number of missiles, broken down and flat packed. Reload time is how long it takes the assembly system under the launchers to put a new magazine of care packages together and shove it in the express launcher to happytown.
---
Because if I don't I get pissed.
---
Which is still mind numbing that there are that many krabs in Delve/Fountian who either: A- Don't ever open Jabber. B- Have Jabber open but do not give a damn about the coalition. But I will be interested to see the June report as that will be a full month of war (if it last the whole month).  
---
That's the whole point of a war. You put down you shovels and pitch folks, pick up your sword, and start taking heads off shoulders. The point isn't to make money during the war, it's to inflict damage on your opponent *then* make more isk while your enemy is picking up body parts and trying to rebuild from scratch.
---
Not virtue signalling. I'm an extremely conservative guy. Just don't like racists is all. You would do well to feel the same way.
---
So wspace but stupid, got it

How would we know that? It's not like we could warp around w/ our current scanning gear at our current speeds. Perhaps the first expatiation could be we players are working as a unidentified team for months to map the star cluster and take control from the rats? I see Frigates, destroyers and cruisers being mainstream. And the resources to field a large battleship fight being unheard of.
---
What's to explain?
---
Lasers. Are. Cool. 
---
Seems pretty self explanatory to me :D
---
He literally didn't say anything about Goons
---
Appearently not, otherwise you wouldn't have made your comment about competitive games in the first place.
---
Lmao we still bought stuff and fought wars just as well before rorqs became a thing.
---
good point, pod only then :)
---
i wonder how long it will take until they get titan bloped.
---
&gt;They bet Eve on the success of WoD and Dust and VR and Nova and probably others I'm forgetting or don't know about.
---
This right here, they should have bet on and invested in EVE. EVE was their golden goose and the starved it looking for a golden goose. Look how many taters dump money in the idea of a space MMO (SC) while this one could have evolved so much further. 
---
If you want to know the investment future of eve, have a look at the state of black desert online. Same owners.
---
Are sleepers an NPC faction?  I don't think I have seen any.  Maybe they are in a different region.  Thanks for the tip though.  I might try looking for gas sites in a quiet low sec space one day.
---
Lol I'm not going to delve, enjoy zero local content.
---
Will that corvette have a free tritanium too?
---
Shoutout to NC for not throwing a fit then disbanding their alliance and biomassing.
---
When you're talking about EM energy being released in this magnitude, it doesn't matter that it's in a vacuum. Shits getting fucked up, yo.
---
I recall the stagnation that was goons and NCPL owning all sov... God that was dull
---
&gt; anyone who was in the goonswarm incursion Sig deserves to be banned  
---
well, fuck you too, buddy
---
&gt;trying to fix the current titan blob fest.
---
Right. I guess he was talking about some *other* titan blob fest.
---
The idea really had nothing to do w/ goons/cfc, bob, NCPL, etc. Just looking for interesting ideas to keep the current that has so much history and everyone has worked so hard for yet generate excitement for new unexplored content where mistakes of the past could be addressed.
---
As a Goon who fought during and throughout the Casino War, that was some of the most crazy fights I've been involved with in my time in EVE. I've never been spammed with so many fleets in a war. Even though we lost, we fought like hell going down and I had a lot of fun.
---
For reference: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSbMMEBlM5BAFXldnnX3GDGfUp02OAuMznRljKkbpH4Ff3SyNTrkyEjHSJGkNJsDPqypSZw3sQmQ1Ta/pubhtml#

That's not necessarily true for thermonuclear weapons on Earth.  The high thermal radiation output from the flash would cause simultaneous fires over a large area, which (at least on Earth) causes there to be a heavy atmospheric updraft that draws in cold air from the sides, feeding the fires aggressively.
---
If a spacecraft is the target, that effect won't work out that way, but the amount of thermal energy would still be substantial.

Smoke less weed?
---
Oh yup you’re right.  What a fucking atrocity.  How could they do this to that poor innocent eve mogul business.   You guys are 100% right and I’m waaaaaaaayyyyyyyy out of line.  Yup.  Sure.
---
The only change I’d suggest is to include querious in the delve numbers since the Goons also use about half of it where it overlaps into delve umbrella range. Using this will add another ~1T to mining losses and 1.5T to ratting losses.
---
I'll cop to the first two but I will fight you on the last two.
---
As soon as I get enough isk to buy another carrier.
---
This is true, but the explosion would have to be on the surface of the ship, as I've explained in another comment heat and pressure cannot transfer through a vacuum as there is no medium for it to transfer.
---
This is probably it.
---
Except that's precisely what you are talking about: creating a separate instance of the game where Goons/Legacy/etc... don't have any of the power they've established in the old one. Where people could go on to grab power without having to fight the current powerful groups for it.
---
"Stop you violated the law!"
---
I’m predicting quite a few players will be brought to high sec for a public execution soon^tm
---
RIP EVE 2019
---
&gt;TLDR: Potentially 7k people (likely less) are outratting all of Goons in Delve.
---
Firstly, not everyone in delve is ratting. Secondly, not all of goons live in delve, nor does their recent deployment mean many of them are even **in** Delve. Hell, their current Mining/ratting output is less than half what was produced in FEB/MAR.

No arguments that branch is filled with turbo bears, but you’re giving them a bit too much credit here. May as well say that you’re taller than someone who bent to tie their shoelaces.
---
Oh wait guys I got it....
---
production of another rorqual in the region causes all Rorquals in the region to experience degradation thereby lowering Hull HP and increasing drone cycle times.  Effect is static even if you move the rorquals out of the region and persists for 1 year.  
---
Transporting a rorqual to another region doubles the effect into the imported region.  
---
Am I dOiNg It RiGhT

That's not the case.  Thermal energy transfers through a vacuum via [radiative transfer,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_transfer) while kinetic energy will be carried by the bomb's own material as well as being generated by rapid heating of the target's material.

I did specify in my comment below that only electromagnetic radiation (whether ionizing or not) would be the only thing hitting the ship. But the thermal damage a thermonuclear devices on earth perform are based off superheating the air, so that's why I specified the differences between radiation heating the armor vs the explosion heating the armor.
---
Main thing i hate about this war is the cringe goon line members figuring out what reddit is
---
I like it. It's completely over the top and self aware of it being an act for the camera. Reminds a bit of Nicolas Cage.
---
&gt;the thermal damage a thermonuclear devices on earth perform are based off superheating the air
---
That's not at all accurate.  Flash burns and fires from nuclear weapons are a direct result of radiative transfer at wavelengths where the air is transparent.
---
How do you know they're reported?  Did one salty boi say he reported you in local?  Is this another "I heard from a guy, who's totally connected into CCP that everyone was reported?"
---
Or make them work differently with autos, e.g. guns receive 10% of dps given by overloading without overloading, but overloading gives less dps instead to compensate.
---
So is stereotyping the primarily Chinese alliance as being more bot-heavy than other organizations. Which is exactly why you got called out by him, and what the 'racist' part of your post was.
---
Personally, I don't care, I'm not Chinese, nor in Fraternity. Just pointing that it's a bit ridiculous calling him racist, when he's a Chinese player using not just sarcasm, but basically pointing out what was 'between the lines' in your statement, to accuse you of doing that very thing by singling out WinterCo as being a 'botting alliance'.
---
You single out WinterCo for having a large amount of botting titans, WinterCo is a primarily Chinese organization, ergo you're basically saying "The Chinese are botters", and he pointed that out. Simple enough?
---
I'm talking about the aftermath of the bomb, the fires, the smoke, the atmospheric changes. Yes the initial blast of electromagnetic radiation is damaging, but not nearly compared to the aftermath of such an explosion.
---
If the alliance leader is so thoroughly connected to Eve that he cannot separate his in-game and out-of-game lives, he should probably take a step back anyways...
---
That's bc they are all in 1dq at this point
---
you... do know the game is free to play, right?
---
linemember #4560672636822450 tries to justify this graph by saying his friends are also rectal cancer.

No way OP is in NC.
---
I'm highly sceptical of the numbers as 8 months ago this was the case https://i.imgur.com/X04ZAO2.png
---
No they would want all other rorqual within 1,000km to immediately and unknowingly self destruct leaving all mods/drones in space to loot.
---
yeah, but i have to use the family computer to play it since my laptop is WEAK and ive been busy.
---
I'm predicting between 5-10 will be brought to highsec as a token to appease the masses.  Meanwhile, their 50 alt accounts and buddies will continue botting away as always.  But keep that positive attitude up son!
---
Oh looks it's u/BBTB2 , the goon-AI mastermind that has a preset response to everything that seems even remotely anti-imperium. 
---
Do you actually read the comments that you respond to or are you just furiously jerking off on your keyboard?
---
Fair enough.  My point is that these weapons produce monumental amounts of electromagnetic energy that has no trouble radiating through vacuum and heating a target.  Of course, accuracy counts, because thermal energy on target decreases with the inverse square of how far away the weapon is when it detonates.
---
Regarding kinetic effects:  Lack of atmosphere also means lack of damping of these effects.  It's likely you'd produce tiny fragments of molten metal from the bomb itself traveling at extremely high speed until they hit something, and that's not likely to be very spaceship-friendly (although Eve spaceships seem to be very resistant to that type of damage compared to the real thing.)
