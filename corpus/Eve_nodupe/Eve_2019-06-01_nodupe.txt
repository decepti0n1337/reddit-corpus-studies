GET IN A CORP, GET IN A CORP, GET IN A CORP.

---
Honestly this can not be stressed enough, even a bad corp is better then none. Do your tutorials, then look at new bro corps. You want one that will support you and not just use you as a tax source.
---
Eve uni is mainly class room style learning. PH is more on the job style learning. I am not sure about brave new bros, i would not be surprised if they are close to ph.
---
I noticed some of your follow-ups, and I want to thank you for doing them. I think your tight and consistent script of questions is really good, and I would actually encourage you to keep doing it this way rather than going into more depth than you're already doing. Candidates have plenty of opportunities to opt into deeper explanations of things they care about. I care most about getting to know them in the first place.
---
Replying to the first part, that's not true. There games out there where F2P playerbase is there just to keep the paying players well entertained, to keep the fighting going. That's like buying your paying costumers with free access to your contents.
---
That's why I mentioned Planetside 2, don't know if EVE applies to that tho..
---
Replying to the second part, that's a very good suggestion, I will keep that in mind. Thanks a lot!
---
You clearly don't understand sarcasm
---
u/Vily_R As a member of a bloc, you are obviously going to pump the other candidates from your bloc. So let's look at the implied question: Who's next?

Gorgeous.  This is changing my 'triple screen' mind.

Ships are disposal, you will die. It is not a if but a when. 
---
If it is not green, blue or purple, then it must die.
---
I mean...as has been said many times - we warned there was war.  We warned that Delve would not be safe.  But some people want to take the risk.  Nothing of value lost.
---
As others told me there are multiple path to choose where you can still enjoy the gameplay while being an Alpha. I will try those and then consider the subscription!
---
Except it didn't!  Look if like the game and want to play it just pay for the sub, if not just move on. What difference does it make if spend money on a sub or cosmetics?
---
If Mittens(pee-butt) said so then it must be true. It is known.
---
Just as an add on, I wouldn't care as much at all if there was some other reward for trying the new content, but there isn't. If the npcs shot them more, cool, if there was alternative payouts, cool. But there aint.  
---
Just doesn't make sense you can stay on grid with 80 npcs, not be affiliated with the fleet they're engaging and somehow never get shot.
---
Not the right story. Actual AAR: 
---
Stain groups began entoising the VYJ ihub and tcu, in an attempt to push of test defense forces they were going to bridge in a fleet onto the node. Titan jumps instead of bridge. It escapes first tackle only to warp off into the waiting arms of a dread bomb.
---
where's meccy? hes got to be around here somewhere
---
We don't deserve Cymek anymore.

Who is surprised that after 16 years CCp still dont know that making salvage a good part of and or most of the reward for stuff that happens in high sec is ass retarded

---
we just taking a break and lmao that did age poorly
---
i wonder what this would be like if you could hear it too
---
You weren't tricked, you just have unrealistic expectations. Big difference.
---
Because of the nature of Eve’s is player run economy giving free accounts the means to collect building mats at a high rate would collapse the market and create a race to the bottom and de-incentivize many other parts of industry.
---
I have two Omega accounts, I only have to sub one account every other month by running all 6 toons doing PI, mining high class wormholes in a pair of Expedition frigates, I like doing all that and still have ISK left over to shoot at stuff in the ships I like to fly, AF, t3d, Strats and Asterios.
---
Regardless of how you feel about the F2P presentation, you will pay in cash or time if you want to get ahead, if you like mining and exploring only, then you can enjoy it.
---
I enjoy it, but I like explosions, hunting, and being hunted.
---
This is amazing, show it to my entire family now.  🙂
---
This is going to cost me a lot of money op. Thanks!
---
I would really like to follow the same method you are applying to gain the needed ISK to keep Omega up.
---
Don't you some detailed guides to do that? It would be really useful!
---
Maybe I've been too much on the F2P side of gaming industry..
---
My goodness that's a fine model
---
Pikes Peak? If so, you live about 10 minutes from me. Small world. (Unless that's a completely different mountain.)
---
Choose a path that the venture is useful in. The best example I know is by going into gas huffing in wormholes. You can make decent isk that way as an alpha
---
Don’t you have phones?
---
I will try to find a guide teaching me how to follow that path and stick to it!
---
AIDER and MBLOC are back... Shit is heating up! Now let’s avoid capitals and all that shit and set fire with cruisers and below
---
Dude, if peligro comes out at eve North and shows they have new software that is reducing mean time to detection of bots, or they are banning more bots, or they are taking steps to reduce the effectiveness of RMT botting, I will be very happy.
---
But we both know they dont give a shit, they aren't providing the resources or taking the steps to reduce botting agressively, they are worried about what microtransaction they can sell next.

&gt; For those who don’t know it, the database servers are two Lenovo x880 dual CPU servers with 768 GB RAM. We knew that "Lenovo does have a special clip designed for the FLEX platform where you essentially dock together servers, much like GPU SLI, so when this clip was put in place and we fired up the server, the windows operating system see’s 4x CPUs and 1.5 TERABYTES of RAM!"

/u/querns_gsf where are you?

"" People create effects in the game when not logged in all the time. E.g. if I moved a titan force greater than TEST's in Esoteria right now, you'd stop Rorqual mining and possibly capital ratting, if not an evacuation (see NC). The effect is very similar to cloaky campers. Not the actuality of someone being at the keyboard, but the possibility of getting tackled/die that makes you dock. "
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I disagree. the effects like that are because there exists a counter that is in play. My comments mostly center around the fact that there is no counter to cloaky camping. You can try to bait and kill and thats about it. But since your opponent isn't actually at the keyboard your literally trying to bait nothing. The effects of forces coming into play are not the same as the effects of uncounterable nuisances.
---
" You as a nullsec dweller have intel networks, supercap umbrella mechanics with no feasible counters, fatigue free jump gates, cyno beacons, spy networks, instantly updating local, and more. Does it really bother you that much for attackers to have at least some mechanics in their favor? "
---
intel networks are not nearly as strong when viewed from the inside as the outside, and supercap umbrellas have plenty of counters (see recent TEST superlosses in Eso). I also think the jump gates are broken. Your listing off a dozen things that dont really matter when it comes to cloaky camping. And honestly i think im one of the few who CAN effectively make the point because test has very limited cloaky camping in our space atm and do alot of it to others.
---
For is folks who are at work, what happened? Sounds like there was a timer or a battle?
---
They were not your friends.Better to discover it sooner then later
---
Nah you see it's only good memes when NC does not defend Astras against 3 goon fleets
---
you know salt is bad for you,right?
---
Farm more.
---
In all honesty, what you should do is run missions until you can afford to fit one of the starter/alpha fit T1 incursion battleships that Warp to Me suggests. Join their fleets and in a few days you'll have enough to plex your account and have access to train into actual mining ships.
---
Then join a nullsec corp/alliance to further your mining career
---
Then you can use the gas and do reactions. I’ve never done reactions but I huff gas and sell my gas to corpmates that do. I know they make good money from it supposedly

it would be fairer if you could use bubbles and no CONCORD presence in Invaded systems

There have now been 6 different invasion center systems, at the pace the community in game is moving it is almost to farming point already but we have yet to see any tier 2 or 3 invasions so who knows what's to come

Having the same issue, just lost a ship mid-fight because of it :-/ also can't log back in for several minutes after disconnect. I ran a traceroute and it's timing out about 6 jumps out from me.
---
2 modes for the ship, similar to tactical destroyers, one mode makes the industrial utility highslots into tractor beams, the other mode makes them salvagers
---
Could be people cargo scanning your ship.

---
&gt; there is no counter to cloaky camping
---
The way the attacking side sees it, cloaky camping is *the* counter to local/intel/umbrella. 
---
The alternative is active hunting. 
---
If they active hunt, they first fall in local which means any non-sieged and attentive person is already safe. 
---
Second, they fall in your intel nertwork which means anyone 4-5 jumps over is already safe. 
---
Third, you get the opportunity to ping/form for them before they attack, which means you can project your already superior forces by using mechanics that truly have no other counter than having a bigger capital force. So unless the attacker has a bigger force logged in atm, anyone who manages to get tackled also is saved if they light a cyno.
---
&gt; Supercap umbrellas have plenty of counters (see recent TEST superlosses in Eso).
---
The only conventional counter to the umbrella is having a bigger online force. That's very rare against people with a good umbrella (like yourself) and flat out not possible against people with the best umbrella (Delve). By making krab safety about numbers, you just cause most farmers and economic activity to flock under the same region, which is the phenomenon we are experiencing today. These people have the privilege to grow exponentially, while others stagnate, just because they already have the largest umbrella. Which means we need more counters than merely just "get your own supers". AFK cloaking actually provides a way to circumvent the umbrella, by preinhibbing ships. That's how we killed lots of supers and titans in Delve recently.
---
&gt; Your listing off a dozen things that dont really matter when it comes to cloaky camping.
---
This is an overall a perspective failure which not only you but most other CSM and CCP often fall victim to. All whaling mechanics are connected, just like all sov mechanics are. You yourself talk about how CCP promised Aegis mechanics but only developed citadels and most other sov mechanics didn't follow that promise. That's what happens when you change one mechanic without taking its place in the whole system in the account. The same happened during citadel/FW interaction.
---
At the end of the day afk camping is not a matter of play/counterplay. It's a matter of its place in the whole system. It's a mechanic that makes nullsec less safe. So it's a matter of how the balance of safety in nullsec currently is. Currently nullsec loses less than 5% of all farm in the form of lost PvE ships, and that number is getting lower by the time. In umbrella regions it hit to 3%. This all means a huge lack of content for people who hunt these ships. Particularly because people flock in huge empires/umbrellas like yours. You as the nullseccer don't owe content to the rest of the game. But it's best for CCP to design a game which more null PvE capitals die for optimal amount people -hunters and PvE'ers alike- to keep playing. Until null loses 15% of all income as content, it will keep being "too safe". Until the day it stops being too safe, there is no reason to make it further safe. In the day where it all is balanced, we can talk about removing this mechanic which we also recognize to be ingenious.
---
Thanks for another edition guys, I was looking forward to see this one o7
---
Damn that looks good!
---
&gt; That person was, sadly, not you.
---
Minor fix.
---
What a comeback,your mother must be proud
---
Want me to wake up yours and ask about yourself?
---
Yeah I was the same. It’s like he had a stroke half way through typing.
---
1 super is nothing against that many dreads.Also he was probably multiboxing
---
I get that. My question is why that super couldn't kill at least one of them.
---
Silence, Eve has no sound.
---
he melted fast?
---
I found a low power Athanor in a WH and dropped it to structure. I left a covops in the system for 2d while the timer ticked down, and found a new route to the hole for my small fleet when it came out to repair.
---
I was met with a large fleet of Oracles from some other corp that beat me there.
---
They invited me to help kill it. I trusted them and shot the structure with them, then they showed me a faster route home and invited me to join their corp.
---
Pleasant experience, A+++ would randomly trust WH people again.
---
Thanks for the LUMEN mention! Keep up the great work ARC!
---
When spinning fails start insulting with weak mother jokes.Works every time haha
---
The only thing getting sprinkled with white is your mom.
---
Look who’s spinning now tho.
---
if you want to be an inept farming mongo just like in the other games you play: good news - 97% of the eve playerbase does just that and there are plenty of ways to do so as an alpha.
---
moon mining and industry aren´t one of those ways though.
---
*Narrator: It took one year.*
---
Step one, acquire 500 PLEX and two Multipilot training certificates, or buy the Star pack, one month sub, 500 plex, and 2x MPTC, it’s a good deal and is essentially 4 months of subscription, this will allow you to train all three characters under your account at once, and they will all be omega, but you can only log into one at a time.
---
Step two, Plex your account, activate the MPTCs and follow this guide to train them up [Eve-U PI Alt Plan](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Creating_a_Planetary_Interaction_Alt), with the remaining time I recomend you train them to have basic Caldari Battlecruiser with basic combat and cloaking skills so you can use them as cannon fodder in a bad situation.
---
Step three, join a null or C3/C4 wormhole corp, set up your PI, I had to watch hours of YouTube, pick through reddit and forums, and learn some Excel, you should research what is involved, but you should be able to make 500-800m a month a toon, calling it passive is a joke, but it makes ISK for your and your corp.
---
Step three alternate, join a hi-sec corp and do hi-sec factory PI, you fly around buying the cheapest PI mats you can find,  and process them to higher tier and sell them. You will have to math hard and fork over billions in ISK to get going, you will be paying around 10% tax to some big corp that owns the commodity office.
---
Step 4, mine a lot, you have about 500m ISK to get to PLEXing you account after PI is in full swing, so mine the best you can, just crunch the isk/hr, mining HS veldspar in a barge is a lot less profitable than a Venture/Prospect huffing some gas in null or a WH, or a Endurance getting shattered WH ice.
---
Step six, you like doing all this?
---
Buy another Star Pack and do it all with a second toon, you will more than double your PI profit, because you can produce more complex commodities with 30 planets under your control.
---
And now you have a Omega alt to scout, mine or shoot with.
---
Final thoughts, I enjoy the challenge setting this all up and keeping it running.
---
I was able to do it in a few months after I formed my own idea of what I wanted to do in Eve, I started with a 15m skill point toon with some major skill holes from 10 years ago, starting with a Alpha toon will be harder, I also produce a lot on income through WH ratting and exploration of whereever the wormholes take me. And the skills to do all that came with time, anthough once you are purposeful with your training you can get what you want in defined time frame.
---
This is what Eve is to me, I fly with a chill small group of people in a corp that I like and helps its members, we got folks with 5 accounts, alpha explorers, cloaky T3C hunters, and folk that fly nothing but Orca and Exhumers.
---
I’m happy to defend our system when we are threatened.
---
Some people make billions never undocking with the market, some people are bloodthirsty pirates,  I’m somewhere inbetween and try to be the “good guy” but  you will get ganked, you will be undercut on the market, you will be scammed, you will be stolen from, and you will have to respond in kind to get what you want.
---
Hope this helps.
---
I applaud you for this effort and appreciate all you do for the game.   At the end of the day many may vote blocs but we won’t be able to say we didn’t know what we were getting.
---
super glad that you left. things are way more chill without you.
---
Im sorry, but we could honestly care less who dies in delve at this time. We warned imperium members. You stay in delve at your own risk. You undock and die. You deserved it. Every death is a darwinism award winner

Most these fights are nothing special to look at. A crap ton of drones, bubbles galore, and a bunch of dots barely recognizable as subcaps. The two super fleets didnt meet
---
CCP provides ticks for incursions and K-space ratting, whereas in wormhole space there aren't any ticks just loot and salvage. They seem to be transferring the latter model to invasions. This makes sense from a balance perspective, I suppose, although the major difference in wormhole space is that you can defend yourself from ninjas when they are ballsy enough to present themselves on grid. 
---
Hisec invasions lack this crucial mechanic, which means you're fielding fleets for potentially no payoff whatsoever. I'm all for experiencing new content for the thrill of it, but without some kind of reward for the time spent players aren't going to invest themselves long term. Of course, this is only Chapter 1. Perhaps CCP has something planned that will improve the payout in the future, or at least move incursions into areas of K-space where ninjas can be properly dealt with.
---
It helped a lot, really.
---
Thanks

Thank you! It's a shame Reddit as a whole doesn't like CSM content, but I think it's important to do :)

---
Can't wait until I have enough skills to go kill unsuspecting VNIs.
---
No that's bad, mine in the Venture, it has a 5000m3 ore hold, fits 2 lasers, and will mine many times more in the same amount of time it'll take a Nereus to fill up once.
---
Fastest news in the west. \*fingerguns.\*
---
I got the Venture but I thought it couldn't store that amount of ores because I was looking at its cargo capacity, not its ore hold..
---
I miss running into Sodium Oxide frequently throughout jspace ever since I moved out ... :(
---
Out of hundreds of thousands of players, no-one is confused but you.
---
That is not someone else's failure.
---
Spend some of that time not gaming and $15 won't unreasonably stretch your entertainment budget for the month.
---
I will surely message you! 
---
Yeah the cargo hold is irrelevant on mining ships, the ore hold is where everything you mine will go. Make sure to look up a good fit for the Venture, you'll want 2 mining lasers in the highs, a mining laser upgrade in the low, and some tank modules in the mids. You should be able to mine 5000m3 every 25-30min iirc, a Nereus would take over an hour to do that.

MER begs to differ.

Mining Laser Upgrades are alpha useable, they're a low slot module. Run your career agents, you'll get given 2 Venture in them. Plus a bunch of other stuff.
---
Poor crab
---
I like you.
---
See my comment above :)
---
I probably got confused in the market then, thought Laser Upgrades were Omega only.
---
And also forgot that I actually got a Venture by ending the Business Agent's career!
---
10/10
---
Good luck on this new shenanigans!
---
 MER is no fucking Bible, mate.
---
So, I saw a comment in this sub about a misconception people (like me) have about "needing billions to pvp."
---
Could someone expand on that?  How much does one need to start learning to PvP?  Can one sustain a PvP toon while learning?  Is it a FW focus with LP bing the income source until one is able to YOLO and win while solo?
---
4 years ago, my goal to L2PvP was to find 10 bill and have an alt join RvB and learn, for context.  Obviously, never happened, hence the questions.
---
I’ll see, I honesty started this as a shitposting account and might want to keep it unassociated, but you can PM your name and I might make us bump into each other.
---
Yeah you'll get one in the Industry career as well. Also make sure to look up the alliance CODE., and set their standing to red, then you'll see them in local and can avoid them, never pay for their "mining permits" they're the Eve mafia who blow up miners in highsec and then try to get them to pay for "protection".

I will try that too, how to set an alliance as red tho?

Search the alliance name, in this case CODE. (The . is part of the name), view its info and there's an option in the info window to set standing. Choose either of the red colors in this case.

Yeah, you worded it better than I could. If it's all part of a bigger thing, fine, but it makes running it initially suck, and if people didn't like it before they most likely aint going to pick it back up again, especially with how many things there are to do in eve.
---
Thank you!
---
Bob u still out here disconnecting
---
I have a job that pays me extremely well, but requires long hours. Yes, I buy PLEX to fund my PvP, fuck spending what little time I have ratting or mining.
---
To be honest, one of the things that keeps me as a new player out of eve is a lack of direction and feeling of aimlessness in the game. If invasions spawned in a system and made it feel like there was something actually going on that'd 100% have improved shit for me
---
When you get into eve you know its going to be hardcore, its the *lack* of anything going on that's the problem
---
It's almost like that wasn't a mathematical fact.

Ree fuck facts or something like that?

Now you are assuming a random krab in a super decides the attitude towards killboards in the imperiums.
---
Naturally these random guys have more say in this than the leadership who says "If you are in this for the killboards, you are in the wrong place"
---
this belongs in /r/choosingbeggars
---
So now you saying some goons are “random krabs”, and it is OTHER goons that dont care about killboards?

Salvage mechanic is neet.. But trash for HS. I tried in a dissie and died on my first gate cuz guess what ccp didnt update overviews.. Thx guys.
---
 The t2 trig parts shouldnt come from the invasion as salvage.. Like who thought this was a good idea.. They should be dropped as bpcs in abyss space. Makes WAY more sense as were in a sense invading their space right you know WHERE THEY BUILD SHIT.. The worst part about all of this tho is the entire lack of payouts.. I understand the isk flow is to high atm but jesus ccp.. Youve made content for no payoff. Wtfs the point.. Do they clear low power structures? Have we lost any yet? Lol like whats the point of this content if we dont get paid.. Are theses ccps way of making space janitors lol 
---
This expansion has honestly been the worst one ive been a part of. 0 rewards for absurdly difficult fights. At least abyss space they got mostly right.. *except the fucking DEATH WALL*

These trig invasions better escalate to something else soon.. Cuz these are dumb. But if its only phase 1 then fine.. But fucking TELL US CCP.. Jesus.

Sounds about right with the random krabs.
---
But sure do try to tell yourself how we are demoralised by killboards and what not.
---
Literally do anything else.. If alphas had access to the gear your requesting the game would break rather rapidly.. Its already alts online. If pi and heavy mining were allowed by alphas everyone.. And I mean EVERYONE would have 10-15 alts for it. Minimum. So yess its free to play. But its also a premium game or freemeum if you will as you can access it and play for free but need a premium acc to get the ful use of it. Would you prefer a 60$ buy in? I know eve wouldnt have survived under that model.
---
So tip. Learn The game before you bitch on reddit about it being restrictive and deceptive.

why am i keeping all these corpses then?

You said “us”, which implied that included ALL goons. Not my fault how you phrase it.

Have the freighter start warp. Then web it. Practice will teach you how far along in warp you should be before webbing
---
1) press warp on freighter
---
2) when freighter is moving at 10% speed web it (technically 7.5%)
---
3) repeat
---
Either way would work.
---
The point is that a ship must be at or above 75% of its max speed in order to warp. Webs reduce the max speed, but they do not reduce the rate of acceleration.
---
So when you put webs on the Freighter, it will continue to accelerate towards max just as fast as before. But now "max" is drastically reduced, which means hitting 75% of "max" is much easier.
---
I cargoscanned him before, he didn't have anything but T3s and 2 T2s....
---
Caps can for sure.
---
Supers..maybe.
---
Lol, he couldn’t even clear a t3 in that.. I wonder if he dced
---
You must be at 75% of your max velocity to warp.  If you web before the freighter is in motion, you will accelerate to that 75% at the same rate as non-webbed freighter - the numbers will just be lower.
---
If you start accelerating normally, then web the freighter - the 75% suddenly becomes the lower number, but you retain the existing accelration, immediately jumping to warp.
---
So step by step:
---
Start warp on freighter.  Allow X time to build momentum, where X is equal to 75% of what the max will be once it's webbed.  Web freighter.  Follow freighter into warp so you can get to the next system before freighter and repeat.
---
If you want this to be max efficiency, swap out the DD for a rapier - range on the webs matters far more than amount of webbing, especially with the webs you're using.  Even with a rapier, you'll occasionally have to burn towards the freighter when you get popped out too far apart.
---
exactly.
---
I wouldn't expect to see T2 BPCs drop from anything. I would expect people to get the Data cores, and go research the T2 BPC off of an existing T1 BPC.
---
Yes they can. It's pretty cancerous to move them any kind of distance via gates though.
---
Should’ve been tiny rorqual and tiny pontifex, would’ve actually made sense that way
---
Never went of a fleet with this guy as I hate going around roaming killing ratters.   This AAR makes me thankful I didn't.  I can appreciate a good AAR from the enemies side but this is just a saltmine of epic proportions.  Glad you won the fight, hopefully you will learn from this guy as to how to write a proper AAR,  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bv4uij/aar\_battle\_of\_whjca\_sh1\_ihub/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bv4uij/aar_battle_of_whjca_sh1_ihub/)

He found his undock button, failed miserably to find the self destruct button.
---
No heat sinks. You need like 3 to do enough dps to make it through sites in decent time. If he got a pair of bs spawns he probably couldnt kill them fast enough :P
---
What I want is a decent fight outside of eutz or autz.  Defense is ridiculous strong right now in determining when the fight is gonna be.  At least in the old system each had some amount of say over when the fight was gonna happen, this autz timer fights is just bullshit.
---
I wanna know what happened to Tribal.
---
Last I played, 4 years ago, they were the group that nabbed my attention.  IIRC, they were one of the few that didn't doughnut.  Don't see anything about them anymore.  Would have joined them if I had time/knew what NS was all about.
---
If you are wondering why, [here is what nabbed me.](https://youtu.be/1IXMHVnp3mM)
---
still proud of that kill
---
naglfar still #1 dread re
---
Cause it starts with what, 300dps with occult?
---
still a better love story than titanic
---
&gt; Webs reduce the max speed, but they do not reduce the rate of acceleration.
---
Webs absolutely reduce the rate of acceleration.  Webbing a stationary target will require the same time to warp as an unwebbed target - it will just cover less ground during that time.
---
I own one, but it is for sale, don't have time or patience for it hehe. But most folks in GSF can afford one. They are not that expensive.

Nah, mate, most folks cant afford one. Even if they are not that expensive. Maybe if they sold most of their assets, sure. The average goon, the average dude in ANY alliance, cant play the game as much as you think, maybe a few hours a week. They have no way to make that isk unless they plex themselves into a super. And most people dont do that.
---
Huh.  That change seems....special.
---
This. Every move I make I feel like there is multiple cloaky t3s ready to ruin my day.
---
I think this is it, but I scanned the ships hanging around the station myself and my scanner’s both cargo and module found no scanner’s(not to mention when I am scanning, it dose not make that sound)...Also the sound happens  immediately upon undock.  I should be invulnerable to targeting soon...Maybe police scanning for contraband??
---
This was the most common reply in the help chats : )
---
It's affected a lot less than you think. It was part of their attempt to make nullsec 'smaller' and was couple with what they called jump fatigue, which was also cancerous.
---
They've nerfed jump fatigue enough to the point where its almost non-existent. So people just jump caps everywhere again, its just a little slower.
---
Definitely not that scrubbing sound...
---
I made a friend this week. We PVPed together and blew stuff up. Who is this friend you ask? An abandoned Warrior II drone I found in a wormhole.

I don't really imagine it affects much, I'm just struggling to think of a scenario where you'd want to gate a super instead of cyno it.
---
Like, I don't mind the change - but I'm confused on who the change was meant to appease.
---
there is something dark and chaotic about non goons using SA emotes 
---
i like it
---
Jump fatigue was that terrible. They wanted to stop fleets teleporting across eve in 30 minutes. So they did it in the most CCP way possible. Make everything about moving capitals a mind numbingly terrible experience.
---
Supers and titans can as well.
---
I use this myself. Very comfortable.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jH6MiKxKYU
---
Imagine bragging about one win while you're losing everything you have lmao
---
You want to gate it when you have a large regional gate go across.
---
Example: Deklein to Branch. You can either go a long way around through Venal, or take the gate between UJY and Y-19 and save a tonne of time, fuel, and fatigue.
---
Even the average goon isn't as dumb as the guy(s) who ate shit in that BR.
---
There's still a lot of decent propaganda being made (Olmeca's vid was really well done), but you're right in that there's been less of it. Comments per day and posts per day appear to have decreased from 2018 levels, though I do wish there was a better site to visualize this than subredditstats. 
---
I hypothesize that people are more likely to make propaganda if they're participants in a smaller content, since they feel more attached even if it might be less popular. While that's possibly testable through reddit scraping or something I haven't bothered to do that. Time is isk and all that.
---
Buddy, it's been weeks and you're still mad as hell. You can tone down the damage control; it's just a game. You get so defensive over every goon comment lmao. He didn't say the kills didn't count, he just said they were retards, which is of course true.
---
Kinda true and kinda not. In order to enable several playstyles that people do enjoy, null blocs need to hold space. Holding that space can often involve to some really boring and tedious tasks. People still need to show up for those tasks even if they suck to actually do.
---
Blame CCP for linking fun content to boring and unpleasant setup tasks that mandate unironic internal propaganda departments to keep people doing them.
---
Lol. That made me lol.

Interestingly, saying 'spodbrain is contagious' is not actually a personalised insult in Eve, it appears to be a fact. You were actually personally insulting first by calling mineus64 a moron.
---
Instead of posting a thread whining about how you can't play a game for free when there is a subscription barrier in place and you simply didn't do research of what that barrier entails probably shows you aren't suited to Eve anyway. It's so complicated you NEED to be able to research what you want to do or you won't last.

In Eve uni I kept myself afloat with incursions and some null/WH PI for light frigate PvP and the odd inty/ceptor every now and then. But I'd definitely say that I'd expect getting a good combat ship works wonders, like a VNI, Gila, or T3C to rat in. T3Cs (and to some extent the stratios but it doesn't have bubble immunity for null) are particularly neat because cloaking lets you get around non-Concord space (ie LS/NS) safely enough for better sites.
---
As for your other questions:
---
1. I can't really put a figure on how much but a competent meta fit frigate can cost about 3m each. Once you figure out the obvious traps and lose your first few, you then move up to a slightly less disposable T2 fitting for about 10m. I'd say that you can learn the basics of LS fighting for less than 100m. 
---
2. You can, especially if you live in HS and can just bug out when you need to make money.
---
3. I've heard running plexes is dreadfully boring but I suppose it could work. Sounds like something you'd really want to multibox rather than do on a main though. Never run FW L4s so I can't speak to those though. I don't expect selling to be an issue, Datacores are still popular enough. I'd probably just rat or mission or something instead but that's just my preference and what I expect to be more fun for my playtime. 
---
I personally believe RvB and similar NPSI corps are more made up of retired null vets than newbs but it's probably better to ask someone with more experience! However I can say Spectre fleet is stronger than ever, and you're free to opt into those fleets whenever you like to get into some action without putting everything on the line like in a 1v1 and having to do your own dscanning. Anyway, best of luck out there!
---
To answer the unasked question, those 2-3 seconds are more then enough to be ganked.

It is a WH'ers dream.
---
A booshing ship that can slaughter whatever it booshed.
---
Thanks. Are the datacores dropped by invasion only or sites as well?
---
I think the ones that come to mind are the ones that boost shield and armour HP and repair/boost-amount. Most match up with standard skillbooks, so if you search Repair Systems there's a corresponding implant. 
---
The numbers correspond to the slot and the strength. First number is the slot, and the effect strength goes at the end. Each comes at several % grades, usually 2/4/6 if I recall correctly, which are the ones you can get from LP Shops.
---
Finally a friendly reminder to swap clones at a friendly citadel clonebay (Upwells have no clone swap timers) before you head into combatant regions of space like NS! Hope some of that helps.
---
No bots in Delve, duh.

I am unironically pumped for the future FW this Summer and beyond.

---
I think there's an autoconfiguration button below the dropdowns, I'd probably write down your old settings and then set it to minimise memory for a laptop, because their HDDs and RAM tend to age poorly. I think that'll reduce textures when zoomed out.
---
Shaders would then be the next step, to reduce GPU/CPU strain. My laptop is so dust clogged that I tend to run it on full potato to avoid overheating though :(
---
Not really to be honest. Fights going down, ops better than structure bashes, and pretty fireworks in the form of explosions on the homefront. Lol

Shaders definitely make things look like washed potatoes sadly, *but I need those frames for moar navigation APMs!*

Yeah I think end of 2018 they opened alphas up to T1 BS hulls and mods, with T2 small and medium weapons and including faction hulls. It's a great flexibility change!
---
Why don't u try and solve ur problem and not complain about a mechanic that is in the game for some time (... and generates respectable profession).
---
What u can do:
---
1. fleet up a salvager friend/alt, rep him, boost him, broadcast targets so he can be 1st to the wreck;
---
2. shoot the wrecks;
---
3. gank the salvager, prolly some catalysts will be enough;
---
4. wardec the salvager and make his life miserable for the next few weeks (in-game);
---
5. uninstall game

Goddamn this is a pretty game. I also know how hard it is to get shots like this even with all these tools. Great work!
---
Yeah, Dodixie and Rens are definitely less stocked. There's a nice EVE Mogul Sotiyo in Botane but that only really works if you have your own BPs. I think the upwell changes have actually centralised things near Jita because now everyone can find a good nearby manufacturing system (instead of relying on a couple high activity ones). TEST in particular has a **full set of complexes in Perimeter** with some nice buffs to all points of industry, which seems like a massive draw too.
---
It honestly seems like the best way to get goods down there (if you can't manufacture any basic parts) is by Blockade Runner. I've since moved to Amarr for many reasons including HS size for incursions, exploration/wormholes, and easy access to southern null. Kinda a drag, especially as I have yet to gain L4 standings there and I still miss Syndicate, but there's definitely more content to be had there.

Ships in Eve are very versatile, and even if a ship isn’t necessarily bonuses to something, you can still make it work.

We do, but the dread and super are the same guy. Like I said, maybe there's more context that makes it clear that this dude was trying to get people killed. But without that context, it just looks like a dude yoloing a super.

They drop from Zorya rats.  They go for over 100 mill each.  Also, you'll need the new Triglavian skills as well.

Good thread although it *somehow* seems to load at a post for one corp in particular :p
---
My recommendation would be to do DED-sites and get loot from them. It’s not quite farming but it is similar in the fact that you would be collecting modules and items that a lot of players need. You could also salvage the wrecks and sell that too.
---
I still can't get over the fact that the Nyx had a 2.7 billion ISK SKIN, but a 2 million ISK clone clone flying it.

Slightly off topic, but I never see anyone in the C1s (N110 hs static) I tend to hang out in, and I never see hole campers/gankers about, which has confused me. 
---
I'm in AUTZ so that's definitely a factor, it's usually quiet everywhere. But it it also because the exiting K162s end up in quiet backwater systems and HS pockets? When I go *into a C1* with the entrance appearing a few jumps out of a HS market hub I definitely see a few explorers, but so far none of them have tried to gank me. I get the creeps whenever I go through a C5 because I expect wingspan to appear out of nowhere based on what other people have told me... but that hasn't matched up with my experience so far in my time zone, everything has been quite quiet :/

Bingo is not the context we are looking for. He told you he was yoloing a super and dread. I assume he paid for them, I assume you didnt SRP them. Let him play the game he wants to play. Dont want to risk your ships to save him, then dont. However to kick a player because he didnt play the game in an "elite" way, is why goons are rolfstomping your ass. Get reked kid.
---
Slightly off topic, but I never see anyone in the C1s (N110 hs static) I tend to hang out in, and I never see hole campers/gankers about, which has confused me. Could I ask you about some other "danger" factors compared to the other ones you already talked about? 
---
I kind of expect C1s to be quiet in general simply because they don't have permanent connecting statics like C2s and the sites are generally fairly meagre, so one part might just be the fact that they're like pocket systems off the main path of dedicated hunters, and waiting around wouldn't beworth the meagre T2 equipment I'd drop.

Not on our pilot clones. But why would we not have them on our more 'normal' bodies?
---
Right, I get that, and I 100% agree with kicking people that do that. I'm just pointing out that, as an outsider that only has a battle report and the super pilot saying "I'm gating a dread to M-O with a cyno fitted" for context, it doesnt look like an awox. It looks like a dude being dumb.
---
I want there to be more to the story, because I wouldn't expect Horde to kick people for yoloing their supers. But since I don't have access to anything internal (no really, unlike apparently half this subreddit I actually don't have an alt in Horde) I only know what I've been shown.

They aren't allowed to use the undock button. He ruined the narrative that they are unable to find it.
---
Get into a fleet with your web alt, with the webber in a command position. Then using the webber, fleet warp your freighter. Then apply the webs. Immediately after.
---
The only time you have to wait after doing the fleet warp before applying webs is if your freighter is using bulkheads.
---
Lack of exciting clashes leads to no motivation and inspiration to post good porpaganda.  No surprise here.
---
There's a huge difference between yoloing a super in search of a gud fite and intentionally feeding one to the enemy you know is nearby while in an allies staging system, dieing, then coming back in another dread and shooting at allies. The first gets a facepalm, the latter gets a boot.

That's fair.
---
First one is mine, come ganke me :P
---
Wat. There's never been a mention of capsuleers without junk and I would love to see the source backing your claim. Do go into character creation and see what the male pilots are packing. I'm sure there are some with more exotic body modifications (also among mortal population, see The Burning Life), but other than the neural interface in the back of the head and a skull full of implants, there's really no reason to do anything fancy to your fleshbag.
---
ATM No from what i undeerstand.   
---
But hopefully in future chapters this might become a thing.
---
I've been out of the game for a while, so someone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but...
---
NC/PL threw \~60 ships into defending against goons, and didn't break a single one of them?  Not ONE?  Am I reading that right?
---
Hey dude. For what it's worth I found the second dread myself right as you posted this (I came back to post it and saw this comment), and immediately understood what happened and why the dude got kicked. But had I not found it, I'd probably still think you guys kicked him for feeding rather than awoxing, and since this is pretty deep in a comment chain, I'd imagine a lot of people won't see it. I just edited my original call-out post with the context.
---
Anyway, sorry for immediately assuming the worst, and I look forward to blowing you guys up (and getting blown up) in the future!
---
And where can you get those Zorya’s rats, please ? I’ve only seen one Zorya’s Leshak on DSCAN once in a Foothold system, but even tho I warped around I didn’t spotted it on my Overview...
---
Right in time for AIDER to leave FEDUP. Kinda cool actually, timing wise.
---
Why snow mountain in font... You live in beautiful place !
---
IKU-WHAT?
---
That's pretty much my exact setup at the moment and I run 7 eve clients pretty well, with the new 64bit client it runs even better being able to chug more than 4 gb of memory
---
Yoy may not like it but this is what peak performance looks like
---
Where do these drop from? Or were they only dropping during some event, but these ones have no expiration date compared to the others, for some reason.
---
I mean, 125 is a decent price for a second gen i7 and some extras, you could use the extra 4-500 on a better gpu
---
Now we wait for the day TIDI is less
---
Well I didn't make it easy for you... All good.
---
Atta boy!
---
Normal invasion rats can drop them too. I have seen that happen.
---
Yes it does, whatever is on Spotify at the time.
---
The official explanation is that wrecks are trash and cleaning trash isn't stealing. The real reason is, CCP want salvaging to remain a valid profession and you should HTFU.
---
Dont forget t1 battlecrusiers and t1 Battleships.
---
Excuse me why is there so many people from Alberta in EVE
---
Good info!  When I'm not so drunk, I'll read again!
---
I have an alt  intended for RvB, but RP gall, so we'll see where that goes.
---
Been mainly a PvEr, l4s exploration etc, so it is something that interests me.  Fly safe!
---
I'ma pass out now...
---
I got 3 last night from a single Damavik! Can confirm.
---
How does that math work
---
Sodium cloride you mean ?
---
Everyone knows 37 is the absolute minimum to operate in J-space, don't listen to these people.
---
you can run it in kinakka now
---
Love it
---
Don't be afraid to ask other people if you are confused about something. But be careful about asking for direct help.
---
 [https://www.thealphasguide.com](https://www.thealphasguide.com/)   
---
Yeah the character creation has always impressed me. Sadly we don't interact much with our characters as you would in other games.
---
Welcome to Eve. Always double check before you buy something (right station, lowest price) easy to over pay or buy something and not find it in your inventory if you don't watch closely. If you buy something and it doesn't show in your inventory then it is at a different station, you can find it by clicking the neocom menu in the top left and finding "Assets".
---
Any icons in that menu can be dragged to that sidebar for easy access.
---
Good luck with your adventure.
---
Just jumped into lowsec exploration.
---
So far...
---
Need cargo scanner.
---
Drone sites - cool
---
Heavy Missile Turret - Bad
---
That's almost exactly the case, except with rating.  (Cash payouts from shooting NPCs).
---
I have a feeling thats because most of the propaganda is shit!
---
Kicking a player because he did something stupid and died is something only Horde do? To be fair I recall someone getting kicked for dying in Delve not long ago. Even if we talk about how we’ll never kick for thst, just laugh of their stupidity..
---
Well its also quite... well its not really good is it?
---
Maby its just my taste thats weird?
---
Do we know what stuff drops from trig rats ? Any modules?
---
I felt the same when I found out that the whole mining path was locked apart from the venture.
---
What I did though was using the venture I got 2 million then bought a tayra transport ship. Using that I trader from regions to regions and now in 2 days I have gotten over 30 million.
---
Welcome to EVE :) 
---
Google eve university and get reading. You have a metric fuckton of learning ahead of you, if you don't wanna get shafted at every corner
---
Your reward for the previous mission were the items you need to upgrade. Just install those. I'm not sure if they go into your corgo if they they go into your redemption que. In game press alt+y and see if they are in there.
---
Vexor ratting with faction drones is a good alpha way to make isk.
---
Welcome to Eve Online! 
---
What's your ingame name?
---
This makes me moist...
---
They used to drop in Abyssal sites, now bpcs drop instead
---
Their manufacture uses a T2 module as part of its construction needs; so supply levels will probably drop for a little while.
---
Veles Radiation Sinks and Zorya's modules were added with EVE Online : Invasions, and since it hasn't been a week, those modules aren't yet on the market (or are, but have ridiculously high prices, cf. Ikitursa). I'd say wait a bit, when the market finally stabilize you'll be able to buy them off Jita.
---
So far, Zorya's ships have been spotted in Foothold systems (maybe in Adjacent and Perimeter systems too, however I can't confirm it). They've been dropping Triglavian Datacores, which are required to Invent the blueprints for the Nergal, Draugur and Ikitursa. However, since Zorya's modules are classified as officer's modules, I suppose they'll be dropping from those ships, when Invasions reach higher levels, or in the next chapters.
---
Concerning Veles Radiation Sinks, I suppose you can get their blueprint from Abyssal Deadspace, as with Faction Disintegrators.
---
Hope this help!
---
It means snuffed out is around the corner..
---
I'm glad Shoot First. kicked some serious ass tonight.
---
Killed a few zoryas in adjacent systems, hard as fuck to catch though, they seem to like bouncing around alot.
---
What's his name?
---
Mostly meta crap loot, but alot of survey data, few datacores and skillbooks, seems to be random. The zoryas also drop mutaplasmids.
---
I use 4 webs to get mine into warp, the lower the amount of webs you use the longer you'll have to wait before webbing. Rapiers and Lokis (with the correct subsystem) have extended web range. Alternatively you can use a frigate alt then warp to fleet member to land on to of your cloaked freighter and then web him off once you've initiated warp.
---
Nah, Hedliner's not that much of a jerk.
---
Read that books. Gallente navy dude gets a piece of nice ass in zero-g
---
It's back now
---
Best ship name ever
---
poorman
---
You're generally an arrogant ass, but this is an idea I can get behind. Honestly someone shoot me, but Omeca for CSM...
---
This might be a shock but l didn't even notice it l don't spend all day on r/eve l only check in 1 or 2 times per day the only reason l reply half the time is because it pops up on my phone. Once l log out of my eve client l don't sit on my seat waiting for a ping or sit in jabba or discord or mumble all day that's not how l play eve.
---
But you can call me a idiot all you like but if l don't see a BR lm not going to know about it and .... there just space pixels so its not the end of the world in my eyes
---
Every Imperium member runs double plex tanks, damn near unbreakable. You heard it here first.
---
Karma Fleet and Test's Brand New Bros as well!
---
The headset isn't the bottleneck, it's the hardware to control the headset that holds back a wider audience
---
Use soap water. The soap sticks to the fine hairs on the bee, holding the water over where they breathe on their sides. 
---
Also. Goons are unwashed heathens, so soap water helps with that too
---
If it says 0 damage does that mean he ran out of time?
---
Looks like you got some dope mountains outside that window too
---
Spin spin sugar
---
This is good.
---
awoxing?
---
Neocom on right side. Only way to play EVE
---
You say that, but....
---
😂  with all the shot going on, I’ve thought about resubbing. Maybe this will be a good time to break myself of my old carebear ways.
---
Let's find out together :)
---
If you don't gate supers what even are you doing.
---
Welcome !
---
Anchor a mobile depot. Or a MTU. I bet that's the sound you are looking for
---
You will be killed and lose ships.  Be prepared and then reship and get back out there.  If you can do that then you can play long term.
---
Imagine being salty about someone's story of pressing f1 to blow up pixels
---
This is 3 hrs later? Or it appears to be sorry if reading it wrong Im wondering if he lashed out after being abused/threatened
---
Helpful hint, make sure you do your duel request first. Quite embarrasing when your webbing frigate gets Concorded. Not that this happened to me, not at all! :shifty eyes:
---
Remember to flag your webber exempt from fleet warp.
---
Well, fuck you, buddy! The only reason I never upgraded into 32:9 was because of the low vertical resolution. Why would you hurt me like this :(
---
I guess if you throw it
---
Well you see son, when a mommy Nergla and a daddy Nergal love each other very much...
---
It happens when papa Veles sinks his disintegrator into mommy Zorya.
---
The #newbie-help channel on [the Discord server](http://koahi.co/eve) has a good amount of information + people that will answer questions, if you need help at some point
---
Enjoy!
---
Plexing your account wont be viable for a long while. Plex has been spiking because turbo nerds boxing 10 accounts suck it all up. 
---
I dont recommend it, but just play the sub fee and spend extra isk on skill injectors to get baseline skills faster
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skill_Hardwiring has a decent list, the one linked by CMvan46 is just all the pirate implants, not very useful
---
He didn't awox till several hours after he lost the dread and nyx I'd love to know what you guys did to drive him to be so upset he felt the need to blow up his own Corp mates
---
At least you didn't get your JF concorded...
---
How tall are you?
---
He literally jumped the nyx when the fleet was on field... It was just a suicide....
---
Nice video. Nice landscape.
---
In the meanwhile a few jumps away part of your fleet was being murdered. Just saying...
---
&gt;Well when your corp
---
Implying the entirety of j space isn't filled with alcoholics, drug fiends, sodomizers, and all other forms of degenerates.
---
2 m, and I weigh 145 kg. That's 6'8 and 300 lbs in freedom units. I'm taller than Brisc Rubal and Elo Knight.
---
You have my vote

Fingers crossed! VR is so immersive already, but the low Res gets to you pretty quickly

Elite pvp (cocksuckers) shitposters bragging about killing miners.  You must be so period of yourselves.
---
tried it yet?
---
I used to be armoured, now I just look like a waxwork that some one left in front of the fireplace. 
---
feels like i brought a ship on contract and some one has swapped out the 1600mm plate with a 400.
---
They can also use t2 ammo. And have longer optimal range and are better then tech 2 weapon in every way.
---
From that perspective, it was visually stimulating. Gameplaywise, not so
---
I'm pretty sure they should be reward of clearing second and final stages of Triglavian invasions
---
Since so far we have only seen the first stage,  it's unlikely anyone in TQ have gotten their hands on one of those modules yet
---
I could confirm after dozens of Zorya Leshak kills that they **currently** don't drop those things
---
i think we're gonna need to overheat our frenship this weekend lads
---
Every single idiot who krabs during full deployment needs to be killed. Really, you are doing the Imperium a favor. 
---
Maybe hit Fountain too? It could use some house keeping.
---
Buy shit in jita with an alt. Put up public courier contract to the galmil staging. Put in a shitty 100K isk per jump and see it at destination in no time.
---
planned obsolescence is a thing with Samsung, I've had 2 monitors go out, both within 2 weeks of the end of the 2 year warranty.  the last a high end wide curved monitor. must something with number 2.

You are wrong and the guy you responded to is dead on correct. Back when eve was subscription only it had time limited trial periods. They wanted people to try it, get hooked, and subscribe. Over the years those trial periods kept getting longer and longer and longer. Then one day they mentioned in a dev blog a future plan to release an non time limited trial, the trial could be played basically forever. When they actually released it they rebranded, hyped it to hell, and started calling eve free to play.
---
the rookie help channel is a very nice place and if you ask a good question someone might just give you iskies for being excited about the game.
---
just dont beg or post sale contracts. if you do that no one will answer your questions. the corp recruitment channel has a lot of spam and scammers. its probably not the best place to find a corp
---
epiq video of a huge blob killing a solo suicide nyx in tyool2k19
---
Yeah, that "fact" sounds more than a little BS.
---
Tenal apparently also not :p
---
That is exactly the point with this screen. It's awesome for office multitasking as well. The software that ships with it, allows so many different configurations for how to split the screen in parts that suits you.
---
 Norway

You wormholes have no sense of humour 😉

Different country. Different continent as well. 😊 Norway

It's not even funny though.

See?

Yes it can. Ran it with a 1060ti for months.

It's a terrible, low-quality meme.

You're a terrible, low-quality meme.

Welcome to eve! Ask other players for advice but trust no one. 
---
Block scam spammers in Jita
---
Don't ignore PvP gameplay. It is by far the most engaging activity in eve. Best done with some space friends. Content creators keep eve alive. 
---
Get out of Hisec asap! Whether it's wormholes faction war or nullsec empires the best player communities are not in high security space. Keep looking until you find a community that fits you.

Hehe. Not the best day. Still a good result overall.

---
&gt;Like the botter has any fucking leverage lmao
---
a subscription for one... and oh boy are CCP hungry for some cash money...
---
Just a stupid fuck tbh, he jumped his nyx in to save his dread, then got abused / so upset about it he lost anouther dread trying to awox blues
---
You initiate warp on your freighter, wait for it to reach &gt;7.5% speed and then hit it with the web.
---
Everything about this - the needless pettiness, the badly cropped screenshot, the impulse to post both of the above to social media - all of it is exactly what I expect when I see people with characters named things like "Supercool" or "Zach Azzkick"
---
That's just uncle Joe, he likes to sniff hair and play eve, ain't no harm in that yo.
---
it is pretty epic. i agree.
---
loll
---
Is this like gsf internal propaganda or something
---
I'm the dead Gnosis...
---
I'm working towards a promotion, looking good so far
---
it got worse when he made that shitty pro NC. one around the time where the north got their shit kicked in one of the super max hurf fights last year
---
He deleted and ran, so he must have decided this thread was less than supercool.
---
Bee Boop Beep
---
Well, I thought I was in good humor of grief of my first time being killed. Then you said that and I thought maybe since you thought I was SuperCool - that it came across wrong. 
---
SuperCool killed me, he is the bitch. Bad humor I guess.
---
how did his dread get tackled in the first place?
---
I'll demonstrate by linking you the zkillboard page of a good buddy of mine: https://zkillboard.com/character/96042010/
---
The most expensive ship you'll find him in is a Sabre, but he sticks almost religiously to T1 frigates and destroyers, which means he only has to make money once in a blue moon to sustain his lifestyle. You could earn, say, 20M ISK and have enough to buy any of the fits he uses. Or, you could de-bling the fit and buy 10 of them. I'd suggest the second option for a beginner.
---
They were given away for a eve fest iirc
---
Yes, we would like to shower you with free isk &gt;:)
---
Is this Facebook?
---
It would be possible to build a table of items you stock/want stocked.
---
Then pulling the region order book, filter for the station id.
---
Check the current orders of that station for desired stock level and you will get your output of yes/no for is it stocked or not.
---
There is a picture in the other thread of him saying he is gating it but he has a cyno
---
The zorya is the officer mod, so it'll either drop as a bpc or drop as a module from zorya, being a group activity it'll be interesting to see how they do loot seperation
---
Yes.
---
I’m not in the least bit worried about the quality of propaganda in EVE. I’ve seen some pretty basic ones, I’ve seen awesome ones. It won’t stop any time soon.
---
As the original plan seemed to be that concord wouldn't intervene in invasion systems, it would make sense if the shit high sec salvaging mechanics got overlooked
---
You are ruining their incel experience.
---
Noone in goons should be bragging about random super kills. You are literaly pissing away ISK and time to entertain the minority of your alliance.
---
Imagine the delve hunters would be so cocky everytime they kill a group of rorqs/super

Out of interest, if you gained say two or three times the monthly pap requirement, is there any bonus given by corp or alliance?  Sounds like it’s a good way to incentivize and reward participation that goes above and beyond 🤭
---
Awesome fights man :)
---
Nah y'all are demoralized by your inability to krab during the deployment.
---
Maybe CCP hasnt cared about Lore in a long time and didnt want to start doing it now
---
Depends... Are you my boy fiddling uncle?
---
wow... i guess this where your rorq's then :) iam sry mate
---
I love how the cam keeps going back to SH1 like, are they going to do anything to save him?
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/kPA9IcW
---
Literally unplayable!
---
We don't need to imagine it, we see every ship kill from delve posted here for exactly that reason.. And pissing away isk?  A wars a war we dont play eve to hide in stations
---
oh no! not the strategically important rorquals of strategic value!
---
Wait, you're recruiting him to the wrong half.
---
Omg nerf vigil pls Ubi!!! One shot guns shouldn't be in this game an he can DISAPEAR from CAMS!!! Who thought it was a good idea!?
---
good job . keep it up
---
They probably wont
---
Meta guns? Did CCP kill the trig sites BPC drop value :D
---
&gt;  My comments mostly center around the fact that there is no counter to cloaky camping. You can try to bait and kill and thats about it. But since your opponent isn't actually at the keyboard your literally trying to bait nothing. The effects of forces coming into play are not the same as the effects of uncounterable nuisances.
---
If they aren't at their keyboard, then they aren't a threat to you. If they are at their keyboard and kill an AFK ratter or miner, then it's on the ratter/miner. If both players are at their keyboard, there's potential for content.
---
I know this is hard for you to imagine, but players actually enjoy content in this video game.
---
dead game
---
Nice. I should be able to tank a freaking grenade at this point then.
---
I just started pvping this week after a lot of theorycrafting and skill training. After joining caldari and checking out the militia zkillboard, i was surprised to see RvB doing some damage out in these systems. I've been hearing about them for a while and knew it would be a great place to find content.
---
It's only been two days now but both days were packed with learning from fighting and even a class today from one of the leaders on weapon types and how to optimally fit ships. I'm having a blast and made it on my first kill mail. 
---
The best thing about faction warfare for me, is the way it generates isk. I used to sit around in high sec blue ice belts without using boosts and by myself. The corp i used to be in was more into moon mining. Sure, i could have trained those skills and joined them close to the home system. But mining was just a pass time while skills trained, I figured i was making enough money to fit the t2 and specialized gear i was speccing into. Now that I'm able to fit what i figured was necessary for novice outpost 1v1, I checked out a lot of systems to see what was hot and got in a few brawls. 
---
I didn't know it was such a good money maker until two days ago though. Soon after my first assist we held down an outpost in an active system and i got a notification from the state protectorate that i was awarded over 10,000 LP for one cap. Holy crap, that was more money than i made ice mining and i wasn't sitting around doing boring repetitive slave work!
---
So i guess TL:DR - The same week I decide to join the militia, RvB is relocating to do the same thing. They're patient teachers and we go out and blow things up every day... and it's beating the hell out of ratting or mining. PvP is insanely fun.
---
The guy that got kicked from Goons for yoloing supers was given 2 hours to move his shit, that's bullshit and completely out of line. He was losing his own ships, go on the goon forums and look at half the posts about him. People are so butthurt you'd think he was blowing up their ships
---
Ask and the badposter shall arrive!
---
Explain to me how it's a trick? Do you think as a free account you should be able to have access to everything omega accounts do? Alpha is a trial, and that's exactly what you get.
---
100 billion... holy shit
---
You just jet can mine. Each can will hold 27km3, by the time you fill that up you'll be able to drop another. Just collect the cans every hour in a hauler. No need for an MTU
---
If you're having range issues and can't fly a Rapier. Try a Vigil Fleet Issue with 4 webs...web your freighter instantly after it initiates warp, and you should have a base of 19k with t2 weba...further for faction of course...
---
&gt;triglavians invade KNOWN space 
---
     
---
what would happen if they popped into a wormhole? would they just advance their incursion to max level bc noone will be there to contest it?
---
Yes ninja salvaging should give suspect timer. But if you think the rats aren't shooting the ninja salvagers you are mistaken.
---
Don't you laugh at me child . . .
---
No sound in space 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Non RMT botters get several warnings before they get banned. Their leverage is that they play the game &amp; may also sub on top of their botting.
---
CCP has a zero tolerance for RMT not botting. If botting was zero tolerance and CCP decided to all accounnt perma ban everyone ever previously warned for botting there would instantly be a lot of holes overnight in nullsec including in upper leaderships.
---
This might be a minority interest but it costs almost nothing for CCP to get it right, and it looks like a good point.
---
&gt;I got killmails
---
This is everything that is wrong with Eve.
---
Look at what I wrote in a secondary response to mineus64 and you will understand..
---
Never a better time then now.
---
it's a quick 4 min video with comms and chill music, where's the bragging? If the delve hunters upload quality videos I'd watch those aswell.
---
Without radiation sinks it would actually be more painful to kill a room of frigates than the battleships.
---
Yo I don't mean to be rude but lmao imagine making such a lamebrain comment about someone's idea of fun in an internet spaceship game.
---
First candidate in a while that seems to be truly concerned about new player retention and doesn't just want to buff krabbing in their space while hiding behind the "it's going to benefit the newcomers"-excuse. You'll definitely be on my list.
---
Thank you for the vote of confidence
---
That is possible but not in any way evidenced by what happened in Jita.
---
There was no malice against the posters idea of fun...just the reward for blobbing.
---
Lore nerd. Instant upvote.

You're wrong. Sound exists even in space. But you can't hear it. Because there are no molecules/particles that sound can travel through. I mean they are there but not so compressed enough. Here an example that each planet makes own sound.  [https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/features/halloween\_sounds.html](https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/features/halloween_sounds.html)
---
but don't you see all the lore blurbs some intern is writing up once a month ??!?!?!?!
---
Fleet fight notification submitted, see you there!
---
Get a paper route or walk some dogs.
---
Won't do that

https://i.imgur.com/eYIzIZ1.png
---
l had no idea you could web a freighter to force it into warp faster that's a neat trick
---
Yeah I've seen that but those are radio waves, which are by definition light waves (or photons),they don't need a medium to travel in and vibrate transversally. Sound waves are longitudinal waves and do need a medium to travel in so there is no 'sound' in space, as it is a void, but since both are waves in nature after all you can convert these radio waves into sound, but they're not really sound
---
didnt skill hindsight V like you did
---
Fights like this should happen more often. I was just about to logoff before you guys undocked because I though it will be a uncontested reinforce once again.
---
Dread broadcast were hard to follow on our side too, especially with how fast they died
---
i like videos with comms

Join Theran Alliance, they treated me well and they're one of the little guys when it comes to alliances.

You need to kill like 5 of em already to get close to even ...😂🤣

Snuff here.
---
Joe Custer, King of Bashes, First of His Name, decided he wanted a dank brawl for USTZ since this game sucks for USTZ content. 
---
A couple of mids away lay a fortizar that looked interesting, so off we went the other night. Not much happened.
---
The second timer came, Snuff formed, got some AVDOT, a few WANGS that Nate could peel off the Tama gate, and some other lowsec dudes like GoG, and off we went a couple mids away.
---
Enter system, a few of our guys had dc's (seems like a 64bit issue last night) but warped the B52 down off the citadel and started pausing the timer. Not much happened for about 15-20 mins but SFAQL, Siege Green, and their allies undocked and started approaching but stayed in tether. Finally, at the edge of tether, they sieged beam revs and started shooting the B52.
---
Joe warped snuff and co down to zero on the revs, called for an initial wave of dreads to come in and a dank brawl ensued. Both sides traded but the initial momentum was on the side of the snuff dreads and seemed to continue. Init also dropped some dreads in the process.
---
Subs slugged it out for a bit. Predator Elite and DHSJ came in and started shooting Siege Green. CVA also showed up in Munnins but fuck if i know who they were shooting so someone let me know.
---
Finally Snuff was down to just a few triage left, decided we'd gotten a cool fight, traded in our favor, and extracted.
---
GF SF, GF SG, lowsec isn't dead.

That BR is missing a ton of ships on both sides, as per the usual. But fuck you I'm not linking the fleetcom cancer site, do it yourself.

Initial math was like 204 bil losses for SFAQL, SG and like 120ish for Snuff and co.

Vienna is on the way. I wanted better access to Italy and also that nice gold mine. It lead to a whole lot of AE and that was followed by a whole lot of more AE becasue I also ate part of the common wealth. I will probably continue vassal feeding Crimea until russia is dead, and then probably fuck up Aragon with the aid of France and GB who are probably the only thing keeping me alive from the massive coalition that is against me.

If you live in a wormhole and it is filled with old unused POSes, is there any point in blowing them up, or is that just a waste of ammo? It's sort of annoying seeing them on dscan all the time.

Eve naturally works well with those bezels anyway.  They're the borders for my overlay and fleet windows.

If a group who owns an offline POS in your system wishes to return, they can online the POS and have a staging tower in half the time, rather than needing to anchor a new POS.

Can't edit reddit post titles.

This particular ultrawide is literally double the width of 1920 pixels and the physical screen size of two 27" monitors side by side. 
---
It has a function where you can plug two displayports from it to your graphics card and "emulate" dual monitors, but without a bezel in the middle blocking your view.
---
So I get why OP dropped a grand on it.
---
 &gt;how to properly greentext your comments without this happening

thanks dude

You can't complain about multiboxers and endorse injectors at the same time can you?

And now I need an ultra-wide monitor!!!

My apologies to your wallet

We have a large need of rigs in GSF, the real money is in salvaging. New folks following a veteran in a super has made many newbees rich.

Haven't notice them at all.

The guy fed a thanatos earlier in the morning, we killed the bombers who got him but I chewed him out and made sure his directors knew he was an idiot.

Then he gates the Rev around later that day (knowing full well tribute is still bubblefucked) and we hear in command channels he jumped in a nyx.

Consensus was to let him burn

hehe, apologies. I blame the empty wine glass. Hope you don't die from that cancer.

Believe the one I had before this one was a 32" ultra wide. This one is a whole different ballgame.
---
I dont think you understood the message... why you think we let you in already uncontested space. We dont care about tribute... sh1 was saved and 15w retaken today. So courently you did do shit. I think you for sure will kill some more keepstars cause when the gate is open we are chanceless. Courently i would count about 1.5 tril you lost already while the progress is kind a zero. We see how long it takes you to leave smacking home or break through and kill some structures...  have fun as lomg as it will last 😊 our content is courently perfect. I mean we can go whaling all day till you actually really do something and then we come back and fight...
---
So this sparked more interest than i thought it would. Will try to make a few more with a better setup, clean table among other things, and full screen on the monitor as well.

If you want excitement, perhaps the least exciting grinding mechanic in the game (and that's saying something) isn't the right way to go?

---
If you've not done much exploration I definitely recommend trying Amarr HS space. I personally love Domain because it lets me order stuff on the market as I go on testing runs, and it allows me to check up on my market buy orders. In my experience at least trying to stay away from the high traffic of Sinq, because it's really hard to get good sites there (sometimes I've even found it harder to find good ones like 4/10 DEDs there compared to The Forge!) and most of the systems have lots of NPC kill activity on dotlan.

Anyway I'm rambling, hopefully you're not too hungover tomorrow. Take care and fly well o7

I used the 64 bit client for the big IAS timer yesterday and the client was incredibly smooth. The FPS seemed really high as well. I was highly surprised
---
&gt; Nergal is a Mesopotamian name, and every Mesopotamian-named ship thus far in the game have been Creodron (Ishtar, Ishkur). The only exception is the Arazu, which is developed by Duvolle Labs. There has never been any Mesopotamian-named ships developed by Roden Shipyards.
---
So what? The sample size you've got here (Mesopotamian named ships) is literally 5 (and we barely don't get to count Astarte, a Roden ship) and two of them are already not CreoDron, as you said. Also should be noted that the theme with Ishtar and Ishkur is fertility (the whole *mother*ship angle) and it just so happens that fertility is a big deal for Mesopotamia. Then they run out of Mesopotamian mother figures and as a result, you've got Sin and Eos, two CreoDron combat ships without Mesopotamian names.
---
&gt; The ship is an assault class ship. Roden Shipyards has produced zero assault ships that gained widespread popularity across the federation. Creodron released two of them (Ishkur and Ishtar)
---
^citation ^needed
---
&gt; Half of the in-game description of the Nergal is focused on how a drone bay was added to the chassis. Drones are a theme of Creodron, not Roden Shipyards
---
It mostly comes off as "oh we just so happened to find somewhere we could tuck drones in, sorry about Jim tho he done fucked up with something and uh, tell your CreoDron bois to be safe lol" in contrast to CreoDron ships being built around drones.
---
&gt; Related to #3, the Nergal's description states that it borrows design elements from Roden Shipyards' Enyo. The Enyo is known for having an additional turret hardpoint over the Ishkur at the expense of it's drone bay. Here we have the Nergal with only one turret and also with a drone bay. Thematically it doesn't really align.
---
Ishkur has one less turret hardpoint for the existence of its drone bay, you have it backwards there. Majority of assault frigates have 4 hardpoints with afaik Jaguar and Ishkur being the exceptions, with both of them sporting a drone bay. In any case, Nergal having one turret hardpoint isn't notable at all with the whole Triglavian approach to turret. Its gun remains its main selling point, just like Enyo it's a gunboat.

replace  the RPG with  425mm autocannons
---
What I really wanna know is how well did this thread work, in your own opinion?
---
Since no ones said it. I use three webs. I find that optimal. Two dosent always instawarp it. Three is like a 90% chance it will. And four is overkill but if youve got the slots... 
---
That being said use a fleet vigil huggin or loki. Everything else either dosent have the range or is to expensive vs insta blap catalysts. I use to used a curor but its like 50+ m for the hull, fleet vigil does the same for like 10m lol 
---
Huginn and loki have the tank to to generally ignore catalysts unless theres like 10 of them.
---
But pretty much everything else is right. Warp freighter lock web poof. I wait like 2-5 s before webbing so it gets some speed first because webs do effect acceleration. So if you web to soon it takes more than one cycle.
---
Why would they risk losing the war in apex fleet combat when they could just shut down their economy with old money?
---
The main battle is down south.
---
I'm loving every moment of this ❤️😂
---
It all kinda depends. Highsec griefers will sometimes find a hole near jita for example, go in and set up a trap for explorers that come in. These types dont really care what class the wh is as long as it can fit their ships safely. These guys dont care about your t2 drops, they just want easy kills.
---
C5 space is huge, therenare so many of them that you shouldnt really fear finding an occupied one, especially during your TZ. That said, one of the wh memes is that you should always assume that a cloaky proteus is watching everything you do, lol.

Roden have produced Assault ships, the Enyo is one of theirs.
---
CCP do not give a fuck about lore.
---
Prior to new triglavians and SoCT ships, all ship resists were based on lore-based concepts. Each empire primary damage types (eg em/therm amarr, kin/therm caldari), each empire has arch-enemy empire (minmatar-amarr, gallente-caldari). Let's see how resists of amarr ships were defined:
---
- base resists are 0/20/40/50 shield, 50/35/25/10 armor (em/therm/kin/explosive) for all ships
---
- t1 ships: 0/20/40/50 shield, 50/35/25/20 armor (additive 10 armor res vs enemy race main dmg type)
---
- t2 ships: 0/20/70/87.5 shield, 50/35/62.5/80 armor (here we use top tier t2 resists, +75% multiplicative vs primary, +50% multiplicative vs secondary)
---
Other t2/t3 ships get weaker t2 resists; all of them are multiplicative except for the lowest tier (ceptors which get additive 10% armor/shield vs primary damage type).
---
Now, if you check all amarr ships (including zarmazd which was developed by Amarrians) - they follow this pattern. However, all 3 new ships do not. They break this concept several times:
---
- They all have bonuses to thermal and explosive resists, but none of empires who developed these ships have empires withsuch damage type as arch enemy (gallente Nergal should me kin/therm, caldari Ikitursa therm/kin, minmatar Draugur em/therm)
---
- If these ships were developed by triglavian engineers, they should have resist bonuses suitable vs drifter weapons (exp/kin is best vs omnidamage for armor tanking)
---
- amount of therm explosive resistances these ships gain breaks t2 resist conventions (they get amounts different than 75%/50%)
---
If we assume that it's triglavians who developed these ships and that they are the arch nemesis of their own race, trig ships would have the following resists:
---
- t1: 0/20/40/50 shield, 50/45/25/10 armor
---
- t2: 0/80/40/75 shield, 50/86.25/25/55 armor
---
But they have:
---
- t1: 0/20/40/50 shield, 50/35/25/20 armor
---
- t2: 0/50/40/85 shield, 50/75/25/65 armor
---
Which look like arbitrarily assigned values to me.
---
I was in a machariel. I killed 107B worth of shit and lived. Thanks for not making me primary.

Hi there, here is the second episode of my solo pvp adventure in EVE Online. 
---
When fighting in EvE, every fights is an opportunity to learn, even the hardest.
---
I'm making this serie to improve my solo PvP capabilities, so any tips, advice, fits or ISK are welcome.
---
this is a thing with all ships, sometimes gatecamps will web a cruiser to its freedom because they are too dumb to apply point/scram first

Saw that going down on zkill feeds last night, nice fight

Uh, what?

Absolutely not. Rattle is best and other BS are after it. Then T3s, and gila *might* be next.

Why are you so salty?

R Kelly is a singer who once released a song called "I believe I can fly". He's also a serial pedophile. BBC has a good article up (posted yesterday) of his history.

Yep. I was going to buy most of them if they were 55 plex

Now im going to buy exactly zero.

Go fuck yourself CCP if you think thats a reasonable price for those skins.

I was late to the party and jumped in shortly after it was stated all our dreads were down. Undocked my Rev and somehow didn't get shot by the remaining Snuffed dreads while helping clear the grid. It was a hell of a brawl. 
---
I heard lowsec is dead.
---
Not really any good ones that I’ve come across.
---
I’d say you could do Ceptors &amp; VNI hunting, blops with bombers and hunt excavators (bombing), thrashers and just suicide for bling stuff, or LR caracals maybe with a boost Dessie or 2.
---
It’s really difficult to get into FCing and there’s no magic checklist, but you need to be really knowledgable + good with mechanics for people to actually want to fly with you. Also don’t be mean to people even if they’re retarded, people like Vince or Elo or Progod can shout at people cus they’ve proven themselves to be really good (except maybe progod) but for someone starting out you can’t be like that or people won’t go on your fleets.
---
Try to keep fleets short and to the point (about an hour for roams +/- 20m), respect people’s time, and try to go to places with lots of content where people will undock to fight you (and not in titans/supers Goons/Test cancer)
---
I think I heard you get called primary once but you burned out of lock range.

That's my first time reaching absolutism. I find the menus lacking on how to increase it but maybe I haven't found the menu for it yet.

Too bad I just started a war on Tuscany but I also started integrating Georgia and what ever other vassal I had east. i guess I will Roll through Afghanistan and thé others.
---
yeah 250 plex is around £7, if you buy like 15k plex at a time (and who the fuck does that?)
---
guess what i can get for £7 in other games, well lets have a look.
---
elite dangerous, £6 gets you 12 skins (6 skins for 2 ships) and some kind of bobble head. Or for £8 you can get a pack of 18 skins (6 skins for 3 ships). (if you wanna be real fancy you can get a pack of 8 skins AND some extra wingy bits to change the model a little, for £11)
---
so elite dangerous is giving you, what, about 14 or 15 skins for £7 if you math it out?
---
just had a quick look on steam but most games have skins in bundles with premium time etc... either way for your money you get at least 1 skin PLUS a bundle of other goodies.

I'll never understand why people enjoy being part of these bloated nullsec alliances.
---
Potentially. While there are certainly a number of people on reddit who just hate the CSM regardless of who's on it (or, at the minimum, think its useless), i think a bulk of it is just frustration in that a large portion of it is controlled through nullblocs due to their voting power. So, by default, they don't really care about the nullbloc reps, since they are pretty much a shoe-in. 
---
Either way, they're still interesting to have to help people who may still be on the fence about voting. Doesn't really matter if mine suffers the same fate, still good that it was done and to have that info out there.
---
Best way would be to just "do it". Usually, people are always up for forming a fleet if someone volunteers to lead it. Just don't ask for the most expensive toys. Noone minds losing a 6 mil cruiser.
---
When goon kill 1 Nyx they make a video and hard comms. But when goon loose in one week 10+ super, 10+ rorqual, no vid for this... Funny bees \^\^.

I trust not a single person to determine who is a botter in this game.   We do not have the tools necessary to say anything for sure. Only CCP has those, it is the same as in every other game calling people hackers. Do you really know or are you falsely accusing someone.
---
What is the point of this comment? There is nothing actionable here about this its just a salty bitter comment.
---
Ok, I believe people here have anwered you question already... Let me just add that if you want to start Eve, you don't want to if you can't​ pay a subscription for at least 6 months! '-'
---
After this time period you would be able to sustain a character capable of paying for subscription at a respectable time, and still allowing yourself to get your own profit!
---
Without it, you will just burn yourself with the game, it won't be fun!
---
Yes, Eve IS a P2P game!
---
Yes, you were tricked, or you miss understood or whatever! It doesn't matter what you thought, the situation is that and how CCP like to say... Hard the fuck up!
---
Another important thing to keep in mind... You seem to be soft skin, people in Eve tend to talk like truckers, they aren't trying to be bitchs(most aren't), they are just being hard around the edges! 
---
If you do subscribe to Eve, and keep soft, specially if industry job is your thing of choice, you will have to deal daily with "elite" pvpers and even fucking ratters telling you how you are waisting your time every day... I believe that particular bullshit you already experienced in this chat! &gt;.&gt;

A fleet of 200 is not necessarily 200 pros. It's usually a handful of good pilots and a majority of people chilling out. Some of them don't pay great attention and don't move with fleet quickly (catch them off the back). Sometimes people will want to catch up to fun, and you can intercept the pipe between a big blob and their mates trying to get in there.
---
Principles are, set a destination and head there. Don't go too far ahead of the slowest pilot in your group. No-one is any good to you dead, so encourage people to leave field if they think they're likely die. Come back after repairing.
---
Also, if shit looks like it's going bad. It is. Until you know it's not ;)

RPers - how do you get into RP in thus game? Fancied trying it with an alt
---
Hi Mauti, miss you. 
---
Dhsj was 3rd party, shot both of us.
---
So what you’re saying is you’re an entitled little bitch who doesn’t want to work for anything since you won’t take up an easy job to play for entertainment. Got it you dumb lazy bastard.
---
I dont fault the fittings being bad, just bad for the job, A-space requires as much DPS as you can get as your also racing the timer.  Its a good fit if he wanted to go to the PvP arena.
---
EVE is risk. They're simply choosing to play it without the high sec level of safety that's normally there
---
put a backslash before the &gt; like this \\&gt;

reddit ignores formatting shortcuts after backslash, also works if you wanna start a line with a #
---
Dotlan works for ratters kindof but you can see in real time by searching a system and seeing in the ADM value is going up or down over a short period of time, this is especially important for rorq hunting as dotlan doesn’t have industry “ratting” figures.
---
Killing PVE ships is hard though, carriers are impossible to catch unless you awox or they’re literally brain dead, rorqs require a relatively large fleet or supers (if they’re well fit), mining barges only mine on athanors which will fuck your fleet up (and maybe have a rorq with panic anyways), VNIs are half bots, and the other half you need to be very fast to catch (it’s quite a skill in itself)... so you don’t really want to target those imo
---
better to maybe harass people PVEing and trying to get them to fight you, maybe camp a gate that is between a major JB (you c an see enemy JBs on your map) or go to a staging system and start linking the undock button in local idk lol, crashing  a gatecamp works too like the BWF gate in horde staging
---
You have to learn who’s gonna be a total loser and drop 20 caps on your t1 cruiser fleet too, such as snuff in lowsec, goons/test in null, are in my experience the worst offenders.
---
There is definetly a core disagreement between us. You think nullsec is to safe because you view it from the lens of delve. Delve is one region, the other 30 need the balance more
---
I got a curved widescreen but not a super duper one like yours (didn't have them at the time). Nice!

Good idea, shoot the only reason to run the incursions.

Yup was nice seeing a bunch of old faces

&gt; You think nullsec is to safe because you view it from the lens of delve. Delve is one region, the other 30 need the balance more
---
Not really. In fact, statistically speaking, mining in Esoteria is safer than mining in Delve. I don't make these claims merely on my personal experience.[ I collect data on this stuff.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1goutrhQADKczT9MLzA47Crdf3JwsVu5PNDHKN_qIvTs/edit#gid=391531178)
---
if it's anything like how guns work, it'll be 50% effectiveness at 129 km (84+45) and 6.25% effectiveness at 174 km (84+45+45). falloff starts where optimal ends.

Not really the same small scale you might be looking for but gives u an idea of how its all done. And it explains rather well various decision etc.

Also if you look for chessur videos on youtube, he often added videos with comms. And that is small gang pvp at its finest. Here is on example with his commentary but think he has some where you can listen to fleet comms.

The contract deposit was the one which caught off guard in this: https://i.ibb.co/nzrkTbm/bbbbb.png
---
Said while being in a null sec alliance that is safer than high sec and can shoot anyone that comes near him with a super. 
---
You provide no solution to the problem that is acceptable. Having gank catalysts on standby will do nothing. Not everyone has a miniluv alt. They only lose a 10 to 20 mill frigate and can come right back and you lose the salvage which is your only pay. Even if you do gank them, the amount of vultures means you would need more gankers than fleet ships. Ganking them is just not a way to solve the problem. 
---
You can't war dec npc corporations
---
Even with a noctis in fleet the swarm of vultures can still salvage a good amount of wrecks. Even with the noctis on field while you're clearing the rats. 
---
Source: have ran several invasion fleets with 2 noctis on grid. Still lost some wrecks to vultures. We do shoot the flashy yellow fucks though. Killed a cynabal the other day for stealing. 
---
Actual solution, make ninja salvaging go suspect. Then you can shoot them.
---
Hey overworked_dev, I hope you have a wonderful day.

Got gate ganked for the first time by a mach last night. The one second I let my guard down in lowsec, got me right out of the gate. Only other person for like 2 systems atleast too.
---
You get the deposit back once the contract is accepted/declined/expired.
---
Harden the fuck up pussy. You probably studying a useless liberal arts degree. Welcome to eve bitch where everyone is a psychotic murderer.
---
Pretty sure deposits are only for bids but I could be wildly wrong. I dont use the contract system enough. You should get it back after the contract is outbid or you cancel it. 
---
I should have been more clear. It costs 10k to set up a contract. Even if its free for the receiver.

---
This post right here is Millenial spot on.
---
If we run a series of response tests (see all the bot hunting guides) and they all pass, repeatably, no, it's a fuckin bot. Players do not react to being tackled by aligning out, then stopping their ship, then when you remove tackle they do it again. They align, heat AB if they can, maybe drop drones if they have 2 brain cells, and keep doing it. Or they angle to minimize dps and try to fight you. Or they're afk and just keep orbiting the site lol.
---
Bots will just hit the warp command then have it fizzle and stop ship when they get tackled and just sit there. If you remove tackle they'll try to warp again in a few seconds.
---
Then tell us you’re degree so we all can laugh at you. Also for the repressed anger none I just enjoy triggering dumb fucks like you.
---
I've been putting out some videos lately that cover slightly bigger fleets (20-30), which is IMO where cruisers really start to come to life. [Here's the smallest fleet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDFOrheLbHc) I've recorded so far, which uses sniping rail Thoraxes.
---
I'd suggest doing something like Assault Frigates to get your eye in and learn the basics of how to move people around and scout for targets - Almost any home defence fleet is going to be larger than 10 people, so you either need to be ready to fight outnumbered, or be trying to pick off unwary targets, and frigates are much better at that than cruisers - Destroyers also work if you want to be cheaper!

No not at all. I'm incredibly sad for you.
---
So you agree with me. But do not want delve to get any stronger. So screw the other 30 regions. The largest more organized group will always be more efficient. The goal should be to make things easier for the small groups not harder. THAT is why you see the push into massive umbrella blocs. You end up not wanting anything to change so your game style will not be affected, despite your clear strength at adaption you showed in your video.

Wulkans here, I produced and organize different areas of propaganda content for The Imperium.
---
In EVE Online, people think others skills are free. Start paying them for making you content.  This can be done with isk, no differently than FCs are paid to run fleets or individuals paid to do logistics.  You cannot expect someone to spend hours of their time to work on your images and content for free. Or, you can continue to expect low effort paint.exe images and such, because your artists are not being paid. 
---
In regards to people saying content is cringy, you can get out and fuck off you low effort meme edge lord.  If you have some constructive criticism to add, most artists will adopt your ideas, but screaming cringe is useless and you are a useless fuck who produces zero content.

I remember... but that was a long long time ago back before citadels and fozzie sov. Back when it was normal to have 50k online players at any moment. Most of which only play with a few accounts at most each... not dozens. Back then people would roam around looking for random fights with other people.   
---
Eve online is all about balancing play styles. Back then people spent 90% of their time doing PvP and only 10% doing PvE.   
---
Now... its 99% PvE and \~1% PvP.
---
Well go fight....
---
God i miss big blue testicles....
---
Ehhh I doubt there is much room for more fights like this. The amount of isk lost means not that many lowsec groups can commit at that level. Besides the SG/SF coalition and snuff, I don't know any other big low sec blocs that could create fights on this scale.
---
Yeah... The super and skills they were injected with have already been expended into the character and losing the character already negates that, what they'd also probably do is reverse any transactions. So that means if you as a botter transfer 1 trillion isk to Mister X, then Mister X better not spend those 1 trillion because once the transaction is reversed, Mister X won't be able to do ANYTHING that requires ANY ISK until the wallet has gone back into the positive.

"– excerpt from a report for the Federal Navy from Roden Shipyards Precursor Technology Research Group"
---
Each race now has a group for Trig research and development. 
---
The Gallente have Roden Shipyards
---
The Minmatar have Thukker Tribe
---
The Amarr and Caldari both use their respective military.
---
Roden Shipyards is not only the largest ship manufacturer in Gallente but their former CEO, Roden, is the authoritarian president of the Federation. He is well known for being a scoundrel and using this as an opportunity to hand this project over to his company does not seem out of character. Keeping it within Roden also allows groups like the Black Eagles to keep a watchful eye over any Trig developments.
---
Finally, CreoDron doesn't really make ships, they make drones. 
---
"Roden Shipyards is owned by the infamous Jacus Roden, a robber baron and scoundrel if there ever was one. Under his cunning leadership the company has established itself as a leading manufacturer of frigates and shuttles in the Federation. The company also operates a strong R&amp;D division, Roden has been active in hiring the best talents out there, often by prying them from other companies with promises of fame and fortune." 
---
[Source](http://wiki.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?title=Roden_Shipyards)
---
As the largest drone developer and manufacturer in space, CreoDron has a vested interest in drone carriers. While sacrificing relatively little in the way of defensive capability, CreoDron ships can chew their way through surprisingly strong opponents - provided, of course, that the pilot uses top-of-the-line CreoDron drones.

So, I'm a new player, downloaded the game yesterday for free and I absolutely LOVED it so far. I'm currently thinking about buying it, but first of all...
---
I want to try and invest into something less combat-oriented and a little bit more "helpful". I don't know how I can put it in words... Something more support oriented? I noticed that there is a Science attribute, and I wonder if upgrading that will make me able to craft more stuff to help my allies.
---
I'm sorry if I'm not clear enough, I can try and elaborate a little bit more in the comments if needed, but the main question is: If I upgrade the Science attribute, will I be able to be more of a support-oriented player for my allies? If not, what should I be focusing? Is it really necessary to be directly envolved in combat all the time?
---
You have a weird definition of damage control.
---
Play for free? Ha! Nothing is free. You have been tricked. This is how eve ropes you in now.

Glorius Hedliner pinged stuff in SH1. While goons didnt do anything worth the effort he took us on a mysterius route far far away from home.  After several Jumpsgates and Burn from a to b to c to just take another Jumpgate we finaly got into dest. It was called TAIPANLAND according to someone who reponded to my question where the fuck i am. After looking pretty, having some chat and some cans of beer for like an hour and a half  we realised 800 Test dudes will sadly not use the gate next to us and fight. Kind a sad we still traveled anchored some minutes of time around on this gate but except someone already fallen asleep nothing happened. After 15 mins of fixing headliners hardware at home and 25 min's to take one's exams in moving the sleeping NC. Cookymonster to a save place suddenly we started moving.   
---
I was already tired too and thought to myself thank good we travel home. Warping to a titan which should bridge us. What i didnt expect.... the bridge went up, we jumpoed and landed on a gate. With us already some Caps where jumping in. Since iam elite i did what glorious FC told us and didnt agress... we just left those caps where they are and had some bubblers holding em down while we jumped the gate. On the other site also some Caps where floating around and the gate was already bubbeled. We killed a niddy while bruning out of this mess and directly warped to a fort. The  had 10% hull left and kind 20 Caps on it in a bubble. I had to take a sip of my beercan next to me and was smiling cause i realised... okay Killmails inc. The intention was killing whats possible till Test and rest arrive.   
---
Some elite hero sabre pilots  instinctively  burned asap from the fort towards the gate we came and test will come from. Dropping some bubbeles. While we where busy shooting the Fort and maybe one or two other caps randomly landing Hedliner was stating we just kill what we can till their reinforcements land.  And then it began. LOCAL-spike some guys on comms reporting enemy Fleet of eagles and CAPS arrive i started to pray to the LORD pls one more cap to kill till we have to bail.  I was kind a nervus by any second more in the fight and even had to use 2 hands to play eve. After Hedliner confirming to the scout he indeed was born with two functional eyes it happened. About 20 to 30 Test caps landed in one of the bubbeles. since there where a lot of them "unsure here what the command from test was" i guess they didnt warp more shit into this grid before it gets all out of control.  Most Caps at the Fort could safelog in the time or docked up and i dont know .... like basicly most of themn where gone when the fort went poof. 2 or three caps then appeared where to fort was and directly got tackeled by some mighty panda bears  which ofc where there too.   
---
Then we Killed all shit on CAps what was left and forced the one or two eagle fleets of which tryed to free thei brothers and killing our sabre's.
---
After the last ship collapsed we traveled ALL THE FUCKING FAR FAR WAY home and stood down. Since it was the second good fleet at this day after saving private SH1 i may had a wank and went to bed.  
---
Sorry for shitty english but most should be accurate.
---
Aww wormholers are the best (◕‿◕✿)
---
I remember the eve beta and shortly after. Was so much fun, but too many ways to avoid a fight now: citadels, jumping instead of taking gates, bridges, nullification, cloaking etc. Eventually killed pirating for me, which was my favourite.
---
Yes you can still catch some people, but no where near what it once was.
---
So you're now claiming to talk about two things that you know little to nothing about.  Personally I would have stuck with the botting.
---
My ships don't stay around to be collected, I fly them though, have you tried that?
---
At the risk of sounding like a dong dangler, there's still a limit to how much you can yell at people even as a proven FC. There's a line with Elo and if he ever crosses it while singling someone out, he'll apologize for it once the action is winding down and explain what he was actually trying to get across.

If you don't like null just leave! That's what I have done and I haven't looked back.

I wouldn't say they are risk averse, it's just that there's no point to shoot other people other than for the heck of it. Every region/system can support everyone and everything, so why bother?
---
I’m sure new players with plenty of time to play have ample opportunities to make isk, sure.
---
&gt; SRP matters
---
Y'all acting like ships are free around here
---
Or, and hear me out, maybe he knew of the fight when it happened and brought it up later after no one posted an AAR.
---
I feel like this is a paid comment.
---
Eve Glasgow is just some Tennents super in the park
---
A lot of snuffs called goons hateful names before, during and after the thankfully short partnership.
---
&gt; So you agree with me. 
---
In some smaller regions, people tend to stop anomaly farming when afk camped. That's as far as our agreement goes. I don't see less anom farm as a bad thing, including when it occurs in smaller regions. Overfarming of nullsec anomalies is one of the biggest drivers of negative macroeconomic issues in Eve. And I see your proposal as actually creating more gap between large and small regions, by decreasing risk in big regions. Meaning even more motivation for people to move in mega empire space.
---
Removal of afk camping reduces risk in flat out all nullsec. That is true in all mega/medium/small empire space. What you fail to realize is that the risk reduction in mega empire (the negative of your proposal I'm pointing out) space has a more significant effect on the meta than the risk reduction in small alliance space (the positive of the proposal that you underline). Small alliance people who are forced to cease anomaly farming actually have equivalent options. It's not like they multiboxing 15 Rorquals like the inhabitants of mega empire space. They could do exploration before, and particularly now they can do abyssal stuff for income. Meanwhile, the utilization of afk camping in mega empire space allows us to send strong messages such as "PvE titans/supers aren't untouchable". We have proven that concept in just a month of camping in Delve. And now we're about to launch a constant permacamp campaign. 
---
&gt; You end up not wanting anything to change
---
My platform is full of proposals with change. Perhaps the most radical ones. They are just not designed to appease the null empire builder intuition of constantly reducing risk in nullsec. They are designed to make nullsec the high risk and high reward environment it was supposed to be by the very design of this game. Currently it's a travesty less PvE income converts to killmails in nullsec than hisec. You folks have to come to terms with that you're supposed to lose ships during farm regardless of how well you organize your defense. Else all kinds of playstyles fade into the night, leaving only krabs in the game. All in all we recognize afk camping isn't a super smart mechanic. But until other proposals that would increase nullsec risk become true, it's one mechanic that increases risk in nullsec, which is direly needed for this game's economy and ecosystem.

I love how goons welcome every traitor in the game with open arms, but as soon as any one of them turns against them - they immideately become "not that good at all", even if before them leaving everyone thought they were awesome. Goons be goons.

We don't need AARs for goon losses, it's to be expected
---
Based on the cargo I'd assume it died in the first site it was used in
---
Small town on the west coast of Norway. Are there FRAT in IRL neighborhood? :O
---
Great job! People often overlook the power of EWAR ships as solo boats due to their low DPS.
---
I love reading other people’s comments about Eve lore. It’s so complex and I don’t know too much personally, but I’m positively entertained by other people’s knowledge about it.
---
I like it when hy wanto stabs me in my backside.
---
The 1900 update was awesome, and really contributed to the meta in the game. What other game has a weekly newspaper covering meaningful stories?
---
Buuuuut... it's also really heavy on the resources. If you like having those reports then you should help them write them. They'll need sources to give them leads and reporters to follow up and write blurbs.
---
😏
---
The new ships are built with triglavian tech so it makes sense for them to have trig resists.
---
GF, hope everyone had fun.
---
step one of every patch is to go through your main overviews and add the new things that matter. sorry you lost a 5 mill salvage dessie learning that tough lesson.

other than point 4 those are all good. good luck wardeccing an npc corp salvager

What mumble overlay is that? Mine is crap

Gotta love those gas sites with the towers, lost a few ventures to those back in the day
---
….wow that hits the nail on the head thanks for the research and sources.
---
I have a question that maybe you can answer, you and SF been duking it out down in Genesis area and from what I can see they just keep blobbing you with shitty comps and caps, lol armor Rohks. Why did you guy roll over and show your belly at their beck and call for this fight? Political or just a mutual hatred for snuff.
---
What a view behind the screen i would love to live near the mountains :) where are you living?
---
I don't know I haven't been able to play much because of work
---
It's beautiful here. Agree 😊 It is a small town on the west coast of Norway
---
I believe wh classes 1-3 do not have sleepers at their data and relic sites unless that changed.
---
Its always nice to see both sides of the coin.
---
The data/relic sites with a faction pirate name in them do not have sleepers... i.e serpentis, blood raiders, sansha, etc
---
Poor 2 Poor? Free 2 poor?
---
I picked it back up pretty recently. My advice: skill up to destroyers, then do the Blood Stained Stars. It's a really fun if long arc that nets you a good bit of ISK. 
---
Fly safe!

I updated my GPU drivers yesterday, motherboard drivers 2 weeks ago and all the other drivers are up to date for sure as I checked via device manager.
---
However, reinstalling the launcher helped and game works fine without crashing
---
Yep, fixed above. Thanks. Had to look that up as I'm a bit rusty.
---
That's a nice joke I have to admit.
---
Yeah, reinstalling the launcher helped and game runs fine, thanks
---
Yea because a new player buying a few small injectors a month is a much smaller impact on the plex market than your average multi boxing spodbrain
---
"Warp to fort" lied, caps died.
---
Yes clearly, and i have resulted to join their discord recently, but the conflicts i am in is the least interesting for me, i already have informations on those.
---
You are looking for these sites. Pirate faction name is like Ruined Sansha monument, Ruined Serpentis monument etc.
---
Relic sites
---
ruined (pirate faction name) monument
---
ruined (pirate faction name) temple 
---
ruined (pirate faction name) science outpost
---
ruined (pirate faction name) crystal quarry
---
Data sites
---
central (pirate faction name) sparkling transmitter
---
central (pirate faction name) survey site
---
central (pirate faction name) command center
---
central (pirate faction name) data mining site
---
Do data sites In high sec until you figure it out

At the very least, there is only one site that has enemies immediately on grid.

So the wormhole I visited was k162 and the description said 
---
"into unknown parts of space" which according to the [WIKI](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Wormholes#Wormhole_Text) is C1/C2/C3 ... so what am I suppose to stick to then, I am a bit confused? Just high sec? Thats it?
---
Text | Meaning

---|---
---
Unkown | C1/C2/C3

Dangerous Unknown  | C4/C5

Deadly Unknown | C6
---
High Security | High Sec
---
Low Security | Low Sec
---
Null Security | Nullsec
---
It seems i entered the one wormhole k162 that isnt described on the list ... so yeah which ones do I stick to?
---
What was this dude legit thinking anyways? M-O is in direct jump range of goons caps/supers. Like how else could this have gone down?
---
Anybody bigger than me gets my vote.
---
Lmao.
---
I'm not a goon, I was just drunk trying to antagonize an "elite" horse member.
---
But do they have the info?
---
To be fair, I've been giving them less info lately too, so it's not like I get to stand on a pedestal and say this. But if we want more stories we need to give them more leads. The more, and the more detailed, the better.
---
Hey mate where do you FLy now. Long time not seeing each other on grid
---
It was a good time.
---
Seriously PanFam should forget about Tribute and go fuck GoTG and take Branch and Dek about time Sort was removed from this game.  The amount of backstabbing this guy does is unbelievable..
---
Hey imyormom, I hope you have a wonderful day.
---
Ayo, alright bud! I’m semi-afk from the game at the mo, roaming around southern null a bit. Get the feeling I’ll be back in BR before long, or will maybe check out the min/amarr zone.
---
It's just the noise of the space station farting out your ship.
---
Bah I dont care about the ship. Just tried of having to update my OV every damn patch. They should be on by default.
---
Its just a petpeve really.
---
And the shit that has been bought cause of that combo 😂😂
---
Mine changes a lot depending upon what space I’m flying in, but generally looks like verybadateve’s, though I have my anom/sig window and cargo docked in my bottom right chat, and people and places and decan docked together above.
---
Good view as per usual. Thank you for your content Mr Jin. Always informative.
---
You went to the right wormholes. If you didn't find any of the sites like in my post above someone already cleared them all. Keep exploring and you'll find them eventually.
---
You entered the good type of wormholes but did not find the good, empire type of relic/data sites as explained by others; just persevere.
---
Glad to hear you still have 2 functional eyes.
---
Chessur is right up there on a different level imo. I mean he’s stupendously good, it’s like a black art
---
you can offline your mwd if you know you wont need it like with the domi fight to recover your maximum cap which will help you rep more because you'll replenish more cap per tick with a higher pool. the mwd reduces your max cap as a penalty but nit if it's offline
---
Nooo , bads that want to still boson rat don’t count , nor do they get srp.

Let’s not forgot you basically buy a super for nothing . Any dumb ass with an astero could finance one in a month.

It’s a dangerous shark filled game we play
---
2010 wants their memes back.  Actually wait, even they don't want this trash.
---
Where do you think the injectors come from?
---
&gt;The data/relic sites with a faction pirate name in them do not have sleepers
---
Dude! Thanks! I didn't know the one's in holes didn't have sleepers! I wonder how much money I've left floating in space thinking I couldn't mess with ANY w/h relics and datas until I had something heavy like a Strat.
---
Thanks so much! I didnt realize the ones in holes don't have sleepers.
---
TBF 4 fights in 50~ minutes is pretty decent for modern EVE!
---
In low sec is not a gank because they can kill you in low security.  Proper term is gate camped.  
---
If you recover and got back out then all good.  My response was salt of course.  Then I made it high quality salt and grinded missions to be able to do locates, learned how to fight and defend myself.  Got in a corp that war decs a lot.  And hunted my gankers down. Repeatly.  I still smile when I look at my collection of their bodies. .
---
Tridgit arse licking skills have always been 10/10.

No it was genuine , nc. Pl thrive on internal troll and internet spaceship bullying. That’s all they’ve ever done in Eve. Pick a target that can’t win against them and rofl stomp them into the ground for “gudfyts”.
---
Pubstomping a weaker opponent does not make you elite it makes you a coward. 
---
Now call goons cowards.... it would mean admitting that panfam is weaker ;)
---
In a machine that runs this well ? Durr
---
I just started about 2 days ago and I feel honestly the same. I've heard a lot of shit, but the game is beautiful, interesting and fun to play. I stayed up till 6am when I usually go to sleep around 11pm haha.
---
Oh look it's the caveman dude, how's it going? As far as tridgit yes he keeps my asshole super clean 😏

Anchored 4 more forts, 2 got popped 2 successfully anchored, objective achieved, a few caps died.

Find a wormhole. 
---
Go in.
---
Make sure its not wormhole that leads to known space (highsec, lowsec or null). 
---
You are looking pirate name relic sites (so \[Sansha blablabla\] or other pirate faction). 
---
You do not want to data sites, they are not worth your time. 
---
Sites that have pirate faction name in their name like above are all without rats, meaning you just scan and loot cans (works for both data and relic sites). 
---
You want to do relic sites because a.) on average they net 10x more isk and b.) Sansha faction sites have 1 or more cans (depending on level) that can drop intact armor plates, something like up to 20ish of them, per can, with each one being worth \~7 million isk nowdays in Jita. This is your premium. 
---
When you are inside a wormhole make sure its a normal wormhole, so like there isnt a shattered planet with asteroids flying around it, or anything weird like that. 
---
Normal (low level) wormholes have pirate faction sites (ones without rats where you dont have to fight), the high level weird ones do not. So if you go into a shattered WH there could be 30 sites, and you can spend an hour scanning everything, but there wont be any non combat sites. You only go there when you need more connections to other wormholes. 
---
Wormholes are connected like a highway. The first one you go into (especially if you do it from high sec) will probably be completely scanned down with only combat sites and other wormhole connections. This is why you only go into a WH that isnt near death. Go in, scan sites, and if there are no relic sites for you to do, go into some other WH. 
---
Remember to not go more than like 6 WHs deep because well it might get difficult going back home. Once you get off the primary WH highway (entry WHs) there are 100s if not thousands of WHs you can get into which will have plenty of sites and nobody inside. 
---
Once you find a good WH with good connections, you can do 100-200 mil an hour, it all depends on those armor plates.

"Well, shit. That was an expensive one."

And that's what SRP is for.

Join a good corp. If you do something with them where you're likely to lose a ship, they'll reimburse you.

On that matter, I wonder what CODE's SRP policy is. Not that they're a good alliance...

Good wiki, good corp.

how many posts for a single nyx kill by goons while they already lost a fuckton of crabs back home?

[This screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/5fRHcWu.png) was from a little while ago, but I haven't significantly changed anything since then. 
---
The main reason I arrange stuff this way is because in combat for everything except manual piloting it keeps my mouse and attention in the same general area of the screen so I don't need to keep flicking back and forth across my monitor.
---
The main drawback of this particular layout that I've noticed is that the broadcast window is the lone exception to the above-mentioned clustering, which is suboptimal in some cases (particularly when I'm flying logi). I've been meaning to experiment to see if I can find a better layout, but haven't gotten around to it.

This idiot wouldnt have been srped in goons either. Is this babbys first narrative?

Well obviously, when you get to use the ISK you botted for, you've already had the fun that makes it worth your while, right? On the other hand you have money laundering, e.g. botters in corporations that collect taxes from them, botters that "get scammed", botters that jettison high-value equipment in a container at a safespot for a partner to find, botters that "accidentally" fill the wrong market order and so on. All of these things are directly traceable and CCP can and will usually go after the other party in the trade. But that also takes time, and if you manage to bot for 10 bil ISK and then go on a PVP frenzy, you've already had the fun once they nuke your assets.

To interject, if I may. Firstly, thanks for enjoying the stuff we do put out. I enjoy seeing all the positive feedback, makes writing the 1900s that much better. As was alluded to in the comments section, the 1900s are heavy in resources both in time and research and writing and editing and confirmation etc etc. Yes, getting more information is always helpful, so thank you for joining the server! Getting more writers is more helpful.  Even though you are not an active part in the conflict that may interest you, still post about it in #intel, maybe we know someone or someone within our network does and we can tap them to try and find information. 
---
I have always tried to do the best by you guys and give you a good sample of coverage of what is going down across an entire map that has so many unique conflicts going down. The fact we miss things or don't always have room to cover it all is a testament to how awesome y'all are at blowing shit up. We are extremely grateful for what staff we have right now, but fresh blood is always good for rotating people around to manage burnout and just getting new faces introduced. We are an organization that is running on a lot of volunteering and a low budget, so realistically we need sponsors and staff resources to get things both accurately and in a timely manner and pay writers for the countless **hours** of work they are putting into writing their BR's or other writing projects. I know perhaps you don't like some of these other articles, but other people do seem to enjoy reading them and it is solid work. 
---
The main reason for the delay between 1900s was very much due to RL. I was recently let go from my job. It was unexpected and unplanned, so it kinda left me in a weird position. Naturally, RL comes first so I focused on addressing that while maintaining editing other articles and things as they were submitted. Having it go for a month was unplanned, and when I set to write the most recent one, I knew I left it on the light side but that was because there was just so much stuff to write about over the past month that in contemplating what to include or not include in a piece that was already over 2000 words long, I decided in that particular case to just not give a novella for everyone to read and focus on making the next one just be up to date. I hope you understand and I do apologize about the delay.

Its almost like they decided they wanted to put some cool new ships in without having a purpose for them other than raw powercreep :|

You probably entered from a high traffic system, which also means more people will enter whs there, and all the accessible sites were already cleared by some1 before you and no new sites of the desired type spawned yet.

They use the term “carebearing” for jewing and unironically say “toon” when referring to one of their characters. **Generally speaking they are inbred, space hillbilly-gypsies and they are much better at this game than you are.**
---
We of Curse took that to be our credo.
---
SOME don't have sleepers, only the pirate sites that were listed above. They're the same ones you'd find out in null (and maybe lowsec, not sure). If the data or relic site is not a pirate site, it has sleepers in it and will fuck you up. Just thought I'd clear that up.
---
Wow, he thinks so highly of himself, he thinks him quitting means the death of eve.
---
This.. All of this. Only thing I feel like adding is. Dont worry how many whs you enter as long as your in high class space "c1-3" *google the system name* 
---
You can always find your way out easily enough as long as you dont go past c4s the rest c4-5-6 ONLY connect to OTHER whs. Unless you get a random wh. So the wh that is ALWAYS connected in these systems *aka static* will be to ANOTHER wh. These make it hard to get out of without chaining.

no, this  is r/eve not r/mentalhealth. there's a reason those god forsaken b4r posts got banned. this isn't a suitable place for such a discussion, at all, ever.

Would be nice if they actually finished the content before releasing it.  Stage 1 with no rewards for X number of days (weeks?) while hyping it up with the stream event is retarded.  Should have called this "expansion"  EVE:  Anthem

There is indeed a lot of roles in big groups that don't involve shooting guns at people, and many people focus on those jobs to various degrees. The three main in-game career paths that you would call 'support', I guess, are industry, mining and logistics. 
---
Industry is your typical crafting mechanic - you acquire ore, minerals, blueprints and other materials, and construct from them ships, modules and ammunition for your group's war efforts. I have very little experience in this regard, so I can't tell you much, but indeed you would be focusing a lot on science for this purpose, as you need those skills to be able to craft higher level gear, so to speak. However, it would probably be a long while until you can really compete or even compare to the already well-established industrialists in your corporation. 
---
Mining is just what it says - you get out in space and collect ore for your industrialists. Generally you would sell it to them at a rate that benefits both parties compared to selling or buying from a market trade hub. It's a very hands-off gameplay style, and a lot of people find it boring, but it also ends up being one of the most profitable once you can deploy many large ships at the same time and take in huge amounts of ore.
---
The third is logistics or, in other words, moving goods and products between your corporation's home region or staging points and public market hubs such as Jita or Amarr. No matter how robust your industrial infrastructure is, you still end up exporting and importing a lot of stuff as an alliance, and that's where the logistics wing comes in. However, it's incredibly difficult to perform this without access to freighters and jump freighters, the latter having a very long training time. So I don't recommend it as a beginner career if you live in NS or LS. 
---
Many people combine these three occupations to various degrees - some industrialists cover some of their costs by mining, some miners also use jump freighters to transport ore to reprocessing facilities and so on. Either way you end up being useful for your group. 
---
*All that said* - lots of people discover this type of gameplay, and see it as a way to avoid PvP, and see PvP as something to be scared of, or something that takes too much money or skill. Don't be one of those people. PvP is the heart and soul of this game, and not participating in it means you're missing out on a ton of fun. I hope this was somewhat helpful.
---
I'm surprised there are so few TNG fans here

---
Main screen is ultra wide, secondary is regular wide. 
---
Mostly hunting/solo PVP, JF, or blobbing. Setup is different on dedicated capital pilots so I can refit quickly and have more channels open.
---
You can go into industry if you want to build stuff and sell it to your allies. You’ll typically be able to buy materials from allied miners and explorers at below standard prices since it’s much more convenient for them to sell to you than to ship it to hisec and sell. I think most industry (the profitable kind, not just building t1 stuff) requires science V, so you’re not wrong about that. 
---
You can also mine or explore and sell the stuff to alliance buybacks, which offer very good prices and are a whole lot easier than trying to get thousands of m3 of ore to hisec to sell. The industry guys can’t do anything without materials, after all. I’d recommend this route, at least at first, because industry requires a few weeks of training and a lot of capital to reach a level where it’s profitable, so it’s not ideal for a brand new player. 
---
For support in combat, you can fly stuff like fast tackle or logi. Basically either hold enemy ships down to let your allies kill them, or heal your allies to keep them alive despite being shot at. Neither of those have you actually doing much damage yourself but they are still incredibly useful to having a fleet do well.
---
Who is he?
---
When I was in middle school, there were these two mentally handicapped kids that always fought and called eachother "retarded". It was sad to watch then, and it's sad to watch now.
---
In short it doesn't. But it depends on the type of democracy were talking about if you mean a republic (us style "democracy") then that's easier once quarterly you would elect a leadership council and a president or CEO depending on size. They would rule in their respective places without checks so as to stay efficient. 
---
The best system I have seen is a monarchy with an inheritance system. Meaning you have someone who is the end all be all of the corp and that person has advisors. When they burn out or leave the game and or Corp you they then elect an "heir" and if the player base agrees with the decision the heir moves into king role. 
---
Pure democracy is mob rule though and does not work. I have rarely seen voting councils work and I have rarely seen any form of democracy work tbh
---
There was a democratic Corp a while ago but it died. There have also been some communist corps but the only one alive I know of is Evolution. Which is communist more in the sense that one person controls all the assets and decides who gets what than in the sense that everyone owns everything.
---
Someone bringing mental health into internet spaceship keyboard fight is urmmm, not kool.

Joking aside. It’s serious stuff. Trying to abuse it to get yourself white knighted is honestly disgusting. I was genuinely going to enjoy a good day of shit posting here on this thread where all the dudes could let off a little spurge. 
---
Now. The tone is so low I think it’s time to cease the post already. 
---
For anyone who’s been personally effected either directly themselves or with a family member I genuinely apologise that this filth made it on to a troll thread. 
---
TLDR: Mental health is absolutely not a joke, it’s not something to joke about and it’s certainly not something you should try to sly into a reddit shit post. 
---
Again, if it’s offended anyone , please accept my sincerest apologies.
---
You can try, but it's been proven several times that it just doesn't work. You'll set yourself and your friends up for theft and hostile takeover if you do it. One of the most recent examples being Brave Newbies. There's a lot of stuff to read on the EVE media about the failures of BNI while they attempted to have a democracy. They went back to the good ol' dictatorship model and seem to be doing ok nowadays.
---

Yep, I probably shouldshould've cleared up that a direct democracy is not what I'm looking at. My idea is a group of 5 to 10 people on a council with one of those council members becoming CEO every 6 months or year or something like that.
---
The big issue is finding a group of council members who are committed to the idea and will not destroy the Corp.

Fun fight. My insurance ran out 5 minutes before the fight, then when I went to siege my dreads after jumping in I learned 2/3 were out of stront.
---
Has this been filmed so the lucky goon line members who spent the majority of their afternoon bashing an abandoned structure can now watch it on video as well.
---
What a time to be alive.
---
As an amendment to my initial post. I would add that I think what I am looking at would be better described as a sort of Oligarchic Republic. With a council of 5-10 who represent individual groups of the corp.
---
I'll have to look more into Brave Newbies, I've been playing the game off and on for 7 years now so I recognize the name. Thanks for the input!
---
am I just supposed to create alts on a different account entirely? every time I try to join a corp with my pvp alt, they get rejected because my main is in another corp (not a pvp corp, either. a mining/exploration/PI corp). why does everyone require you to leave every other corp with your alts?

What was wrong with my comment?
---
I mean I’m all for people getting out there and working on those PvP skills. But surely at some point this dude should have worked out that maybe capitals aren’t for him.
---
I love how the North is focusing on this relatively minor engagement (considering the size of the forces in play) and spinning it into a complete victory.
---
- y'all lost the objective yesterday 
---
- y'all lost the objective Thursday
---
- basically everyday this week
---
Like, congrats on hazing some caps, but that doesn't change the fact that the south onlined 5 fortizars (two on Friday) and 50 something other structures in FRT space this week.
---
Idk what fate holds for those structures, but objectively the South's invasion of FRT moved forward in a very big way this week.
---
Reddit post for nyx kill . The standards have been lowered i see. Good day sir
---
Nobody wants to be 'the alt corp', most corps will require all of your mains to be in the same corp. Make a new character with no way of tracing it back to you (such as giving it isk).
---
Haha np, now you know and can go cash in!

I like to mix and match. 1 x 34" ultrawide and 4 x 24" 1080 https://imgur.com/GmRaVa4

An old friend of mine, ign Emily Hawthorne, is in your group.
---
Navy Vet myself, thinking of joining you guys.
---
You want your leadership structure as small and efficient as possible unless you have a corp of a couple hundred already you want 3 to 4 max. Have your general Corp membership elect them and understand you will lose your Corp within 3 months oligarchy will shift
---
you gotta remember the north has two separate goal posts and they use which ever benefits them more at any given time. Goalpost number 1 "we killed more than you did so only the kill boards matter". Goalpost number 2 "sure we fed a metric fuckton but we stopped your strat objective so we still win." Once you figure this out you can easily understand why even as they are losing a war they will convince themselves you're delusional and its all going their way.
---
Sure, but I’m sure there’s enough people that multibox, not to the extent olmeca does sure, that a lot of those would be greatly appreciated
---
&gt;no vid for this..
---
are you high? There's been at least 3 different video compilations showing supers and rorqs dying in delve the past few weeks.

---
What's your definition of the main battle?
---
I mean I understand it from a time investment but its not like its hard to make isk. But if you prefer pvp then be my guest. 
---
Not everyone can drop 50$ on isk. I can pull a bill a day so its not hard but again if you have like an hour to play its hard enough getting a good fight in that time nvm make isk.
---
Wormholes have an entrance and an exit. A K162 wormhole is the exit side. The other side will be something like for example P060 that describes the wormhole type.
---
the only complaint I ever had about the CRG9 was that it's a big monitor while still being just HD resolution vertically, so anti-aliasing was something that was really apparent, the C49RG90 fixes that but the trade off is it has 7.3m pixels (4k is 8.2m) so you need a 1080ti/2080/2080ti to drive it
---
V-sync is also an issue (not sure if that might just be the frame rate drop or because the frames are crisper) and if you already have a CHG49, enabling the reduced response time now doesn't decrease the brightness
---
I mean is it just me who had to insert mobile depots to or insure 5+ ships? Or go in each ship one by one to equip stuff?
---
CCP are assholes

You can call them coconuts

Disney is already working on a script.

Small med battles 😂🤣😂 you lost like 100 bil wprth stuff pusseyed out till you hab no other choice...

All this in this chat is just embarressing. As long as test members are happy we are too since we want hunt and kill. This is what we do since forever. And i have to thank you. My eve playtime went up about 400% cause tgere is constant stuff to do which i like.

Tell your members whatever you want just dont stoo it pls 😘

Wait what? I've been flying to systems like a chump.

Unacceptable. Why is CCP literally killing the game?

ccp has been teleporting capital bots to Jita for anyone there to kill

he raged quit and is still playing so its a click bait post

Grab an arty rifter and youll have 8 fights in 25 minutes though. Quit being cancer.

I enjoyed it when you could walk into the captains quarters, sit on the couch and watch youtube on the TV in game. I can't remember how it worked or how you did it but I think you needed to fuck with settings, but it was good
---
Dont bait, dont use gay ships , dont gank. If you play like a total faggot people will learn to avoid you and you will get bored. Play nice and dont be a cunt. You will get fights that way.

I still love this one, and I only play Eve 😊

Find the low res more annoying during office work than gaming.

How long do you let it hang before quitting?

Also how’s your internet connection?

Ashterothi with the LORE Source For The Win!!
---
that was fun
---
The lore is wrong because the ship doesn't shoot pestilence and demand to be worshiped as a god of Chaos.
---
You would engage ships out of position or ships too weak to receive remote assistance. Being an invading  fleet your knowledge of who is doing what would be limited, but tactics would remain the same. Also, I imagine having people reverse engineer your technology to be used to fight you would be considered far more threatening than the fleet in-front of you.
---
Ah thanks for the correction. 
---
What do you mean when you say "do locates"? Your comment is inspirational lol.
---
Basicly but thats is for sure not a test only thing... i cant remeber how often Vince, pk or whoever else was like olay do this. The second you clicked warp and cant do shit anymore xou gear on comms.. ahh no dont do this. Right after wtf are you cunts warping. You gonna die. Idiots 😂
---
What the hell?  Is this just a burn or will you try to take and hold something?

People hatin on evan but the guy played on his terms. Don't have to be good to be awesome

The Triglavians are honorable and based on proving and testing. I feel like you are imposing logic to justify your desire.
---

---
Wow how untrue this is.
---
Not the resist stuff, but the not caring about the lore stuff...
---
It honestly wouldn't matter how much time I have, PvE in this game is horrible. Logging in to PvP is the only sane reason to log in.
---
GOG pilot here. Kind of a strange ping for us, but it was fun nonetheless.
---
Thanks to Snuff and WANGS for the invite, and thanks to everyone else for the dank brawl.
---
Oh, Redline is involved, this is going to become a fiery dumpster fire for the Purps.
---
Woosh
---
&gt;If you were an invading army would you attack the people blowing your guys up, or the dudes running around collecting scrap?
---
At the end of the day, it's an opinion, but being an fc you observe things analytically and do whatever you can do either maximize losses or to command victory, to escape with your fleet or hold the line, the way tactics are devised is going to be the same across many different factions, just because of how everything functions, how you conduct warfare is based on your toolset. That much would be the same for anything, anywhere.  
---
Having an opinion isn't the same as twisting logic. If it were, then what you also say is also imposing your own logic on the issue to justify your perspective.

That’s about as official a permission to EVE as it is possible to get in a marital situation.
---
when you get to the high sec gate you have to pay 2200 isk to enter
---
I mean, they did it before too - they just bought characters instead of injectors.
---
I swear, WH- is like your version of Tianenmen Square: Leadership refuses to allow you to acknowledge it.
---
Ehhh to some extent I agree, such as null anoms.. Soo boring but have you done wh stuff or ded sites? 
---
I see your point pvp in eve is unlike anything else the jolt of adrenaline, the shakes, sweats lol no other game has effected me like eve does but I dont think I would feel the same if I just bought my isk. Something about you feel more connected to stuff you build/work for.
---
No. There are rewards.
---
If you gauge success off empty systems then I'm not sure what to tell you.
---
Nah, everyone does that. The biggest lie anybody in Eve will try to sell you is "But *our* shit doesn't stink like that!".
---
\&gt; Gate around rorqual in low sec for 2 hrs

Spectre fleet fcs have being at war with provi for years under htp and purple helmet warriors is this just propaganda to get more numbers to blob provi in eu timezone?

Did this post age well?

My god.... that is *beautiful*.
---
I worked harder for my ingame things than someone who afk grinded ISK in a VNI lol. So yes, you DO feel more connected to stuff you worked for.
---
Awesome!
---
It did indeed. To be fair it was already obvious from the very beginning given the engines on the back of the ship being constructed, but some people still kept on insisting otherwise.
---
The Xordazh is still stationary in-game of course, but it's still technically a ship, as shown in the trailer and as stated in its description as well.
---
NPSI is the only way to fly.

It would be preserved in the vacuum of space

If so, I'm all for it.

So basically, you're trying to throw some public fleets together and, like almost every other public fleet and their mothers, think Provi is easy pickings for that. How amazingly unoriginal.

This sounds utterly pointless, since CVA will just take back the sov later

You are more than welcome and hope you enjoy your time with us.
---
It gets a lot of flak for 2 main reasons IMO:  
---
1) It is a very niche sandbox game that encourages tough love (such as stealing/scamming etc) and whatever ship you are flying is basically your character, which most people can't seem to get over
---
2) CCP (the developer) has a long history of ignoring player feedback and pissing all of their profits into other (failed) projects instead of putting them back into the game.  Each failure generally ends with EVE staff getting fired, and they don't seem to ever learn.
---
That said, the game itself is still pretty good, and the community is amazing.   Actual friendships in EVE are something special, as trust is in short supply, and everyone plays on the same shard.  I've made friends in my 10+ years of playing this game that I've never met in person, but would trust more than 95% of real life friends.  Rivalries in game are VERY real, but 99% of the community is good at keeping such rivalries in game.  Out of game in meetups/when we lose a player to tragedy or suicide, EVE players band together in an amazing community I've never really seen in another game.
---
The gameplay is actually pretty easy, it's just presented in a way with such an information overload that it is very hard to learn.   Finding a good corp/alliance is essential to fully enjoy the game; feel free to ask questions, this community tends to love our newbros and will help out however we can, within reason.
---
the cargo scanning to me is more of a zipper sound, but I could see where someone would say it is a sniffing sound. It could also just be the sound of your ship being squeezed out of the station.
---
And definitely better than just grabbing them in the unsuspecting P
---
/u/Rageliner just goes to these so he can link me awful Minokawa fits.
---
So, when your fleet breaks up, do you shoot each other?
---
Provi gets invaded alot, then CVA comes and cleans up after the attackers quit. Rinse and repeat
---
Lol yes afk vni is the pinical of boring as such so I dont even do it lol. Sb ratting or wh stuff is how I make isk but if your bored of pve youll be bored doing almost any pve, as its all pretty much the same thing. Maybe try burner missions? I hear theyre closer to pvp lol.
---
But I think weve lost the point here lol. I personally dont buy much from ccp even a monthly sub.. Really only dlc packs on sale. Im cheap lol
---
cool i'll share it with the BUSA guys since most of us are prior military...
---
Thank you for your service!
---
Show up where some guy in my corp says, kill some rats with him, get paid after he deals with the loot.
---
Pretty much. Payout pool is growing
---
If you are actually in TRI this is ironic
---
More times than not, democracys, representive democracys and republics all fail fue to either no one being able to agree or internal power struggles. A semi recent (within the last 3 years) example would be FCON's Phoenix Alliance. Which was more of a oligarchy but oh well. Dictatorships work very well in eve, and to my knowledge the best and most successful alliances in history have been dictatorships. Ie. Band of Brothers under Sir Molle.

Goonswarm Federation under The Mittani.

Yes, thank you. But copy the skills from where?

I have the list in an external editor (Notepad++) and need to import that to the game.

I cannot see any way to import from outside the game.
---
Legendary retardation.
---
&gt;500 vs. rest of eve (750)
---
Blobbed, nothing to smug about
---
Well it's what I tell horde to make them feel better...
---
Just a cover up to do htps bidding. Why don't you go burn delve or something.
---
If you prefer a smaller group, theres Eve University,  Signal Cartel, Red vs Blue, and Akadeimia Keipouron. Each has something different to offer. I'm not necessarily thinking that Horde/Karma/Brave etc will be great for someone who isn't overly social. You can get lost in those corps.
---
Just updated the motd and sent some mails out to get people into the channel. 🔥💯
---
So you want to bring the EU into New Eden?
---
No thanks.
---
I've never heard of Akadeimia Keipouron, but the others are probably fine.
---
The issue is that as you get smaller, it gets harder to vet these groups.  And as a new player, you have absolutely no chance to vet them on your own.
---
Once you have more experience, and know what *real* corps have to offer, it's much less dangerous to go out on your own.  It's difficult to go from someone like Brave to a high sec mining slave corp (or equivalent).
---
Eve Online is like jail in a way, find the big group of a-holes, start a fight, start a conversation and become friends, stab each other in the back for a while whilst murdering innocents, get released into a different game entirely, return to eve because your institutionalized and start the process all over again with a fresh character. FML
---
Its literally on the guide mate. Like right fucking there.
---
That was my first week lol
---
So far none of the invasion sites has lasted long enough where this could be possible.
---
Gobbins
---
You do need an external list, if your corp/alliance had doctrine ships they should also have skill queues for them
---
If not, a program like evemon can help build a queue
---
You said you were "incredibly sad" for someone, which is an insult.
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
Isnt gobbins PH?
---
They formed. The other side had 1.5 times more dudes. They fought. They lost.
---
I don't know why I find the idea of an NPSI alliance so funny
---
The main thing that drives social interaction in Eve is the heavy focus on large-scale teamwork. For example, yesterday I was in a fight with 1800 people, this kind of thing can only be coordinated with heavy social interaction and complex leadership structures.
---
EVE definitely has a place for more casual players; each major coalition has at least one Corp which accepts newer or more casual players.
---
I'd suggest starting in a Corp, so spend some time checking out the options available to you. 
---
Want to PvE a lot? You'll probably like The Imperium. 
---
Want to be a hero in the hive of villainy that is nullsec? Look at Provi-bloc. 
---
Want to be PvP heavy and learn from some of the best PvPers in the game? Look at Pandemic Horde or Red vs Blue. 
---
Want to explore the unknown and be a true neutral? Signal Cartel might be for you.
---
Ahh funn. Glad to know were "winning" I guess lol
---
Oh well i didn't mean it like that, i am actually sad because of him feeling the need to troll so hard. Because it typically means they have a bad life. I wish i could do something.

Well,

 I spent several days freaking out that the Ikitursa doesn't have a Caldari logo until Fonsui finally found it, which lead to a lot of looking into it :)
---
There are convicted RMT'rs being teleported by CCP to be killeded with suspect timers.
---
There are also other legitimate high sec capitals. You can have a high sec capital by,
---
A) Creating said capital in high sec prior to their ban &amp; delivering after.
---
B) Having a capital reimbursed in early days, these were sent to your med clone station which could be high sec.
---
C) Having a capital placed into contract when they got moved. When contract expired they went to original location which could be high sec.
---
D)  Being a CCP pet, anything is possible in this game if you pay enough $, suck enough CCP cock or are on really good terms with senior GM's, no joke.

After reading this I felt like asking Provi to rescind my shoot on sight so I could join them.

Copy the list to your computer's clipboard. Ctrl-C on Windows.

It was kind of fun for a little while when i tried it. But after a few groups we had no less than 5 ninja salvagers following our group using combat probes to find us taking all the salvage they could. Since like 75% of the value is in salvage it quickly became not worth it.
---
The main factor that forces player cooperation is the fact that without it the game becomes dull almost straight away
---
I recently started doing more solo stuff because I’m not on that often and doing stuff with other players takes a while, time I don’t really have being a kid because of certain rules at my house
---
Almost as soon as i made that change I stopped playing
---
This post has made me realise that and I’m gonna start playing again
---
Thank you
---
Yep we have suicide gank squad on stand by now for those pesky ninja looters &gt;:D

I don't know Evan he may be a cool dude so v0v but just "playing on his terms" isn't really a reason not to hate him. You could say Erotica 1 or Ginger Magician played on their own terms but that doesn't mean they aren't massive pieces of shit. I'm sure he's nowhere near that bad but playing on your own terms means nothing :|
---
Yes he is ;)
---
Groovy, COGG is recruiting.
---
Best PvPers - Pandemic Horde.... I just fell off my chair laughing...
---
Insert - we form volta, tuskers, etc
---
Do we really need the overblown obviously-contrived justification? I mean, come on, everyone knows the actual reason is "because we wanna and we think it'd be fun". I'd come along anyway (because, yaknow, explosions) but it seems rather silly to go to such lengths to justify a campaign when your target audience is *the people who like pew pew without politics because it's fun*.

---
CCP wants emergent game play and they got it. Doesn't necessarily mean it's fun though.
---
Definately interesting. Not the most profitable but very interesting and fun though
---
Pretty sure he meant for an entry level new player dude. Unless Tuskers is letting in day one players in.

Yes sorry you're right... In that case, Karma fleet?

In Eve Online there is no storyline. There's no path you follow, there's no leveling that requires you to work your way up to harder and harder activities. The game is about doing things in space - mining for resources, blowing up NPCs, blowing up other players, building things, etc. The meta game - the reason we do all those things - is what makes Eve so unique. There is a completely organic meta game that connects most of the big groups of players and it's what drives conflict, peace, production and destruction. 
---
One of the things I like the most about Eve is the economy. Nearly ALL of the items in game - tiny ships, titans (the biggest ships), guns, ammo, modules, space stations - are made by players. There are not a lot of games that do this and the ones that do don't come close to Eve's complexity and depth in this category. It really is an unrivaled system and it's part of what has kept the game going strong for 16 years now. 
---
One of the two videos I like to share with people that are interested in what Eve is about, maybe even trying it, are (watch them in this order):

Watch them in that order! The first is a well made compilation that skims over the high points of the game. Solo play, fleet combat, mining, industry, etc. The second video will give you a taste of some of the extremes you can, and will, eventually run into. You're thrust into a pool with thousands of other human beings so you will get a full spectrum of personalities in your face when you jump in. If you can navigate that, all the better. 
---
Let me be clear, the first video is a marketing video and that will NOT be your experience 24/7. The game is very dry and boring a lot of the time. It is what it is and there's not really any way to sugar coat it. The social aspect of the game is what will make or break your experience. Having fun with a group of other players in between the really exciting times is what makes you stay. 
---
If you try this game out and you take away ONE thing from this entire post, make it this - join an active, supportive player group (corporation/alliance). There are a number of large groups of players that maintain good activity across multiple time zones and it is absolutely critical that you find a group of friends that you can organize with and go have fun. If you go at this on your own you will hate this game and you will quit. The players, good/bad/indifferent, are what make this game fun.
---
most are warped there to die.
---
and a few legitimate ones are left overs from a LONG time ago when caps could highsec.
---
It's probably just what it looks like at face value, casual fun for people who want to play without obligation.
---
legacy vs winterco as per usual

&gt;NPSI trying to take sov even though NPSI members dont care about sov cos they just want pew
---
&gt;NPSI dont have a way to replace losses like an established bloc can
---
&gt;NPSI basically just acting as another batphone for RC for some eutz toasting
---
   
---
&gt;wondering how much maded and friends are being paid to try and take some eutz provi sov
---
Pointing out making people who enjoy a part of the game (but not necessarily all of it) consitenyl have to jump through hoops being a bad thing isn't exactly "whining".
---
The entire point of evei s to be a sandbox, right? So why do some areas of sand that some enjoy need to be hampered more than the others?
---
Freedom Freedom nigga!
---
IMO, the reason EVE encourages such elaborate social structures and cooperation is simply that it gives you the freedom to set as large of goals as you want and then doesn't arbitrarily limit the number of people that can take part. As a result, the bigger your goals, the more useful it is to have many people working towards them, and so the bigger the incentive to work together.
---
It's a very natural and organic sort of thing. It's not that EVE as a game is specifically supporting or incentivizing social organization, it's that EVE is *staying out of the way of the natural human inclination* towards social organization. Humans, as a rule, don't actually need help or encouragement to work together, just a reason to cooperate and an environment where it's possible.
---
Being "worth it" is an individual choice. Some players don't measure their gameplay against other's wallets and killboards. Some just like the challenge of a puzzle with other players being some of the pieces.
---
1) Fleet up with people you trust.
---
2) Shoot all the things.
---
3) Loot all the things.
---
4) Salvage all the things.
---
5) Make the lazy people pay through the nose when you sell all the things.
---
Even without TZ tanking, they still wouldn't.
---
Small groups of newbies literally stand no chance ever against large groups that are given a free reign to attack them at next to no cost. That's been one of the defining issues of wardecs for a while now.
---
Mind you, i don't think this is a bad change. It gives actual wars that can include fighting a goal and clear way to end the war, but that's unfortunately not the majority of wars.
---
Does ninja looting not make you suspect anymore? One dude in a triple point HIC with safeties on spamming point would take care of that
---
That screen space! So much room for actives
---
I use a Tristan or a thorax for learning and the fits like 3M isk. I sustain it through station trading and just (trying to) pvp all day while profiting

For those wondering how this has turned out so far:  [https://br.inyour.space/?s=3759,3770,3773,3756&amp;b=8633953&amp;e=210&amp;t=qrqvrbrqabraabaaaqffqf](https://br.inyour.space/?s=3759,3770,3773,3756&amp;b=8633953&amp;e=210&amp;t=qrqvrbrqabraabaaaqffqf)
---
good advice all around, i just wanted to add: if you roam with a small gang don't do the mistake of waiting for content to come to you. You never abandon initiative - prod the enemy, harass, leave and come back another way etc. 
---
Don t stay 70km off a gate waiting for people to engage you as theyll engage you with the hard counter.
---
We only have Male exotic dancers in supply as this is Delve! Also the 50b is that in Triglavian Salvage, Regular Salvage or T2 Keepstar rig salvage?   We only trust Suitonia.   
---
p.s. WTB Delve mining permit (ochre rule not included)!
---
It's because the game is fucking oppressive mate. 
---
We band together against the mechanics.
---
was a fun fight (like we allways get in provi ♥ ) lets just say we had some "communication problems" in fleet
---
Just another skirmish between Legacy and Frat+Co. Nothing extraordinary
---
Wisdom.
---
Democracy in eve does not work.
---
Letting everyone have an equal voice ensures failure.
---
Just look at FCON.
---
What does work is having one supreme authority and a council of elders that offers their opinions.
---
Or whatever it is that the imperium had.
---
You can't loot but you can salvage without getting flagged.
---
This is very good.
---
In my expirience, most wardeccers are not looking for a fight at all. They just want to jump unprepared ratters and industrials for easy kills and loot. If the defender undocks any kind of real combat ship or fleet, the attacker docks up and hides. 
---
The intent of the rule is to give the defender a method force the attacker to engage in a real fight. If the defender is hopelessly outgunned and outnumbered, by an actual attacking force that will willingly engage, then at least they tried and found themselves beaten. This change only recourse against griefing wardeccers that are too cowardly or actually too weak to fight the defender. And that is ok. 
---
Being unable to do anything at all is what makes players ragequit. Being outgunned or outnumbered lends to an achievable solution for the defender: get more dudes and bigger guns, and more content.
---
You get in on they one and get to play with people from ncpl, all memes aside, its probably the fastest way to learn from some of the best
---
a fight probably
---
Burning delve is hard and results in FCs getting farmed.
---
Thisll end well
---
PHEW must be *really* pissed about those rorqs.
---
This also happened to me not sure why, I deleted the game and redownloaded it and it worked the second time.
---
You have to using the current release beta there hasn't been an official release is ages and it's outdated as hell. Once you have the most recent snapshot run it as admin, run eve as admin, and then magic happens.
---
Edit: also after doing the above turn on the overlay in settings. I shouldn't have to add that but eve players might not figure it out otherwise.
---
&gt;frat can't even post on Reddit you racist
---
  ... Yes they can
---
Join the deployment
---
On what planet do you flex your losses?
---
Well done, CCP. Make it more often.
---
all this noise for some roaming, which you do every single week anyway, and a total of 10b ISK destroyed. that's like 4-5 dreads.
---

---
the biggest thing it does, is make it so not working as a team = insta lose.
---
you quite literally CAN NOT win a fight that isn't one on one without some degree of cooperation with others
---
heck logi can't fight back, it relies on dps.  
---
numbers in EVE = power.    but with those numbers, you need structure, cooperation, and organization to avoid it being a chaotic horde that falls apart
---
Same lol
---
Welcome to Providence! Imperial Dreams is recruiting!
---
What a bunch of weenies. Bring along a salvager. Not an alt, but a real dweeb that is good at collecting cans. High sec ninja salvaging is working perfectly. You want safe salvaging? Go join some massive null-sec alliance where you and your ratting buddies can salvage without consequence. HTFU!
---
Makes my blood pressure tick when people want to change the rules instead of getting better. I just can't grasp the mindset.
---
Nothing better to do
---
And that's the other reason not to make some big silly crusade out of it, because since when has spectre actually been able to pull off the sort of high investment types of fleets that'll be required for this? Every time they take out battleships, capitals, etc, it doesn't exactly end well. Framing it as a content campaign rather than a crusade and coming at it with a "let's see what explosions we can make" attitude rather than preemptively bragging about how much ass you're gonna kick means a lot less egg on everyone's face when stuff like this happens.
---
Here's my [dual screen setup](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3awqxtto1xq7jzu/Screenshot%202019-06-02%2008.01.22.png?dl=0)
---
One good feature I have going for me is if you look at the bottom right you can see just the title bars of my browser. Regardless of the window that has focus my browser will always sit there on top of the active window(without stealing focus). I do this using a program called autohotkeys. If this is something that interests you then follow [this link](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/13784/keep-a-window-on-top-with-a-handy-autohotkey-script/) for a tutorial on setting it up (make sure to change the key binding to toggle autoontop. I use CTR+F12). Minimised but with the ontop toggle active are the programs Pyfa and Shortcircuit).
---
Its a bit bizarre.
---
yes
---
i hope nobody blew him up. the battleship in dehrokh was still there for couple days by now.  ihe has some armor damage and i know when he warps in into belt,when he see me.. all i have to do is to find out where he did go.. 
---
wel  RR mods cant work on those rats.
---
you can rep only  players and some civilian ships in  basic starting  missions...eventually ou can  activae RR mods on  olice ships and concord..  ou can do this on   NPC MINERS  aswell.
---
it will not work on  red ships.  not sure about drones
---
I decided to go solo roaming and they keep pinging for more dudes
---
I was gonna take my condor down there just to check it out, worth the jumps?
---
Ya pup. I remember seeing this when it was first created. I was in my pajamas eating a bowl of cherries.
---
No one cares about provi...
---
spectre flies ragtag harbingers for their weekly saturday ganked welp fleet
---
provibloc flies a proper doctrine muninn fleet
---
provibloc wins
---

---
(I was not there and never fly with spectre, but let's be real - and yes, the "INVADING PROVIDENCE" shit was dumb, but so is this)
---
Hey birthday twin!
---
I went to the Grand Canyon today instead.
---
I sense a lot of sarcasm in this title. I would say he is more like the worst PVPer on EVE history.
---
As in an agent reward? or an npc drop?
---
god forbid people actually PvP in this game, eh Radioactive?
---
It's crazy to see how many vets are in EVE vs any other gaming community I've been a part of. Certainly suits the structure. (Army weekend warrior, checking in.)
---
BLINDING ARCTIC LIGHT  (to the tune of Springsteen's Blinded by the Light)  
---
Old Ned with his sheds got word from Head 'bout some nasties coming his way. 
---
In his hole, dumped his bowl, did his best to hide his roll before he went away. 
---
With a POS and a 'haus feeling kinda boss they started shooting up and reffing his home. 
---
We said "screw that" 'n "Who's that?" "we really nead a diplomat and we're not leavin' Ned on his own".  
---
'Cause we blinded Arctic Light 
---
Got a Rush - Toilet Flush 
---
Good Shit posting through the night 
---
Blinding Arctic Light. 
---
Caps brought down, but they never got fight 'cause we stole them, alright.  
---
Got a fleet, really leet, with a roller really sweet to take away their hole control. 
---
Turned the page, rollin' rage "it was gonna take an age" to find a way inside that hole. 
---
Back on comms, sweaty palms, shaking loose those nervous qualms for the mission we had that night 
---
Pod to base, black your face, get a scanner into space and don't worry about the way back home.  
---
Form a line, hold your time, make the diff'rent seem like kind when you warp to a cloaky safe. 
---
Blitz the dump, hold your stump, starburst cloak and fleetwarp jump and meet at the trophy case. 
---
Grab a cap, bazi snap, sleipnir's guns are gonna tap the baddies that brought them inside
---
 Move the lif, dread's a gift, Oh,these baddies will be miffed as we coasted out their rides. 
---
 'Cause we blinded Arctic Light 
---
Caps brought down, but they never got fight 'cause we stole them, alright  
---
They were blinded  
---
They were blinded . . .
---
Just going by memory, but it's:
---
- E menu.
---
- Business --&gt; Structure browser.
---
- Order by number of jumps (to see the nearest structure)
---
- Turn off all the filters for services except for clone bay.
---
- When you hover your mouse over the clone icon next to the corresponding structure it will tell you the price to install a clone.
---
Implying highsec is a portion of Eve that is hampered with more than others is insane. Sanshas incursions have been a thing for years, do you complain about those, too? Eve is a sandbox full of risk. Risk is the whole point. There are real stakes in Eve. If you think having a modicum of risk temporarily injected into your game ruins it for you, play a different game.
---
Credit card finally maxed.
---
Funny you think it was cash. He stated he used CCs. He's a genius.
---
Agreed. Normally I wouldn't have bothered to post a thread about an engagement like this, but given the whole "war declaration" thing it seemed the thing to do. - But really, I didn't really see anything new happen tonight. Just another Spectre roam, and RC throwing entosis boats away.
---
I don't care what your main language is, and you haven't provided any counter to prove you are not wrong.  Good day.
---
well  in highsec had something to happen  in  these beacon sites like ruined guristas oupost pithered guristas outpost? abandoned mining colony etc.  had encounter with   some cruiser rat...  i mean the landmark sites...  most interessing was npc hauler spawned on top of me when roamed in m  sunesis.. was exploring whole caldari highsec space and found   like 4 or 5 situations where  npc spawn didnt aggro me.
---
About 2 and half hours good internet connection
---
Whut? I'm literally encouraging them to continue. This was quite a fun night, at least for my side of this conflict.
---
That was a lot of Fun.  
---
And about isk losses, since SF salvage evrything, i suppose that the losses are less tan 204. So it should be pretty even in the end.
---
Lmao okay mate.
---
I tried that but it didn’t work
---
a subscription for a free to play game
---
it's literally the definition of a free to play game you retard
---
Not sure if that's meant to be snarky or not. But yes KF would obviously be a good move. If he doesn't want the big bloc life there are lots of other options too.
---
meh
---
Not snarky at all. I like KF
---
This makes me want play EVE.
---
Knowing there is a vet group,  I'm tempted to come back just for the social aspect.
---
The Rogue Consortium getting fucked is the best thing about this to me.
---
I point out your 'no u' reply and your attempt at an intelligent response is to  imply the same of me. I know when it is no longer worth listening to someone. Don't bother replying, you will only manage to look even dumber.
---
&gt;subscription  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;free to play
---
:thinking:
---
No
---
Also kind of touching on the same point, is the Kikimora maybe a better choice? I'm going to be running small fleets and just want to actually useful but boy oh boy am I desperate to try Trig stuff in fleet fights
---
Compared to the others, it's kind of weak, especially its bonuses.
---
Ah shit.
---
You can't imagine the good times i'm having each time you post. Please entertain me.   
---
So i'm gonna be very synthetic, try sping it again :  
---
\- Sure thing Post the Eve mails your CEO's got, I dont see anything wrong about recruitment :) (more important tho do you check on your CEO's eve mails thru ESI ? are they aware ? :D )
---
\- Sure thing, please post the Frat standing sheet, since that's your hopeless argument.  
---
\- Why should I care about what is Dran saying ? :thonking: "Poaching all my corps", name me one corp that got poached ?  
---
\- Noraus never kicked LTRIG from the coalition :) Obvioulsy I didnt yet reach your level of stupidity.   
---
\- I really hope you get better, cuz I can't think of any reasonable way of describing how delusional you are. So now you toasted the whole Tenerifis region ? do you realize people arent stupid, and can simply check on dotlan to see that you never owned shit in Tenerifis ?  
---
I truely believe that Credit Card wont get you as far as you think in this game. You already made half of Eve hate you. what's gonna be your next step ?
---
Freedom Freedom
---
Short answer: No
---
Long answer: its pretty fast, but its starting dps is pretty low and it has poor tank, its best use is as an interim between a ceptor and an AF, but really you would rather have the more specialized ship.
---
Just use a kikimora instead, they are stronk (even with the nerf)
---
Haha, thanks. When was that changed?
---
Good advice, thank you!
---
Sadly, not profitable means it will be abandoned by most of the player base soon.
---
PvErs would be ideal starting out! But you are right, it's hard to catch them.
---
Thanks for the other tips though.
---
Short answer yes go kiki.
---
&gt;lol if you roam for just an hour you'll never find any content
---
That's worrying :(
---
uh yeah welcome to 2012+
---
there are dozens of free to play optional subscription mmos out there
---
Ultrawide bro &lt;3
---
Ooof... uhm, i would restart you cpu and if that doesn’t do it, check your drivers and make sure up to date, then reinstall Eve. Hope it works soon!
---
Thank you so much! I'm just about to start watching what you linked.
---
Apparently NPSI entities do.
---
Really good advice, thanks for that. I've been studying up on that for months, getting my in game knowledge up.
---
Probably null or low. It's not easy finding content in WH.
---
Do you mean doing that when we're in a fight we're not going to win?
---
That's good advice, thank you Jintaan =) Someone else linked your videos and I've just started watching them. I'm really loving your vids so far.
---
cmonBruh
---
Lol, the actual gameplay isn't really any different than the plethora of other PVE options in EVE.  Only difference is this one has no rewards and a coat of "its new lel".
---
Don’t join their discord to get more info, join their discord to contribute the info you have. The point of the above poster is that if you want it to continue, help them write it.
---
We got paper so we set
---
This means we can fit two separate invasions into a single year though!
---
Not salty at all. Our alliance is a much better place without him and his vanity squad posts is all.
---
Judging by your score here I'd say more people agree with my assessment than yours.
---
We're just doing our part to help the environment of eve by taking out the boring trash that evil space-litterers leave unattended.
---
So you use your ISK to purchase PLEX to pay fir your subscription to Eve? If so, then I am the person you are relying upon. Without folks buying PLEX to PvP with, folks don't have a means to play as an Omega for free.
---
Sometimes I think this game's saving grace is that the most boring activities tend to be the most relaxing.
---
Ehhhh kinda. I mean your premise is correct but I would find a way to play one way or the other. With or without plex. But it would dictate how many toons I have lol.
---
Who is RC?
---
If you are doing an FW roam or want to camp novice plexes, try a scram kiting build, the trig's exceptional tracking and fairly good range makes it great even if you get caught and have to brawl.
---
If it ever comes back, I would love for the screen rendering to be client side so I can watch movies on my computer with my character
---
Your link has a bunch if Spectre on the wrong side, even has Redline on CVA side. Guess that is how he always has positive battle report results, he is listed on wrong side lol.
---
Freedom freedom niggas
---
Locator agents, they tell you where a character is.
---
TBH: 21 caps is a few at this point.
---
The whole "War Declaration" was the type of posts that Redline loved to post touting his vanity squad of the month when he was still in GSF. I'm soooo glad he is exposing the rest of Eve to his drivel now lol.
---
Rory &gt; Vysh
---
i was the phoenix pilot.
---
it got real fuckin hairy when it was the fort + 4 revs shooting me. thank god for that hero that brought shield links as i started to bleed armor.
---
Hmm. Was correct when I posted it, but looks like some more kills got pulled in and screwed up the team selection in the process. I've put an updated link in the OP.
---
Change doesn't alter the result much. Adds a few hundred mill on both sides.
---
