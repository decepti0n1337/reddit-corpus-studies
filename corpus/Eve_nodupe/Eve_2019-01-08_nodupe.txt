Has anyone compiled all the MERs for the last 12-18 months and maybe added in markers for the patch dates? would be nice to know how over inflaited the eve economy is and if literally any changes made have done anything.

Not even Provi would take you. Learn how to PvP and defend yourselves, or rent. 
---
What do you mean "you doubt it?" What do you doubt? You're saying the same thing I am - that if anom spawn rate were changed to WH/scannable site mechanics then groups would have to move around, utilize an entire region, and/or spread out to multiple regions, weakening their currently very strong defenses. What do you doubt...? 
---
&gt; In any event, it would make "1 region" the optimal territory size for an alliance, because then you can cover the entire spawn zone for your anomalies, which would make life harder for groups which can't handle that, while not significantly making life harder for groups which can.
---
You're contradicting yourself. You say this as if there is no downside to shrinking your coalition footprint down to a single region if you currently utilize multiple regions. Systems which today are not heavily utilized for a variety of reasons (location, risk of being dropped, truesec) would by necessity need to be utilized. Systems that are heavily utilized could support fewer people since there would be fewer sites in each system. It would absolutely make life harder for groups which can cover a single region easily.
---
No company is like that... Teams will generally continue supporting their own code, because they know the most about it.

&gt;I don't get why it wouldn't be worth logging in to make some money rather than not logging in and making nothing.

Because my time would be better spent doing anything but playing eve.
---
If I'm only going to be getting a fraction of my income for more effort due to the vigilance needed to operate while war decced....then I'm just going to play some thing else this week. I'd rather put that effort in to some thing that will give me a full reward than half a reward.
---
Is there any basis for those numbers you choose?
---
The new direction CCP has pushed the game is so disillusioned from the reality of what makes this game fun I am surprised we are not seeing a larger exodus of players.   
---
I'm sure IA. is void of people breaking the rules but hey.

yeah ik, he hasnt lived in stain for a while lol

At first i saw the underwhelming shirt with a pod thread (the pod looks like a testicle), then i saw this, and was kinda yeah, frozen corpse, that's better. Then it hit me - THE SALT. take my upvote

Wtb shiptoast
---
Turning on the audio and good graphic settings to run some abyssal sites is super chill, especially if you normally focus on F1 monkeying with 5 accounts running and potato graphics. Really recommend it for anyone who hasnt tried it out yet 
---
So the only thing you enjoy about EVE is making isk? 
---
I too listen to infromation from people that aren't allied with Horde. Especially after having all my ships SRPed and new FLEX structures when they were added to the game.
---
Now fix the default overview and I can get my friends to give this game another try without quitting after 20min and calling me a retard
---
Fair tbh
---
They're not going to ban him.
---
Shiptoast not on market in Jita, can I buy it in contracts?

Stainguy is like Taylor Swift in 2010. A saint. You take them bad words back.

---
You don't really know what you are talking about.
---
I think a lot of people expected it to have much more of an impact then it really has and I personally couldnt care less about it. Rolled an expensive module once, got a shitty one and never tried it again, happy when something I kill drops a good abyssal module and tilted that expensive ones dont show up on zkillboard with their value, other then that not much changed. 
---
I really fail to understand why super ratting is considered a problem, but ark multi boxing rorquals are left over.... 1 player can’t control more than 1 super at the time, but he can easily control over 9000 rorquals. It doesn’t add up for me.
---
No, you're just being dense on the internet.
---
No, I enjoy having my time respected.
---
If you're telling me I can have half my usual output for an increase in input then I'll just laugh at you and go and just play another game until eve starts respecting my time again.
---
Imagine turning up to work and your boss told you that you had to work an extra 2hrs a day every day this week, and you'd be getting 50% of your pay cheque this week. You'd tell him in no uncertain terms to go and fuck himself.

BRING BACK TRISTAN DACUHNA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TRISTAN IS DNG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

you're right, It's CCP's job to police them and they don't. So the least we can do is call them out on their bullshit

Hi, you called?

yea, you should know. 
---
It's overreaching. Sure no one will probably outside it, but the audacity to claim you have that kind of far reaching power, as if that small town company has to follow the rules you set halfway across the world. And just because no one would do anything about it, doesn't mean that's true with every situation. 
---
Ok maybe you can help me because google searches only turn up results of people complaining about "cap proliferation." This appears to be something that happened while i was away from the game, so maybe you can fill me in on how it happened?
---
You could actually get a decent idea of the power behind some weapons by doing napkin math. A scourge fury light missile without modifiers weighs 700kg and travels at 3750m/s giving 4.9 billion joules of energy which according to eve inflicts 116 kinetic damage.   
---
Allowing for no resists or player skills a Merlin will take 11 missiles to destroy, 5 to completely bring down the shields, so the merlin can shield tank around 20 billion joules of energy which is about 5556 kilowatt hours. According to a quick google search an American home uses about 10400 KWh a year. So a Merlin's shield alone consumes almost 2 household's yearly power.

new eve is dying theory in 10...
---
You're being a fucking retard. Input broadcasting chat messages is not a bannable offence (according to the GM i talked to). 
---
yes, and yes
---
Imho no it hasn't been the end of the world.  The people who previously rocked high-grade snakes, full faction fits, CD alts for boosts, etc, now abyssal their stuff too.  They were a tiny minority in the grand scheme and were already a challenging fight, now a bit more so.  But seems like little impact to the rest of EVE.  
---
However, prices are still coming down on the abyssal muta thingies, so we'll see in time as supply keeps coming in but there is only so much demand from the 0.1% where things end up.  I still don't think it'll be the end of the world - if for no other reason that I can't be bothered to deal with the awful process of buying and fitting abyssal mods / fits.  
---
I'm not talking about enterprise size, I'm talking about the audacity of some Belgium unelected beauracrat acting like someone small company in the US needs to follow the rules they've written.

Not really for PVP, but my Rapier can now web out to my lockrange so that's interesting.

It was already published on gaming websites as a cheating article...   not exactly the publicity you can afford to have, and then have follow up articles about how you didn't do anything about it.
---
They wouldn't unless they were afraid. 
---
True, not the best example. Anyways, Fozzie did see the thread and told people to report it properly.
---
They're still not going to ban him, i'll eat my hat if they do.
---
Wrong on both counts.

Aren't we still in the 6 month post X47 refractory period?

---
You have your Merlins and Homes backwards at the end.

Uh oh looks like test and frt learned what really win wars...rorquals at home
---
Most likely... tbf I only said he came I didnt say when xD

Can you explain your question? 
---
soo lets shit post to reddit to hope somone get banned.
---
Gobbins cares for and plays only for Gobbins. 
---
Always has, always will. 
---
Recalling excavators would be terrible except for sentries, your rorqs don't finish mining at the same time otherwise. Same with aligning, when are you going to use that and not warp? I use 2 rorquals and fleet warp anyways. Same for compression you're ores are going to be stacked differently assuming you're not just cherry picking, and even then you need to do it so infrequently there is no point in input broadcasting.
---
Botting with rorqs, if you can get a bot to figure out how to do them ok. But otherwise the small uses like recalling all ur drones at the same time just seem dumb to input broadcast for.

What do you doubt...? 
---
I doubt that it would slow down the serious anom farmers at all.  They'll have their entire region, and they'll have their carrier jump drives, and they'll probably have to jump once an hour to find new farming grounds or something, but that's far from an imposition.  I instead expect that it would make life difficult for groups that are smaller than needing an entire region, because they can't do the same thing.  Under no circumstances will it make acquiring a second region worth it.  More likely, it would make acquiring a second region after the first one less desirable, because then you'd want a *whole* second region, and not just a constellation or something.

Any suggestions on the best episodes to get started?
---
CCP wants garbage news articles? Ok...
---
he temporarily forgot how to type, so he had to make a video
---
Can you be specific? 
---
so what should I do because I still wanna run abyss sites and I could use a ship that costs about 2-300m but dont wanna die all the time. The problem is socket closure then I burn out past the invisible death barrier and die :(
---
He was being facetious 
---
Long story very short, 3 mIn changes contributed to caps becoming powerful and ubiquitous, more widespread than the slowcat days, though not much more cancerous. 
---
1) Skill injectors allow pilots to quickly gain SP, drastically shortening the long training time to effectively fly a capital.
---
2) Rorquals we're introduced, each easily and scalably mining several hulk's worth of m3. Their extreme tank and PANIC module meant that tackled rorqs could easily be saved by local response fleets, who often had 10-15 minutes to form and respond. Their extreme value made them attractive targets to drop on and kill. This balance lead to local response fleets becoming stronger in order to defend valuable assets. The glut of minerals on the market had to go somewhere, and the best isk was caps and supers. 
---
3) Dread/HAW and carrier/fighter changes  made caps and supers more versatile and arguably more powerful. The introduction of FAXes, many times stronger than triage carriers, made dropping supers and titans a battle of whittling down FAXes faster than your enemy. Fighters apply very well to subcaps, and carriers start being used extensively to counter subcaps.
---
In summary, Rorquals and injectors lowered the barrier of entry both in terms of SP and isk for caps and supers. They also necessitated powerful, local response fleets over mobile doctrines that allowed extreme projection. Now, the balance has shifted quite far, with the common ending to many small and medium sized roams being a few boson titans on a gate or a lot cyno and dozens of supers.
---
I'll be honest, I almost only used taranis in low-sec so no need for nullification and all my use was from back when only the T3 cruisers had nullification (as a submodule that really gimped combat)
---
Right. Tl;Dr fucking please
---
Ha! Big tough internet troll gets scared on the internet. Piss-weak.
---
And still no love for whs
---
I now have a blops hunter Tengu that can tank a few sieged dreadnaughts with its XL shield booster at 0 m/s and is cap stable, so I dont see a problem with abyssal balance.....
---
You can have fun solo,  but it prevents you from experiencing large parts of the game.  Many people enjoy solo eve for years.
---
Eve is a social game, try it out - you may make some long term friends.
---
The way you're talking and the examples you are presenting seem to indicate that unless you are making the level of isk you consider "having your time respected" you'd do something else. 
---
So that begs my question again - is there nothing else that motivates you to log in besides making isk? 
---
You can play solo, it just depends what you want to do in the game?
---
all l see is talk, what can you do if you am going to do something just do it dont post a vid about Ohh lm going to do something
---
unironically quoting massivelyop, the DailyNews of gaming websites.
---
The best parts of the game are the parts both alongside and against groups of nerds. 
---
Oh yes, I'm aware how to do it - and I've managed since then a few times. Still, it was less the difficulty of acquiring the gas than it was my own incompetence at wormholing. After I'd gotten a full bay, I went back to the bookmark where my entry had been and it was gone.
---
... Took me a few tries to find a connection that didn't go to nullsec or yet *another* wormhole. Aridia's not my favorite place to visit, but it beats landing in someone's backyard.
---
All of them, until he threatens to chop your hands off.
---
Move to Kansas City, MO or Provo, UT where you can have Google Fiber!
---
You're not suppose to fuck aura. she's an AI, so of course you're going to have a bad time
---
Hmm.. we rallyed before in jita and shot things. Maybe its time again.
---
Personal opinions. I would say that it has a few definite noticeable effects.
---
The first is fewer targets in space. Even though Abyssal has a strong penalty for failure, its instanced protection means that you have PvE in a relatively controlled and uninterruptible environment, so it's quite popular. However wormhole space daytripping is virtually dead, as is DED exploration (pretty much only escalations are run nowadays). Along with rorqs and various tendencies for groups to build tall rather than spread wide means that in general, targeting PvE ships has a much higher average difficulty and much sparser outside the Rorq herds of delve. I also feel, unqualified, as if the active carrier and super count has increased by at least an order of magnitude, and more vacant space is being left rented--which encourages obvious multi-bot setups that are becoming more common.
---
The PvE is well-designed, however, and I think CCP is at least stepping in the right direction with the contents of the sites. It is variable and challenging, and having co-op content with the triple frigate traces at least opens up more group play. However the difficulty scaling is a bit much, essentially with a huge jump between 2 to 3 traces and 4-5 the realm of blinged out HACs and Gilas. One suggestion I liked is if 4-5s were available as T1 cruiser fleet content. There are complaints too with the all-or-nothing timers, which are not tolerant of disconnects.
---
In terms of the drops, it's quite lucrative though a lot of that has to do with market pricing of the Triglavian ships, which are good enough to fetch high prices. The Leshak and Kikimora in particular are fearsome: the Leshak has much utility and projects what is essentially Vindicator DPS at full-ramp, so it's become known as a premier capital killer; the Kikimora also projects more dps than nearly any other destroyer is capable of (600ish) to 50km, with high speeds and is formidable at nearly any scale. I think the general feel of the community on these two ships, Kikimora especially once entropic rigs are released, is that they deserve nerfs. The Damavik is a little weak on fitting, and the logi are certainly nothing super broken. The Leshak and BC are in my opinion in fairly good places at the moment.
---
Mutaplasmids are strong. A little risky as you can brick modules, but very good return--you can roll a MWD with the lowest grade muta and get something faster than A-type. The effect of this is that ships scale better with wealth. If you're willing to invest in good rolls for your ship and soak the losses of poor ones, you can get some ridiculous stats out of things. High end ships like AT ships are almost always fully Abyssal rolled now. While it does shake things up a bit and empower players who are both experienced and wealthy, I would venture to say that the flip side of the coin is the barriers to entry to PvP is higher particularly as Abyssal supply increases and mutaplasmids become more common--because currently, they are definitely underutilized. I mean it's like dudes with high-grade snake sets kiting around lowsec. Combined with zero-drawback agency drugs, the power gap between a ship and its maximum-bling counterpart has increased ever so much more. Unless mutaplasmid mechanics change or prices drop dramatically, I think that's going to be an unavoidable side effect of the Abyss.
---
They did, then they changed it back because they realised a single tweet probably wasn't the best way to announce it.
---
Who cares??
---
Go roam delve in a neut alt and see how many groups of rorqs named the same, flown by very similar pilot names, sharing the same picture, all pull excavators on the same tick.
---
You haven't been paying attention or you are new here, this is my thing. I make an claim and then bait people into saying it's impossible then I follow through. Peep my flair publord, why do you think the comments here are so vague in their insults? Why do you think nobody has posted saying that what I claim won't happen? Haven't you noticed that my detractors attack my character rather than my claims?
---
If everybody just posts on reddit and nobody actually reports him in game, he's not going to get banned. 
---
I am exactly where I plan to be.

The last episode with Matteral with the year in review is excellent. He has Vily, Killahbee, and other FCs all talking about the highlights of 2018.
---
You’re one of these people who thinks their smarter than they really are
---
6k dps tank on a tengu. Damn
---
Well since I dont know everything there is to do in the game, to put it shortly. I want to make an impact on a group or if time ever passed and I ever managed to become big in the game I want to affect the entire game itself. I know the economy is ran by the community and most of the game. The game seems much different compared to other mmos so playing solo wont give me the same entertainment or satisfaction as other games have
---
What else drops there? God i miss static deds
---
I'm actually not that smart, my enemies are just really stupid. 
---
Miss your streams dude.
---
In high sec? No, there's pretty much fuck all else to do in high sec but pve which is only worth doing because it provides a monetary reward.
---
Ahhh I know your pain of trying to go back through an EOL hole only to find it’s gone. I’d say it gets easier but I still do stuff like that lol

Tri anchors fortizar and show up with 5 chars (2 sabre taranis,astero, and idk?)  epic for the next book history of EVE

I was gonna go, but family stuff came up.  I'm gonna try to get to Toronto but no guarantees haha
---
With high grade crystals ofc
---
You are seeing a large exodus of players they’re just not vocal as they no longer care
---
which is literally bullshit because the excavators are probably on different rocks, orbiting so god knows on what side they are.
---
everyone saying "literally the same tick bruh" is just dumb.

&gt; all pull excavators on the same tick.

There are many ways to impact a group form being a standard linemember who fights for a group to an HR guy who goes through and accepts applications to a fleet commander who commands up to thousands of other players in a battle.

You are wrong. That is against the EULA. There are three things that aren't banable for input broadcasting. Chat is not one of them

Ok so this summary solidifies my opinion here. Cap proliferation isn't a problem. 
---
Because the thing is this: if it's so easy why don't you do it?
---
From where i'm sitting it sounds like you want to be able to strike them and then get away before they strike back. It sounds very risk averse, it sounds very much like what you are criticizing them for. It sounds very "carebear."
---
If you want to slip in and do damage and slip out why don't you use speed and stealth to cover you? Why should they have to simply not be allowed to defend themselves why don't you try and improve your tactics?
---
What do you do with the isk once you've made it? 
---
Bingo. Though, I envisioned this as best used on things with bonuses to Hacking modules, e.g. exploration craft such as the Heron. Just like the relationship between Probe Launcher and Expanded Probe Launcher / Combat Scanner Probes, the fitting requirements of a Combat Data Analyzer would be a bit harder to pull off than a normal one. There's also range to consider. You'd also still have to get pretty close to the enemy and not get primaried. I more imagine it like, you fly a Covert Ops ship (or other ships with explicit bonuses to Hacking) amidst the battle and decloak next to the enemy ship and then start literally hacking its brains out. 
---
Why so defensive if it’s not true...
---
No one wants to be a rat we just want to bitch.
---
You can build ships for your corp/alliance that they use to completely annihilate others in wars. You can solo pvp/pve. You can be a market mogul and dictate the price of some market niche you found. You could completely buy out market orders in a small missioning hub. Then set up a monopoly and constantly crush all opposition? Just let your inner psycho out and get creative. Jump in the game and start building a sand castle. Try to make friends along the way. I play solo for just an hour or so some nights because I don't have much time these days. But when I did have time, I used to run in pvp fleets with some of the highest ranked lowsec pilots at that time, laugh/joke always be on comms. Right now, I started a new pilot to relearn the game since it's been a long time. Slowly building up and achieving personal goals and keeping new goals and ideas ahead of me. It's fun for me that way. And when I get more time or I can be loud again(kids/wife sleeping in tiny apartment atm) then I will be more active on comms. 
---
I’m guessing you’ve lost excavators recently. QQ
---
As for the skills, read this. https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skills:Social#Connections
---
Only if you make a rule to prevent it. There are no rules against it right now.
---
unblock me
---
Theoretically, According to pyfa anyways. Haven't had a scenario occur where I could. But tank holds at 6374 dps, stable at 62% with a few thukker batteries so it could probably hold against a few neuts.
---
All it really needs at most though  is 5 mins for the cyno to finish its  cycle while the fleet melts whatever I tackled.
---
Content creating small groups? Yeah right. Delve is where content is at judging by the MER. What do you actually think we do with the isk we earn and the production we do? The only reason the universe is complaining about supercapital proliferation is because we showed you the results of our krabbing at 6RCQ and X47 etc. 
---
BL+Horde attacking deadco wasn't content creation, it was content deletion. Because the entire north could've krabbed themselves enough hardware to have a shot at winning next time. Instead deadco, BL and horde will have to just tuck-tail and run next time we pipe up on your doorstep because you obviously don't have much more than you did in the last war. 
---
I think smaller groups are more often than not disbanding because of reasons small groups disbanded for ten years ago. The leader often being a sort of a one-man-band deal who does everything that makes a corp function, and often knowingly or unknowingly suppresses people who could've taken some of the workload. 
---
PS: Goons and INIT fuck up NCdot titans on the regular. 160bn worth of dreads to kill 2 dreads? Great trade, each titan gets 2.6bn insurance payout if you pay the 0.8bn to get platinum insurance. Sure the zkillboard of our alliances look terrible after such a trade but we don't commit seppuku because of red on our killboard, so we just think its fun content. And because we have good economy people in charge of our efforts to make it as easy as possible for members to krab whenever they want however much they want, in whatever way they want, we can afford to make shit trades every day. 
---
Krabbing IS content creation, because it affords the luxury of putting assets on the field even when its not a slam dunk.

At X47 armor timer we traded badly to begin with, but we were prepared to trade badly until DT because we can replace our losses faster than the enemy. And because panfam tuck-tail and runs every time their zkill will look back, because they'll commit seppuku if they see red on zkill, they started extracting and docking and logging off to sleep, and then we pulled it back from losing 2 to 1, to ending up at having traded 1 for 1. 
---
PPS: In X47 hull timer, PL was so risk-averse (or incompetent) because they're poor, so PL cynoed in out of range of the goon titans. 
---
I'm complying with this sub forums rules.  Please point me to a rule I would be breaking?
---
I really like TIS.  By far, Killah Bee is always the most balanced and fair guest, he really says just the facts as he sees them.  Progod is my second favorite, you would think these guys have an agenda when on the show, but they are pretty objective.  Elise is pretty good, but when he says "Tapi" it shows a little bias.
---
Honestly, glad to see less of Brisc, he doesn't seem to bring much to the show from a game standpoint.  
---
I give Matterall so much credit for building a high quality show.
---
Im really getting sick and tired of all the useless fucking post here, this one included. 
---
That's what I'm saying you aren't breaking any rules at the moment.  
---
Yikes, you are quite salty. This is esp cute coming from a Shiva member where the whole time your corp has been around, you have been doing play fights. The latest with NC and Horde. Real nice, idiot.
---
/u/concernedeve is probably a butt hurt guy that lost his ratting VNI to Evictus. a bunch of times 
---
Honestly, this is silly and for some reason I find it offensive. Let’s say he does Input broadcast to make isk or something else. Let CCP investigate and deal with it. If his only offense is input broadcasting a few chat messages - is it really worth trying to ruin his free time. I know that is silly and you may think the post is funny! In part, I agree. However, cmon this is all of our free time. Doing this isn’t worth ruining how someone else may destress after work. 
---
Make in-game reports. Email CCP. But using public pressure as a form to get someone banned just seems absurd for that act. Show us him input broadcasting for a real reason. 
---
I don’t know why I felt like making this post. I really don’t. He (or she) violated the rules. But for the “wrong” he committed that you can prove - is it really worth saying look you no longer are allowed to be apart of this community and you are no longer allowed to use this game as a way to get away from the real world? C’mon! Just seems silly. Report him. Email CCP. Forcing CCP’s hand over this minor thing just is silly. 
---
&gt;They shouldn't have to report him after something so obvious...   Then again it took them months to finally do something about My mothers dogs neighbors 2 streets over (totally not gigx)  playing...  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I probably spend the majority of it on plex, or plex related stuff.
---
He rest I spend on just fitting out ships to either try something dumb or to decorate my hangar.
---
and you 
---
&gt;If you want to slip in and do damage and slip out why don't you use speed and stealth to cover you? Why should they have to simply not be allowed to defend themselves why don't you try and improve your tactics?
---
Same reason elite dvd groups spend all day beating on noob and carebear groups instead of fighting each other, easy frags.
---
its not a speed issues its when the connection drops for a split second you're screwed because of the abyss mechanics 
---
With optimal vninskills youre still only looking at 16mil or so per tick so average money is very accessible but the ceiling is very low. Its good practice for higher tier pve tho and a reliable way to work into gilas/rattlesnakes where the money gets better
---
Well, in all honesty  
---
If people would refrain from posting anything that /may/ have happened to /someone at /some/ point of EVE history, there would no longer be any posts on here  
---
As if you think of it that way, basically all the small things one can do or enjoy probably happened to someone somewhere.
---
Originality is an oddly skewed concept if something has been around for a long time.  
---
So yeah, sorry i guess that I didnt post a killmail of Mittani in a titan killed by a T1 noobship? Or something?  
---
Next time just keep scrolling buddy o7
---
They cant sale fixing\\balancing on the plex market now can they? 
---
Did they ban the previous users that were shown publicly that they used input broadcast?
---
To bad these holes never spawn 
---
A a returning capsule after being gone for 2 years, how do I explore as an alpha clone? I have looked at many guides for omega exploration, but none of the tools they list are available for alpha members. 
---
It's funnier if you're being unironically salty.
---
See! This is why I posted this. I figured people would remember similar things, and maybe get a smirk out of it.  
---
Wasn't expecting to blow people's minds, just cause some minor amusement, and as long as at least some people got that, mission accomplished! Fly safe and have a good day o7
---
That sounds like something Gorskie or those Anime people would like. 
---
But maybe the sigs only spawn when there havnt been activity in close star proximity the last 2 days ?
---
"People can only be successful on my terms."
---
I don't want him to be perma banned.  However, I also don't want to see 6 months go by before ccp decides they want to do something about it either.   Its against the rules...  He knows its against the rules, everyone knows its against the rules.   When you break the rules, your punished. 
---
Yeah solo roaming Catch is difficult. This morning I flew my Wolf into EX6. The night before, I had roamed down into Impasse, got a fight or two, got chased, safe logged after getting camped into a dead end. Relogged this morning, started home to Delve. Decided instead to stop off into EX6, cause I had to go to work. Arrived at the EX6 gate, and spied a Jaguar, the perfect fight for my Wolf. I jumped in, and he followed. I immediately engaged. MWD, keep at range set 5K, Scrammed him, MWD off, weapons engaged. about midway through the fight, Jag looked like he was breaking, and a whole damn gang jumped into us. Legion, Hecate, Vexor, Cormorant, Enyo.  I got blapped down hard. They gave me GF's and Ill be honest, I was so irritated at having that awesome fight interrupted I just replied "nah" and continued on my way.
---
Imagine being this retarded.
---
I was thinking about a UI overhaul the other day. But I was at a total loss as to how (if I did it) I would even contemplate changing it. Plus what about veteran players getting butt hurt about a new UI? Obviously they should have a legacy UI option to check/uncheck in the settings.
---
zkill would tell you
---
I was banned for a week for posting a link of a turtle eating a mouse no initial warning. Fuck this dude. Ccp should punish all rule breakers, especially well publicized ones. The dude does the same thing on bombing runs
---
&gt;did you file a ticket?   I mean your on the CSM...and you know he broke the rules...  guessing prob not, but I will give you the benefit of the doubt and await your answer.
---
Ah ok, 6k dps is more reasonable. 
---
This is art
---
Look and kid crying for its safe space, people are actually upvoting.... EvE community like reddit is a liberal snowflake cesspool. sick
---
Ah so since more people are cheating it is suddenly ok?
---
They amplify his fuckup with all this reddit stunt mainly because they want to get rid of his afk camping. It is not a silly thing. It's just goons getting rid of ingame problems with metagame warfare 
---
you're gonna be real upset when you find out they already checked it out and decided he didn't break any rules :(
---
&gt; I doubt that it would slow down the serious anom farmers at all. They'll have their entire region, and they'll have their carrier jump drives
---
I think you are _drastically_ underestimating how many sites these people are running. 
---
And then somehow he gets it built in a week.
---
Spawn one in L-SDU7 
---
I'm fine with that. Chain running anoms is bad gameplay IMO. If you find other ways to make the same isk, cheers to you. But they are probably either more effort, require upfront isk, or don't scale to a many-thousand person alliance well.
---
I'm like 99.9% sure you can't get a super into a hole. At all.
---
&gt; If you want to slip in and do damage and slip out why don't you use speed and stealth to cover you? Why should they have to simply not be allowed to defend themselves why don't you try and improve your tactics?
---
When did I say this? "You just have to evolve" is a common refrain and it rings hollow every time. There is no counter to getting a dozen supers dropped on your 10 man cruiser gang. You just leave. "Why don't you do it" demonstrates that you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about - there's no point dropping dreads on someone's home defense fleet. You're going to feed and at most they'll lose some faxes. Moving a super fleet large enough to successfully win that fight would attract the attention of the people you're hunting. Perhaps instead of spouting off about what other people should be doing literally one comment after admitting you know nothing about contemporary capital war in Eve, you should sit and try to learn something.
---
It's r/eve mods man, they delete shit all the time for no reason other than personal dislike, he's letting you know he personally dislikes him pointing out  marshy is still active and will delete his threads if he doesn't agree to not post.
---
The mods decide, not the users. 
---
I've never said that, ever
---
Ah damn I saw you replied I was hoping it was that lossmail... nah it's probably too embarrassing 
---
How do you use it? Do you have to drink it?

Thought I fixed it.

No that was brisc
---
&gt; 10 man cruiser gang.
---
This is your problem, you are bringing a knife to a gunfight. Why don't you bring your capitals if you want to fight someone big with capitals?
---
You haven't presented me with anything that shows why you shouldn't have to evolve with the rest of the game. Boohoo you can't cripple empires with your 10 man cruiser gang hitting defenseless miners. I don't feel bad for you at this point.
---
pls no bully the boots
---
Why do you think I give a shit about PL or your victories against them? I'm not in PL. I think Panfam is just as much of a problem as Goons and TEST are. I'm absolutely not arguing that what Goons accomplished after WWB is trivial. Your leadership saw the writing on the wall much sooner than the rest of the game and started adjusting. You built a massive supercap and titan force, made it your mission to get the Average Joe into a titan, and it worked. No one can beat Goons supers on the field. Congratulations. You were in an alliance that made smart decisions, and for some reason you feel like that makes you special. Hooray for you!
---
&gt; Krabbing IS content creation, because it affords the luxury of putting assets on the field even when its not a slam dunk.
---
This is pants-on-head stupid. Krabbing is only content creation when there is a meaningful chance of conflict. You need krabs and bears to support conflict, just like you need PvPers to generate content. It takes both. Goons' attitude makes great sense for massive super vs. super fights. You can afford to feed tackle supers, most other groups can't. Luckily for everyone involved such fights are *exceedingly* rare. You foaming at the mouth about how special Goons are (and you by extension) doesn't change the fact that every single PvP group in the game has just accepted that you cannot roam most places where people are anymore, or else you'll just get bosoned and blobbed to death. If you call dropping supers and titans on anything that moves in Delve or Esoteria "content," congratulations. You're driving your own content away. 
---
Yeah, the game is built around groups of players building things together (and then someone else coming to burn it all down).  That said, there are plenty of people who are members of one of those corporations/alliances but pretty much play solo anyway.  You just have to pick your group carefully.
---
Eve is free so try it and see
---

---
Countless of tiny bugs for me wich put together, are really really putting on my nerves.
---
kotaku.com
---
It probably is actually. But we can be certain the purpose isn't chatting, so the ban wouldn't be for that.
---
there are r/eve mods that will straight up ban people they don't like "for lulz"
---
Definitely. Eating an edible and super ratting at max settings is really relaxing
---
So we should now assume CCP protects certain players. This must be the reason reporting is useless.
---
same, all my friends rage coz they can't find the "options" pit next to the overview, same for other tiny little hidden buttons all arouns the UI.
---
Don't worry OP, I've got an idea -- you just need to make a bunch of reddit accounts and then input broadcast the thread each day.  They won't ban you for that.
---
Pretty high resists cold as well so who knows, heated hardeners are  approaching  ADC/PANIC numbers

Whataboutism

marshy should just join the imperium and then all the spods here would stop bothering him, after as per the mittani at that point they wouldn't be sure anymore of his offence :&gt;
---
Hint: Bots go where the easy money is; Exploration bots are becoming more common.
---
ride his dick harder
---
yes
---
1/512 =/= .002% source: passed middle school maths
---
if marshy gets banned, can the goon botters and input broadcasters go down with him too :thinking:
---
There is a certain narrow mindedness that a lot of players in the major sov null alliances have. They're only willing or capable of thinking in certain terms. To you, the idea that flying around and blowing up other people's ships is fun even if it doesn't bring down Rome is foreign. We're playing a video game. I don't want to see brave or TEST or Goons disband, and the goal of any of the fleets I lead is not to bring down the big guys. I don't want to kill your miners - I'd much prefer that you undock something and we slug it out. But you don't do that. You escalate so far over the top that the only thing your enemy can do is leave - and that's your goal. You don't _want_ a fight; you want to be left alone. 
---
You show a total lack of understanding of the politics of eve right now. There is no group in the game that is going to bring a large force of caps into Brave or Eso or Delve or Tribute right now without an overt invasion. You're portraying the situation as a simple one. Your enemy uses capitals; you should, too. Why not, after all? They're cheap! 
---
First, if you move a cap fleet large enough to fight the local response fleet, everyone will notice. You can't do that unnoticed without significant effort, more effort than any sane person is willing to undertake regularly. Second, you cannot drop more caps than any of the major alliances without them seeing it coming. If you bring 100 dreads, you'll find your enemies drop 2 faxes for every dread you drop. 
---
You literally just said you have no idea why caps are so strong or popular, and yet here you are, making a fool of yourself. 
---
Stainguy is just trying to defend his title as best shitposter. Its lonely at the top. If he didnt shitpost so much, we would have to see everyone else's shitposts which are worse than stainguy posts.
---
Are you really that retarded, that you think he enabled input broadcasting to send chat messages?
---
Normally I'd say this is your best post yet, but today has been fuckin awesome. Please continue.
---
input broadcasting in and of itself isn't against the rules
---
it's just the majority of actions that can be done with input broadcasting are
---
Just go to the north, you can fly around with impunity in an astero, people will think you're a bot.
---
Yet it's completely fine to bridage/witch hunt the ever living fuck out of Marshy? How do you not see that the effort put into getting Marshy banned could just as well be used to do some house cleaning and at least not seem incredibly hypocritical?
---
Look, I get where you're coming from, small gangs was a big part of many player's gameplay, but the only place I see that happening today is in incursion constellations. Maybe they should be reduced in number, all in lowsec, and be buffed, so they're worth fighting over? Sansha titan bpc drop? 
---
There's just no way to put the empire building cat back into the bag. Look elsewhere for your solution. 
---
Then create awareness about the botting issues in general instead of going after one guy who ultimately has little to no impact on the game.
---
"score hidden" poor old dumbdwarf doesn't want people to see how much support there is for a campaign to get Marshy what he deserves
---
This isn’t fair, they didn’t show what they said said next. All 3 said “jinx!!!”... “Double jinx!!!” Etc 
---
There is a way, it's by changing anom spawn mechanics. But I think at the end of the day you're right. After all, you're a better customer than me (statistically). Players wanted farms and fields; they got 'em. I just wonder what happens when that's all they've got.
---
There is a mission agent outside the site in a caracal. Kill him to get it. He spawns once at downtime and once 30 minutes after he is killed.

Some Caldari faction loot and a ton of faction tags. ~500 - 1b per run, takes about an hour with 2 gilas and a Tengu and can be done twice a day.

As someone who's been completely out of the loop who's Mar5hy ?and why hasn't he been banned?
---
&gt; I was banned for a week for posting a link of a turtle eating a mouse no initial warning 
---
Well you see, you're just dumb for thinking that wouldn't get you banned for a week
---
That's what she said, she was wrong
---
&gt;Honestly, this is silly and for some reason I find it offensive. Let’s say he does Input broadcast to make isk or something else. Let CCP investigate and deal with it. If his only offense is input broadcasting a few chat messages - is it really worth trying to ruin his free time. I know that is silly and you may think the post is funny! In part, I agree. However, cmon this is all of our free time. Doing this isn’t worth ruining how someone else may destress after work.
---
  
---
Well, the rules apply to everyone. He's clearly broadcasting and he shall be sanctioned cause that's what the rules say. I don't want him to get banned for good, but he should stop using tools that make his life easier and which are against the rules.   
---
I don't broadcast, but if I would do, you would see an outcry too, like it happened with the last goon that got caught broadcasting (as far as I know, he was banned). It's  just that simply - if you want to apply the rules when goons do it, then you can't stop applying them when some anti-goon does it. Why? Cause that's Bias and a Publisher shouldn't be biased. :)

fyi, score is hidden for the first hour after a comment is posted.

Speed is certainly great, but so is its stability
---
&gt;One that doesnt really require any voice comms?
---
Voice comms are mandatory for fleets
---
Yeah he only input broadcast across like 10 accounts which is also bannable and has been bannable for a few years now. You're right he should not be punished for breaking the rules and we should leave him alone.
---
More likely, I'm drastically overestimating the clear times on the sites, but that may be a distinction without a difference here.  If they're jumping once an hour, then it'd be sustainable.  If that's in the range of 5-15 sites, however, I can see that being unattainable.
---
I always recommend new players join up with Eve University to learn the ropes.

I think what im trying to get at is solo play doesnt seem fun to me, but it seems impossible to get a with a big group

That's fair. If I had "fuck you" money I'd bankroll some ridiculous world changing shit, but real life expenses are more important than space pixels.

As much as I like blowing things up, exploration is also fun.
---
All my alts are named as Cpt- Are they bots?
---
"I only use it for chat"
---
  lol
---
No one cares. Most of us would rather not have to sift through posts for the next however long, while people witch hunt to try and get someone banned because it'll make them feel good.
---
This person was caught input broadcasting in chat accidentally. Clearly he’s using it for other means. If he’s breaking the rules CCP needs to act accordingly and set an example. I don’t care what alliance he’s in- neither should the EULA rules. 
---
&gt;circumstantial
---
Lmfao can I have what you’re smokin mate it seems to be quite dank
---
It's rather ironic that there are so many people defending him. Hypocrites.
---
I don’t think you realize how common this is, it’s like a posting a pic of your first 1b+ in a dedsite
---
Anom spawns are a tiny part of what makes delve such a powerhouse of economic growth. I neither rat nor mine anymore, just invent, build and trade. 
---
We cycle ore anoms with the ochre rule. If there's ochre you can't mine anything else but ochre, or be DD'd, so belts cycle even with 5 hour colossal respawn time. 
---
Smaller groups that can't cycle belts effectively because of low rorq numbers just get boned if the anoms don't respawn by themselves as fast as they do (4 days I believe). 
---
With ratting anoms tons of supers can still make isk by just undocking whenever they log on and cycling through the less than ideal sites, because the risk is so low when we have such a huge response to drop on any threat. 
---
The rock havens are ideal sites with max ticks, but given the safety of delve people would just undock and rat whatever is left and still make decent ticks. Plus their isk buys cheap delve hulls. 
---
Meanwhile the smaller groups would be boned with slower ideal site respawn, because they could perhaps only have the ability to rat a few hours a day and if it happens to be unsafe at that time they can't. And if the anom respawns suddenly make only one super able to effectively rat with good income per good true-sec system, then many won't bother anymore because its too high risk for too little reward (too bad ticks). That or they'll start running VNIs/myrmidons with multiboxing setups, and then the small guy becomes big and the remaining small guys get boned. 
---
And if it was a scaling thing so that anoms slowed respawn the more you ratted the small guys would be especially boned, because they can't just uproot and move elsewhere to let their home get anoms back. Meanwhile goons could easily just move our supercap umbrella to south delve for a while, then maybe fountain, then back to delve again. We already sort of do that with rorquals by moving our supercap umbrella and 300+ rorquals to a different region to hit all the good moons there (or well technically I think its about half the good moons each time) in a 3 hour period. 
---
I think you should give it some more thought and think up twenty other options instead of fixating on some of the first ideas you come across, if the first most obvious ideas were any good they'd have been done already. 
---
Fair warning you're gay 
---
You can definitely mess with the economy solo, but it takes a while to build up knowledge and resources. Might as well start by learning in an open group!
---
Why just the goon botters?
---
Well? Are they?
---
That guy again
---
lol no. 
---
Uh yeah you only have evidence of the dude using multi imput whatever to give him a gameplay advantage in...chatting in more than one chatroom at once...? Yeah no.
---
&gt;I'd much prefer that you undock something and we slug it out. But you don't do that.
---
But we do undock in something and slug it out. But the core of your complaint is that we should pull punches to give you a fairer fight. Why?
---
"you don't know what you are talking about" is not a suitable defense for why you should not have to adapt.

Alpha clone exploration is basically just exploration with a T1 Frigate like a Heron. You don't get the defensive capabilities of a cloaking device, so it's a lot riskier but you still get the probe launcher, and the data and relic analyzers. If you fly smart you'll still be hard to catch, and if you learn the data and relic game you don't need omega skills or mods to hack cans reliably.

Ansiblex gates don't work in systems without upgraded infrastructure hubs. You can't make a gate between NPC null and lowsec.

Fact

2nd this. 
---
Scamming new players and impersonating CCP are both bannable (the new player thing is wonky. But impersonating a gm trying to help them would probably qualify) 
---
Lol if you think input broadcasting into a chest is somehow cheating
---
Are you ok?
---
Anyone got a link to that one bad ass with all the kills in a Venture?
---
lmfao
---
Dreddit is recruiting!
---
They should make them anti-interceptors. So basically one would be for tackle and one would be for breaking tackle. This way they are in constant competition nwith each other and we just let the dog fights proceed. 
---
&gt; Meanwhile the smaller groups would be boned with slower ideal site respawn, because they could perhaps only have the ability to rat a few hours a day and if it happens to be unsafe at that time they can't.
---
Shock horror. Imagine, not being able to do your preferred activity in dangerous nullsec because it's too dangerous. You are also overlooking that the smaller groups will have fewer people running sites. Finally, there really aren't all that many smaller groups around anymore that aren't under someone else's umbrella. I doubt this change would fundamentally alter that.
---
You can certainly get a lot out of ships with abyssal modules.  It's important to remember, at the smallest scale, this power inflation has largely been offset by the removal of off grid links several years ago.  Most abyssal ships in a solo/micro setting are just now getting back to the power afforded by off grid links, with much greater risk.  It's pretty common these days to use a command destroyer alt for some links, but it's still a pale shadow of what OGLs used to offer.
---
At the other end of the spectrum, abyssals are really just providing better tackle mods, and I wouldn't say they've had an overwhelming effect on doctrines overall.  Leshaks have seen some fleet use.  We'll have to see if that continues to scale up, and if they keep being fielded once the novelty wears off.  The Kiki and Drek are both excellent small scale ships, but I doubt they'll scale up to larger doctrinal use just do to cost efficiencies vs the other best ships in class.  For example, a jackdaw fleet will whup Kikis all day due to projection, and I doubt Dreks will trade very well vs massed hurricanes or ferox.

Now THAT would be publicity for the game.

^especially if it was Mittani's wizard hat
---
I need life alert apparently starting tomorrow.  
---
It is against the rules though... 
---
For SCIENCE
---
I would say there are about 10 to 15 players in the Tacoma area. I am planning the March meet up to be in Tacoma.

We had *a* supercap umbrella but not to the extent that exists now.

How about instead of putting less money into the game, CCP were to find a way to encourage more risk and more PVP?  Tackle it from the "sink" end, not the "faucet" end of the problem.
---
&gt; input broadcasting in and of itself isn't against the rules

---
I guess chat is absent from that list otherwise all the Jita scams and spam advertising would fall under it.
---
i'm cool with that
---
We can't. That's presumption of guilt before being proven. 
---
I do it all the time to mess with people. 
---
HAha. I read your post but I honestly don't remember any podcasts where people fought, and I've listened to them all... for years. I only remember one fight on podside with Ralph or something...  Anyway. We're historians/reporters so fighting guests doesn't work when you re trying to get real answers.
---
Thanks for thinking we're polished because... holy hell, its a mess of loose wires behind TIS.
---
&gt;...  This issue is conpounded by the sinple fact that the industry trend in videogames is to maximize $/player rather than number of players, player satiafaction, demographic diversity, and so on.   
---
Boom. Funny thing about this game unlike others, is how reliant it is on having a universe full of people to fight to be worth playing.   
---
Having a small percentage of wallet warriors isn't replacing the content/interaction that the rest of the universe needs to be *livable/fun*.
---
I run abyss almost entirely for my pve recently. It's a lot of fun and the random nature of the drops gives it a loot feeling that missions don't. As for how balanced it is and the mod aspect of it you have to understand that the risk of destroying an expensive item is far higher than making it much better, and even in that instance where you do improve it markedly there are ceilings to the improvement, you won't turn a medium size item into a large equivalent or small to medium etc. It doesn't create win items, just improved versions of that item if you are lucky. 
---
I think the most they get used in PVP where it matters is only in abyss pvp where most players are rocking mutated shit. So 1v1 it can make a difference, more than that and it's unlikely to make a huge difference beyond pilot skill in fitting and engaging.
---
I'm Also willing to be it is a large isk sink for some players who need more sinks anyway. Hard to calculate without the probability numbers that CCP has but more people pissing away isk is definitely something we need more of.  
---
Basically I love it, people always freak out on the internet, it wasn't warranted. Bigger problems are cap proliferation and too many isk faucets not enough sinks. Panic about that if you wanna panic.
---
Afraid you’d try and talk to them
---
No they just don’t spawn 
---
Are you seriously trying to argue that he set up input broadcasting only to use it for chat?
---
That's really sad.
---
I sincerely do not want a good content creator to be banned. 
---
If it's really bothering you why not try to bait him, then counterplay? Create some explosions for everyone to enjoy.
---
&lt;Slaps forehead&gt;
---
It’s not going to happen he won’t bend the knee too you, infact if he does I’ll give u everything I own.
---
Right, because Goons weren't krabbing furiously in Fortress Deklein pre-rorqs :thonking:
---
over 1 trillion isk/month from highsec market taxes
---
Wasnt it said that you can use input broadcasting for ui purposes? I'm sure they have the tools to distinguish between that and using it for illegally.
---
Playing solo will burn you out if you're doing the same activities without the spice of friends. Even PVE, or mining stuff, which usually bores me to death, is doable when you have someone to chit chat with while you do it.
---
Scale that to PVP, and it's so much fun. Eve isn't about the ships you fly, but the people you fly with.
---
I’m glad you liked it man! I was worried I went a litttle too personal lol
---
Exactly, its painfully obvious this is what they're doing
---
Silently watch these posts every few days but can’t help but be baited into wondering if they are all troll posts or the op thinks they are the first to see it
---
Good bot
---
Signal Cartel has an AI that's cuter anyways.
---
Are you sure about that? Because I am 99.99999% sure that Cpt_Soban is not a bot.

I believe this guy has an army of AFK cloakers. Please explain how input broadcasting gives him an *unfair advantage* while AFK cloaking. I'd guess he uses it to save his finger from manually logging in his characters.

This guys surely knows the secrets of wh space

Well I don't know about you but I'm read to find out.

Honestly, you can chat with your newbie corp when you get in the game and I made contacts there that I still use a year later. Plus there are plenty of public channels for specific playstyles, such as EvE-Scout with exploration of all flavors, that are open to all regardless of corp affiliation. 
---
Nobody truly flies solo. All it takes it a bit of typing and a willingness to make friends, and you're golden.
---
Will CCP bring back the lore dictionary and jukebox?
---
Isn't there a note regarding player interaction in the rule stipulating bottling and input broadcasting? 
---
Shouldn't matter either way, it still breaks EULA, as it's bottling/automating player interaction activity 
---
What, like an arrow?
---
Literally the most terrifying down there
---
You're*

Question.. why do you need to anchor your own structures? There should already be refineries and keepstars in place. 
---
End of the day, if you want the spoils of nullsec then you need to contribute to the greater cause wherever you end up living. 
---
Otherwise, see if Spacemonkey alliance is still a thing.. I'm sure they need people,they struggled to get initial SOV last I checked.
---
So... a pet of a gewn pet?
---
You do know wormholes also have a limit by ship class not just mass, right? Supers and titans are not allowed in wormholes at all.
---
Nope, because all those bugs and more will pop right back up when they drop new content 
---
For the alliance then, good
---
yeah, i solo T1's  with a bling'd out Manticore just to see if it could be done.
---
Horde and GOTG were at war like less than a month ago dumb dinoposter.
---
This post made me contract lymphoma.

What you shouldn't have done is paint every CSM member with the same brush.

He says at 3:25 in big white letters "Multibox Drake Calvalry has arrived" 
---
I always found the dust stuff underwhelming. Even frigate weapons come close to city busting levels in my mind
---
Do they? I hope they do but I lose faith in CCP with every new weekly bot scandal
---
It still needs to be done the proper way. Posting on reddit is not the proper way. The GM team isn't reading reddit. 
---
So, once again, you are arguing that he went through the effort to set up input broadcasting, but *only for chat*.  
---
And you are also arguing going through that effort was useless.
---
Out of curiosity, how do you feel about QAnon?
---
It's incriminating enough to reverse the burden of proof. We know he doesnt use it for chatting. This is an obvious ban. Anything else means CCP protects him and we have a new t20.
---
Clearly you don't know anything about Shiva
---
Whats shipping? Still about what this already way overprized tee costs?
---
posting this thread every day would be idiotic and should be removed.
---
Pm me the video please
---
&gt; We know he doesnt use it for chatting.
---
We don't know that. We also don't know if he wasn't using it to arrange windows, forgot he had it on, and went to shittalk in local. 
---
&gt; Anything else means CCP protects him and we have a new t20.  
---
We already got it when CCP Peligro initially banned input broadcasting because he got buttfucked by a boxer in a JF and then "REEE'd" at the CEO. Nobody gave a shit then because you we all too busy whining about how hard it is to F1 monkey and not get bombed by a competent group because you refused to bring any support ships. 
---
so he should be free to break rules then? Don't be a retard
---
Cheers :)

I filed a ticket, and attached relevant information.

&gt;you posted.

Pandemic Horde Inc.
---
And since they are mods they can do that.If I had to put up with this daily bullshit and autism we produce, I'd ban people occasionally "for lulz" too
---
I m actually not that sure bout the last part.
---
The one thing I like about abyssal space over anything else is that I think high tier sites are impossible to bot, since they are always different and if the ships are not killed in the correct order or if maneuvering is not done correctly death will come quickly and expensively. 
---
The abyssal module market has dried up significantly recently as most of the people who want seriously expensive god modules have them. Unless there is an announcement regarding the use of abyssal mods on ships for the AT, I think this market will only continue to weaken. I personally feel the future of abyssal mods will not be top tier mods, but super compact/low fitting stuff to allow for fits that were previously impossible, and cheaply rolled T2 mods that grants improved performance without going up to the cost of faction, which in some cases can be 10-20x the price of the T2 mods.
---
We don't know either don't worry.(and nor does ccp)
---
No I'm saying that's all you have proof for.
---
Feels good fam. My web is pretty good at 17.87km. However I prefer my Curse that has an abyssaled faction heavy neut. 100km neut range and I actually have a fit on the thing. 
---
&gt; impossible to bot
---
oh haha you sweet summer child
---
give me some capable botting software and I could write the code myself for a T4 Sac bot in a day
---
&gt; super compact
---
I mean this isn't exclusive to high stats. One of the things I don't like about mutaplasmids is that unlike literally every other module and rig there's no real performance cost to them; it's possible to roll no drawbacks, and better performance doesnt create heavier fitting.
---
Also that's a good example of why bling scales better. If you can roll T2, the guy who can roll As and Xs at the same rate is going to get better modules because of better source material. Even if you can get a flawless roll, he will have a whole range of results that are as good or better.
---
One of the big things holding back the widespeard use of abyssal stuff is the lack of a good way to buy and sell modules. Currently its contracts only, and its hard to peruse those for one with the stats you need. There is a 3rd party site (mutaplasmid.space), an in game channel , and a discord for trading, but this is all out of the lack of in-game support.
---
Lots of galaxies have a north.
---
I have a pair of 16.8km matching webs on my Rapier currently, and they can hit 117k with boosts, heat, and a 5% implant. I'm working on a doctrine that will pair this with a CD and a dread for PVP, or just rapier + dread for PVE testing. 
---
CCP Thinks so :)
---
There is a balance to be had. Solo is a chill experience but social is far more rewarding. The social side of the game has produced many friends. Some who I have met in person, another flew me across country, and then there was the time I got a job offer at a start up. Dive into the adventure and see where it leads.
---
I've also made a lot of enemies and enjoyed many tears. My recent favorite was that while killing an orca the guy was screaming at his computer so bad that he traumatized his young daughter who was then afraid of him for several days. Which made him more mad at me. Point in case make sure you have some balance it is a game.
---
You don't need support for a ratting dread, just proper fit+tactics. A fun PVP combo is a bonused web vindi, to make an anti-cap fit dread track. Lussy Lou featured this in a video and its magical to see heavily tanked battleships melt. https://youtu.be/X57Chl-WCUU
---
Who would dare downvote this?
---
Its a good enough reason for CCP to investigate him for illegal input broadcasting, not to ban him. Thats what it means with circumstatial. You have evidence of him having it set up, not of him using it illegally.
---
being annoying spam?
---
While it's interesting to hear your perspective as someone who runs a lot of abyss, I feel like your commentary on the PvP aspects is a bit unqualified... there are several aspects of your post which maybe I'm misreading but seem to say you dont have much experience with PvP.
---
* Larger = winning. Do you think that generally battleships beat frigates or something? Or that equipping the largest size equipment is how to go?
---
* You don't seem to understand the effect that even small percentage increases in stats can have. Have you ever fought solo/smallgang in the era of offgrid links?
---
Change your playstyle. Sometimes playstyles become unviable or unfun, in which case it's time for them to die. It's unfortunate but it does happen due either to shifting meta or mechanics changes.
---
CCP and the targets you want to harass should not bend the knee to preserve your way of life nor anyones in EVE. That's how the game goes down the "turning to mush" route as it opens up to try and cater to everyone.
---
If you can't find anything else to do in the game and end up unsubbing please know i feel for you. Because that's the position i'm in in relation to world of warcraft as a protection warrior who loves running M+. But it's not right to ask others to sacrifice their enjoyment of the game so you can have some more of yours.
---
&gt;We don't know that. We also don't know if he wasn't using it to arrange windows, forgot he had it on, and went to shittalk in local. 
---
There is no chance anybody not protecting him would consider any of those. How do you know he didnt use it for playing?
---
&gt;We already got it 
---
Then that is the narrative that should be used in relation to botting. No more fucking "ccp makes money off of botters subs" (which they dont). t20 was providing active help to certain players. Now CCP is providing passive help. This is an internal affairs issue. Clearly some devs are interfering in the game by selectively refusing to enforce the EULA. The entire company is basically shit.
---
I wonder if we can find the day in the produced/destroyed graph where Triumvirate jumped their super fleet to a fortizar....
---
parked a sabre in their space for like a week and received no less than 4 death threats btw
---
Pandemic Hoard or eve uni (brave as well but no personal experience)
---
These will jump-start new players, you get skill books and ships for free. Many fleets at all times of the day, you will quickly learn what you enjoy to do. When you know what you enjoy, you may choose to leave for a more specialist corp.
---
Voice Coms is almost always needed when playing with others.
---
I believe he has something like a hundred accounts he logs in every day. I'd imagine he uses input broadcasting to streamline this process. I just don't see how input broadcasting gives an *unfair* advantage to an AFK cloaker. 
---
&gt; There is no chance anybody not protecting him would consider any of those. How do you know he didnt use it for playing?
---
Because I believe in innocent until proven guilty. Gaara was proven guilty when the moron lit 20+ cynos at once and hit panic on 20 alts. This guy has not been proven guilty of using input broadcasting in a banned situation. 
---
&gt; Then that is the narrative that should be used in relation to botting. The entire company is basically shit.
---
Welcome to TYOOL 2014+5. 
---
Weird... I have been gone for a while. When did this happen? The screwing thing and the what would assault frigates be previously used?
---
No, he needs to face consequences, CCP informed public shaming with the capital to hi-sec execution thing.
---
The rules need to be enforced, or things will break down, It’s insulting if it’s not.
---
You made this post because you are at least subconsciously starting to recognise that the same garbage outrage culture that infects social media and used by SJWs is starting to creep into normie gamers. They form an online mob of NPCs and pressure a company into doing something they want to another person.
---
Its pathetic and sad.
---
I know you can rat with HAWs. I was thinking about ratting with an XL gun dread and using the rapier for webs for shits n giggles.   
---
That video just made me cream myself. I need to do that. 
---
I joined Brave when I first started, learned a bunch, and have been solo since then. I do ok.
---
Very cool. Do you want a lonely Norwegian? I’m nice ok?
---
I wonder if anyone will ever rip and post the Abyssal Deadspace music tracks on youtube.
---
To get 6k dps on a sieged dread you'd have to have the dread and capital gun skills at level 1 while using damage mods with negative muta rolls. A decent fit revelation does 75,000 volley damage every 6 seconds. 
---
yes I have to 2, and I know frigs can kill shit fit battleships. I have plenty of PVP experience. I guess I could do a better job by saying the mutas won't change fleet doctrines, they won't imbalance fleet warfare, and thus they won't break the games pvp since small//solo pvp is sadly rare and larger groups determine the course of the economy, not small groups or solo fights.
---
They don’t have goldfish memories: they have one track minds so intent on validating their opinion they skip over facts.
---
hi friend since you're new here i am just going to let you in out a little secret - it's best to not know xenuria, or read what xenuria says, or listen to his videos. frankly just avoid xenuria.
---
have a good day
---
What if they had some sort of chaff or flares that only combat interceptors could fit? That would be kinda cool. Like they can still get hit if you have good enough tracking as usual with guns but they could take considerably less damage from RLML with their special chaff/flare-like module?
---
Do you think it is somehow related to such quality posts?
---
I have a space I have available to meetup in Tacoma for that, let me know. I'm down to do one sooner too. I'm on your discord. DM to coordinate. 
---
I have a friend who rats with an anti-cap fit dread. The trick is to just warp in at 100 so all the rats burn at you with 0 transversal. No more tracking problems! And yeah that video is why I gave Lussy Lou a 99% web. I wanted to see just what he could do with it. I have yet to see it featured, unfortunately.
---
Because many of those are bots boss...
---
Why ask him to change his play style when you won’t change your own though?
---
His point that he is making is that small/medium size roams can’t/don’t happen anymore because everyone simple brings in all the firepower they can muster to one shot the group rather than fight on fair terms. There are a large group of players who enjoy the small scale warfare of this game which is becoming very few and far between. 
---
As for the last part, having anyone unsub isn’t going to be good for the game, because the more that leave the less that happens in the game, which means your capital warfare won’t exist anymore either.
---
Why don't you join Pandemic Horde or something? Why are you having trouble getting with a big group?
---
You might have edited it just before I commented. 
---
'tis correct now. 
---
I didnt just see "yeet"... did I? Jesus fuck me.

Swedes and Norwegians have no problems understanding each other, so we would welcome our brothers from the west to join us! Btw love skiing in Norway; Skeikampen, Lillehammer/Kvittfjell, Trysil - wonderful places all of them!

You are more than welcome to visit our corp recruitment channel, check "info" on Svea Rike in-game for a link, or go directly to the chat "SR Recruit" (without the " ). 
---
I should warn you that we have rather high requirements on skills and experience, and that even if you pass our corp-recruitment process, you still have the NC. alliance recruitment process left including the need for one or more vouches from NC-players that know you, and it can be rather "harsh" in general in the forums there - it's part of the "test" ;)

But please visit us, and we'll talk!

Not likely.

I'm pretty sure an EVE-crowdfunding would fix that - and everyone in EVE would pitch in, since everyone want's the Stain shiptoasts to end.

Trick with HAW was to warp at 70. What rats are you facing?

They used to individually convo people many many years ago now, I spoke to a few when I made alts. Glad to see they're doing it again.

So you want new ships with new stats to replace old ships but keep the same visual appearances?
---
It's a smoking gun. I've seen him operate his bombers, he clearly uses something to control all of them.
---
Would this be sufficient to get him banned in-game?
---
If it makes you feel any better, I thought my last booster expired today.  Oops :-/
---
&gt; Do you have any data on the new jump gate usage or lo burn?
---
from what I saw yesterday reading the scrollback on our internal comms from our logistics folk... it's way up, like very much up. that lack of fatigue seems to have really made a big difference to how people use them.
---
"buy skins dumb virgin" -- Pearl Abyss
---
&gt; people would have to move around in order to keep running sites.
---
or they'd log out and go and play another game instead.
---
i know that'd be my answer. I'd treat a finite number of sites like daily quests in other games. i'd hit my quota of daily quests then log out and do something fun other than jumping 15 jumps to find a site that hasn't been emptied out.
---
&gt;Because I believe in innocent until proven guilty.
---
Do you understand the concept of burden of proof? This is not a criminal trial. We don't need "beyond reasonable doubt".
---
&gt;Gaara was proven guilty when the moron lit 20+ cynos at once and hit panic on 20 alts.
---
When was he banned? Do you have a link to the banning?
---
&gt;This guy has not been proven guilty of using input broadcasting in a banned situation. 
---
What reason is there to believe he does not use this in game play?
---
&gt;Welcome to TYOOL 2014+5. 
---
What?

Pretty much every botting thread only deals with "ccp makes money off of subs" or "CCP doesnt care". I havent seen any indication the community believes CCP is protecting some players.

You undock in a fleet that he said can't be beaten without bringing a ton of caps into range, which would be noticed and countered.
---
You can't see how to beat it yourself can you? 
---
Explain to me the advantage of input broadcasting on cloaky campers then, please?
---
It's not like he's running 20+ characters at the same time, all doing the same thing, in the same area. That's obviously helpful when you have 5+ Rorquals in a belt mining, but how does one use an input broadcast for an advantage on cloaky campers?
---
You have proof he used it in chat. That isn't against the TOS as far as I'm aware. Until CCP makes some response or someone provides more proof, **this is nothing more than a witch hunt**, and it's pretty obvious why mar5hy is a threat to them. His cloaky campers are the only real "counter" to the STUPID AS FUCK design of having local chat/intel programs linked to monitoring local.
---
sue Abbott ate paint chips as a kid
---
Got proof he did it in more then chat? Otherwise no rule was broken. Check the ToS again...
---
A lot of them never try small gang shit. It's not surprising they simply drop supers and titans. If they don't know that small gang is fun, why would they bring it when they just want their killboard to look good? 
---
Ah I see. Do you have any fits that u could recommend?
---
This gives a feeling that CCP considers Eve legacy code and it’s just trying to cut costs and milk it for whatever’s worth before people stopping playing reaches critical mass and the game fail cascades, and they are using their resources on mobile games and whatnot. I’m not saying that’s what CCP thinks or what’s going to happen but not fixing for so long serious basic issues like local, that’s the impression it gives. I’d say to CCP that whether it’s true or not the game is done for, that’s not the impression you want to give.
---
I have not done the ratting, it was a friend. And yeah wormhole space is about the only area where face brawling still happens, everywhere else the ships would likely stay too far away.
---
That’s exactly what dev departments do when the bugs become a big problems. A couple of iterations of stability, refactoring and bug fixing. It’s commonly called “paying the technical debt”.
---
Is it not patently fucking obvious? You don't think there is a clear gameplay advantage when he logs in 100 characters and are able to cloak them all simultaneously on the same server tick?
---
Because he's using input broadcasting to log in 100 toons and then cloak them at the same time. 
---
What he really meant to say was that he pyfa warriored something up and now thinks it can take on the world.
---
How much does a supercap umbrella cost?
---
Is it a wizard hat? 
---
And how is that working out for you?
---
teamwork, it's one hell of a force multiplier.
---
maybe if everyone outside of imperial legacy gave it a real go - that 60% would be able to surpass the 40%. 
---
The end is nigh!
---
Solid reporting, appears legit. 
---
I dunno, I still have a hulltanked Blaster 'Ranis and it's still a great, cheap and fast package to land that scram on kiting ships with after the fleet ceptor gets point.
---
How do you know he hasn’t? Do you know if CCP has issued a warning to him already?
---
Coming from holesale, disturbing 
---
No, not goon bots/input broadcasts! They are paying customers!!
---
Also no INIT Bots too, cuz it's not cool.
---
Come on that's bad logical falacy right there ...
---
you can use it for windows management AFAIK, so you can fit 4 windows on a single 1080 screen, but you can't use DXNothing windows that just show parts of the UI. It cannot automate anything for you. 1 click, 1 action, no scroll through macros. It has to be the unadulterated full eve experience for each logged in character. 
---
Sphere.exe 
---
Consequences for what?! For input broadcasting in a chat? This goes to my primary point. If he is doing it in some game breaking way - certaintly CCP should do something. However, for this type of “wrong” certainly just a little warning would do. Nothing even official. Show CCP issue a public announcement ever time someone is sanctioned? Otherwise, this post is meaningless. In-game reports. Not reddit posts! 
---
Lmao. Well, obviously you were banned because you were a Goon. We all know that is different.
---
riveting
---
Can't control Sue. He's a freebird. I just let him spread his wings and fly.
---
I can say from experience that abyssal mats (iso10/condensate) are still coming down in price although it seems like the lower bottom will be in the 90k-120k per unit. Condensate has consistently been that for a long time and iso10 is on its way there steadily but slowly.
---
&gt;when he logs in 100 characters and are able to cloak them all simultaneously
---
That makes sense as a reason for using it, sure, hadn't considered that...so now we're left with someone providing proof that that's actually what's happening here, right? At the moment, we only have proof that he used it in chat, which as far as I'm aware, isn't against the TOS?
---
As a multiboxer who follows the EULA and just lines up accounts in window'ed mode across a couple monitors; I agree. I gave up weeks of work of tweaking ISBoxer and DXNothing. If I can follow the rules post change, so can they. 
---
Not that i am keeping sides with Xenuria the psychological weapon of mass brain cell destruction. but. in general in its not good to bet your everything on another man's actions. As unlikely as it seems.
---
Worse even, you gave Xenuria something to keep you up to. Brrr, oh you poor poor soul.
---
What is plex? I am coming back from almost 8 years hiatus and back then plex was fairly new and just 30 days of game that could be sold in-game or even stolen in-game.
---
Now I see that it is a micro transaction currency? What does it change for me? 
---
I've seen him doing bomb runs with his toons.
---
It's almost like citizens in the US are seeing what is like for the rest of the world where people get chased for breaking US copyright laws
---
I mean, have you ever seen him move his accounts from one region to another? I have. It's pretty fucking obvious how that's benefitted via input broadcasting. It's pretty obvious how hitting f1 for cloak on one client and it going out to 20+ on the instant is pretty obvious. 
---
&gt;And a supercap umbrella from 3 staging systems is not an improvement
---
Yes it is. It is an *improvement*. And maybe together with other *improvements* it might actually lead to a solution.
---
CCP has been waffling on these issues for literal years now looking for some Jesus change that's going to fix everything. It doesn't exist. 
---
source or GTFO.
---
And be sure to READ the source if you link it : All the official statement allow input broadcasting in a way or another.

&gt; You made this post because you are at least subconsciously starting to recognise that the same garbage outrage culture that infects social media and used by SJWs is starting to creep into normie gamers.

delve, cloud ring and querious already exist, fade was a walk in the park, that's 4 right there, put some effort in and we have deklein or pure blind, conquerors choice, that makes 5.

And then someone steals the mats and build the Keepstar instead before it dies on anchoring because all of eve wants in on the killmail.

it is not though … 
---
you're right, input broadcasting is not forbidden by itself.
---
Revenge? Nah man, it's about enforcing a rule. You know what happens if he doesn't get punished for input broadcasting? More people will start using it. It's simple as that.
---
&gt; that's what the rules say.
---
No they don't.
---
Not sure why you were downvoted. There several streamers that were banned on stream when they were shown to be just using DXNothing windows.

What is a fictional group in the context of data? Is the server that this group's website hosted on purely hypothetical? I assume that the database containing user information is also fictional? 
---
Obviously those are both absurd things to say, but that is essentially what you are saying. If you run a website that has collected information about who uses it then you are going to be subject to GDPR. That is why a lot of US websites blocked access to EU citizens, because they wanted to try and mitigate this. 
---
One of the BB FCs. He and a army of bombers and he was caught doing input broadcasting by typing in a chat.
---
Yeah I'm doing good thanks! Hope you're well too.

Haven't been playing much Eve recently, just don't have the time like I used to. Thinking of going on the Waffles public roam on Thursday to get some nostalgia though.

You know the sad part is that that ratio isn't even enough to really put a dent in Goons. You would have to ramp that up by a factor of 50 just to be equal to how much is being produced.
---
expect it's not
---
It's not breaking the eula.
---
It's not botting nor automating interaction.
---
so please, fuck off.
---
it's never incriminating enough to reverse thee burden of proof.
---
If you don't have proof, he is not guilty. NEVER.
---
Dont normalise lynch mobs. Due process in everything.
---
I went one further Mine are \*\*\*\*\*01 \*\*\*\*\*02 \*\*\*\*\*03 etc. Looking back, I'd choose a different naming scheme as it has brought grief until people actually see that they are individually controlled, but it's not hard to have multiple windows open in window'ed mode if you have multiple monitors. For pvp/logi, I wouldn't do more than 2 per monitor, but for mining 4-5 is comfortable. You just have to get into the habit of clicking the windows in order, back and forth so they stack like a set of laid out cards. 
---
But it is automating interaction, it's a chat channel, used to interact with other fucking players, please tell me how it is NOT automating interaction
---
Yeah, that was always cool
---
&gt;We don't need "beyond reasonable doubt".
---
Good thing is you are not the judge here. You are only a dumb kid.
---
CCP on the other hand does need it. So, he is innocent until proven guilty.
---
and if CP has no proof of him being guilty of a bannable offence, then he won't get banned. And you will keep crying all along, it won't change a thing. The day retard kid will make player get banned in eve is the day eve dies.
---
more like illiterally unplayable

Please put up the evidence you claim to have or shut up ... obvious trolling and needless posting :(

You can still use plex to buy game time (500 plex for a month). The plex can still be sold and bought in market and it's used as a currency in new eden store, where you buy game time, cosmetics, skill extractors and multiple pilot training licencies for example. Also plex can still be stolen via scams or by destroying someone who hauls it, but they've introduced a plex vault, which is account specific storage for your plex. When the plex is stored there it moves around with you and doesn't get dropped/destroyed if you get blown up. So basically no-one should be hauling plex that can drop or be destroyed if blown up. But sone players are dumb and others might keep them in cargo to bait highsec gankers/cargi scanners. 
---
I cant tell of pl not reaching damage cap is satire or real life. What a sad state.

It does make you wonder what position in management is responsible for taking the Abyss, the product of so many peoples excellent work and literally tying it's success to having a reliable and stable client, local, and global infrastructure, which it absolutely doesn't.
---
I am sure that "succeed or die" sounded great to the marketing and management wonks, but it is a poor choice if every time a ship is lost, every disconnect,through no fault of their own, players hate against the company just grows..
---
I WANT to do this content, I also want to do the events, but with the choices and lack of effort in the events, and the appallingly bad 'death mechanic' in the abyss I really cannot get the will to more than update my skill queue every month or so, and why am I even bothering to do that?

I won't say eve is dying, But I am afraid it is for me, management choice by management choice/lack of thought.

I have been trying to get Valk to name a structure after me since I joined SPVG, only to be let down over and over again.  It was a deeply sad situation.

what he means is, "you can't expect to get answers/action from the GM team when you post on reddit, while they have to react to tickets".
---
\&gt;  Sue said, “I krabbed my ass off today in Oijanen with my Rattlesnake to buy an Astra because I’ve never had one named after myself, so I gated to Jita, bought it and anchored one 1100km off the BWF gate. No one even knew I did it. ‘sue’s ganking palace.’ I asked my CEO to drop one and he wouldn’t, so I said fuck it and did it from my alt corp.”   
---
Bullshit, Sue can't go 2 words without mispelling 3.

I've been whinning about this mechanics for months now... and this NPC PoV story makes me realize how right I am ! The rats agro switch makes it even safer to be the PVE guy.

In case the corp in question was selling ingame stuff for real money, the could be in a position where they were acting commercially.

Cheers!
---
Is it bad that, at first, I thought this was some kind of shit/gudpost about how, since CCP can't fix local, others have (apparently) decided it was necessary to provide a third-party application for 'talking in stations'?
---
Me not, but goons will for the imperium use.          
---
While palatine keepstar have no real value - ability to create this kind of connection let you own twice as much space under same umbrella.

I think they use asic miners these days.

So you support bots/broadcasters. Why should anybody care what a botter thinks?

&gt;CCP on the other hand does need it. So, he is innocent until proven guilty.

They already have it. They can do whatever they want. They can likely even change the EULA.
---
&gt;and if CP has no proof of him being guilty of a bannable offence
---
We have enough proof.
---
&gt;then he won't get banned.
---
Hes not going to get banned because they protect him.

do they even have enough devs these days for that to happen?

yes i am sure that the guy using many multi boxed cloaky alts only uses his input broadcasting for chat .... Does anyone actually use input broadcasting for chat? what benefit would you get for having 15 or so accounts all say the same thing on the same server tick .... stop blindly defending something just because for once the circle jerk is about someone you like. 
---
&gt;it's never incriminating enough to reverse thee burden of proof.

Then he just gets banned.

&gt;If you don't have proof, he is not guilty. NEVER.

Wow ma, we made it! Reddit famous!

yeah cmon guys this guy only uses input broadcasting to send the same message on like 10+ clients .... /s

Ok that looks bloody epic.

Dude, you are in a coalition where a fucktard broadcasts like 30 blinged mining barges, don't you have the impression you are bullshiting people ?

Well, now maybe.

But many eve people are quite old and when they started they had time for this as they where much younger then with much less RL commitments.

I’ve gone between solo and big alliances over 10+ years, depending on how much time I have to play. I’ve had just as much fun solo, if not more - hunting in WHs, roaming null and hanging out in faction warfare space. I’d definitely recommend it, it’s not the same game but it’s still hella fun.

Also whole point of this change is to let new groups develop without big blue list - without this list a gate of this kind will not be possible.

Stainguy posts on a metaphysical level. Ya'll just aren't tuned into his wavelength.

"Hi man, why are you avoiding me?"

he also does bombing runs with his alts which is alot easier with input broadcasting

Bans come in waves, they are never instant that evidence is present and investigated. The Goon input broadcasting 60 Rorqs guy was the same and so is every other cheater that gets banned.
---
Notice me senpai!
---
This, also issue is with lack of proper market to sell those items.          
---
Even if you are hundreds worthy modules - there is no way to sell them in proper way.            
---
Which would effectively replace them with T3Cs in one *very* specific role (travel to enemy staging and cloak up on grid), while not doing anything to buff non-nullified ceptors.
---
Fleet ceptors are flown for their speed and bubble immunity, not for the tiny amount of dps you can put into their highs.
---
Obviously anyone caught doing it should..what’s to :thinking: about?

If you want to beat it then plan to beat it. If you don't plan to beat it don't fight with it.

I think the main outcry was due to the addictive nature of the gambling side to rolling mods. I only have one abyssal rolling adict in corp and hes making isk rather than stealing his mums credit card.

That's not an answer.

People go roaming for small gang pvp. They don't go roaming to fight supers.

---
A literal God
---
&gt; Why ask him to change his play style when you won’t change your own though?
---
It's adapt or die, sounds like he wants to die because his only other option is to beg to be fed.
---
&gt;His point that he is making is that small/medium size roams can’t/don’t happen anymore because everyone simple brings in all the firepower they can muster to one shot the group rather than fight on fair terms.
---
Why should the larger group "fight fair" aka pull punches? 
---
&gt;There are a large group of players who enjoy the small scale warfare of this game which is becoming very few and far between.
---
If said group was as large as you profess CCP would probably care about them.
---
&gt;As for the last part, having anyone unsub isn’t going to be good for the game, because the more that leave the less that happens in the game, which means your capital warfare won’t exist anymore either.
---
You seem to think i love cap warfare, i don't. Instead i simply don't care about them. You know what else will kill the game? bending it over to cater to people who want to pull it in every different direction. 
---
What do you think is more damaging to the game? A few people unsubbing because mechanical changes made the way they played unviable. Or turning the game into bland grey mush because you tried to cater to the sum total average of what every individual pulling it in a different direction wanted?
---
And if you want it to go the way he wants what makes what he wants more valuable than what someone else wants? I'm sure there are plenty of people who like cap warfare just as there are people who hate it. Who is right there?
---
(e-) famous people primarily known for non-Eve related things, people who anchor free 250k SP depots next to noob stations and people with a large amount of alts (reasons include industry, skillfarming, cloaky camping and more).
---
An alt corp of sc used to own basicially all of the lowsec pocos, but over the last few months people have slowly been peeling them off. I just kill them and only bother to replace if its on a good planet or one that i would use myself.
---
&gt;  If they don't know that small gang is fun, why would they bring it when they just want their killboard to look good?
---
In my experience "small gang" means you preying on mission runners, ratters and miners and running when standing fleet turns up. I been on the receiving end of them plenty, so i have 0 sympathy for ya'll.
---
If he's doing bombing runs, he deserves the almighty banhammer. That is a perfect example of an unfair advantage from input broadcasting.
---
&gt;response fleet
---
Okay so you bring more dps than their entire fleet, and enough logi to ensure you lose 0 ships.. if you even bring subs. 
---
If you brought another small gang, that would be dope. It's what people used to do; they wanted to pvp, so they'd bring their own small gang, rather than fleet. 
---
Nooblet here.
---
So wait, if I understand correctly then the Goons/Test/Imperium are sitting behind a heavily defended and heavily industrialized area. In that case they must be minting untold ISK and minerals, which enables them to build a huge warchest of potential bribes and a standing fleet second to none.
---
Surely one day then the Goons will embark on a galaxy spanning war of conquest. Sweeping all before them in a maelstrom of overwhelming Goonishness, subjugating all who oppose them under the Goonboot of despair.
---
Otherwise what is the point?
---
and if that conclusion is correct then...
---
How do I sign up to be a goon?
---
yeet
---
&gt; People go roaming for small gang pvp. 
---
"People go roaming to prey on targets that can't fight back and call that pvp. They don't go roaming to get smacked back.
---
&gt;They want to have fun in eve.
---
So do i, and having my shit pushed back into dock isn't any fun.
---
so TEST is getting a reverse demo squad?, instead of bashing shit, the new SIG will be putting shit up everywhere?
---
Can we please stop these?
---
Both are an issue, rorqual even more so that supers IMO but the ledger doesn't really show +10% of mineral mined, whereas it clearly show +10% in *the total isk in the game*
---
I can't see an advantage in logging in 100 characters with input broadcasting over manually alt-tabbed other than convenience, which is hardly *unfair*. As for consolidating intel, I'm not sure how you'd use input broadcasting to help with that. Can you D-scan and copy the result with input broadcasting without the results overwriting each other?
---
Agreed! I'm having the opposite problem, I want to play with others but when I log in and ask Corp/Alliance what's happening? everyone seems more interested in solo ratting or mining or small roams with their clique friends :( I'm told to go off and rat or mine by myself but that's not why I play EVE. I don't know if I'm in the wrong Corp or if this is what EVE is now (just having returned recently). 
---
One thing I love about EVE over other more traditional MMOs is that most activities can be solo or in groups. I had problems with trying to raid/dungeon/whatnot because I have trouble keeping a schedule. So I love with EVE you can just log in, have some fun and log out again.
---
Is there any particular reason why people prefer ratting or mining alone? I assume people want to keep bounty to themselves but wouldn't fleeting up mean twice as fast, twice the sites and twice the fun? So overall you still get the same bounty but have bonus laughs as well?
---
Right. You missed the part where I said small gang pvp. I'd rather fight another small gang - people manually piloting and such, local rep, all the gun stuff.
---
Not small gang versus fleet. That doesn't work. 
---
That sounds terribly dull,^(and isk efficient...)
---
RA SMASH!!!!

That`s accually not a bad idea, i bet a god entrepenour can make the grid and drop the structures for a decent long lasting wall of structure grinds. the pain in having to deal with 50 on grid astras alone... 
---
&gt; Unlike other entities, the goal of protecting the base line members and helping them kill baddies, particularly those that follow some super simple guidelines and fits, comes from the very top to the very bottom of the leadership base.
---
That's literally what every alliance do, most renting alliances even defend their renters because that's daily content generation. That's no top tier organization, you are in the most easiest region to defend and you drop on people, even renters do it but unlike them you always have 20 times more people available to do it.
---
&gt; f we look at the MER delve has a huge amount of shit getting killed
---
Yes because Delve parks a solid third of people in this game, it's like saying the Forge gets the most things destroys, of course it's does ...
---
&gt; Bosuns while I dont really do titans, used carefully and strategically can be a bonus to the little guy.

Yes about how they can be boson landing on every gate or WH. Massive bonus for the little guy right there. Totally not boner killer for roaming ability.

Everyone who uses the eris as a dictor is using it wrong. The proper way to use an eris is for 800 facemelting dps in a ship that the person you are face melting probably has no idea what it is and that you can put 800 dps on it.
---
Damn Tri... doesnt show up to fight 500 hostile chars in a system, beeing a 700 man alliance itself. 
---
A measley 100 nullified frigs with 100dps/ea is still 10k dps. Sure it's not 220dps/ea like before but it's still more than than enough to be a right pain in the ass. Want to nip it in the bud? Delete highslots on nullified frigs. Done. 
---
Very rare cases nonwithstanding, yes.
---
They may however not be owned by the alliance/coalition currently owning (and thus renting out) the space in question, but owned by some previous inhabitant (hostile pocos pose no threat, so you generally only bash them if you actually want to do PI on that planet/system).
---
If you see him login in and cloaking all his alts at the same time, you will know what input broadcasting for cloaky campers is good for...
---
I hope they will never add a Stain gate, but instead remove all missions and content in a "bug" unfixed for years 
---
Well isogen has become progressively rarer because of drop rate tweaks, so I assume it will always be more expensive than the condensate. How much more expensive, I have no idea.
---
By that same logic one could say:
---
"If nerds don't want to spend time and effort to kill it, should they really be allowed to kill it"
---
Slippery argument
---
I think it just moved to the nodes. I'm able to hit 90% of the nodes in a run through in dark sites so Im pulling about as much iso as condensate.

Oh no, the unironic made you form posts have begun, this truly is an invasion isn't it

---
Roosevelt once said: “I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.” 
---
I like this idea. And I dont like way in which you treat your enemies. It hard to believe that you are not "chromosomal deviants" yourselves given that you didn't learned to respect those who bring you content.
---
Having this said - Id rather try to join your enemies - may be they have more dignity (even thou the are not Amarrs by birth) than you.  
---
We remember Jamyl Sarum!
---
Just link them an overview?
---
Because he is mar5hy and provides content? Why should he get special treatment, if TheMitanni did the exact same thing as Mar5shy did, would you be defending him? 
---
I was under the impression when the launcher updates, you often have to re-input all of your accounts information?
---
not related to who he is. We got proof he had a dog, and you say cats are forbidden.
---
And if the mittani did the same thing, he would already have sent goons  a mail "do not report people when they look like botters". Wait …
---
If you think that Ceptor fleets are a problem big enough to warrant a nerf (and not just the chemo doctrine of your choosing), sure.
---
Though even if you think that, removing hardpoints would be a better change - scouting/cyno ceptors definitely do not need to be nerfed/removed.
---
Reported this before it even got released, ccp didn't give a shit
---
depends on what you are mining, if you are mining the good shit ive made close to a billion an hour on jackpots
---
Well if CCP will go hard on just supers, they’ll just hop into rorquals in numbers and nothing will significantly change. We need a complex overhaul of the whole null sec isk making system, and I can agree on that.
---
who?
---
Lol ok sure buddy
---
Why would you anchor it in the first place then ? :thinking:
---
most of the time they adding stufft no1 asked for....and the bad thing is that stuff is useless//in my inner circle we lost at least 50 players in last 2 years due to shit game content,dunno but ppl get bored  of this lack of content...most of the ppl are not f1  fans of big blobs

Never,. Never. I can't live the button-down life like you. I want it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles. Sure, I might offend a few of the bluenoses with my cocky stride and musky odors - oh, I'll never be the darling of the so-called "City Fathers" who cluck their tongues, stroke their beards, and talk about "What's to be done with this kingtut fellow?"

&gt; If you brought another small gang, 
---
You still haven't answered why larger groups should pull their punches like this.
---
&gt; You missed the part where I said small gang pvp. I'd rather fight another small gang
---
But you'll settle for some nice soft blingy ratters though.
---
Not really tho, you can't jump supers throughout it so even if we built one it wouldn't help with moving the umbrella
---
I’m 
---
Yes of course, but first unlike ore prices, bounties don't go down with offer and demand (with ore price it has the issue of lowering every hull price including caps but that's another issue). And yes, of course the issue isn't only with supers, and more with anomalies in general being of too short respawn time and too many of them per system, be it combat or ore anomalies. Although with moon mining it won't change a whole lot ...
---
That's totally fair, though I don't really know where to look for good groups.
---
I was in a similar situation and just started playing again two weeks ago.
---
I joined Pandemic Horde and have been having a blast. There's no entry requirements, you just drop an application and it gets accepted, so it's perfect for dipping your feet in the water again, and it's a newbie alliance, so there's a lot of people around who can answer questions about any new game mechanics that you havent heard about.

join a Wormhole group

go to r/evejobs and look for one in your timezone

You still don't see the point. And I'm not going to argue with a troll.

do i read this right, there is 3 times more production than destruction? what could go wrong...

If you can make a solid case as to why an interceptor needs highslots (especially nullified ones), be my guest. And no, cyno doesn't count. That's what t2 cruisers are for. #changemymind

I'm not trolling, i know that its more fun to be on the winning side than the curb stomped side. Which is exactly why i don't sympathize with you.

&gt; True story.

Not once in the last 2 years or so. The launcher has been stable and fine for me with occasional token issues but the account always stay 
---
See, you find it more fun to bring a fleet. As long as you can say you won, even if you did nothing except f1, you're happy.  That's cool. 
---
I prefer to actually play the game - pilot my ship, make decisions, do things. I find that fun. 
---
Have fun you sad bastard.
---
Just let us in! :@  ha 
---
They don't spawn, you need to stretch until it fits one day. 
---
you can solo, and you should join a group because you need to learn. If anything and if you are as antisocial as napoleon dynamite having access to your groups training material is important. players who refuse to admit they are not the hot shit they think they are and stay solo mining in hi sec end up ragequitting.

Holy shit man we are so done for!! I hope you don't release screenshots of us going fuck brave and warped too.... We may have to join winter Co at this rate. WTB SOV!!

Eating mittani's hat aka skill injection.

The person in question used input broadcasting but did not violate the only rule against it:
---
&gt; 6.3. You may not use your own or any third-party software, macros or other stored rapid keystrokes or other patterns of play that facilitate acquisition of items, currency, objects, character attributes, rank or status at an accelerated rate when compared with ordinary Game play.
---
They should be investigated to see if they have used it to cheat, and they quite likely have, but as it stands there is no evidence, just reason for suspicion.
---
Gobbins is all right tbf.  Ive met alot of sperg induced window licking special ed mothers basement types since starting this game long ago.
---
He actually seems pretty normal.
---
Politics aside of course.
---
I haven't played for four years and came back two  weeks ago, can I please have all the SP and giveaway rewards that I missed in those four years? I had irl, you understand.
---
That's your opinion. I can tell you 100% certainty that that is not what investors are interested in, they want $$ no matter if it comes from a few thousands wales or a few hundred thousands nerds. sadly the latter is dying out
---
Two injectors aren't a whole lot to set up a new way of making isk, you probably should work ton improve your combat skill (drone skills for example), so that you make a bit more. Industry demand a variety of things that could be a pain, from finding supply or getting it yourself (so a whole bunch of SP to put into mining and hauling), generally spending time finding a market and a items worth producing, and places to do all that. It really all depends really.

Good job Panfam to win a timer in a system 1 jump from your home, it's not like you are fighting southern alliance anyway

Thats cool :) I love niche stuff like this is still in eve.. Just think that theres room for more of it
---
That was a good entertaining morning read. Now for a poo. 
---
CCP introduced a dumb sov and then was not happy with people using combat ceptors to take part in sov warfare because the point was to have more small fleets contesting instead of a big, fast one. Therefore they decided to nerf the combat ceptors into the ground. Stupidity causes stupidity. Who knew.
---
Thanks! Ill have a listen!

I remember SirMolle, and also his famous danish summer grillpartys although i was to young to attend back then :)

Certain meta mods, (weapons, repair mods, cap boosters come to mind), \*don't\* use this new, consistently named meta system yet. Instead these types are on meta tiers of very small increments squeezed between Tech I and Tech II, each strictly better than the last. Meta 4 is often ideal, but you generally have to look up which mod is meta 4 as the name is little help.

My name is Jesus. I brought the lube.
---
You are _definitely_ in the wrong corp. 
---
Though the exact reason _why_ could be explained by a number of reasons. It could be timezones (the people that play like you are all asleep), or you could be in a lowly renter-corp full of alts. Or it could be something else entirely. 
---
That's something you'll have to work out yourself. 
---
Did Horde PL Pets rage ping because it looks like they just got random ships and started shooting xD
---
Yes we should all ignore the blatantly obvious evidence of cheating here because of your feeling-based proof that some dude who mines literally every day of his life absolutely can't click between a few accounts and hammer shift-R within a few seconds.
---
Hate the meta as much as you want but maybe try to fight it within the rules of the game?
---
Holy fuck that's sad
---
&gt; I prefer to actually play the game
---
I'm not not playing the game just because i play it differently. 
---
&gt;I find that fun.
---
I find doing exploration fun. I don't find fleet battles fun. I don't find being pushed back into a station and unable to even undock without 30 sets of blasters up my tailpipe fun. 
---
I join fleets now and i press f1 or i fly logi to scrub the "small gangs" off the face of eve because i remember how awful being their prey was. Having 30 wardecs in hisec while i was still trying to learn the ropes. Being camped into station by caps. Just having to log off because you couldn't play because people were trying to wring "content" out of you.
---
Sorry i don't sympathize with your vicious need to drive people off the game because you derive them of an income to buy pvp ships with by always killing their ratting, mining or missioning ships. I don't feel bad if you are driven to unsub because you can't play. You didn't feel bad when it happened to me. So i'm just returning what was given to me.
---
We did and he got mad and banned goons from BB fleets
---
I mean. If you consider anchoring and pressing f1, unironically fun, then more power to you. You'll make a great line member. 
---
I also don't think you know what the fuck you're talking about lol
---
&gt;Having 30 wardecs in hisec
---
That's not really small gang. That's just ganking in hisec. 
---
&gt;Being camped into station by caps.
---
That's also not small gang. ?????????????
---
&gt; Just having to log off because you couldn't play because people were trying to wring "content" out of you.
---
Gee, that's a weird small gang that sites in local and hangs around. Sounds more like camping at that point. Just because it's not 50 dudes doesn't make it small gang lmao
---
That last paragraph though, you're either a troll or painfully salty lol
---
Especially if you're actually in brave; you have a terrible attitude for that alliance. There's some real fun dudes in brave who like small gang - are they terrible people too? lol
---
It always hits me when I read such horse ship posts, worst part is it being upvoted. No, EVE doesn't need a wormhole type of spawning in Nullsec. No, VNI ratting is not bad for the game. What is bad for the game is the retarded capital proliferation the game is actually in. Why would infinite ratting be a problem in EVE when infinite mining/gathering/crafting is not in another game ? Sure you're gonna say "It's not the same game your fuck", and yeah, it's not the same game, but why should it be a problem in EVE besides the fact that players decided it is ? I mean, let's face it, you don't want wormhole type of respawn because VNI ratting is bad for the game, you want it because if farming ships were forced to move to keep ratting, it would make an easy and low effort way to get "content", assuming that poor ratting VNI is enough content for you, which is the case of lots of people in the end. And in the end, why is it so offensive that this poor VNI can chain sites when Rorqual mining is perfectly fine ? You think you are going to "Make EVE Great Again" with that ? Nah, ratting capital won't care, they will just jump to another system with a citadel in it and keep going with his life, end result, you didn't solve the problem, and you still won't get any content from it, ggwp.

I was really hoping you were gonna miracle kill that Enyo.

So whats the song name?

At the moment TMOCC is the only 'big' FW alliance in amarr right now, with Local is primary joining soon. TMOCC covers eutz and Local is primary covers ustz.

I cant read the Eula. REEEEEE. is what you are saying, 
---
TYOOL 2019 where we expect CCP to be consistent...
---
&gt; I mean. If you consider anchoring and pressing f1, unironically fun,
---
No i don't i already said that. I said i like doing exploration. I said i do those things to make the game better to play for the people who were once like me.
---
&gt;That's not really small gang. That's just ganking in hisec.
---
Ganking is ganking, it doesn't matter if your ganking in hisec lowsec or nullsec its still ganking. 4-8man fleet after fleet coming to take their pound of flesh, you only have so many pounds to give up.
---
&gt;That's also not small gang. ?????????????
---
Caps are not the only kinds of fleets that can camp single ships into stations.
---
&gt;Gee, that's a weird small gang that sites in local and hangs around.
---
That's what they do. Stick around until someone comes around who can shoot back and then they flee.
---
&gt;That last paragraph though, you're either a troll or painfully salty lol
---
Yes i am very salty about this. Which is why i don't sympathize with your gameplay style dying. Nor do i expect you to sympathize with me if mine ends up dying in the end.
---
&gt;There's some real fun dudes in brave who like small gang - are they terrible people too?
---
If they are gonna go to the heart of another alliance's systems and expect, no demand caps to not get dropped on them yes.
---
*whispers* ^(people are saying i need to make 100 post per day - trying to fulfill expectations they put in me)
---
Apply to a corp that will support your game style and your needs. That's is important to be in an environment when you can have max fun/hour.
---
Back in the day, before Power Creep^TM  
---
This mechanics was brought in to stop people from warping in a heavy tanked ship to tank the Rats, and a DPS ship to kill them.
---
Think on that for a bit.
---
The same people gladly had Kugutsumen breaching everyone's phpBB forums for them for years and years after he was permabanned, but they're honorably fighting for the health of the game by grring goons you see.
---
Ban everybody input broadcasting, no matter who they're with.
---
I've totally missed all of this. Don't know if i want to research what is actually going on here.
---
Thanks for the entertaintment, we had some solid laughs and fun over at our norwegian corp! damed when the apostles hit the grid, we where sure that it was over, but damed the facepalms when the first one blew. 
---
Okay. You should express your feelings in the channel you have dedicated to small gang. Remind them they're terrible people. Maybe hearing something from your own corp will convince you. 
---
&gt;grr gons
---
FTFY
---
I couldn't care less about this bullshit considering he is not even close to beeing the only one. 
---
Still I want to see the world burn, so'll ping /ccp\_falcon
---
That's kind of funny. Matterall has been doing this for 3 years and I just recently joined them. Check out some of the shows and join our discord if you have feedback or ideas, https://discord.gg/dZDpwr
---
Yes. They can. You can set up multiple sell order by just splitting your stacks.
---
"caps got dropped we got blapped off the field that sucks" is different from "they should be unable to mobilize caps in defense of their home."
---
Except Gaara apparently wasnt banned for months after that incident, and it isnt even clear if he ended up getting banned for input broadcasting or something else.
---
Ron, I'm on your side buddy, but multi-sell is a thing fam.
---
The answer you will get depends on how you feel about coproscriptophagy.
---
To everyone who says you can't have supers in wh space. Remember what they said you could and couldn't have in the Frig size Class 13 wh systems? Then the Rorqs killmails appeared in them.

Makes you think.

You are the cheese thats at the tip if my penis dude
---
The answer is to delete Stain from the game, and any characters currently in it.
---
To the people saying that he won’t have any advantage by using input broadcasting:
---
He logs into his accounts and cloaks all of them at the same time thus being ready in an instant and not being threatened to get scanned out.
---
Isn‘t this an major time advantage and mechanism to keep his assets safe?
---
Basically a multi-box camper with about 60 accounts (surely not) said the same thing in multiple locals simultaneously, demonstrating he was almost certainly using input broadcasting for certain things.  
---
I hink StainGuy makes a good case.  But I do think somebody who rolls 60 accounts probably needs to see a clinical psychologist.
---
coming from someone who considers automation and broadcasting are the same thing, I take "autism" as encouraging.
---
I think you misunderstood, they want you to make 100 less posts per day.....
---
Broadcasting allows for automation.... How do you not comprehend this......
---
Heresy!
---
I know man, I just felt that my narrative posts were lacking this week. Have I mentioned that Perimeter Police Department has opened a case on possible market manipulation citing racketeering and tom foolery in the third degree?
---
WHEN WILL THIS GUY WHO KEEPS BLOWING UP MY VNI BE BANNED ALREADY?!?
---
I think all of abyss was over hyped. Not just the mods made from it.
---
&gt;He logs into his accounts and cloaks all of them at the same time thus being ready in an instant and not being threatened to get scanned out.              
---
If this is what he use it for - it gives him huge advantage.       
---
But mostly fact is that he accidentally multi-brodcast ... so he was doing the same before ( and forgot to shut it down ) or was meant to do it (but enabled it to early).               
---
What is also important here - there is no question if he is multi-broadcasting, as every one have no doubt now that he do it. 
---
Do you have any ACTUAL proof of this? If no, you are plainfuly LYING when affirming something you know nothing about. If yes, and you submitted those ACTUAL proof to CCP, then you are allowed to make a new post shaming CCP for not taking action against ACTUAL botter.
---
But so far, you brag someone is cheatting without anything as a proof.
---
It's just insults and harasment.
---
#NotAllVets
---
Yes it can, multi sell and proper item split.       
---
Also yes there is few big people that manipulate plex - you currently need to spend 20-30T to change this situation for a while.       
---
Kinda wish that incursions were somehow tied to Stain, like maybe increased activity in either if the other gets beaten down too hard or something. Heh, make highsec incursions more plentiful by wiping out Stain sansha, then do the inverse, so both carebears and nullbears can grind out ISK in NPC peace.
---
That sounded dumber than I thought it would be.
---
Just so you know, what I'm about to say is not defending this cheater (I'm for a ban). I'm just giving an answer to you question.
---
To spam local with ascii dino pics in massive tidi fests?

Awwww... what a great idea! Lemme go use my new Venture and show off that super cool skin!!!!

**KAPOW &lt;fade to white&gt;**

"Yeah... fuck this game."
---
QQ
---
ITT: Goons and test pretty much trying so hard to get him banned (i wundur why), people blatantly ignoring the fact that someone used input broadcasting, and other people learning how many people get out of crimes IRL - circumstantial evidence.
---
He's using it for "pvp", i.e. he camps dozens of systems and roams with a group of bombers.  
---
Since when?
---
I'm not an expert or anything, but putting "FUCK PGL" as the title to your astra is not conducive to people wanting to save it. That's like someone yelling FIRE at a store named FUCK BALD EAGLES. Let it burn motherfuckers, burn!
---
Can I jump clone to a wh citadel from k-space? 
---
This is probably true. I am Australian, there's always a few people on when I am but only like one other person is also Australian. So people on when I am might be more wanting to solo/chill play after getting up or playing late and keep the excitement/social play for their own timezone.
---
Oh god.  The ever sanctimonious Olmeca is here.
---
&gt;it definitely wasn't for rmt.
---
Oh shit I'll allow it 
---
Which you can only do 1 account at a time so pasting your copied password works just fine.
---
Winterfell is yours your grace
---
Spin aside, my point is that ALL of the current plex for sale on the market are put on sale by a few people.
---
No it's just PL dying
---
Not sure if troll or a real question o_o
---
&gt;Gaara's accidentally lights the cyno on all rorquals in the same time
---
  *While input broadcasting*
---
 Fuck him. Let hackers burn.
---
think of doing that or using 2 afk vnis/ishatrs in 2 sites with double the income instead
---
Chill out guys. Thats just stuff that happens in alpha state 
---
Did you report the "fucktard"?
---
"content creator"?
---
Teach me the ways of getting a BS in abyssal sites
---
Someone is liquidating their assets
---
Sounds like they are expecting a cheap plex injection by CCP
---
I didn't think of that. Interesting.
---
Um Gaara got banned for RMT afaik
---
So much times that CCP probably blocked me out the report feature. That plus the fuckload of high-sec distribution bots 
---
That's amazing 
---
I bet thatebecause whoever buys plex wtih cash in order to convert to isk doesn't want the hassle of micromanaging sell orders in jita/perimeter, or wait 2 days untill the orders sell so they just sell to buy orders. 
---
Old npc agro prioritizes any kind of ewar, but doesn't distinguish who it's targeting. It was probably intended to make them go for squishy support ships or something.
---
same out in null with cynos, scouts and hunters its usually a handful carrying the many
---
You can smell the desperation
---
More accurately: lets web the kitey ship so it eats shit from the ishtars drones :)
---
- stainguy posts have topped the average posting quality of this sub a while ago (not because of his superhigh quality, think about it)
---
- stainguy is not anti goon, he is and always was anti PanFam
---
- as a Dino, what you have against Sansha, they are your bread &amp; butter ?
---
- when the big blocks get no-fatigue-gatelanes I see no problem in giving Stain ONE lowsec gate ...
---
still upvoted for effort ;-)
---
does anything really matter in this game when large groups have huge safety nets and when fights actually happen everyone just blobs the shit out of each other? lets be real here.
---
That's how mafia should work
---
But a citadel should be able to be defended if resources are scarce (however meekly possible that may be), so its owners should be able to fuel it up even if it's being attacked, but given a ramp timer based on its HP at the time it's refueled before the damage cap is reestablished for the rest of the fight's duration (however long the fuel is able to last).  This would also give the attacking side time to bring in more reinforcements to apply as much damage as they can before the damage cap becomes apparent.
---
Yes
---
2 solutions: 1warp scrambler and 1 warp dirupt
---
Or a faction warp scrambler that have a strenght of 3 points
---
What if the lowsec gate to stain required you to go through abyssal space?
---
More importantly where can I join the Mar5hy fan club? They seem like cool kids.
---
Bubbles.
---
Bubbles everywhere.
---
The dream is alive
---
back in good ol days .used to take a incursus in fountaine and kill megas bears in anoms...why is game shit?cuz everything ccp done was to reduce content and make space nullsec safer than hisec...risk versus reward?wtf is this?
---
Yes they could fit two to catch you or fit one of the faction scrams that has 3 points of scram strength.
---
Oh, it's not the handful.. usually. Probably half of us bring sabres to everything. I personally don't if I'm already running 4 dps accounts or whatever, unless it's a quick gank.
---
I do remember a fortizar/dread bash, except we had 9 dudes in rr ships and 3 sabres. Cursed evening. Fed my first sabre like a tard, the second one lasted until the structure was almost dead. Fort had 30 seconds left on repair timer. 
---
Fun night. 
---
they should make it so that people with good standing to a pirate faction are not attacked by rats unless you attack them. 
---
exactly what a lvl 1 crook would say
---
Warp scram + disruptor is quite common when hunting. Faction scram will also do the trick.
---
Karmafleet
---
dont listen to him, he s full of shit, how u scale vni is by adding more accounts. Gilas also have higher dps for less sp, they are more expensive. If you are in horde, go on comms and try salvaging behind a super.

Is this something you can prove?   
---
If ccp sees him doing this, they will ban him, if not they wont. We don't need 30 reddit posts about it
---
I don’t have a proof for this as this is solely an observation I made by myself. It is hard to make evidence of dscan and login progressings.
---
I just wanted to make clear that there definitely are some benefits for cloaking campers doing input broadcasting.
---
It is also not my part to judge this case in any way. He blew his cover and now CCP guys have to do their jobs finding him guilty or not.
---
Also as OP states it’s not about whether he is guilty or not. Punishment must be equal among all players.
---
You used to be able to Dual Prop Nos fit, not sure if that still works but it really made it stand out. For sure you can still Ancillary/TD and all sorts, the utility high and spare mid combination are really quite strong.
---
Honestly while a buff to replace nullificiation would be nice its about the best balanced class in the game, all four have a use case that beats out the other and as a class they're a useful combination of strengths. They beat AFs when it comes to chasing stuff down and beat Fleet Interceptors for tearing across the grid and murking those fucking damps. The versatility that comes from combining multiple roles is what makes them useful in small gang when numbers/resources are low, for whatever reason lots of people seem to struggle to appreciate ships like that. Ashimmus get similarly marked as trash tier, Omens/Stabbers too. None of them are.
---
Are they niche as fuck in a world where lowsec is less small gangs and more all the caps on everything? Sure, but that doesn't make them bad or even close really. There's a dozen other ship lines than need love more.
---
Is it a breakup video or something ?  
---
This is the offer we need! 
---
here, have my like for admitting you have no proof and it's CCP to judge :)
---
Back in the day, you used to be able to remotely DD onto a active cyno. 
---
AoE DD + cyno = just another great decision from CCP.
---
now this is podracing
---
No it does not.
---
I think you're talking about the Gravitational Transportation Field Oscillator (also know as: GTFO). 
---
It never made it into the game AFAIK.

I really really do, indeeed.

If i'm specifically hunting scanning ships in lowsec, I'll fit two warp scrams on my Sabre. If your in null itll be a single scram with the bubble. 
---
Check your filters amd make sure cosmic anomalies is checked. Also there is a questions thread stickied at the top of this sub for questions like this so feel free to delete this post whenever
---
You somehow missed the people saying ban every cheater despite their alliance? 
---
eek
---
So wait, how did that work?  Were they just activating it while jumping to the cyno or were they able to control the module like it can connect to a cyno and activate from there?
---
holy fuck we get it you're a shill https://zkillboard.com/character/90919062/

why was this gem deleted?

---
Also possible would be  to smartbomb you, which is a common camping scheme used in Lowsec when traveling from gate to gate for small things like frigates, otherwise as mentioned before people can use multiple scams or a combination of scram and point (disruptor) to pin you down. That is, from my experience, mostly run in Wormhole Space to hunt, though not uncommon in other parts of space as well. 
---
They've been doing this for a while iirc. When I made a new account a few years ago I do remember getting a condo invite from a GM since I was a new character in the rookie channel. It does help I'm sure. 
---
The only thing you’re missing is a cloak, right? And really, the only thing that’s good for is dodging gatecamps; anyone actively hunting you will just wait for you to decloak and start hacking. 
---
So, either pick a region of null where you think there won’t be any camps, and use stuff like Dotlan and eve-gatecheck to be sure, or go to wormhole space like the other guy said, where camps are almost non existent

The mutaplasmid results were Pre-nerfed to prevent player (reddit) outrage, so are pretty much not worth doing. so there is that.

---

---
Not the GTFO, it seems to be the AoE damage DD (the Bosonic Field Generator one).  I'm unsure how it can be remotely activated to a cyno.
---
There were a few iterations.
---
Originally the DD was a huge AoE weapon. It could be fired from the ship or through a cyno. And by that I mean they would press a button in one system, the doomsday effect would take place in another system.
---
Then it was nerfed so that they could no longer fire their DD through a cyno, they had to be on grid to wipe it clean. This changed the meta so that battleships had to be able to survive at least one, preferably 2 DD’s.
---
As Titans got more ubiquitous this was no longer tenable. They changed the DD from an AoE to a single target attack that could deal enough damage to instantly kill a capital ship. 
---
However they could also be activated on subcaps. Meaning they were frequently being used to snipe FC’s and entire logistics wings of conventional fleets. So once again they were changed this time to only be able to activate their DD on capitals.
---
And finally (I believe) we got given the system we have today. 
---

I have looked around forums and searched the sub for an answer on this and no one seems to have given a straight answer, just a lot of hassle and stick to the OP's.
---
When probe scanning, the entire overlay is blank and I receive a message about nothing to scan. I spent about 25 minutes trying each sector.
---
I have checked all filters to make sure everything is visible and tried making custom filters to just allow what I want to show. I have also tried 0.9-0.4 with no success.

Is the reason for this that someone has been there before me and cleared out the zone of data, relic, &amp; gas sites?
---
Asked a few times to no response.

You must be new to eve.

I am in a large group and play mostly solo. I pay my taxes and have a wealth of resources available to me and whenever I'm in the mood can hop in standing fleet and get a dread kill no problem. It's great!

LMFAO!

They already do that, right?
---
I've corrected the text. Thanks for the heads up.

You can make the hero BS with hyperion / Dominix / Armagueddon against very small gang ;=) So yes you can play, and pvp solo (because pve is so boring)
---
Jeeeesus

To be fair more suggestion are pretty shitty.
---
Some say sue eats them before every undock attempt
---
Yer correct, ty.
---
After that they added more DD types right? Never knew what a Lance or the other thing and the GTFO and the BFG were.
---
My space dad says I'm not allowed to play with bombers bar
---
When you jump into a new system you should be able to see if there are any cosmic anomalies to scan without even launching probes. If there are no 0% cosmic anomalies and you haven't filtered them out then move to the next system. Also as this post is just after DT there can also be a long delay in them spawning after DT.
---
They already ate it. Look at it, that comment was said with the confidence of someone who knows they can eat a hat if they have to.

Nah
---
I was done with Being told what to do what to think and what i can and cannot to by People i never met. Don't know and have no loyalty towards.     So i went from nullsec back to high sec
---
you are the one talking about the mitani, whom I don't give a shit about. Only goon alts do this , I personally assume there are other people other than the mitani who deserve more to be talked about, so using this toon means a lot about your bias.
---
You also are the one saying that input broadcasting implies input automation, which is just … well, wrong, by definition. And then you are the one calling me autistic because I point out that they are two different things and can't be interchanged as many goons are doing here. So yeah, you are a goonswarm fanboy/girl (I don't assume your gender).
---
It really sounds like you followed the usual advice on this Reddit of joining a big new player friendly null sec blob and got owned. Ha ha that’s what you get for listening to people here. 
---
LUL. what shit alliances have you been joining?
---
I basically play with the same people for last 10 years, not many left from the old guard but from time to time some login to 'rediscover eve' for a while.

Having multiple backup (alts in various places) plans is also good thing to have.

Thank you.

I honestly can't think of anyone else in goons because I'm not a goon, and yes input broadcasting is automation of activity, the definition of botting is quite literally the automation of inputs, input broadcasting achieves this, I'm not at all trying to interchange the meaning at all, you just have a ridiculously thick skull and are as incapable of understanding basic things as a typical goon line member 
---
&gt;faction distributor have 2
---
wait, waht ?
---
&gt;bubbles don't care how many stabs you have
---
unless you have 100 warp stabs, which is easily doable on any … well, nope actually.
---
still, doable on titans ?
---
If a loki is fit to kill afk ratters -- yes, it can. If a loki is fit to actually engage in combat -- no, it can not.
---
And that's the sad part: for some reason people take T3Cs and fit them in a way they can't engage in combat vs 1 cruiser. I don't get it. Take stratios for that purpose -- it's cheaper, it can do the same thing: you can kill afk ratter, you can't engage in combat.
---
But, I guess, thinking is too hard..
---
&gt; input broadcasting is automation of activity,
---
no it's not. They are two separate things, with two different definitions. until you prove those two definition are the same thing, they are different things and your post reeks of autism.
---
i input broadcasted several times this month
---
these are our people

Actually no :) I joined a small Corp (like 60 members including alts) through the forums. Didn't start visiting here till afterwards looking for the latest gossip.
---
My priority in MMOs is always social. Fun people make even the dullest game fun (not that EVE is) and I always look to groups where I can make friends &lt;3
---
here you have a definition by CCP falcon on the difference between input automation and input broadcasting. [https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/message/5241022/](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/message/5241022/)
---
This clearly uses two different definitions, and thus the two terms mean two different things.
---
Yeah but so does stainguy, so. 
---
still wouldnt work if you have ever used isboxer for example, you can set any random interval you like and the interval is even standard
---
 Well, goon do a lot of cloaky camping so....
---
I Knew Gara, Seeing his 50 rorqual working together in 1 belt was fantastic. He get banned because he cheated, we are all ok with that. I  was feeling bad for him, but rules are the rules, for everybody, friends or ennemies.
---
This guys should be banned exactly the same way. Cheating is cheating. Dont care if it s an ennemy, my dog, or a good guys.
---
Also this guys had been temporary banned for botting so...
---
He WILL be banned. No other solution for him / CCP.
---
but gaara
---
This item is friggin genius, i must admit
---
nooooooooooo
---
in the sniper tower
---
when he was moving his alts all over the place he did several times exactly the same mistake by broadcasting some text here and there as well as warping them in multiple systems at same time and so on.
---
Exploration Hunter Bombers usually fit 2 normal Meta-Scramblers, giving them 4 points. These guys have prescanned their constellation sites and are already sitting in site cloaked when you enter system.
---
Bubbles are limited to Nullsec space, and they usually only catch you on gates. If you watch D-Scan closely you should be able to warp off the explo site when seeing an interdictor on scan.
---
with the rorquals
---
with the cynos
---
I disagree with you because it seems that would please you.
---
Otherwise I think you are supposed to go in an alliance when it allows you to get your goal. And change when you realize it was all a lie.
---
10/10 local.
---
Ceptor with cloak and probe launcher is still the safest way to scout wormholes, they don't get stuck whenever dictors camp the hole. It's okay because they lack scanning bonuses and the midslots to be great at it.
---
My bad.        
---
it should be 'FUckng goons'
---
What if he has very small computers and very small mice thats taped together? 
---
on the belt
---
Sure he have. 
---
I (and a few people I know) use stealth bombers fitted with 2 warp scramblers and rockets to grab explorers like you. Because there's no targeting delay after de-cloaking a bomber, it's typically 2 to 3 seconds to land tackle compared to the 7+ for other cloaky hunters... so be aware of that.
---
Also having a cloaky sit tight in a site (nul/wh specifically) and send in a hyperspatial rigged sabre to land next to you when you approach the right can. That can be avoided if you are paying attention to d-scan, which you *should* be doing anyway.
---
and we should have a stain gate but we cant all have what we want
---
And I’ve flown with him and know he fucks up a couple bombers
---
Unless Input-Broadcasting is deemed a more serious offense than botting surely he'll get away with a 3 day ban for first offense.

You're in a coalition that has probably the most bots and input broadcasters (like that 30 mining barges retard or Gaara), but yeah, keep posting about Mar5hy.
---
man, you guys are still on this.
---
what about what about what about
---
You keep trying to say a husky and a pug are completely different, but they're both dogs mate, botting and input broadcasting result in a similar net gain to the player utilising them, and players utilising either are treated to similar stipulations, being a ban, he is still cheating regardless of what he was using the input broadcasting for, it's fucking automation of some degree (not requiring an individual action on each instance) across multiple accounts
---
you're gonna get banned again if you keep it up.
---
assumption: input broadcasting is against the rules
---
fact: it's not against the rules in and of itself. 90% of the things in this game can't be broadcasted legally, but some things can.
---
it's totally likely mar5hy was input broadcasting illegally on top of the 'legal' ways to do it, but it's not like we have any proof he does it illegally 
---
[Goons totally ain't input broadcasting](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004733/201812031400/)

I'd be careful about posting with that sentiment if your reddit username is known to your alliance because Mittens won't think twice about banning someone who says something like that
---
let me be clear, i actually do not give a shit about krabbing, camping, or input drama.
---
at all.
---
it's just people reeeeing about "this week's thing :tm: "

I never was banned in any game.

Jokes on you cause I fixed it already. This revolutionary change coming in the next release.
---
This was a test of your patience.
---
You pass.
---
Do you have a source on that? Not saying you're wrong. I seem to remember 3 days but neither TOS, EULA or ban policy mention a specific length for first offense (quote: " However, warnings may be given for first time offenses, followed by account suspensions of varying degree and ultimately a permanent ban if a player" - yes it is "if" on the website).
---
Reading that there might even be no suspension at all for him for first offense as this seems to be entirely up to CCP's judgement.
---
Gaara is banned since almost 2 years
---
BB dies if he gets banned. Think of the content he generates. Sure Input Broadcasting is against the eula / tos. Sure he needs punishment. Think of the player content. 
---
Bots don't PvP.....Not consensually at least. 
---
This is great.
---
Using the old station models doesn't really work with citadels tho. Citadels have multiple/many undocking points, based on ships sizes, station models only have 1 undocking bay for everything.
---
I do agree that more diverse citadel models would be nice tho, even if they only are a bit different.

---
It is NOT automation.

so when you say automation is banned so he should be banned, you are just making a retard of yourself, just as if you affirmed pugs are not allowed in pug shows because huskies are not allowed.

Posts are like history or most of the human actions - how something is perceived depends on the each person.

Liberation for one group is invasion and occupation for opposite one.               
---
Religion for one is Faith for another one, yet superstition for someone else.                  
---
In the same way good post for one person is a shit post for another one also there will be people calling it badposting.              
---
The only way you would manage to get CCP to do that is to persuade sufficient people to simultaneously cancel all their subscriptions. 
---
If that happened CCP would listen, without that they are deaf to any form of common sense.
---
&gt;t's fucking automation of some degree (not requiring an individual action on each instance) 
---
You sir, are fucking dumb.
---
There is a reason CCP made two different definitions : those two things are completely different. One is banned no matter what, the other is allowed on a few given circumstances.
---
Please, learn to read, that will save your family from your stupidity.

YEah they use ASIC miners these days

&gt; get scanned out.
---
Do you think someone would just sit in system all day with combats out ready for a marshy alt to login in all day for a single bomber kill?
---
Both are under the EXACT same rules though, botters also get a short ban for first time offence and a perms ban for second time offence, same for input broadcasters, because they both allow for automation of play.... 
---
I fail to see how that has anything to do with input broadcasting.
---
Besides, "bbutbtbubuttbubuttbuubtt goons do it too!" is the most retarded argument in this.
---
It's almost like the biggest coalition in the game has the most of everything.
---
I think the worst part about this is Jay picking up this weeks npbee news
---
no, CCP made a specific set of rule for each.
---
the punishment is the same.
---
and input broadcaster do not allow automation of play.
---
A lot of that shit came with citadel I think. Most of the above is well before citadel. 
---
Fucking goons
---
How about applying the rules to all?  
---
I mean saying well you all have cheaters to, to excuse someone who is violating the rules is a bad as being a democrat or republican. 
---
Ban them all I say 
---
as example, the following use of "input broadcasting" use is ALLOWED explicitly by CCP :  
---
•	EVE Online client settings  
---
So saying they are subject to the same rules is complete. absolutely . definitely. total retard.
---
read that post, and fuck off.

It can't. It was the first iteratiob of doomsdays, which were like huge smartbombs, except they could be used either from the ship itself or be activsted through a cybo in another system.

But that got changed like a decade or more ago. DDs have gone through quite a few different iterations since then.

The salt in the comments is epic!!! Can I harvest it?

Good, thank's for asking. Did you have any comments about the current thread? 
---
I once had a whole conversation with someone just with dscan ship names, cause neither of us wanted to write in local.
---
New to competitive MMOs or just EvE? 
---
The real cringe fest is all these hordlings who are too afraid to outright challenge my claims and instead resort to vague insults and passive aggressive attacks on my character. Deep down they know I am right and that it will be easier for them to back peddle away from vague insults later on than if they had actually contested anything I said in the video. 
---
Get snubbed kid
---
Well, properly fitted and piloted -- it can. But those people who are targeting afk ratters can't do it. So, for their purpose stratios is as good as T3C, IMHO, so I don't really get it, why use T3C?
---
No. That happens with bad suggestions 
---
... I've run eight hulks for ages. You aren't doing 20 without a problem.
---
Damn new frigate skin ...
---
Skins generate income - fixing local not
---
You can do 3 cycles per hulk before you empty them. Which is about 2 minutes from 15 seconds.
---
It's fun to convo someone randomly and post a screenshot being 10km off them
---
It’s like they’re actively trying to offend us by imitating Wargaming with their offensively priced bullshit.
---
This capital skin wouldn’t sell very well if they included the actual pricetag, which is about 25 euros or dollars, whichever currency your account is locked to.
---
I upvoted a StainGuy post...damn.  CCP must be getting \*REALLY\* incompetent.
---
He meant to say “shit”, but instead chose to use some edgelord memeword of the week.
---
DEAR GOD NO.  Every time CCP "overhauls" a UI element it gets harder to read, less functional, and now with 3x more lag.  They are beyond incompetent at UI design.
---
Oh look, more offensive skin prices.
---
Yeah, when I look at the price of plex packages I laugh at what they are trying to actually charge.
---
Because if I don't laugh, I'd cry.
---
OR, hear me out, remove Stain.
---
2014 is 4 yo but whatever.
---
The second link does not prevent input broadcasting. Where exactly does it say "It has to be the unadulterated full eve experience for each logged in character." ?
---
it only forbid any "\[device\] *that facilitate acquisition of \[resource\] at an accelerated rate when compared with  ordinary Game play."*
---
https://mutaplasmid.space
---
That site looks at all costs contracts currently up and if you linked your esi you can make it pop up at the click of a button. 
---
now imagine a mordus anom in low sec , aggressor being instant point/web by rats allowing the pve boat to simply apply dmg and kill the guy that landed in his anom. *thumbs up*
---
Hopefully you have screenshots that you can share. No excuse for that stuff.
---
holy fuckin beta post 
---
Reddit is not your personal army
---
What rorq killmails?
---
You should save your bad posting for Discord. It does no one any service, but at least on there we're the only ones that have to see it.  
---
MAKE THE ARTISTS FIX BUGS PLS
---
I mean the term pet is incorrect we much prefer the term meatshield.
---
Gaara was a multibox miner for whose operations broadcasting was inelimiable. He might have also been banned for RMT. 
---
Mar5hy is an afk camper and content creator for whose operations broadcasting is not even important. He is saving about 10 minutes everyday by logging in with broadcasting.
---
There are serious negative macroeconomical consequences of the minerals or ISK produced by PvE broadcasters. All Mar5hy has been doing is creating explosions for himself and everyone he FCs for. What you are saying is similar to someone claiming the Somalian hijackers and Greenpeace ships are equally guilty of piracy.
---
That works
---
Well the difference is , you can’t buy gold with credits you earn ingame fromwargaming , so it’s not the best comparison 
---
These investigations take time, and when you've got somebody out there spinning folks up when he's not providing the entire story, I can see why they made the post. That thing sat atop reddit for a whole day.  But, again, there was a ticket. 
---
I'm not saying they won't ban the guy. I'm saying they won't ban the guy if nobody follows the proper procedure. But it looks like somebody did, so we'll see how long it takes. 
---
Some of my fits have abyss mods. You'd think they are expensive. But usually it's a badly rolled dark blood point where only the range stayed the same. They go for much less then an actual dark blood module. Same for other mods. 
---
Welp I lost 3 VNI’s in 3 days🙂👌🏻 thank god these things are cheap
---
I use a Astero for combat all the time, but in low sec. You send a bait in any novice plex, you stay outside the plex orbiting gate at 2500m. When something engage the bait, you slide. You warp at plex at 20km, so you gonna land at 8km thus keeping your cloak, approch gate until u get to 2500m and there u go. Deadspace repper, Dark blood neut, ab/scram/web/cap booster/DDA/DCU. Ive been rcking this for a couple month and its wonderfull. PM me if you want more infos. o7
---
damn son, the goons are so salty and full of shit i'm afraid they will explode if you barely touch them...
---
Everyone plays the game differently, glad you found what made you happy
---
I mean CCP has literally approved player made EVE-O Preview and said “hey wanna multibox? Use this!” yet people still wanna gamble.
---
Let me know what SOV you think you can have in WH Space in order to get those supers built and I will come help in my Rorq into that C13
---
A good man with a valid project! #stainguyforCSM
---
Read the EULA carefully and you'll find it's not when it's used in other circumstances not specified:
---
\&gt;  You may not use your own or any third-party software, macros or other stored rapid keystrokes or other patterns of play that facilitate acquisition of items, currency, objects, character attributes, rank or status at an accelerated rate when compared with ordinary Game play. 
---
Aaaah! :) Thats true ofc :D  
---
&gt; I also think somebody who rolls 60 accounts probably needs to see a clinical psychologist.
---
Lots of people in your alliance do it for PvE.
---
People like me and Mar5hy manage so many characters to create content for ourselves. That's a way more respectworthy motivation. But yeah fuck Mar5hy for spending time and dedication for his favorite hobby, while pioneering methods to pursue his Eve activities right? All of us should be F1 monkeys for the real money interests of people who's running twitch channels and crowdfunding schemes.
---
Skin for the Navy Geddon.. for the 5 people that fly it.
---
Too bad that ship is nearly worthless.
---
Come one CCP, let the little guys customise their citadels.
---
They just want to make their haus a home.
---
&gt;That thing sat atop reddit for a whole day. But, again, there was a ticket.
---
I'm trying to be malicious, but how would they know if they don't read reddit? It's a running meme that getting petitions in a visible reddit spot guarantees a response. 
---
As for the case at hand i don't want to cast judgement on the guy because, same as you, i only seen the screenshots and i have not even interacted with him ingame to have other arguments pro or contra banning. 
---
Off-grid links were not a few %increase lol. 
---
then don't buy skins? problem is there are plenty of players who don't give enough of a fuck about actual problems plaguing the game and would rather have their shiny space dildo looke pretty when they spin it in a keepstar every other day...
---
thanks for taking the time to read and reply.
---
lmao 
---
input broadcasting person === input broadcasting person       
---
don't justify actions of one of the persons by differentiation between **miner** and **content creator**        
---
Does cyno die as you DD through it? 
---
Stations have one "exit" port, citadels have multiple, this will screw up big fleet ops when a massive fleet tries to squeeze out of a tiny station undock...
---
I joined goons 4 month ago and love it
---
upvoted for shitting on CCPs content-killing spree

Made it through three lines of propaganda. The rest is just fodder. Moving on..

New skins **Lavacore Imperial** have been made available - so probably this.

Next ban wave announced in Jan 2025

We good boys

Well it would get hit by the DD. That would usually kill it yes!

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

You don't imagine how badly i want to have Revenant - but there is no legitimate way to acquire it now for a person like me.

&gt;never, stop losing your shit to rats.

If you bring a brick tank ship and a 2000 dps vindicator I know who’s making more money.

I want to join your club and experience all the advantages without abiding to your culture, way of doing things and rules!!!
---
Oh wait, this is borderline IRL political stuff :X
---
So you admit to botting basically 
---
Look at that I get all the blame again... I was a sleep so FUCK YOU
---
It’s just a keylogger. No worries unless you’re botting 
---
Think its random not everyone gets hit by it nor ever update. I run 3 accounts on my laptop very rarely after an update to the launcher 1 account may need logged in again.
---
would be nice if they would finally get these out. 
---
Fuck off CCP 
---
4/10 bait post
---
Eve is not a solo game 
---
Rats hate ewar, and webs, points, and scrams count.
---
I agree, citadels look bleek. If they made differnet models atleast their spam would look cool and "alive".
---
it's cute that you think goons are somehow offending in a unique way not shared by other large entities...
---
I'd like to talk to you and your Aridia friends about gas. Aridia has a nice one. Would be interested in buying Pure Standard Blue Pill Booster compound of you're making it.
---
No, I don't bot--but as a programmer I would point out the complexity of the site isn't a factor that prohibits botting. If anything, the need to perform to precision promotes it. Unlike PvP it's not variable enough to be more than a stricter botting challenge.
---
Anchoring V! Yay! Built Standup Support Fighters! Yay! Discovered not much market for Standup Support Fighters. FML.
---
I was replying to Olmeca.I agree that he should be banned
---
In before people start complaining about prices of skins they don't need to buy
---
In before people start complaining that the art team isn't fixing bugs
---
In before someone tells me to stfu and complain because complaining means CCP will take action
---
No worries if you are botting as well 
---
Please tell me it was the one with the turtle in the water tank one.
---
Just adding for equality, to not let this thread look one sided in a bigot way:
---
days without SilverMinerXXX not being banned for input broadcasting since his coalition crying about Mar5hy - Day 2 now
---
I remember those days. 99% resist Damnations yeeted into Angel Extrav. 
---
Just do what you want, because it is your game. If you happy with your small corp, thats good - stay with them and have fun
---
I think that would be good  the channel is called aridia friends if you want to join and talk.  
---
Im gonna get into gas mining soon.  My in-game name is Joseph kucane  if you want to contact me 
---
It's not like I argue content creators shouldn't be punished because I like them. There are principled reasons why CCP should be promoting content creation. Imagine cops being as nuance blind as you when dealing with fathers speeding to get their pregnant wives to hospital lol. Rules do not apply equally to everyone when there are good reasons to not to.
---
Besides, you don't know CCP's ban policy is about one-time broadcasting accidents or it is reserved for people who use broadcasting in a regular manner. For all we know he was using broadcasting legally (yes, you can use it legally) but had a one-time accident. For Gaara, it is safe to assume he was using it for mining all the time.
---
It was indeed. Shit is legit. Coincidentally I am also scared shitless of snapping turtles now
---
Gotta love membercorps doing their own thing in lowsec!
---
You see I have never had this. Since they released the launcher and allowed saving of accounts, the only time has been after a fresh install. Now I probably don't have a huge amount of accounts with only 20 or so but never had it happen at all. 
---
1 Word/formed panfam

&gt; respectworthy 
---
Who but a narcissist refers to himself as "respectworthy"? You really need to take your head out of your backside.
---
&gt; pioneering novel methods to pursue his Eve activities
---
Input broadcasting and cloaky camping aren't "novel" you idiot.
---
&gt;i wonder what the hell was party like that doing inside the C3 wormhole.
---
The rattlesnake was probably ratting, cuz c3 ratting is hella lucrative.  
---
The rest of the group probably either live in the hole or in one of the connecting holes and were abouta jump you. Likely were waiting for you to nearly finish ur sites so the killmail would be juicier. 
---
Excellent, trading handled outside the game on a website, just like that other game mentioned above. Excellent design.
---
YEah
---
Orca has big enough holds that you can carry fitted ships for multiple purposes around in it. Move it close to lowsec - not into lowsec, it will just die - and take out your pre-fitted ships in an adventure.   
---
If you have seen it all in area A, go to area B, rinse repeat. 
---
There's a new boot.ini
---
I knew someone under informed was going to bring up this argument, but it's not a sufficient counter example. For copyright issues the US is able to litigate these issues because of reciprocal agreements between your country and ours. There is no reciprocal agreement for GDPR. Apples and oranges. 
---
Only move your ship if they shoot back. Might reduce their damage a bit.  
---
But otherwise just stay in range of your point/scram/web and have a celestial selected so you only need to click "warp to" when a bigger fish decloaks. 
---
Did you have a stroke?
---
&gt; Who but a narcissist refers to himself as "respectworthy"? You really need to take your head out of your backside.
---
If you wanna argue content creation is not more respectworthy motivation than zombie mining please do so and prove yourself to be a clown. If not, then I can call my motivation more respectworthy and it's not narcissistic just because I pursue that motivation.
---
&gt; Input broadcasting and cloaky camping aren't "novel" you idiot.
---
Because apparently that's all he does. 
---
Besides, there are so many problems you need to solve to cloaky camp with 100 characters. Both on the computational side and in game. You can't do that without pioneering some stuff yourself. Here is one of his threads which people can learn so much from: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8dx74j/a_story_from_a_cloaky_camper_and_an_attempt_to/
---
PS: Another hate spewing disrespectful reply and I'll mute you. That's how I deal with Goon mouthbreather reddit warriors. I don't have time to deal with hundreds of you.
---
This is so stupid. One day Q003 opened in my WH (For those who don't WH - Q003 is a frigate hole to Nulls) I jump in and see several VNIs krabbing Havens. Warp to one, scram, drop drones, don't even look at rats, but they immediately switch to my Astero. This is very stupid mechanic, but it also saved me multiple times. That's how tinker/spider setups work, you can switch aggro by repping whoever is getting shot badly and literally save them.
---
Because you’re bad?
---
You are still missing the point.          
---
It is not about who did it - but about fact that some player did it and should be punished by this.               
---
**Be honest now** - if some miner in delve would do the same and try to defend this guy saying that he should not be punished as he is miner and thanks to people like him we have ships to fly?        
---
     
---
Rules are simple in this case - do not input broadcast (small login/ui tricks kind of excluded) if you go above this you get a ban.        
---
He did went above this basic grey area - what is more important here - **his input podcasting tools were setup to allow more than this gray area**           
---
You know why i want this guy to get proper punishment for this input broadcasting ?            
---
For the same reason that i hate booters.            
---
There is no fun - hell, it is quite annoying - to compete with people that bot or multibrodcast to fleets of alts.             
---
They are always ahead of you and no valid methods allow you to even get close to levels you can compete with them.          
---
Oops, it's edited now
---
You're narcicissm is so boring Olmeca.  Give it a rest will you.

&gt;  and I'll mute you

I couldn't give a flying fuck.
---
For someone over the age of 15 are you able to explain the use of this word to your audience? You have a very toxic post history by the way..

I have nothing to lose, is it ok if I continue?

Because there is no lowsec gate to stain, it’s obvious 
---
&gt; You're narcicissm is so boring Olmeca.
---
It's funny how you and your buddies have to imagine me as this narcissistic neckbeard with no friends and life just because I am causing you problems in game or arguing against your views. Interesting coping mechanism.
---
They probably uploaded the corp picture I sent... of my MASSIVE BALLSACK.

The only way a Revenant can be created is by acquiring BPC from destroyed Sansha Nation supercarrier.            
---
Loyal servant of Sansha Nation like me cannot use equipment acquired this way.         
---
Ha updoot
---
You just named 3 renter-lite alliances. None of them fought for what they have and none of them create their own content (besides maybe Evictus). They're all just lazy ratters/miners with someone at the top who wants to feel important. Killswitch and anyone who lived in/near Cobalt Edge in the last 4 years are renters, and Evictus pretty much only exists because Legacy likes having a buffer zone.
---
If you want to PVP join a real alliance, if you want to PVE cut out the middle man and just rent on your own. Either way you'll find much less hassle.
---
not entirely sure how they plan on killing you with their excavator drones.
---
Check other my other answers here
---
Can it be a pussy hat that you eat?  
---
No, it wasn't, as is with most of the hysteria over nearly every change that this sub-reddit loses its shit about.  This sub reddit just hates change because it's scary.
---
Im gonna take this complaint thread in a different direction.  
---
How many people feel that all the skin additions are sort of ruining some of the allure of the faction and T2 ships from back in the day?  
---
Ill simply never buy skins, but  it was kinda cool to skill into a T2 variant that had a different skin than than the T1....CCP has basically destroyed that.
---
They have been in the game since before Xmas.
---
Doom is known for his humble FCing, leading from the front with class like no other, embodying CYNOU values of equality and friendship.
---
Meanwhile Guristas slapping hybrids and one launcher on all their drone boats and battleships like true space Chads. 
---
I wonder which NPC pirate faction has the most capsuleer kills. 
---
&gt; It is not about who did it - but about fact that some player did it and should be punished by this.
---
But I just gave you an argument on why rules do not apply equally to everyone when there good reasons.
---
&gt; Be honest now - if some miner in delve would do the same and try to defend this guy saying that he should not be punished as he is miner and thanks to people like him we have ships to fly?
---
Miners do not use broadcasting legally and have one time accidents. They use it to save Excavators and do other ingame stuff more easily. If there was a case which we were sure that a miner had a one time accident, then sure I'd argue a ban is too much.
---
&gt; He did went above this basic grey area - what is more important here - his input podcasting tools were setup to allow more than this gray area
---
It's not a safe assumption that one time accidents aren't in the grey area.
---
&gt; You know why i want this guy to get proper punishment for this input broadcasting ?
---
&gt; For the same reason that i hate booters.
---
&gt; There is no fun - hell, it is quite annoying - to compete with people that bot or multibrodcast to fleets of alts.
---
&gt; They are always ahead of you and no valid methods allow you to even get close to levels you can compete with them.
---
You think I don't feel like that whenever a Rorqual broadcaster saves his drones from me? When I work my ass off to do what I do without a third party program? I do. 
---
But Mar5hy is a different case. People like botters and PvE broadcasters are why Eve is slowly dying. People like Mar5hy are why it is still alive.
---
&gt; because I am causing you problems in game
---
You aren't causing me *any* problems.  I don't have any Rorquals.  You just come across as a bit of a twat to others that's all.
---
The party was probably there to help the tackle if they assumed you really were bait. They could have lived in that wormhole or a connected one and just wanted a fight would be my guess
---
\*glug glug glug glug\* 
---
Great now I'm blind and I can't stop throwing up blood. Anyone recruiting? 
---
Honestly when it's done for a single hull type ie armageddon, then I think it should be standard to be available for other variants of the hull (Redeemer, navy armageddon). Like in this instance. I'm happy they did it even tho navy geddon is, like you said, useless. There's been too many times where they don't give a skin for a navy/fleet version of it.  That's why decent ships like the HFI have a poor selection of skins.
---
Take my updoot! Quality shitpost!
---
Dreddit is recruiring.

i would probably buy one if i could customize it
---
/u/ccp_falcon should get this into the correct hands at ccp and get some traction and have this idiot banned
---
Kiiiiind of. But when you consider some of those t2 ships are very very very old, they do lose some of their niche. The only stuff I consider rare or cool are black ops really, and that's only because no fucker outside of null flies em.
---
Just to summarize what you are saying :               
---
There are defined rules of game play - but there are players and there are PLAYERS.        
---
Some rules are not applying to PLAYERS because their gameplay is more valid for me that the one represented by players.         
---
Tbh - if this what you think in game i am afraid what you think about people and PEOPLE in RL.              
---
For me you are wrong.       
---
For me player === player.         
---
Eve is a game and reddit is just 'posting emporium' where we can all post our beliefs, ideas and kill time with some worthless posts.        
---
I know your opinion, you know mine.         
---
You are a basketball coach?
---
Thats fair. I overlooked the t1 geddon, as they didnt include it in the "battleship bundle". Guess the t1 geddon (or Napoc) doesnt count as a battleship.
---
Why have a "Battleship Bundle" when it doesnt even include all the battleships that are listed? Its more like, the "2 decent battleships and 1 no one will use, but will milk you for it anyway bundle"
---
My InTeRnEt PoInTs
---
nobody would use kick out station models (unless CCP changed them or they’re trying to get people on them)
---
Ahh that must've been it, I guess I misremembered it
---
Yea we have been in Cobalt Edge a while. They where all assholes your reaction is completly 100% accurate     idk if i want to join An alliance.
---
&gt; There are defined rules of game play - but there are players and there are PLAYERS.
---
What I am saying is more like there are different contexts. Like Somalian pirates ramming a ship to hijack and Greenpeace ramming a ship to protest.
---
&gt; Tbh - if this what you think in game i am afraid what you think about people and PEOPLE in RL.
---
Yeah like I think if people are speeding to get their pregnant wife to the hospital, they shouldn't be stopped and get a ticket? How dare I be sensitive to nuances? Rules should apply to everyone all the time!
---
&gt; I know your opinion, you know mine.
---
You are actually misrepresenting my opinion to win internet points though.
---
CCP\_Abyss strikes again!
---
Yes, my corp mates usualy shout on comms "we are playing with a COACH ! A manager !". Props if you got that reference
---
Hey, do you not play the current Meta? Multibox AFK-Rorquals or input broadcast Mackies, tab out, start Netflix. For all these l33t players the out-of-game market would be a great QoL-Addition ....
---
&gt;Shock horror. Imagine, not being able to hunt in delve because its too dangerous for the hunting party's killboard.
---
These are entirely unhelpful comments. On the one hand you claim nullsec is supposed to be dangerous ***for the other guy***. But then you say nullsec isn't supposed to be dangerous ***for the hunting party*** because CCP should design the game so that consolidating escalation forces doesn't happen. 
---
Can you imagine a world where goons are the hunting party and the other side hasn't consolidated their forces because CCP nerfed consolidated empires? 
---
At the very least if we are to make any major changes its kinda sucky to do it after TEST, goons and NCdot have anchored over a thousand structures ***each***, especially since it takes 2 months to get moongoo if you move the moon towers. So if CCP fucks up your region it will royally screw you over if you find out that you should move to somewhere you can utilize better. 
---
or maybe USE THEIR WAGES TO HIRE PEOPLE THAT KNOW HOW TO PROGRAM THEIR WAY OUT OF A WET PAPER BAG, since CCP seems to have fired all of those
---
What is your in-game name ?

If I don't care about input broadcasting at all could you please advise how I can join the cringe posting properly???

I care

sorry for the slow reply, i was at work and just got back from a 50km bikeride. I'll try and understand why you like to spend your life being a toxic slug on reddit but i probably never will. That biological waste comment is rather ironic coming from you.

This is a game and guy is cheating in game .... how hard is to see this?

Also like i said there are rubles for this 'pregnant woman'  ....

There is a huge difference between RL and EVE - please don't mix it to much.

I'm all for kicking most of my alliance tbh
---
is that marshy chump on Reddit ? and what does he have to say 
---
This isn't really concern trolling. Concern trolling is an art form and this isn't art.
---
&gt; Your risk averse carebear shenanigans 
---
Just sit down for a minute and think about the irony in a Goon uttering this phrase lol.
---
&gt; don't really cause any problems
---
About 10 months ago Kcolor tried to get me kicked from Outlaws, the Russian wh alliance I am fying with. I guess everything Goons did since then to deal with Excavator booshing and bombing in Delve is done due to me not causing problems lol.
---
I really would like to see the Loki genius shitfit that breaks to an Ishtar and a couple Blood Raiders.
---
It is a very complex game. Given that, the Eve interface is very good. Please DO NOT "overhaul" it -- I'm 99% sure it would become worse.
---
What they really should do: Let the CSM or some other experienced players build new standard interface settings. The current default is bad, and new players don't know that and how it can be fixed.
---
It's just the text documents from jita local that didn't sync to your client the before DT
---
&gt; This is a game and guy is cheating in game .... how hard is to see this?
---
You need to be nuance blind to see it that way.
---
&gt; There is a huge difference between RL and EVE - please don't mix it to much.
---
The principle on which you implicitly base your argument (rules should apply equally to everyone) is a RL principle. So I can cite RL examples which it doesn't work to refute that principle.
---
That's what you get for going to sleep.
---
You must not know who Stunt Flores is.....
---
CCP Fozzie is a fucking pussy.
---
Free Stunt!
---
We used to do this with a drake shield tanked.  It was a sight to behold.  I came back after a half decade thinking this was still true.  No more.  Rip expensive drones.
---
Ah yes, the days when Nighthawk was literally a PvE god-tier ship.
---
he is the one true Lords most devote subject he would never awox
---
:toooldforpokemon: 
---
I'm not even sure the current devs are competent enough to accomplish much in a year.  Everything they release is hard broken, and most of it never gets fixed.
---
Sounds like a win-win all around.
---
Underrated
---
Pretty sure they're already doing that.  Over the last year a ton of prominent EVE players have called it quits, and its generally agreed that the game is in a horrible state.  Since then, what has CCP done?  Started cranking out 5x as many skins, doing "daily login" rewards to inflate numbers, and basically done anything they can to generate short term profit boosts.
---
You ever see that Mtn Dew commercial years ago where the dude is sitting on the couch with a bunch of mannequins and their arms are all connected so when he opens his soda all the mannequins do too?
---
I think that's what he doing, he has a bunch of mannequins and PCs set up in a row and they are linked together so when he clicks his mouse or keyboard they all do.
---
I'm sure I'll still be on furlough so....haha...ha....eh
---
I'll see if I can make this one. Be nice to see players from the area.
---
Hi, you are wrong thinking you can't play solo. Of course you can! This is totally viable.
---
The downsides are: you have to learn a lot and (especially in case of solo PvP career) you will die a lot, but this is okay \^\^
---
Folks who say "join a corp" and "make some friends", "Eve is a social game" are most likely extroverts and often overlook, that there is large group of people who don't find fun in being on comms, gets tired of verbal communication, have enough friends IRL and just want to relax alone, doing their own thing.
---
The key from burning yourself out is doing different things is game, not just PvPing or just mining or whatsoever. And setting yourself a goals, one at a time.
---
You realize there are good alliances as well right? You joined shit alliances and had a shit time. Not very surprising.
---
The 64 bit client worries me.  They have to change enough that this could potentially be a disaster if not handled properly.  Considering CCP literally can't release even the most basic things now without it being totally broken, and they appear to have no QA department, this could unironically be the final nail in the coffin if it totally breaks everything for months+.
---
10bn BRs and now 1bn brs? Legacy posting quality has been getting inversely proportionate to the amount of their krabbing. 
---
At no point did or anyone else ever claim nullsec should be safe for the hunting party. Claiming we did is building up an absurd strawman. My claim is that the balance is far too favorable for the defender at the moment. Eve wasn't always this way. How safe or dangerous space is to roam and to live in has changed over time. Right now it's incredibly safe to live in and incredibly dangerous (and frustrating) to roam in. Don't put words in my mouth - again, I'm not saying what you *want* me to be saying. I'm saying only the things I'm actually typing. I'm not asking for cruisers to solo carriers or defenders to be served up to roaming frigate gangs on a silver platter, and I'm not wasting my time any more defending the things you say I'm saying, rather than the things I'm *actually* saying. 
---
Stockholm Syndrome most likely
---
Can you gives example of rules you would have to follow that were not working with you ?
---
If they have more than 5 guys doing bug/balance fixes at the rate they crank shit out, they should be ashamed of themselves TBH.
---
nah, they will keep thrashing around like a drowning victim. Tossing out new changing in a feeble attempt to bring subs back. They introduced gamebreaking changes (excavator drones and injectors), then figured "Lets toss out a couple thousand ship skins and let the cash roll in!" Im betting servers are shut down forever within 3 years.
---
lol WinterCo awoxes bots left and right, we'll awox we don't give a shit
---
Why the false dichotomy?  What makes you think the guy making and skin is the same guy fixing the problems?  The art team doesn't usually fix bugs and the developers don't usually do texturing.
---
Dayum dont downvote that guy so hard jeez. And yeah no one gives a shit about Jita's local.... 
---
I thought it was a gonna be a bottle of bleach. Left disappointed.
---
Yep, focusing on getting new players but not giving a shit about why you can't retain them is a path that leads to MMO death pretty much every time.
---
Indeed a sad state where the biggest entity in the game attempts to spin this their way. downvote all you want , but you guys could be generating crazy content with big wars and supercapital brawls. But you just stacking your isk and letting the game slowly stale to death. The only real content Goon/init/test could get atm is themselves.
---
Really? That would be awesome. You could live in blood raider npc space, do BR agent missions, and hunt on the side for some pvp when desired
---
&gt; No, VNI ratting is not bad for the game. What is bad for the game is the retarded capital proliferation the game is actually in. Why would infinite ratting be a problem in EVE when infinite mining/gathering/crafting is not in another game ?
---
Imagine if in WoW you could stand in one spot and ore veins would literally appear next to you after 2-3 seconds. You mine the ore. You wait 2 seconds. A new vein literally appears next to you. You mine it. You repeat for 23 hours a day. That's how ratting, and to a lesser extent mining, works in EvE. It would crater any game's economy.
---
&gt; let's face it, you don't want wormhole type of respawn because VNI ratting is bad for the game, you want it because if farming ships were forced to move to keep ratting, it would make an easy and low effort way to get "content", assuming that poor ratting VNI is enough content for you, which is the case of lots of people in the end.
---
Let's face it, infinite sites is bad for the game. You just want it because farming isk is easy and low-effort right now. If it were changed, you'd be forced to expend some effort to make your isk beyond occasionally paying attention to your screen. See? Stupid arguments work both ways.
---
&gt; Nah, ratting capital won't care, they will just jump to another system with a citadel in it and keep going with his life,
---
How people do not understand that this is a major improvement is beyond me. People using more systems in the region they live in? That's good. People moving around? That's good. Each system being able to support fewer 23/7 ratting carriers? That's good. "lol they'd just move around and use more space idiot" is a terrible fucking argument and you should be ashamed that you ever let that thought leave the few folds you have in your brain.
---
They don't
---
This isn't a hugbox.
---
Look at a map my dude. Goons would be spread out throughout about 1/3 of Nullsec if that were the case - which would be _fine._ If they can hold it, they can have it. But the largest group in the game mostly living out of a single region just like significantly smaller groups is not somehow magically better than them being forced to spread out. 
---
Dude, looking at how much salt that "Mar5hy" generates, CCP should explicitly say "Mar5hy is allowed, we approved this". We don't have epic shitshows often enough. Also, we are all looking forward to the hilarity when people complaining about this get caught botting. 
---
PS. show us on this doll where the bomber touched your e-peen 
---
keylogger to catch bots.
---
&gt; or they'd log out and go and play another game instead.
---
Ok, so let me get this straight. When I say that PvP'ers are leaving Eve because the defender has all the advantages, I get told to adapt or die. If a change came along that meant PvE'ers would have to expend a little more effort, you don't have to adapt? You just walk away? Feels more than a little hypocritical don't you think?
---
skill sets? t3cs are baller? I wanna use my tengu for pvp but right now i don't have a tengu to go blow up
---
Good job on integrating fully into high sec.
---
Like a module that temporarily reduces sig radius? Hmm. That might be cool. 
---
What about a module that delayed you entering into local or temporarily made you dscan immune?
---
thank you &lt;3
---
I saw this on prod server last week after injecting a different skill. I thought wtf is Eve coming to when there are typos? I can't even...
---
Yeah, again, you have no idea what you're talking about. Small gang roams hit miners and ratters almost always to try to get a response fleet to form so they can fight that instead. Your perspective is solely of the person being hunted - of course you think that small gang roamers only want to kill miners and ratters. They're killing *you.*
---
What's the scope of the Overview?
---
Back when CCP still had somewhat intelligent developers, they saw how terrible AOE doomsdays were for nullsec. 
---
But with all of them having left over time, we got them AOE doomsdays back with bosons, for whatever the fuck knows reason.
---
Have you noticed how everyone stopped arguing with you? It's not because we can't refute your points. It's because you're willfully ignorant and incapable of considering anything but your own perspective.
---
Sometimes when people stop arguing with you, it's not because you won.
---
You want to participate in a war.
---
I don't need to, or want to. Good luck making me. I'll go and do something that interests me instead.
---
I haven't logged in in a year, but I don't remember there being anything wrong with the chat function.
---
YEah they use ~~asic miners~~  bunch of reddit accounts these days 
---
Have the artists make skins that people will buy so that you can hire programmers to debug, fix, and develop the game? Actually since I hella want that confessor skin, maybe that’s the plan? 
---
I think I need to get a couple of citadels
---
Some game features need heavy use of artists to develop, to the extent that artists become the bottleneck for those (major, major) features. Afterwards, there are lulls in need for artists. So, you have two choices when that happens: treat your artists like temp-worker garbage and forever earn their enmity (a pricey mistake when hiring in *Iceland* with their protectionist hiring laws) or have them do at least *something* with their time during those lulls. 
---
Why you don't drop a dozen caps on 1 corp without a way to extract them.
---
The TNT one, or is there another one I’m not aware of?
---
1 lone crab against the galaxy
---
I knew that there where different undock points depending on size. I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered that there are multiple points even within a size range.   
---
never really noticed until a couple days ago when I saw 200 or so carriers/dreads undocking and realized they where coming out in 2 streams.  
---
don't know why that sight stuck with me so much but it looked really damn cool.
---
All it takes is Guard, Falcon or one of the other Devs who does read the forums to send the link over to the GM team. I don't think they're actively reading reddit to figure out who to ban. Hell, every time I point out a bug the immediate response is "where's the bug report." 
---
To addon - some groups are chill with you having comms [and no microphone]. Bit harder to find though
---
Those old whaling fleets were so much fun
---
The irony is; you sound like you would have fit in well with Goons.
---
I joined horde a year ago, do what I want when I want no one ever says anything about rules, have joined blessed beans only rule I have to follow is get 10 kills a month(lol) you just joined shit alliances 
---
Rgr
---
If that's the case, I think someone needs to remind them that they fired all of the "fix old shit" guys after their last couple failed projects, because they don't seem to realize it.
---
when you are so afraid of him while unable to do anything to stop him.
---
you pray to CCP.
---
There is a growing group of DeafBeans in Horde who play without voice comms at all.
---
If you can listen on voice comms it helps, but it is NOT required by any means.
---
No
---
that's harsh
---
No.  The hysteria caused them to HEAVILY nerf the module variations and the chance to get good mods.  On top of that, Abyssmal space just...isn't particularly good, so it isn't extremely popular.
---
If it had gone live with the original figures that CCP seemed to think were fine, it absolutely would have been a disaster.
---
"Because you can grind in-game for it"
---
Doesn't excuse the shirt and offensive pricing.
---
Wtb new nyx skins
---
pretend you do ;-) 
---
Wasn’t a problem when there were no citadels at all
---
the prices seem nuts to me, but they've been going more and more to this high quality / big $$$ method so it must be working for them.
---
The radon is fine. Sent away and smart people said were good.
---
Just getting tired of a hemogeny of the same voices the same faces the same analysis the same visual and polished formatting. 
---
It is a little sad that it appears there is so much snark when I simply disagree with you plat form. So now answer my question did you start listing to podcasts before or after the Casino war.
---
Idk man.
---
First of all I don't think it's a very complex game. But there definitely is a challenge in designing a UI that let's you be aware of what's going on in full 3D space. I think it even touches on something fundamental human, as we are only wired to interpret a snapshot of what's directly in front of us in a pretty narrow FoV.
---
Second I strongly disagree the interface is very good. Lists and menus and double clicking without a reliable way of hotkeying basic navigation control is very poor. I'm sorry but it just shows lack of imagination if you can't think of anything better. 
---
The one and only these days
---
It depends on the type of NPC.   
---
The typical NPCs (Red Crosses/Ships) that exist in belts/anoms etc. are super old NPCs that will always shoot a player regardless of standings, you could be 10.0 to Blood Raiders and still get shot by random blood npcs on gates, in sites, in belts etc.   
---
The newer diamond style NPCs actually take standings into account. If you have positive standings with them, they will no longer shoot you on site and become neutral, will allow you to exist around their NPC haulers and miners without calling in support and if you have great standings with them diamond NPC logi will actually remote repair you.  
---
Just in case there were some parts you wanted to reread with a nice hot cup of coffee in the morning. 
---
I saw him login right after downtime and had a manticore on scan immediately for like 10 seconds. If he won’t use input broadcasting to cloak them, but logs his alts all in at the same time, there is a reasonable amount of time until he reaches the last bomber, which floats in space unprotected.
---
Of course you won’t go for a single bomber, but in quick swift action you could possibly kill not just one but dozens of bombers if setup correctly. Would keep him busy for some time replacing those.
---
But in light of a possible use of input broadcasting its naturally pretty difficult to catch them.
---
Now come on and tell me he is logging in and cloaking his ships one by one so you won’t catch him anyways, even if he wasn’t to use input broadcasting.
---
This just needs to be investigated by CCP.
---
Then friend you must nano bro.
---
and even if that was the case, ccp would remove it after reddit starts crying about us using it so we probably wouldn't build it anyway
---
No need to undercut - you can just demod him / remove his ban perms. More lucrative that way.
---
The Deafener, Blinder, and Muzzler are super dirty and i love all three!

Yup you can polish like crazy dosen't change what it's made from.

and FW still broken
---
sad times lolzzzzz
---
As long as they're not catching input broadcasting!
---
Last I heard they were struggling because skins are purchased/owned/assigned to an individual while structures belong to/are assigned to a Corp. I haven’t heard anything in a while but I think this was the hangup.
---
The way it’s coded now, I don’t think it’s just as simple as making some skins and adding them to the plex store.
---
Pretty much yup. Kind of disappointing but there's honestly not much to be done to counter it. Stopping playing will lead to more short term profit milking anyway
---
Bit was a joke man lol
---
I will support this action with an Upvote. 😁
---
What's ironic is all the people attacking look the other way when 20 rorquals light a cyno in the same server tick, or all panic/ pull drones in a similar fashion.
---
1. Window management.
---
2. Login for multiple clients. 
---
3 CPU management while running multiple accounts.
---
That's it.
---
What if I told you... That the cringe is from line members trying to hand wave away an entire invasion force and pretend like nothing is going to happen? 
---
I'm teasing you sue.
---
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh, we're trying to wave our pitchforks over here
---
You mods are the only reason I still visit this cesspool.
---
These situations are not correlated.  We want the bota gone to it's just hard because we have so many blues that we don't talk with.
---
They fixed bug when you try to log in and the msg didnt pop up about new Omega 50% discount from 14.99$ to 12.74$.

This is so bad it deserves an upvote.

I'm sad I missed the dos rouvenors skin, it looks pretty good imo

&gt; Imagine if in WoW you could stand in one spot and ore veins would literally appear next to you after 2-3 seconds. You mine the ore. You wait 2 seconds. A new vein literally appears next to you. You mine it. You repeat for 23 hours a day. That's how ratting, and to a lesser extent mining, works in EvE. It would crater any game's economy.
---
It is literally what happens. You say in the same region and move a little bit and wow, here it is, a brand new spawn of herb, ore or whatever. You don't have to change region for infinie ressources in WoW, like it's the case in EVE NS.
---
&gt; Let's face it, infinite sites is bad for the game. You just want it because farming isk is easy and low-effort right now. If it were changed, you'd be forced to expend some effort to make your isk beyond occasionally paying attention to your screen. See? Stupid arguments work both ways.
---
No it's not. This argument is and always will be false. ISKs enable people to buy PvP ships, which create content. Saying that easy ratting is bad for the game is as stupid as saying that the fact people buy PvP ships is stupid.
---
&gt; How people do not understand that this is a major improvement is beyond me. People using more systems in the region they live in? That's good. People moving around? That's good. Each system being able to support fewer 23/7 ratting carriers? That's good. "lol they'd just move around and use more space idiot" is a terrible fucking argument and you should be ashamed that you ever let that thought leave the few folds you have in your brain.
---
So this is your argument ? Insults because I proved that you are wrong and you don't have any other argument at hand ? People won't take more space, or move regions for PvE, because of fucking citadels you moron. 
---
Stfu and complain, buddy
---
Have a good day sir.
---
U N P O P U L A R  O P I N I O N
---
bad bot
---
Well *sure*, they each have their own monetization model but my point was that CCP are following in the footsteps of Wargaming with this pretending that it's OK to charge as much for an ingame asset that didn't take that much work, as other companies charge for their whole entire game.
---
While dudes on Steam sometimes rage over 40$ games being priced at 60$ there's tons of Eve nerds sucking on that 25$-for-a-skin dick and WoT players riding some thick ukranian 40-70$-for-a-tank pole.
---
It's a gate, but you have to Entosis it to power it; the larger the ship you want to pass through, the more ships you need powering it. 
---
Hear that every one? Apparently we are killing the game by winning all our fights and being top dog.
---
well, notably, the combat interceptor nerf came a few months after a pretty sizable buff to assault frigates and the addition of the ADC.  These classes of hulls perform basically the same role, so whichever one the meta doesn't prefer is going to get roughly zero usage.
---
Really? What risks do you take? Practically nothing. You may as well join a highsec wardec corp and fly Catalysts. 
---
" Riverini appeared to have lost his mind in local, spamming during the bash. He just kept spamming, “BUILD THE WALL. BUILD THE WALL” … He is a known Trump supporter. "

---
Hey Man,
---
Evictus Dude here, Sorry you didn't find a home here! If rules or decisions made you feel oppressed here I'm sorry to hear that. Generally these rules are in place to keep the entire team even or safe and to minimally impact everyone's game.
---
Happy to hear you've found a new home and enjoying the game! Not every group is for every person :D.
---
Fly safe and good hunting o7
---
If your testicles look like this, seek immediate medical attention
---
\~claps\~
---
Wish more people understood this... If you aren't happy and don't feel attached, try something new and experiment! If your corp mates and friends wish to forsake you for trying some new gameplay beyond them, fuck those guys. 
---
Enjoy the game you shits!
---
Fuck yea! We're moving on up boys!
---
https://updates.eveonline.com/coming/winter/
---
But yes the holdup you described is why we haven't gotten it sooner.
---
Yep. Abyssal won't really matter until you can muta a cynosural field generator.
---
Yep! I think I confused window management as actually moving the ui in the client around 
---
I don't want wars. I've played eve for almost 14 years, I've been in plenty of wars. They're boring and terrible. We fondly remember the few good fights we get in wars and choose to forget the dozens or hundreds of shitty timers we stay up too late for and tidifests we spend praying for no DC. I want content. 
---
You're literally telling me to adapt or die right before you say you would just walk away if the game changed. Spare me, typical /r/eve hypocrisy. 
---
Also I'm going to buy the skins.  I quite like 'em :p.
---
Buy pkex on market with isk.
---
???????
---
Profit.
---
&gt; It is literally what happens. You stay in the same region and move a little bit and wow, here it is, a brand new spawn of herb, ore or whatever. You don't have to change region for infinie ressources in WoW, like it's the case in EVE NS.
---
Oh, so not the thing I said at all, then. Because in Eve you literally just warp to the new site. It's the Eve equivalent of a new herb spawning literally next to you. In WoW you have to actually make a circuit, where you fly about and pick flowers. That would be the eve equivalent of moving about a constellation or region. On PvP servers, you can be ganked while moving, other people can pick your flowers before you get to them, and it makes the region appear more lived-in as you see people running all over doing things. So, you know, not the fucking same at all. 
---
&gt; No it's not. This argument is and always will be false. ISKs enable people to buy PvP ships, which create content. Saying that easy ratting is bad for the game is as stupid as saying that the fact people buy PvP ships is bad for the game.
---
"Inflation isn't real and you can't convince me"
---
&gt; So this is your argument ? Insults because I proved that you are wrong and you don't have any other argument at hand ? People won't take more space, or move regions for PvE, because of fucking citadels you moron.
---
No, I'm insulting you because you're a smoothbrained idiot
---
Funny, but that still breaks the eula.
---
It doesn't matter if you multiple your inputs over more than 1 client by software or hardware, it's equally against eula.
---
Got a little bored and had to shoot your coalition mates huh?
---
If we just shit up Falcon's and random devs' r/eve experience enough with this rage maybe they'll keep bringing this up in internal meetings. 
---
They damn well know we're mad about bugs, shitty balance in null, low, hs AND j space but are enough of us angry to justify a big CCP effort towards fixing their game?
---
And of course dudes at fanfest can raise these points during Q&amp;As, harvesting mass applause for their trouble.
---
It's just a keylogger. No worries unless you're botting
---
Yes and both of the RL examples that you gave are in no way equivalent to something in a video game. A husband trying to save his pregnant wife's life is not equivalent to creating .1% more content in a video game.  
---
Cheaters should be banned, there are no stipulations on that. He is just as much removing content from the game through his methods as he is creating it.
---
I didn't say I'd walk away if it changed at all.
---
I simply said that if a game isn't interesting, fun, or worth while then I'll play a different game that is.
---
But apart from Jita, local works just fine.
---
Input broadcasting is only against the EULA if it gives you an unfair advantage. Mar5hy has streamed himself input broadcasting to do things like open/configure clients before, which is allowed. Just like I said when the first of dozens of stupid threads about this came up, Mar5hy _should_ be investigated just like anyone who is clearly input broadcasting should be, but I seriously doubt he's illegally input broadcasting - mostly because it confers him exactly zero advantage in his playstyle, cloaky camping. What's he doing, broadcasting a cloak? Broadcasting dscan? I seriously doubt it. But fine, investigate him. Clear evidence of broadcasting deserves investigation - calling for bans is a bit stupid. 
---
But while we're at it, where's the outrage over the rorquals pulling all their excavators on the same server tick? Where's the outrage over input broadcasting hulk fleets? Or are we all selectively getting outraged when people we don't like do things we don't like, and ignoring it when it's our friends? 
---
No bubbles in low sec.
---
HK only had 8 people you monsters!! They were just incredibly talented multi-boxers
---
&gt; The only real content Goon/init/test could get atm is themselves.
---
the last 12 months say you are a liar
---
First of all, not everybody has to take a risk. Risk is must only be inherent to PvE activities. For example, Rorqual miners and Super ratters must take a risk for the macroeconomical health of this game. For others, risk is just a personal decision. For example, Goonswam hasn't put trillions on field in any war in which there is a risk of losing. "Helldunk or blueballs" is your official motto. And that's totally fine. Risk aversion is only a problem when krabs do it.
---
Secondly, to speak of my personal choices, I do take big risks for fun. [Here](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004713/201812051700/) is an example which I solo (1 person multiboxing) dropped 8 dreads in direct range of your titans, and [here](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004713/201812120300/) is another in which I lost those dreads. That's more than any Goon can say. Your alliance is filthy rich with more than 600 titans, and I've never seen a Goon solo dropping a titan outside direct range of other capitals and friends.
---
So when you tell me about my risk aversion, it's only your inferiority complex speaking.
---
Cause they clearly don't live in this one rofl
---
  **Valk kicked Sue last year just days before his one-year corp anniversary for shooting blues in an NPSI fleet.**   
---
No one kicked me I left for personal reasons and who said I was shooting blue's lol

He regularly loses booshing dessies lol what are you talking about? He's losing ships all the time. He's clearly taking risks. Just because he's making a profit off Goon drones doesn't mean there is no risk.
---
Yes obviously
---
You're the hater troll. Why involve yourself at all in our community? GTFO. You oughta be banned in my opinion, you don't belong here.
---
Well yea but the only things that are allowed are:  
---
 •	EVE Online client settings   
---
•	Window positions and arrangements (of the EVE Online client in your operating system’s desktop environment)  
---
•	The login process    
---
Chatting would be under:  
---
 •	Interaction with other characters  
---
Which is against the rules. So even the least offensive form of his input broadcasting still very much falls under the "bannable offense" category.
---
I for one support this guy!!! SUE is the citadel hero we need!!!
---
 **Going Forward**  
---
[As of 15th of March 2013](http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/begun-the-bot-war-has/) we have been policing input automation based on a two-strike policy  
---
•	1st strike for input automation is a 30 day ban  
---
•	2nd strike for input automation is a permanent ban  
---
**Input Automation remains strictly prohibited, and is policed under our suspension and ban policy.**

You will have plenty of people defend mar5hy because has a shit load of cloaky alts and provides content (easy ganks) for many groups. On the other hand the null bears who hate him will sperg out in this thread and others. 
---
Savage...but true
---
Shit i'll give you 100 just to have more stories like this
---
''OMG'' how dare you
---
No, actually, some input broadcasting is allowed: 
---
&gt; Input Broadcasting and Input Multiplexing of actions with consequences in the EVE universe, are prohibited and will be policed in the same manner as Input Automation. 
---
This includes, but isn’t limited to:
---
•	Activation and control of ships and modules
---
•	Navigation and movement within the EVE universe
---
•	Movement of assets and items within the EVE universe
---
•	Interaction with other characters
---
Examples of allowed Input Broadcasting and Input Multiplexing are actions taken that do not have an impact on the EVE universe and are carried out for convenience:
---
•	EVE Online client settings 
---
•	Window positions and arrangements (of the EVE Online client in your operating system’s desktop environment)
---
•	The login process

Obviously at this time and age, the only true useful AT gift would be an improved Rorqual with like double mining yield bonus.
---
The main people whining about Jita Local being broken will be the fucks that ran constant chat spam bots in there. 
---
My mom would be proud.
---
Why not just adapt, though
---
null bois need wands to plex, fw doesn't. there's no difference other than that. pretending that any part of this game is anything other than a faceroll is dumb. the real magic comes from the interactions you get with other people, and this faceroll promises a bunch of that.
---
Might have story in 9hours when this one onlines :P
---
I don't need to.
---
What would work well is if they gave the combat interceptors some kind of short burst speed module so you could burn at an enemy quickly to light tackle.
---
I mean if the game changes - why not just follow your own advice? Adapt? Or you would just walk away?
---
Because walking away is what most pvp'ers are doing right now, and the ubiquitous response from you and others is that they're whiners who should just adapt.
---
OOF
---
Wtb Brony skins
---
Weird flex but okay.
---
Can I have some of what you're smoking?
---
We've been through this, I don't need to adapt.
---
I'm not quitting eve over this, like most of the salty Pvpers claim they are.
---
they are differend metas but dont actually differ in any way
---
I did an experiment yesterday and rolled 5 Entropic Radiation Sinks, 2 Gist X-type X-Large Shield Boosters, 2 Gyros, 5 Caldari Navy BCU (got one to be better then officer mods), 2 Heat sinks, 2 Core X-type 100mn AB's.
---
I spent around 4.5bil just to see what would happen.
---
About 70% of those mods were bricked (One of the X-Large shield boosters FUCKK)
---
The mods that came out ahead were actually pretty damn good.
---
&gt;&gt; Entropic Radiation Sink thing had a 7% ROF and 1.14 Damage with only 25 CPU.
---
&gt;&gt;BCU - 32 CPU (negative affect) 14% missile Damage and 13.7 ROF increase
---
&gt;&gt;X-Large Shield booster - Higher PG, but more Shield Repped 3.92 cycle time.
---
If i end up selling these, ill be isk Positive, the issue is there is a tiny market for it
---
Ah I remember fleets when the FC would mess up and land us in a broadsword bubble, just to get immediately wiped by some dude 10j away
---
Lies
---
Jesus christ it's like talking to a toddler
---
*In the event that combat and mining anom spawn mechanisms were changed to be like wormholes* would you quit playing eve or adapt?
---
I am everywhere
---
wormholer btw lol
---
Thera isn't even a wormhole btw
---
who shot the jews
---
&gt; It could be fired from the ship or through a cyno. And by that I mean they would press a button in one system, the doomsday effect would take place in another system so long as there was a connecting cyno.
---
And technically, as in UI?
---
I mean, how did you configure the DD to go through a cyno instead of firing locally? Some rightclick menu on your hull?
---
And did it really work across systems? I only heard of same system cyno DDs tbh.
---
It might be me not understanding what goon is doing right now. Last I heard, you (and god knows how many other entity looking for content) are in germinate doing subcap brawls with horde. Don't get me wrong I'm sure your having fun. But I don't see this as being the next big war of 2019. You might not be killing the game but you sure aren't helping PC gamer write a new article on eve . Also, congratz on being top dogs, now entertain me!
---
What exactly do you mean by scope of the overview? 
---
As in what is shown on it? If so then it depends what overview filter you have setup. 
---
handful of nyxes too, but no not a real super fleet, in fact I'm really puzzled why they even bothered
---
this is me making fun of progod for blurfing about having an armor super fleet, and dinoposters biting pretty hard on it
---
Go read my posts.
---
I stated exactly what I'd do. It isn't a mystery. 
---
&gt;  Yes and both of the RL examples that you gave are in no way equivalent to something in a video game. A husband trying to save his pregnant wife's life is not equivalent to creating .1% more content in a video game.
---
Those RL examples are analogies to show the principle he is basing his claims is flawed. I won't get into details of how logic and reasoning works with you, but analogies are not supposed to be fully equivalent cases. As long as you can offer an example a principle does not work, it means it shouldn't work in other similar cases.
---
&gt;  Cheaters should be banned, there are no stipulations on that.
---
When it comes to banning broadcasters, CCP should prioritize those who use it unfairly in PvP and those who use it to make money. These areas are why broadcasting was banned in the first place. Meanwhile, one time accidents are not important. If he was using broadcasting only legally and had a single accident (which did not benefit him in any way), I wouldn't even call him a 'cheater'. That'd be like you calling me someone murderer for accidentally slightly bumping someone with a car (causing no damage whatsoever).
---
&gt;  He is just as much removing content from the game through his methods as he is creating it.
---
How so?
---
There are real highlights. How you can drag+drop fits, fleets, chat channels etc. to chat, mail or notebook. How you can copy fittings from the fitting tool to the Windows clipboard and get a human readable text out of it, which can be pasted back on another client. Just as examples. I don't know any other game, which does such magic.
---
Of course nothing is perfect. But there is a lot to break. If you have a good but not perfect system to start with, a complete overhaul is not a good idea. Better continue to improve it in small steps.
---
I think it's intentional, that you can't hotkey navigation completely - probably to stop the simplest forms of "botting" like "put something heavy on the jump gate key for a fast autopilot".
---
what do you get when you consume too much spod? 
---
&gt; asic miner
---
GOD DAMIT :P
---
Slight correction - the doomsday via a cyno had to be within the same system as the titan. However you could quite happily sit the titan a few metres outside of a POS shield, light a cyno on a frigate 50AU away and fire it under zero risk.
---
Why are you avoiding niarja? It's a good system
---
Because you could exit from any point on a starbase.
---
dddooooOOOOOGGHHH don’t steal the wind from my sails bro! DONT DO IT!!
---
Right, you'd log in, run the sites in your system like dailies, and log out. You wouldn't adapt at all, and I wouldn't even feel a tiny bit bad over you earning a tiny fraction of the isk you earned with infinitely respawning sites. 
---
This is a very reasonable response you're pretending we will just accept. It seems very likely that this is what you would do, and not at all like you're just saying this is what you would do. If this is adapting, then I guess all those salty PvP'ers have already adapted.
---
So tracking and optimal bonuses (maybe drone speed/tracking for Taranis) without increasing damage?
---
"hella lucrative" 
---
Golf clap
---
I've changed how i play in response to a change in mechanics. That's adapting, mate.
---
I mean whats the maximum distance it's shown. 
---
I'm not asking if you _have_ adapted. I'm asking if you _would_ adapt or if you'd walk away if something as drastic as changing anom spawn mechanisms to those of wh anoms took place. You seem to want to stick with your story of logging in every day to earn a hundred mil or so from the sites in your system before going to play another game - good thing this change will literally never happen so that doesn't get put to the test, huh?
---
Remember starting out in Solitude back in 2008. Kinda want to go back now after 10 years out of Eve...
---
&gt; In case he logs into his accounts and cloaks all of them at the same time thus being ready in an instant and not being threatened to get scanned out.
---
&gt; Isn‘t this an major time advantage and mechanism to keep his assets safe?
---
Logging in is legal. Cloaking would be against the EULA. We don't know whether he was cloaking. That'd save him 5-10 minutes every day. It's not a MAJOR advantage imho. If he was also cloaking, I wouldn't blame CCP for temporary banning him. But it really doesn't matter nearly as much as PvE or PvP broadcasters, and doesn't deserve all this Goon propagandist hype.
---
I told you what I would do, several times.
---
I'm beginning to suspect that CCP might only have a graphics department and nothing else
---
In game customer service? CCP? This is some sort of trick.
---
&gt;null bois need wands to plex, fw doesn't. there's no difference other than that. 
---
Sure, aside from FW complex hull restrictions, FW complexes being deadspace, LP stores, the lack of bubbles, lack of aoe doomsdays, security status, gate guns, filthy neutrals who can dock in system, and the mentioned lack of sov wands, Lowsec and Nullsec are identical. :rolleyes:

---
So when you said this 
---
&gt; input broadcasting person === input broadcasting person
---
You were either lying, ignorant, or omitting context. Not all input broadcasting people are equivalent. Just like I've said in other comments Mar5hy should be investigated for obviously input broadcasting, but if he accidentally left it on, whatever. Accidents happen, there are rules in place and CCP has a two strike system for a reason. If he's cheating, they'll find out. But blanket saying that anyone who input broadcasts is the same is mixing people who manage lots of accounts with people who multibox 40 rorquals with input broadcasting, and is pants-on-head stupid.
---
yes. send isk. don't tell the police!
---
So what is it that you specifically suggest? Because nothing between planet and heaven will convince any group to spread their supercapital umbrella. 
---
Even if we simply removed all capitals, delve would still be the safest place to rat and mine, because we'd be the ones with most organisation and consolidation of force as long as "the other side" wants to be king of their own molehill instead of merge together. 
---
PS: If the entire northern collection of coalitions merged they'd suddenly have the numbers to hunt in delve. Sure they'd get bosoned a lot but an alliance that size would afford to trade t1 hulls for kills and content without commiting morale seppuku every time they get a red killboard. 
---
football and basketball have different rules but they're both sports with balls. the differences don't matter as much as the people that play the game. that's why we don't watch cpu vs cpu games. the real game comes out in how people play eachother. that's what i'm getting at. :rolltide:
---
I agree that they don't have to be fully equivalent but you can't make totally unrelated comparisons. Same way I can't say shooting someone is sometimes justified because hitting someone is sometimes justified, those aren't equivalent enough. There's obviously a whole discussion that could be had there on the merit of arguing the absurd but I really don't feel it applies here.  
---
Also looking at the methods you can \*legally\* use broadcasting I really don't see how this would be a one time accident. Maybe getting caught was, but I very much doubt he was just using it to:  
---
&gt;Examples of allowed Input Broadcasting and Input Multiplexing are actions taken that do not have an impact on the EVE universe and are carried out for convenience:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;•	EVE Online client settings   
---
•	The login process  
---
From my understanding he was potentially using it for cloaky camping and mining, both of those pretty obviously remove content from other players although I'd agree that cloaky camping is probably the more likely of the two to cause content disruption. If the players in those systems aren't undocking and they have no chance of catching his cloaky because they are all cloaking the second he logs in, then I feel that definitely reduces content in that area.  
---
Now I do feel like there is an argument to be made that there isn't real proof that he was using it for in-game purposes, but that's not the argument you're making. You're saying that even if he was he shouldn't be banned because he creates content, I think that's totally mislead even if I understand the positives of what you're saying. If the rule was that you could bot in HS that would at least be a universal rule, having a rule as subjective as "you can bot/broadcast if you create content" is insane and would be impossible to quantify for anything other than the most known players. And at that point you might as well just say "well known players and alliance leads can do whatever they want because they created a group that makes content, everyone else play by the rules" which is insane.
---
I got a kill with my titans doomsday Weapon for the first time on a target that actually died to its volley the first try. Felt super good lol. I’ve used it before over the passed year but more or less just takes normal caps into low armor. 🥴
---
and who will replace papa stain?
---
&gt;Progodlegend said, “I didn’t even know this was happening. We took the day off to krab."
---
Just like every other day amirite
---
I've already suggested a good change. Spread alliances out by decreasing the number of ratters and miners individual systems can permanently support. My preferred vehicle would be to change anom spawn mechanics. 
---
Hint: getting bosoned a lot isn't fun and people don't roam delve because it isn't worth the effort. It isn't a question of pure numbers, and you pretending it is is bad.
---
I agree with you man sov 0.0 and all the rules, politics, and back room deals gets very stale very quickly. Come visit Solitude every once in a while and say hi to us freeloading BUMS. :)

I give BjornBee 1st in class for most insincere laugh.

Actually after being on coms the other night I was going to make a compilation of insincere laughs.  You know, people laughing at the FC's joke in that ingratiating "ah that was funny" kind-of way.  There's also milegage in a sounds-most-like-a-chimpanzee-or-bonobo laugh compilation.  I may do both.  
---
I'll probably do neither.  I can't be bothered.
---
I'm sure that took more brainpower than what would be acceptable.  But you're so proud, so I'll let it slide. 
---
But why
---
Well meme'd
---
Honestly, though - CCPLs, ship name AND type displayed in the hangar, and hangar labels
---
It's annoying that I have to choose between giving my ship a name and never being able to find it in the hangar, or just having everything called "Doctrine - Tech Level - Ship type".
---
If I could look at my hangar and see:
---
Muninn  
---
T2 AB Doctrine  
---
The Gankinator
---
That would be *wonderful*.
---
Ok cool 
---
Depends on the grid size. Here is an explanation from CCP about grid size 
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/grid-sizes-you
---
Some things of course are seen on the overview throughout the entire system. But besides that it is determined by the size of the grid. 
---
Stop botting.
---
Something not being mentioned in everyone's recollections was Doomsday iteration 1 and 2 hit the entire grid.  It was not like the current Bosons, which are much, much smaller.
---
FSS is ~40mil and you can do them in under 10 minutes in a Rattlesnake including warp times. With enough sites you can easily hit 6 an hour. ~240mil/hr excluding setup time of rolling for good krabholes/prepping krabholes is more than carrier ratting in null.
---
I'm being flair baited ree.
---
So you bring a full dps ship and a full cap stable logi, and they just focus on the dps? sounds good to me
---
Will do.  Havent been in high sec a lot but i Will find it. And say hi 
---
You know the reason we're in Geminate fucking with Horde is that we crushed everybody else in that group and Horde is the only one that still forms to fight right?
---
Imperium/Legacy is so uncontested right now they could probably bash everybody else's citadels if they could get people to for for all those timers without going crazy.
---
You don't understand the politics right now clearly
---
Bjorn genuinely seems to have fun with the game/his antics, I'd say. I don't think his good mood is him being insincere, he's just a positive person. 
---
Far too jolly for my taste, but good on him, tbh
---
Sure those are nice. Calling those magic is overstating it to say the least though.
---
If you don't think the ui is fundamentally in a very bad state you just haven't played long enough. To give you one example; try to use number keys as hotkeys and see what happens. 
---
Also yeah, I do think it's intentional as well. It's because of the 1 sec update architecture. You can't easily make a responsive UI with that so they kinda half arsed the hotkeys.
---
Are you going to follow me around until I stop hurting your feelings? 
---
&gt;Goon flair irony activate

If he loses that enthusiasm, Hilmar's goons are in the next room ready to reeducate him about the merits of EVE.
---
Skilled devs don't want to leave their lives behind to live in Iceland on terrible salaries, unfortunately. Even worse when your job is sorting out 15 year old spaghetti code that nobody at the company understands.
---
I think more to the point is CCP needs to stop being so shit at their patch note releases. Every single patch, half the crap they changed isn't even on the patch note list. People say "read the patchnotes," and I do, and I still only have half the information
---
Get [this one](https://i.imgur.com/seKejnO.png) too
---
No, it is not skins. 
---
It's actually made by a Dev isn't it? Not to mention free
---
Also worth mentioning was that grids were 250km cubes. And if you crossed the invisible line you disappeared to the enemy. Lead to some real fucky sniper bs fights 
---
All faction capital BPCs should be purchasable in the LP store, not just the Serpentis ones &gt;:(
---
Ah yes. The good old days of grid-fu!
---
&gt;Back when CCP still had somewhat intelligent developers, they saw how terrible AOE doomsdays were for nullsec.
---
Uh....those developers created those AOE doomsdays.
---
I'm literally not following you.
---
&gt; Yes it is. It is an improvement
---
Your goal:  Make it possible to attack ratters/miners in nullsec.
---
Result of your change:  More of nullsec is covered by effective capital response fleets.
---
That is not an improvement.
---
i literally have no reason to lie.
---
Anyone remember the advanced audio changes? We're still pushing to get that overhaul revamped. It's been more then a year. 
---
Grrrrrrr.
---
and nobody forced ccp to give them offensive prices.
---
just because i don't have to buy them doesn't mean i have to pretend they're a bargain when they're hilariously expensive to the point of being insulting.
---
Infact, Goons were one of the last large alliance to adopt them.
---
alliance in Scalding pass were using them almost immediately after the nerf to Entosis ceptor. Arty Claws were amazingly effective at chasing down 500mn ships and breaking their weak tank
---
One of my early lessons in Eve. Also he posted once about his shoes on here and I don't understand what shoes has to do with internet spaceships so I downvote everything he does in this subreddit now

Thx 4 inspiration
---
Counterpoint: I feel very at home.  
---
To the topic, using comms is ideal, but you can get by without it. If you're not hard of hearing, you'll want to sit in a quiet channel anyway. Nobody will bother you, but you'll get an important update if it comes up.
---
It says a lot about somebody that they can make Gobbins look good by comparison
---
Thing is, that worked even with the fix, just had to make sure the DPS ship was sniper fit and aligned. I used to do serp 10/10 with an Ishtar tank and a nado gank fit (actually, an alpha pvp fit.)
---
Ishtar grabs pocket agro, kills the small tackler frigs with hobs or hammerheads. Switches to guarden or warden for the cruisers/BC rats and then the nado warps in and pops all the BSes...
---
bob bless you
---
&gt;If you are part of an alliance with more then 800 members, there is a good chance in the last 20 days you have been part of a 2-4 hour OP with nothing more then a citadel kill to show for it.
---
i've also been on many &gt;2hr ops that have yielded killmails, and expensive killmails at that.
---
know what the great thing about alliances with &gt;800 members is? there's so many people around that they can offer more content than you can shake a stick at so there's always something interesting to take part in.
---
being part of big groups give me access to all sorts of shit that i've never done while being part of smaller entities, and more frequent access to stuff that i was already familiar with.
---
if you're bored - maybe you should join a big group that can consistently offer you a myriad of content?
---
My alliance only has 799 members, guess we need to recruit 1 more person before i can leave
---
Wut
---
But we won't spread out even if anoms spawn slower. The umbrella will still be where it is, all focused, so that we maximize the odds of having enough force to squash dreadbombs in any timezone. There's actually mathematics that back up this line of thought, its the Lanchester's Square law, used by military all over the world. 
---
&gt; Hint: getting bosoned a lot isn't fun and people don't roam delve because it isn't worth the effort. It isn't a question of pure numbers, and you pretending it is is bad. 
---
The reason we boson you is because you don't think its fun. If you thought something else was less fun by simply establishing a culture that doesn't take a morale hit from getting bosoned, then we'd have to do something else to keep you away. 
---
Ships and alts are cheaper than ever to make, and while umbrellas are bigger than ever your force as a hunter should be bigger than ever. But you still take as big a morale hit from losing each ship as you did five years ago so then a few bosons later you stop coming. How on Earth are we not supposed to take advantage of that as long as you let us affect your behavior? 
---
After. 
---
What’s wrong with polish? 
---
" The moment you let loose the shackles of your opressors you call "FC", the sooner you being the fun act of learning to actually pilot your ship"
---
I asked my FC but he said no.
---
That's honestly too high quality to be xenuria tbh
---
Did you just prove my point? You guys have steamrolled in 2018 through anything that could give you somewhat of a challenge. Now your stuck doing mallers vs caracals with an alliance that is known for recruiting new players and providing cheap accessible content. You just said it, they are the only ones that are left wanting to fight you. Again, as a simple spectator that wants to see big stuff go boom, who, other than yourself, can provide a real challenge?
---
&gt; Explain to me the advantage of input broadcasting on cloaky campers then, please?
---
Why?  For this to be at all relevant, he would have had to bother setting up input broadcasting *only for chat*.
---
The fact is there was input broadcasting.  You not understanding what he uses it for doesn't change that setting it up *only for chat* is idiotic.
---
&gt; You have proof he used it in chat. 
---
You appear to have confused this for a courtroom.  It isn't.
---
&gt; His cloaky campers are the only real "counter" to the STUPID AS FUCK design of having local chat/intel programs linked to monitoring local.
---
Only if the locals are morons.  It really doesn't take long to figure out when the cloaky guy is active and when he's not.
---
Also, take away local and you get intel bots parked near the gates.
---
Go to belt find npc miners watch for hauler scan hualer down at sotiyo
---
Other than not being a hypocrite, sure.
---
One way to tip you off is to find a constellation where you can see the diamond rats in the belts or on your d-scan window. If you found them in a stationless system (NPC station to be specific) you're on the right track. Following that, if you see a diamond hauler (Bustard/Badger, or Impel/Bestower) you are also on the right track; drop combats, find the diamond rats, and cloak up near them. Watch for a hauler, and when it warps off, start scanning for it then. If you're super lucky, what you'll find is the Sotiyo in system, but that is not necessarily a given. If it is not in system, expand your search to the rest of the constellation.
---
Keep in mind that only a few faction Sotiyos are active in space at any given time. There's maybe 2-3 of each type currently active, but may be fewer as well. **MAKE SURE TO WARP CLOAKED TO THESE SOTIYOS** otherwise you will have a very bad experience as the 100 rats sitting on it will murder you for the audacity to exist.
---
The amount of Sotiyos active at any one time is kind of obfuscated by CCP, there's rumors that there are 2 of both Gurista and BR sotiyos active in lowsec, and others are active scattered throughout nullsec as well. Some of them are not run just because the space is too hostile (gl clearing one in Curse or Great Wildlands, or places like Stain/Fountain without anyone who lives there not noticing you). CCP has purposefully kept their numbers/spawn patterns obfuscated so there's no effective guide at figuring it out. You just gotta do some big legwork to get them and then cheese the Sotiyo with LR titans and supers.
---
So... You just want the big boys to fight for you to watch?
---
Pathetic
---
Cap stable scimi with HG Halos, deadspace booster and afterburner... Orbit the DPS and tank the room if you have to, lol. Put in a set of small drones in the scimi so it's even pulling it's own weight.

Those large kills you got, or expensive ones. Do you feel like you were a real impact on it?
---
If you are one of the hunters for a large alliance, an FC or a great tackle, sure. You are impactful.
---
Most members of a large alliance though are F1 pushers. They fly in Cerbs or Moas or whatever, they try to anchor, and shoot at the right primary. Is that the definition of Impactful Gameplay. Or are they simply just a slave to their FC's/Command structure and do as they are told with little to no mental fortitude?
---
quickly!
---
You have his d so into you that if you open your mouth we might be able to see it.
---
Also, feel free to explain why he'd go through the effort of setting up input broadcasting, but only for chat.  And only during one stream.  'Cause what you are claiming is he did that, and does not use input broadcasting any other time.
---
&gt; Do you feel like you were a real impact on it?
---
I got on a killmail, that's fine for me.
---
i don't need to be front and centre to enjoy myself. i'm not the little 6 year old that spent the afternoon crying because he wasn't cast as joseph in the nativity, i was fine just chilling out as a wise man.
---
&gt; But we won't spread out even if anoms spawn slower.
---
Then you won't make as much isk, simple as that. That's a fine outcome, too. 
---
&gt; The reason we boson you is because you don't think its fun.
---
The reason no one wants to roam delve is also because it's not fun. We're in agreement. The mechanics that make that activity completely risk-free for you are the problem. I'm not asking you to defend your space less well, no matter how fun that would be for us. I'm just pointing out that the structure of the game right now makes it unbelievably safe for you to drop supers and titans on a whim, and enables many, many more people to have such ships. Changing anom spawn rate would help mitigate that. Stop making this about "hurr pvp'ers just want us to pull our punches cause they can't adapt." No one said that. You made it up and are now arguing against it as if I've been saying it all along. 
---
&gt;I am a firm believer in Chaos.
---
Would you say it's some kind of climbing tool?
---
by buying skins you give them money, so there is no incentive to fix the game if they can just make up the "lost" profits from those that quit the game due to the fact that it's in a worse state than quite a few Early Access games.
---
If stain got removed from the game, would anyone miss it?
---
So you want goons to continue to stomp beaten alliances into the ground instead of letting them rebuild because that will somehow create content? The fuck is wrong with you?
---
i've literally been hypocritical about nothing mate.
---
some one suggested a change, i just pointed out a likely result of the change.
---
wat
---
That is fine and all, but you can not say you are "Good" at eve
---
You simply just exist.
---
&gt;&gt; You are basically an accountant for a large successfull group and call yourself good.
---
i get it, we all pay our subs to play the game the way we want to. However you are never able to say "I am good at eve and understand it"
---
so thats fine
---
I have been on a single Bomber's Bar fleet. Hated it. Just more f1 pushing. I am not defending the person. I am saying this method of reddit posting to force a ban isn't the appropriate mechanism. 
---
Cracks forming?
---
*Grabs popcorn*
---
&gt; but you can not say you are "Good" at eve
---
i don't need to - all i need to say is that i enjoy the time i spend playing eve.
---
I'm sorry we form for fleets everyone tell mittens we are all going to world of warships for real pvp content.
---
I would say you but I get the feeling you don't think *ever*
---
because i have a black battle heron and a red shiny heron and i can't call them the same name otherwise i have to fit each one to see what they are. or i have to give them stupid names like "thisonesexplorer" and "thisoneistank". thank god i don't have 10 herons doing different shit. yes, it is a very niche request, but for the average player would be a great improv while for the collectionneurs would be funtastic. 
---
Yeah that is totally fine, this post wasnt directed at high sec guys like you.
---
It was for the people that feel like their time is wasted. You keep doing you! :)
---
Multiple parts due to youtube's rules for new accounts. this is the long term save of the roundtable for anyone that missed it. 
---
the primary focus is the talk with people who are active in the war deccing community and provide an opportunity for CSM to hear their concerns and ideas for moving the war dec mechanic forward
---
then get stomped by bots that come to jam/kill you
---
He enjoys the attention, not the gameplay, like most streamers.
---
sure thing - i'm just presenting the other side of the coin; that i've never felt like i've been able to fill my time so well and have so little of it going to waste!
---
eve is what you make of it, i guess!

&gt;Analogy and Analogical Reasoning  
---
&gt;*First published Tue Jun 25, 2013*  
---
&gt;An *analogy* is a comparison between two objects, or systems of objects, that **highlights respects in which they are thought to be similar.** *Analogical reasoning* is any type of thinking that relies upon an analogy. **An** ***analogical*** ***argument*** **is an explicit representation of a form of analogical reasoning that cites accepted similarities between two systems to support the conclusion that some further similarity exists.** In general (but not always), such arguments belong in the category of inductive reasoning, since their conclusions do not follow with certainty but are only supported with varying degrees of strength. Here, ‘inductive reasoning’ is used in a broad sense that includes all inferential processes that “expand knowledge in the face of uncertainty” (Holland et al. 1986: 1), including[abductive inference](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/abduction/).
---
Emphasis mine.
---
I need a volunteer army XD.
---
&gt;And buy more SKINs.
---
when they are sold for a reasonable price, i would gladly purchase them.
---
Insincere? I'd rather say ~~psychop~~[very revealing](https://www.twitch.tv/bjornbee/clip/EndearingAstuteLlamaMingLee).
---
But in a sympathetic way.
---
Good post Wally.  Still not sure how so many people get satisfaction from anchoring and pressing f1. 
---
To the edit: Lol there will never be a Massively or Kotaku article for the guy who single handedly stole over a trillion by using 100 characters. With all the established connections even these news sites become part of Goon propaganda machine.
---
How long have you been horde?
---
if you're joining specifically for the purpose of having the most warm bodies to ping to fill your fleets as fast as possible... just join the biggest one.
---
This is true, but it's also hard to find those people to do the same thing. If you want to build your own corp, you need to figure out logistics, recruitment, where to live, isk making, etc. Not everyone has JF and 40bil in wallet to invest into basic stuff. And why the hell would anyone join you if they can join any other small groups like that.
---
And then you can join such a group, but it's hard to tell them from anything unless you've fought them, but then again they might have spend the last 3h gate camping. You can look up a KB and someones reputation but it's not that obvious. Also need to find proper TZ because small groups do generally have a strong TZ and a small to desertic other.
---
That being said, I agree with you. I'm a corp hopper, I've switch corp every 3 to 6 months, sometimes back to former corp because once I get bored of something, well I'd rather move on than quite the game. It's been a great learning experience. I've for sure am loosing some isk and leaving assets a bit everywhere in the process, but that's worth it.
---
Take your fucking upvote and get the hell out.
---
and being spread out wouldn't matter the current mechanics would still allow them to defend what they held, sure there'd be more people dying to droppers but the sov wouldn't be threatened.
---
"look at me mummy", is all I'm seeing.
---
You know similarity is different than equivalence right?
---
Counterpoint: Join one corporation, and never leave it under any circumstances. Don't be a wishy washy Johnny-Come-Lately; commit to something.
---
I said the opposite. My message states that the only real challenge for INIT/TEST/GOON (I see) is each other. why did I even bother trying to make a point on this reddit, I only have myself to blame for this...o7
---
I have FC'd in eve for over 6 years.
---
I have done Large Scale alliance ops, small Alliance ops, small gang, bombing runs, Spectre fleet. I have loved FCing at every level
---
&gt; Always have a real interceptor
---
If the ship your Interceptor pilot is flying isnt a Stiletto or Malediction, he is in the wrong ship.
---
All inties should have a scram and disruptor. Also, they MUST have something to increase lock range. Either a singal amp or a Small Ionic Tech 2 rig.
---
&gt; Have a plan
---
Nothing is worse then letting someone FC and when someone asks "what are we doing" The FC says "no idea"
---
Check Dotlan to see where people are ratting the most. Use Eve-scout to check for roamable Thera holes.
---
Hell, even a "we are gonna RF this groups Athanor and farm the response fleet" is a good enough objective.
---
&gt; Know the weakpoints of your fleet.
---
Flying a kitey comp? Huginns/Rapiers and Lokis just became #1 worst enemy.
---
What to know what is nearly as bad as being Webbed in a kite ship? Not being able to lock past 20KM.
---
Kill all damp bonused ships second, if noone is in danger of being scrammed. 
---
&gt;&gt; Keres/Lach/Arazu&gt;Celestis&gt;Maulus
---
Keeping that in mind will keep the kite dps doing its job.
---
&gt; Make doctrines
---
Getting familiar with ships potential by fitting them and trying different fits is one of the best way to know what you fleet is capable of.
---
Are you flying Nomens? Then you know 40km is a great spot to be for decent DPS. However you also know that a Jaguar with double Ancil is one of the nastiest ships to the fleet comp since it has high resists, an ADC and the potential to lock someone down for 12 seconds easily. BRING EC-300 DRONES IN NOMENS.
---
These are just small pointers, the chore of learning to FC is very far reaching and has lessons to be learned for months, if not years to come.
---
I wish you the best
---
evemail me: Fastj002.
---
I mainly fly a Rapier w/ Recon 5
---
Ok bye.
---
Protip:  If you're sitting in a 2 hour citadel bash fleet and don't have an alt account (or 5) doing something more interesting, you're doing it wrong. 
---
I know not everyone has or can afford alt accounts, at least at first, but it's something you should look into. If you train them into a specific purpose (like VNI ratting, explo, ganking, etc) and then convert them to skill farms after they finish training the accounts are basically free from that point onward. 
---
Satisfaction is the output. Anchoring and F1 is the input. That's why you're having trouble understanding.
---
are you looking to fly with me? If so, i fly from 0000-0400 :) I will evemail you
---
I’d recommend joining Horde and jumping on any Travis Keikira fleet if he’s still active. He’s incredibly good at leading newbie fleets and patient even when faced with outrageous incompetence. I’ve never heard him rage once at anyone. There are FC’s who may have a reputation but are total tryhards and make their fleets zero fun, Travis makes the game what it should be - fun, and when leading newbies it’s important they feel like if they fuck up it’s not the end of the world. The key to being a good FC in my opinion is not just being a good content creator but being someone who people respect because they aren’t some ragelord, although they can be quite entertaining and like bad kids at school we used to take great delight in trying to trigger certain FC’s into meltdown. 
---
Thats fine and all, but should people really stay in karma fleet or altruism for 2 years?
---
Am I having fun?
---
Yes.
---
I am, therefore, good at Eve, because Eve is a game, and having fun is the only goal.
---
Or laugh in the sadistic voice of a Kikimora as your 512 tracking score at 48km lets you 2 shot any light drone, 3 shot mediums and 4 shot heavies.
---
Thank you, more people need to realize that this game isnt all about being 1 of 5k people of a group.
---
Tempting...
---
What makes you think there aren't priorities in game development and those priorities are where the budget for hiring and raises and shit goes?
---
&gt;have been hitting up low sec **and null sec space** now.
---
You really have no idea what Karmafleet is, do you?
---
Even if Gobbins is shit he's still better than you. He doesn't force himself upon the community and fill it with constant droning narcissism
---
I just give a path to get into the wh.
---
Great post, really hits the nail on the head here
---
You guys only get SRP on strat fleets don't lie. Also everybody else has the new structures too
---
Yeah, not all small gang corps need that JF though.
---
For instance, there are groups that live 1j from highsec in low that form daily to get content.
---
These groups visit Brave/Horde/Test and farm their fleet members daily taking little to no losses.
---
Now, if anyone things small gang pilots dont PVE, they are sadly mistaken. Many small gang pilots have PVE alts that run incursions (I have 2) or run Abyssal Tier 4-5's (1 for that) or do high end missions (4)
---
Those activities pay for themselves and also open the door to multiboxing in fleets. Everyone loves having a Bifrost/Sabre in every single fleet, and they are very simple to multibox. :)
---
A small gang corp can literally exist with 4-6 real people. It wont be hard for that group to make a name for themselves very quickly. Especially if they pick on a large alliance every day and make their life hell. So what if you feed 4-6 Osprey navies? You just made that alliance competely shift gears for 2 weeks because  you RF'd 1/8th of their SOV.
---
I think the dichotomy of either "great small gang" or "mouth-breathing F1 pusher" is kind-of tired.
---
There are a whole lost of experiences inbetween, some of them not advisable or even possible unless you're in a large alliance.
---
Rackets are complicated and Horde wasn't actually getting all the profit from HS, they were getting protection payments from iChooseYou
---
We had a ton of fun last year! Just look at all these smiling faces [from last year!](http://www.everetreat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IMG_20180602_190958.jpg) . If anyone from CCP would be interested in attending I can make some arrangements for tickets and such. 
---
How about scratch that second part and just keep the profits.
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/59351505/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/59351505/)  
---
There you go.
---
Recruiting corp for Goons, people generally join it since it is newbie friendly.
---
My point was, you cant say that people should join one corp and never leave under any circumstance, because there are lilly pad corps out there.
---
did you want to leave highsec and venture to nullsec to learn? These recruitment corps are one of the best ones to join to get a feel.
---
Want to do MORE with your knowledge? You wont be able to use the new gained knowledge in some newbie friendly corp, time to join a different one to be able to.
---
Don't really like salvaging for 2 m per site lol. I don't think I can run multiple vnis. What do I use gilas for? Ratting? I usually like more afk versions of ratting
---
wat spodbrain?
---
He's just proposing another option which may lead to more satisfaction. 
---
AAGH I tried to sneak through the jump gate man! Can't make it. Can't make it. Input's stuck. Outta my way son! 
---
A return to form for BBTB! great shitpost! 
---
I don't think you're in a position to make such fine-grained judgements about a studio you don't work in.
---
European, particularly german and french communities, are disgustingly racist in this game. Just yesterday I read in the french help channel something about "thera get niggerified" because V0LTA was going back to it. And the guy posts YT videos of his pseudo-elite pvping here on reddit. 
---
Skin's too bright for my taste.  But any skin for the Apoc is good in my book.
---
Of course i may have been very subjective in my writing and pidgeonholed people into two groups.
---
however the Mouth breathing F1 pusher is actually a very accurate representation of most of Sov Holding large scale alliances.
---
It is so much so, that there are doctrines that you can have 4-5 alts, and still do that. Ever wonder why most alliance doctrines are very easy ships to use?
---
Ferox, Make sure hardeners are on, shoot bad guy
---
Muninn, Make sure MWD and hardener is on, follow anchor and shoot bad guy, hopefully hit ADC on time
---
Cerb, Exact same as Muninn
---
Ishtar, follow anchor, keep drones on trigger, ADC when needed
---
Gila, Follow anchor, keep hardeners on, keep drones assisted to trigger
---
Machariel, Follow anchor, keep hardeners on, only shoot primary when told
---
Jackdaws, Follow primaries, keep on anchor
---
Why is stain considered so good for exploring?
---
Are you sure about that? I don't have a currency named after me that I force line members to use in order to get back a pittance of the money I steal from them. 
---
What is your output? Being 1% of the dps on a ferox?
---
Being able to log in and jump to a cyno with a dread to kill a super that was moving? Being 5% of the dps of that kill? The kill that would have happened even if it was just 4 dreads, since you are basically doing a structure bash with dreads on a super that was dead the moment it didnt warp off in time?
---
or was the satisfaction knowing that of the 120 guys in your fleet, you were one of the 110 that stayed alive because you were so good at broadcasting for reps. Thank god the 30 logi were able to rep against 50 enemy ships, oh man it was close.
---
I am sorry you feel that way. 
---
We specifically used CoRoT because that was the data set that we were given by the University we collaborated with.
---
Same as when we were helping with the mapping the HPA with the first iteration of Project Discovery, specific data from a partner.
---
Not sure what the future holds for Project Discovery, but perhaps there'll be other data sets used in future for different scientific projects! 
---
:D
---
In the long run, dedication and persistence wins.
---
Too many people are complacent with rorquals and carriers or too nervous to give up that lifestyle. If you actually want minimal f1 content as a ping warrior, then chances are you are in the right place in a blob. But many complaints come from those who want more, and the solution is to get the hell out of dodge and actually start doing what you want.
---
Stay on something long enough and eventually they will have to dedicate themselves to you or they will lose. If they dedicate to you, you win when they give up.
---
Plus if more small groups actually went out and held space, it wouldn't be remotely as empty - so long as they aren't blobbed into oblivion immediately afterwards.
---
Sort of. The only reason I trained to get in an enyo back in 2006(?) was because it was red. I think I only used it for missions and general dicking about, but I had a red ship with a big long penis on it so I felt good. So I agree to an extent.
---
I prefer CCP's (not at all consistently implemented) modern idea of making T2 variants different models. In the old days the thinking for T2 models was a colour change and maybe a few extra engines. Compare that to the more subtle but, for me, more pleasing differentiation between, say, and Obelisk and the basic Osprey
---
this 100 times.
---
So many people say "eve is dead, this is dumb". They are normally in a large alliance, just F1ing every day, lmao
---
Soooooo... absolutely nothing stopping you roaming in small gangs even if you're in a large alliance. 
---
Stratops are different however and as you suggest (more fun for the FCs as they play chess and we're the pieces - quite often getting the story after the engagement for opsec reasons).
---
Have you ever been in a Sov Holding large scale alliance?  Your description of it doesn't fit my experience.  Goons, for example, have "sigs" and there are all scales of PvP.  I'm sure the other big blobs are the same.
---
wally speaks from experience having left a lot of corps
---
https://evewho.com/pilot/Wallymarts
---
The modules teiricide forgot
---
Some people like that. It's a sandbox and that's okay.
---
A LOT of people don't get satisfaction out of it and want something more, but aren't able or willing to leave their blob and thus burn out or get bored and quit the game rather than their blob without knowing what they could have done instead.
---
I played the game solo for about 2 years... mostly from Jita doing market and manufacturing stuff, and it was ok, made a shitload of isk, and I suck at pvp anyways, so it worked out.  I chatted with a few regular people, and eventually one of them became a friend and kinda grew on and me and i reluctantly followed him out to nullsec, and the game became WAY better.  Id have gotten tired and quit long ago if that hadn't happened.  
---
So yes...you can do a lot solo, but i doubt you'll stay long term without eventually being somewhat social.
---
What specifically are you having trouble with in terms of bugs?
---
So you want to segregate your ships by skin colour?
---
Damn...
---
What if the goal was to encourage more pvp instead of make goons lose their sov
---
what a world
---
Honestly think outside the context of sov for a second. Not everyone in the game is only interested in taking sov from other people, and if you think you can hold 4 regions as easily as you can hold 1 - more power to ya. If you actually can, great job. 
---
Good for him he's one and we got so much of other charismatic eve pvp streamers to choose from for the moments we can't handle a brightly character.
---
Yep, i know that RP are small group, but cmon .... /u/ccp_fozzie please give use valid way to get those BPC's
---
Thank you. And thanks again for sharing your fit and your thoughts. 
---
Nothing wrong with the tried and true method of trial and error until you find something you like.
---
Can't speak for the guy personally but the mentality in the OP is solid and desperately lacking by the community at large.
---
Charismatic...
---
Whatever trez.
---
I am working towards building a nice war chest to do just this. The PVE is too easy in a large alliance, so I am taking advantage of it while I can, but am also taking out 3-4 man fleets of friends myself and getting to know other parts of New Eden/get some FC time under my belt so that we can have some fun.
---
I am hesitant to pick up and leave because my friends are still trying to make isk, train for ships, and learn the game. But we can still create chaos while being part of a larger group. At least I'd like to think so.
---
&gt; You guys only get SRP on strat fleets don't lie.
---
Correct, didn't mean to make it sound like it was absolutely everything. But hey, we're provided ratting space / moons and all that so why not pay for ships that we use privately?
---
&gt; Also everybody else has the new structures too
---
And I didn't say that no one else had them either. But the guy above said very little ISK is being paid out for SPR and infrastructure. How come we bought the blueprints and whatever else we need to get everything replaced within the timeframe CCP gave everyone? We don't tax them either so there's still a running cost which also proves the opposite.
---
FC can I go rogue? No? Ok, thank you FC.
---
Where is the proof ill add him.
---
One time warm I was exploring in test space, a blue Helios did just that. He was triggered I was taking all of his relic loot.
---
No but you're annoying as fuck
---
not describing björn. hinting at the 'competition'.
---
He literally just told you it's not about the input, but you're pounding away on how the input is so minor.
---
I agree with you generally, so don't get me wrong here. But having been on both sides formed in this thread, I know that there ARE people who enjoy their little contributions piling up with others and accomplishing something as a group. And I know there are people who can't resist yelling about how being an f1 monkey is terrible.
---
Well this is quite a circlejerk
---
It's been a while so I would have to look through a lot of log files to find evidence. And the most condemning stuff was from at least a year ago, he and his friends got a little more tame in that channel since a couple of them got banned some time ago.
---
Correction, Karmafleet is the GSF corp for redditors the way Goonwaffe is the corp for SomethingAwful Goons. There are other new player friendly corps in GSF like ASCEE and each has its own culture and expectations. There is no reason to assume you need to leave Karmafleet because it’s a ‘noob’ corp, there are plenty of Titan pilots in KF. Unlike panfam’s class system GSF is an equal opportunities alliance where you can join fleets and SIG’s regardless of your ticker, so it really doesn’t matter if you are KF, ASCEE, Amok, your corp is just your social group with content being GSF wide. And you shouldn’t join KF expecting to graduate into Goonwaffe because it’s not a PVP talentocracy but a social group for SA goons. Goonswarm was originally an alliance founded on groups from other forums, and has always been a social organised group. ‘Pubbies’ who came to Eve direct expect that corps are based on talent or whatever like PL whereas goons is about like minded people playing together so our corp tickers are nothing more than our social clubs. 
---
This is a good post.
---
I'd be careful of encouraging dunning kruger though. Most people are quite bad at this game, but its quite possible to learn as long as you're willing to lose a lot in the process.
---
Couldn't even win then
---
Thank you for the advice, Do you have any advice on any fleet comps on the cheaper side? Like frigates and destroyers. I'd like to start of cheap so I can die constantly :) 
---
My output is helping win a major battle.
---
My output is dislodging thr enemy from their space.
---
My output is making alliance leaders quit the game and disband their alliance.
---
If 1% ferox dps accomplishes that instead of the opposite, then ill jump in a ferox.
---
I'm just talking shit lol
---
Thank you for the advice, I've led extensively in other games and I don't really get mad, but I know Eve is a whole another beast as sometimes you can have a lot to lose. However, I'm starting small in terms of ship cost so I think I should be fine. 
---
im asking what the satisfaction aspect of those actions are. Cause and effect is real.
---
The problem is when its framed as the only option.
---
Just play in the sandbox. If you like what youre doing, dont let anyone else tell you its the wrong way to play.
---
I'm sorry you feel like the community benefits from your salty posts about Gobbins not touching your pee pee anymore
---
Conversely, you can join a larger group and feel satisfaction disabling the nano burn away and shoot from 50k gameplay that all the small gang groups employ while still being able to do stuff with big ships and find friends within to roam with as well.  If anything, larger groups have more opportunities for the gameplay one desires than a small "elitepvp" corp will
---
No patch notes because they probably didn't fix anything and it would be a PR faux pas to list the things they fucked up.
---
To do this, you really dont need THAT much isk.
---
I was supplying this for a group of 20 people when i campagined against Querious. In 2 months time, all USTZ alliances there shifted their timers to EUTZ.
---
All it costs was 2 Citadels at first. About 10 Nospreys (1billion-1.3billion isk) 10 Arty Cynabals (2 billion isk) lots of tackle (another 2 billion isk). All that isk is made back from the contracts.
---
You know what i intended to be silent about people linking this.      
---
But then i think it will be even funnier if i post about it.           
---
If i say yes - this is one of my chars i can get potentially banned for [impersonating someone else](https://community.eveonline.com/support/policies/naming-policy-en/)         
---
Saying no will quite probably cut this new "i found Stain guy" posting again.            
---
So i will say - if you think it is me - i am totally fine with that, it is your words not mine :D 
---
Wow. Just how did they get that rorq in there?
---
What are you on about. Lol
---
Keep in mind how large a 'little frigate' really is.   a little Rifter is 139 meters and over a million kg.  Thats like a nuclear submarine.  
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/jwTdt](https://imgur.com/gallery/jwTdt)  \- this is a cool like gallery showing just how big eve ships really are.
---
I'm 100 percent certain it's 2 nullsec guristas and 1 nullsec br with the exact opposite in lowsec
---
Yeah, not wanting to be stuck in the same region for 3 years has a lot to do with that.
---
How was fountain? lmao
---
The only pvp it would encourage would be a brief land grab war, and hot drop ganks, and those never really felt like pvp to me, sure you killed somebody but in most cases they never have a chance to fight back or pose a threat to the droppers.
---
Sound is pretty low.

BZZT. Wrong. You've demonstrated no actual knowledge as to how a large organization such as ours works. Don't speak of them as if you did.
---
Obligatory ROTE KAPELLE is recruiting.
---
There I said it for you wally you little bitch! 
---
Im not sure what youre asking. Starbases, the thi gs citadels replaced, just had a shield. You could fly out in any direction you wanted.
---
Hope it wasn't this one [https://zkillboard.com/kill/59351505/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/59351505/)
---
My only obstacle then is the time I can currently commit to the game. I don't think any of my group would be able to pull something that size off with our level of commitment at the moment, but we will find our own brand of chaos to create. Consider me inspired.
---
I hope that you find joy and fulfillment in your day to day life. 
---
Yeah but id say 99% of large subcap fleets staged out of stations without any issues. 
---
It's bad etiquette. Wormholer btw
---
This is a quality shit post. High effort. A+
---
I approve.
---
Wally gudposting, controversial
---
I was part of Feign Disorder.
---
We owned 90% of Scalding pass, and around 70% of Wicked Creek. We fought almost daily with Triumvirate. We were able to deny them access to most of those regions because, although we were only 20 people, we were pretty good at multiboxing, and created conflicting timers for them anytime they hit our sov/structures.
---
They hit an astra, we found a fortizar coming out at the same time that was anchoring nearly 30 jumps away. we killed their fort with 20+ oracles, they missed the defense of the timer because we had alts in sabres delaying them every step of the way.
---
They tried to complete the citadel timer they started with a Nag, and fed the nad to the anti cap fit citadel.
---
I have never been a part of a 2k+ member group, since that just isnt what i want to be a part of.
---
I am familiar with "sigs". that is actually a healthy part of large scale alliances. However the moment that "sig" has hundreds of people in it, it kind of loses its point.
---
Thanks, you too. I hope there's some fresh powder your way. We got a [massive snowstorm](https://www.rte.ie/news/europe/2019/0108/1021909-snow-weather/) over the weekend.
---
&gt; PVE alts
---
Not everyone has that, and not everyone if given the possibility to have a scout / sabre / PvP alt or a PvE alt will generally go for a PvP alt. And that would assume you have those alts when moving out. Now sure most regions of space have good isk making activities so it's not the issue and it wasn't really my biggest point in my argument but it's still something you have to figure out. Getting missions is sure a whole lot more of a PITA that chain running anoms in what ever drone boat you have.
---
&gt; A small gang corp can literally exist with 4-6 real people. It wont be hard for that group to make a name for themselves very quickly. Especially if they pick on a large alliance every day and make their life hell. So what if you feed 4-6 Osprey navies? You just made that alliance competely shift gears for 2 weeks because you RF'd 1/8th of their SOV.
---
That sound a bit unrealistic, most alliances are often just begging to get those fights and form response fleet and people to fight off. You're not really shifting a whole alliance sov trolling. Some alliances will just drop a carrier on you and then a FAX if it's in danger, some will just form alpha alts, some will ask some pet alliance to deal with it, and I'm sure many randoms will enjoy an occasion to get kills. Catching straggler, bubbling gate is much more of a pain and you will get kills that way that's for sure, and you will make sure people hate you. I remember corp mates killing 60bil+ camping a gate 2j away from a big fights, just because. But also mean spy to know where they are, etc, so not that easy to set up too.
---
I'm super excited for it from all the pictures I've seen!
---
You could put people into X-7 in Pureblind (NPC STATION) it has 1 lowsec mid to get to via JF, or you can just scan holes and supply it.
---
A lot of groups near that area are very spread thin, and you can QUICKLY get PVP and tears that way.
---
it would take about 10-30 minutes of playtime to generate either killmails or salty local logs there.
---
I have done it and it was fun :D
---
please stop being toxic, i am a virgin and this will make me cry
---
Oh yes i like this
---
Wow I've been looking forward to this all year
---
Properly balanced just means that things aren’t totally overpowered, it’s like a scale. ofc you’re never going to get **perfectly balanced** but they could do something to make it better; see bosons, HAW titans, and fighter application as currently op
---
Im sorry, i guess being part of a 200 man fleet in 90% tidi is the epitome of eve gaming, i was wrong. If you are not part of the large group hitting F1 every 12-20 seconds (or 3 minutes in tidi) you are doing it wrong. lmao 1337 rorqual boosts
---
Cannot answer you 100% but I think you get special sansha loot or BPC, and it's also NPC sov space so you get staging point you can go for easily and stock your loot and only send it once to HS.
---
When was the last time you, or anyone you know, has done this at a fun level, or has employed this tactic to create a fun gameplay experience for themselves without it ultimately leading to a "we only did well because we have 5 times more guys them then, jump bridges, fax's and supers"
---
i tried to up peoples sound throughout the stream, it gets better 
---
again, what actions did you take, that if it were NOT for you, it would not have happened.
---
Were you one of the entosis ships? Were you one of the bubblers delaying a fleet response?
---
Or were you just one of the F1 pushers in a jackdaw, lmao
---
The way I found one was its fleets started reinforcing my athanor....like twice. I then figured out that if I keep a ship on the tether of it they will try to shoot the ship and not the station so it repaired itself. I then sold the location to some russians who came in and dunked it.
---
Ah Gotcha, If you run into shenanigans like that, honestly... give our diplo team a ring as soon as you can. We're a fucked up bunch that are shit at the game, but I'll be damned if some idiots want to make us look racist too.
---
Thanks
---
Fly safe
---
1) Lots of people like roaming &amp; hunting, just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's not a valid playstyle other people enjoy 
---
2) Many people roam &amp; hunt in order to get a fight with the response fleet. Now that response fleets are almost universally supers, titans, carriers, and faxes, this kind of PvP is largely dead. "hurr durr so you want me to pull my punches" is an argument against something I'm not advocating for. Empires spreading out would necessarily mean smaller or more delayed response fleets. 
---
sad thing is that its been like that for a while. Capital skins usually are around that price. 
---
Paper tanked thrashers and catalysts are super fun and super cheap. Just be prepared that every fleet will probably end up being welped
---
They also aren't available anywhere. They don't really exist.
---
They technically use 1 cpu less than the t1 mod though.
---
&gt; Typical Small gang (cheap)
---
An Inteceptor (30-50mil), DPS (Oracle [150-180mil], Brutix Navy issue with rails [180-220mil], Beam Fessor[50-70mil]), Support (Keres [50-100mil], Maulus [5-15mil], Kitsune [50-80mil], Sentinel [50-250mil])
---
&gt; If you got 10 people
---
3-4 Vexors, 2-3 Exeqs, Tackle, Keres
---
That a very small example of what you can use, but they are very effective :)

IDK how you feel about Goons but we have a lot of warm bodies and a program for teaching new FC's. I moved from Horde to Goons for numerous reasons and have been really happy with the opportunities available to me. Horde would be a good place if you don't care about politics and just want to fight but man has their leadership put them in a tough spot right now

Do it yourself you worthless krab

[https://zkillboard.com/kill/74373655/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74373655/)
---
learn something from this guy
---
Actually, your point about me not knowing how a very large alliance, specifically goons, is correct.
---
I have never been a part of goons. i have always been very anti goon.
---
You are correct, i do not understand the details of your group. Im ok with that though.
---
I do feel that sticking to a single corporation, regardless of circumstance, is not very good advice, given i am showing alternatives to people that are unhappy with where they are at the moment.
---
Im assuming you have stayed with goons and have not gone elsewhere, because that is the ideal you are championing.
---
This post is not for people that are happy where they are.
---
What’s so fun about taking a gang of kitey BS to hunt slow/afk VNIs, or camp gates and get a few people who didn’t read intel channels, and then run away as soon as someone pings for cormorants? Being 20% of dps on a VNI or hauler that jumped to a gate without using a perch? Picking off a corm that didn’t anchor right?
---
You can make any part of this game sound boring if you want to
---
It was originally 10 minute cool down with a 3 mil damage hit (max skill)
---
Know whats great about a carrier being dropped on you as you entosis something? That means they had 1 carrier that could respond.
---
Time to go next door and entosis that system.
---
Have they been able to stop your entosis that day? Cool.
---
Tomorrow its gonna be 10 entosis t1 fit slashers in 10 different systems all with different jump ranges.
---
have fun responding to 10 1adm pings at once.
---
or 5 1 adm pings, and 3 different structures.
---
Imagine this, daily.
---
It is much more fun being the one doing it, then receiving the pings and trying to scramble, every day.
---
Great, now do this in Delve and share your experiences with us
---
I dont do it in kitey BS.
---
I do it in kitey Kikimoras, or Cruisers. They align and warp quickly, and normally its the response fleet that is fun.
---
Put your PvE alts on the same account as your main. Training up a VNI alt is relatively fast. Take a break from training your main and train up a VNI ratter or a market trader, or whatever your isk making method is. If you have more than one account, have 3 toons on there that never need to be on at the same time and serve different purposes (i.e., a PvP toon, a PvE production toon (mining, ratting, etc.) and a PvE consumption toon (research, building, etc.)).
---
this
---
For now, we are top dog correct. We are where Pandemic Legion were in their prime. Thank you for pointing out the obvious. What’s your point?
---
Find a way to make their life miserable, daily. They will see what is more valuable. Their ticks are nothing compared to a good fight.
---
So uh sorry for all these questions but whys the big deal about goons and delve? Why is the profit from delve fo high?
---
you can play eve any way you want
---
You're asking a question where you refuse to accept the answer you've already been given. Just accept that you dont understand their POV and move on.
---
It’s a very safe region because it’s so compact. They have super and titan coverage for basically the entire region. 
---
Biggest alliance in the game as well with the best infrastructure and best safety means extemely high amounts of mining (endless rorqs) and ratting bounties (carrier and super ratting). 
---
It would be nice if you could make money in the space you try to take. It's a lot harder to do that since most initial systems are high traffic and anchoring citadels against a blob is rough, but sadly there aren't a lot of alternatives to handle isk making in those beach head systems.
---
If there were better ways, then you wouldn't need as many pve alts elsewhere.
---
You can kite in a Kiki or cruiser too, believe it or not. 
---
I mean, I'm in small wormhole and I still quad box in fleets. Sabre links logi dps. Just because a doctrine can be multibox'd doesn't make it bad. On a lot of other points however you're not wrong.
---
Hahaha, break the shackles by having more pve alts.
---
Hahaha yeah. This is my last past few experiences with alliances. Nobody willing to make a move unless there's a FC on. 
---
Space Boomers don't wanna be bothered unless the ping says so. 
---
Eve feels like a retirement home, and it's definitely killing me. 
---
Oof
---
the satisfaction is the success of the op and the growth/solidification of your alliance's power.  An F1 pusher may not have a complicated job, but they still share equally in the victory. No raindrop is responsible for a flood, and all that jazz.
---
Possible for.a newbro to make a lot of money exploring or something?
---
Move your alliance to Hek. I hear recruitment is booming there.
---
I was in that conversation when he said it in local... that's a new one.
---
I do it just to annoy people as I pass thru.
---
When I play Total War, sometimes I micro the troops. Sometimes I don't. Either way, a win is a win.
---
should have happened at the same time as the targeting range buff
---
same with the subcap-wide warp speed adjustment (which would be a BS buff), but I'm not holding out hope
---
your idea of chaos is tame af
---
Querns what are your other toons? You do a lot of posting for a main that hasn't had a kill in 13 months.
---
I haven't logged in for so long I don't even remember if I'm training or not. 
---
So this might just be due to a market trend but I keep hearing that Spodumain is the best(non mercoxit) ore for mining null sec. But whenever I check fuzzwork(over the past few months or so) or isk per hour gneiss always is better. Is there something I'm missing? Or is there just a fluctuation?
---
Fine, but you owe me one. (jk nice catch tyvm)
---
The action i took was showing up and helping.
---
The action i took was providing a body on the field. Whether you consider that to matter doesnt mean shit. The fleet with the most bodies usually wins. Basic military strategy.
---
and a good fight is nothing compared to a good group you actually know, like and work with on a daily basis. 
---
Fighting with 6 of your brothers over  one of your astrahus is a lot more fun than fighting over a keepstar youve never even used. The big blocks though go out of their way to smash anyone small, they're the problem. 
---
I like to poke people with my Ibis.
---
It's really amusing how pissed off some people can get when an Ibis shoots them, but the gate guns kill the Ibis before they can, only to see that same Ibis back again several minutes later.
---
Oh I'll agree with you there but most folks in this thread are defending the guy. 
---
Wish we had a way to track how many actually sell. Can put any price on something.
---
Let's be real here though, everyone in this thread talks about CCP like they are a bunch of level headed, fair-treating, sensible, rule enforcing devs....
---
WE ALL KNOW THATS NOT TRUE SO STOP PRETENDING.
---
Look at Stunt Flores, the dude got banned for a meme he didn't even make that he didn't even post to reddit, some other dude did. And CCP Fozzie is such a fucking panty waste that he got Stunt banned to make Fozzie feel better about his small penis. 
---
CCP has never treated the players equally, they've never enforced the rules equally.
---
I totally agree that would be amazing. Actually it would be amazing if CCP made it so you could select profiles with windows included.
---
“lovin dat blood”
---
idk why but that made me laugh so much
---
"part of a 2-4 hour OP with nothing more then a citadel kill to show for it."
---
Some groups aren't even that lucky after 2-4 hours ;)
---
In delve? Maybe. Delve is a pretty shitty region to go exploring though. Because of the number of people living there, exploration sites are going to be hard to come by. 
---
Salvaging behind a carrier or super is probably the best isk a new bro is going to make in delve. 
---
The title of the post is asking if you're bored or feel like your time is wasted and then offering advice to fix that.  I'd imagine the advice is not directed at people who are enjoying themselves.  
---
I love how everyone's a social justice warrior now and is pretending like CCP ever actually enforces things fairly across the board.
---
This is CCP we are talking about dude. If you hurt one of the devs feelings they will ban you. 
---
Better not make comments about one of their brain children like Fozzie Sov, you'll catch a perms ban. 
---
oh bjorn you silly silly goose 
---
Generally speaking, a lot of people enjoy feeling a part of something bigger than they are themselves. They enjoy the successes of big wins and coordination and being a part of that large scale major effort. Others, enjoy being out the outskirts of things. They feel they don't belong to the big social constructs and what to be unique and special (better) than everyone else. So as this poster points out, you can either be a part of something bigger than you are yourself (F1 pusher) or you can be a part of a smaller group that wants to be better than everyone else (secretly an emo group that is trying to be rebellious and special). Also, the outskirt group apparently still needs to outsource for writing talent.
---
but did you ask him if you can bring your drake
---
I can confirm that I've also had a site despawn while I was shooting the final structure in a 10/10 Maze when it expired.
---
Ha, fair. I'd probably do it to but I'd blow my cover.
---
You can say that you have fun and that's okay. 
---
But you can not say fun equals skill lmao. what logic is that 
---
Make small gang great again. 
---
Wormholer btw.

I didn't have to input anything to get satisfaction output from your salt output.

---
They added over 100 new icons and textures, tweaked few attributes and updated lot of graphic effect files. Probably nothing that is patchnotes worthy or it might be mentioned later.
---
If you are really curious and want to see exactly what was changed visit https://hoboleaks.space/
---
Sometimes it is actually interesting.
---
Agreed. I think a +1.0AU warp speed to all subcaps across the board would be an easy adjustment that doesnt change the dynamic of how ships interact, but make a nice QoL change for roaming.

---

---
Yeah, seemed to change over night. I looked for a change log, but couldnt find any notes on it. 
---
Yeah pretty much because intact armor plates are really expensive.
---
CCP doesn't fix things... they just keep giving you more skins and more crap to train because it becomes the meta (leshak). 
---
10/10's vary from faction to faction. which flavor are you referring to when you are talking about that first pocket?
---
so... lets take away the interceptor features from the interceptor and make em a shit frigate, for 100x the price of a normal frigate 
---
One of the main reasons why the giant null-bloc concept became such a snowball was because, obviously, null had the best ratting, so if you were in a position where you wanted to do the shiny it was one of the only choices. Not everyone bases their success on the size of their wallet, but even those of us who don't still need reliable income to go out and do the things we want to do.
---
There are a host of new options now, though, and hopefully people will start to catch on. A friend and I made 1.5B in an hour running level 3 abyss sites, just the two of us, the other day, and, fuck me, we actually had fun while we were doing it. That's more than enough for us to go throw several handfuls of ships into the meat grinder for adrenaline and laughs. No timers, no pings, no bullshit. The whole thing is 100% portable, too, so whatever part of space you feel like being in, this week, you just do it.
---
I'm legit getting ready to start recruiting into my corp to get more people in on this action and then go shoot stuff for fun with all the excess isk. Who cares if we're shit, the whole fleet is already replaced. lol I just flew a whole mess of anchorable bubbles to our current "home" system the other night for exactly this purpose.
---
The bad stuff is that you need sov to build the new gate. Too bad. If no stain could have one gate to lowsec lol
---
i don't think it even lasted a month

---
And this is how our hpic started the next great war. 
---
Thats pretty much it yea. There is RR and Tinker ratting allready, where are you ratting where 1dps and 1 logi makes more sense than 2 RR/Tinker ships?
---
Furthermore with the new killboard comming soon^^^TM they could probably recognise a logi ship doing logi stuff and find the weak link. 
---
In the end players are always gonna know how to run sites and have spreadsheets for everything to optimise strategies so it dosent matter i guess.
---
While people who break the rules should indeed be banned, it's amusing in an ironic way to see Goons et al taking the moral high ground over this. I'm sure 100% of your mining and rental/tax income is entirely above board and no broadcasting - never mind outright botting - is involved, right? And you'd definitely report possible bots in your blue space to CCP?
---
While a ship is in the site? From previous experience i thought ive "held" a site open, after the expiration. But maybe i was cutting it extremely close.

I was bored with Eve, so I uninstalled. Then I installed a game that isn't dying.
---
Problem solved.

Learn the ropes from an experienced FC for objective type fleets. feeling in the dark is going to be cumbersome on procedures like capital escalation. Roaming Fleets are the best way to jump in and get some action/experience. Just pick a target system/route using tools like zkill, dotlan, or in game map stats. Have at least one good scout/hunter, even if it is your alt. Get familiar with what your chosen comp can and can't do, and ride that razor's edge. Generally for roaming you will want at least 1 bubbler as half of what you are doing is a moving gate camp. When around staging systems, dont stay on the enemies intel too long, as they will bring something to crush your fleet. above all be patient and have fun! there is so much more too it but this can be a good start.
---
Yeah it's been an amazing winter :)
---
You appear to think you have **more** proof that mar5hy broke the TOS than any number of people who have complained about Ratters/Rorquals using input broadcasts to retrieve their drones. Let me clarify something for you. **You don't.**
---
That's my entire point. You, me....OP...pretty much everyone other than CCP doesn't have proof of SHIT and if we're okay with someone making a post like this (especially if they want to make it a daily thing), then we shouldn't complain for "proof" when someone makes a post about Bots, or other input broadcasting going on in Eve. We should just assume the worst is happening, like everyone is clearly doing here, since it's mar5hy...
---
As for your "whataboutism" involving sticking intel bots parked near gates. 
---
Okay? That's still a MASSIVE reduction in intelligence. So you see people coming in on every gate.... What about random WHs spawning? What about anyone jumping into system via cyno? What if someone enters the system but never leaves, do the intel bots just "assume" they are still there? What if they aren't and in-fact took a WH out of the system, never passing another gate in that region?
---
There would be significantly more hunting/content going on in Null Sov if they simply turned off local. To pretend otherwise is ignorance.
---
Really? Hes only been there the last 2 sites ive done. Previously he was never there, and I could waltz through the first pocket and activate gate
---
A lot of dudes go to sov for the industrial opportunities it gives you. Some don't care about small gangs or smaller fleets. They want to gather resources, build things, explore, or just run dungeons. If that means going on a CTA and defending that space then it's just a means to an end.
---
That's the beauty of the sandbox that is EVE, you can do whatever you want.
---
same, first I wanted to report it for harasment, then I thought I also should report it for being ultra bad, but the sum of the bad things actually made a "retard overflow" and I ended up upvoting this.
---
CCP please make 64 bit  reddit too !
---
The capitals need strong scan resolution nerf, specially the carriers. For the sake of subcap game
---
you forgot the h. It's "waht".
---
We actually have been moving ships to ROIR to mess with SMA, so it sounds like I am on the right track!
---
Yeah youre right though. Idk what the hell dollar store 10/10s i was running
---
But did he get both ships through the gate?
---
It hasn't been as bad as we warned it might be. That's partly because CCP did listen to some degree, and reduced the amount you can abyssal up some of the mods, particularly point and web. It's also because the other rewards from the abyss are considered to be not worth the risk by a lot of people, so the mutaplasmid market and therefore abyssal mod market is small and expensive.
---
However, some of the negative effects are seen at the high end - particularly 99% webs, but also some pretty ridiculous tanks with abyssal reppers. I would imagine that the 'elite' PVP corps run highly abyssalled fits, making it even more difficult to compete with them than it would have been otherwise. It's still a bad feature overall, just not as bad as it could have been.
---
I don't get it.
---
I do enjoy when people cant come up with an actual argument, and simply resort to pathetic insults to try and save face.
---
Good question. Since i never said fun equals skill, i wouldnt know.

---
TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON
---
Sure did
---
to learn to fc you need to accomplish 3 basic areas to research first as your **prepwork**  
---
1. Know ship bonus's and their likely role. eg, huginn will likely be a long range web. sometimes a web and a painter. this is a support vessel, not a dps role. Know this across the board so you're familiar enough to know when you see X ship hull, its likely doing XYZ.   
---
While on the surface this can seem like a large task, its not. Break it done by hull class and by faction type. EG: Amarr have 4 flavours on their ships. Laser DPS, Missile DPS, Energy warfare, Support (Tank or ewar). So knowing this, you can look and quickly slot ships into a mental bucket.   
---
\-- It's an amarr cruiser! (4 possible buckets)  
---
\-- oh its t2, so its either a recon(support), hac(dps), or a logistics(healing/support)  
---
figuring out the racial flavours makes bucketing ships quickly easy, and that can help you determine how effective an enemy fleet is and whether you can take a fight or not. (or what to be careful of once you do)  
---
2. Game mechanics. How do bubbles in nullsec work? How does aggression mechanics affect what my fleet members can do? What threat is an ECM ship to my logistics group when hes 20km away vs 150 km away? Grid mechanics, cyno mechanics, sov mechanics... etc. Again it seems daunting with the sheer size of things 'to learn about' but really once you dive into them you can see things that make sense to forget or remember as they apply to you. knowing this will allow you to avoid the super lowbar blunders that ruin a roam fast. like warping a fleet of t1 frigs and t1 destroyers into a smartbombing battleship whos bubble camping a gate.  
---
3. How to do fast research on 3 things:   
---
\- who are you fighting &gt; what do they normally fly?  
---
\- Location location location  
---
\- whos friends with who  
---
* how to find out what a group typically flies? go to zkill, search that alliance, and look for a fight that has both kills and losses. should take you less than 5 minutes to figure out a groups main doctrins
---
* location, identify bottle necks or choke points that you may accidentally trap yourself in. know escape paths, or ways you can sneak around a gatecamp to get at the juicekrabs behind, etc. Use dotlan for this, easy the best tool.
---
* google searches + zkill to figure out alliance/corp affiliations when you start out. once you do it frequently enough you just remember whos friends with who  
---
As for **the actual FCing**, i'll really say 3 things to keep it simple.  
---
* have an objective and tailor your plan to that. objective = get a fight and learn? cool. the plan is how you do that: fight on a gate, in a plex, catch a ratter, etc. plans are fluid. plans must change, because no plan survives contact with the enemy. the objective is important, figuring out how to do it with a rough idea is totally okay.
---
* keep talking, clearly and repeat orders. the worst ting is having an fc not speaking at bad times, freezing, etc. Make a decision, make the call. A bad call is better than no call.
---
* do your loops: Hows local? is it spiking? Hows our range? do i need to move the fleet closer/further? are we breaking the target? yes? keep shooting what your shooting. no? swap targets etc. are we holding? no? are we dying faster than they are or are we trading ahead and will stabilize? hows local? is it spiking? hows our range..... etc etc repeat.
---
Did not matter even if you were in site, CCP fucked hard escalations the moment they moved them to the agency. Escalation window is terribly bugged and does not show escalations based on distance, really sucks having to run dron roulettes in order to be able to get acess to mayor escalations.
---
OK get them to Airaken 
---
Of course, that is why the game is so fair... T1 Amarr ships are just as good as.... nevermind.

NSA needs a big hit or removed entirely.
---
Then, id be open to actually buffing carrier base sig res, at the cost of removing Siren/Dromi. Let them rely on SEBO's, points, painters, grappler etc like everything else. Then if they need webs, apply them themselves or have subcap support. No more of this 1 ship does it all.

consistency is the problem though. Yeah you can make 240 mil an hour. Provided:

- Empty C3 with a shitty Kspace, and

- No adverse wandering connects, and

- Lots of sites, and

- Luck for no one rolling in.

That's a tough combo to get.

are you crazy the punisher is the best frigate ever
---
Wormholes are the answer to all of the things you've mentioned in this post
---
I'm sorry for your parents.
---
I am running fleets for 1.5 years ( not veteran in eve standarts). I enjoy fleets in the size of 15-30 peeps most. One thing I have to say though : For the following reasons do some solo pvp first:
---
* You have to have knowledge of the different shiptypes in eve ( their bonuses/tank/fits).
---
* You will learn how your neighbours react + get to know the pilots you should be aware of.
---
* Bookmarks for Athanors/Perches etc.
---
* Gain knowledge about what you are capable of engaging.
---
As you have been searching for fleets that are cheap and effective:   
---
Most nullsec alliances that are noob friendly have a Caracal or Moa doctrine. You can always run those.  
---
I myself love Retributions with Deacons. Fast,agile and you can still engage bigger targets.  
---
If you look for cheap t1 frig/dessy fleets you have to have a bigger fleet(20+). At 20+ Talwars/Corms start becoming a real threat to more expensive ships. You may want to have a look at my Alliance btw :) (gotta do some advertisment) 
---
All I see is that Citadels have USB and Ethernet jacks.
---
I thought that too. But I only enjoyed the game of eve if I had a core of trusted people to play with.  SInce trust is expensive (HAHAHA), I moved on to other games. Yes some GOT ALL MY STUFF. :)
---
It's fun if there are cool people to play with and if I have time./ I have neither atm so its wasted time when I do log in.
---
Are you talking about the Deployable Advertisements? Weren't those already in the game before Pearl Abyss took over?
---
I actually have a ton of kills in a punny LOL. Solo it is really hard though. 
---
But look at Gallente... Tristan, Atron, &amp; Incursus all good. Dominix, Hype, &amp; Mega all good.
---
I would say yes. Built to take down interceptors, with a role bonus and new mod to also help ships break tackle and align warp quicker. They would need a weakness though... something that prevents them from being used in another role their not designed for. Maybe they wouldn't be as fast as a tackle ceptor, so they would have to stay closer to the target they are trying to save. Or, they only get tracking and optimal bonuses when locked on to another ship using their anti-warp mod. 
---
&gt;Am I having fun?  
---
&gt;Yes.  
---
&gt;I am, therefore, good at Eve
---
When did I say roaming and hunting? I said hot dropping doesn't feel like pvp, as in you all sit there for hours on a blackops/titan and wait for a hunter to find you a target. Roaming is and always has been a valid way to find PVP, And yes I do enjoy it, when you can find targets. But if you stretch the goons out of several regions your chances of finding targets while roaming would go down compared to how it is now not up as player concentration would decrease and while there would be more system for people to be in there would also be more empty systems.

ban him for input broadcasting

This is just a part of the full story. TRI is in the full mode of SOV grab as they are loosing their space in Insmother rapidly. For some reason, they aim to overtake Old School space in the Pure Blind.  Olds probably asked for help with TRI Fortizar, others came to whore on km...

Have you met him? Just gonna say but he toured me round Iceland in 2017 when I went (well, golden circle) and he is actually honestly incredibly nice, great fun and a good laugh. He doesn't have a "streaming" persona that I can see, that is just him. 
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEad
---
Because the sites there give intact armor plates, which are used to create a lot of t2 rigs that are in very high demand. 
---
No they don’t. I’ve always been curious what the Eve community imagines an Eve balance team would look like or do, considering how much of the game is so intertwined with itself. 
---
Test has been to the shadowy halls of SV5 and 9KOE and learned the darkest of arts from the masters of terror.  Our training is now complete.
---
So I believe something happened, gate guns shot him, he ran off in his Gnosis then got insurance payout for the Caracal :D Then went on a bit of a spree. Was rather epic! 
---
Read "grid" as "girl" and first thought was, "that will never work".

that's his point, join something smaller and make life miserable for the lazy space cows

make them do things they don't want to do and they'll find a way to do it poorly, there's your chance to shoot

It is random shit like this that make watching Bjorn so enjoyable. Just for shenanigans. That and no saltiness or REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.

I don't think the NSA should be removed, it should be reworked. The whole point is to make a carrier dangerous at 5000km away, but no one uses them that way

ok

now if only i had friends in eve so I could group up with them to cause that havok :(

engrish mate

Just ban input broadcasting altogether and remove the grey area.

They changed their focus due to too many demands on their balance skills. You wouldn't believe how hard it is to win the Icelandic Twister championship!

You seem like a decent fellow, but being a high-KDR solo/smolganger isn't everyone's cup of tea; hell, PvP per se isn't everyone's cup of tea. Welcome to EVE, motherfucker.
---
Well no surprise - blood raiders have amarr roots and the loki is a minmatar ship. WTH did you expect? ^^
---
There's certainly a fluctuation, but I would almost always go for gneiss over spod. This is because gneiss contains the greatest amount of mexallon, which is usually the bottleneck for capital ship builders.
---
Regarding mercoxit, I don't know how it is elsewhere, but where I live, belts are often left with only merc left, since Rorquals can't mine it, and it goes for significantly less on the market than other ores (citation needed)

Well ive been in a small group who took sov on its own and helped build our own space ... and damn i feel bad for people having to undergo that.
---
Being small means everybody matters. It means at the very second your home is attacked its gonna be pretty much CTA. 7 toons missing and youre gonna feed. 10 toons missing you wont even take the fight and youre good for the boot in a week. 
---
Being small means no safety, youll feed often. It also means you wont have any impact on the game at all :
---
\- since youre gonna lose most objectives if youre not close to the ennemy's size
---
\- since the losses you inflict are easily made up for
---
\- since your losses are much less easy to replace as your space (if you have one) is getting roamed daily by small gang people 
---
I can understand the feeling to pride that you get when you achieve something above your weight. But to me it doesnt compensate the feeling of pointlessness you get from your own size. Id much rather contribute small to a meaningful effort than waste hours (5hs/day before i left my old alliance) into something that will make no difference in the end. 
---
A lot of people thought the Trump campaign was a joke, and there'd be no way he'd be elected. Many people didn't vote. If those people who dismissed him, but also abhorr him now would have voted, would the outcome have been different? Maybe. They were just individuals though with one vote.
---
If one ferox was missing, would it make an impact? No. If 30 were? Yeah, probably.
---
I personally enjoy flying logi or blingy support ships. I get to do a little bit more and get sucked into the battles.

When 10 dudes is half your alliance, thats a major corp, lmao

There is no reason that it should be so difficult to actually enjoy playing eve on a small number of accounts. (1 or 2)

If it's a requirement to have 5+ accounts and *still* be stuck sitting on 2 hour f1 monkey fleets that leave you bored and frustrated then it should be all the more acceptable to leave ASAP and actually go do something you want to do.

&gt; I don't think the NSA should be removed, it should be reworked
---
good luck getting ccp to rework it in a reasonable timeframe, it took how long for them to make a half assed jam rework? Better to remove it and solve a problem immediatly while reintroducing it in a different way in the future if they wish to remake it than keep a problem for god knows how long in the hopes that they're working on said remake.

Yeah we aren’t quite there yet. We do put about 25 real people in fleets though so we are getting there.

Thank you. I feel like so many people get frustrated in EvE and come here to complain about other people not playing the way they want them to.

Fuck that I pay my subscription I'll play however I please

I’d rather play my 1 character and be where I’m at. Believe it or not but you don’t need alts to have fun.
---
"MY PLAYSTYLE IS THE ONLY VALID PLAYSTYLE AND I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERY OTHER TYPE SO IF YOU ENJOY SOME OTHER WAY OF PLAYING THE GAME YOU'RE WRONG"
---
See thats the thing though. If you want to feel actually accomplished for an achievement in a video game, do you go for the "trophy" of being 1 of 50k people that helped do a thing, or do you want the "trophy" of doing something that few have done, and doing that thing consecutively successfully.
---
Basically, Large Scale alliance fights where you are one of many is a cheap achievement, being one of the few and taking on bigger numbers is a much better achievement.
---
My immediate reply is to Fly logi.  Lots more player-decisions need to be made, and there's a lot more impact each pilot has.  There's a couple other specialized roles in fleets that can be more interesting than just DPS.   
---
That said, I do agree with your overall more people need to get out of their F1-monkey roles. 
---
I did the tutorial missions and started the sisters of eve epic arc. I didn’t realize it’s 7 chapters! Do I really have to do all of that before joining a Corp?

Good post
---
Incorrect, that is not Basic Military Strategy.
---
That theory of arms was proven ineffective during the American Revolutionary War.
---
The Americans were vastly outnumbered, and if they had adhered to the accepted form of warefare at the time, the idea of standing in lines and shooting, they would have lost every battle and skirmish.
---
Using their smaller size and higher maneuverability they were able to shoot and move, and hide behind cover.
---
The Americans, or Patroits, later went on to use the more conventional method of combat, only when they found they were fighting forces of similar size, however this was often accompanied by small sections of Guerrilla Warfare which gave rise to the early formulation of more elite fighting forces.
---
This is nothing new however, as the Apalache indians used these tactics to fend off spanish invaders in Florida in the late 1520's.
---
The idea that Warfare simply comes down to numbers is absurd and very wrong.
---
&gt; However, in EVE numbers do matter much more, since we are stuck in the confides of an alternate reality.
---
The actions of a few in this game, can largely affect the outcome of a larger entity. 
---
It actually blows my mind obvious changes like this are not included in game updates. What the actual fuck is going on at CCP? Is there some sort of massive bureaucracy to pass even the tamest of balance changes? Do they even play the game? Are they just lazy?   
---
what output? unless you're implying that anchoring and f1 necessarily create the output of satisfaction, and that isn't really true, not in an universal sense at least.
---
Yeah, salvaging is lucrative. Get on comms and say you're new and looking to salvage behind someone super ratting. You'll get directed to the right place. Once you get a decent setup and can churn some wrecks, it's about as good money as carrier ratting
---
f1 on purple broadcast instead of a red broadcast, huge gameplay difference :thumbsup:
---
the examples were used to start even just a small spark of interest.
---
To toot the horn of some friends-in-pew. The group 'Simple Farmers' is a relatively small group of pilots with high levels of autonomy and just an all-round-great social circle.  
---
For such a small group. They've wrought Havoc on the larger alliances in their area
---
new year new me
---
Why not both?
---
Why is that ominous? 
---
When we put together the first iteration that was used for assisting with mapping the HPA, we had no idea that the next iteration would be identifying transitioning objects in space, just like right now there's no information on what the next data set might be.
---
Not at all, this was directed to the ones saying they are feeling they are wasting their time, but are part of a large alliance where their time is obviously being wasted.
---
he says that is about the output, but never specifies what that output is, that is what wally is asking.
---
I don't care if I made a difference, I'm not some narcissist that needs to feel very important. I have fun sperging on comms while we shoot other people. I FC occasionally, so I enjoy the power that comes with it, but if I want to be the center of the universe I'll just go play a single player game on easy difficulty so nothing can intrude on my delusions of grandeur.
---
Yes, it is a fine line.
---
On one hand, i want to encourage people to take more direction with their actions in the game. This is a sandbox game, and to just blindly follow someone elses agenda is basically giving up hope on the imagination this game can foster.
---
On the other hand, telling everyone they are amazing and great at the game will create more Bryce and Chevis prestons in the game.
---
I think, at the end of the day, if this post encouraged even 5-10 people to re-evaluate what they are doing with their gameplay and how it actually makes them feel, that isnt a win for me. That is a win for this Game.
---
That means more content creators, more avenues for success, more experiences and stories shared.
---
This game needs to be great like it was in 2010-2013
---
I agree but it doesn't really fit under any of the allowed ones.
---
Or just all weapons
---
You don't... but you'll find you can do them pretty quickly. Remember, Eve is a long difficult game. You will need patience as you are beginning. The epic arc is nothing in the long run.
---
Again, this post isnt for people like you.
---
This post is for the people that say they dont like the game, because it is mindless, because it is repetitive, because they feel their time is wasted.
---
This is an idea to help fix their way of playing, to perhaps build on new skills in the game and have fun doing it.
---
I don't watch a ton of streams, but BjornBee is always so upbeat and entertaining. Glad to have someone like him showing folks silly fun in EVE.

---
BBTB trying for worst shitpost of the year this early? I'm impressed!
---
Some of my first PVP in this game was flying logi for a group called Appetite 4 Destruction.
---
I loved it, i learned so much flying logi, i got better at reading the grid as it was evolving, and seeing why the FC would do what he did. I learned a lot in those times.
---
Sure, it just locking up a broadcast and repping it.
---
however when you got 2 people broadcasting, what is more important to save? The Interceptor or the Vexor that has the enemy mach scrammed?
---
God bless you my friend
---
You probably have something set wrong in your probe window. Can you take a screenshot and share what you see? It's essentially impossible for someone to get rid of all of the cosmic signatures in a constellation, so if you're checking \~4 systems and you don't see sigs in \_any\_ of them then there's probably something wrong. (It's not impossible for someone to have cleared out the sigs you want ahead of you. That's pretty common. There should at least be wormholes though.)
---
Because fighters can't make that distance in a reasonable amount of time, and if you're at that range and away from subcaps you open yourself to the cyno while subcap support is at significant range.
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't like you goons. That doesn't matter though, if he broke the rules (which seems evident), then he deserves the consequences.
---
Also, grrr gons hat gons
---
Pitch a tent with me Falcon? 
---
&gt; This is true, but it's also hard to find those people to do the same thing.
---
Fuck people. Who needs people. Just create 100 alts and do everything yourself.
---
There's basically only 3 ways to get into stain.
---
1. A single JF only route from Saminer &lt;-&gt; T-NN (lowsec - Stain)
---
2. Sov 0.0 (either by gates or jumpdrive)
---
3. Wormholes
---
As a result, Stain is weird. It's also big. It is the 3rd largest region in eve, and largest 0.0 region. 132 systems, 18 constellations. Full of NPC stations. It takes 3 jumps to cross it in its entirety as well with a JDC V JF.
---
You have a lot of stubborn weirdos (I should know,  I lived there for 4+ years)  who hate each other, but who hate outsiders more. They get rich off of missions and slave implants.
---
It's basically a really really remote, hostile foreign land full of people who hate and murder each other,  but the minute you show up, they'll murder you harder.
---
This guy eves
---
Beautiful post. Independent Eve play should be more encouraged. Lots of people waste themselves away by becoming nobodies in major null alliances.
---
CTA or logout, Im 100% sure. 
---
Scanned cosmic signature escalations are different to ones gained from completing a ratting site. Ones you scan down can have slightly different mechanics. I know angel 10/10's do. 
---
2* 
---
If you leave after one recruit you'll put that corp back to 799 so the next guy is stuck in corp.
---
I think that predefining what others find as an accomplishment or fun is rather limiting. That would be like be saying that a small group would most likely never take down a fleet of titans and golly gee wouldn't that stink to know you are never going to be able to take on the big bad wolf? You are spinning a narrative that isn't just willfully obtuse, but makes a point of insinuating viewpoints other than yours are to be talked down on.
---
ccp disallows activities, not allows them
---
Reading this I was in complete agreement. Then I saw it was Wally. XD 
---
thing is the dichotomy is not "great small gang" but just straight up "small gang" or "mouth-breathing F1 pusher". I used to believe that it was an exaggeration the F1 steriotype but its very true and frightening how common in the big alliances, I met people playing for years that unironically couldn't pilot as well as a 1-2 week old newbie in a good FW corp, and that's not to say those newbies or corps were *good* but that the "F1 pusher" was really fitting of its name, and worst of all these for some reason think they're much better than they actually are.
---
You literally described my corp mail that I sent out today about being nomadic and no plans for any kind of serious home for ourselves. Great post.
---
The problem with having a team whose sole job is balance is the same problem as giving a boy a hammer. 
---
Everything’s a nail. 
---
That said, having a balance team would be nice. 
---
I definitely get that, thanks for the advice. I was just excited to have finished all the tutorials and get to some social interaction and Into the real game, those 7 chapters will prob take a while (married and work full time)
---
No, now you ask if you can bring your Drekavic.
---
Is that not the culture of debate in every situation?
---
One cannot have a belief in something, without seeing the alternatives as either better or worse.
---
My belief is that killing a ship in the game is more of an accomplishment if less people did it. How is that so "obtuse".
---
is a titan that dies to 100 Avatars and 300 Nyx as good as a titan that dies to 20 dreads that baited the Titan to drop on a roaming gang?
---
Is killing a Ferox alongside 40 other Cerbs no where near as an accomplishment as killing a Ferox with 2 other Kikimoras?
---
Have we gone so far in this game that every kill, regardless of the circumstance, is completely equal?
---
I refuse to acknowledge that, i refuse to muddy the water of pvp by saying large scale fleets are anywhere near as equal as solo roamers, or small gang entities.
---
I refuse to say that small alliance, with 20-50 people, have a less of an accomplishing appeal as a large scale 5k man alliance.
---
I will not blindly accepting this cucking rhetoric that you are standing by to defend, and i can only assume that is the like minded appeal of the organization that you are a part of.

Because there are more people in goons. GotG was in second for mining a while ago, but goons didn’t like that and deployed their sigs up there to shut them down. NC/PL is very rich, but they’re a much smaller group, and also don’t like mining nearly as much as goons. Test is currently in second, but doesn’t have enough people. 
---
It also is compact, so they can drop titans on you in any system in Delve from their staging, making their miners even safer
---
I really need a reputable reddit account for when i make good posts, lmao
---
Let me know if there is anything i can do to help facilitate this. Im all about groups like yours doing that sort of thing.
---
hit me up ingame, Wallymarts
---
Yes, but the plates alone will make up the majority of the isk you get, they go for 6.6 mil each at buy orders. 
---
Purple on reps broadcasts? WTF are you even doing?  It's the calming light-blue or nothing.   
---
Seriously though, it sounds like you've never actually flown logi (or at least flown logi well) if you think it's just F1 that you need.   
---
After having a sleep it was probably for the best, i was far to angry last night. Probably because i am too close to this personally. i shouldn't have said anything period.
---
Spod is the meat and potatoes of Rorqual mining. It's "best" in the sense that the rocks are enormous (less repositioning), and there's always plenty left after the crowd has cherrypicked the higher value ores.
---
Will do. Sounds like something we could coordinate on. Cheers chief. Likewise for yourself. If you guys get any plans then hit us up if you want more guys there. 
---
(Isaac collins in game)
---
his point was never about doctrines being bad, but the pilots being bad. If you can quad box then sure you prob aint "bad" but the guy who only single boxes what you can quad box is pretty bad, and the doctrines allow and some times even push towards it.
---
Oh. im glad these skins ariive so they can fix the game.
---
no you didnt include a space
---
I thought it was as well
---
I can appreciate that. I might go buy one fit it up and go get it killed to see for myself.
---
Can we have a planet discovery but for finding a cure to baldness
---
for... for a friend
---
But what if I really am just a shit pilot. Is there a place for me?
---
Stunt has guides, he will take a picture of your text and send it back with his DNA
---
Lavatar will melt your face off. 
---
Cosmic Signatures for probe scanning... Anoms are already active sites that you can warp to without scanning... There are options for both in your probe scanning window under filters...
---
Just buff their locking range then, it's already a hull bonus, so the NSA is irrelevant
---
Although i have no changed my opinion on this matter. i still think the main reason small gangs form is to hunt soft targets who won't fight back, which is why they get so upset at getting dropped on. 
---
After sleeping i realize it was dumb for me to have come here especially in such an angry state and said anything and i should have stayed out of this. I'm sorry.
---
No such thing in China.
---
Where can I join up! This sounds fun
---
Without big blocks kicking us out, goons never would've had such a fantastic fortress delve today. 
---
spend a few hours scanning for a highsec-highsec wormhole that takes you to the other side. with those, highsec is very small.
---
&gt;  Unlike panfam’s class system GSF is an equal opportunities alliance where you can join fleets and SIG’s regardless of your ticker
---
panfam is not an alliance dude, they're not even a coalition like the imperium is
---
His overall point certainly. His message above is that many null doctrines are so simple to fly they require no thought. This is somewhat true, but it's not always a bad thing, assuming people leverage it to do more. Which really most don't.
---
or i just take 34 gates in half the time that i need to scan me the WH.
---
on the other side, when we reduce highsec,w e can get more nullsec which is good
---
hwat?
---
i'm not a recruiter for Rote Kapele, however you are welcome to look into joining
---
By that logic, using less to win, why not advocate just being solo? Those kills count for the most. You also continue to resort to slander and insults, I'm not sure why or how it helps your recruiting drive. But hey, more power to you man. I'll go back to not judging what people find fun and telling them if it doesn't fit my narrative they are wrong and stick to applauding people for playing the game and doing what they want and if what they want coincides with me, then I'll ask them to join in and if it doesn't- that's cool too. 
---
Does it have a lowsec gate?
---
Great for washing-down those Tide-pods.
---
&gt;However the moment that "sig" has hundreds of people in it, it kind of loses its point.
---
Imagine hundreds of people you could train to do what you know how to do. Even if they don't do it as well as you, the effect is, intoxicating. 
---
I, for one, can't wait. I'm going to meme the fuck out of some peeps when the billboards come out. 
---
... both of 'em!
---
Awesome 
---
I believe true solo pvpers are very few and far between. That is an entire style of gameplay i have never even wanted to try, as i love being social and chilling in comms with some good friends and also sharing good fights with them.
---
Additionally, you can still swap clones inside the same citadel (so you can jump to the clone that's sitting in the citadel where you're docked), however you can't even jump clone to a different citadel within the same system. 
---
I understand where you're coming from op. I do. And I understand you're trying to talk to a specific strata of people. Those who could be world class small gang pilots, or content creators, or FC's, who are being smothered by the bureaucracy of nullblocks. You're not talking to the average null block member who's fine with being where they are.
---
A large number of people do find satisfaction from being the dps that brings the shiny targets, they don't care that they weren't the one who set it up. They don't mind that most of their gameplay is pve. Hell, at this point they're CCPs targeted audience. And all of that is fine. This is a sandbox. Play your way. Don't judge others for playing theirs. 
---
So for the people who resonate with ops post, listen to what he has to do. For those who don't, you keep doing you. 
---
Create a Wallymarts Chaos Sig in goons, and i will run it
---
Gneiss is more valuable because of the mineral content, but Spod is valuable too and has better Quality of Life (Gneiss rocks 200k, Spod goes up to 1m).
---
But if it's best two out of three doesn't that mean he only gets the chance to lose two times?  :thonking_emoji:
---
where did he say it's *always* a bad thing? like its not nowhere on his comment dude
---
I will however go out on a limb and say that yes it is always a bad thing to force players who want to be better to multibox instead of creating ships with higher skill caps. There's a reason people don't multibox heroic raiding(mythic? now) or arenas in wow
---
&gt; YEah they use asic miners these days 
---
&gt;sorry for all these questions
---
I'll tell you what someone told me when I said that in Horde comms during my first or second week - never apologize for asking questions, chances are there's three other people wondering the same thing and too afraid to ask anyone. Especially in this thread where participation is entirely voluntary, so you're not wasting anyone's time asking them. 
---
So many good comments itt
---
Epic. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/90519767/
---
We're on the same side of the argument I think. My point is simply that it's fine to have doctrines that are easy to multibox. It's a force multiplier especially for smaller groups.
---
And there's nothing wrong with having ships that are hard to fly and you wouldn't want to multibox. Lord knows when I'm flying a blinged out nano ship I don't want to multibox because if I make a small mistake, I'm dead.
---
However these harder doctrines don't really cater to the average player. They're not good for the huge alliances. That's a reality. Which was the point op was trying to make. If you're the kind of person who feels smothered by the way things are run in your null bloc, listen to what he has to say. Otherwise, you keep doing you.
---
Where op fails to get that across is when he implies this isn't a valid way to play the game. That everyone should strive to be better. 
---
Thank you, and i do realize there are those out there that love being part of the bigger fleets and hitting F1. If it were not for them, im pretty sure eve would have died a long time ago.
---
What’s are sigs? I keep hearing it
---
Fly a basilisk or guardian and get back to this thread. Every time FC warps 100km we have to reestablish cap chain by locking up the logi above and below our name in the capchain channel, and get locks on FC and anchor. AND keep an eye on calls for capacitor (and remember to only give capacitor from a certain cap transfer, lets say only the cap transfer that we give down the cap chain, so no one in the cap chain is left without cap when someone calls for cap). And keep an eye on calls for shield and armor (if someone needs what your remote reps can't give you launch that drone type to repair them). AND remember to recall drones every time FC wants to relocate. AND keep unlocking targets as the enemy switch targets (but not unlocking the targets the enemy suddenly switch to primary again). 
---
My main, Wallymarts, is capable of making the isk to keep losing kikimoras every day. T5 abyssals are fun.
---
Ive been trying Lvl 5's and my Scamming alt, Incursion alt and capital Alt can fit into that nicely.
---
Then again, i have been playing since 2008. i feel that most people that have played this game for a decade have atleast an alt.
---
I didn't realize you'd asked me a question, lol. 
---
And I admit freely that I'd eat all that shit. 
---
Can the next one be a data set to help EVE players find girlfriends and wives. That would make more players get off earlier then my friends like u/another_eve_account and u/cyentw would be safer while krabbing. Lord knows krabs in this game need more safety from virgins like hard knocks. 
---
The solution seems simple, remove the virgins by giving them relationships. 
---
I’ll take my accolades for all the subscribers you’ll gain thanks to the awesome krabbing now. 
---
Get yourself a T3, loki or tengu, and run DED sites you scan. They are pretty safe and make a lot of isk
---
Evictus is more meatshield, but with more fun (roams, super stealing, we do try to create our own content) rather than renter tier. We know our place in Legacy, we like the fights and being on the border. With being on the border though, there are certain rules we like to have in order to not create an environment where we just get farmed by whalers all day. That's all. 
---
Honestly, comes down to playstyle. We've seen many corps and individuals come and go, and the ones that stick it out are the ones we want with us. Our group has grown leaps and bounds since leaving provibloc, and I love that we have all playstyles, all timezones, languages (english, french, german, deutch, Afrikaans, everything). Its a game, and you just need to find a group that suits your groove. 
---
I would play that 1000 times over
---
change ship stats
---
Can your computer run 60 toons at once and switch between them at a rate of 6 per second reliably?
---
Can we go back to Ishtar's online? It was a simpler time, where the only annoying thing capitals did to subcaps was skynet.
---
Showerthought:
---
So far, since ive played we've had these tropes:
---
Winmatar - Vaga/Hurricane online
---
Drakes Online
---
Ishtars Online
---
Frigate Menace/T3D
---
Capitals online
---
So weve progressed through BC, HACs, frigates/dessies and capitals. Does that mean the next trope will be "Battleships Online"?
---
I say its not possible, because CCP has a hate boner against battleships, but i remain optimistic.
---
Business model, selling extractors
---
It is banned for anything that impacts the game world, and chat messages are detectable by other players in the game. I doubt CCP cares enough about this once instance to do anything, and they have far more important things to deal with so spending time on Mar5hy would show they are wasting their time.
---
Go Go Go Sue love you hehe and you know what i wanna drop one too named Cacique Yuhasz Palace 
---
Also known as Secured Storage Container and Mobile Depot
---
he could be talking about npc space tho, in all honesty sov is too much of a hassle for small groups when you have wormholes or npc null. 
---
Fuck sov
---
You dont need a JF though. A carrier is good enough to move ships between lowsec and null.
---
who would've thunk that their values didn't make them different after all
---
There are games I will absolutely min/max balls deep but I recognize that many just want to relax when they play Eve (or any game for that matter). And its very relaxing to be a mouth-breathing F1 monkey. So stop suggesting that its not valid to play in a relaxing way. Not everyone wants to play this game as if they're e-sports athletes. 
---
"XL SEBO: Gives 1000% bonus to sig resolution. Can only be fitted to battleships and capitals. Can be combined with NSA, because its not fair that a battleship might lock faster than a carrier."
---
Need Hydromagnetic Physics trained to 5 to use.
---
That would be a real nice change indeed, perhaps CCP will do this as a pay to unlock feature.
---
this is not gonna end well
---
still wont be enough
---
So he wants someone to put 100+ hours into making a small group and maybe not get anything to show for it, lol. 
---
CtrlV is recruiting
---
No one is going to have sex with you regardless of what Eve achievement you accomplish, so just have FUN in this game instead, and work hard for achievements in real life to scratch that itch. 
---
Or maybe kill the sacred cow that supers and titans should be able to affect subcaps at all?
---
&gt; So stop suggesting that its not valid to play in a relaxing way
---
who is suggesting this? The title of the post is literally a question of whether you are bored or feeling you're wasting your time, if the answer is "no" why would you think the content of the post is directed at you?
---
sweet jesus the amount of defensive posting in this thread is quite alarming
---
I'm a poser. 
---
I only bought the flair because I want to nano, but I know I am garbage even for Widot.
---
Who the fuck wants sov? lololol maybe 10 years ago when it didnt suck and unbalance the game
---
Yeah well not everyone has a carrier or a dread.
---
"if not for big blocs, my big bloc wouldnt have" 
---
just shh, you're all part of the problem
---
Pandemic Horde has a reasonable AUTZ presence and most things are done in groups due to the number of conflicts in/near Geminate.  You should apply, and then pm me here once you’ve been accepted, and I’ll help you get set up. 
---
You assume gathering people willing to fly beside you, isn't an accomplishment in itself. 
---
My immediate feeling on X47 armor timer, was "gosh, look at all these other people with capitals, supers and titans, and tons of subcaps, all working together to kick the north in the nuts, what an accomplishment to bring all of us together for this goal at this time and this place with all these tools at our disposal". 
---
My avatar may only have done a small amount of damage on that battlefield, but I ain't in it for personal status or pride. My ego is not that vulnerable.

I'm 2 year into the game, I got like 35 mil SP and I would not even stop to train a VNI alt. There is so much shit I need to train up it's such a PITA.

That's why I upvoted the original post, but in the comments you seem to degrade F1 pushers and imply your way is the only way.
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/96737657
---
You think good alliances are going to take that?
---
you have boring uncles
---
Shh, let the small groups have fun. It's cute. 
---
Lvl 5 aren't a small isk investment. I'm 2 year into the game and I would not want to afford it. Good thing L4 are much more accessible.
---
Metal Scrap (1)
---
I don't think it's a good idea to try and make isk in those systems. Too dangerous, ADM not high enough. You probably have a staging in LS/NPC NS where you can run missions or something and it's probably more interesting.
---
There one in amamake guristas. Probed it
---
if you count the dartboard of balance.
---
Are there even a thousand raid guilds that still play Beta for Asseroth?
---
Got nervous at first until I saw the over 800 members thing.
---
Im good.
---
I know :p
---
If you're content with just being a number and not making any significant impact that is fine. Many people aren't satisfied with that though and there are plenty of other ways to play the game outside of the bloc environment which has become so common.
---
Special interest groups. Just smaller groups within goons to do specific tasks
---
The big isk making / industry tools are rorquals, carriers and supers. Since Goons have the largest supers capitals force in the game, they can drop on everyone who roam their space with almost impunity. Now everyone does it, not only Goons, the issue is Goons packed 30k people into almost a single region (they have part of Querious and Fountain too), and the big issues and that the region provides enough ressources and PvE sites for all those people to farm in perfect security, which isn't super fun since ganking PvE ships is a big content generator. A lot of NS systems are empty, and some so crowded and defended you get a boson titan camping your entry gate/WH withing 5 minutes and you can't do much.
---
It's a bit caricatural and it's not impossible to achieve stuff, but it's still hard.
---
Hahahahaha, no.
---
CCP is an absolute desaster in this regard, and while there are too many cases to list all their failures, this post from a CSM8 member sums it up nicely imho:
---
&gt; We're just past the five year anniversary of CCP Arrow assuring me to my face (and to the rest of CSM8), repeatedly, that despite the fact that "iteration" is a dirty word at CCP, the grey icons were just a first version and they would be iterated on.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8w3v8k/do_you_miss_the_old_days/e1tih3c/
---
Time wasting for entertainment is a perfectly valid expenditure of time. 
---
If you are not content with your emotional state when you waste time in a game then you've got other problems than "not accomplishing enough" in the game. 
---
The grey icons are still absolute ass. 
---
No worries dude. Sorry I was a dick about it.
---
Wally why are you so cool 
---
&gt; But if you stretch the goons out of several regions your chances of finding targets while roaming would go down compared to how it is now not up as player concentration
---
Right now your chances in _most_ regions of finding targets is nil because no one really lives there. Your chances of finding targets in some regions is very high; your chances of killing them and/or getting a good fight from anyone who forms to save them is very low. That's because an absurd proportion of the players on the server are concentrated in a few *constellations* in the game. Spreading them out would make it harder to find people in Delve. It would make it easier to find them in other regions, easier to kill them, and harder for the defenders to drop overwhelming force on everything that moves.

Don't even bother leaving alliance. Your F1 monkey status is not temporary as the OP suggests,
---
If you gravitated to a 'safety in numbers' style of game play then it is already established that you are shit at eve. 
---
Just unsub, Go Outside. 
---
Asic I heard
---
Please provide explanation.
---
It's /r/Eve, there's no way it can end well 
---
&gt; Back when CCP still had somewhat intelligent developers, they saw how terrible AOE doomsdays were for nullsec.
---
These were the same developers that gave us Dominion Sov.
---
LOL, they can't even get the chat and market to work correctly.
---
But don't worry, shiny new Triglavian mutaplasmids are on the way to make the module variation even more fucking confusing.
---
I don't have to be employed by the studio to see that multiple bugs are staying in the game longer than ever and high priced skins are being pumped out at a crazy rate.
---
The goal of the game is literally to waste time doing whatever the hell you want for the sake of entertainment. If that's to enter an alliance and work yourself into a leader position over 5 years then burning it all, that's equally valid as conquering all your enemies and forming the infamous blue donut where you own everything. No one can tell you what you think is entertaining. 
---
Sounds like something you've actually never done lol. Believe it or not it's incredibly easy to stop this shit.
---
I love the sound of this but worried about leaving the blob I'm in. Ill have two rorqs on grid in a few days. You make it sound easy but I wouldn't even know where to start. I guess id be considered a carebear but I enjoy the whole industry side of things, it's great. Id like to try PVP, Id like to know what I using this fit or using X ammo etc... just seems like such a daunting task. You mentioned in one of your other comments that you don't need much ISK but id feel much about giving this a try if I had a decent amount of ISK to fall back on Any recommendations for ships to fly to learn and areas to visit to put them to work?
---
My trophy is the keepstar our corp built. My trophy is, for a time, performing as ops director and helping keep the corp functioning. My trophy is the ridiculous fits that I'm famous for bringing to corp roams. The sheer level of talent and dedication some of these guys display to all sorts of activities, both in-game and otherwise.
---
I applaud you, and your gr8 b8 mate, the fish seem to be biting.

Maybe he inferred that another iteration is already on the horizon. Project discovery is pretty cool

---
However much I hope for some iteration on caps/panic/supers/proliferation, I seriously doubt that CCP will change them at all before the servers close. This is Pearl Abyss's game now, not CCP's.
---
Even if CCP could and would change caps, the huge backlash from carebears would quickly put an end to that.
---
The *Nuclear Talons of Lightning, Molecules and Imbred Lions* are coming...
---
I can dumb it down any further for you, sorry.
---
This post is dumb. Most people don't want to work for their content, else there would be more FC's. People are busy and/or lazy.
---
You are right. No one can tell you what is '**subjectivly'** entertaining to you. I never doubted that. 
---
But saying that you are **objectivly** good at the game because you have fun is plain and simple wrong. 
---
That i knew. And only run the ones given as escalations. 
---
Teiricide finished years ago.
---
Sadly, most players would rather be safe and bored instead of adventurous and happy.

i believe you meant to say cosmic signatures

Nah new skill advanced signature analysis, only affects bs and caps.

You make me miss my days in Suddenly Ninjas.

---
Point to the part of new eden where a few 90 million pontifex's is taking a risk. Oh right, highsec.
---
tldr
---
I'd agree with making highsec way smaller. Such a pointless vast space... It could be made more interesting if Ansiblexes could be built in lowsec for example. Imagine "public" jump gates closing the distance between key systems while bringing content at the same time. Even smaller entities could build and maintain them as an income source (as pilots can be made to pay for using the JG).
---
Anything that would serve as incentive to bring highseccers out of highsec, while giving options to shorten travel times, would be a good idea in my book.
---
Good post thank you
---
&gt; He's not taking a risk unless his profit margins are acceptably low! 
---
Join Faction Warfare. Honestly FW is some of the smallest gang fights I’ve ever been in. Whether being outnumbered or being the big bully on the bloc, the times I spent in FW were the funnest time I’ve had in Eve.

Ok, but only HKASS

A few interceptors would be enough to stop you. And with jump bridges that give no fatigue even easier. They can be in you in 1 minute anywhere in the region.

I'm ass mad now. (I don't blame you. I realized it was too long but if I wanted to give any actually useful information at all, turning my post into a tweet style post just felt stupid)

wow a rev and a rag pilot jesus thats what 180b right there... one day ill be rich also.. but until then i hope u get ganked nerd

At 130 mil I still got shit I want to train. I even injected some things last week with the event. 
---
there have several instances were people streamed themselves input broadcasting. was reported with video proof. nothing was ever done. the only instance i am aware of somebody getting banned for input broadcasting over twitch was when the streamer kept calling out to ccp to ban him.
---
Then they aren't ready to start their own nullsec group.
---
I think the idea is to raise the admin by ratting. But I doubt it'll work. To many people will bother you. 
---
siren and dromi are the true cancer of the carrier meta

No one upvotes stickies. It's also not a good post. But it was definitely brigaded (screenshots from multiple sources among other things).
---
My definition of panfam is probably out of date. I was referring to the original Horde when it didn’t have vanguard and blessed et al. There was basically Horde as the starter corp, Waffles as the serious PvP corp that booshed into Sniggerdly if you weren’t a mong. The connection is still there but it’s horde -&gt; blessed  -&gt; vanguard or total mayhem as waffles replacement then snigg if you git gud. If you are trying to convince people that Gobbins &amp; PL aren’t an alliance in all but formality you might want to check how many fights they take together. The point I was making is that PL have always maintained a distinction based on PVP skills - beginner - go to Horde, intermediate go to Waffles / replaced with Total Mayhem, then Sniggerdly when you HTFU and can cope with Hedliners Turborage. GSF on the other hand is basically flat - Goonwaffe is just Goonwaffe if you are a day 1 noob or a 10 year bittervet, so unlike Horde/TM/Snigg there is no requirement to ever leave the ‘waffe. 
---
Yeah it's going to be a pain and the alliance will want to get their space back. Troll entosis might be a good idea for content but not really to take space.
---
DELETE TIS
---
KR's tie to the pilot not the ship. If you have a kill right activated on you, simply undock a shuttle (or other cheap ship) in a populated place like jita 4-4. once the ship goes pop warp off and dock up until the limited engagement timer and the suspect timer are both gone. you can verify the KR is gone by checking your character sheet, also the killmail (in game) will say "on behalf of" and the character who owned the KR at the top of the killmail. Note: i dont believe noob ships clear kill rights, can be quite that cheap xD
---
You don't need career to PvP in NS you know.
---
But then its probably like a 2% bonus to effectiveness of the XLSEBO. Whereas hyrdomagnetic Physics does nothing and wont be aligned with anyones learning attributes. Means more injectors.
---
Fucking dope corp name. They didn't let us keep the Islamic State in New Eden. Really wish they would let us Larp as space terrorists.

RIP CCP's HTFU stance.

Down on the bottom I saw a little download arrow next to the version number. That downloaded a hotfix and made things work again.

I can say with firsthand knowledge that you're very wrong about the former point, mate. He does it on the reg. He's not concerned with being stopped. He's concerned with succeeding in being a pain in the ass.
---
tl;dr: gatecamp in nados
---
Yeah I’m pretty sure something broke on the backend that made the launcher guys reeeee 
---
I sometimes wonder if these things are simply forgotten due to the old blood leaving, or if CCP truly doesn't care. Despite this being something easy to overlook it's a pretty big deal.

Honestly?  They just need to remove the stupid ass timer.  Any fictional problem that it solves is trumped by the issues with stability.
---
Yeah, without the timer, you could overtank a cheaper ship and do it.  Who the fuck cares?  The isk/hour in these things is already not that impressive when you're optimizing them, who cares if Johnny Whackit uses a cheaper ship and does a site in 45 minutes?
---
Sigs/squads come into existence ***after*** a group of players have been forming on a regular basis for some time. Not before. 
---
I use EVE-O which has you click on the next tiled window to open it full screen. Very effective and totally EULA compliant. 
---
They’re fine for dreads imo cus dreads are killable and immobile... 99% of the time in home territory titans are basically invincible which makes them overpowered (just look at how much goons yolo drop titans onto even frigate gangs for proof). 
---
And I think the easy answer to your missile question is to buff cap missile application and velocity slightly (but keep range the same). Tbh Levi is arguably the best titan right now except for their missile system, I think UALX and that NC ks in pureblind shows how superior shield supers are so too big a buff to cap missiles could be a problem.
---
I would like to see CCP tweak fighter application to make them able to fight cruisers but not as strong as they are now, and to be able to easily hit battleships as they currently do. (And not be able to track frigs with anything but SS fighters)
---
I’d also like to see them make bosons not affect subcaps or remove them entirely. Multiple titans Bosoning enemy fax is a legitimate and higher skilled strategy in a super fight but I don’t think they should be so strong against subcaps... could make the damage scale based on sig like bombs do 🤔
---
Finally just remove HAW from titans but keep it for dreads... imo titans and supers shouldn’t be able to easily kill small/medium ships and that is where the current balance problem lies regarding them, to add to this issue in many areas of the game supers/titans in a standing fleet are almost invincible which defo makes it op that they can engage these small ships without virtually any worry. Further buffs to the cyno jammer could alleviate this some what (e.g. give it resists, even quicker anchor time, and make it cheaper so more people have them in their ships)
---
And to anyone saying BuT iTs A tItAn ItS mEaNt To Be OvErPoWeReD; no it’s not and you’re fucking retarded 
---
This is all just my opinion though, maybe my solutions aren’t the best but I think that if you don’t see that certain aspects of the game are broken balance wise you’re blind (obv not directed at you op just in general)
---
This isn’t a debate on the most efficient ratting methods idk why you’re trying so hard to derail this
---
Looks balanced to me
---
/r/Eve/comments/advyza/what_is_the_point_of_these/
---
I know my dude. Dominion Meme Redux edition.
---
Hate to break it to you, but they're static enough that they're already boring after you run a dozen of them.
---
Lol
---
Try to send it to their community team
---
I hope that they get some other opinions on this other than these guys, it kinda feels like if you said "wardeced targets shouldn't be allowed to dock" they would be like "hell yes do that."
---
It ALWAYS stretches, if you're brave enough.
---
I don't know why you backed down, the ISD comments on your thread were grasping at straws, they had nothing
---
the way i describe that is it can definitely be pay to play, but not pay to win. want to pay to play on a more "elite" level, great! you are certainly not going to automatically win as a result.
---
don't use windowed more... you're so entitled lol
---
The GM I spoke with wasn't willing to quantify what is and wasn't offensive enough to not be used, wouldn't even let us do shit like I.Sys, I-SYStems etc.
---
we are, indeed, recruiting. Come be a WH tHuG :3
---
boooo
---
Last time I tried creating chaos with friends our little party would get dropped on by about 50 dreads and carriers in short order, honestly kind of lame.  
---
Eventually the game wasn't about the kills, it was about getting alliance X or Y to respond with caps and scrambling like a bunch of cockroaches when they did, which to be fair, was entertaining in its own right.
---
This is the best. So glad CCP Games are good sports.
---
yea, elite pvp .... gate camping.   aka sitting around for hours doing jack shit.  only takes 3 players and 6 accounts.  
---
YEah they use asic miners these days 
---
I hope you called them ass mad.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
I'm not saying it as an indictment on the player, I mainly said it because offensive entosising high ADM systems with frigates are so brokenly useless right now it's basically completely ineffective. I've done it myself many times, using Tristans rather than slashers, but the fact that even to ref the ihub you need to stay on it for 50 minutes makes it pretty much impossible unless you're doing it to renter/renter tier people.
---
OF COURSE IT LOCKS FASTER THAN A BATTLE SHIP IT'S CAPITAL SHIP FOR SHOOTING DRONES RETARD
---
You do know, that when you get concordet you wont get insurance money right
---
"The absence of risk is only a problem when krabs do it" ~ blazes 100+++++b in 2 months in lowsec. 
---
everyone is risk averse, that's why we don't fly what we can't afford to replace
---
The only time I have ever heard the phrase “Tiericide” is on reddit. 
---
I'd be interested to know what the screenshots are of. I am the literal subject of the post, and I didn't come across anything that would have been considered brigading.
---
LMFAO
---
I can defend that krabbing should be designed inherently risky by CCP, yet try to krab in the least risky way myself. Think more than 5 seconds if you think it's contradictory.
---
I’m afraid to even ask for this because I’m going to get made fun of. 
---
It's all me me me with you huh? 😋
---
You can run L5s with a single T1 fit carrier.
---
I literally wrote in the title, a shit tier plays guide to nomadic pvp life style. How did you spin this in your head that I was promoting some elite pvp lifestyle?
---
I'm not looking for good fights, we are looking to be cancer and a nuisance, figuratively clubbing someone over the head and as you get ready to hit back with heavy with a hay maker, then we move to the next target.
---
Not elite. Just a fun time and social bonding. Our Kb is pretty high on kills for being less than two months old.

"disruptor"
---
Faction police pay out 
---
Shit you got here before me. Well done
---
Thank
---
Well, yes, an Obelisk and an Osprey do look quite different.
---
Its for logistics. Makes moving ships really easy and for a small group it has plenty of room.
---
Have they made any attempts to pressure the test market him hub? Is that effectively impossible sure to high sec + keepstar?
---
I should have. I didn't have the balls to be mean to a Gm, If he was ingame maybe then though.
---
Why Does Every Word Start With An Upper Case Letter?
---
he's flying two ships at once, which normally would be multiboxing
---
but here he's just swapping between two ships to get them to the gate
---
god this is cringe af
---
Sure, but your details and reasoning behind them are not factual, so it is inherently a flawed argument. Can't blame you for not wanting to do what we do, but don't expect to not be challenged when you're spewing factually incorrect statements.
---
Sooo.... what happened? I don't quite understand.
---
I am a politician, after all. 
---
Really depends, I run level 5 missions using less than 1bil of ships. I average about 15-20 mins per mission, which isn't as good as carrier blitzing with multiple pullers, but only needs one toon to pull missions and basically no startup capital. 300-400k LP/hr consistently is still great ISK.
---
B-but I like TEST... Even if I only play Skill Queue Online.
---
I'm talking L5 abyssal :p
---
Talking L5 abyssal sites sorry for the misunderstanding
---
Id need to find and make friends first :(
---
They're are a handful of corps like ours. Some focus on good fights, others focus on big fights, some focus on being cancer, others about thunderdome 1v1 etc. I can think of 3 other corps like ours. Just look up nomadic on evejobs
---
Leshak isn't *the* meta, it's the meta for high sec.
---
I’m in pandemic horde, plenty of vacancies haha
---
Hey, try to attend a csm meeting, or something?
---
I would pick the praxis/rokh/machariel over a tempest for SB. Larger model means more SB coverage. Also a T2 hyper rigged machariel can warp after shuttles/rookie ships/non inty frigs and beat them to the other side allowing more kills. :D
---
Pretty sure Battleships online was like, the pre-T3 cruiser days
---
gatecamping is worse than pve
---
That ended a while ago. 
---
Step 1: sell everything
---
Step 2: transfer all that isk to an other character
---
Step 3: be rich forever
---
Or maybe someone was really smart and figured out if caps were op they’d sell a bunch of plex/skill injectors. 
---
Use a DST, and if you don't have a DST you're not ready to start your own group.
---
What's wrong with the new icons?
---
Lumio is that you?
---
I suspect they will, there is just a higher priority right now.
---
Tiericide means they go through and change all the dogma attributes on hundreds of items.
---
Currently CCP is reworking their dogma system back-end to something more robust, if you are a couch-surfing-dataminer, you might have already noticed some of the odd change-overs, they usually come in waves of some item category being added a new null variable and then that variable is set.  There was one such wave this week.
---
I suspect this backend change is multi-part, needing pos code removal to be effective, and potentially being a requirement for x64 codebase.  The old dogma system used its own modifier expressions which might be old school byte code that is not suitable for expanded data sets (this is my suspicion anyways).
---
Needless to say, if you were going to change the way everything was stored, would you do a huge balance pass before or after you did a data schema change?
---
I know I would do it after.
---
&gt; end 2014 is 4 yo but whatever.
---
From the message I linked, I'll bold it for you as it seems you didn't bother to read it:
---
&gt; As of **15th of March 2013** we have been policing **input automation** based on a two-strike policy
---
Hell most F1 fleet pilots don't even know how to deal with jumping into a single ship. So many retarded ferox mongos have jumped into me with a t1 frigate and just sat there and died. The level of handholding in F1 fleets simply doesn't allow for learning the mechanics. 
---
I save the Mach for when I have more friends around me. I've lost a lot of them and learned the hard way that insurance payout is super needed.
---
Tempest and the Megathron are the only battleships that can align under 5 seconds with 4 inertial, which is the closest to the Mach align time. Among them only the tempest has 8 slots, the Roth is 9 ls align, same with the Abba don't, the praxis is 7 slots and has no insurance.
---
With ascendancy implants and a warp speed 615 implant im able to go 6.4 a.u warp speed on my tempest with tech 1 rigs.
---
The Mach hits over 9 and is the only option to be able to catch captor quick enough every single time.
---
That was my logic in picking the tempest. It lacks a lot of tank, the Rokh is way better in that regard but I just run triple prop mod always and defensive grappler. All my losses have always been due to a faction point or many points on one ship. Grappler with a Web makes that go away.
---
They can already lock at 5000km without the NSA, it then takes it to almost 7000km
---
Didn’t he say create chaos though, not camp this one gate for all of eternity?
---
Yes, feed the animal. Give it what it wants. Watch it grow. 
---
The first three I linked are acceptable uses of input broadcasting according to the CCP post about it.
---
You don't get ass mad mails in game from PVE sites.
---
Thanks Ill have a look. Pretty much been in big blobs since I started, I'm very hesitant about leaving. Got to drop my carebear mind and leave my comfort zone, I do have an alt training up so I might start by getting that into a pvp group first
---
How dare you advocate for Chaos? By the Emperor, DIE YOU HERETIC
---
~Some random Inquisitor
---
Thanks for all the replies, I guess those people trying to catch me aren't trying hard enough.
---
Luckily I haven't run into any bubbles but I'm glad I got an idea of how I can be killed now!
---
This is as EVE as it gets.
---
Chaos is good.
---
Some others here are saying a warp scram and disrupter, would two scrams be better or is it just situation dependant?
---
Get a tattoo of a bee
---
Get a poster, your body is a temple.

I'm at all of them.

Eve dad jokes come around often enough, it wouldn't be the emptiest subreddit around.
---
Having a lot of experience as both an artist and a canvas...
---
Give your artist relevant source material (ie, in game visuals from Eve/pics of ships you like/anything else you would like to see incorporated) and give him the freedom to design your tattoo from there.
---
That really is the best way to end up with the best possible piece.
---
They always did this.
---
Just trying to keep 2019 classy, we're only a week in yet dude.
---
you'd be surprised
---
So instead of a google search and printscreen work from trailers, you came here instead to tell everyone that you plan to do a tattoo, nice.
---
cool post what does it mean
---
Wtf, why would exit strategy and simple farmers need to krab.. 
---
He knows I was a space battle involving eve online ships. He is asking for as many combat pics I can find I like. You are right though I'm trying to let him take the lead on the design
---
You're talking about designers here, not developers. Developers just write code to do what the designers wanted - insult the designers if you have a problem that isn't a bug.
---
Eve Online in a nutshell since 2016.
---
i read that as pay to undock and i wasnt even surprised
---
when the news poster is in test, oh its just a test smugpost
---
This.  You don't want a reminder of the flaming piece of shit Eve becomes at its end on your body forever. 
---
I see your flare congrats on being gay 
---
You know what would be cool?  To answer player concerns on how much of a shit pile your game is becoming instead of lurking reddit. 
---
My body already has 13 decent size tattoos based around important things in my life or that I've accomplished. So this temple is already covered in banksy's. Any help is appreciated or just click away. No big deal
---
5-10? 1 guy with too much isk can be enough. Know from experience...
---
Can run T5s in a gila that's half the price of a carrier.
---

I don't know, but I'll change that too, it does seem a little weird. :)
---
if he was input broadcastyer he';d be banned
---
They probably fired everyone working on tiericide after that game failed.  Which game?  Pick one, there's like 5 to choose from.
---
you sound retarded. did you graduate from a public school?
---
Given that the NSA is (supposedly) intended to make carriers relevant from several thousand kilometers away.... should it instead function as a "remote activation warp drive" that allows fighters to actually *warp* a semi-fixed distance (possibly using scripts to adjust the distance?)?
---
And then axe the scanres bonus, because if you're sitting that far out having battleship-equivalent lock times isn't a huge deal.
---
Well if it comes I'll be ready, with Gallente Battleship 5 and \~7 days away from also having Min/Precursor battleship 5.
---
Plus T5 guns for all of them. Including [*TORPEDO*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggRNBtgKEfU) [*BEATS*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaNXlbCblgg) (side note battleship weapon trains are *so cancer painful CCP why*).
---
Yea. I would just tell him to Google Image search "Eve Online". There's plenty of material to work from.
---
Death to goon bots, i will not stand for such heresy in god forbid my own alliance
---
that's fair... considering they are against object based warfare cause it limits targets, they are against corps paying for peace unless its 10x more than a war costs cause they value their game play at least that much more than the defenders... Honestly i made the decision at the start to limit how much i had to say on the topic cause they did enough damage to themselves. (some exceptions as there are some styles of war that i feel are very positive and need to stay around, small groups with issues between them) 
---
remove the comma
---
That sounds almost as exciting as rorq mining.
---
Alt-tab f1, repeat
---
Or he could be fleet warping around his barges when neut comes in system
---
Could you elaborate on some of the data mined changes? What kind of variables are they tinkering with? 
---
I like this post. Often the Krabbichi ask me why I bother to hunt them, why I'm not making mad ticks, why I don't join Faceless Blob #n.
---
Simple, I'm here to have fun. I enjoy creating chaos. I enjoy being the fly buzzing around your space.
---
Last night myself and two friends shut down major ratting pockets in 3 different regions, forcing the residents to either fight or not rat. We got some fun little fights out of it. In one evening, myself and two other guys killed 5b and had a blast doing it.
---
A c2/nss wh is a great way to roam but you don't even need that. Thera still exists. Random wh's exist. Roaming from high to null and roaming low exists. 
---
Yeah there will be times you die, yeah you will get blobbed, yeah sometimes you will need to run, sometimes it seems like cyno after cyno but the fights are worth it.
---
Start small and set your expectations low. Just aim to have fun while you do it.
---
Go and be that crazy commando rampaging through *their* space.
---
Yes, tell me more how the 15 hour tidi fights where your modules don't work and you can't use missiles or any other non instant application type weapons because the game may not register them, is truly peak levels of fun. 
---
I'd listen to the Asher Hour Podcast.  He is The Imperiums 23rd best FC and has about 30 episodes on FCing.  There is some info on ship types and fleet comps that has changed but most of it is really good information on FCing.  They are definitely interesting and there is no doubt he knows what he is talking about.  
---
We just killed another one and you're still on about like you mean something.
---
Sponsored by CCP!
---
Well, they would be separate but still equal.
---
yea but you gank a ship you get concorded no?
---
If there is another I would like to join. I couldn't make it this time due to prior engagements.

[Whores in Space](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99001955/) - I lead during their peak, with umad as the muscle, then left soon after. First wardeccing alliance to destroy 1 Trillion in a month. Freight Club helped a lot! (was displayed at fanfest)       
---
-Forced RvB to remove their pod loss penalty. During a war dec, if a member lost a pod, they had to pay 500 mill. (this is where I think station camping got super popular. Members got +100 kills a day and still today the scrubs we did this dec with are in wardec alliance trying to recreate our masterpiece)

Our corp only plays in low sec, but only high security systems concorde you for attacking ships
---
I love this. I love you, op. I definitely read a kindred mind out of this post. We might meet in space, but on opposite ends of the barrels. And whatever will be the result out of our dance, will not involve hate.
---
If I weren't so deep within my current organisation I would probably try my luck as an 'agent of chaos'. There is no definite "becoming" an agent of chaos. You just tip the balance as often as you can. Cause as much disruption and chaos as possible.

---
If only they used all of that money to learn how to play the game...
---
that's one way to make something sound far more complicated than it is. You can argue logi is more complicated than dps and sure I don't disagree but all you described was basic drone usage, cap chain and being able to lock people after warp , dude wtf. 
---
&gt; (if someone needs what your remote reps can't give you launch that drone type to repair them)
---
this makes no sense, the basilisk and the guardian both only have enough space on the drone bay to fit one flight of light rep drones so you'd have the opposite drone to the damage type you are repping which doesn't really help you hold any better on shield fleets. If you need to launch them you also don't have them on space in the first place and now there is the whole travel time before they start repping, you deploy your drones before nerds need reps not after.
