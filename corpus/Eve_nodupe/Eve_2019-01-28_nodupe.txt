Any more than one ping and tapi lose their minds apparently.  Wouldn't want to lose ping rights

“We did push skillu and scourge to the point where they feel they need to drop titans and such to win.”

---
The FC who fleet warped the entire fleet to their death..
---
So what ship type will we all empty from the markets on Monday lol
---
The classic viking funeral
---
Hudders died for your right to pingspam. RIP

A GSF member, passed away and a memorial was held in 1DQ on the KS.

"This is not a sisi training op or serious business op so it would be great if you showed up but if you think dropping a palatine for no reason on a server that doesn't matter to 99% of eve players just to fuck with like 3 dudes who sisi warrior feel free to not show up this just sounded like fun.  This fleet brought to you by #sapposquad
---
SRP: No
---
#### SENT BY Sapporo Jones to OP General @ 2019-01-21 22:01:21 EVE Time ####
---
What happend?
---
retribution pixel art and im sold 
---
He said "Reddit" not "Dreddit"
---
if they were bots why didn't they warp when he entered local like all the rest do?
---
How can test ever recover from this!
---
Even better.  
---
Was a insanely fun ship while it lasted GF provi
---
Imagine getting pings for a sisi save op lol
---
Oh wow how will we ever recover from this huge lost?! Oh no, wat do?
---
The obvious implication is he was using it for more. Like coordinating bomber runs and just forgot to shut it off while typing in local. Are you just trying to ignore reality to feel better about defending a broadcaster?
---
test derangement syndrome is spending 2 months building a palatine keepstar on sisi
---
and in his case he was screen capped using it a way defined as illegal.
---
Wait I didn't beg, they've asked me three times for it so I said yes then they voted it down.  
---
Damn... Sorry to hear about your loss.
---
May he rest in peace
---
Oh shit, sorry to hear. Well, he's probably in Valhalla for real now, blasting away with all the other EVE players up there.
---
imagine spending 2 months building a palatine keepstar on sisi hoping for upvotes
---
Bombers paid by market warrior.
---
some of the choices you make in this video make my brain explode
---
Sorry to hear about your loss, man
---
Exploration 
---
Yes
---
Remember when tapi made a huge deal about the provi dreadbomb feed from PL?
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers 
---
&gt; He proved himself that he is abusing isboxer this way or another 
---
First of all, that has nothing to do with whether the situation deserved an article. It was most likely an on-demand article or best case bad journalism (the author didn't try to speak to him). Goons metagamed the article to get him banned.
---
Secondly, he doesn't abuse anything you dingus. He uses it legitimately and forgot it on. There is literally nothing a career afk camper can use broadcasting for except logging in.
---
Lastly, by spreading the Goon narrative, you're actually helping an alliance which doesn't do anything for input broadcasters in their own region. You know, the type of abusers you despise. Mar5hy is as innocent as princess white compared to how some people in Delve are using isboxer.
---
Buy mats for 100 isk in seeded station, put in to build, play tq eve for 3 weeks, come back and anchor then a week later get a fight.  
---
You make it sound like there was some grind for it, industry is pretty push button.  
---
I didn't say they were bots, I said it looks like bots. There are many reasons a bot might not warp off. Like the computer lagged. The inter lagged. Pushing his/her computer too far or not having the program(s) configured properly. An individual may have multiple computers set up with one broadcasting to the others and the broadcasting PC shut down, crashed, or the owner forgot to turn the bot on. Many, many reasons. 
---
Thanks for breaking the news gently, he’s kind of slow and just needed someone to give it to him straight but gentle. 
---
1. I can't believe they have have matte black skins for all covops ships yet.
---
2. I want cloak effect MTX!

https://ore.cerlestes.de/ore

90% sure it was you
---
NPC SoE space, was one of the minmatar model stations, maybe [this one](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/X-7OMU_IV_-_Moon_3_-_Sisters_of_EVE_Academy) but I don't remember what is and isn't a kickout, honestly
---
I was pretty new at the time, few years back
---
Code wont accept miners
---
In fact, all three can spawn in highsec (limited, standard, superior)
---
Im sure it was me, I just dont remember things lol
---
oh. Well you got immediately blapped by like 300 dudes off the undock, but it was very noble cause you checked first before you had anyone else undock
---
I think you are vastly overestimating the amount that anyone cares about code.
---
Remember when Titans just instantly killed everything on grid? Pepperidge Farm remembers. 
---
Remember when Hedliner decided to defend an Athanor with little significance for a dread bomb feed under TEST's supercap umbrella? Pepperidge Farm remembers.
---
They are professional role players, so pro that mining is not part of their agenda. 
---
People need to stop dropping structures in M-OEE8, it's cursed, did we not see the structure earlier in the week that got shrekt by all of eve except legacy? 
---
That’s not how you meme, dumb ~~retard~~ Valkorsia 
---
Who?
---
while it is kinda broken to delete a full fleet within warp, you could argue the same about smartbombs right? anyway, not arguing for or against bosons since i dont really have ''experience'' with them.
---
ive only encountered bosons on gates/drags which you can easily avoid by pinging/good scouting.
---
thus my question if it is hard to dodge a boson. the ones that just jump in right next to you.
---
Should have dropped it in some random ass wormhole.
---
&gt;If the hi sec miners joined CODE and just continued afk mining
---
then they would be in violation of the code and will have their equipment confiscated, no one is above the code not even alliance members
---
need a huge number of battleships and positioning them is a lot harder
---
at least you killed the raven.
---
Input broadcaster. No one can stand that amount of button pressing aids on the regular basis. 
---
Have you purchased your posting permit?
---
Surely someone could just lie, ask to become an agent, and then go off mining?
---
I probably supressed the memory then
---
Perhaps I am, but if so then I must give them credit for their prominence, CODE were among the first groups I heard about when I created my EVE account. The Goonswarm was the first, followed by some of the other big alliances, Eve University, and then CODE.
---
PL lost the entire region. Least you only lost one ship. gf
---
If you reacted on time you've probably escaped, or at least could had a chance to warp off the grid
---
But hey, I've never roamed in a super, what I know
---
T5 abyssals and C13 wormholes.
---
FC what do.
---
Is there a list of what the killmarks actually mean ?
---
These guys: http://www.minerbumping.com
---
I believe there was an anti ganking outfit created to specifically counter CODE, but Im unable to find any trace of them.
---
Their posts are hilarious. I admire the way they keep in character all the time.
---
welcome to the club.
---
Yeah but it's boring as fuck when compared with dread bomb killing/being killed.
---
No actually. Been mining quite a lot in hi sec. But I'm only Alpha, and mine only in a venture, so perhaps I am not worth their time and effort
---
while I think Bosons and generaly caps are broken in this game. This was actualy just weeding out the weak. If you were prealigned and aproached the gate when the fleet landed in the bubble. you had plenty of time to jump the gate. I made it through the gate in a ferox without even overheating the prop mod. But people are more concerned what stupid joke they can make next, then actualy using their brains on this fleets, so they die and hopefully learn. The opposition is called Skill U for a reason.
---
Maybe
---
"With 15 times their numbers and 2.5 times the fleet number, we did push skillu and scourge to the point where they feel they need to drop titans to mop up the fleet after we are already fleeing the system against their subcaps."
---
and yet you pinged :thonking: 
---
Certainly, the point being to infiltrate them with so many afk miners who merely pay lip service, that they become corrupted from within. Imagine if they have to start policing their own corp members, it would undermine their moral high ground and spread distrust, perhaps even dissent.
---
ah, so that's it. wasn't aware you had split, but hadn't heard anything about you in a good long while
---
The problem with code is that, no matter if you have permit or not, they will still gank you. So they are just lowly scammer liars really. Nothing honorable about them. They are also insignificant. Fun little jerking circle sucking off each other after a successsful scam, and they even brag about it. 
---
This looks like it is from the anime RWBY, animated by Rooster Teeth.
---
fine if you're not a bad
---
i killed/was responsible for killing tens of billions of isk worth of illegal mining equipment, i was never in the CODE alliance. The CODE is an idea, not a corporation. even if you did collapse the CODE corporation the message of the Savior of Highsec would live on
---
Then surely it would be a good thing to do, to infiltrate them and corrupt them from the inside, with a view to destroying their reason for existing? Would you be interested in helping me carry out such a scheme? It would certainly take some time and would require a great many people to pull off though.
---
That has no bearing on how much effort went in to building it, just that I pinged for it.  I stand by that decision, fun was had.  
---
So nothing then
---
One kill : one killmark.
---
There is a big killmark for every 10 kills, and bigger one for every 100 kills.
---
Proper send-off, o7
---
/r/iskreddit
---
&gt; But people are more concerned what stupid joke they can make next, then actualy using their brains on this fleets
---
^  Proves he was actually in the fleet.  Lots of awesome comedy and tricky people...  Not much attention paid.
---
I DONT KNOW WHAT'S WORSE HELP ME 
---
&gt; input broadcasting is allowed
---
since when? the ula of CCP says otherwise 
---
Did you ever collect money for mining permits? 
---
Concord lost a ship :P
---
blame local chat :ccpls:
---
goon pets have good propaganda for the peasants you say?
---
b-but wormhole man bad!!
---
I'm not sure I follow. Are CODE considered to be "pets" of the Goonswarm? I really dont know.
---
why do renters put up a fight?
---
Because it is cheap to do and more fun than just watching your stuff die.
---
Prop mod decycling intensifies
---
Nice piloting 
---
fair enough, never been in one of their groups so I find it hard to understand their mentality.
---
Yeah, I mean I wouldn't normally expect it, but it made for a fun time.
---
Rorq alts in ASCEE

Ello, i'm a new player in EVE Online and i'm considering empires at the moment. I agree with the Gallente Federation's politics, however i'm also swayed to choose Minmatar due to the fact that I would like to make my avatar black (brown). I was wondering that if i chose Gallente, would I be able to make my avatar black, or would I need to choose Minmtar to do that?
---
[Different style, but I made these a while back.](https://i.imgur.com/uE5rFKk.png)
---
Isn't that the same group that had a director defect to Test who subsequently flipped their palentine to Test on a previous mirror?
---
Good bot
---
That is because it was a good fight! 5 hours of struggle. Maybe best fight I have had in years. You guys brought it! We did too!
---
damn, medium sized Drekavac fleets look sexy and fun as fuck. Good video
---
I'd love to have 720mm ACs.
---
A handful of caps are surprisingly effective, this video is some of the better successes over the last couple of weeks but there's been a good few feeds too if you browse through the killboard. Been pushing this comp pretty hard to find its limits.
---
Nice song. 👍
---
I copy BPCs and average around 40b a month right now, but expecting to reach 50b/month by the end of the year
---
because people are dumb, stupid, stubborn, or misinformed.
---
James315 former long time Goons "Historian" becoming the "Saviour of Highsec" to harass all the miners not shooting rocks in delve? Yeah, kinda hard to see the connection there. /s
---
that just means we're winning the autism battle
---
I was just reading some of them.  Damn, that looks like a lot of fun.
---
ez
---
Mostly ratting. I can grind out a wad of ISK in a few days. Semi-AFK. Very low risk.
---
That'll be implemented sometime around when they solve the bot problem.
---
Its hard to FC when you have tonal emphasis and also sound like a 15 year old faggot. I know. It cost me an AT6 win.
---
Does this count as a morale post?
---
shhh don't ruin the narrative
---
The obvious implication is that you have no proof he used it for something else.
---
Praise James!
---
LOL which one are you talking about?
---
Well, speak of the devil. When are you guys going to pay me my 10 BILLION ISK ""ANTI INTERNAL CORRUPTION" permit? Hmmm? Tick tock tick tock...
---
Oh. Thank you for explaining that. 
---
The first one. 
---
Certainly as a new player there is a lot of catching up on Eve history.

You have the edge of a bowling ball. Please stop posting and/or violently euthanize yourself.

No u, Legacy outnumbers Panfam. See you when you don't need to batphone the biggest coalition in the game because you can't win even when you have the bigger blob already omegalul

Very fitting music choice to go with vid👍
---
Is that before or after local gets fixed?
---
Because its fun, its practise, and who cares about 30 caracals? 
---
" The obvious implication is that you have no proof he used it for something else. " The best part is that I don't need proof he used it for anything else because what he did do is still a ban worthy offense according to the rules.
---
&gt;I want cloak effect MTX!

Oh wow, hey Halenark. I was with you in 7th Sanctum and The Graduates. how are things faring?

I used to be a boring , unfulfilled high school chem teacher.  But then I discovered a secret - how to make millions by growing crystals at home!  Now I just buy all my ISK from CCP
---
Where did all those skillu players come from?
---
It was crazy I got like 51 kills in tackle.  We were brawling and tackling them to prevent them warping off 
---
the feed happened before the fc get in, we know that caracals wont tank many dreks even with logi, so extra dps help, but we rushed and didnt have enough to break the guardian ready, and ran out to go again. 
---
based on what exact evidence?

Seems to be a Reddid app problem.

This video is beautiful. This memorial fleet was very intense and I never experienced anything like that in a gaming community. Unique.
---
Rest In Peace! Will never forget that!
---
This honestly sounds like a wonderful way to get an 8-part blog post written about how you joined CODE and then got ganked anyway.
---
This isn't a good amount of money, and it wasn't even me that got it. We were fucking with a Wingspan thrasher or something in a wormhole, trying to bait and just being silly.  The thrasher(?) was sitting on a high sec hole, presumably to either try to blow us up or blow up someone coming through.
---
Well, while we were sitting there being dumb at each other, a random shuttle comes out of nowhere and lands on the hole.  Of course it gets vaporized instantly -- dropped a 200m pile of loot.  It was hilarious because of how random it was; it was a really strange pile of loot too, nothing to do with wormholes.
---
o7
---
Yikes
---
Honest question: will you guys come for the armour time? coz i need to arrange my work schedule :)
---
Very well made, o7 fly safe
---
If the ship itself is an Omega-only ship, you won't be allowed to undock in it. If the mods on the ship require Omega skills, those mods will be off-lined as an Alpha.
---
In addition to the HAC example /u/vaminos brought up, if you train Cynosural Field Generation as an Omega, for example, once you drop to Alpha your cyno mod will be off-lined.
---
Its like true, untainted, absolute superiority, and it feels fucking amazing. Not that I could actually describe it to you in any way you could possibly understand.
---
Beautifully made, the cyno is now lit, fly safe. o7

That gave me goosebumps

Yeah and this waffle did a couple big things incorrectly that probably would have saved him. Not that you'd know.

lol what are you on about, its even lower than PH's rate when they were in forge
---
Tbh I've never flown a super before. What could mr.waffle have done differently?
---
Good job Marc, you be you brother.....A+ for effort!!!
---
New player so this might be bad what about covert cyno inhibs similar to how we have covert cynos that blops ships could use
---
How much?
---
Awesome video! Hazing those HICs.
---
Even though i knew the outcome i was rooting for you to warp off :)
---
Exceptionally well done.

You are with the stars brother.

probably none, coz they wont show :(

I member. Member when Titans and supers needed subcap support to protect them from tackle?
---
I guess one could simply check your killboard, if they see no incentive to pvp then you wont even be accepted.
---
Its rather easy to differentiate scrubs from quality personnel.
---
Member when the fastest locking ship wasn’t a carrier 🤪😂😂🤪🤪🤣
---
Wasn't a battle, it memorial service to a member that passed away, only thing being destroyed was an Aeon and Archon for the send-off, the rest were self-destructs and sacrificial ships; no structure bashing occurred. 
---
If you do something noteworthy or are simply persistent enough, chances are you get recognized.
---
Absolutely.
---
Nice recruiting campaign 
---
Every 10 i think it is missions you run you get a special mission offering probably at another nearby station. That mission will give you a much more substantial standings boost.
---
Do you see how many kills I've gotten with it? Are you actually serious. I mean you're not. But ok, he could have aligned AWAY from the cyno to a point rather than into it. Not turned off his AB, Overheated his AB from the start AND taken his drugs right away to get maximum speed. And then immediately fragged the only hictor pointing him. At that point he would have gotten out. 
---
Rest in peace o7

Member when boosters were uncatchable?

You mean easily catchable because I lost 5 ogls a week ask avery about it

No

Kills Flycatcher instead of the cyno ship first.

Infiltrate them and corrupt them then, this would probably take years to pull off though; and the more people that know the less chance it has of actually working too.

You are on the wrong track, don't sweat it though.

In a time where we have a broken game on life support and the end game power creep has ruined what most of us loved, these types of things make me want to still be a part of it. Take a step back and realize we’re only about 2-3k nerds who love the same thing and it’s dying quickly. It hurts my heart to know the friendships I’ve made are fleeting. This was nice, ice forward Diana.

Delay. See my post below for a good chunk of the changelog.
---
If there is anything this game has taught me, and anything you should take away from something like this, it's that friendships made in EVE are *not* fleeting. I've seen firsthand the incredible bonds that have come out of sharing our time in this virtual world. The fact that we have thousand-man cyno and firework vigils for absent friends is proof of that.
---
Call this game of ours as dead as you like, but our connections to those we fly with are anything but.
---
You do realize that even before he kills the onyx, the 1 devoter is already pointing him and the other is ready to take the point so the other can get reps? I get that you don't login very often but I figured you'd still know how to read an overview.  
---
The minimal amount of velocity/distance gained by managing the AB correctly is moot at that point because the devoters literally cyno in within 10km. If you figure that he aligns perfectly, runs the AB perfectly, and has drugs pre popped, he MIGHT gain an extra 5km which is still well within scripted point range. 
---
Put in the same situation, I'd bet  against even you, the ***best*** super capital FC in the game.
---
I joined the game as they were removing it so I do not, but I remember the stories
---
Two main reasons probably:
---
1) TAPI needs space. If you've ever been down to their main krabbing pockets, its sort of ridiculous how many people are crammed into each system. Probably taking a leaf out of the Goon's playbook as they just started clearing out the QFC for more space.  
---
2) CCP announced that botter's ISK in corps and alliances are going to be taken away in the future. Either TEST doesnt want to run the risk or KWG decided that its not worth the risk, so KWG is going away.
---
Gotcha, so run 16 missions, run special missions. Rinse and repeat. This was what I was looking for. Thank you!
---
I work irl then buy plex then I sell plex ln the Mkt for iskies!
---
I saw this earlier on the agency tab and was wondering what it was about. Thank you, I'll definitely go run this.
---
You added an extra r to Tom. Although Torm was injected out of your incessant pinging to train Apostle alts, so I guess you got something right today!
---
Not be predictable. Use a ship scanner on tackle ship. Go in the opposite direction of the cyno. Since he gets a bonus to AB speed that should be left on since a scram wouldn’t shut it off. 
---
Shit happens, we are human so we all make mistakes in the moment. More so when one is complacent and unsuspecting of something. 
---
They only ceded West Feyth so far. They still have the eastern at this moment. Get your facts straight. Not saying the rest can't follow, but it didn't YET.
---
Also always look at the structures tab on dotlan. It's the most reliable.
---
Basically how I feel when I play Eve 
---
Fuck botters, hope those buggers end up having to relocate across the galaxy.
---
Hmm. Yes. Good point. And I will still be scrub for ages. Damn.
---
There are a lot of people with a solid role and goal. Just to name another one: Signal Cartel
---
Or another one: Wingspan
---
or...
---
You just didn't find them all yet.
---
I would like to setup visitation rights with capri
---
imagine being an upwell palatine keepstar citadel on sisi who is being shot at pinged about and posthumously smugposted about on reddit in zero tidi
---
Essentially, yes.
---
KWG will however continue to rent Omist to my understanding, and has left Feythabolis peacefully.
---
I also have a question about code: For weeks now they are killing old Control Towers in th Domain region. Hundreds of towers have been killed already!
---
While I highly endorse this kind of janitor cleanup work, I still don't know why.
---
Code is an organization solely dedicated to making grown-ass men break down in tears over internet pixel spaceships. They're really disturbingly effective, too. 
---
Good job going out there and trying to create content at least! People like you keeping eve alive and fun.  Sorry about your loss so soon though. 
---
presumably lots of alts
---
&gt;Comes in tank fit instead of gank to kill a Raven in a Revenant.
---
You're retarded and don't know how gank supers work in tyool 2019
---
&gt;No smartbombs or neuts.
---
He's retarded
---
i grind my isk on real word jobs, bought plex then sell it 
---
I'd rather they relocate right the fuck out of the game.
---
maybe 1% of the game population cares about 1% of the players who die
---
also i find it unlikely that ccp will break the fourth wall in-game
---
total killmarks?
---
" 1 week ago CCP announced that they were looking into taking the botting ISK from corps/ alliances. " So this whole time they were fighting botters they were letting alliance and corps that received the isk keep it? 
---
What? It's much more than 5km, I've never claimed to be the best. I know what I'm doing, and I've gotten out of worse situations than that. You don't see my supers dead, just rorq. Stop pretending like you know what you're remotely talking about while being a bitter fuck wit.
---
Mostly PI and occasional shiny loot from PVP. I don't fly expensive ships so it funds my PVP well.
---
This is a beautiful video, well done.
---
Ripped my souls out. Well done kind sir.
---
Fly with the angels Diana Sarain.
---
Do you mind linking me where CCP said that? I'd be interested to read it :)
---
[whoa i can do that too](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/288619772323561483/539285683064406026/unknown.png)
---
Oh no moving vnis will be a real hassle I'm sure that area won't be replaced by different botting renters.
---
And you didn't want to keep your Fade sov anyway right?
---
Likewise, but alas that's not going to happen unless CCP figures out how to prevent banned players from making new characters.
---
Many long running game have a memorial. 
---
STO
---
WOW
---
minecraft
---
Just to name a few
---
Yeah, unlike rest of the Legacy, not showing up on parties at all. 
---
Alternatively, nothing happens until CCP bans them, in which they just make a new account and drag their new bot back down to feyth. Which would you prefer? 
---
Because the only people you ask us to punch in the face are people we really like to punch in the face.
---
Excellent turnout at the Memorial Fleet; proud to be part of this send off and Ashade know your family is in our prayers.   
---
RIP Diana Sarain. Fly Safe. 
---
a few times, it wasnt too common, had to revoke one once cause the guy was afk mining the day after buying a permit
---
Lets all just ignore winter co. deploying in what looks like a classic distraction attack on Legacy space just as all this highsec stuff kicks off, because its only uncool when legacy calls another coalition for assistance...
---
I've checked em both out, guess I'm still too paranoid about someone taking my login info. :/
---
They definitely look like they'd make things a bit easier, but I'll probably continue to go the au-natural route for awhile longer. 
---
A numerical advantage in subcaps doesn't count for much when both sides are fielding equal super and titan fleets of a few hundred each. And as we have seen several times now piles of dreads and carriers mean nothing when the supercap thrown down starts.
---
The cyno is now lit, fly safe Diana. o7
---
10% i stole. 20% i was given. 20% ratting/mining and other. 50% having idiots hand it to me. 
---
🤔 When did we die? Nobody tells me nothin
---
Speech 100
---
wow looks fun haha
---
&gt; TAPI needs space.
---
People would probably go forth and make use of new space - if it happened to be under the existing umbrella, but Feyth is most definitely not.
---
Also, you can stuff *alot* of people into the same region in 2019 Eve before it even gets annoying and Esoteria is still far from that point.
---
you can;t stop them from making new characters but you can take all the botted isk away and stop letting them hide it in corp and alliance wallets. If you take all the money there is no more injecting new alts without being a wallet warrior and they are botting in the first place to avoid spending real money. I;m not sure why after all these years of telling plays they follow the money and take it it just now occurs to them to take it from corp and alliance wallets as well.
---
LMAO. Sailor Jita 4-4! Sailor 1-DQ Keepstar! Sailor Wreck of Steve!
---
I STG - I am either a time traveler,  or I read this exact same post a few months ago.  
---
     
---
It is a great idea.  Have an updoot
---
Its simply terrible how some people can not resist the urge to afk, even after they have bought a permit. Let us hope the bot aspirant was able to correct his miscreant ways.
---
&gt; Lets all just ignore winter co. deploying in what looks like a classic distraction attack on Legacy space
---
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
---
u realize those two coalitions have a NAP for the next 2 months right 
---
The ban is fleeting but the shame is forever
---
Someone should have made the encounter an edited video with heavy metal music:
---
climbing action: ships warp to titan
---
near climax: titan cycles doomsday, ships try to escape the AOE.
---
climax: heavy metal guy screams, 80killmails generated.
---
I would confess I was very tempted to join them. 
---
Not saying. Go away. :(
---
:reeee: Stealing my paste for karma! 
---
I will definitely check that out.
---
Cheers!
---
Simultaneously
---
I did not know you, but I honor your family and comrade's memory of you.
---
are you retarded or smth?
---
winter coalition haven't moved from O3 in months
---
EVE does have a memorial, it was created by the players by dropping cans with the name inside of it. It's at Molea II, Moon 1 if you'd like to pay it a visit
---
Probably I am being way over ambitious in this plan. 
---
:sun:
---
Beastie Boys - Sabotage from star trek ahhh i remember.
---
Sounds worth it! At this point getting ganked by CODE would be an honour.
---
But I like sweaty tracks!
---
Okay, I will google those guys and see what they do.
---
True\~! When I know what I'm doing I'm going to host a fleet that I'll make and provide to anyone willing to die with me. It's my end-game fun plan. :D
---
It's about the same amount of inconvenience how long do you realistically think it will be before these bots are set up else where? 
---
it's not enough of a inconvenience to care. It's not a huge investment to start their vni army again to be spinning in hubs in all their systems.
---
Yeah... The circle at the top would never let you in lol
---
the semi-yearly reminder that as a renter you have to pay your rent. 
---
SHOCKED I TELL YOU!
---
Space Oddity?
---
We need answers.
---
&gt;smug posting over SISI
---
Which I've never disputed. Ever. But that doesn't make it illegal to own as a program, no matter many Bees try and tell me otherwise. 
---
I need a link! 
---
cringe
---
So I have seen, yes.  I have nothing but the greatest respect and admiration for CODE. Which is why I want to utterly destroy them.
---
I must admit, I waited too long looking at that picture expecting it to be a gif.
---
It's ok when we disband he'll go home.
---
Please let this be a normal stratop...
---
i hope you never run for CSM. 
---
Please note that the story missions usually incur the wrath of other empires, so watch you standings and don't shoot too many empire faction rats unless you want to be KOS (kill on sight) in their respective empire space.
---
I move stuff. Sometimes mine, sometimes somebody else's - I'm pretty good at not dying while doing it, so I get paid more often than not.
---
The judge and not being able to slap people around?
---
Its a bit frustrating. I want to get an angle on this game which isn't just doing the usual "make ISK blow up ships" stuff. But the big boys really do seem to have sewn everything up. 
---
i hope you get a job as a fox news host, you've already got the retard news going for you
---
It would be nice to have a monument near the eve gate, a tomb of the unknown capsuleer type thing.
---
Having an absolute blast! The best is when I'm up late on weekends kinda drunk and some group of aussies brings me along for some hijinks! :D
---
On one hand though I find that quite admirable, punching above their weight in the propaganda wars, even though their actual impact may be considered by some to be insignificant.
---
I used paint to do that on a screenshot as a noob because I was sending it to ppl who didn't play EVE. Sadly it stuck to poor Heidi. 
---
Rest in peace brother. o7
---
&gt; No one can stand that amount of button pressing aids on the regular basis.
---
Translation: I'm too lazy to try and don't have the drive that some of these other guys do, ergo nobody else can box 30-odd miners. 
---
Which? 
---
&gt; Pilots into instead of away from bubble.
---
the biggest mistake he made
---
&gt; Kills Flycatcher instead of the cyno ship first.
---
&gt; Comes in tank fit instead of gank to kill a Raven in a Revenant.
---
&gt; No smartbombs or neuts.
---
lol m8 please
---
PI and exploration.
---
Certainly you Goons have achieved that. But AFAIK you guys have got so big you are virtually unassailable, along with some of the other big block alliances. You might as well say "we won" and ask for a server reset now.  Also. I want a coffee mug with the Goonswarm icon. You guys should be selling these irl. Seriously.
---
funnily enough, if that other revenant was with you there would have been a reasonable chance you would have lived.  props for using it though, no shame in losing it. everyone who uses their toys in hostile areas gets got at some point.
---
imagine posting a comment about someone getting upvotes for posting a comment containing a variation of a reddit post title involving the imagine something x meme and then imagine imagining posting about imagine meme comments imagined in an imagine meme thread
---
BEES CAN NO WRONG, WE'VE NEVER CHEATED, BUT MARSHY, HE DEFINITELY USES HIS BROADCASTER FOR COMBAT, WE DONT HAVE PROOF BUT HE DEFINITELY DID AND WE'VE NEVER HAD BOTS, NOPE NEVER
---
Don't bother with him. Mar5hy is guilty of everything but Imperium has never tolerated botters - definitely the only truth that matters. 
---

KWG decided to stop paying protection money?
---
it doesn't matter if they combat broadcast or not even chat broadcasting is against the rules....
---
look at all those bots
---
Them moving assets to a position capable of attacking legacy sov was covered by multiple news entities this week I guess you missed that.
---
No one said its illegal to own IS boxer, that's what you decided the conversation was about, what he been stated several times is that the way marshy used it was against he rules.
---
You should join a corp... One that lives outside of highsec and will teach you the game.
---
For example: Pandemic Horde Inc or Eve University
---
TIL that we are a dead alliance.
---
You say that, yet the amount that CODE posts on reddit is much lower than many, many other groups in this game.
---
&gt; How could this be?
---
they hadn't called their Goon masters perhaps?
---
Wo ist die Bahnhof?
---
ty friend!
---
I mean how can you even lose when you have three full fleets against one...  that's some next level shit
---
From Cornak Firefist (a test diplo or something) to someone in Legacy discord: " Basically we're converting the rental ownership system, which is part of how Brave ended up with that Feyth constellation, due to payment failure. So Feyth will remain renter space, apart from the Brave constellation of course, just differently organized."
---
I mean, I'm with Doom. The guy was doing a pretty good job but he really was 5km away from escaping. I probably wouldn't do better but perfect piloting may have helped him escape in this scenario.
---
My advice is play the game more and interact with people in game. You too can be a big boi™ with enough time and patience. Just focus on having *big dick energy* and you'll do just fine
---
We do : fatbeeswag.com
---
What does Bosoned mean 
---
Yeah that's why I said "almost". I still tend to log in on my incursion alt I'm working on just to plan skills and dump isk into it for more injectors.
---
your effective standing is the highest of agent / corp / faction.
---
so if you do missions for a lvl 1 agent you will also be raising standing with his corp. eventually you will be able to do missions for lvl 2 agents for the same corp.
---
after doing 16 lvl 1 missions for the same faction (not necessarily the same agent or corp) you will get a lvl 1 storyline agent mission. once you complete this you will gain some faction standing. this is also true of doing 16 lvl 2, lvl 3 and lvl 4  missions for the same faction.
---
a quick way to gain faction standings, and so open up lots of agents quickly, is to grind the Career Agent missions which are designed for new players. there are three school systems for each faction with five agents in each. while most new players only do one set of agents it is possible to do a set in each location.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Career_Agents#Career_Agents_Locations
---
the best option is to pick an aligned pair Gallente/Minmatar or Amaar/Caldari and do all six locations. you will end up with faction standings high enough to open up lvl 4 agents for half the corps in highsec.
---
dude so far it's been just TEST alone. but perhaps you will see come of Legacy tomorrow ...
---
Who are you again?
---
A week ago CCP announced that they were looking into taking the botting ISK from corps. Maybe KWG got smacked with a negative 100 billion ISK balance.
---
*Turon Gorp wants to know your location*
---
They would be completely useless for a small grid version.
---
Quality shitpost.
---
I actually know the guy who runs these miners.  Definately not a bot, just someone who uses Eve-O.  I'm guessing he was likely afk briefly, or just became complacent with cloaky campers.  
---
You just used the word drive in the context of multi boxing 30 exhumers. Let that sink in. 
---
The poem, I don't know how it's the go to thing to say in EVE for a player that has passed. Like the sentiment is nice and all ... but it's honestly just not that good.
---
Explo in catch, plus the occasional Sansha 6/10
---
I guarantee you, the people *selling* mtu's will win.
---
second life
---
He must be trolling lol
---
I have to wonder why your leadership insists on reaching at "content" the way they do. To think you were going to "invade" Horde space without supers was laughable...especially when you knew what the United North's super fleet was. 
---
WTS dreads M-O keepstar
---
You just used your laziness and lack of imagination to label anyone with more brain cells than you as a EULA violator. Let that sink in. 
---
The difference between Eve onion and Imperium news media is that INN pretends not to be Eve onion
---
&gt;I know what I'm doing, and I've gotten out of worse situations than that. You don't see my supers dead, just rorq. Stop pretending like you know what you're remotely talking about while being a bitter fuck wit.
---
No in reality it's just that you and your worthless alliance are just a bunch of risk averse shittlers who care more about your precious green killboards than playing a game.
---
But keep raging on reddit and pretending like you and your shit tier alliance with its fancy killboard are something that people give a shit about anymore. 
---
Hopefully they take it from any corp or alliance that the botting alliance transferred it to.  Ehem, like TEST.  Sieze the ill gotten gains from anyone who harbors or profits from botters.  
---
Still about 120-150 million/hr (about).  It has slipped down a bit over the recent past with the decreasing ore prices.  If you are running 4-5 Rorquals it still adds up.  
---
The ROE does take longer though, if you are injecting the pilots and drones are still costly to buy in.  
---
The best part of Rorquals though is that it scales  very well with multi boxing and that it is generally a relaxing low action per min activity (unlike super ratting). 
---
I keep on doing the math about moving to supers or Titan ratting, but the effort and risk don’t make me want to switch yet.  No way I could do either of those activities for 4-5hrs like I can with the Rorquals. 
---
The thing I like about it, is that if you are doing it to build titans or supers to fly, it almost does not matter how much ore is going for.  Just stock pile it till you have enough for the build.  
---
Way too much horseshit to micromanage.
---
The pic you posted is now my desktop background. Sexy as hell.

Trusting cheaters, wewlad. Eve really is the greatest example of folks who delude themselves.

All caps dead on blue side, 5 on red, Revenant pilot needed a change of pants and we got DD'd by Tactical Supremacy. Overall good fight, 10/10 would drop again. Thanks to all parties involved.

Is there any chance in your eve carrier not to suck dooms dick 24/7 ?
---
Wormholes
---
understandable
---
:pepehands:
---
Revenant Pilot here, thank you for making me the content for once, was alot of fun in the end. Had a good laugh, and thank you for the fun
---
It lived because it was a shield super.
---
Idk about the stance of the rest of the imperium, but the initiative activly throws out any botters in their space with enough proof.
---
am i the only one who pissed his pants reading the subtitles?
---
lmao nice vid
---
With the Legacy?
---
You realize a decent laptop that can run modern games on medium/high (forget about EVE) with 100fps+ in 1920x1080 cost the same or less than entry level macbooks?

yeh, flash, rocket salvo all around, grid all of sudden full of wrecks, great times 😂

not that powers was around for cyno dds anyway

multiboxing 30 clients manually to optimize space money generation is gaining favour as a new intelligence benchmark over IQ tests

He was on vacation, not even temp banned.
---
I do like this idea.
---
Eve's been running for such a long time that in only a couple years, people who were born after the game's release will be legal adults. Unfortunately, some of those people who have been playing this game will have passed on, and this would be a touching way of remembering them. 
---
Not everyone can have the same sendoff as our goon friend had today, but at something like this would be well deserved. 
---
Eyes forward capsuleer.
---
And it all started with Caracals and BNI's vs Gilas.... Good fight guys, we had a blast.

---
I'm not sure though if you're joking, out of the loop or just miserably stupid.
---
That's beautiful! Well done!
---
I actually can't figure out how to even see downvotes. xD I am shielded from the jaded?
---
I boson havens, and VNIs
---
To clarify, I don't run VNIs, I occasionally boson them.
---
lol what? I drop my toys in just as dangerous situations. Don't project onto me what your opinions of my alliance are. If you think this pilot performed optimally that's pretty hilarious.
---
Ehhh too convenient of a coincidence.
---
Sure its possible, but what's more likely?
---
When you hear hooves, do you think "Horses" or "Zebras"?
---
I never knew you, I will never know you.  Fly safe, I will light a cyno for you to always find your way.  Fly safe.

He isn't wrong though

Some could say you've....
---
BALANCED THE SCALES!
---
&gt; They have ~~supercap~~ dominance.  
---
FTFY based on the BR 
---
Here's a better analogy; if someone tells you it's a horse, do you then contradict it and say, that even though you haven't seen it, it must be a zebra and everyone telling you who has actually seen the horse is wrong?
---
There was never any actual evidence of Mar5hy being banned in any form, and the Bombers Bar FCs were all aware that he was taking a vacation, given that he's been working his ass off for months.
---
CODE. is strange bunch. They are probably at this point best trolls in eve. Their actions are exploiting the stupidity of people. If someone is retarded enough to expect any kind of so called honor in EVE whatsoever, probably deserves to die. For a - as some people tend to say - insignificant group or "who cares" group, they have prety good publicity nevertheless. They are decent in what they do, but its probably the only thing they can do, which is a shame in a way.
---
afaik they are about 35 real people
---
i like the choice of music!

Still waiting

Super/titan BPC's are slightly pricy. If he can make about 6 titan BPC's a month. He should be making around the 40bil i think.
---
Dropping near tikle when aussies have a public holiday.. not even surprised about the titans
---
new rule: you get bosoned every time you run away
---
How do you approximate how many blueprints you can sell per month though? There's no way to check improved BPC volume. 
---
Dont post about who you plan to infiltrate on a public forum.

Im still quite new to Capitals in general and never got dropped before, from your perspective how scary is an anticapital torpedo salvo?  
---
Can a dread tank that?
---
Thanks for the Video! Makes me want to train into one too tbh!  
---
1. You can keep track of contracts.
---
2. Goons build far more than 6 titans a month, sell to their internal market and you can unload a lot there as well.
---
Sound advice. I am stocking up on supplies of BIG DICK ENERGY™ right now. Those Goonies wont know whats hit them. Other than a big dick.
---
now comes the question. will panfam fight the armor timer or is a blueball, again?
---
We awox bots whenever we find them.
---
There will be unsanctioned bots un every major alliance. Horde, TEST, Goons. Even Tri and Init.
---
Operated*
---
&gt; fatbeeswag.com
---
Totally awesome.
---
Why not?
---
If the tips I receive put me in a position to effectively infiltrate in the next month to 1 year, I win. 
---
If I am unsuccessful, I have certainly given their recruiters something to discuss with their applicants for the next year...also a win.
---
You will never take me alive! 
---
oh...
---
This is really great!
---
This post leads me to believe you won't succeed. You're like the bad guy in films that talks to much. Like you should have just posted how do I join code. I fully believe you will be the one getting scammed by them.
---
Eve would be a better place if more people had this attitude. Spod bless. 
---
I cant help but notice that you guys have yet to pay me the 10 billion ISK I demanded. I will consider this as merely an oversight on CODE's part. For now.
---
My own opinion of CODE is that the entire (IMO quite pretentious) 'philosophy' aspect of it is all an enormous farce to do one (or both) of two things:
---
\- make suicide ganking sound like a noble pursuit instead of it being an attempt to take advantage of dumb hauler pilots while praying to the loot fairy (or to just farm tears/mine salt)
---
\- extract salt/tears from the people they gank by pretending to be pretentious and philosophical about suicide ganking.
---
Really it seems to me that CODE just wants to blow shit up, and the most convenient and accessible way to get that that they have devised is various methods of suicide ganking, primarily of miners.
---
And personally I think that they'd be better off if they just admitted that they liked to blow up various industrial ships (or just really shiny shit in general) for the hell of it, instead of pretending like it's some higher calling.
---
Also this whole "New Order" thing IMO also skirts pretty close to an (erroneous) invocation of Godwin's Law, but that's just, like, my opinion, man.
---
Hmmmm let me correct myself, I thought I said that INN doesn't do that as much as you would expect.
---
And, well, looking with a bit more of detail, I think that the problem is that you're explaining info that when it comes to the real point of the article, it is not related. Since we are talking about the change of Horde's structure, you could write a bit of background with the previous corps that joined, instead of telling us what are the benefits of joining x corp in Horde and how to do it. I don't need to know that since I'm in another alliance. Sure, someone who is new will find that info useful and interesting, but reading again your comment I want to think that you want to inform about the structural changes only. 
---
ehhhh bait is supposed to be taken. hence the term bait. so never not take the bait is the correct answer
---
Only if that ship is worth 10 000 000. Ten percent of ships worth.... if they only fly 3m frigs you get around 300k 
---
Being a weeknight and the fact that Imperium wardecked all of panfam, I would not doubt it. 
---
I like the fact that they maintain a straight face at all times. I have yet to see one post where they break character, even when exposed to the most vitriolic insults and ad hominems.
---
No, just **Partying**!!!
---
Could you be so kind as to elaborate the hows? 
---
I used to know a guy who would just link himself in local. He'd link the same character that he used to link it.
---
And that was them bridging in less than a minute from ping.... Those super cap pilots are too fucking keen
---
"Tests and an assortment of nobodies"
---
FIFY
---
Another olmeca wall of text ...........
---
&gt;test doesn't have nearly half the people goons has in each system so to say they ran out of space is a little weird.  Frankly, Legacy is very overextended.   To much space, good luck defending it if anyone comes knocking.
---
Remember when TEST decided to dreadbomb under the northen supercap umbrella? Pepperidge Farm remembers
---
So he got a 1 week ban, I honestly wasn't expecting a permaban, nor would he deserve one for a first offence at input broadcasting, just hope your lord Mar5hy doesn't get caught again ;) 
---
Wasn't there some guys doing their own version of this? 
---
Panfam both in isk and objective
---
stop make ppl leave highsec pls. highsec is not that bad anymore with current wardecc mechanics and nullsec is too overwhelming for starters 
---
(i was there, joined PH in first week, nearly quit because i died all the time and couldn't really step up as it was too much to take in. came back to highsec, transferred to fw, then back to null, now 2.5yrs in Test.
---
this way people can learn step by step, make mistakes, lern how to fly ships, learn the different weapon mechanics etc etc without risking too much. a t1 destroyer is already alot for a noob)
---
however: do join a corp! working togethet is many times more fun and often more lucrative
---
nah, we saw them briefly in 2018. at least, right up until ualx.
---
Wo ist der bahnhof... But you need to ask: wo ist der zug? ;) 
---
Well, 1. If you olay regularly (which i will assume) you can go through the titan BPC's over a week. You note: price, name, time contract is made and when you noticed it gone. Thats for the public market.
---
In regards to selling on the goons private market, you have 3 options. Either you make a alt and stick it in there. Option 2 is to join them, and 3 is to find a friend who is willing to import them for ya, against a small markup prooably.
---
Do we have a ~~not dead~~ sub or place to post "want to sell" ads etc?
---
On a totally unrelated note. If anybody wants a fit out and fueled rorqual. Hmu
---
Beautiful idea
---
But knowing Eve players, wouldn't take long to be misused just for laughs
---
Because the alterative is boredom?
---
Incorrect.
---
Where is globby at, he is the guy you ask, im sure he'll help you
---
I spent a couple days idling near hisec miners in a cloaked up falcon once. It was entertaining for a bit. But no way I could have done that long term.
---
Remember when we both learned that FAXes are still stupid OP and entrenched alliances with a supercap umbrella are almost unevictable? 
---
I made myself sad now :(
---
Sorry for your loss.  If you contact CCP and tell them his name, maybe they can identify his character and corp for you?  
---
Who is globby?
---
Mac Products: Just make it look nice so people won't realize the utter lack of functionality.
---
ill try it, thanks for the idea
---
Your OP says otherwise.
---
Yeah but Test is the devil tbh...
---
I waited with my usual ‘No, go away’ till after my question was answered.
---
Yep, this. 
---
Here's a sneak peak at one of my characters:
---
https://i.imgur.com/vxbRf5X.png
---
This is a pretty solid idea. The Eve community on a whole (not just reddit) is more tight knit than most game communities imo
---
Take a step back for a moment and realise that a father has to bury his son. Outside of the game, there are no goonies goons, just people. Hopefully you'll learn how to be a respectful person after getting this comment downvoted to all hell on earth.
---
We were chilling on a lowsec gate once. A transport ship came through. I *just happened* to be in a broadsword. Took the initiative to follow his jump and point him while screaming for the fleet to follow. They reluctantly did.
---
He dropped two plex. (This was when that was a lot of plex).
---
Damn dude. Nice collection. 
---
o7, Godspeed
---
I knew Ashade from back in the day, when we were friends with the old VOLT alliance.
---
I am so sorry for your loss!
---
You mean TEST, which is not a coalition vs NC/PHORDE was the shield timer, trying to make it sound like it was Legacy defending is stupid.
---
o7. Sorry for your loss; bless you and yours.
---
I mean is it even a batphone if they show up on every fight regardless of the situation?lol
---
Are FEDUP part of legacy now?
---
The Connections skill gives you +0.4 to all positive standings per level. Quickly training it to III will instantly open up L2 missions to any corp/faction you don't have negative standings with.
---
O7
---
Please don't make CODE out to be relevant you only encourage them
---
As a risk of sound like "LOL NARRATIVE SPIN"
---
TEST was there to learn how to not use supers and it certainly wasn't to take HORDE's space. 
---
Yes.
---
Imperial Legacy wishes to expand its borders!
---
I paint portraits of capsuleers for ISK. Keeps my account plex'd
---
lol gotta love broadcasting apologists. What's his arse smell like Jake?
---
There's a foot for every shoe. I can think of a couple of ag who did exactly that for years on end. Imagine what they could have accomplished if that dedication had been applied toward something fruitful.
---
I salute you and your obvious goal to fuck with CODE recruitment for the next few months. Now everyone they get is going to look like a spai.
---
Yes this guy sit on a bubble in 97X- he kills mostly small t1 frigs passing from High Sec Empire space to High Solitude. Whenever PvP ships enter he either pulls down his bubble, leaves system or logs completely. My put my alt in that system several times to spook him. The only way to get him to engage is to use an alt from a rookie Corp to get to aggress. 
---
Then when he finally aggro he kites at 25km+ with dual webs hahah! The last time we trapped them he bailed right away and let his buddies die. So yes risk adverse. The misleading thing about this picture is killing a 2 day old player in a heron shows the exact same killing a veteran player.
---
A word of advice, you are allowed so skip a mission offered by an agent every 4 hours, (not cancel once accepted.) This is important as kill missions against other factions have heavy negative standings penalties against those factions. this is especially important in the early days, as you can find yourself locked out of other factions space real quick. It's not a problem to avoid, and running with a few different agents is useful.
---
Cyno is lit. Rest in peace fellow empyrean. o7 
---
Beautiful! 
---
Your corp/alliance forums, discord or whatever you use. Or the official forums have a buy/sell as well. 
---
Thank you, the Salt put a smile on my face. However, I'd like to add my killboard gives a more honest explanation to the kills. 
---
Easier to learn when you’re rich af
---
I can see why NC would find the concept of actually forming for an objective near impossible.
---
No salt here, you’ve never killed me 🤣😂
---
Good point that
---
Yeah, pretty much that's the case. Our 'coalition' is a really unequal partnership that we use as an excuse to get content. All the organizations in it are just probably targets for the people we were going to fight anyway, and making it official gives us at least some benefit in the form of intel and occasional support. 
---
Welcome to low sec, where if you are not an Imperium you are a lone caracal
---
I just like putting Max in there just so I can see you realize killing 3 million isk destroyers with 1.5bil isk Lokis and 2-3 Strats isn’t worth the effort 😂
---
Why do people in YouTube videos always put their Cap boosters in containers?
---
That's great! Either you never engage. Or you just never warp to gate at zero :) 
---
[removed]
---
I actually agree that some stuff wasn't optimal there, he did "ok" considering he was probably picknicking a bit.  
---
Turning off the AB twice is probably the most egregious piloting mistake.  Mostly everything else was generally ok, though I wonder what his friend in the wyvern was shooting at since the targets he had locked weren't taking damage from anything else. 
---
Oh I have engaged. Like I’ve said before. You run for your life every time :) 100mn fit Loki with dual webs. I just point the Stratious instead. 
---
link killboard faggot
---
that moment when eve more than  just a game.  Rest In Peace  Diana Sarain. 
---
You still havnt had a look at the killboard Most isk iv ever made, I'm sorry but I have to disagree with you its worth it. 
---
Nope he did not get a week ban.
---
I honestly would expect a permaban for people who cheat on the game. And also on people who claim someone is cheating without a proof, like you.
---
Imagine being in BL in 2019
---
so is that a lot im not being a dick im just wondering i never seem to get more than 5 then i get blobed lol 
---
Lolol dude I know who you are I’ve seen your killboard. I live in Solitude. I put Max Ryko in there to spook you. 
---
To me it is, some people have had alot more! And yeah bopping can be a problem attempting to do things solo. 
---
Oh yes the blobber Cyno proty! 
---
Because those are Planck containers that can hold 20% more volume than they themselves occupy.
---
Dino here, we need goons to be in the position their in, as they give our coalition a reason to exist and a persistent enemy that rustles our jimmies.
---
Yup that’s literally the only counter to a 100MN, Dual web Arty Loki. Just leave him in system and watch you take down your bubble and leave
---
To be fair if i was in the nid i would have bitched out as well
---
I assume if you are docked while in a ship you aren't skilled for, you'll be back in your pod and ship in the hanger.
---
What happens if I log out in space in a ship I'm unskilled for? Does the ship blow up? Does it become free for anyone to take?
---
I think the best part was that the only miners that realised they were being helped didn't even need it in the first place.
---
I still wonder if the afks ever alt tabbed back and wondered why they were in half shield next to a catalyst wreck 🤔
---
Can't lose them if you don't undock them to fight
---
The obvious implication is that he did not want to use the broadcasting tool to chat.
---
Plus he did not use it for something that could bring him "accrued resource gain" which is still the official CCP stance about what is forbidden and what is not.
---
Remember : what Falcon said 4y ago must still respect the EULA (unless the EULA delegates those explanations to falcon).
---
as stated by others it is mostly just the grind but there are skills you can buy that helps you should also keep in mind that you need to balance out your missions for the other faction or you may find you self unwelcome in other parts of eve 
---
Haha, 100mn,.... 
---
This is what you think, for me he is abuser and cheater.          
---
CCP simply should ban all types of input broadcasting without any type of exceptions.            
---
This situation and everything that is happening around it is best example why. 
---
so how many was that like i said most ever i have had is 5 and its a thrasher parked in jita 
---
Bud you can totally afk camp me.         
---
I live in space where every one can dock in a station that i live in also i don't rat ... this is so utterly booring that if i try i am getting sleepy after 10 minutes.              
---
PL? or PH?
---
It is like being in PL in 2019.....
---
I'm looking for fitting suggestions for a Stabber. It will be used for bumping miners in High-sec. Pilot is an omega clone. I'd like to keep costs down, so I'm not interested in flying the fleet issue version of the hull. I'm definitely interested in going after Ventures and barges. If it's capable of dealing with Orcas also, then that's a bonus.
---
I just cloaky camp a region, income is greatly increased if I use some Input Broadcasting, so much so that I can even afford the occasional week long holiday
---
HTP too scared to try killing it or you retards got Waffles blue?
---
make him pay dearly for not kissing PL ass 
---
247 is what I have, I that Image, but in the comments some peeps have more. 
---
wow i was happy with my 5 lol now im just sad 
---
There is already such a thing. The [Capsuleer Cementery](https://evetravel.wordpress.com/2010/05/16/capsuleer-cemetary/) at Molea II Moon I. CCP switched of can decay around the POS anchored there allowing everyone to anchor a lasting memorial.

Less attention there.

my crappy 4 year old lenovo laptop can play it- inegrated graphics and al.

lol yikes another apologist, whats the tip taste like?
---
I have a MacBook for work where I use OSX, but I don’t wanna spend a bunch more on a gaming PC when I have consoles. I have a lot of games that I like right now and don’t need great graphics to enjoy. Upgrading doesn’t really make sense to me and I don’t make nearly enough money to justify it, yet. 
---
Imo macs in the gaming community are kinda like PT Cruisers - hardly anyone sets out to get one, but the universe just wills it and boom you’re driving something you would’ve never imagined yourself in
---
X47 mk2, anyone ready?
---
No one cares lmao. People die all the time
---
Good for you - for some reason my ships die after getting 1st kill mark ... like every day. 
---
Just out of curiosity, since reps were available on  grid so no need for the hics to warp out, wouldn't have made more sense to use fighters instead of sirens (maybe even instead of the dromis as well) to kill said hics while they were pointing you? 
---
Anyway, fun video and to my surprise I rooted for you (though I like CVA and what they stand for and I profoundly dislike PL).
---
whew lad another cheating apologist :D
---
Did the faggot do it or not? Yes, case closed you fucking retard
---
I would argue that CODE is relevant for the casual high-sec player.  My intention is to destroy some of their financial resources and sow division in their ranks.  I encourage any casual player with a grudge against high-sec griefers to do the same thing. 
---
Boohoo, 'CCPlz do something about botters!! They are ruining the game!!'.
---
CCP does something about botters which makes them get kicked out of their space.
---
*It's about the same amount of inconvenience how long do you realistically think it will be before these bots are set up else where?*
---
*it's not enough of a inconvenience to care. It's not a huge investment to start their vni army again to be spinning in hubs in all their systems.*
---
Pick a side people
---
Whoops. My bad
---
At least your trying =) 
---
the levels of salt over a few bil spent was well worth it
---
Yep! Damn concord ......... like wtf with those guys. 
---
Dude, wtf
---
Fuck off. 
---
How do I join CODE?  Asking for a friend.
---
Thats ESO, its a CCP token that allows you access your character data and use it one sites - same thing zkill uses, the Eve Online site, etc...if you are still worried, get an authenticator app on your phone and run two factor authentication, then you are safe.
---
All that said, you really have little to worry about.

This is very moving.

If you somehow manage to get Caldari to higher tier, botters will just switch sides. It's easier/faster to convert caldari LP because Jita is only 3j from Nourvukaiken. 
---
And most veteran FW players have their alts in opposing militia because that is the most effective way to make isk. Even back in the day when plexing gave 0 lp we had mission running alts in opposing militia because that way you could use your alt to pull missions and make them with your main in friendly systems.
---
FW has always been broken. At least back in the day the farming didn't affect occupancy or docking rights. IMO it was less broken back then. Now it's just annoying bot fest.
---
&gt;Been mining quite a lot in hi sec
---
I will never understand how people can do this and keep their sanity. I guess the sanity aspect is why you are looking up to CODE in the first place. It's like being a torture victim chained to cell and then making friends with the rats that come and eat from your food.
---
" Plus he did not use it for something that could bring him "accrued resource gain" which is still the official CCP stance about what is forbidden and what is not. ' There is no proof of that just there is no proof he did use it for resource gain.   
---
and your link is trumped by the link I posted where Falcon explicitly spells out the rules regarding broadcasting specifically and explains that using it to communicate is against the rules.
---
Hard to pay the rent when CCP take back all that sweet botting money, let's hope this RMT heaven get erased from the map.

May you forever rest in peace and fly through the eternal stars.

Hi sec mining for a nublet isn't that bad. I can afk away while I read up the Eve wiki, cruise the forums and wait to be ganked by a passing CODE agent.

The danger is in doing it for too long.

if you call everything salt, real salt isn't salty no more
---
Stain.            
---
You have most profitable relic sites in the whole New Eden. 
---
Nobody wants a Rorq in a god knows what Region. People sell Rorqs within their alliances, because you can use one only under a thick cap umbrella and it's a bitch to migrate one from Deklein to Esoteria, e.g.
---
Wait, you're that guy! 
---
is this what they call elite F1ing?

Damn that’s p lame, not the direction they said they were going.

.Ashade our thoughts go out to you and your family. You did well with the words you said. Al lthe respect to you and the family. Eve is just a game but our connecions and community are real.

On behalf of a greatfull alliance and corporation, past present and future; For our son, fly safe, forever.

V skill PI on 5 characters, T2 Industry (no caps), some related market trading without hauling, then two AFK VNIs in the back, a Rorq in the front, and an Exhumer I check occasionally all while I play other games.
---
I'm confused has PH decided to stand alone and fight without the rest of thier coalition? 
---
Bullshit, 1 bomb, especially a thermal, won't kill jackdaws unless they're well damaged already.
---
shut up retard
---
So Legacyand Imperium are a coalition?
---
He isn't wrong though. Sansha sites have the best relic sites. If you're lucky you can get 80m from a can.
---
A good idea, that would be simple to do and make the content not be wasted?!
---
What you gonna ask next, OP?
---
- That Resource Wars rewards be updated to not be crap and leave the content unused and dead??
---
- That NPC mining fleets be made to be more than a mere annoyance nobody bother with??
---
- That FW, one of the top places for streaming, not be left to rot??
---
- That Thunderdome Abyss Rooms get more uptime so that the content does not slowly die??
---
You might be asking too much of CCP.
---
its just like fitting plates, more armor hp, less speed and agility 
---
Show me on the venture where CODE touched you.
---
Awesome, this is the trye of info I was looking for.. So would you say all in all, null is better than w space? What level sites are we talking here? Can any ship run them or do you need something more specialized? With more money I would assume the sites are more risky with either worse conquenses for failing or maybe they have rats on them?
---
black skin hides yo from local. 
---
YEAH , ^YEAH, ^^YEAH, ^^^YEAH, ^^^^YEAH, ^^^^^YEAH
---
Ratting is a issue with lots of dudes in one region but for mining we're not even close at using all the resources and space available.
---
Smartbomb?
---
Dino? That's TEST? The guys who fought the Goons in the Fountain war? 
---
Honestly you guys should be more concerned with the growing threat posed by those Chinese guys in the south east corner, Fraternity or whatever they are called. They are going to bury you otherwise.

The Sleeper Caches, specifically this guy right here: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Superior_Sleeper_Cache  More like a big puzzle than just blindly hacking cans. Do a lot of research, look up some videos, be prepared to fail, but you can get a lot of loot.
---
Lazy bait salt is still salt though.
---
at some point they said they will rework killmails so it will show logis/links aswell, so it's very much possible
---
Sansha null &gt; guristas null &gt; wh &gt; other null. T1 explo frigs are cheap. Asteros are better, but more expensive. T2 explo frigs are cheaper, but more skill intensive and not as combat capable as an astero.
---
This is ten percent faction drops, twenty percent market trading
---
Fifteen percent concentrated super ratting
---
Five percent pvp, fifty percent PI

And a hundred percent reason to remember to get heavy water.

Couldn't we you tell the same people that complain about it to leave their nullblocs that they are with because they openly rent to botters.
---
If you think this space or another space test has will be rented out to basically the same people we are in two different realities as we have seen this happen before.

This does nothing to the botters they will just find a new landlord for the time being and buy another vni and go hub spin there. If you think this will hurt them it's a joke.
---
I want something done that will actually have a effect on the botter instead of a mild inconvenience. Like do you honestly believe moving to a different rental space and buying another vni will have any impact on their profits? 
---
Video title is '*The Most EPIC Bait in EVE*'. I was baited into clicking that but there was nothing epic in the video.
---
There is no real "end game", what ever you are doing in Eve. Exploration is a ressource generation activity. Not defended exploration sites are worth for the cans, but the defended ones (in WH space) have shit loot from the can and are only worth it for the blue loot the rats drop. If you're looking at more interesting ressources generation I'm afraid there isn't much to it.
---
If you want run those in a few subcaps then a dude will put a titan on it and it will be gone.
---
Says the big northern blob to the southern blob. 
---
Thank you for the kind words!
---
That's a question for someone several paygrades above me.  All I know is I came back to the game when they moved North the other week.  
---
Thanos will be proud!
---
I am asking about stuff that fall into my interest, as for your queries.          
---
(i don't ask for any items below)           
---
**The Resource Wars**           
---
Idea was good, implementation was very acceptable for area and audience it was designed for.         
---
What killed it was the reward system - you had to pay more for the reward than if you just bought it in Jita ... also you had to put work into getting those LP.              
---
**Fix -&gt;** Remap the reward system to provide something valuable like ability to upgrade batch of T1 modules to meta variations or get  separate 'story line' modules from running those.  For example create mining lasers/strip miners/mining upgrades that you can get by trading T1 or T2 version of the module to get 'story line' version that require less CPU and use less cap (keep other stats the same) ... you just brought back the Resource Wars to life.          
---
**NPC mining fleets** -&gt; people are running those for materials they mine / crates they drop / 'faction' mining upgrades you can find sometimes.              
---
People killing those and are dying to those.          
---
The only improvement i see is to make those NPC to venture into Moon based belts and Ihub ones - so players actually need to contest with them.               
---
**FW** -&gt; I was never interested in FW as i dislike frigates. Honest answer here. CCP could make all FW space cynojammed so new people can do stuff without constant hotdrops.                            
---
**Thunderdome Abyss Rooms** -&gt; i don't play eve for this kind of content. 
---
Rip and fly safe somewhere :p
---
Imperial legacy , baby cakes !!
---
This dude is obsessed with TEST. 
---
isn't that what the eve monument in iceland was about
---
Unless simple mechanic that will spawn a lot of NPC dreads if a super or titan appear on grid ... on top of it of course. 
---
I saw some screenshots a while back with gm deductions to corp wallets.  Maybe they stepped up the focus but its not new
---
i really think it s less clic than super ratting
---
Spawns way too less and has shit loot half the time.
---
Barely medium level content at best.
---
This sounds like exactly what Indiana Jones would be doing... 
---
It should work like bad check laws in the US do, you lose 7 times the value of what you botted for. don't just take the ill gotten gains give them a reason not to associate with those people ever again.
---
Now this was a good aar
---
Idk it seems like there's a ton to it and I've gotten some great info already. Maybe you just didnt understand the question. 
---
What would you suggest in its place then?
---
But aren't u wormholer?
---
just classic bomb :)
---
@boris Stop this shit =) Revenant Pilots Rule EVE
---
The don't need to defend, they can just call the Gon
---
o7  
---
Fair winds and following seas.  
---
Arguably, TEST and Goons combined have the super superiority over everyone else. There is just no point in invading space since it's very boring and there is no straight up gain for it as the largest alliance in the game can live of one region. So except trashing other alliances infrastructure, there isn't much to it. Game is much more fun for them skirmishing and putting pressure on their ennemies rather than straight up destroy them. Even if they are much more economically and empire building orientated, they still want to fight people. The game would be very boring without PvP.
---
&gt; Having achieved that, presuming it's actually possible, would this hypothetical "super alliance" be in a position to lobby CCP for a new server game, i.e. one where every one starts from scratch again?
---
Not going to happen. Many people have put big sums of money into the game, and all of that to vanish would be suicide for CCP. Not a whole lot of people want to regrind SP for years. As glorious sounds the first years of Eve sounds like when you hear about them, many would not start again from 0. I would, and I've put some money into the game, but too many people would not.
---
They bankrolled us for a while as well, and we didn't even have border with them, infact, we lived on the other side of the map #buildersbtw
---
How in the fuck did you get out of rorq tackle and how were faster than the dreads XD
---
Horde bots?!? You can't really bot in horde space, it's too hot
---
It would still be cheesed the fuck out of it just like every PvE.
---
What 2 keepstar on the report, there is 2 keepstar on grid in perimeter now? Hope panfam will make some cleaning :D
---
It seems like, but not really. The mini game is the mini game and that's about it. Sometimes you find a ghost sites, but that's about it. Everything involve PvE.
---
Exploring wise there's nothing genuinely.
---
You can substite with doing combat sites on the side though.
---
Which will get some steps further buts that it really.
---
When you can do both of these, jump into wh life.
---
I would also say that the "end" game for me are both Sleeper caches AND ghost sites (covert research facilities). They are also the most lucrative (and dont believe people that tell you superior sleeper caches are not worth it its wrong). However both need preparation and knowledge about the mechanics so be carefull or you'll die :)
---
I so wanted to join this but unfortunately I had to take nephew to railway station, then go and pick him up again 30 mins later when the overhead lines failed and the trains ground to a halt!  So sorry to have missed it.
---
All the best Ashade.
---
Not sure why the drones weren't already safe if someone was watching intel, but last night I heard that bombers bar bumped a rorq away from its wetu before it could put its drones away.
---
I thought you couldn't kill other peoples stuff on sisi unless they agreed to it or it was at a pvp beacon?
---
Did the server rules change?
---
thats a good reason not to command burst.
---
Also try to find a hub, where you can grab 2-3-4 missions at the same time, this will greatly increase the speed at which you grind your standings.
---
Eve Wiki has a nice page with these to help you localize the good systems:
---
[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Mission\_Hubs#Caldari\_Navy](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Mission_Hubs#Caldari_Navy)
---
I'd like to see the shovel you used to dig up this rotting corpse of a corp.
---
Illegal in most states.
---
Just let dead things lay dude.
---
If this was with Pred you probably would of been killed by "friends" again. 
---
Why do killmarks suck so hard, could they have made them any smaller? Art team does some good work but damn they ate a shit sandwich with killmarks.
---
One session on a proper desktop with a 144hz monitor with the OS and most games installed on an SSD is going to change your opinion on that forever, even with older games. It's not like you need to shell out massive amounts of money either (I get that this is very relative), just do some research and get mid-end components (but with third party cooling so you can crank every last bit of performance out of it semi-safely), build it yourself and it's pretty amazing what kind gaming experience you can buy yourselves for 500-800$. 
---
And once you have a decent desktop, you just make gradual upgrades over the years. Up until about a year ago I still ran a i7 processor from 2009 (OC'ed to within an inch of its life) on an even older MOBO with 1333MHz shit tier memory, but paired with an SSD and a current gen video card, worked absolutely fine. Some people have a lot of cash and like to upgrade to the newest shit ever year, but you absolutely don't have to and can still enjoy great performance out of your setup for years to come.
---
When I use computers at the university now I sperg the fuck out on the inside over having to deal with 60Hz monitors that make my eyes bleed.
---
Oh yeaha... they never shooted the freeports and replaced them with fake freeports.... hmm... 
---
Fly safe to the heavens my brother. o7
---
No it shouldn't.  A fine isn't sufficient for botting.  Botters deserve to be permabanned, and to have their entire accounts deleted (wallet included).
---
Ed, i think you were infected shitposting plague
---
And? What is the issue for letting those sites to be "cheesed" if those people don't have supers or titans?        
---
It is lowsec after all 
---
Nope,
---
This is actually something that myself and CCP Jorg, or our director, have been working on for a little while in our spare time :)
---
It's a project that I've always wanted to see through - looks like this year will be the year :)
---
It's the thought that counts.
---
 Captain, last one burnout launchers?
---
Because test is not in a coalition
---
Recently I don't, but I started rolling in the cash when I seeded the market on a wormhole corps fortizar. Made contracts for the popular doctrine ships at a good markup and brought in billions. 
---
It's still the most complicated data/relic site in the game, so if that's the career you want to pursue then check it out. I mean if all you want to do is make a lot of ISK then there are better ways of doing that, but that's a different question. 
---
I had a lot of fun messing around with Sleeper Caches. I've moved on to other things now, but doing the research and experimenting in the sites was great.
---
More like NC. showing that they have no friends.
---
I was in the legacy fleet. Still had a bunch of fun, nothing quite like trying to dodge a gate boson (I managed it somehow.
---
Props to skillu and co , we naively thought we could out blob. We were wrong. Lessons learnt.
---
Looking forward to our next fight!
---
He admitted last night that all of the hunters are him as well, and he uses a voice changer on teamspeak to stop people finding out it’s all him!
---
I really don't have an answer for the first part.  I wasn't recording so I don't have visual proof but I definitely saw a scram symbol appear before I seemed to enter warp.  The weirdest thing is, there's no record of me actually being warp disrupted whatsoever in my combat logs.  Maybe it's a product of desync? I have no idea.  
---
As to why I was faster than the dreads, DnG is a small group without much in the way of capital assets.  When we drop supers there's not really much chance of getting saved if caught.  For that purpose I refit to hyperspatial lows and istabs for the gank - probably the single intelligent thing I did in that fleet. 
---
he was pretty close to get it out, two shield faxes and some elite maneuvers and he'd lived. yolo all the way tho.
---
Dozen rorquals pulling drones at the exact same second for example... it's not a bot (probably), but someone is using input broadcasting. One person alt-tabbing and using shortcuts still takes 1-2s between accounts, multiple people would be even bigger delays (and there is always one or two afk/ asleep who don't react at all).
---
tbh mining is such an afk-able and boring activity there is not much difference between a bot or a human with 0.2 APM doing it. CCP could change it to be more interactive/ enjoyable(?)..
---
First of all you didn't have right to transfer account to any one.        
---
Second of all if you have the email linked to this account you can recover account this way.         
---
Also if you can prove that you own this account - by for example proving that cash from the sub was coming from your card you can also recover account this way (even if you don't own the email any more).               
---
We like to edge bro dont kinkshame us.
---
It's cruel for a father to bury his son, fly safe and strength to the family.

"united north" &lt;3 lulz     but it sounds better then "the last stand"
---
Oh nice 
---
If you want balance go back to your WoW Arena, friend !
---
As far as the ESI stuff, no, your clicks are not trackable. What people look at in ESI is interactions between people, whether it be via killing them (killmails/lossmails), buying/trading with them, or talking to them (ingame mails, but not convos). They also look at what skills you have, what you are training, your wallet (and market transactions), and your assets.
---
They can no longer see if you have any other characters. They cannot see your account information. They cannot even tell anymore if you are Alpha or Omega.
---
Bitch please, Mommy NC. will be there holding their hands as always :)
---
Because what would make it valuable then ? You can run it more safely in supers in NS, or you're giving faction cap/supers BPC to some randoms in LS which kind of kills the value of it.
---
For all of that dev / designers time is worth this is probably one of the most wasted it can be for LS.
---
Damn. Cyno jamming fw systems is actually something I could get behind. I was thinking removing the ref timer on low power structures would sort of out some the issues in low sec but cyno jamming them (lore could be that it's empire enforced since they want the systems blah blah) would be good
---
Please get in a line. We are   eating shit since the early days of eve.
---
Yep
---
TEST deploys solo to the North, gets outnumbered, brings reinforcements, North reeeeeeeee engaged.
---
Eve working as intended.
---
You can get only capital BPC in lowsec one (unless this was modified by CCP) so only dread or fax there.          
---
Azbel is good choice then from lore perspective.     
---
He was at his ping on the anomaly, but it was kind of a trash ping and put him out of range of all the rocks meaning even if he entered indy core he couldn’t panic.
---
I’m not sure if he warped to his ping because I came in to the system with combats or if I just got really fucking lucky and came at the right time. So if he wants to show his face and explain how he got caught that would be great! 
---
Friendly tip setup a safe pos next time.
---
o7 fly safe!
---
Still a massive waste of dev time considering what LS needs ?
---
Oh, I will turn up my FooF-Playlist as loud as possible when I drive home from work. Thougts will be with you ...
---
Can anyone link to a good tutorial for someone greener than grass? 
---
I seriously have too many questions, even for reddit.
---
Zeguma + 920. in a t3. thats your end game. 
---
I was there last night and heard about the shit ping-- (I was actually the first to spot you in XKZ and report you in intel.)  I also heard someone got bumped off their wetu before they could store their drones?  Not sure if it was the same person or someone else... you guys tackled a bunch of different rorqs in the pocket and I lost track of what was happening to each one.
---
Anyway the thing people don't realize with pings is that a good ping can become a shit ping as rocks in the belt start vanishing.   What was in range can become out of range.  As a belt depletes, new pings need to be made that are within locking range of the final rocks.
---
You're probably not wrong.  Unfortunately pred and I [don't talk much anymore](https://i.imgur.com/KOI9cbd.png)
---
Well on the other hand does lowsec need a content that is accessible only with titans and supers?           
---
Well honestly ... no. 
---
I don't see what makes this unfortunate at all. Congratulations on your freedom! 
---
Pretty sure I'll die plenty but thanks for making sure I'm dying at the right places. 
---
yes, but it's in the game now. If give the choice between reworking that and reworking, say FW, I don't think there is even a choice for the health of the game.
---
Ok so....what do you need to get your bomber to 1 hit kill 45 guys in 1 go....every time I try I only Tickle the shields with my bombs :(
---
and again that is not in the eula, that is in the explanation of CCP stance.. This explanation still must respect the EULA.
---
Thanks for the info! And no, this isn't about "make 14b per tick with this 1 crazy trick!" I just like to explore. 
---
That was great to watch tbh, sad Test didn't save the palatine with double amount of players...
---
no I can't afk camp you. It is so utterly boring I am getting sleepy after 10 min.
---
I understood almost 30% of that! 
---
Not sure about the rorq getting bumped off it’s wetu, I was too busy reshipping so I could go and catch more, Eso is always fun to hunt because you guys generally respond quicker than most other entities so it’s a game of how fats can you get the kills before you get there.
---
Except when you cyno in 20 titans on to our wormhole and listen in on our comms to us devising an escape plan. That’s kind of low but we’ve become use to it lol. Maybe next time I’m in eso I’ll catch your rorqs instead! 
---
Well if reworking it could be -&gt; get whole Sotiyo part -&gt; copy it -&gt; change structure type -&gt; add maximum number of spawns -&gt; add check if aggressive ship is capital or bigger ... then spawn shitload of dreads.          
---
In theory it is new code so it should allow something like this. 
---
There isn't really a lot you can do here. Bumping the gankers of the Citadel would be an option, though they most likely have an anchor point. There is not a lot of room otherwise to kill them. Probably the best you can do is collect the loot they would be making, cutting their profit and either making a profit yourself out of it or returning said loot to the original owner. 
---
Explo end game content is going around in a suitcase T3, running relics, combat sites, ghost sites, ganking vnis, and if you're in an alliance, sharing useful wormhole connections.
---
Don't give away all our secrets Meeqs! :(
---
the post from Falcon is he expounding on what the EULA covers. News Flash YOU don't get to tell CCP what their EULA and rules cover....
---
Seconded, well-written and amusing AAR. You got very lucky. Damn good call scramming the HIC on the iHub though.
---
&gt;Dozen rorquals pulling drones at the exact same second for example
---
or it could just be 12 people sitting in coms laughing at you trying to gank their excavs...
---
good luck getting CCP to actually do that, they seemed obsessed with giving out temp bans for things that should be permabans.
---
Nice AAR
---
We certainly made a mistake warping to the Astra but got a little excited (AUTZ gets a bit dull sometimes).
---
Was a really fun fight. Thanks for bringing it.
---
LoL
---
doesn't it already do that though
---
Yes, and to make chocolate milk you just need to take the milk of a brown cow it's that easy.
---
In highsec? Yeah ok
---
I've had the idea of trying to multibox griffins/kitsunes/blackbirds and try jam out as much of a gank fleet as I can to try fuck with em mid-gank, but I don't spend a lot of time in highsec these days and I'm super uncertain if this would work since the ECM changes.
---
80mill path. Try 140 hehe
---
It's not exactly about space, it's about the relic faction.
---
The average loot of relic sites is fixed, and ATM the value of an average site is 47M for sansha, 40M guristas, 38M serp, 19 and 12 M for angel/blood.
---
In a WH you have +- same chance to find one of each, so avg 31.2 M. However people may cherry pick them and thus, they are worth less average (because more chance to get an angel than a sansha)
---
Your "end goal" is to farm so fast that you can do more sansha relic per hour. Typically your isk/h is 47*relicperhour , with relicperhour increasing when your skill increase, and when your ship is dedicated to scan and relic hackin.

imagine being this triggered in 2019

But that was different.

LUL

then sleeper cache are definitely fun.
---
My advices : astero can perm tank a small(limited) ; stratios can perma tank a medium(standard) but not the AOE when you fail the hacks, also it's faster than T3C ; T3C can tank the superior, even the dual sentry spawn, just not the archive explosion (80k ehp alpha is RIP) and not 3 simultaneous colossal waves
---
because he meant zeugma 
---
content dried up that bad avree? lol
---
I told him to drop the nyx it was all me! Me!

o/ my condolences

It's just being able to make some ISK while being half AFK. I can read Eve wiki stuff/forums to research what I want to learn next in eve, watch youtube videos/guides, or just watch netflix.

It's much more profitable (and fun) to shoot whales than to defend them.

dude from your tone in just this comment i would have banned you aswell. K? bye.
---
WDS is CODE done right.  
---
Sure, you can make a name for yourself pulling off some epic scam or grand heist but that takes some serious creativity now that so many have been done to death and so many of those exploits can be seen coming miles away.
---
Those that think Eve is just a small gang or solo PvP playground hate to hear this but this game is actually pretty true to how nations are built IRL. You can make a pretty good living doing exactly what people IRL got rich and famous from... profiting from the war effort! Mining, ship/equipment building, market PvP, running a huge buyback, hauling... all these space jobs are vital to big corps and when you get good at them, people pay attention. But then the key is to take it to that next level. Turn a one man industry biz that builds and sells vexors to newbs into a conglomerate that absorbs competing buybacks, holds a monopoly on cap building for your alliance, and attain so much industrial power that you effectively have a big corp's CEO by the balls and can influence military, defense sov acquisition, etc.
---
The thing about work MacBooks is they hold their functionality.  My last one lasted for 10 years, perfectly fine for the stuff it was used for, but I didn’t try any real gaming on it, even when it was new.  Same was I wouldn’t try to edit documents or slides on a PlayStation.
---
News flash players only agreed on the EULA, not on a random post on a random forum.
---
This post is not law. It can be used to understand CCP stance but CCP officials still have to conform to the EULA. And when the EULA says something is not forbidden, then this thing is not forbidden and can't be claimed as forbidden.
---
According to the EULA, using broadcasting to type in the chat without getting an accrued resource is not something forbidden.
---
SO, it is not forbidden. You can cry as much as you want, it just is not. Though of course it may be subject to spamming policies.
---
Were you drunk when you made this?
---
I can confirm. Yesterday I was warped few times as well
---
Just joined WH, i see that everyone here doing PI so am thinking to setup few lava planets to check it out.
---
Yes, let's name it "No Expectations" and anchor a keepstar in 4C-
---
If you cant beat em join em...get some friends together and gank the bumpers or the hauler they use to scoop the loot.  
---
By jamming the gank fleet the best you can hope to do is prevent them ganking their target outright and making them wait 15mins to finish the job.
---
Non copy pasted part : Eve is a sandbox and there are WAY too many things to explain even at the start. Figuring stuff out is part of the game. Best advice and you will find it bellow, is to join a corp and have people answer your every question.
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
That sounds like something you may actually want to recommend. Sounds like lots of fun :)
---
Did u cap roush
---
It's the high sec part that I find torture. For the same time spent doing the same afk mining in null you could start practicing your Scrooge McDuck isk dives.
---
thx u2
---
AFAIR, the Eve Monument lists every subbed user on a particular date? 
---
Yeah, bit it's been adopted by the community already, so it fits. 
---
It surely beats "F". 
---
Whatever answers you get in here, OP, don't turn into that asshole who cherry picks cans and leaves the scraps.    
---
Yours truly &lt;3
---
In low/null they'd face opposition from people fitted to actually fight, completely different thing.
---
If you don't shitfit, run hulks/mackinaws AFK in busy systems, or purposefully taunt gankers then the likelihood of you being ganked in hisec is relatively small.

48 when i died me and my buddy where pretty close and sharing them across the 2 revs :D would have been pretty close to100
---
It's a date, then. I'll bring my floweriest impairor
---
wish i did lol got too close to eu tz without realising how late it was :D
---
News Flash, the EULA states CCP is allowed to change it at ANY TIME without notice and players have no choice but to accept it.... did you ever read the thing you are talking about?????
---
I say, Take it an sell the ship cause people love buying ships with tons of killmarks
---
don't worry papa goon will be there to help out
---
possible a decent idea with swapping the siren but i didn't really have time to swap in the fight and i need to keep the dromi for the application.
---
Could be an alien with multiple tentacles playing on 10 computers simultaneously, who knows.. 
---
Well, PL is blue to waffles and waffles blue to PL. HTP are all alts of PL soooo what do you think?
---
Exactly you don't know anything, all you have is just more wild accusations with no screen shots or proof...
---
Sotyos were never intended to be doable in supers. At least not in the way they are now. 
---
The only and best solution would be to nerf the "sniper fighters appoach". Titan one needs not to be nerfed, it is damn risky, and 2 sabres can get titans killed by npc.
---
Awesome! 
---
T4 darks atm, burners before that. Both is worth around 250-300 an hour not counting big drops.
---
Now always idea is to spawn them in lowsec only with capitals on grid, and swarm of those if titans or supers arrive. 
---
I'm not sure your opinion is supposed to be relevant when it comes to people mourning a loved one kiddo
---
In case you were wondering why this one is going for so much bidwise (as I was initially), it might be because it has a ton of signatures from Devs.
---
boi don't tell me what I can't do I'll shoot what I wANT
---
They where initially not intended and you done it in a swarm of small ships - then CCP changed this to never ending swarm of subapitals capable of instantly killing anything smaller than a capital.        
---
best name I saw was Tapirium
---
Just don't enable him, it only feeds his retardation
---
So what you are actually asking for is more titans and supers coming to lowsec to hit something thats easier than a npc sotiyo, but still drops the same things?
---
Not sure why he's so bent over about BSC, was just asking in my snuggly way. I usually assume ex-member; it wasn't some PvP gloat. If you're measuring BSC's success over a green leet skeet killboard, you'd be doing it wrong.
---
Come out to the coast, have a few laughs...
---
that bait was pretty meta; i too thought that the video would be *about* the most epic bait in eve, while what transpired was that the video *was* the bait, and epic was how many people watch that video expecting something worthwhile.  
---
Found the edgelord.
---
&gt; the EULA states CCP is allowed to change it at ANY TIME without notice and players have no choice but to accept it.
---
Yeah, and ? Dude your sentence make no sense. Just because they change it does not mean it's not the law anymore.
---
&gt; That's not random, that's the rules coming from teh people that make them, the longer you talk the more fake your argument sounds.
---
Unless expressly stated otherwise in the EULA, this is a random forum by a random person in regard to what the EULA accept or not.
---
Even if falcon says "playing two accounts is forbidden", unless it's specifically written in the EULA this is not a reason to ban people who play two accounts.
---
This post is ONLY an explanation of what CCP stance is concerning grey areas, it can not be used as a basis for what is accepted and not in the game.
---
That would be one end game. You can stumble upon scannable 10 10 ded and also refit to pvp when you want to.
---
After getting turbodunked in nearly every engagement in the last weeks where papa goon wasn't there to hold their hand, TEST needed some sort of morale victory. Very evident by the propoganda posting in the discord image posted.

400m explosion radius means it will apply less dmg to target with lower signature. Idk if velocity affects it as well, can't find explosion velocity stat (it does affect missiles). If your target is smaller than a BS and has mwd turned off it will take little dmg. In case of those mining barges with shield extender rigs, they took 50-70% bomb dmg
---
And retrievers have poor tank. If your target is buffor tanked/ high resist ship, you will do little dmg (%) even if the bomb applies full dmg..
---
why doesn't concord destroy citadels giving tether to criminals? 
---
The Lachesis exists.  72k heated disruptor range with true sansha or republic fleet.  And no warning until you land in the room with them.
---
Was there.  Great seeing the support for a fellow player. Sad and uplifting.
---
you should probably just tell CCP you forgot your username and password
---
" Just because they change it does not mean it's not the law anymore." How does that sentence even make sense to you? If they change the EULA then the law changes because the EULA **IS** the law.
---
" unless it's specifically written in the EULA this is not a reason to ban people who play two accounts. " Are you drunk? This is not a debate about whether or not multi-boxing is legal or not, Falcon specifically says multi-boxing is legal in that same post. We are discussing input broadcasting. A tactic made possible by third party software, specifically called out as against the rules of the game by a DEV for the game in the games OFFICIAL forum. I have never seen someone defend a cheater like this before... It makes me wonder if you are just a broadcaster trying to defend his cheating way of life.
---
Or TEST realized their botting empire was going to fall and decided to do something.
---
Problem with that though: A) having customers B) having 75b to buy even a single titan bpo in the first place..
---
Yes because sitting in HS gates waiting for a freighter to be ganked is so much FUN.
---
Sounds like a good fight, I'm just sad I wasn't there to loot the field.
---
Also, one of those Zealots had rigs in cargo, must have been a blood pumping scramble to get ships on grid.
---
Hisec income is irrelevant conoared to null income. And code lives off those donations, you wont accomplish anything. Better to leave hisec and make some proper isk
---
There are people sitting on gates waiting to shoot at flashy catalysts pretending to make a difference getting confused why did they still managed to kill the freighter. Who knows what's going on in their heads.
---
lol bad spy 
---
Trusting idiots \^ wewlad
---
i think its because Supers need something like 25 points to get actually scrammed (or was that just titans?) 
---
Your alliance leaders know both who and how much your botters contribute to the alliance and allow botting, they just hide it from the line members.
---
But if they are holding hands... how will NC undock?
---
I so understand the stress in the situation, but damn i was so waiting for you to turn the NSF off to save cap, might have got you out. But in this situation we all can be smart afterwards, well done using it.
---
If you're going to post this at least understand how webbing works
---

If you bring titan or super you will spawn a lot of NPC dreads - aka mechanic forcing you to bring subcapital DPS with fax or not.

For pure exploration, Nullsec is the best space, ideally you are member of one of the blocks, so you can explore in almost complete safety.
---
We had a thread here not long ago, where someone really collected numbers. Sansha space is the best, closely followed by Gurista space. Serpentis is still good, then there's nothing mediocre and Angels+Blood Raiders is bad.
---
There is no "end game" really. Sleeper caches are more difficult to run (especially the superior ones, but even limited sleeper caches are dangerous if you don't know how to handle them). You can also have a strong PVE ship at hand and run the combat sites you find with your scanning. Some of them can drop very valuable loot.
---
If you enjoy exploration you should rather do actual exploring. Search Wormholes connections directly into High Sec or for fights and ganks, find a sellable J-system or low power/reinforced citadels for fights and loot.

Legacy is easily 10k  bigger than PANFAM, add Imperiums 50k on top of that

what northern blob?

tfw a fucking *nano nyx* escapes your trap
---
Dam I wanted to say that :p
---
look at that salvage tho dude 
---
Or one big boi hic point. Supers get the bonus too though, 5 per carrier skill level.
---
whatabout the time where you didnt have bombers or fighters and just vomited out 15 warrior I's instead and murderized frigs w/ that 
---
yupp. First DD's were like huge smartbombs, dealing excessive amount of omnidirectional damage. This was later revised to having a directional Doomsday device, which would wreck anything it's pointed at. I think after the revision two Heavy Interdictors flying for Severance were first blood. (I can remember one of the pilots saying something like "There was a wall of light and I was back in station, in a pod")
---
yee hic is made to be the "SUPER POINT", specificly made to hold down supercapital ships 
---
but when CO2 wanted the systems in feyth that was promised to them it was a huge betrayal, nice
---
Wait I ran hundreds of sleeper caches and you tell me it drops from them ? or maybe its only on the limited ones ?
---
you mean good luck to yourself when your pets are attacked 
---
zeugma balls?
---
Impressive how big one could get when you dont have to hide alts in npc/alt/rentercorps to make some iskies. 2/3 of those numbers is easily production/pi/sience/extractor farms.. numbergames is fun. 
---
Ratting, but I think about starting a \~\~scam operation\~\~ trade hub game show.
---
the fleet stabber can fit a 500mn and bumps caps (like orcas) better than a mach
---
it was the standard bump vessel of freight club last I checked
---
test deployed, not the rest of legacy
---
I'd love to see guristas forward operating base in the hands of players or just regular FOB's. They'd be really useful for low-sec gate camping, as you could quickly deploy them and warp to them. They'd be perfect for the nomadic playstyle.
---
I mean the major thing I see he did wrong bar the alignment issue was taking his dromi off the hic that's 24km away allowing it to get back into point range easier, the revs application will apply to a hic pretty easy without a dromi on it. Also using the same dmg type fibos to the rat damage means you might have to spend more time on grid with a target to kill. Cap booster should of been running when he loaded grid and that's just a few but everyone makes mistakes in situations like this.
---
Since no one else has spelled it out: DO NOT WEB A FREIGHTER GETTING BUMPED. You are literally helping the bumper.
---
You want to help them, bring alpha against the mach or logibro enough to help him survive until concord D-Day.
---
And test also ree'd because they were outnumbered after they tried to outnumber horde. I find it pretty funny that all this is caused by us reffing a keep because they did not show up for a final.

https://imperium.news/2018-q4-nullsec-roundup/

&gt;Generally speaking, it seems as if WC have been looking to consolidate their current holdings and to not antagonise their situation too much. There have been some very interesting, large-scale battles involving subcaps, but large scale capital engagements have not been as evident. The agreements that WC have in place are being upheld, which is a sign of either character or weakness.
---
And that author is a koolaid chugging as they come.
---
I guess u rly are just retarded 
---
accounting for alt corps in wermt wouldn't really add a lot, maybe half of wermt is NC/PL alts, so say 2k chars.
---
And even if you accounted for wermt, bot, and gotg (which no one know what will do) Legacy would still outnumber the north easily, and with Imperium they would be at least twice as big.
---
500mn? I might have to have another look at it, and try some combinations in the fitting tool. I can't afford it yet, but something to keep in mind for the future.
---
cyano jam systems with &gt; 75% contest. you either bring caps before hand or gate them in.
---
fight with a coalition against a alliance. get butthurt for 3 months and then claim you won after 3 months as coalition vs a alliance.... \~Goonlife :D

This is high sec we're talking about, only horde has ships staged there from the north 
---
A big ball of nope.avi or just one giant middle finger with NOPE.AVI tattooed on it.
---
your basic fit is compact 500mn, 2-3 overdrives, and cap recharge so you can run it long enough to get up to speed
---
warp to the belt at 100, point your vessel at the enemy, and be patient while you accelerate because it takes a while
---
overheat for the last 1-2 cycles

you should hit 8-10km/s shortly before contact

Thanks for the advice.

Sad part is those botters will be welcome with open arms by HRE renters or BOT.

The typical “we big cause we have alts/inactives” whine.

It wasn't written by someone mourning a lost one.

Dude get yourself together.

No matter how deep you are indoctrinated in your side's propaganda removing some bot lords is a good thing.

Amok flair checks out

Legacy fleet landed on a bubbled gate. 2 seconds (or there abouts) after decelling out of warp. Cyno goes up and titan jumps it. This wasnt a out of warp boson. Just actual slow brains.
---
But if someone chooses to use it as words to express their anguish then who are we to say otherwise?
---
Yeah, I mean it's not terrible and it is definitely nice to have something as a community to commemorate those lost, but I certainly wouldn't complain if it was something else haha.
---
btw
---
Jnderrated comment.
---
It was so cool when we sat on the Azbel with our 500+ dudes and TAPI wouldnt want to fight. There was an expectation that we would head over to their keepstar and force a fight. Awesome moment
---
your not using the omega? or any slot 7-10 implants?
---
Nice to see FEDUP is doing well down there.....
---
Hey if someone who has lost someone uses it in their post dedicated to their lost one, they go for it, I'm certainly not going to bash on someone already down. It's that it's just posted as a random copy pasta by those posting replies in those threads that I'd say people find cringey. Which is understandable, I'm more inclined to write something myself if I'm going to pay my respects to someone rather than just copy pasting something.
---
Now that you asked help from your masters, we might not, yeah. :D

I have Australian friends in eve so I will try to ask around and see if they can name any names.

I was completely blown away by this!! As eve players we blow each others stuff up. Make life on the game miserable for one another on a daily basis. Shit talk each other all day. A lot of people think eve players are not a very nice group.......

This shows the strength we have as a community and that no matter what happens in game we are all brothers and sisters in real life.

People ask me why i love eve so much and this is the reason. The love and solidarity people show each other in amongst all the bad things going on in the world.

Also they aren't a wormhole Corp.
---
But not necessarily in that order.
---
You know the one that force TEST to go South and become bluetral to Goons to avoid the threat of NCPL invasion ?
---
you mean the one that TEST it self outnumbered? 
---
This!
---
Considering the game mechanics we have right now, this is the best way to deal with gankers at the moment.
---
You mean the openly recruiting newbro alliance compared to the high SP / "quality" pilot orientated ones ?
---
Because everybody is recording 24/7 and thinking about making series of screenshots (one would not be enough as it doesn't show when and where drones go) while flying tackle or setting up a bomb run.
---
Not having proof doesn't mean you don't know how to recognize bots or isboxer users. I know, you know, CCP knows, no one cares. Unless it gets to front page of reddit or makes gaming news like marshy it's not worth to bother reporting.
---
Test super fleet is surely only newbros 
---
and horde is elite pvp vouch only
---
stop posting
---
The state of TEST super fleet 2 years ago was much different.
---
Bridge it. Duh
---
The only change is they could then lock you up while jammed, with their close range weapons
---
we're not talking about two years ago.
---
You have to understand, they had to nerf tracking titans back then as one special entity could not deal with it even with 10:1 numbers.
---
Now as this entity has catched up and overtaken in Titan numbers, no point in denying them the op fun mkay?
---
[I was, if you're following a bit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/akdzae/tapi_once_again_showing_it_is_a_strong/ef632bl/)

That does sound interesting.

But as someone that spends the majority of their time in fw space. Please god no.

Would have lived if he had smartbombs and neuts and proper dunk fit just saying, I agree with tank but pretty much the rest of it is very situational at best, I would only use that fit inside my own super umbrella with them already formed with faxs jumping in from the beginning. But back to business if u look at that vid at the very end there he was only tackled by a single dicter bubble, smartbombs would have solved that issue straight up, with the neuts being able to neut out the hics and dictors, like even if he had the neuts and smartbombs and then still had the weird fit in mids and lows, he still would have lived. But alas I guess there are several moments there that adrenaline made some bad judgement calls and I guess until ur in that situation u will never know how ur Gona react. Props on posting the vid was nice to watch. 
---
As if that was the only time NC/PL went against TEST
---
Or you could say "we tiny cause only pvp alts allowed", any way you wanna swing it friend. In the end, active pewpew pilots defines size.
---
Yes they were single target but with more damage than the ones now and could hit subcaps
---
this is much appreciated let us all know when this happens so we can make an event out of it
---
Nice write up
---
Ask your friend for it back? I sure hope you didn’t sell it, my dude. 
---
Is ganking the flavor of the month again to pitchfork for ?
---
you gotta be (Zandalari)trolling me
---
Since it's not written in the EULA, it's not a bannable offense. Even if falcon said it is in a previous post.
---
Even if you keep crying in a corner, input broadcasting it still is not one.
---
I have never seen anyone trying to make up something so wrong as you are.
---
So basically CCP would need to burn all ISK that has been transferred from KWG to TEST in the last months / years as it is mostly botting money. 
---
*takes tin foil hat* also a good way to launder your botting money. 
---
Step 1 create a botting alliance with your bot account
---
Step 2 Get a shitload of botting ISK
---
Step 3 pay your Main Account "rent" for the ratting space
---
Step 4 ??? 
---
Step 5 profit
---
C5 ratting
---
Oh, fair enough, I guess I just saw that as explaining the existing structure because some people might think Pandemic Horde Inc, Blessed Bean and Horde Vanguard *are* multiple corps and therefore this isn't major change; but they're really like a stepladder under the same leadership and rules.
---
Maybe I could have been clearer about what I was explaining and why. Thanks for the feedback though.
---
But did the Ihub die?
---
о7 Fly safe 
---
I’ll start the bidding at .01 isk
---
You argue like a genuine child its scary
---
Depends on fit. HAW fits loose A LOT of tank to fit more application. 
---
And anti-cap active fit dread could tank 2+ supers. 
---
Additionally, you can find all this out by simulating in pyfa vOv
---
not got a life yet?
---
imagine talking about yourself in third person
---
Shoot, jam/EWAR them when they land, or provide reps to their target. You can easily take one or even a couple of them out of the fight, especially if you know where they are going to land. 
---
But don't expect to stop all of them. Even with the overwhelming advantage of CONCORD and the FacPo on your side, you won't be able to win 20-to-1 against a competent opponent. Find some friends if you really want to disrupt them. A small squad of remote reps or smart jammers will neutralize a large portion of their fleet. 
---
Cringe aside, you basically want to infiltrate CODE., one of the groups known to be somewhat proficient in ganking and griefing, but you literally have 0 experience in joining corporations, not even for legit and non spy reasons.
---
Apart from the fact you're vastly overestimating how much people actually care about CODE., I can already tell you you're not only looking at this the right angle, you're getting obsessed and with your wrong mindset and naive new-player-EVE-bushido, and you will not succeed. People don't just create random noob alts and infiltrate renowned groups and just fuck them all over. Spying takes time, experience and the only profitable way to do it is if you're actually killing the people you spy on. There is no reason to do that if you're against CODE. If you think the main people in CODE. will ever let a random alpha nooblet hold any position whatsoever, you're gravely mistaken.
---
 Leaders in this game don't just let people hold positions of power because they're being soft spoken nice diplomatic sounding people, but because they FC or create content in other ways or are a vital part of the corps infrastructure. None of those are things you will be able to achieve in any reasonable timeframe as a nooblet in CODE., especially since there is no reason for CODE. leadership to get bigger. All ships are T1 trash and you dont need 50 directors to hand them out to your F1 monkeys before a gank. 
---
Now that I'm here, let me just elaborate on bullshit new player E-bushido. We get it, you're new, you think this is a game like any others, so understandably the first time you got ganked it stinged because you still feel entitled to your gameplay and your rocks and your ability to safely make ISK. 
---
Now that you got ganked, you think CODE. must be a huge menace, and that most of EVE suffers under the great threat they pose. Surely, if you try and rile up other peaceful HS miners, you can do something!!1! Well no, let me give you two reasons why I'm calling you a naive guy that needs to learn a lot about EVE 'mindsets' 
---
A) Evading CODE. is probably the easiest thing there is. If you're not mining AFK, it might take you a week, hell if you're focused maybe half a day, to go read up and practice the easy thing that is being aligned and warping off when threatened. Oh, you don't wanna be at the screen all the time while mining? Well, tough shit. Most of EVE agrees you should die, as do you apparently.
---
B) Most people, after playing a while, realize that there is no moral in this game. The only way to grief someone here is to take it to real life, as any actions within the EULA in game, repeated or not, are simply fair game. Every one of us at the start of playing EVE used to think like you. Now let me ask you, who do you think gets more good boy points from the rest of EVEs community, the corp that creates content, gets frags and reduces AFK mining in the shittiest regions in the game, or the salty naive nooblet that thinks he can just topple it over because he lost his barge? The sooner you realize every ship that undocks is a target and that you will die in this game but you have to learn how not to, the sooner your EVE experience will turn for the much better!
---
Also jfc what is wrong with me for seriousposting like that
---
also multiple (shareable) hangars plz k thx
---
oh no not the catalysts!!!
---
Explosion velocity and ship velocity affect missiles, not bombs. Bombs are only affected by signature.
---
Are you an alt of that "asking tips for building a covert ops squad" guy?
---
So many of us are taken too soon and no words said can ease the burden of your loss. Know that amongst the stars where you see a new star alight in the sky, that his journey was made successfully and he will always be with you. Condolences to you and your family.

theres no need for the remote repairer, so that should help you cap a lot. also, consider a second cap battery
---
&gt; Legacy would still outnumber the north easily, and with Imperium they would be at least twice as big.
---
You'd think panfam HC would have stopped to look around and figure out what they're doing wrong to be unable to attract players to their retirement home anymore. Kinda hard when old school semi afk HC is the problem though.

anti-ganking is a worthless occupation 
---
from what I was told it was originally a thing for Vile Rat, then every passed away EVE player, until the idea shifted into what it is today
---
&gt; It all started when I woke up on a beautiful Sunday morning in Amarr FW to find that the minmitar system next door to DnG staging was contested to 80%. We plexed the system throughout the day Sunday, making sure to find the time for our daily feed to DHSJ. Eventually though, we plexed the system to 100% contestion at around 06:00 eve time.
---
I already love this post, it is fucking nice to read about something that is happening somewhere in fw. Pls keep on doing whatever you do. (Don't mistake the tone, I'm not ironic.)
---
Depending on how you and they are fit, you can tank a super or two, but the sad reality is it's really rare for their to be just one. Solo dreads, like really everything else, gets trumped by supers. 
---
do you still hate snuff :) ?

Thank you very much!
---
The context was the keepstar fight, which was TEST VS NC/HORDE.
---
Which we were outnumbered, yes Legacy outnumbers Panfam but they were not there. 
---
I no longer really give a shit about training skills or making money, so I just extract on some highsec alts to pay for my accounts.
---
Ooo can I see some examples?
---
Isk-per-hour, stick to nullsec sansha and guristas. 
---
If you stick with your astero, you might catch and kill another explo ship. Plan for it. If you fly T2 explo, you become a target but will scan down and clear sites possibly faster.
---
If you want puzzles, try the sleeper sites. E-Uni has great guides for them, just google it. They have 3 tiers, all have possibly lower isk-per-hour rewards than sansha/guri, 3rd tier is a biatch to scan down and even worse to clear.
---
If you want adrenaline runs, try wormholes. If you want adrenaline bursts, try ghost sites (they have a hidden timer that kills you and VERY good loot). You can combine wh and ghost sites and die from heart attacks.
---
If you plan to get in wh, Eve scout is a useful resource and maybe you wanna join the signal cartel. Google them both.
---
There's no end goal. Explo is money-making. Use the money to fund another activity. I find it the most enjoyable one, compared to mining and VNI ratting. Carrier ratting is just as engaging with less adrenaline.
---
Should have bubled 
---
Don't they already have their annual fake coup right before burn Jita?  Or am I thinking of some other highsec bois

---
If you don't have a preferred ship, maybe some racial art? If it has to be ships in combat, showing the artist "30 wallpapers per second" aka "EvE: Citadel Cinematic Trailer" would inspire him a lot I think.
---
A tackle Rorq specifically fit can do that but you need to apply all the scrams before the nerd warps.
---
I wonder if that had anything to do with the introduction of Rorquals, big think.
---
I can run 3 clients on my netbook, might want to double check that.
---
Just shoot the freighter wrecks? It may take a few of you in Tornados but if you don't really care about getting CONCORD'd, at least you will be able to enjoy ganker tears when denying them their hard earned loot.
---
bring back cyno doomsdays we'll see the real bitchin then.

*notices your frigates clumped up*
---
OwO what's this!?
---
**You need to duel a webber or better have alt in the same corp like you are** - without webber don't have any chance in helping you as :        
---
* usually 1st webbing attempt not always work - and at this point webber is dead and cannot help you for next ~20min.              
---
* webbing usually is under gate guns so unless this is 'this perfect web moment' webber need to be alive much loner than 1 tick so you slow down and warp much faster than freighter without any web.             
---
* webber ship usually cost - so unless this is not your alt - no one will risk a killright and its own assets for every dumb freighter              
---
We didn't blueball you on the KS shield timer when you had the numbers, hopefully your balls drop and you take a lopsided engagement when it's your turn.
---
I read this AAR entirely in your voice. It felt like I was there.
---
Oh wow that's brilliant hahahaha
---
Wrong.    
---
It is about skill - a webber can do miracles if the bumper is bad, also there can be situation where webbing you in correct moment will save your life.      
---
Simply both freighter and the webber have to talk to each other.            
---
Looking at the report it looks near parity, just the nestor losses are fucking your totals

Depending if you just captured a guy moving 20bil by Uedama or you decided to autopilot your 20bil freighter by Uedama.

But thanks for bringing the fight it was a bunch of fun. Would welp again.

Concord is dumb mechanic, as it is totally against player sandbox.

Faction police should be buffed and concord removed.

Welcome to lowsec....
---
.02 isk
---
I don't want a LS gate to stain. Lowsec sucks.
---
Does that count as shitpost? Mom?
---
I hunted this guy for nearly 2 months... I finally had an opportunity to get him while he was swapping systems... unfortunately he warped his mack squad in groups of 5 and I dropped a HAW dread to take them out, not the full squad but it felt good.
---
Brain.exe stoped working forgot fw was in low
---
It has more to do with TEST realizing they following Goons way of turtling and focusing on industry was a much better way to get stronger than providing content for players and thus possibility getting evicted, all that to have "fun" and attract members.
---
Rorquals aren't necessarily the big issue, the big issue is very large alliances being able to live off a single region due to the low respawn time of anomalies. If alliances would have to spread more, members would have to spread, many rorquals, supers and carriers would be outside umbrellas, harder to defend. Or umrbellas smallers and subject to dread bombs and all. And maybe require more subcaps to defend, coming the new fatigue-less jump gates.
---
F
---
Oh yeah, ships where being pulled out of every hangar and corp contracts to keep a small crew in the fight.
---
Blame the French?
---
That is why you hire consultants until you have enough core knowledge of the tech to do it on your own. 
---
It's ok. Even ccp forgot about fw.
---
You can do a Sotiyo in a solo carrier.  You don't need a super.  No hacks, just be smart. 
---
Yes they're broken.  Much preferred the 300 punishers than sneaky solo windfalls we're getting now.  You know, if you want to take that thing down, you damned well need to bring a full fleet.  I also don't like the drop sniping very much.  In fact it's loathsome.  I hate it.  
---
CCP screwed up Sotiyos so badly it's kind-of laughable. 
---
No one had the energy left after like 1.5 hour of high intensity hijincks.
---
Have it require ozone from players, I'd like to chuck a few million in :)
---
Yes. 
---
Oh please do it !       
---
You don't imagine how i want this now !
---
I'm missing why it's a problem to do it with a full fleet of punishers?  I mean let's face it, that's much more effort than a couple of Titans. 
---
&gt;returning said loot to the original owner               
---
Like this never will happen ;D          
---
Also many anti - gankers state that freighter pilots **need to share** cargo if they are "saved" by them                
---
I don't disagree with you, but wasn't the topic production of super capitals? 
---
it makes sense too, why can i sit in high sec on a citadel with all the might of concord orbiting me without them doing anything
---
CCP changed rats **and** added webs to the structure - so any kiting ships will die.         
---
Those rats always warp to you - wherever you are on the grid - they will warp to you.             
---
Completely agree, I've done this before. I also tell them -1 whatever I'm piloting put irl stuff came up. No one has ever shown issue with that. They just glad you let them know.
---
If the bumper is bad, almost anything can help. Hell, if they're bad, just go bump them and it might also work.
---
It's not "simply put". You're assuming the bumper is actively making mistakes, I'm assuming the bumper is doing it correctly. The latter is the safer assumption for the freighter pilot. And I don't trust some random person to understand when and how a web can save the pilot in certain cases.
---
So my statement stands. Don't web a bumped freighter. It is much safer to assume that will hurt rather than help.
---
Agreed I was being considerate if I was being honest 000
---
Holy shit that was a fun fight and yeah the second you drop rage pings went out pretty quickly. “ LOG THE FUCK IN “ 
---
Oh my gaawd! :joy_cat:
---
Hey bjor long time no see, Marc’s own balls slowed him down. I imagine he thought what would Doom do and then did the opposite because he isn’t a tool.
---
If you roam the same routes regularly then you're shooting yourself in the foot doing it. There are definitely spawn mechanics and limits, and I have often triggered a new relic site in the same system by finishing another. 
---
Yep they are damaged now.           
---
300 punishers, 30 dudes in faction battleships with T2 logi wing or fax support but (like WTF) not titans and especially supers sitting out of aggro range and being totally ignored.          
---
Does your family know how much you suck off Doom?
---
Have you played EVE recently? Like did you see how much rubber banding ... how much rubber banding .... Have you played EVE recently? Like did you see how much rubber banding is happening on the server. You don't have to be bad, simply sever can help yo ... how much rubber banding .....

Underrated comment
---
Neat comment. Stop encouraging people to accept duels from people they don't know and to get their bumped freighters webbed. This is terrible advice.
---
Should be around the same time star Citizen gets released finally.
---
O7 safe travels.
---
Nice, had to turn off audio, though - the music was giving me an instant headache.
---
If rorqual are more dunkable, supers production get slower and we get more content. I'm not saying rorquals don't need a nerf for mining ability and defense (PANIC being a completely retarded mechanics), but in the end, but if there was one change to implement, if would be this one. It impacts roamers, gives value to NS space (which is either half empty or overcrowded), nerf turtling and all. Let's be honest, we're not going to see a rorqual nerf. I'm the first to defend the CSM about many thing but you're not going to see them push for a rorqual mining yield nerf.

On serious note.

Gankers don't need tether - since the beginning of EVE they managed to live without it.        
---
It helps a bit when you are lazy, but from i know - gankers usually keep ships undocked to annoy people. Like you make a bookmark, put a ships with AB/stable MWD on ... and go afk.

You literally just said you hope the numbers are even so it doesnt turn into a blueball...

Also from the Br. I seen, it was 650 vs 450 ships, if that's even, your math is bad.

&gt;**I will use my alts to clear higsec from every freeport that i find!**
---
Im stupid, though it wouldn't be a bad thing 
---
Your endgame as an explorer is going to be in Bob's country. Key ships you should look into are the T3s, bombers, and the stratios. Asteros btw never loose there effectiveness. I've seen them take down some large prey when you know what you're doing. Your probes are your bread and butter. Get them probe skills up and join a wormhole corp to learn the ropes. After that you can specialize; maybe you want to find loot pinyata structures in wormholes to bash, maybe you hunt other explorers. Bomber's Bar has hunting trips you can go on as well to eventually learn how to be a hunter for a black ops fleet. If PVP isn't your thing there is always signal cartel.  As for relics, Sansha type sites are best, do them in null and wh space as barely worth it in hs or ls.

Confirm he says Yippie caille in French

Also : never not blame the French !
---
To which me te level do yoj research them? 
---
Why do you choose to web their anchor over the broadcast most of the time?
---
Did it end up destroyed ? Couldn't find the KB for it, impressive losses in perimeter tough !
---
Twice the isk, double the fall.
---
Nah that advice was good. The stuff I objected to was bad advice. But definitely every freighter needs a webby buddy. Just not when you're getting bumped, unless there's really, truly a golden moment (those exist, I agree). But I don't trust anyone to know when that moment is. So I'd rather people just not web freighters getting bumped. Logi em instead, they might survive.
---
theres quite a bit room between l33t green killboard (which i dont have myself either) and getting farmed absolutely nonstop 
---
mass recruiting newbies into null just to tell them to roll over and die the second reds are in system is just sad  
---
&gt; I was never interested in FW as i dislike frigates. Honest answer here. CCP could make all FW space cynojammed so new people can do stuff without constant hotdrops. 
---
Plexes, where most fights happen are already gated anyway.
---
That was like 2 years ago, and corpse collectors doesn't represent any faction on tq
---
Funny thing is you have to be a freighter ganker to understand the involved mechanics and actually do some effective anti-ganking stuff ... but then again, who will go back to AG after they see the light?
---
Ha, knew the north would want a round 2 somewhere outside a titans reach
---
Losing 500+ dreads is an expensive lesson. And if I was a betting man, I think you're going to lose the perimeter KS in the long run.

lol, 200 vs 475

465 to 629. but I am sure with the initial engagement and the following 5 hours the concern was about what was trickling in rather than a 20% advantage in highsec where it will just volley through anyway.  
---
As for my hopes, if you formed 200 dudes would you take a 2k man blob? Why are you not feeding me silv? Extreme example I know, but I am framing it in a way that makes the problem obvious, at a certain point futile is futile.
---
do you want to hear a story about my 413 loses?
---
Good thing that's not what they're told. Sorry you're so triggered by the newbros coming to hang out with us in null.
---
Meanwhile our corp members are having fun playing a video game and learning a little each day. We're trying to help and spend time with them to help them have the most fun. Part of that is letting them lose some ships and showing them how that's ok and what can be done better.
---
Perfect? Not at all, but it's fun and most seem to enjoy it.
---
I've tried to recover an old character/account in a similar situation. The staff seemed like they were playing ball, taking old payment info and all sorts of other stuff that'd help prove I'm the original owner, but since the account in my case had been subbed a lot by someone other than me, they just told me there was nothing they could do.
---
I tried a second time a year later, same result. I don't get the impression the account got banned, and the staff seemed to believe it was mine but now someone else was playing it, etc.
---
Tbh hard choice when i think about it.             
---
Ouch

You're running out of free ports though.

Try to gate a battleship or battlecruiser ... how likely you will get dropped?         
---
It is about letting those players to advance in ship classes and not to keep them in frigates.         
---
Which proves my point wrong where? They are better skilled pilots, but please point to me a fight they took that they knew they couldn't win? Headshotting every FC in every fleet isn't making yourself look good
---
so rorqs shouldn’t be able to warp or have have invul, why not just make a beacon pop up when they hit siege as well. it’s capital tier miner that gets killed every day by maybe 2 sins or 5 cruisers while holding a 10 billion price tag. might aswell fly a super carrier and make 300mil ticks instead for the same price, and no stuck in space button. 
---
Well having a chat open to a webbing guy (or better alt) , when you align your freighter to a spot and see a window of opportunity - just to apply webs at this point will only help. 
---
I was in a wormhole and found a Nostromo Station.
---
Ok, lets go with active pilots. I quickly added up active characters in the past 7 days for Panfam/Legacy/Imperium.
---
Panfam: 3.3k
---
Legacy: 3.5k
---
Imperium: 5.7k
---
Imperium + Legacy: 9.2k
---
Sure! I set this up recently: [https://www.caelintsukaya.com](https://www.caelintsukaya.com)
---
Keep in contact, but don't let someone web you if you're bumped. It's highly unlikely to help. I'd rather that webber go run and get a logi ship honestly. Even if it's T1
---
To understand what can you to disrupt them, you have to participate yourself in freighter ganking (as no ganker will pass on that information). Like anything else in EvE, this is about learning by doing.
---
Unfortunately, I have serious doubts that you will go back to anti-ganking once you tasted the blood &amp; tears.
---
Careful mr. waffle, your salt is showing.
---
From an outside perspective this loss was 100% funded by the super pilots' hubris. Repeated drops using the same cyno ares, in the same time period, for multiple sequential days (1 Jan to 6 Jan, 15 Jan-18 Jan...). 
---
All they had to do was keep an eye out for Olivia Jenkins in an ares and put out some retarded bait (I mean, when these guys drop on T1 mining barge for three days straight, a battleship must look extra juicy...).
---
:3
---
sounds like a regular first wormhole experience.  minus the ransom
---
Think harder
---
It’s on their website 
---
If you web the anchor, your web applies to their whole fleet. If you web primary, you web one dude.
---
You know ... the bumper/scanner will rely how many chars are/will be helping the freighter ... the FC just have to adjust the number of dps chars in his fleet.
---
Good Fight there Skillu and Scourge, we shall see you for the next timer.
---
One hella boson there.
---
Yea man, why won't they feed, why won't they deliberately loose
---
Also dropping a titan on field isn't risk averse in my book
---
Don't you mean lowjinks XD
---
It's a shame all the Elo and marshy white knights will downvote you. 
---
He's ours, stay away. 
---
I knew about the sleeper sites and still have forgot and flown in there and lost asteros...
---
Well I know it will happen it is okay. It is for those white knights too!
---
Same experience... with second Astero too :D and third one too.... Every ship will be destroyed, sooner or later. 
---
You're running out of members tough :(  Did you ever does the math how much Raitarus and Astrahuses Delve is generating every minute ? :/
---
If you are a criminal, you cannot tether and Concord will destroy you on the Citadel undock. However, -5 and less is not a criminal and Concord does not care about you unless you actually shoot at someone.

If the "e" is actually an "e" with an acute accent "é" then it actually has an "ay" pronunciation to it.  So if the spelling was "Caillé" then it would literally be pronounced "kai-eh". Caillé is the French word for "quail" or "curdled".

Your theory is disproven by many eye witnesses like me that:

- saw the Feyth-Gila-Bots with own eyes ....
---
Good point. I don't explore that often so I tend to take what I find, be it good cans or trash. 
---
&gt; So where do you find the most expensive loot while exploring? 
---
Oh, I believe the cans with best loot are named "Ruins"

Need to leave at least Jump Freighters through and if you cyno jammed all the FW systems, you'll find navigating new eden in a jump capable ship just got to be a major major headache if you're looking for a few mids with NPC station and you don't happen to be in Goonswarm/PL/blue-everywhere BS.
---
I disagree with all people that claim the current economic meta of EVE is healty, no matter what flair they have. It just seems to happen that koolaid-driven posting with ignoring hard facts (as current PLEX market developement) just comes from one flair group.
---
we could just be bitches and ref it some sphere hax... or just a bouncing around throw away doctrine like max DPS tornados or some shit \^\^
---
Not all lowsec just FW, there is always way around - and if not then maybe pulling 1-2 systems from FW will not do much harm.
---
The Shattered Wormholes - I know that in the era of POSes they were impossible to habitate, as you need a moon to anchor your POS to. Has this changed with Citadels? Can I anchor Astrahus within the Shattered system?
---
I made a few bil manipulating the market on Eagles when test adopted them for a new doctrine. 
---
How about cyno jamming as a system upgrade \*and\* when the IHUB is vulnerable? That way  our Nyx can molest the IHUB without a bunch of aussies dropping rorqs and dreads? :)

You'll need to socialize and actually take part. 
---
Tbh, this post is worse than any of Elo's posts.
---
His posts were annoying, but it did get people talking about it a little bit. This is just whining.
---
I also like how you decide to lump input broadcasters in with bots, then decide that Elo is hypocritical for not complaining about input broadcasters, because *you* lumped them in with bots.
---
Chat servers are aws I think. 
---
May he forever travel the stars. It's never easy loosing someone close to us. My condolences.
---
there are a bunch of german corps, so many that there even is a german recruiting channel. I got back into the game and got a fitting german corp in less than a day
---
the question is whether whoever replaces them are equally bad botlords
---
You mean the nerf release a few weeks ago ? Or the theoretical Patch leak from CSM that your spodbrain came out with ?  
---
Why? The Imperium isn't even fully utilizing the space it already has, why would we want to spread ourselves thin for something we don't want or need?
---
We learned a very valuable lesson when we were evicted from the North: that owning space just for the sake of owning space is a really great way to lose all of your space. A lesson that many of the  alliances that kicked us out still have not learned (I'm looking at you GOTG).
---
I hope you can notify his Eve mates. My condolences to you and your family. 07
---
Gf. That fight was a total cluster fuck.
---
Oh god yes hahahaha
---
I would pay so much money for this
---
Our Botting/RMT Empire need more space 
---
Pretty sure we've taken plenty of fights like that, such as ZMV the other day.
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30004820/201901252100/
---
Maybe you should ask yourself why you couldn't eke out a win yesterday, when we're in the heaviest n+1 meta in years and you outnumbered us by like 3:1.
---
No, no.  You misunderstood the question.  It wasn't "How do you spend your money?", it was "How do you make your money?"
---
The nerf weeks ago didnt change much. And they already said anoms will be further balanced during that nerf.
---
Do keep at your Grr Olmeca tho. I didn't even say there is anything wrong with CSM hearing the upcoming patches and positioning their empires respectfully. That happens all the time.
---
Glad to see KWG getting hit — I can only hope Omist gets similar treatment. Botters being able to exist so long in the southeast corner of the map is dumb.
---
You headshot every FC in that fight. Please try again
---
I have been checking on there, but since I don't know anything about any of the German groups in general, I don't know which one is not ideal, usually the people here know best.
---
Day 1 of your posting not banned.
---
EVE is real!
---
&gt;made the announcement to the applause and cheers of a small hand-selected audience at their headquarters in Iceland.
---
Oof. Someone call the fire department.
---
I really have to start checking who the submitter is before reading articles. 
---
As a German, German alliances usually are dumpster-tier renter/indu garbage, alliances like Lumpy and Ev0ke are/were big unique exceptions.
---
As for corps, many of the big alliances have German corps, and me and many other Germans enjoy the combination of German corp + international alliance.
---
From the top of my mind I know of NC.(FSR and LFT), Tapi(HDZ), Darkness.(TWIUS) and Goons(KMW), but like I said, if you browse through dotlan you will probably find even more with various alliances.
---
German ingame help and recruitment channels are a dumpsterfire, I  would recommend avoiding those.
---
You guys bailed on that keepstar fight with enough parity in titans and supers to keep it interesting.
---
Horde might take close fights, but we know daddy NC. and PL won't.  
---
The 1dq1 keepstar doesn't have a sun at it. This isn't a picture of the thread topic, but just a random screenshot. I don't get it

Are you fucking retarded?

Which one? All the ones I am thinking of we were getting less reinforcements because ustz was not big enough. We could take it on in EUTZ, not us.

turn on your brain for a minute

When i finally got gud at catching them ccp changed the mechanics.
---
its weird how most people are drawn to their national peers but germans seem to avoid eachother for the most part (t.german)
---
My guess was that there will be further nerfs that will necessitate you to expand.
---
Yes, that was a very good call.
---
ITT: NO, YOU'RE THE BIGGER BLUE DONUT!!! 
---
As before : you cannot anchor big structures in shattered wormholes, including citadels :/
---
This, however, does not apply to the smallest anchorable structures like mobile depot.
---
I honestly don't know what's worse. Your post, or the fact I watched the whole video.  SHAME ON YOU.
---
Anyone remember the horizontal NeoCom prototype? For some reason I liked it a lot more than the vertical one.
---
What's your Astero fit that is worth 130m? I'm having trouble imagining what you would put in there for exploration? 
---
I've recovered accounts that I've biomassed, forgotten the user name AND lost access to the email account I used. Basically all I had was the character name, and customer support was still able to get the account back to me, so it is possible, but it will probably take a bit of back and forth with a GM. As long as you didn't sell the character officially and your friend didn't change the email account, you should be fine.
---
FYI: you can view all of the accounts linked to any single email by logging into the EVE website using any known account linked to that email.
---
There still seem to be 4 constellations in Feythabolis belonging to that alliance. Both on dotlan, and in-game.

Just a quick question : why should we right click stuff ? I enjoy using the left button !
---
i too mwd directly into a boson
---
I was there and got owned lol
---
Yep I’ve had mine since 2014 and it’s been great. Had one issue that I couldn’t do anything about, but I took it in and they fixed it without charge with no warranty
---
I built a PC a few years back that got nuked by a power surge. I agree, it’s really a game changing experience. I definitely want to upgrade but right now it doesn’t make sense for me just yet
---
RA decided to stop paying protection money?
---
All over Pure Blind a few month back and recently all over Khevala
---
I thought it was build way before he died and there is supposed to be some sort of time cache
---
You mean when GOTG and NC. Fleets were following GOONS south and you guys decided to not log back in after crash?
---
I will not post anymore regarding this. But incoherence? Point it out please! I will make sure if and when I post next I would try not to do the same mistake!
---
Good read! One question - What does "mid" mean in this context?
---
&gt; RC dreads mid from staging
---
I have little to no experience with anything regarding caps. I've seen this word used a few times and I have no idea what it means "to mid." 
---
I wont chain post on this lol. Don't worry. And great job with those excess! o7 Love that dedication! 
---
We never got to commit, node died before we could. Buddy, we even contested the sov under your capital umbrella, if you really need me to I can pull a br from my reddit history. But I am pretty sure at this point no amount of proof is ever going to be enough.
---
Try it in WH space. Even dipping into a C1 or C2, watching D scan, trying to move around... it will get your heart pumping knowing you have to hack as fast as possible and get out, because you never know when there is a cloaked proteus 10k off.
---
You will lose a few exploration ships.  Implant accordingly.
---
this is what aDapTiNg tO thE mEtA looks like
---
You sure input broadcasting cannot be used for krabbing?? Or it makes 0 difference whatsoever?? You just hate my opinion. Its fine
---
baited on a free title
---
:(
---
flair checks out
---
Cock blocked for the win
---
It brings up the contextual menu. "Show Info" is your friend, especially in the beginning when you don't recognize the type of ship or rat just from the name. 
---
Also you can look there to see all the possibilities the game can offer 
---
https://www.alpha-orbital.com/assets/images/post_img/eve-career-chart.jpg
---
No problem man - keep asking these kinds of questions.  It's the fastest way to learn about game mechanics.
---
Capitals have a finite jump range and when they find their target system to be beyond that range, they can either start taking gates to get closer to target system, or, they can "mid" - or jump to a cyno in a closer system which is either in range of the target system or along a route that brings them _closer_ to target system.
---
I should specify I'm referring to Goons / Delve. The Imperium alliances as a whole do own a lot of space, including Querios that we use as an incubator for small groups to cut their teeth in, but all of our economic and military powerhouse is confined solely in Delve. And even with the absurd amount of Rorqual miners and super carrier ratters, and even after all of the nerfs, we still have a lot of room to grow in Delve. We took Farms and Fields to heart and we adapted to the new meta. Now the rest of the game looks at the MER every month and instead of trying to figure out what they're doing wrong that we are doing right, everyone just complains about rorquals and  anom nerfs and how Goons are holed up in fortress Delve. (not saying that you are complaining, but a lot of people are). We've said all along that any nerf that is designed to hurt us will hurt every other group much harder.
---
I mean they are basically the CODE of WHs, so it's somewhat fitting they would show up in this thread.
---
&gt; usually the people here know best
---
not sure if serious ... insert Fry meme
---
cuz germans on the internet tend to be pretty fucking retarded
---
Ah I see. Thanks for the quick response! o7
---
True it's a bit confusing, it was more of an advice to right rick everything to discover options you might not know about, but but the short cuts through the LMB are indeed much more efficient.
---
is there a cringier alliance in this entire game?
---
No I think your just delusional. Or uninformed. Or both
---
xxdeath did this for years aswell as renting out systems for irl cash instead of isk.
---
Just saw marshy last night......hmmmm
---
Miss you guys, that br makes me miss you even more. Happy you didn't feed the nyx dad. 
---
And are you surprised Potato Elite blocked you?
---
And? A 10/10 requires more investment and also has shit loot 70% of the time 
---
nope
---
Being german myself I can tell you to never join a german group in this game.
---
On average german players in EVE are PVEers that go full indy / carebear mode with no necessity to do anything related to self improvement or to increase their PVP skills what so ever. TBH i dont know why but thats my experiance. PVP and skill progression is a cornerstone even for laid back casual players.
---
Join an international eutz corp. Besides the more natural repesentation of EVE gameplay the cultural exchange and the chance to train my english skills in word and writing are actually pretty awesome. I consider this a main feature of this game.
---
TLDR: The international community in EVE is great. German only groups suck.
---
a CFC by any other name...
---
I thought it was but i dont fucking know anymore. Narrative is for roleplayers.
---
i guess like the last time?
---
I don't engage with this goon pride narrative unless I have to. Congratulations for figuring out consolidating space is the only option currently. Other alliances can't do what you do because by definition it's only accessible to the largest supercap umbrella and it's blues. And some like panfam just aren't interested in a krab empire playstyle. Despite it has been buffed consistently over the years. So we'll played by getting CCP buffs.
---
If anoms were nerfed so you had to spread to 4 supercap umbrellas that would even the playing field a bit with respect to krabbing risk. Although you already widened the assets gap so much past few years, so it wouldn't make goons susceptible to eviction again.
---
Because its almost guaranteed drama. Here are your options:
---
* Your leader is an unemployed bump, that is looking to find the reason for his existance in the game. They tend to attempt to compensate for their real-life by claiming superiority with regards to everything in the game. These groups tend to be amongst those that perform the best, but are a toxic shitshow.
---
* You get the (very) young idealists, who think it is a good a idea to regulate everything. So you get a 100 page rulebook, that manages every aspect of the community in detail. As soon as any conflict arises, people start to rule-lawyer who is right. Most of those groups are semi-democratic with some sort of council and they seem to be doing pretty decent when starting, but I have yet to see a group that doesn't spawn one or more splinter-groups after a conflict - each with their own (slightly different) rulebook.
---
* You have "the couple" as leaders of the group. Most of the time it is the husband, who actually holds the "official" leading position, but his wife manages pretty much all of the day to day stuff, albeit with a certain "focus", that isn't ingame-efficiency. Chances are you won't find another female in those groups. These groups generally perform pretty bad, but they have the most pleasent atmosphere out of the three mentioned.
---
Which is also the reason you barely see german-only alliances. While it is nice to have some german guys around you to speak to, as long as it's only your corp, you still have some other people (in the alliance) to do stuff with, if people get hot-headed again.
---
Look up bomb launchers. It's a special weapon only for stealth bombers that has to be manually aimed and does area of effect damage.
---
Not that I know of, but I will check tonight
---
This was hysterically written. Thanks for sharing!
---
(Love from GalMil)
---
Someone has to mine all that ore for the construction of the Great Gate to Stain
---
There are expomentially more 10/10s available any day than superior caches.
---
And as I said next step wh's.
---
For which you need high sp rattle/gila/ishtars etc or t3cs. Same as null combat sites.
---
I read 'Unfuck' instead of 'Undock'.
---
It’s almost as if there was a CSM leak or something 
---
Block = Win
---
that's a no

you underestimate how easy it is to press 1 button

Sad, but fact.

Leo version is obviously better

1 button across 10 rorqs. Yeahhhhhh. Why defend cheater input broad cast reeee. Cheater defender reeee wahhhh. Ban himz plz 
---
That's the real question. Was it a strategic victory?
---
jibrish yourself 
---
Nice.
---
The Cyno is lit.  
---
o7 fly safe.
---
Fall to who?  
---
No, join  up and make some friends. 
---
Joining a goon bot corp and they demanded proof of loyalty?
---
+1 for our boy Sparton
---
How can I shoehorn my alliance into this AAR which I was completely uninvolved in
---
not really
---
Ohai mikal ♥️
---
reading your AAR made my monday less shitty(because its monday) thank you!
---
To answer your question - no
---
But what is the point of your mining ? What goals do you have in eve? If you don't care about the other parts of the game and more importantly you don't care about the social aspect then what's the fucking point of playing. 
---
They also know if you've been evading taxes irl.
---
how many points do you get on a rorq? 7 mids w/ 6 heavy scram II's ... yea that will do it  
---
What's the leak?
---
Spai
---
Nah, if anything I assumed waffles pilots had more than two braincells to rub together.
---
Frechheit!
---
Very cool!
---
So easy low sec access then? 
---
Yes I know I misspelt everything. But I can’t be fucked to fix it. 
---
mittani did say the russians sold it to goon and they are moveing out whitin 30 days or something.
---
dont think he say what they will do whit it but as long as goonsand test is semi blue its the safest ratting space in eve 
---
Yes, CO2's leader was the most level-headed and detail-oriented person in all of New Eden.     I can't think of anyone more prudent and reasonable.
---
Those Unsecured and Forgotten sites are the ultimate noob trap from CCP. They are neither unsecured nor forgotten.
---
Damn, that's a lot of momentum
---
cool blog
---
GOTG is up there, but to answer your question no...
---
I heard you say subcats.
---
Cultural victory maintained
---
why join goons when u can just join pl hello
---
Yes I know I miss spelt everything. Will I fix it ? Probably not 
---
No this is the perfect place for these interests.
---
still gonna catch bots that way 
---
Just a lighthearted post trying to help poor T3 Cruiser mains trying to make a living on zkill. Yw. 
---
The guys are having some fun not all people in this game are try hards yk
---
You might find it interesting and profitable to turn that t1 and t2 salvage into rigs and sell them around null sec.Rigs are very hard to find around null and you could be selling them for 10x their worth in materials.
---
Totes
---
I guess but I've never seen exploration bots before. 
---
maybe he just wants to see his wallet raise and buy big stuff to feel important?
---
Meh
---
Looks like it also doesn’t go well. 
---
If you aim for nullsec I can really suggest Karmafleet. Many germans there and requirements are almost non existant (three strategic fleets in three months, an internet capable computer and a pulse, a brain is not required).
---
he said eve not dota or pubg
---
98 mil is the most I've seen. 14 Intact plates and some other stuff in a LEVEL ONE Sansha ruins. 
---
Don't we all :p
---
So isn't pressing ONE button to give a command to 10 Accounts simultaneously called "input broadcasting" and bannable? Asking for a friend ...
---
never post again
---
bad people? i do hope they refering to goons. otherwise i'll have to bring up the nazi "are we the baddies" gif to describe ya
---
Dude...you have a kid, you'll watch that hundreds of times
---
:thumbsup:
---
It's funny how super-capitals are kinda effective in this game.  
---
Almost like they're worth the price. 
---
Also DNG is recruiting if you have more questions.  
---
The Rorqual at the top and the bottom Rorqual whose excavators you clicked scooped at different ticks.
---
This was not broadcast.
---
All corps have some pap requirements for gsf.
---
We couldn't reach the engagement system in a single jump, so we had to jump to a midpoint from our staging area, wait out our red timer, then jump into the engagement.  Added 4-5 minutes on to the ordeal.
---
Found the Loki pilot.
---
They have got to be behind on rent by more than a week for Test to start evicting them
---
okay i guess... alot of spod. spod is bad hmmkay?
---
You keep trying to blame other groups for not catching up as you continue to awox their embryonic catch-up efforts (and brag about it on Reddit), hotdrop their efforts, and support campaigns by your pets and sock puppets from across the galaxy. Then say it's their laziness that's holding them back. 
---
I don't exactly blame you guys for *continuing to play the game*, but don't blame laziness. CCP's rich-get-richer mechanics were bound to catapult one group into exponential growth first and then slam the door on anyone trying to follow.
---
yes, but I'm at work surrounded by other adults and they all heard me watching it.  Now everyone is looking at me different :'(
---
It could also be that I forgot to wear pants to work again....
---
freight club made it famous using it to bump jfs off the undock of non kickouts, I think they still use it bumping jfs out of jump range of hs gates
---
Just a FYI , Legacy without TEST is called Voltron.
---
Bait post is real 
---
Yup, that was my first thought when I heard about it last week. 
---
Ill sneak in his topic and add to that: 
---
I want to mainly mine, PvP fleet maybe once or twice a month (untill I got some comfortable ISK wallet and I can slapblob ships np). Probs even in Rorqual if protection allows it. Which corp best to join? I too just wanna come home from a hard day and mine a lil. Im fine with paying part of my income, either deposits of m3 of ore/ice/gas or tax/payment from ratting w/e. 
---
Is there a reason you should not post at r/eve?
---
So delayed imput broadcasting
---
If you literally don't care about anything other than making money you can most likely just join whatever group. I'd imagine goons will be a safe place for you. However I'm pretty sure they demand you to join in on X amount of ops or something similar per month.
---
Either that or just rent space from someone, no need to do any of that. The system(s) are all yours.
---
Every time I read "shit loot", I've learned to interpret that as code for "shit loot compared to what I get carrier ratting and Rorqualing in sovereign nullsec".
---
In other words, the loot would probably be thrilling and game-changing for the OP and anyone at his level of experience.
---
Mbloc 
---
Anom nerfs I reckon
---
yes, but it's laughably easy to tab through 10 accounts and press that 1 button on each 
---
if you check the battle report:
---

---
you can see there were 3 of them
---
Nah. Shit loot compared to most level 3 relics. Far easier. Far more common. Much faster.
---
I lived in PB for a while back in 2008.  If I remember correctly it wasn't a bad place to live, only it was a pain in the bum for logistics.  I guess it still is.
---
I will continue to brazenly and cheerfully cherry-pick in the exact fashion you hate, fueled by the tears you emit while you sit in your cloaked Tengu frustrated that I didn't hack the can you were camping.
---
https://youtu.be/5hfYJsQAhl0
---
Join PL. Atleast Hedliner acts like the late Angela Merkel. 
---
Or maybe different people?
---
It's scary how accurate this is. When I started playing in 2008 I was in a small German corp that fit the third point to the letter.
---
Dave Archer (above) was right.  Mostly likely this is just another opportunity for locust fleet.  I mean if the current residents aren't taking full advantage of it...
---
That Loki could be a bait looking for a bigger catch than a Heron.
---
Moving capitals to a system between where you are staged and the target.
---
Having two mid points would mean
---
Staging system -&gt; Mid Point A system -&gt; Mid Point B system -&gt; Target system
---
I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Legacy, is in fact, TEST/Voltron, or as I've recently taken to calling it, TEST plus Voltron. Voltron is not a coalition unto itself, but rather another component of a fully working coalition made useful by the TEST doctrines, mildirs and infrastructure comprising a full coalition as defined by CONCORD.
---
Muh German Efficient Engineering bro.
---
Buy German Dreads only. Thankx.
---
At the beginning of the video, you say that the objective is to kill an anchoring astrahus. If I remember correctly, that astrahus has been there for a week now. Maybe even more.
---
Nice read, glad your nyx lived to see another day.
---
He's been flairbaiting for two weeks. Not TEST. He's too dumb for even us. 
---
Red are getting evicted
---
Bad = Panfam sorry
---
hai zeeb &lt;3
---
Go back to flairbaiting as CODE. You're too stupid for TEST, and that says it all. 
---
The Gon will control you. Forever.
---
It's almost like, when you're fighting in someone space, they have the advantage because supers.
---
Stain isn't going to help you. It's crowded by not just fellow explorers, but bots. The place is picked clean.
---
It's also swarming with hunters, to include StainGuy, which is why he's inviting you there.
---
Do wormholes. You'll have sites from every faction, including the less profitable ones, but you'll come out richer by 1) finding more cans and 2) dying less often.
---
Goons have requirements for when you can and cannot do things. Stuff like CTAs and required Ops. If you wanna just rat and maybe mine, you're likely better off elsewhere. 
---
Wait, you claim that this is a fight for Y-F, but most of your footage is from ZMV?
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Was this "elite" Horde Vanguard? 
---
I'm not german, but I still don't really get this isolationist mentality of just playing with people of your own country.
---
I feed on your reactions. Keep them coming. Thanks.
---
Are you talking about Horde?  That's not really embryonic is it.  How long have they been around?  What have they done in that time?  If it hasn't happened for them yet it never will.
---
The problem you have with Goons, I think, is its superb organisation.  It can sit in fortress Delve mining in Rorqs and awox your catch-up efforts simultaneously.   There's nothing to be done about it.  You just have to hope it collapses due to boredom/not having any enemies to fight.  
---

Building Apostles for sale in fw low soon, that is how you basically force every decent fw lowsec group to keep FAX cache in every system they're interested in doing stuff in.
---
Possible. But you don't even fully locust Fountain, so why would you need Period Basis? Also, you can just make a deal for moons like you do with QFC. Complete takeover seems drastic. Plus the other thing with TEST\KWG.
---
Good words core. 
---
Just post detailed info on r/eve but make sure to not bring attention to your own allies' botting, and claim that those 15 accounts being controlled by two button clicks isn't ruining the game.
---
Get a bunch of kids to follow you and bash anyone who points out your hypocrisy.
---
Shitpost every day.
---
Disappear because you were full of shit all along, and when attention starts being put on your own allies, you lay low like it wasn't your fault.
---
This post gives me PTSD. I also recommend the working CEO who logs in 2 times a year to hold grand self indulged speeches only to vanish and letting his host of Co-ceos micromanage every aspect of your life.
---
They have enough members . The End
---
Ah yes that was a miss label on the vid. Fixed now 😅 thanks.
---
It was the ZMV Astra they tried to anchor 
---
He didn't say try hard corp, he said laid back.
---
Sabres don't work that way in lowsec (which was mentioned), and trying to keep HIC alive against both several supers and bunch of angry NPCs is a little difficult.
---
Ocam's Razor:  Something, something CSM conspiracy NDA, etc. or do Goons want to Locust fleet Period Basis, as they do Fountain and Querious?
---
It's time to unite all server under goon flag!
---
So the input broadcasting situation wasn’t evidence?
---
I agree. It's just like loosing 300 dreads.
---
Approved.
---
They don't accept tryhards that fly AT ships, nice try
---
Hardly,   You can call PL baddies if you want.
---
But hordes good.   
---
Goons is more bad guys than horde
---
As they say on your council estate
---
*amaze balls*
---
2 fleets per month is hard to do
---
If you use something like EVE-O preview, you can click through all screens quickly. Can get drones on a recall for 6 screens in about 1 to 2 seconds total if shift-R takes. Sometimes the thumb mouse key makes shift-R broken. Using more than 3 becomes quite active to keep them moving between rocks when they die and watching vigilantly for a dread spawn that 1 shots drones.
---
heh I was about to comment the same. My 1 yo loves this shit, and it somehow gets into your brain after you hear  it one gozillion times. 
---
i wouldnt advice anyone to join try hard corps and never did so in the past. if u think try hard means anything besides indy / carebear then i am sorry for you

Why does a takeover seem "drastic"?  I don't do diplo so I don't know what's going on over there.  Perhaps the residents are moving on.  Perhaps they wouldn't give Goons the moons for Locust, so Goons told them to leave.  There are many options over and above the CSM conspiracy theory that your confirmation bias prefers.
---
There are huuundreds. The prices on relics has went significantly down in the past 2 years because of exploration bots, and they're also the reason it's much harder to find relics in nullsec than it was a few years ago.
---
Did the keepstar die?
---
ofcourse you can have them on stations or citadels, but if you are dying now, have fun warping  them to you on time.      
---
Now they just jump to you. 
---
My 6y/o loves it, lost track how many times we watched it

That is kind of the issue with all the nationality/language based corps (except Russians, due to size of their community) - if you have a corp built around out-of-game relations, you will end up with this weird mix of people with vastly different experiences and expectations when it comes to EVE, and unless the group is large enough for that mix to subdivide based on interests either alone or inside larger organisation (Horde, Goons), it will cause frictions and arguments. International EUTZ corp is good idea; German corp in international alliance can also work, but then you need to accept the fact that everyone will do quite a lot of activities outside corp, with rest of alliance.

[https://forums.eveonline.com/c/de/rekrutierung](https://forums.eveonline.com/c/de/rekrutierung) is the german recruiting subforum. There is also a german wh discord: [https://discord.gg/qXnMvF](https://discord.gg/qXnMvF)
---
I have been part of lots of fun german corps that have at this point disbanded, Vision Inc is still there tho.
---
Regarding non-blob warfare corps I can highly recommend Kill at will and Little Red Riding Hole, depends if you want more null or wh content, probably the highest quality PvP you can find speaking our language, while staying casual friendly and laid back. 
---
Also shoutout to Magister Mortalis and the much more newbie friendly TrueLove and BOSS guys.
---
I do not recommend the recruiting channel.

Please seek mental help

/u/Fafer is a good man
---
tldw? aside from cringe though
---
&gt;Are you talking about Horde? That's not really embryonic is it. How long have they been around? What have they done in that time? If it hasn't happened for them yet it never will.
---
1) I said their efforts were embryonic, not the alliances themselves, get reading comprehension. 2) They're not the only ones.
---
3) I don't have a problem with an alliance succeeding. My only concern is how CCP has made it impossible for anyone to follow due to exponential force projection. It guarantees this server following in the footsteps of the Chinese one.
---
Normal horde
---
how come I see this thing everywhere? I remember it was some insane german lady that did this 10 years ago https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi4m5ZcbSfc
---
Starts with "sisters"
---
35k players disagree wjth you.
---
&gt;Goons are fine, even great these days. If you want a reason to hate them now, you'll have to look to the past.
---
&gt;Goonswarm, for the longest time, had a habit of bringing in-game issues into real life. They would find out tons of real-life information about people, and then use that information to threaten, harass, humiliate, or do worse, like try and get people fired from their jobs.
---
&gt;It wasn't that all goons were doing this, mind you, but the leadership of Goonswarm endorsed that stuff wholeheartedly and gave it their full backing. However, after World War Bee, Goonswarm lost Digi (who was sort of the face of all their doxxing activities), and after that, they've moved away from all that horseshit. At least far as any of us line members know.
---
.
---
&gt;the question in this thread was "what's the deal with goons" (though i guess it's fair to point out that goons didn't like, invent doxxing), but your newfag whataboutist whiteknighting all over this thread is cringey as fuck and moreover just as ignorant as the people you're trying to call out
---
&gt;between digi projects, sion projects, pre-2016 mittens and his egowar against CCP, and fedora tier line-crossing like trying to monetise the coalition membership to sell to other game studios as population influxes in other games, no, there was nothing else even close to "like-minded strategies" when it game to transgressing the boundaries between in-game and real life.
---
&gt;there were always people who took it too far but GSF(+pets) was the only group in this game who needed to constantly blur, cross, or ignore that line on an institutional level, given the core goals its leadership wanted to accomplish
---

Nope, join goons if that is all you want.
---
K-Y-R is still the best german corp in the game
---
they are, however, also still full of germans and thus mostly trash but sometimes an austrian takes control and we get to see something beautiful 
---
Does local not work again or something?
---
I know this may be a coincidence but I had a Talos scrammed (2points) yesterday and I was very close to him do no way it would turn off. He warped away like it was nothing. I ended up finding him and killing him and he didn't have any WCS on at all. I wonder if what happened to me happened to you. Game didn't recognize my scram as it was not in the logs either. It was the second time I caught him though. 
---
Who is voltron?
---
&gt; doesn’t care about pvp
---
Then goonswarm isn’t for you.
---
Legacy but without test 
---
Wasn’t Seddow, wish it was Seddow and thats not something you hear every day.
---
FC made numerous errors, and coupled with poor prep (no on grid tacs, bad scouting) we fed hard. 
---
Horde has one of the strictest recruitment requirements.
---
So it's legacy B-team.
---
I still don't get it. With Astero (55m) Sister's Core Probe Launcher (30m), 16x Sister's probes (roughly 5 m), you're only at 90 m. Maybe 10m for Cloak + T2 fit for exploration.
---
 Cos legacy is Voltron plus test.  It’s just two different groups 
---
That was fun to watch. I've done a similar thing in the recent crimson harvest event. With the webbing frigs in the first section. I warped a battleship there and 2 phantasms followed, the rats webbed them down below 100m/s, and torpedo's did their thing.
---
I'm assuming you have to have good/non-hostile Sansha/pirate standings for them to not aggro you?
---
and are within two standard deviations of chromosomes.
---
You can't just decide that someone should support something, then condemn them for not supporting it. It doesn't make any sense.
---
I think that if you dislike Elo, you should dislike BL as a whole. YOU DIDN'T SAY YOU DISLIKE BL AS A WHOLE REEEEEEEEEEE.
---
&gt;At this stage of the game, what is to stop a couple of the big alliances forming a "Super Alliance", wiping out everyone who opposes them, and therefore basically "winning" eve in so far as eliminating all null sec opposition and monopolizing certain key areas of the economy?
---
That's already happened.
---
Meh. Never mentioned something about a conspiracy or NDA so no Grr Olmec please.
---
You did not relocate inhabitants of the other 2 regions you locust. You just made deals for moons.
---
Too bad dreadbombs don't work in 2019
---
You're thinking of Tiky Mikk. I'm just some irrelevant bad.
---
come to huola!
---
It's true. You have to check in with traffic control before you can even undock and join the undock queue while GSOL snapchat Mittens to find out where he specifically wants you to specifically go. And sometimes there will be a strat op just for the Elite PVP group and you get tossed into a holding pattern and have to jettison 1 round of ammo, which you never get back btw, and orbit the can in a specific direction. 
---
legacy without test is just test pets.
---
lowsec voltron best voltron.
---
The time capsule went to space, correct? 
---
A single volley of broadcast-inputs?? 
---
Cool story.
---
No way!
---
Yeah. 
---
2.5 Standings to be neutral to them
---
5.0 Standings to be blue to them (They will remote repair you with logistics)
---
35k being? Tapi?  Lol, they still under the delusion they a strong coalition that doesn’t need goons.
---
Rest of eve sees them as goons pet.
---
Can’t win vs a northern coalition without goons 
---
Sounds nice. I gave up on wormholes for site running way back because I kept getting killed by sleepers. Have fun watching out for me in the T3 I don't fly :) 
---
Interesting.. guess i found a use for my standings boosters then.
---
supers apply rly well to subcaps????
---
wtf u mean a superfleet can chain dunk subs?????? wow!
---
NC fights with Panfam at most.
---
Test fights with anyone who'll answer a batphone.
---
At this rate, we need a new term that goes past "Coalition". 
---
The Tapirium "Combine"?
---
Pick a corp you want to run lvl 4 missions for, find lvl 1/2 missions from agents of that same corp, and run those.
---
And if you train the skill that increases your effective standings, you can skip lvl 1 missions as soon as you get any change on the base standings.
---
blue donut vs blue donut
---
I lost my first Astero to some filthy unwashed hairy wardeccers who never locked me up as I warped to a Amarr EFA instant dock bookmark. As soon as I loaded grid the client DC'd and I come back in a pod wondering how someone shot and alpha'd me while I was still in warp. The 2nd one I bought also died the same way, this time in Jita. 
---
I don't know. If I got a free kill like that for nothing I'd feel bad, give the guy his stuffs and SRP it. 
---
Ascee is recruiting.
---
I often take bait to fight the response. Dying and fighting is better than nothing at all
---
lol they can't even beat a literal newbie alliance in t1 ships without resorting to titans 
---
tell me again why anyone thinks these edgelords are good? 
---
they have like 1k members why the hasn't someone taken out the trash and dumpstered their keepstar to teach them a lesson
---
Dreadbomb would do, either fleet of 20-30 frigates. Sotyo will spawn more npcs, which would add npc points to the grid. But common, no one is really doing it in titans right now, 2 supercarries, or a dozen of carriers risk nothing while staying out of sotyo activation range.
---
The entire southeast and southwest sees panfam/north as the bad guys, hence the mutual defense pact.
---
Maybe you should consider why that is.
---
&gt; The Connections skill gives you +0.4 to all positive standings per level
---
This is true while your base standing is near 0 (if it's 0, as in nothing ever increased or decreased it,no modifier applies). But it's actually 4% per lvl on the difference between your base standings and max standings. So if you get your base standings up to +5, each lvl of this skill will only add 0.2 at that point.
---
We find that your case has no merit and we invite you to resubmit if you obtain further evidence.
---
By The Way Fellow Autists, if you too would like to fail hard at welping a Nyx during late NATZ and then be wrecked at work the next day please apply.
---
&gt; Why does a takeover seem "drastic"?
---
Becuase you can just make a deal for moons.
---
&gt; conspiracy theory
---
Lol @ the amount of people mentioning a conspiracy when I didn't even say anything suggesting one. Alliances position themselves for upcoming changes all the time. Nothing wrong with that.

---
Thanks for your judgement
---
Yeah Standings boosters are a great way to improve your standings. BTW you can get neutral to Guristas or Angels with the Potency-75 just by running their epic arcs.  
---
Normally you get a 30% gain from the pirate epic arcs, but with potency-75 and Standings V you gain double standings (100%). This is the cap btw, using a potency-50 will not increase it further. This +60% boost will instantly take you from -10 to Angel/Guristas to +2.00. Then with level 2 criminal connections social skill which is a few hours train if you don't have it, it will push you over to +2.5 and get you neutral in an evening even if you were -10.  
---
Sansha is a little trickier, you can get +10% (+20%) from the easy lowsec part of the amarr epic arc. Since Guristas are allied to Sansha, it would probably be faster to just fix guristas standings with guri epic arc then spam level 4s from guristas to get derived standings. This will tank your empire faction standings though so could be undesirable unlike the epic arcs which do not.  
---
Blood Raiders is the hardest since no epic arc, and good luck with Delve. Better to run Guri/Sansha Derived Standings I imagine.  
---
Serpentis don't actually have any NPC miners so you don't need to worry about them.  
---
If you wanted access to all npc miners then Guri epic arc, amarr epic arc, grind guristas until you get derived standings to blood/sansha, then afterwards run angel epic arc (your angel standings will go down since they are hostile to blood/guri/sansha)

Negative.  As we speak strong independent minmil ~~bots~~ active pvpers are deplexing Roush after our inability to complete the bash lastnight.

&gt;Is there any reason for me not to join Goonswarm Federation?
---
Goonswarm, and most other large alliances require some pvp participation to allow you to stay in corp
---
There are no bigger overly relevant german alliances in this game.
---
However there are a few smaller german alliances, for example:
---
* GONE BEZERK (Small PvP alliance in Scalding Pass)
---
* Invidia Gloriae Comes (Renter alliance though)
---
* Destiny's Call (most people from Switzerland tho, so bad bad accent xD)
---
Also there are some alliances that have a significant amount ofgerman corps or players:
---
* Test Alliance Please Ignore
---
* The Initiative.
---
* Evictus. (I think majority are actually german, but they all speak english)
---
* RAZOR Alliance
---
* DRONE WALKERS (I think there are still some german groups in there, but not sure)
---
* Blades of Grass
---
* Combat Wombat.
---
There have been plenty of german or german dominated alliances that disbanded or merged  in the last 2 years or so, like LUMPY, inPanic, Das Fornax Protektorat, Spears of Destiny, Bergmann Federation, Raumwaffen Koalition, Cascade Imminent, Gemini Empire...
---
Germans don't tend to group up with themselves because like in RL we are the first nation nowadays to abandon any patriotism and our own language, pride and anything. We are whiney dogs, that love to be dominated, because politics are telling us since we lost world war and we oblige and take it even further. If you ever wear something with german colors you are obviously a nazi, cmon, everyone knows that... &gt;__&gt; To prevent being called nazis, we prevent ourselves from being successful and dominant and don't form any german collective.
---
Long story short:
---
The best chance at playing with germans is being in Southern Null. Legacy has the most german players of any coalition, although there are a few corps in Winter, and the Imperium also has some. Otherwise you would need to search hard. There are surely a lot I haven't listed here, but overall I think it holds true.

An indication was cleary there and when CCP looks at that situation or previous logs and does not take action, like it has apparently happened in your case, I'll respect that decision. Nothing stopping you from acting on your suspicion and reporting these Rorqs.
---
&gt; Hunting without using a ship/cargo scanner.
---
Going in blind (no scanner, no eyes on potential hostile stagings, not having someone in hostile comms, using single ship as tackle and cyno) was what caused it to die, but I wouldn't call it a mistake - it's just judgement call on how much risk is acceptable when dropping. Sure, piloting could've been better (you can always improve), but overall it looks more like bad luck and getting baited, not really a faildrop.
---
\&gt;  Becuase you can just make a deal for moons.

---
So what you are saying is... Legacy without TEST is called Voltron.

“Mutual defense pact”. Hence why goons has to come bail test out of a failed offense.

---
CCP severely nerfed force projection in case you didn't notice.  They literally introduced jump fatigue, etc.  It's been relaxed a little with the cap and the new jump gates but still.
---
Didn't people used to say the same about BOB?  Are they still top dog?  Things happen.  Maybe it will turn into the Chinese one.  That would be a shame, yes.  Ah well.
---
&gt; its free because we mined it
---
I mean you go on one of those ops, your fleet fails to jump through on a crit-mass wormhole and you get split, and the FC turns you around to go home. You still get a PAP link.
---
The amount of effort required isn't really anything huge.
---
P.S. Above is a genuine non-ironic example posted by a goon, no memeing.
---
You know there are German Groups in this Game, that are PVP oriented, without tryharding that, if you're not flairbaiting, you might even know one of them.
---
Kinda yeah.  Anyone who plays the game long enough will find themselves shooting at old allies eventually.  This is true for DnG most of all.  We've flown with TAPI, SGRN, CALSF, TBC, BL - all within the last 3 years. It's very rare that we engage fleets of people that we've never before called our allies.  Most people I think just appreciate that this is just the nature of the game but not so much for others I guess.

So a miner with apm of a top ranked SC2 player the second tackle lands on grid. Possible to pull it off with 6 accounts. But for 10+ it becomes quite unbelievable.

I know about those cropped mini-previews and people using window mode and keeping them behind each other, also boxing miners and a pvp/pve ship.. It has high potential of becoming a mess- activating random cyno, forgetting to do something on one of the accounts/ switching windows too fast etc.

I see goons taking a new area from one of their ally so it's CSM leak.

Taking shortcut is dumb, think, gather and build an idea around it, what you do is just spreading lie and we all know who "Olmeca" is, a grr-goons guy without fact.

Something about Eve seems to attract some ethnicities more than other: for one I've had trouble finding fellow italian eve players, but in my journey through new eden I met a FUCKTON of german guys, german corps and even german alliances. 
---
However I do recommend the OP to look for a german corp in an international alliance for a number of reasons, the main one being broader perspective (and TZ coverage!).
---
Their size draws a lot of attention to their space, meaning if you don't want to engross yourself in their culture you will likely awkwardly eat shit when you get tackled.  There are quieter places in space if you're determined not to interact with anyone, but if you are willing to interact with people to save your ships then they are close to as safe as it gets, and a perfectly reasonable choice.  And who knows, maybe you'll find some new friends? 
---
Rest in peace

They are high visibility in the cluster of high-sec systems that are populated by noobs and they are a threat to noobs in "PvE/Industrial Corp Please Join Us In Our Great Adventure We Will Get Our Own Raitaru One Day"
---
&gt; CCP severely nerfed force projection in case you didn't notice. They literally introduced jump fatigue, etc. It's been relaxed a little with the cap and the new jump gates but still.
---
If you had any idea on what you are talking about, you'd know that fatigue only nerfed people's ability to bring offensive capitals to others' farmgrounds more than the ability to defend one's own farmground.
---
If you had any idea about what you are talking about, you'd also know fatigue is irrelevant because subcaps are. The only way to outfatigue an umbrella was by blops fleets (but even that was nerfed by new gates), but they get obliterated by a few titans or supers anyway. The real issue with Delve is its immunity to dreadbombs. As long as dreadbombs don't work in Delve (and they don't, and that's because Delve has the largest supercap umbrella, which is why that gameplay is only accessible to Goons), those 15-boxers of Rorquals have 0 risk. You can't outfatigue people with dreads, so fatigue is already irrelevant.

As an Amarr FW pilot, it'd be great to see Caldari Militia bounce back up on their feet. As it stands, we're fighting both minmil and galmil at the same time right now, which makes things difficult.

Getting the drones in isn't the hard part. Neut hits system, you recall them all. With 10-15 accounts, I could still get them all pulled in within 3-4 seconds. It then takes time (even with proper set up) to move the set from rorqual to wetu. Maybe 1-2 seconds per client. Then it takes 5-10 seconds per client, if your hands aren't jittery, to remove the non-tank items and drop in your full tank (if you have it prepared in a container in the rorq). With 6 rorquals, it takes me about 10-15 seconds to have them all safed, not including the drone travel time. It takes another 1 minute or so to have tank on. That's part of what has stopped me from moving past 6. Getting hit one time by 150 VOLTA and almost dying (thanks Pando response fleet) a year+ ago and I had a real view of how fast it goes sideways. Hole opened in system and 150 dudes were on me within 15 seconds. I got the tank on 3/6. Drones safed in 4/6. It's MUCH easier to prepare when you are in a pipe and they are reported coming. All of the drones dying daily? AFK/Idiot basically. But it is hard to hate on them when they have neuts in system all day long hunting.

I thoroughly dislike CODE. and their approach, but also I appreciate their existence and I'd see it as EVE's true death knell the day they're prevented by CCP from doing their... thing. They're content, they make others content. Everybody needs their villains, and high sec miners could do with a boogeyman.

Have scanning cloaky alt and cloaked hyperspatial t1 battleship with smartbombs sit 300k off freighter in line from where the gankers come from. Use combat probes to give yourself a warp in. Insure battleship

If that was the case, when someone responded with nothing more than "Blue represents allies because of the standings system ... corp mates aren't even blue, they have a green icon."

Explaining how you misunderstood, your response wouldn't have been "omg I'm done asking everyone trolls me, everything everyone says and does is extremely hostile omg"
---
That's why this is happening. But ya I'm thumping my chest by pointing out that you're a giant pussy for whining when someone tried to help you, and then you attributing it to an entire area of space you extremely clearly do not understand and refuse to do anything but further your own misunderstanding. You're retarded and if you have any actual intent to learn or get better, start by rereading this thread and focusing on your responses as origin points for the "hostility".

So I actually wanted to look into your org - but your website is just an ESI login, with no indication of what it's for. Then when I used a random alt account to log into it - it asks for an email - again no indication of why. What's that all about?
---
We were outnumbered on Sunday. We are usually outnumbered against your coalition. Even when you have numbers you drop supers, but here is the thing. We don't care. It's completely fine. Outnumber us, drop supers on us, we don't care. Do it!
---
Thanks for the clarification Richard.
---
Or that NC and Horde combined fleets and still only hit around 220 members so changed plans.
---
^(grrrr goons though)
---
Try RAZOR they have alot of ze germans
---
&gt;I assume if you are docked while in a ship you aren't skilled for, you'll be back in your pod and ship in the hanger.
---
You'll still be in the ship, you won't be able to undock.
---
&gt;What happens if I log out in space in a ship I'm unskilled for?
---
You can still fly the ship, though you will lose all bonuses based on the skills for that ship.  For example, if it's +5% optimal per level of ship, you'll have no bonus.  Which means your ship is gonna really suck in terms of performance but you'll be able to get it somewhere you can dock and switch.
---
Also, any modules that require omega skills will be offline.  So if you're in a covops with a cloak fit, the cloak will go offline but you'll still be able to fly the covops around.
---
Just what coalition do you think I'm part of?
---
Every good friend i made through the internet was german.  
---
Might be because of the mutual retardation.

Well happens if tapi cry’s for half of eve to help against horde lol

Νο.They bashed its shield and i think they reinforced it.But im not sure so can someone enlighten us? :P
---
Why the LRFB? the Short range do 4x the dps if raven dies quicker less comes through that cyno. 
---
the only time you drop/dropped supers on me/the corp im in is if we tackle your carebears. on top of that, my corp didnt move for the past ~2 years..
---
this is just the opinion of someone/the most uninvolved guys seeing how a coalition that already outnumbers the other group by quite a bit batphones even more.
---
but you do you i guess...
---
Spanish.
---
The word for street in spanish (calle) is pronounced “kayay”. Often in English, ai sounds like “ay” (not like ayy in ayy lmao, but like the end of “bye)

Thus, combine them, and you get “kayay”

Rev warped off in 40% shield 2 minutes before the supers started providing us with insurance money. More ppl (tackle) and "a bit" less boxing would help. Still, OP success.

Seriously though, we have much love to give you, great tender hugs. Also we need help taking these systems. Oh and something something exotic dancers on market. Ok yeah join us.

No clue, i thought this was a test vs horde thingy

---
Jesus, thats a lot of multiboxing. Hats off to multiple monitors.
---
its ok some people are just low energy
---
If we could add some of that money back in to lowsec, that would be great.
---
Hmmm not familiar. Are they russians?
---
&gt;Is there a Corps of dedicated anti-gankers or anti-griefers?   If not, why not? 
---
Game mechanics and human nature.
---
Once a bump/gank starts, there is little another player can do to stop it (assuming the aggressor is minimally competent).
---
About the only thing that could work would be to gank the gankers, but that's very difficult to keep going - ganking a bumping Mach is going to require far more ships than ganking a freighter.  Ganking a catalyst is doable, but killing one of dozens isn't going to have an effect.
---
So anti-ganking requires losing the vast majority of the time.  And it's difficult to keep people playing a game where they lose the vast majority of the time.  Which prevents a strong anti-ganking community from forming, which means they can't do any sort of large-scale operations that might tip the balance.
---
And even if we ignore the game mechanics angle, guard duty is extremely boring.  It's hard to get people to do extremely boring stuff in a video game for a long time.
---
Yes our application process could probably use a bit of polishing.  Unfortunately we're a pretty small group and while we do have a handfull of devs, they don't have a huge amount of time to polish it.
---
The ESI login is required for access to auth - while a header page would be nice to let nerds know what they're getting into, I don't find the ESI login to be inordinate.  ESI checks are pretty standard in applications to pvp entities I think. For the email you're right that a header page would again be informative - the email is so that we can send admitted applicants an invite to our slack server (via email). 
---
i dunno, my faith is pretty shaken that the damage was allowed to get to that level
---
Wow i was so hoping that dread would go down! Weird that he didnt have a grappler. Awesome tactic! How did spawn those npcs, did you shoot a mining npc? Did you drag them there with a fast frig or did they just warp there?

I attacked the NPC hauler when it spawned with my alt in a viator which then probes down the NPC hauler when it warps off with the defense fkeet and anchors an ESS on top of it, to keep it there.
---
Then you have an army of diamond NPCs and a warpable beacon to them 
---
I'm RonUSMC or Ron in game.
---
Well your leadership was pretty vocal about how you're all a bunch of battle hardened world beaters and then proceeded to try and underscore that point by attacking an entire coalition. I'm not sure what you, they or anyone else was expecting.
---
Brave still exist?

I thought they became a TEST newbie/training corp.

Thanks a lot! This was very informative.

Can you send that to me in game please? I'm RonUSMC in game. thanks.

Well, I am not German but I am learning German atm and the next step it seemed was to talk to Germans more often to get the 'feel of it', eve being my fav game and also being the social game it is, I thought why not. Plus, thought it would be really nice to know new people.
---
TunDragon may still be around. LowSec PvP German Speaking corp.
---
lol, I am not Ron Mexxico, but I think he's awesome. I am simply 'Ron'
---
Maybe if I had more than 3 alts : )
---
ah in that case sure go ahead. the listed corps in here are good calls
---
Spotify
---
So the defense fleet will stay there indefinitly as long as the ESS is there? And doesnt pew it? Is there a timer on how long they'd stay? 
---
What the optional amount of containers?
---
You can still pilot it, warp and take gates (so as to allow you to dock up somewhere), however you can't use any modules, even if you have the skills to use them as an alpha clone. This is how I've had it described to me at least, I have no first-hand experience. 
---
They stay for about 10-15 minutes before going back to mining, however, as long as something hostile happens, or they attack something it resets the timer, so I just decloak my viator 300km+ away every 8 mins or so, let them lock it, then warp to ping and cloak it again to reset their timer. 
---
Unfortunately, I'm not certain I can have direct support for Youtube, at least not in the same way as I support Foobar and Spotify. The reason for this is that Youtube is not a traditional music player. Right now EJR just works by showing you a list of playlists you've already setup in your music player of choice. EJR itself does not manage playlists and does not play audio. I don't know how possible it is to control Youtube this way.
---
If you're on Windows, https://fy.3dyd.com/home/ is a plugin for Foobar that lets you listen to Youtube videos, and I'm guessing other MP3/Media players like VLC, Rhythmbox, etc can do something similar. I know it's not ideal if you're not already a user of those programs :(
---
Some of my corpmates also use Youtube directly for music, so I do intend to figure out a way, but for the initial release I don't think it will happen. I'm still researching it though.

Esoteria isn't that full.  There's some systems that regularly get dogpiled due to their convenient location, but there's still plenty of empty systems.

What did you change on your overview/bracket setting to change color, size and bolding of distance? Everything ive read only lets you change everything else.
---
Some of you might have expected a tough run, the tone from the top suggested otherwise though, given initial bravado and then the huge climbdown just a few days into what was re branded as an "invasion" in early January. 
---
That was more like walking in spaceships
---
Oh wow - I haven't used FooBar in forever,  I remember liking it.  Doesn't it have a small resource footprint? 
---
Dotlan numbers muddy the waters. The number of heartbeats is what really matters.
---
You don't think the largest Alliance in the game has to deal with awoxers? As an avowed awoxer myself, I'll tell you straight up that awoxing an "embryonic" corp or alliance is a huge waste of my time when I can get 10 times the tears with 1/10 the effort by going after large established groups (Horde). 
---
What I blame is piss poor leadership that continually fails to adapt, can not remain focused, and is poorly structured organizationally. Almost every other alliance and coalition in the game has a rigidly centralized hierarchy, with almost complete power concentrated into a handful of leaders at most. Goons on the other hand learned a very valuable lesson 9 years ago about having 1 person hold all the keys to the kingdom, and have ever since had a very decentralized, flat hierarchy. 
---
You do realize that we were evicted from our space, and the only assets we had to our name was whatever random hangar junk we could throw into a jump freighter. We moved to the other side of the map, kicked out the current tenants, and rebuilt our empire, all while still under a constant threat of invasion and extinction. And this was like the third time we've done that in our history. Meanwhile, every other entity in the game was flush with casino cash, had an entire half of the map to divide amongst the victors, and were ostensibly all allied and had almost zero existential threats to contend with. And yet somehow, that was still not enough of a power disparity to keep them from sucking and imploding one after another. But please, tell me how Goons should be nicer to all of the people who dogpiled on us or the various traitors who turned on us.
---
Brave for instance doesn't

this seems a gross exaggeration, 2000ms roundtrip per action seems inaccurate.  if not, please explain

---
It was a massacre. Loved every second of it.
---
Make bpcs for any special mods and just drop the accelerators, without them just dropping an event just aint really worth it to me \o/
---
Would rather have all this effort put into improving / adding content that stays in the game.
---
Knew quite a bit beforehand, I didn't know about the internal timer but after the rats Warp off from your ESS a few times you learn how to keep them there :) 
---
Cool, I'll keep going - just would be nice to know more about you boo, before I give you my deets.

You, probably more than anyone over there, understands that the northern stuff is just filler until March for TEST. I hope your guys are enjoying the fights as well.

10+ years back it was easier to find nice german corp. I started my career in Gemeinschaft Interstellar Söldner back in 2009, doing merc work, antipiracy, first from highsec, then from lowsec, later as renters in null, then joined bigger merc entity Noir, then lived first time in providence when it was cleared of CVA by AAA, then joined EV0KE, our CEO got a big FC beside the other two main FCs back then, again living in providence. Everything with just one corp.

Why “Apolitical” Eve Players are Even More Dangerous Than Conservative Eve Players (excerpt from Buzzfeed Politics ^^opinion ^^column News):
---
With today’s non inclusive and bigoted elitist majority leaders in power, a strong independent miner I know has correctly referred to residing in New Eden as “literally unplayable.” I pondered xe’s thundering statement and reflected on how oppressed one must feel to simply want to mine any area of space you like, without its “sovereign owners (read: hate mongers) intervening. They are harassed, herded into specified mining systems, and systematically destroyed. 
---
However, a new apolitical (or should I say apathetic) trend has been noticed among some pilots. These closet thought criminals will spout things like, “I don’t care about politics I just want to play the game,” or, “I just want to come home from a hard days work and chill.”
---
Wow, check your privilege. The only thing worse than at least acknowledging and spiting true justice, is ignoring that the struggle even exists. You’re perfectly content to live in a world of hate, without regard to the need of inclusiveness. You’re doing more damage by feeding into the corrupt and biased system than those that are attempting to pull the strings.

Outnumbered 625 to 465, yes that's a sizeable 1/3 numbers advantage so you're technically correct.
---
The solution, as always with TEST, is to bark at papa goon to bring out the entirety of their kennel turning it into 1:3, but only so they can witness and learn from the battle hardened TEST veterans of course.
---
My thoughts were that it was just a front to continue high sec operations without having to actually stage in high sec.
---
The streamer you saw was trying to squeeze out every ounce of performance at the expense of convenience, because in closely matched PvP the first person to run out of capacitor will usually lose. For this you'd usually use one standard container of the largest size that your cargohold will accommodate while still leaving room bit of room for ammo and shuffling. You can shift-drag the container from the cargo bay into its own mini window.
---
A quick search suggests that Amazon Unlimited can not be remotely controlled at this time, so that's out for now, sorry.
---
VLC though is more than doable. What's a bit annoying is that you'd have to start VLC with specific command line arguments to enable remote control but being easy is not the EVE way.

Glad you're having fun. You'll learn plenty more as you continue to lose ships. The first step is to train into a covert ops cloak for your astero so that you can warp while cloaked :D.

I just picked up the game and honestly all I want to be is a space trucker. I just want to haul goods like a trucking sim. Are there any other space truckers out there that can show me the way of the trucker.
---
Sleeper sites in wh space = guarded
---
pirate sites in wh space = not guarded. 
---
&gt;Rest of eve sees them as goons pet.
---
Well, a good chunk of Eve see horde as NC/PL pets, so something something glass houses.
---
And let's set the narrative aside and be realistic.  There isn't an alliance in-game (except probably Goons) who could stand up to any of those top four or five alliances without some help.
---

You're sad.

But well done, Suitonia. Very nice 6D chess there.

---
Ron, neutral bystander here.  Think you need some more pratice on how you change the narrative (attacking Germinate for fun, its an invasion, now it is filler), suggest taking a few pointers from Mittens as he is a master of it.  Props to PH and NC for reffing a keepstar in hisec whilst fighting Test.  
---
Bullshit
---
Dropping a dread and titan on a single player pretty much sums up eve PVP these days, but this was hysterical.
---
So sorry for your loss.  o7
---
Well we are part of their coalition, unlike test and imperium. So pet isn’t wrong.  
---
But it differs from test as test isn’t in goons coalition 
---
If you run multiple clients with diff settings - make sure each account linked in the launcher has its own UI profile.  Not sure if that's what the issue is - but it helped me sort a few issues I had with multiboxing. 
---
mwd will apply speed bonus until it stops cycling. the mwd still "works" while scramd, you just can't activate it again while the scam's on.
---
this is something we do all the time in FW, in a slicer or other kitey boi you can slide in, overheat your mwd and burn as far as possible in the one cycle you get. if you're fast enough you can get out of scram range by the time the cycle ends and you can turn it on again.
---
G  ?   :)
---
So just to clarify, horde batphoning half of eve to help is Aok in your book, but when Test dies it it’s the greatest evil ever perpetrated?
---
I’m perfectly happy to do a 1v1 Mano a mano Test vs Horde no allies no batphones no nothing. Unfortunately Horde leadership is not willing to do that, and feels the need to batphoning constantly. 
---
Reddit does not care who is right. Goon and pets are the majority thus all their comments get upvoted and yours will be downvoted. their truth will prevail over yours.
---
If you know of any botters in Test let me know and I will deal with them.
---
Eve is predominately do do do do. Shit checks out.
---
Ok, then.
---
Subce I've actually been in most fights up north lately, I know you're full of shit. You have a few less than us until Goons, Snuff and/or Init show up. If Legacy fully deploys, Kendarr and his boys would be plenty enough to outnumber us.
---
But that's ok, dinobrains are gonna dinobrain.
---
:holding back tears:
---
Th-thank you!!!!
---
Some say he's still quietly doxxing people in the background to this day.
---
This whole "mah coalition" narrative is the most shit part of your narrative.
---
1) who gives a fuck about coalitions. It's just standings. It's meaningless.
---
2) when it comes to shooting you, you best believe we're a coalition.
---
So I guess in a way, you're right. You're not panfam pets, you're worse. You're a meatshield.
---
It’s still renters, we’re not expanding.
---
We don’t need space, we haven’t reached anywhere near full Eso utilization. This is just a renter reorganization so we can directly run it.
---
Winamp forever
---
to be fair my comments are steady between -1 and +2.  so i'd say the truth is fairly on point.
---
I'm curious to know what "nobrains" you're referring to.
---
Some say, if you say "digital ebola" into a mirror 3 times, he kicks you from goons for living in the same province as Elo Knight.
---
By your command
---
1.  well apparently test cares as they go "oh we had to fight your entire coalition vs just our test alliance"   while ignoring that brave isn't in their alliance, its in their coalition.
---
and then htey get all defensive when NC and PL show up to fights vs Horde. when its coalition vs coalition.   not alliance vs alliance.
---
if you want jsut horde as an alliance, then just bring test. no brave or other coalition members.
---
2. a blue ball coalition.  news flash, a gate camp vs goons is more content in the brawl that develops from it.   than an actual week long war vs you.
---
not even joking, that gate camp lasted 4 hours and had more fighting than your less than a week invasion.
---
and that was just the first one. ended up with 3 more gate camps on the same gate, all with brawls that occured as a result
---
CCPls revert moon mining for lowsec

Weren't you cloaked?

yeah, heavy scrams apply extra scram points and rorqs can be used as huge hics in this manner to pin down a super. a hic can be neuted, jammed, or just killed but getting a rorq off your back is a big undertaking.

I've done hundreds of sleeper sites as well but only saw the smokescreen once. I think it may drop in any of the three sites, as each has a small chance of dropping storyline BPCs.

if you think a loki would wait around cloaked in a relic site for a explo frig to come by your tripping. any competent t3c pilot knows you will never catch an explo frig who is paying any attention at all. there is however an exception to every rule.

---
German alliances are honestly not worth the drama. I dunno why but Germans love it and after a few months eventually years all German alliances fall into drama and disband leaving a lot people saying „never again German only alliance“.
---
German Corps tho. Quite a lot, depending on what you wish to do. But have a look into evewho and dotlan first and look at the leave history. Maybe ask some why they left.
---
Comment on my Corp was before I joined: like a bad wine, youngest drunk but it tastes bad. I wanted to get drunk, it worked and the taste was ok.
---
Thanks. It's something I've wanted for a while now. I actually like EVE's ingame music but I've been playing EVE since the beginning so it'll be nice to have something different that is still context sensitive so I can still have dark scary music in null and bright happy music in high.
---
And it wasn't very challenging to work with ESI. I don't know what life was like before ESI (but it seemed confusing, CREST for somethings, other APIs for other things), but ESI itself is very straight forward and decently documented. The fact that there is no rate limiting and instead relies almost entirely on cache makes it even easier to work with.
---
I did write my own ESI client since I only wanted a very small subset of its features, but there seems to be plenty of ESI libs for various languages out there.
---
I just hope that one day, they make a player's current fitting available through ESI. The possibilities for custom control surfaces would be huge. Check out this OLED button for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcjDcHIrACA
---
That's how I made my first big haul too.   Nothing as good as this guys, mine was about 20bil worth of moon goo and random crap.    Still pretty swanky cleanup still tho   :)

---
For sure, support for that "concept" will have to come later though, sorry.

---
Oh man. This is some quality fishing right here. What kind of bait do you usually use? I tend to use Salmon eggs.
---
GJ, Great video, much applause. 
---
I suppose only individuals than enjoy using them under supercapital and fax umbrellas are the only ones that truly "belong" in them, right? 
---
It's basically as easy as it was before to move regular caps around, and SCAPs can still be anywhere in the galaxy in a few hours and ready to go after 5.
---
In fact, with the new jump bridges it's absurdly easy to move subcaps around in ways that were impossible previously, making the Sov umbrella even stronger.
---
But the difference is that was the entire point of your Oijanen deployment. It was to test a means of controlling escalations with carriers and dreads while under a hostile super umbrella. Don't bitch when you knew what you were getting into
---
Aw yeah. It's so nice having that ability to warp around cloaked 10/10 would recommend
---
An entire area :D
---
I always put one on Doomchinchilla so I can touch myself whenever he dies.
---
Go look at tests posts after their failed war. They repeatedly blamed horde for bringing its coalition against their lone alliance, ignoring half their forces were from outside the alliance but in the coalition 
---
I haven't been playing much recently.
---
What is your vagina all sandy about this time?
---
Haha well posted. Not related at all I'm sure.
---
PL is the Horde newbro alliance now.
---
That still doesn't make sense.
---
Maybe try typing slower.

Yeah, its literally a Spotify in your browser. Can be controlled from your phone too, so you don't have to tab back and forth

There are assholes amongst assholes.

Nice try Tikk Tokk Toxik
---
We are Dirt 'n' Glitter.
---
We are historically a faction warfare corp operating under the alliance Local is Primary [CTRLV].
---
We are a small but tight-knit group of lowsec pvpers primarily interested in having fun in eve online through pvp.  We've been part of many major alliances over the last few years, but typically find the most enjoyment doing smaller scale pvp around bleak lands or black rise. Most of our fleets involve between 5 and 15 living breathing people and we emphasize the importance of fun over killboard efficiency. Most of our roams and plexing fleets are kitchen sink but we also appreciate the importance of adherence to doctrines when called for, in addition to the utility provided by dread and fax alts. 
---
We frown on people suggesting self harm.
---
Horde came to ref a keepstar. They ditched that idea and used NC supers to ref a fort. Meanwhile, they both fed hard for a shield timer.
---
Would have it would've
---
FITE ME AT THE SUN!
---
Shit loot as in , I stockpiled it and can't do shit with it but sell it in jita, sometimes... 5b in sleeper loot and I still can't build 1 meta six bpc.
---
typing slower wont help. typing on a phone here fighting the damned autocorrect. 
---
but looking at what i wrote, looks fine to me.  if you can't make sense of it go look at Test's posts a week or 2 back. 
---
We have a batphone that is half of eve?
---
having to agree with doom, what a time to be alive
---
Um. Nope. I tried reading it more carefully. Still seems like nonsense.
---
Have you met Panfam? The second largest supercap group in the game, and the reason Pandemic Horde has literally never experience hardship in eve? The whole reason Horde is riddled with bad practices is that they’ve never been properly evicted so they haven’t been put through any kind of crucible. Horde was literally made with a singular purpose, and that was to be the Panfam meatshield Brave was unwilling to be.
---
Sounds like a medium good site in provi
---
Why? 
---
Thanks bro.
---
I doubled with a friend once we both got an 11 can and a 14 can 250m in one site, I think only because we were both in it 
---
Isn't Blessed Beans some level above normal Horde, but below Horde Vanguard?
---
It's like "Good" "Better" "Best" Horde, kinda like shopping for a paint brush at Home Depot.
---
How can she blob!
---
Who the fuck is bitching?
---
Glorious 
---
I'll break it down for you friend, at least from my perspective none of this makes much sense..
---
TEST deploys to Horde's borders without the rest of Legacy. They talk about how they're doing this alone. TEST is pretty close to Horde in size as well, but from what I've seen and heard Horde is usually outformed.
---
When an enemy is sitting on your border, doesn't it makes sense to have the rest of your coalition respond to that? Only makes sense to me, and TEST was up to the challenge, going in alone.
---
Fast forward to the Keepstar being hit in highsec. I'd imagine it's a major asset for TEST / Legacy, so the rest of TEST's coalition forming up for that and declaring war on PanFam only makes sense. Then we see goons join in, even when Legacy outnumbers their opponents by a good bit. I didn't even bother to add all the alliances, so there's a bigger gap. How much of nullsec does the Imperium and Legacy consist of? So here we end up with two coalition on one side all of a sudden. Hmm..
---
Also, if we go back to TEST's deployment, it is a little strange to see that there's bluetral(?) goons from time to time in a bigger fleet, alongside TEST. During their independent deployment where PGL said they would have an advantage as they didn't have to coordinate with other FCs, but PanFam had to.
---
Had, let's say, Horde deployed to Brave's borders, of course they should expect other members from Legacy. Seeing as Horde is now a threat to one of it's members because of their deployment. Had Horde been batphoning others all the time becuase they're unable to do something themselves at that point, I'd say the same thing about them as well.
---
Hmmmmmm....
---
Kek
---
The high end exploration sites are sleeper caches and ghost sites (Covert Research Facility). But they're pretty rare, so you can't exactly target them, just opportunistically run them when you find one.
---
Only in the fact that Blessed Beans are API checked and normal horde isn't.
---
mutual defense? test needs goons to stay alive, goons doesn't need test
---
I like closing wormholes. It is my endgame right now. Exploring is just a side gig.
---
*Pandemic* Horde is an alliance that spawned from Brave, as PL's version of Brave, picking up the fairweather players after Catch 1.0. In later years, people joined *Pandemic* Horde as it was much easier to live under NC/PL's umbrella. 
---
The North has no one to blame except themselves. In the last five to six years, they created the South as it is today. Your leadership is raking in billions into their pockets, since the passive moon mining went away, leaving the line members to fend for themselves. Let's not pretend 'Horde' is all cute and innocent. 
---
So [HDZ](https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/corps:herrscher_der_zeit:start?redirect=1) in Test is a German Corp.
---
Southside Devil is a good dude, and a good FC.
---
Can you set that up so that it also has different graphics settings per client? Would make juggling different instances on multiple monitors a lot easier. 
---
Oh, I’m not saying Horde shouldn’t have batphoned, I’m saying it’s pure hypocrisy to shit on an alliance for batphoning after spending a whole conflict calling mommy and daddy to save Horde. We never batphoned goons or legacy until Horde started batphoning NCPL, at which point we called in limited subcap support from each, while Horde panicked and went straight to BRING ALL YOUR SUPERCAPS RIGHT NOW. It’s the best strategy for winning, but Horde very much does not have a moral high ground here because of it. If they didn’t want us to call in our allies, why would they call in theirs?
---
I feel like if you like mining - Goonswarm is the premier mining alliance in the game.
---
5 years ago, that would have not been something impressive to brag about, but Rorquals have changed things.
---
GSF is the best ratting (outside of WH) and mining alliance in Eve atm.
---
you should not join goonswarm federation if you're an anus
---
non-anus players are encouraged however
---
they failed to pay rent on time for over a month. no other story really
---
I figured as much. I'll just give it a shot tonight to make sure.
---
I don't do any device management with regards to spotify. I just send a play command with a playlist id, nothing more. I assume Spotify simply tells the last active client to start playing so I doubt the webapp is treated "specially" somehow and is just listed as a client just as the desktop app or mobile app. 
---
Thanks I didn't know about the profiles, not using the default profile fixed this!
---
Pls do share Legacy and Panfam numbers with us. 
---
AFK VNIs have been the way for poors to become slightly less poor in null for years.

But they're in the same Coalition and classify themselves as such so it doesn't matter, at least that's how reddit tells it to me

So its ok for HORDE to cry to NC to finally undock again, but when TNT sends HORDE a wardec you lose your minds?

lmfao that's pretty clever use of mechanics man! 
---
[http://coalitionsin.space/](http://coalitionsin.space/)
---
Rough numbers like: Legacy+allies is like 25%, Imperium+allies is 30%, while Panfam is 16%, 
---
Legacy alone is bigger than Panfam, and with Imperium its like 55% vs 16%.
---
"Bad People" probably refers to SkillU and Frat (probably some others that I'm forgetting right now.) 
---
Indeed you have
---
lmao wtf is that
---
are you dumb intentionally or is it just the dinobrain? Imperium+Legacy are half the null sec, Panfam is like 15%. 
---
Legacy alone is significantly bigger than Panfam. 
---
Main method is guristas burner missions. I use 5 characters, nets me about 1-1.5b per hour depending on how LP is. Currently it's in the shitter, hope it recovers soon.

---
I think he was talking about KWG. It's no secret those no name alliances on the fringes of space mine and rat and RMT till the end of days
---
Point is, Horde batphone still is significantly smaller than Legacy alone, let alone Imperium. 
---
You’re falling into the classic Dotlan numbers trap. The day goons actually form a 35000 man fleet will be a day to see. The numbers that actually matter in currentyear EVE are supercap counts, and then subcaps to a lesser extent. In this situation, it actually is about 50/50 still.
---
TAPI proud going 4:1, You could have gone 1.7:1 and still win it. 
---
I mean it was a drake. Not like that one guy who sploded his super or titan or whatever it was.. gf anyway
---
A) we didn’t call in either till Horde batphoned, b) are you seriously using dotlan member counts as an actual metric for the actual number of actives in a corp? Goons literally made this same mistake during WWB, and I shat on them constantly for doing so. They had a stat guy who was supposed to be Jesus but made basic mistakes just like this one. 
---

---
That's where you sat outside of point range and just warped, because sirens are dumb
---
Should you or should you not become a Nazi.. given their past, and their Leader, it wouldn't be so bad now, right???
---
But boat told me BB are elitist !111!!1111!!!!
---
&gt; If they didn’t want us to call in our allies, why would they call in theirs?
---
Didn't PGL even say that it was a solo deployment? I have heard people call this deployment a lot of things so I am not sure what I'm going to call it anymore. There was however a call to hit sov, etc. You're poking an entity's space, that also happens to be a part of a coalition. Wouldn't the other members of that coalition help out? TEST very well knew that would be the case, people have said so themselves, and then all of a sudden they are no longer going for that solo deployment that they were talking about. It's not like they were surprised by how this turned out.
---
Like I said, if whatever alliance solo deploys, like TEST did, to their space, you'd expect the other members of the defending coalition to help out as well, as it's in their best interest to do so.
---
Pls go ahead and share the active member count.
---
Pls do share the details of your 50/50 numbers. 
---
At first you’ll probably just have to haul your own stuff between trade hubs and exploit pricing differences for profits. Or dragging mission running or faction ward are supplies from trade hubs to systems with those activities near by. You’d be doing this in a t1 industrial though so the threat of suicide gank is extremely high so never carry more than like 50 million in the hold. 
---
Next up would be a t2 industrial or freighter. A freighter has a higher up front cost and more dangerous but can haul much more volume and less skill intensive. 
---
A t2 Indy holds much less and have more skill requirements to fly well but are very safe and can carry much higher value goods. 
---
When you have one of those you can either join a hauling corp like red frog or pushx. Or go at it independently by joining the “haulers channel” in game channel and picking up contracts there. Of course you can always continue to haul stuff for trading purposes but now do it in larger quantities and higher value amounts. 
---
The issue with hauling as a sole source of income if you’re going to be doing it for others is the capital required for covering collateral. In a freighter you’ll need 1.5 billion or so to cover collateral and in a t2 industrial you’ll need basically your entire risk tolerance worth of isk (5, 10, 20 billion) to cover collateral for those. And if you happen to die or take a scam contract by mistake you’ll lose all that collateral. 
---
And finally the last step would be a jump freighter. This is going to require a lot of skills, a shit ton of isk (jump freighters are expensive plus 10 billion+ for collateral) and a bunch of alts for cynos. You can do this independently and run couriers to NPC null sec and low sec or seed market hubs in NPC null and low sec. It’s risky though so the other option is joining a null alliance and running couriers for them. 
---
That’s pretty much the extend of hauling. I highly recommend not making it your only source of gameplay. Especially early on. Profits are very slow going with hauling. 
---
Amen
---
That would be too logical for CCP to do. You must be new.
---
upvoted lol
---
Again, I’m not saying they shouldn’t have batphoned. It certainly would’ve been a lot more fun for all concerned had they not, since our armor fleet is not on par with Horde’s super fleet, so it would’ve been pretty even, but if your goal is winning as fast as possible it is 100% the right thing to do. I’m saying don’t batphone and then turn around and immediately pretend that batphoning is literally the devil incarnate and how dare we, especially not when literally batphoning the NCPL supers yet again an hour ago.
---
I don't think Adversity is currently in Goonswarm Federation

There’s an awesome dude who collates zkill, those are the most accurate openly published numbers available.

9.6B vs 6.5B, 247 versus 506, I mean it's not that bad for either side I'd say.

It’s publicly available on zkillboard.

Also the guristas sites in the north. Sansha sites have intact armor plates which are the single most expesive item so your jackpots are bigger but thats the only valuable loot so it can be very rng heavy. I often can make 1b+ in a couple days, but last weekend i got incredibly unlucky and got only 4 IAPs over 30+ sites and ended with 200mil over 2 solid days of exploring. The guristas sites up north (venal and tenal) have enhanced ward consoles and something else which are #2 and 3 in value so on average you can make pretty much the same as down south and its more consistent because your not praying for just 1 type of salvage. Also the sites are alot less contested and you wont get brave and test pilots trying to gank your shit. Catch and stain are some of the busiest space ever. Actually i think providence is sansha too and thats supposedly neutral friendly null space so you might try that if youre not having luck in stain. Also make sure youre entering and exiting through wormholes as lowsec gates can be heavily camped. Look into Thera wormhole and eve-scout.com

No there is not I made the decision a short while ago from test to goons and it is MUCH better I enjoy being able rat/mine whenever I want and every once in awhile at my consent

Why do you even reply to a goon poster it's literally retarded to type more than 15 words at one
---
good, so why dont you back up your refutation...
---
Hmm.. looked at a bad BR then. But yeah, those FAX kills hurt.
---
That’s nice but you kinda have to link the killboard with it.

Almost every bigger alliance has at least one German corporation, you'd even find a lot of German people in higher positions in those alliances (I was talking about that with another guy, and we were joking how Germans usually keep the alliances running). Other than that, pure German alliances usually don't seem to fare well, there are some exceptions, however. They're unimportant most of the time or kill themselves off in the long run, with exceptions to be made. Usually the limited pool of pilots and the timezone prevents German alliances to be more than they could be. However there are some more famous German players, like Pandoralica (INIT. FC) or Killah Bee (NC. FC).
---
Also German players usually have very carebear-ish tendencies, so you won't find a lot of them actually accomplish anything in a "pure" composition.
---
sure, you're refuting, so  you present them. 
---
Your inertia still carries your speed forward yes, but your mwd doesn't keep running. Once the mwd is cut, your top speed goes to no mwd max speed and you can easily be at warp speed. Think of it like a reverse webbing trick.

Because 'cloud' isn't a magic word that makes everything better. Cloud service providers offer something like the self-hosted data centre experience for small businesses who don't need and can't afford a whole data centre, or who have very variable workload and want to be able to spin up or down instances.
---
That isn't true for CCP and Eve and a self-hosted data centre where they control everything is better and more controllable for them.
---
Should we tell him about ghost sites or nah?
---
I’ll do a full count for you since apparently looking at zkill is really tough in about 10 hours when I’m home from work.
---
yeah?
---
Do at coalition levels while you're at it. 
---
Zkill still doesnt reflect the wealth generation/krabbing and industry and alot more things, Horde always will tend to have higher numbers because of Geminate content. 
---
Total Dotlan numbers, ISK numbers from monthly eco report and zkill numbers, all of them together would give a decent picture, I believe you will agree. 
---
I think drama is just part of game anywhere now. best bet is to stay dumb and on sideline.
---
People take bait because it can be fun to fight, even if you know you're feeding into an obvious trap.
---
I know this because it's exactly what we did yesterday.
---
yulai federation is german I think
---
Can't drop supers in hisec
---
It's exactly this. Goons got buffed, not nerfed.
---
Maybe it’s just me, but I tend to be very choosy about what applications and websites I authorise my eve location data on. I know it’s against the EULA, but it’s just too prone to abuse and there’s no way to prove what else is being done with that location data.
---
Thanks for info. Whs are a bit annoying for me, i am more tilted towards low-sec or null-npc-pvp domain
---
Funnily enough in Southern france "Caille" is the present for the verb "Cailler" which is a slang for "Feeling cold" xP
---
Yeah
---
Perhaps also owning the highsec market for a year? Although I suppose that doesn’t benefit you that much when your directors are too busy embezzling...
---
* set the scene/story/setting, explain the fight before it starts or include context of some sort, this can make things a lot more interesting. a text box to explain things during the fight can be good too.
---
* good gameplay, I personally prefer smallgang/solo stuff against the odds
---
* editing that fits - speed up parts, skip ahead through boring parts, perhaps edit in battle reports/kills, perhaps have a little window to keep track of what your gang composition is or what you're fighting (can get fancy and include ship models or similar). editing has tons of options to get fancy and make things better.
---
* voice comms, perhaps included in parts through clever editing
---
* I think its a pretty safe bet to use pretty chill electronic music, tomalak (goat allu) generally has very [agreeable music in all his videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1Tls_P_bs4pgqLgOoNV6HQ/videos) 
---
* 1080p/60fps 
---
Makes it less impressive tbh. 
---
Any there is no video of this? 
---
Perfectly valid concern. Source is open: https://github.com/antice-eton/eve-jukebox-redux/tree/alpha if that makes any difference.

Not from my end no, unsure if shoot first were recording though - I'd love to have their perspective. 
---
\- prevent the blue doughnut which results from one entity being too powerful  
---
\- more good fights if more entities could match goon numbers  
---
I like Lasker Emanuel's videos, they're not the pinnacle of editing, but he definitely does things right. The narration just comes by blending in infocards, the music selection is usually something not too tense.
---
No problem. Yeah we had more pilots but we had nothing above a battlecruiser vs battleships and supers. I think we did good :P
---
EJR doesn't make any changes to your music player at all.
---
The workflow is:
---
1. pick a playlist from your music player
---
2. Pick rules (currently available criteria are: system security, region, system, docked, specific station) and should that criteria be met, EJR will tell your music player to play that playlist.
---
It has no support for editing/deleting/adding playlists or songs to playlists, nor does it control any other aspect of your music player other than play and stop. If you want, for example, shuffle mode or volume changes that's between you and your music player.
---
I agree   (except the choice in music,  that's probably pretty personal)
---
Alot of alliances have rules against including voice coms,   which sucks.    Actually hearing people really makes a big difference,   even if it's just clever editing and comes and goes (muting out sensitive / opsec stuff)    really helps make it feel more personal
---
Anyone could have told CCP that jump bridges with 0 fatigue wasn't a good idea. Not sure what the CSM is up to.
---
I asked a question, I'll take that reply as a yes.
---
If I ever had some sort of unlikely falling out with the Imperium, I would immediately apply to Brave
---
This is my question. Why the self destruct in the first place?
---
I've been wondering the same... people like to hear comms or commentary.
---
Alot of players are used to the slow gameplay so being able to break a fast fights down into slow and easy to understand parts helps, in my videos i also have a really hard camera inertia so it's harder on the eyes, but i can't play with the vanilla settings...
---
Lussy has a great way of using slow-motion to make intense situations last longer, also some cinematic shots/close-ups seem to help alot to give it more of a sci-fi spaceship vibe instead of just zoomed out boxes.
---
Making cuts fit to music is also great, I'm still proud of the first minute in [Nano Leshaks fight Caps](https://youtu.be/huYEZ6ruYjU)
---
that legitimately describes like 90% of wow guilds regardless of language
---
Shit talk each other the whole time. Fuck around. Web or scram whore on their killmails. Laugh about it. The works.
---
Wait skillu fed vs feroxes? :/
---
that one fax kill hurt :P was a fun fight though
---
That includes all weapon system skills.
---
Yes, you can specialize in one ship and be even better in that same amount of time.
---
If you have 50m-70m SP, you are not piloting all the the vast majority of ships you have trained for.
---
get drunk
---
Comms. Gives a bit of context for what I'm seeing, and hearing people's reactions to stuff is usually a good time.
---
I don't as well, thats already 2 people out of the 12 real players in goons who don't bot, seems like the evidence is mounting.
---
Am I being trolled?  
---
at least 20% of PH is spys, literally no reqs to join. Simply apply and you will be accepted within minutes on most days.
---
Nothing, I hate watching eve on video or on stream. I find it slow paced and boring. I only watch videos to learn things. If I don’t learn anything at all in the first minutes I just close it.
---
ban em all ^^
---
I bookmarked the exit when I popped in... not sure what else you are referring to.
---
I don't think the North-West feels particularly friendly either.
---
No more crumb shots for you nerd.
---
Good!  Happy to help :-)
---
I have never done a gas site... can you do those with an Astero?
---
Yes,  that is exactly what those diff profiles manage/do
---
&gt;re you dumb intentionally or is it just the dinobrain? Imperium+Legacy are half the null sec, Panfam is like 15%.
---
I remember seeing 300 armor titans and 5 full fleets of supercarriers defending the onlining Goon keepstar in the north.  This was without the shield fleet.  
---
You're the one not paying attention while goons pump out dozens of titans/supercarriers a month.
---
No that was what i meant
---
Good on you
---
Because i always fucking forgot
---
I got a 205m module from a sansha hideaway. I know its not exploring but still it's awesome.
---
I am a robot 
---
&gt; It would be nice if these alliances actually have to spread out a little.
---
so people can go back to crying about 2 entities owning all of sov null with their big sprawling empires... you know, the very crying that caused the situation we have now where alliances are balled up tighter than a nun's cunt?
---
maybe T1 = 1 and T2 = 2 lol
---
There are no reasons to join any of the alliances or the corps.
---
I have started in PH, then switched to TEST, then moves to Darkness, then moved to INIT.
---
In PH I learned VNI spinning, in TEST I learned to do exploring / combat sites, in Darkness I learned that corps do not need people who participate a lot in fleets one month but not the other, in INIT I have learned medium/big fleet pvp. 
---
There is no reason to join init/goons. You can learn to spin VNI in Darness and get yourself kicked from TEST because of lack of participation. 
---
Most of alliances can offer you a similar stuff. In some fights are easier, in some are harder. I guess, it all depends on your personal goal. 
---
So, for the third time, there is no real reason to join goons. And for the first time, there is no real reason not to.
---
As Austrian I have to upventure this.

Also, the more variety the better, not 10 1v1 frig fights one after another, most won't finish watching that.
---
Find out what they need help with, go help them.  Find out what you need help with, ask their help! Throughout the activities you will find that you are building bonds. (This works IRL btw...)
---
I saw it coming a mile away.
---
I'm not really sure why you want a structure. Everything you want can be done from an NPC station, particularly in high sec.
---
If it's just to have a structure then take the cheapest option, an unfit raitaru.
---
/g/ is that way -&gt;
---
drone regions should go first
---
not even because they own it and we don't but because it's superfluous land that has spent a combined total of 4 seconds not being 100% rental space
---
Best ship for it would be a venture (for cheap fit) or one of the exploration frigates (basically a T2 venture)
---
Even the sites with no rats, have about a 20 minute window until they show up.
---
I love the trash music.

---
&gt; if you want jsut horde as an alliance, then just bring test. no brave or other coalition members.
---
You know we did that against GotG, right?  And you can guess what happened.  PL/NC supers dropped to save GotG when it was *just* TEST.
---
Inegrated?
---
No. I already [established here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9xxc8s/adaptive_anomaly_respawns_an_idea_that_would_fix/) that there is a middle ground.

This the most normie eve vid I've ever seen.

---
how times have changes haha
---
Salty, but why?
---
invite them to your yacht parties
---
Counter bump the freighter. That's the easiest way. If you can get the freighter moving in a warpable direction, you're good.
---
instead of clicking on the warp to button and appearing at the location I right click on the description and select warp to 20km off. That way you arrive cloaked, don't get decloaked and can see whats going on at the site. Also a good idea is to look up any sites you aren't sure. I learnt the same lesson you did. Oh look the name says its safe &lt;BOOM&gt;!
---
Horde isnt a coalition, panfam is, and that includes NC. The narrative here is that Tapi is actually The Tapirium and need big brother goons help to accomplish real tasks.
---
This is consistently works for me: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6oiqow/comment/dkhohmj?st=JRGT9J4W&amp;sh=5214c1bb
---
the only ones worth siphoning are the ones in C5 C6 as the gas is worth good isk.
---
Just stunning. A proper send-off by an amazing community. 
---
All I saw was TNT declare war on HORDE- Hardly evidence that "Goons" were actually gonna turn up. 
---
  First timer, it was HORDE and NC vs TEST.
---
  This timer it could have been HORDE/NC vs TEST/Goonswarm? If they had actually turned up on time.
---
  *The outrage!*
---
  So it WAS **panfam** vs TEST, the single alliance. Which was *totally fine*. Suddenly another alliance may have joined in- and the HORDE/NC shitposters lose their minds?
---
wait, how much hp do the wrecks have?
---
I’m sad to see another of our number fall :-(.
---
He never mentioned his toon’s name though... he believed in op sec.
---
If his family has access to his computer, you could learn that from him.
---
Fantastic job! Great flying, nice use of mechanics, beautiful video all in all.
---
On another note, if TAPI need a Rev, a FAX and a Titan to handle 1 Hookbill, it's no wonder how poorly they fared in Geminate and Perimeter.
---
Mad props to Suitonia, huge facepalm for TAPI.
---
Are you really comparing nc helping horde with , whole imperium and legacy declares war on horde because tapi can’t handle it themselfs? Are you really that stupid or did your leader wash your brain the same way it happens to Goonswarm ?
---
I've heard of you, I even got tod to join you when I was asking about ER, but wasn't interested too much^^. Didn't know you were german, just that you're european.
---
&gt;attacking Germinate for fun, its an invasion, now it is filler
---
Protip: When invading somewhere, we bring the shield supers.  "Invasion" was always an r/eve invention.
---
Also titan bridge out ahead. 
---
Ask them if a hot dog is a sandwhich or not.  Sit back and watch your corp fall apart
---
Goon comms are cancer. o7 to the boys who can sit in theta all day. The pap system is retarded, and the fact that Indy corps have different rules just for giving a negligible amount of isk is even worse. There are a lot of assholes in goonswarm. There are people who will sit 20 rorquals at a perch, wait for you to clear the ochre and then sit their rorqs on every spod, gneiss, arkonor, and crokite rock. They'll double or triple up if they need to, and they will just ignore anything not worth mining. The other day an r64 popped and there were 140 rorquals in that one belt.
---
On the plus side, there are some really nice people, people are always willing to help newbies out, and willing to bridge people to any system in range. My corpie got 8bill in donations from flying a scythe in a ferox fleet. Cute. SRP program is top notch, and there is no safer place to carebear in the game.
---
Because Dreddit is so very selective in recruiting.
---
Random Goon: "You people need to be more like Goons. Goons are fantastic, it's a great place to be, there's superb organisation and really fast spaceships and everyone has a titan, and it's also tough and forbidding and we are so incredibly battlehardened because we were chased here once a long time ago and it was frightening, but now also it's really fun and cool and I have lots of friends and everything, and ... and ..."
---
Rest of Eve: "Yawn."
---
nah
---
XSAUX
---
The only german corp i know that is not terrible
---
So Horde batphonef goons and test because I’m pretty sure thoses to entries have already 2/3 of the playerbase, so even if math and numbers aren’t an advantage of you , you should see that ph can’t batphone half of eve 
---
&gt;I'm neuting him hard

meanwhile 18km away with 8km range medium neuts.

It is indeed not a sandwich.

I believe that the alliance JUST A GAME have a lots of german in it.

The answer is yes

what is that one region that they added that's dogshit? remove that one

they should just delete half of nullsec imo

It was a KEY VICTORY of EPIC PROPORTION. Per zKillboard we came out 7B ahead in the ISK war and Roush is being deplexed as we speak.
---
Be in comms. Drink beer. Fly ships. Get blown up/blow people up. Repeat until laughter/beer overcomes flying ships and it turns to just getting blown up. Undock and roam in capitals. Die horribly. Laugh more.
---
&gt; whole imperium and legacy declares war on horde
---
  Do you think that every single alliance in Legacy, and every single alliance in Imperium had actually declared war- And were planning to turn up? You fellas were spooked. 
---
  And yes, 2 alliances vs 2 alliances is a fair fight- Especially when HORDE are known for massive numbers. 
---

Did YOU mine it or did your bot? Come correct.

I'm still not a pet. 
---
&gt;  The intent was to force him to fly across the entire region to collect these items?
---
It spams his asset window to the point of making his game unplayable unless he collects the items or trashes them or disposes of them in some way. 
---
All techniques for getting rid of the items are at least as much effort as selling him the items, so while I lost time nuking his asset window, he lost at least as much time fixing it. And I'm sure it was far more fun for me to mess with him than it was for him to clean up afterwards.
---
Hilariously he could have solved the problem by setting a minimum qty for his orders (which I was doing) but he didn't seem to figure that out. 
---

Shit post, deserves a shit answer :)

what is locust fleet
---
Take out fleets, find content, and most importantly mercilessly tease each other. You'll likely get buddy-buddy with someone sooner rather than later. And at the end of the day, you're all in the same corp/alliance, you're all buds.
---
Because you will immediately become fuckin terrible at posting.
---
So Pyfa has me at 104 m for the hull, sisters launcher, covert ops cloak, and 32 probes (I am maybe paranoid about running out of probes.)  So 99M if he's only carrying 2 loads.  It can't be that tough to fill out 20m in drones, mid slots, low slots, rig, and a mobile depot if it needs to change from relic to data analyzer based on the midslot layout.  
---
My total fit is 73 m with a core probe launcher II, but it has no combat ability and sub-4k ehp - run or die.
---
This is some serious use of mechanics to outplay LMAO
---
I miss them
---
Bad as in bad HORDE posters
---
Haha, nice aar. You missed the part where my brain ceased functioning and I used a shitty on grid frigate cyno for sub caps, it gets blapped and they all landed that Sun, further causing most of the guardians to get stuck in warp tunnels (bug) and feed 2x guard.
---
Good on dng and calmil for bringing it and to mikal for going big baller with the Nyx. Less well done to the minmil guy who bat phoned us and then didn't show up (cept Gucci, what a champ haw Phoenix).
---
Lol yeah because horde and Nc are as big as goons and tapi right ? 
---
Well even if only 5% of all the legacy and imperium player show up it pan fam will be outnumbered buy 5:1 .. come dude even a tapi member can’t be that stupid to think it’s anyways even numbers

Ive got a lot of friends here. That's all Im sayin.

---
Here's an example fit:
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/74846191/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74846191/)
---
Notice the mids. Each of those heavy scram applies 6 points of scram strength, so that's 36 points of scram at up 10km. Max skill Nyx has a 25 bonus to warp strength so this is enough to tackle a Nyx with 1 scram to spare.
---
And well, that thing took quite a while to die considering the number of dreads on field.
---
that's about the same percentage as Dreddit tbh
---
I don't see how CCP made it impossible Old alliances and coalitions need to lose that old mentality, and accept the new meta. Look at what Goons and TEST are doing that is successful, and apply it to their own organizations. It's the same in the business world. Companies that failed to get onboard with new means of marketing and retail, such as e-commerce, ended up losing their shirts, and some, like Sears, are barely hanging on even after bailouts. It's really simple, adapt, or die. EVE is a reflection of real life in that sense.
---
&gt; 1 well apparently test cares as they go "oh we had to fight your entire coalition vs just our test alliance" while ignoring that brave isn't in their alliance, its in their coalition.
---
  Imma gonna stop you right there sir- When have you seen BRAVE and other Legacy alliances in force around the Forge?
---
  Nuff said. 
---
I mostly just make fun of my corps fellow directors std problems.
---
At least they don't treat this spaceship MMO video game super-fuckin-serial like the stuck up fucks in PL/NC. 
---
Rest of EVE: Reshipping, brb.
---
Most Null entities have internal stores offering BPC packs for better prices that HS. Find someone selling the BPC's in Jita and look at their finish contracts, if there is a lot of movement then maybe go for it? 
---
If you're looking to just rat and mine, my suggestion is staying in highsec.
---
If you're not willing to contribute to pvp in a pvp alliance,why join one?
---
i actually lol'd irl 
---
Mine, hotdrop, welp, boson duck, battleproc, cyno proc on a 200bill at ship volunteer to boson blue frigs in staging. The usual.
---
I can't think of a reason!
---
That AFK, grinding for the sake of grinding, zero-goals-in-life playstyle is exactly the sort of thing Goons excel at! 
---
^^^^Wormholer ^^^^BTW
---
Meh, this was first rate content, very exciting and engaging.
---
there's no real reason to play eve.
---
Proper grammar really turns me on...
---
Foobar2000 it is
---
the correct answer is "it depends".
---
If the bun is still together, it is not a sandwich and is more of a wrap. If the bun has broken along the hinge, it instantly becomes a sandwich.
---
yea true maybe ships that can only be used in low/null arent good since I guess most people wont drag the copies from jita back to their home..
---
Their cruisers get dropped by titans?
---
But is it a taco?
---
It was cool the first time I found a ghost site. warped to it, 10 seconds later a formation of NPC battleships drop out of warp on top of me.
---
Keep telling the world that HORDE is a small, newbie alliance. Seeing the numbers in the first timer HORDE/NC had a tonne of ships on grid.
---
  And you're trying to say just having Goons *on grid* made you all run back to null? Assuming they were actually gonna turn up? 
---
I've actually never thought much about the disparity about what is required to shit off mwd vs what is required to warp in this context.  I'm pretty sure I double clicked the prop to align - so it shouldn't have been running at the time the initial scram was applied.  Without a recording though I'll never know for sure. All things being equal though this sounds entirely reasonable. It still doesn't explain why there was no indication of a scramble attempt in the combat logs.  Do scrams that are insufficient to halt warp still show up in combat log?  I need to test this I guess.
---
See, I  sort of agree with you and sort of dont.  I personally think a hotdog is a weird special case where intent matters.  Just because the hinge broke half way through eating it didnt change what im eating.  The best part about this is that there are people who think we are both full of shit and a lot of people think this question is definitely a hill worth dying on.  I love it
---
Get out.
---
Thanks man, and thanks for the fight.  I would have likely to take roush but a 50/50 dread / subcap brawl while pulling my hair out thinking my nyx was about to die was _much more stimulating_.  I failed to say this in the AAR (which i will now edit), but GF man. Was a hell of a night. 
---
Well, that's more elaborate than what I do. 
---
&gt; As for corps, many of the big alliances have German corps, and me and many other Germans enjoy the combination of German corp + international alliance.
---
Another perk of that setup is the opportunity to circlejerk about the deficiencies and inefficiency of the other corps in alliance without having to put up with the kind of micromanaging bastards that German alliance leaders typically turn into :sun:
---
I'll cherrypick the shit out of Stain though. I live the sites half finished, then come back and camp them in a Stratios. 
---
When in home pocket and I find a bad Caan, I just deliberately fail it twice. That way, it saves me time and no one has to get blue-fucked. 
---
Get back to us after 10 years, k thx.
---
Goons aren't a PVP alliance 
---
Finding C1-C3 gas sites from HS is easy, and will be better ISK than hi-sec ore if that’s what you’re doing, or figuring stuff out. Once your good at that you can dive deeper.
---
yeah i had fun in goons but they need to reduce the toxicity.
---
I laughted.
---
Nice insight there, I'm glad ur elitism allows u to have the immediate knowledge on everything. Maybe you think your fit is amazing but conversely you could also be as you put it "dumb" and your fit bad. 
---
If you want to disprove what I said please try but all ur showing with those 2 words is that your actually incapable to see others opinion and form a retort or at least have a basic understanding of what I was trying to convey. to be fair I wrote that late at night so it probably reads terrible but nevertheless, your response is somewhat expected since I know the group you like to hang with, and pretty much all of them are elitist and think they know everything . 
---
At least my opinion of you was validated by your simple 2 words. Thank you for that. 
---
Well, obviously once you've begun to eat it, everything changes. I wouldn't bother reclassifying it midway through a meal. But if the hinge breaks beforehand, and you use the broken bun, you've got meat (and condiments, likely) between two separate pieces of bread. I'm sorry, but that's a sandwich.

I actually think it's great. It creates more diversity for EVE. Getting many players out of null and into hisec, if only for a little while, and confronting hiseccers with the drama and brutalness that null can be. I think everybody wins from this.
---
I bought a venture and did it for a while. It takes like 45 or so minutes to fill the venture for a return of 118m (at the time). It was just so boring and of course you're at risk the whole time.
---
dammit
---
If they are Greek ask why they have a region that is names after their neighbouring country and that it's pretty rude (macedonia) 
---
This is actually really dope tbh, most creative way to get nice frags ive seen in a long time.
---
Why did the sansha succubus begin shooting you though?
---
Still a hotdog.  If i break the hinge to get two pieces of bread and put anything other than a hotdog weiner on it...that's a sandwhich
---
Thats cool. I can also add numbers.
---
Goons was a great choice for me, sounds pretty nice for you, I joined Ascendance a few months back. I pretty much live in a Rorqual, protection almost always allows. PVP opportunities are plentiful. 
---
Be sure to join the local standing fleets and get in voice comms wherever you go!
---
I would assume it should show up in the combat log as the attempt still shows for pointing stabbed ships for example 
---
It is profitable , if you research your market and target needed sectors.  But it is not a task to be done in hope of plexing your account everymonth. You'll loose your shirt over it. Personally I sell researched copies , and use the profits to buy /  research more Originals.  Its my hobby on it .

I'm saying that poem is cringeworthy, so is the person you replied to, and no amount of "hurr durr who are we to judge, think of the deceased, reee" appeal to emotion is gonna change that. If you want a fucking memorial poem that goddamn bad put some effort into making it not be abject shit. Jesus fucking christ.
---
TD you dumb bitch...
---
That’s what the Br looks like. By the N+1 was hard

But WoW has plenty world-level competitive German guilds. Germany represents very well in WoW. Which you certainly can't say for EVE.

Some of my stuff got asset safetied, got absolutely no idea what it is and the curiousity is gnawing at me. Is there anyway to see what's in it before the 5 days manual delivery button comes alive?
---
The mods made me stop 
---
Like any other Coalition does it any differently ? stop pretending like TEST is the only one guilty of picking up the batphone..
---
Fly safe o7 &lt;3
---
Ever heard of a proxy-war?
---
Wait... failed how? Nothing reinforced in Oij today?
---
True true, blueprints seem like a long game investment 
---
Is a bit disappointing.  Half of me didn’t expect us to go back but the other had hoped like hell we would.  Second time we’ve reffed shields and don’t go back.
---
LoL,, your cute
---
forge? i ment geminate. if we talking about forge thats a whole other theatre of operations
---
to be fair, at this point Horde is consuming PL.  the pet is slowly becoming the master.   in a few months, PL might be Horde's pet
---
your whore holes knownothing of this truth.
---
You got me. Excellent Shitpost. 
---
if I take two pieces of normal bread and put a hot dog between them, is that a sandwich?
---
as if delve is not full of ncpl-elites alts crabbing
---
you ever put pb&amp;j onto a hotdog bun? like leave the bun together and just put stuff in there and eat it?
---
If you slice up the weiner into strips to flatten it out probably..otherwise youd wrap a single piece around it and have a hotdog
---
MAD respe for dropping a NYX in  FW my friend, you are a hero in my books.
---
Then you just change your mac?
---
sounds like you dont want to taco bout it
---
I'm saying what if I don't slice the weiner, but still use two separate pieces. Granted, it's strange, but is it a sandwich?
---
Do something togheter. And talk about real life on the side it helps to Tell stories and listen to each other some People are lonely or don't have Mutch friends and they like having some People that also listen to you when you drop your Daily egg
---
Good job Test! No significant support from the Imperium, against PH and NC. super fleet in Oij. Remember haters saying Test can’t win without batphoning and blobbing? 
---
Awwhh cute.
---
Seriously though Welcome to EVE, hope you stay a while.
---
well you have a reddit account,,, so your in!
---
You pretty much won't turn a profit on a fully researched cap BPO unless you sell the BPO itself. I have a carrier BPO, think it cost like 1.1B to buy. Getting it to 9/18 is something like 2B. Could be less depending on location and structure but for simplicity sake we'll say 3B total cost. I can sell copies consistently for ~ 15m and it takes 7 days per run or 4 copies a month. Ignoring copy cost which is like 1m that's 60m income per month. 3B / 60m = 50 months before you make your money back. 
---
I dont think youd have a hotdog or a sandwhich at that point..just a logistical nightmare of bread to weiner ratio
---
"I just want to rat and maybe mine while watching Netflix or whatever after a long day. "
---
I heard farming simulator is going multiplayer 
---
You could make 14b a tick with 350 sieged rorquals each on a rock. Just an FYI. Easy money!
---
No I haven't. I actually don't like pb&amp;j though, which is weird because I love both ingredients separately...
---
Tbh with eve in late-game mode, and countless fully researched bpo’s out there churning bpc’s, I’d consider it one of the worst ROI’s in the game right now. Not zero, but there’s so much more profitable ways to use a couple hundred bil. 
---
But if you enjoy doing it, more power to you.  With careful market research you could do well
---
2cents,

---
Geminate? Well then that makes it even easier:
---
  BRAVE isn't deployed up north. TIKLE is busy fighting Provi. Other alliances aren't deployed.
---
  BRAVE may be in our coalition, but they aren't here. If that's a crudely made attempt to justify calling on other Panfam members, that's a pretty shit excuse. And HORDE have no right to whinge about any other alliance deploying up north in the future, considering the past few major fights have involved PL/NC titans jumping through HORDE cynos. HORDE love to talk about "good content" until you light that cyno. 
---
As a fellow enchanter I salute you good sir, have an update.
---
you forgot about Endgegner. (tapi)
---
What if I cut a piece of bread in half and put the hotdog between the two pieces?
---
I've got all the alts training up as we speak. It's mostly afk mining right? 
---
Why is Jita the defacto trade hub in the Eve galaxy?  What makes it so special?
---
Yup. Intel integrated graphics on lenovo workbooks. I used to dualbox eve on one though!
---
winning is winning.
---
as a non nullsec dweller...for the love of god rent a hotel and fuck each others brains out and then be done with it...its getting ridiculous!
---
actually its nc. they undocked
---
Rather pay tax to the caldari state than fund tapi
---
If your intention is a weiner sandwhich, then sure, why not.  You'd also probably have some mental health issues
---
What's the point of bumping miners?  Is it simply griefing?
---
\-5 or lower should be killed in highsec immediately should they not? Shouldn't using tether to avoid concord be considered an exploit? In line with, say this one? [https://www.eveonline.com/article/exploit-notification-delaying-concord-response](https://www.eveonline.com/article/exploit-notification-delaying-concord-response)
---
The amount of Pandemic Butthurt is glorious.
---
well your flair says "no value" so he probably assumed you were in PL
---
Training for a Prospect, and the ice one.
---
then what is the difference between a bun (a single piece of bread) that has been cut in two, and a normal piece of bread that has been cut in two? In my mind, if you have two pieces of bread, and place a weiner between them, you have a weiner sandwich, regardless of the origin of those breads.
---
&gt; Are you fuckin stoned?
---
Ironic 
---
I mean, if you like rats killing your drones. Sure.
---
Except it has connection to stain so not so much
---
Sorry that we didn't write in for your express approval of our operations before they took place, we will be sure to run it by you first next time.
---
You explicitly stated information got leaked from the CSM.
---
so for horde to defend their home batphoning is Ok, for test to defend their HS Keep batphoning is not OK .. looks like moving the borderlines wherever they suit you.
---
Guess Red is having enough of Test harassment so they moved out and Goons has to deal with the rest... 
---
there's a lot of groups, where you simply just need to ask them about their greatest national shames and make them answer for them.  
---
100% approve.
---
Suffer together.
---
Time to sort by controversial
---
Have you ever entosised an entire region's TCU's and iHubs? It's a PITA, even when the other side gives it up freely. 
---
Are you serious? You literally batphone 2/3 of the gsme.
---
Because you'd only use a slice of bread if you didn't have the bun(the already designed with a hinge bread). And if your intent is a hotdog, youd wrap a single slice around it, never cut a slice in half.  One is a makeshift hotdog because you ran outta buns the other is a weird weiner sandwhich made by a psychopath.  Intent matters, i stand by it
---
This was so much fun to watch. Had me laughing out loud when you started going after the Rev.
---
its the real eve, no fucking capitals, lmao
---
What the hell. That was two days ago!
---
I think I was thinking. Fucking me am I ever sick and tired of all the crab bear acceptance.
---
It used to be a shameful thing now it's so rampant that eve is now Farmville.
---
Do share these details.
---
They started reinforcing the fort we're using to stage out of, but then ran away when we undocked. Then they started bashing one of the three other backup forts for some reason, bringing in supers/titans to finish the job when we harassed them.
---
you'd need component bpos too and sell it as sets, but its a pain. Sell volume is mmmmm ok ish, but more traders would clog it. and sometimes is downright awfull.
---
That's a question. Obviously because no one would read the post.
---
"Everything is fine'.
---
Some sub-groups are better than others at this, across all of the big alliances.
---
That hit hard.

---
In some YT vids I've watched recently, I've noticed pods sit around on grid and no one engages them?
---
Is the hope to get pissed to reship quicker/don't shoot them to not allow them to reship quicker?
---
Don't join Goons if you (i) hate stable infrastructure (gates, citadels, trade networks, and a supercap umbrella while ratting), (ii) dislike having access to a colossal PvP bookmark database (safe spots, pings around gates and structures), (iii) hate having to choose from dozens of squads and SIGs who operate in all timezones and do literally every possible thing in the game, and finally (iv) if you hate isk and do not want access to one of the largest alliance markets in New Even.
---
I was the dread pilot. Was fun and completely confused by the tactic. I went in with the haw dread to kill the ess while also tanking the rats and possibly baiting an escalation. What better way to tackle stuff than with a structure that bubbles people. I want to be clear, I was never in danger of dying to the rats. I had no idea the Levi was coming in but I did tap in my bus buddy with his haw because the thing is retarted and I had no luck tracking the ares and hookbill until the gnosis landed a scram. Anyways, Gf had a blast. Don’t fuck with the Africanized diamond rats. 
---
Yep, did that with my first Sleeper Site too.

&gt; Anyone know what is happening there?

Just because you can hear it doesn't mean you are actually hearing it !
---
So if I am out of hotdog buns, so use a single slice of bread folded in half, then what?
---
Depends on your definition.
---
Burn Jita effectively brings down 4-4. You can still trade in-station, but undocking to move items or even trying to dock up and sell items is risky.

In Sweden they put mashed potatoes and shrimp creamy salad on top of a regular hotdag. I'd like to hear your views on this
---
There so little evidence it was sitting right in frr66e3g2hwowbd whatever fuck off
---
Dat wallet flash, man. Jealous.
---
Umm...no you haven't. 90% of the time I've fought test I've been outnumbered. The only times I haven't was with frt before test threatened their nip would be over and when we blobbed a particular rorq with supers.
---
place bounties on them so you know immediately when they die so you can link the kill and ping them in discord before they even get podded
---
I like pineapple on my pizza.  You guys can all go f yourselves.

A racoon struggles to pry the lid up on a dumpster, hungry and forlorn. He feels ever so tired today for it had no real place to sleep last night... just a hole on the side of somebody else's tree. But despite all of this he is proud for he isn't like those dumb pets he sees behind the glass windows. Those stupid things have food set out in dishes and clean water whenever they wish. What week little creatures they must be since they have a fluffy bed in a big warm house. "No, at least HE isn't some dirty pet," the racoon hisses as the dumpster lid closes trapping him within. 
---
Yes!

Your preferences have been forwarded to Internet Quality Control. Thank you for making your posting concerns known.

What if you cut the hot dog in half lengthwise and put a slice of bread between them?
---
If there's a hotdog weiner and it's in a bun then I'm not judgemental on toppings or condiments.  I say let your freak flag fly
---
LoL ... under a very large rock apparently
---
I'm down with it too
---
Current component prices are very close to copy costs for many BPO, and prices are still falling.
---
5 Years before we had more then just 2 serious Nullsec Blocs
---
That is partially correct. Make them slow boat in a pod out of bubbles and slowly wrap home to save their implants or make them sit out the duration so they take longer to return if they are going to. You stand to gain nothing but some killmails by killing pods so there. 
---
Secondly and maybe more importantly you can lose a big chunk of DPS to shooting pods in a fleet fight. 
---
You seem angry, friend. Look what Nursing PH made out of you !
---
Sunday you guys had more Ferox's than we had people, lol.
---
Carrier BPC are currently selling for 10m or less in most cases.
---
The market is flooded.
---
How is Eve on Linux anyhow?
---
BPC are great when your BPO are idle, and you have nothing better to do with your research slots.
---
Farm less. Go outside.
---
o/ cool video and good luck to your new brave corp.
---
&gt;level 4hagenissen666Northern Coalition.-1 points · 3 hours agoOk, then.Since I've actually been in most fights up north lately, I know you're full of shit. You have a few less than us until Goons, Snuff and/or Init show up. If Legacy fully deploys, Kendarr and his boys would be plenty enough to outnumber us.But that's ok, dinobrains are gonna dinobrain.
---
It's ok to blame others for your big failure after WWB. The spot where you are actually is a self made problem.
---
For stratops, use the quiet channels.
---
For standing fleet/general chat, use one of the empty sub-channels and pull your friends in there.
---
There are plenty opportunities for relaxed comms in horde.
---
In this scenario you are going to need to use a bait alt to bait them off their tether. But then what? Unless you have a few dudes with you, you aren't gonna kill but 1 or 2 before they warp off or kill you and your alt.
---
Infighting in the Siege green Blue Donut force? hmm...
---
6 profits.
---
I just like doing sites.  I don't care where they are, or how lame the loot is.
---
I don't explore for profit.  I explore for fun.
---
As a rule, that's the best way to play Eve:  do stuff you find fun.
---
Very central. 
---
Back in the days there were many Agents on this station, or 1 Jump out - so it was a kind of missionrunner hive i was told.
---
Allrdy having assets there and no incentive to move them ... well, never touch a running system.
---
Only with 3e party programs that can scan your assets from ESI. Evernus is one of them. 
---
Depends how well researched they are and where you're buying, still strengthens my point. Capital BPOs aren't worth it unless you sell the researched BPO
---
&gt;TEST telling #goons where to deploy. "TAPI ARE GOON PETS"

Playing other games outside of Eve with your Eve corp/alliance mates is pretty much a staple of most communities.

Do you know what proxy-war means?
---
RTSQ's video from last year is my all time favorite: https://youtu.be/PSNZX9gdLlM
---
An outstanding mix of fights at the controls, cinematic shots, tactical comms, funny comms, and big dunks. 
---
This is all rounded out with superb editting and music. In my opinion, a montage as good as any. 
---
Nice!
---
I always think white ships should be medical ships.  They are too clean looking ;)
---
Minmatar ships, now those look like they've been through the ringer of battle a few times, even when they are new ("... looks like an explosion in a girder factory.")
---
Yeah I'm aware of that, it was one fight. Every other hisec fight I've done, except the one with frt, I've been significantly outnumbered.
---
8bil in fax does sound more impressive than killing 2 ships.
---
It's almost like Shoot first and DnG aren't blue, and that the blue donut narrative only serves to justify your victim complex.
---
I have had similar issues. I thought it might be memory issues and had upgraded the raw amount of RAM on the computer. Thought it might be the video card memory, upgraded cards. Still occasionally seeing 1-2 clients disconnect. It's random which 1 or 2 it is, but when they drop- it is always the same 1 or 2 for the evening. I'm not sure myself.
---
ME:10 &amp; TE:20 are what I was referring to as selling at bargain-basement prices.
---
All my BPO are researched to that level.
---
FAX are particularly bad for sales, just behind carriers.
---
&gt;Using an "over 9000" meme in 2019
---
Yeah.   Lasker is good 
---
You're right. There's a mistake. "Heavily-armored" should have been hyphenated.
---
Haha, the mittani narrative is strong with this one.
---
Would've been neat if we'd have flipped the system first though, now we gotta plex it all over again.
---
tl;dr
---
I wanted to tell you, when I saw you Sunday in your Lach .. I put a single ECM drone on you. Not a flight, just a single one ... and I was laughing my ass off. Hope you got a kick out of it as well.
---
Not worried about that, already running a ridiculous setup for my system. And it wasn't one or two clients, it was all but one or two, if not all of them. Mumble is working fine and no issues with 7 DTD server.
---
its just an addition to manufacturing -- when you dont have to build a dread, you can sell bpcs, for example
---
I bet you graduated with a degree in "Business"
---
Dunk is a class act. Love this guy.
---
Plenty of people will. Look for the bpcs for sale. Look at me/te levels. Factor in the research time. Look at the contract history of people selling them and work out how many you'd need to sell to make a profit then add the time it'd take you to copy that many and sell them to the research time and compare it to [insert other money making excercise]. Consider the time and effort and decide for yourself if it's worth it. 
---
I used a VPN, then got a better ISP with more bandwidth.
---
You need to run 1 (one) level 1 mission, if you train Connections 3.
---
You can do level 2 missions in a destroyer, except for Mission of Mercy (unless you are insane, then yes, it is technically possible as I have done it in an artillery Thrasher).
---
Might be of use (has some general mission info):
---
/r/Eve/comments/aj2jl1/understanding_standings/eescguq/
---
Can someone in the Imperium share what the upcoming CCP change is?
---
Capital BPCs take about a week to sell (and about 9 days to copy). So if you need to sell 100 copies to break even, then you're looking to have that BPO grinding out for several years. I don't know about you, but I don't play a game to drudge over a keyboard every single day. 
---
The money is in offering a complete set of capital component bpcs to go with your Dread/Carrier/Fax/Rorq copy. 
---
I think 15,000HP now based upon the size. You may want to double check on Sisi first though, it's not something I've looked into at any stretch.
---
Yea, it's nothing else for me. It could be your bandwidth though? I run everything fine on 6 clients. If I pull up something on an internet page that has a video streaming it can rage kick one of the clients.
---
He made an announcement that he was stepping down/back some time ago, and aside from memes or historical references, that was the last time I heard anything about him. 
---
Mate I counted 50 ecm drones on me at one point. Was fucken drowning in cancer.
---
Jump before jump fatigue it was basically 2 super coalitions. The current system is good. Just need to adjust how thousands of people can live in 1 region. 
---
Highsec and wormhole space (at least to evict HK). Yeah it's a sad state of affairs.
---
You can literally see them scooping the drones at different ticks...
---
This dude was a bit slow if anything
---
That's the song of our logi! lol. You were still effective though and pretty tanky.
---
Don't think so, Google Fiber throughout is absurd. Averaging 100mbs up and down.
---
If you find out, let us all know. I still am of the belief it is client memory and until the 64 bit client is out.. we have to live with it.
---
o7... beautiful video man! This is why I love eve, the community is like no other.  
---
Sorry for your loss :(
---
Just a Game is a buncha Germans
---
Have *you* ever heard of a proxy war? You know, the kind of war where you use proxies, not like, fight them yourself.
---
typical spodbrain smh 
---
passive income sources in eve dont tend to last long if the only real input is ISK.
---
Init uses armor ravens! 
---
I'll keep an eye on it and post any updates. I'm not sure about the client memory aspect of it. Before the Input Broadcasting ban I regularly ran 30+ clients. Granted in memory optimized mode, but never had the mass DCs I've noticed over the last week.
---
Wrong, but at least there was more than a 2 words response this time ;). I do apologise though, I think I have been somewhat harsh to you, but mostly due to a lack of sleep more so than anything. 
---
I just fundamentally don't agree with the fitting and I have been told that this was fit according to what you have on yours, not saying it is, it's just what I've been told. You can definitely say I'm wrong here, cause it is not primary knowledge, more like tertiary at this point. 
---
"Hot dropping" a vni
---
Ok
---
Dumbarse
---
Because an awful player in an awful haw dread dropped himself and did zero applied damage to anything on field?
---
That'll learn em.
---
Where was this announced ?
---
Yeah I got primaried a couple times which was pretty rude tbh. Luckily logibros held me so I could whore on more ferox with my point.
---
On killrights yes. Only exception is when Concord is involved. 
---
&gt;You need experience flying a super to fly a super
---
&gt;You need to fly a super to get experience flying a super
---
Yes, you’re literally proving my point here. When PH, who already outnumbers us, given that it was just TEST up here, calls NCPL in to save them, causing even more outnumbering, we’re pretty naturally going to call in our allies as well. I’m fine with a 1v1, but once you call in allies, don’t be surprised when we do.
---
It got shields...what are u complaining about?
---
This is easily the best EvE video I have seen since I first started the game. That's nearly 5 years ago now.
---
Good job!

"Baiting an escalation" 
---
Watch out he might bring a destroyer next time!
---
God forbid her brings a cruiser and test has to redeploy the whole super fleet. 
---
I think its good for hi-seccers too.
---
If you miss all the nullsec local spam for a second there's a bunch of players who've never seen anything like this asking whats going on. 
---
&gt; Yeah I'm aware of that, it was one fight. Every other hisec fight I've done, except the one with frt, I've been significantly outnumbered.
---
I had 16 on my inty at one stage,  musta blapped about 12
---
Wait for the alliance tournament to come around. 
---
What would be a good way to put 50 bil to work?
---
the remains of lumpy, kyr, are now part of skillu
---
What space darkness is crammed into about 10 systems now rest of group no idea maybe they to spread out.
---
Applies to basically any leadership-person in EVE... ( Nah, not to you Deeps, you re an exception &lt;3 )
---
“On” is way more erotic than “about”. Good choice.
---
F Kinakka
---
Yeah, too bad diamond rats dont dread bomb. Could have gotten some dank ticks and crushed a solo hookbil.
---
It would be a proxy war if both sides hired hisec mercs to fight the war for them. This is just Panfam fighting Legacy, and maybe a bit of Imperium, in a new location 
---
Someone is looking at that useless collection of random data for real? o,O
---
Mate, you haven't been gone that long, I'm sure you'll be fine
---
Imagine 500+ rorquals strip mining moons in a region. That's pretty much what it is.
---
Buy a shit load of plex in six months and sit on it
---
Grrr Test ...  just doesn't have the same ring to it ..
---
People always said cap profiliation killed Eve, isn’t a war without any capitals at all the best way to bring smaller doctrines back?
---
Gigx wife ?
---
Deafen and Mute
---
what would you consider a good investment then?
---
CONCORD doesn't care, but faction police surround them at 40km unable to get a target lock.
---
Honestly, you shouldn’t really have expected one. I was hoping for it, but we decided to attack is as a way to force Test to commit, and a real assault would probably be coordinated in advance with all our allies, not started because a couple FCs didn’t want to get blueballed. 
---
The problem is with CCP, they refuse to admit/discover it for themselves.. but Eve is the ONLY online game that ever disconnects for me and it's at least 2-3 times every few hours of play. 
---
They are lying piles of Icelandic crap who don't dare own up to their own shitty systems.
---
We literally only brought Test to Oijanen originally. Even now, after Horde batphoned everything, we still don’t stage Legacy in Oijanen, they trek up from Catch. Everything you’re saying we should have done here to get an even fight, we did, and you still batphoned everything. We even did the same thing in MTO, and lo and behold, batphone everything.
---
Did you miss the multi dozen and multi hundred billion isk fights that have been happening fairly consistently over the last month or two? Despite Panfam’s best attempts to stop any kind of content from happening we’ve been cruising along.

I don’t know how well you can take care of yourself if you have to batphone NCPL for every fight when a single alliance with its secondary supers shows up and deploys up north. When the default response to any fight is ‘run to mommy’ instead of fighting, that’s basically the definition of being a dependent meatshield.

wait so does this mean you can be blue to rats inside of green sites in nullsec? As in they wouldn't shoot you if you ganking someone in the site? Also, just so I am clear, You put down the tag collector to be annoying and then the rats warped to the collector?

No, he’s literally exactly correct. Please point out which specific parts of his statement are wrong.

I like to bubble blue rorquals while they're afk then start yelling 'sabre' on coms after I've cloaked

We’re literally keeping Feyth as rental space, just changing the management structure. I love how you immediately jump to random conclusions without considering any of reality at all.

Boat reminds me of the scene from the Howard Stern movie Private Parts where, "You just want to hear what he'll say next."

Either market trading, or invest in someone that pays you say 3% for the duration (typically 6 months).

There are a few well-known major investors (Proton Power comes to mind first, but he's my besty).  Check the EVE-O [Market Discussions](https://forums.eveonline.com/c/marketplace/market-discussions) forum.

I once offered 7.5% monthly return for a smaller investment on my first offering (10b), and 5% monthly on the second (20b).  Smaller investments are a lot riskier for the investor, hence the higher and more frequent payouts.

That TAPI spaghetti SMH

The people who were behind that phase, and who benefited from it, are still in power. They just have enough rorquals now that they don’t really need to do any more of that stuff to maintain their status as the most powerful coalition in Eve

Why in 6 months?

Dopamine.  I used Foobar2000 forever but eventually began to like Dopamine better.
