Hey, anyone know what can clear a instrumental or vital gas site C5 solo probbaly a praxis but what kind of fit or EHP is needed ?
---
---
---
Take care mate. o7 It's been awesome having you around.
---
okay, thank you will keep that all in mind, the general consensus here seems to be that I need to at least train to T2 and pick my fights better.  Will get those supporting skills up to scratch as well though.

There is no hate here although realize that might be something you are familiar with.  If you don’t like being called out for your bullshit commentary you can’t just point the finger and call it hate.  It’s called criticism, if you can’t handle criticism then how is it you are so deft at dishing it out?

Ah thanks for the medium shield extender tip, thats a good one. I will keep away from high tech frigs in the future too.
---
I used to use Pro Synergy’s bag of loot program. That might be an option for you if they are still a thing.
---
That the point, you would have all your characters on one account but you still be able to log in as many characters you had plexed. So if you plexed 4 times you could log in any 4 characters simultaneously. I really wish I could find that interview where ccp fozzy talks about it, but basically you would still have all the same flexibility you do now just all on one account for easy management

Corp applications do, in fact, expire.  If I recall correctly, they last for 3 weeks.  But I am open to being corrected in the matter, I'm not logged in to look at how old the outstanding invites for my corp are.
---
You dont know how to read just like OP?
---
First glassing? Me too
---
I gotta get good. Will pay more attention to my targets, practice and wait until I can fit T2. Mostly seems like I just need to understand the meta a bit better, which is fair for any PvP game.
---
Not EVE themed. EVE. It has to tie into Eve.
---
See its simple, and this is what made Dust nearly successful. People hear stories about the Eve universe, about giant wars and epic backstabbing and cool corps and they want in. But they only have one way to participate and that's playing EVE which is really hard to do.
---
With Dust finally there was the promise you could kill space nerds and shape thr future of this galaxy etc without having to slog through the EVE client. You could sell out to EVE corps and scree them over in lowsec and coordinate orbital strikes. You were part of EVE but with a comfy FPS UI and control scheme.

Poor krabbies

Very cool post, thanks for sharing
---
Thanks dude. It was great being around you
---
So... he didn't register correctly?
---
Is that what you're saying?
---
You typed *all of that* to showcase how, when someone fails to submit forms properly, the forms don't get submitted? And act like it's somehow a personal affront to wormholers?
---
You should possibly read the post properly.
---
Literally the only pertinent portion of your post is "*he won’t share the details of his CCP communication with me*" and "*it seems that for whatever reason*".
---
Which suggests you know fuck-all.
---
/u/ccp_falcon 
---
So I have two possibilities. Either you guys are *actively* trying to harm the game. Or you guys need to invest in Carbon Monoxide detectors for the office.
---
These changes are a terrible idea and you know it.
---
Pretty much kills any actual "exploring" in exploration.  It's just "clicking" now.
---
You're suggesting you really didn't read any of it properly, or you just have problems processing the information contained. Either way, try again.
---
This is your best friend when it comes to PvE:

I have no experience dealing with C5 gas site, but I doubt a Praxis could do it. You have to deal with around 1800-2000dps + 60-70 GJ/s of neuts. The easiest skill-wise is probably a Raven with Auto-targeting cruise missiles at 400km+ (since they won't agress beyond 400km, search FOF Raven if you're interested). Apparently a Marauder with Bastion mode could also tank the dps, but you probably want to clear the C5 with multiple ships, including logi.
---
On one hand, you are an idiot for posting about a Horde ping as if it were true news or a superb spy action by yourself. And completely post a shit title, to tie it up with a nice ribbon. On the other hand, if other goons are as stupid, they’ll believe it and keep ratting with the local window closed.
---
I dunno if to upvote or downvote you.
---
That's exactly what I meant by cross world game play!  You could both play in the same universe through two different games. Player in one game could impact player in other game because you both played in the same universe. "eve themed" was perhaps poor choice of words. If only they released dust on PC huh?  Or even ps4....

&amp;#x200B;
---
Edit:    
---
Was in 1999, so 20 years ago..........Might have changed sice then tho :-)
---
That's un-fucking-believable. 
---
I'm a new player ([like *really* new](https://i.imgur.com/CWPAN02.png)) that has been almost exclusively doing exploration and I don't understand the point of this change. Why not just make a probe drone that can warp a system away and return a signature map of the area? Why not accept that some people are literal paste eaters and if they can't figure out how to leave their system then they're probably not very valuable to the game ecosystem as a whole? 
---
Just why? There are tons of other ways I can imagine changing exploration and *none* of them are this.
---
Well, let's break it down:
---
* 4 paragraphs about how wormholers have it tough.
---
* 2.5 paragraphs about how a candidate failed to register properly.
---
* 5 paragraphs about how life is unfair and how dare a company stick to the letter of a registration system.
---
So, the only pertinent part of your post are the two and change middle paragraphs about what, *you think*, actually happened. Because the person in question couldn't be bothered to post about it themselves, like a leader would have done.
---
issue is the automatisation and meta game around it imo, should be possible to extract the agency data into a third party tool, then you just combine it with near2 and bam, new wormholers in intel? 2 new sigs within 10j in the last 20min
---
Obviously, it's a bit tough to look at this with so much information relying on trusting a game of telephone, but it does seem kinda silly that the application process doesn't at least end with a confirmation e-mail.
---
* 4 paragraphs about how we've made a concentrated effort this year to get someone on
---
* 2.5 paragraphs about he did everything properly but due to CCP's system being bugged or incorrectly functioning, the submission never went through even though he got the confirmation page.
---
* 5 paragraphs about how CCP are doing a shit job with something they appear to be passionate about and should sort their shit so this doesn't happen to anyone else.
---
He didn't post for himself because he's a pleasant person and would rather not get into arguments with idiots like you who after apparently the third time reading **still** doesn't understand a word of what he read.
---
remember when you could probe other peoples probes and smartbomb them until they only have 5, they you could see them suffer for an hour on 99% sigs, good times
---
The only way you'll ever get casuals engaged with this game is if they're able to seriously compete with veterans. The idea of a new player coming in and trying to do whatever it is they're planning on doing alongside players that are sitting on billions of isk, exp farms to pay for their omega time, and years and years and years of skills will *always* be the main thing that stops new players from approaching the game. 
---
That and the fact that EVE has a shit reputation and is utterly fucking unwatchable, regardless of the activity, to a non-player.
---
If he can't post for himself and engage in arguments to support his claims, I sure as shit wouldn't want him representing me.
---
And feel free to specify where my misunderstanding lies, because I feel I've summed up your whining pretty plainly.
---
That's probably a reasonable request for the future.
---
hahahahhaha I never really took probing seriously back in that day so my skills were shit, so no, I don't remember this but that's halarious
---
Honestly I'd take an actual colour picker instead of 13 shades of red
---
You forgot the part where this is all what you think could have happened. It’s also very likely that the form was not submitted correctly and this whole argument is about nothing. Also something seems fishy to me that you needed 4 whole paragraphs about how much effort you put into this and then only 2.5 about the actual issue. Couldn’t you have just taken everything out except those 2.5 paragraphs and then at the end said “we have put a lot of effort into this and I am very disappointed” and accomplished the same thing?
---
Would you be bothered when you put a whole lot of effort into a campaign just to get a message from CCP saying 'yeah sorry the form submission must not have worked properly good luck next year'?
---
The ship of choice in wormholes atm is Triglavian ships. I would recommend being able to fly the Leshak or Drekavac. In the shield department the most popular ship is the Muninn.
---
I hadn't even considered the one skill tree I've near maxed is going down the toilet. 
---
Jesus fucking Christ.
---
Maybe. I felt a bit of background might be valuable for those who don't pay attention to how we've been handling the lack of wormhole candidates for a while. I probably could have cut it down, I just like being concise.
---
It's effectively been scrapped and the team is starting from scratch to create a not-generic-as-balls FPS game. That was the last we've heard of it.
---
https://www.ccpgames.com/projectnova
---
&gt;Now, after taking all this research and feedback into account, we see that the gameplay experience in its current form does not live up to our original vision and would not achieve our ambitious goals for this project. As a result, we will not be moving forward with the upcoming invite-only Alpha until further notice. 
---
It's still 'alive', but will just be a while before we hear anything from them.
---
Iam killed 4 officers. (Loot on 20 kkk isk)
---
Iam killed hundreds npc capitals, supers and titans. (drops factions bpc and loot, so many isks).
---
I have explored catch and died to Simple Farmers cloaky dictor camp, was totally my fault.
---
I'm bothered that you're buying that story at face value.
---
I haven't heard any other representatives mention this problem. I haven't seen any verification, screen caps or emails. I haven't heard CCP's official stance, if this guy even has the balls to publicly demand one.
---
All I hear is some whining from a lackey of a dude who either fucked something up or doesn't have enough gusto to yell farther up the chain, and let himself get shit on at the gatekeeper level.
---
Why are Triglavian ships so popular for WHs? A little more expensive than I'd like. 😕
---
That's all I needed. Here's hoping they're still on it. Cheers. Mate.

I agree with everything but the Muninn. I dont know a single Corp mate of mine that flys one on shield fleets
---
Buying the story? I basically interrogated the guy because my first thought was that he'd just forgotten something. But after playing with him for years I'm convinced that he wouldn't stand by the fact he didn't fuck something up if he had. I do know he spoke to a CCP employee about it (not which one, and for sure that it was CCP not a GM or anything)
---
The other thing is now, after browsing the eve forums, it appear he's not the only one with this issue which definitely presents some evidence that it's a system problem.
---
Man that fit is hilarious. ...also pretty clever. This is a great solo PvP video! Nobody would ever anticipate small blasters, and so no one would anticipate a 100MN AB either. Even if it happened to them just the other week, they won't anticipate it on the next Tornado either. I've never seen someone do this. Def my favorite post in a good while. o7
---
imagine holding up someone in wormhole society as a representative of wormholers
---
fuckin yikes lol
---
Imagine judging someone by their alliance
---
If there is actually such a hiccup (which I still don't buy outright), personally I hope they keep it in. Surmounting such obstacles by actually putting up a fight would be a good first test of any candidate I'd bother listening to.
---
As the person spoken of in the post, I don't believe I'm able to directly share/post communications with CCP. I don't know what kind of proof I could offer in that regard. I talked to the person at CCP in charge of doing the CSM applications and was more or less told "We're looking at how we can fix this and prevent it from happening next year."
---
That's interesting, I've flown with various groups and the Muninn seems to be the go to for shield fleets. The latest groups I've seen using them were Hard knocks and Hole Control.
---
Ibis. Everybody needs an ibis.
---
The have pretty low mass which is obviously great for wormholes and they are good at punching above their weight class.
---
&gt; "We're looking at how we can fix this and prevent it from happening next year."
---
That flies somewhat counter to what your cheerleader is posting.
---
And if you still want to fight the good fight, I suggest clawing your way up the chain at CCP.
---
This is basically an eve is dying post
---
Disappointed in CCP’s handling of this, and in the apparent loss of an option for WH CSM who had broad appeal across the spectrum, both high and low class.
---
I have had issues within the last 12 months where eveonline.com character creation via referral link has presenting apparent success but the referral has somehow not registered, and the account being instantiated as unreferred. Luckily I was able to spot this and create a support ticket within the hour and after engaging in productive dialogue with CCP customer support, create a paper trail where I would be able to contact them for the giving of appropriate referral rewards if and when they became appropriate. 
---
As in Mort’s case, part of the story was the often painfully present ‘logs show nothing’ combined with an inability to rectify the non-existent data and save the workaround rigmarole of bothering CCP staff. I would second the call for re-evaluation of error handling for eveonline.com’s webforms, as there are clearly broader issues, and it is concerning, come voting time, that ballots may not register as cast, despite the message displayed in the browser.
---
Hmm. Perhaps I'll start training up a Vedmak and then up to the Leshak.
---
Imagine living in a c4
---
MunMun'Fleet has basically usurped and replaced Sleip'Fleet. Almost every WH corp I know of has a MunMun doctrine, the ones that don't are still fielding Sleips.
---
Krabbing is endlessly accumulating isk without creating content. Ie: if every krabbing character spent a quarter as much time on pvp as they do pve, eve would be drowning in awesome worthwhile fights.
---
Any probing frigate to find yourself a better home system.
---
C3s have only a single K-Space static which severely limits their usefulness as a krab-hole as you can't just roll a J-Space static until you find a nice one packed with sites to roach.
---
I would suggest a C2 or C4 if you're new'ish to J-Space. A C2 with C5 and HS statics isn't a particularly valuable hole, so you shouldn't have too much trouble finding one.
---
On that note, if you have a HS static, stock up on Catalysts to gank Hulks when you roll into a 0.5 System. This is literally the only real use for a HS static imo.
---
We only support custom logos for alliances, not corps.  It's a somewhat manual process.
---
REMEMBER REACH
---
They're on to new and bigger stuff to be canceled at a later date.
---
Vedmaks are lame
---
Drek and shak are the only good ones imo
---
It was 10 dudes, nothing a top tier FC couldn't handle.
---
You need to repent!
---
You cant disclose ccp conversions due to eula nonsense bullshit
---
Well Wallymarts was there. So i understand the hesitation to engage.
---
Both are good. They're different ships with a different use. 
---
You can also do brawling shield comps, like tengus, lokis, claymores, nighthawks, drake navies, etc
---
I agree.
---
&gt;c2 with c5 and hs static
---
lmao good luck mate
---
I'm looking for advice on how to leave a corp to go to another one in the coalition on good terms?
---
Current objective:
---
Survive.
---
Lets just say that NC. is playing LASO and they can barely complete any mission on normal with less than double digit deaths.
---
I mean eve is dying just look at the numbers from the past years tard lmao
---
This is a terrible idea. Please don't do it CCP.
---
CCP don't give a shit about CSM, more news at 11.
---
Polarized reps? What are you on about? Only polarized items in existence are short range weapons.
---
it has nothing to do with the eve universe where everyone and everything connects with each other. it was just a way to get some instant pve/pvp in the game. that they removed suspect for 4/5 in hsec made it even more hilariously hideous
---
If you get kicked from your corp just for being young, then you got out of a bad corp early. If you get kicked for being a sperg lord that nobody likes being on comms with, that is different. Most people won't care if you are young though.
---
Solo pvp is a skilled players game. You will benefit greatly by joining a corp that roams in small numbers.
---
I started playing Eve around the same age. The only thing most of them were concerned about was my maturity (which never ended up being an issue).
---
Sadly, I haven’t been able to reconnect with any of those old players, though I should try again sometime.
---

---
Nope
---
Nobody knows, probably even 99.9% of CCP doesn't know.
---
Ehh, your personality is just insufferable. I'm sure you will find it more causing most of your frustrations if you actually thought about it.
---
The guy you're responding to is clearly only moderately human.  I dont think his IQ would actually be a number, just a string of symbols and possibly a letter or two.
---
Despite the other replies trying to claim so, fits are not okay.
---
You're trying to fit your ship too cheap, which costs you greatly even if you do find a fight you had a chance in on paper.
---
T1 drones, t1 ammo, t1 resist mods, each of those would cost you a "fair fight", combined, they are throwing away your fight before it even begins. And for the active tank, as a rule of thumb, in frigate fights only the ancillary repairers are worth using a slot on (small armor and medium shield) with their charges of course.
---
Most of your losses were bad match ups as well, and you won't put a dent in something like a hookbill, cause he will control the range, and your guns won't reach that far. But even the fights you had against other T1 frigs, you had no chance, cause of your poor selection of modules.
---
Same to be honest, and I don't even like Titans.
---
Have any from prior expansions? ^like ^^Apocrypha
---
I'm in The Mighty Beans  and I dont know anyone that uses Muninns when we fly shield fleets
---
Please kill the M-O cyno beacon so AVRSE doesn't lose any more JFs tia
---
This just in CCP can't be bothered to correct its mistakes without the threat of being headline news.
---
Yeah honestly the only reason i did any of this was that there was lots of talk about glassing the region, and it made me think of halo reach. I just had to make it.
---
Deal with it.
---
No, really, I'm not trying to be an asshole. We have a lot of assholes, but they are just a small portion of the playerbase. EVE has an amazing community that has helped a lot of people with social anxiety to overcome it.
---
Start slow, explore the game, ask for help or advice and most people will help you. When you realize what it is that you want to focus on look for a similar minded corp/alliance and join them.
---
You don't need to be talking on comms all the time, just listen to others until you feel ready; and if you decide to tell someone about your anxiety, most people will understand and try to make it easier for you.
---
The game is overwhelming, and it is essentialy a social game... but don't worry, and don't feel you need to rush into it. Just take your time and you'll be able to deal with you anxiety and enjoy it.
---
Good luck out there, fly safe and hope to see you in space (I'll probably try to kill you if I do, but don't take it personal).
---
Blockade Runner with probes
---
Yep, I always give 1v1s in Delve, problem is most goons have a murderboner for content and jump in dumb shit and ruin it. I can tolerate a passerby joining in on the action but when some shitlord ruins a fun little fight by dropping his personal super fleet it pisses me off.
---
Interesting thanks for the info.
---
Okay. Are you me? This is me in a nutshell.
---
You're gonna have to wait until Downtime tomorrow!
---
Small I-a Polarized Armor Regenerator - wasn't aware that isn't the same as the polarized guns they added them while I was away from game.
---
Kind of figured that's what the free 1m SP was for. To put into triglavian ships with the new release.
---
That's good. Whaling was so low risk, I'm glad that CCP is paying attention and making them actually try. Good luck getting through the boson hole camp, nano scum.
---
Best ship in the game.
---
What is glassing?
---
Well, I can't fit most T2 modules yet but will get on that as soon as I can. Will keep ancillary reps in mind from now on though. Will make sure to spend more though seems to be one of the main issues after picking my fights.
---
Didn't get it. Was on a hiatus from Eve when that whole thing went down. Fuck me, right?
---
Why are ***you*** writing this instead of the, you know, "open-minded, communicative candidate"? While I sympathize with his situation I think you need to take a break - asking him 5 times if he completed a form, wtf?
---
Hm yea, those are not polarized in that sense. It's just a module with unfortunate name that existed before polarized guns were a thing.
---
:CCP:
---
Even if you use tech 1 guns, use faction navy ammo. That's 15% increased damage in itself.
---
I see someone waving down there
---
That's a lot of effortpost for someone who knows full well that ccp doesn't give a shit about your opinion, mort or wormholers in general because none of us drive the bottom line. We could probably all agree to leave the game en-masse and they still wouldn't give a shit.
---
CCP had never done any "plex time discount"
---
It's either plex discount or game time discount
---
Oh yeah, and another thing that will cost you early on, is not knowing what you should be doing in any given matchup. Should you orbit this Atron at 500 or keep at range 7500, it makes the difference.

Guess is that he found a bug in pyfa.

Like I said, he's not the type to create conflict for the sake of it. I am, and since I pushed him to run for it in the first place and a technical error screwed him out of it (and he's the only wormhole candidate I am actually happy to put my votes into) I'm vaguely pissed off.
---
They ran a sale within the last year dropping 30 days of omega to 425 or 435 plex in the NES.  If you go through plex transaction market data you can probably find when it happened because the amount of plex trades spiked like hell.
---
They did do a sale in the NEX store where you could buy 1 month of game time for less than the normal 500 PLEX earlier this year.
---
That seemed to be a random decision to have that sale, I haven't seen it before so its hard to know when or if they will bring that back again.

I didn’t realise it was possible to bombard planets in eve. Is that how you get rid of peoples PI setups?

Why did you choose to be offended by them?

It is your own fault if you're upset.

It does. Or at least mine did

This would be great.

Sorry, the 'Glassing' is just in the context of the Halo universe as the images use Halo artwork as its base. the term Glassing is just being used in terms of killing everything in the systems.

Funnily enough Dust514 was going to link with EVE in a way that players in Dust514 could request orbital bombardments from players in EVE.

When I was active in Eve I had good experiences with both Eve Uni and RvB. Every game has assholes and Eve is no exception, but if you look around there are good, supportive groups of people to fly with.
---
This is a stupid change, and they know people will hate it. They just also know if they say "We'll monitor it to determine when changes might be necessary" people will live with it.
---
Well, that's good, as long as it tells you to expect one.
---
I have used mine. Have you?

Yeah, just found this out by asking in help chat. Was going to delete this post but I'll leave it up incase any newbie has the same question. Thanks for the help.

What? Abyssal content per design cannot be run or effectivized by a large group of people, and all the new Triglavian ships are best suited for small scale combat.
---
Was Wally banned or something?

This was an item added way back when they first introduced mutaplasmids - it seems like there was an idea to be able to salvage this stuff from abyssal modules, with some other function possible after doing so, but it never happened. Maybe they'll do something with it in the future.
---
Goodluck my dude. there are many opportunities to ask for help, too. You could probably DM anyone in this thread and they'd help you (that includes me btw)
---
I really liked the idea when it was all announced...never got to try it on either side though so not sure how well it worked (Lived in Null at the time and didn't have a PS3).
---
Lol says nope, posts fleet from two days ago
---
True, but the number on the sign is a unit of distance. not how many Jumps.
---
Oh look, a fake u/Olmeca_Gold account, did someone steal your excavators?
---
i approve of this message and/ or service.

Your effort is wasted here imo. Go run for csm and take it to the top; I bet you'd win
---
That's the only way to do a tornado vid =)
---
&gt;We are stashed in the same system we have been for months so when we unanchor the keepstar we can asset safety our super fleet
---
ftfy
---
The dscan fleet is obviously just escorts for our new supewearpon; The Maller.
---
I for one can't wait to abuse it. Imagine this:
---
1. Enter NS connection
---
1a. Sig pops up on nullbears' Agency, reported in Intel, people move to close it
---
2. Camp gates in said system, waiting for juicy rolling BS kills.
---
Null bears bring a fleet to try and clear out the gates? Bam, content.
---
Your obvious ships aren't very obvious. How about backup scanners, rolling battleships, rolling HICs, rolling yachts and a HD doctrine. And maybe a few HD caps.
---
Mine ran out yesterday. Gonna wait and see what happens before I use my plex to resub.
---
Damn near used my free 1m SP to finish off scanning skills. Dodged that one...maybe.

Goodbye PI

---
ccp are pretty shit but you know every year, plenty of candidates fail the background check and are rejected from the csm by ccp? just this year chori, andres, and im sure some other people all publicly campaigned for the csm and then when the ballot came out and their names weren't on it, they suddenly disappear because ccp has excluded them because of their in game actions. these people all use the same reasoning - can't talk about ccp communications.
---
apart from that registration thing though, the thing that is most annoying is that ur backing this guy for csm for some reason. you said this:
---
&gt; He’s thorough, communicative and willing to consider other peoples’ points of view – exactly what wormholers need from a CSM.
---
yep, that's all well and good, but it is easy to be nice and pander to everyone. it's a different thing to have a good understanding of the game. i don't know about you but looking at history, what wormholers really need is someone who understands the mechanics so that when ccp makes changes like the fax change and the site changes in 2016, it goes the right way and not the wrong way. you don't need someone who is super nice and listens to every single little thing people say - 90% of what people suggest to the csm is garbage, and i should know, noobman would show me all his mails for years.
---
i actually have a great example on this. just a month or two ago his corp/alliance (wormhole society) was getting evicted by inner hell. hk and novac and some others turned up to save them (interestingly enough, for someone who apparently knows this guy well, you did not form your corp to come help, nor did you come yourself personally) and i was up until around 3-4am to help them push inner hell out, and mick did the same. we even let them use HK TS because their TS could not handle the number of people on it or something.
---
we pretty much had to babysit these guys otherwise they probably would have lost their home. my favourite moment personally which sticks with me is when this guy who you think is a great csm candidate had to ask us why you would rip the higgs off a rolling yacht, as he's about to warp them in to a wh bubbled by inner hell to roll it. if hk/novac didn't turn up inner hell would have trashed them. not to say it was a bad experience helping them - they seem like a cool group that is learning and if inner hell went for them again we would again go to defend, but there is a difference between running for csm and being a chill nice group.
---
if someone like this guy was on the csm, wormholes would be looked at as a joke by the null community. he doesn't even understand his own space, and it's a tiny corner of the game. someone who barely even understands wh mechanics, is not a good csm. i don't want to shit all over the guy but for me that is the reality of the situation - if you are not an experienced wormholer with a good understanding of how changes will impact us, you should not be on the csm representing wormholes.
---
there are far better csm candidates with a wealth of experience than this guy. maybe this is why he didn't want you to make this post.
---
Literally the entire game ganged up on you. *That's* what is needed to fuck you guys.

CCP has enough of a hard time with veterans who have been in this game for year or a decade. They have got a giant leap to make the game attractive to casuals. Alphas was not it. Have people never read the descriptions of stuff in game?

As an explorer, I actually feel like I accomplished something when I make it to safety with my loot avoiding hunters or just scraping out of a system.  I imagine hunters get the same feeling when they kill me.  But now it seems like they have given you guys bait.  Why the heck would I go to a system that I know has a bunch of sigs?  I know you or someone like you will be there.  I'll go to a system with less sigs but not turn as much of a profit.

Pretty much what Niedar said, they always had numbers, even if they didn't really have their shit together.

And they weren't beat on 'because they could', but because they were harassing members of other alliances by using their RL information, and for making memes about one pilot's father dying (IRL) that used to play EVE with him. Not really so noble.

---
In EVE you have to show initiative and drive. No one is going to go out of their way to help you if you're just sitting back and doing nothing, but you'll get more help than you can imagine by standing up, being humble, asking questions without being annoying about it.
---
Instead of sitting in a corner doing your own thing when you were in TEST, you could have re-contacted your recruiter about the mentor situation... Asked for links to their new player help materials (which they have a massive amount of), and perhaps asked for a transfer to brand new bros since they're more new player oriented than dreddit
---
There’s nothing random about it, promotions are factored into your quarterly budgets based on hitting KPI and tracked numbers (EBIT etc) in the previous financial period.
---
There will be internal spreadsheets that go into this kind of thing. My current bet is they’re doing 2 promotions a quarter; one based on plex price discount, the other on some form of subscription discount.
---
Lmao there are lots of subcap PvP tweaks and changes coming, are you retarded?
---
Subcap heroes are my favs
---
You can predict the re-occurrence of a promotion we have never seen before?
---
Yes. The best sites were very dangerous, you needed a tanky t3c to run them. You could get away with the exploration t2 frigates, but required luck, patience, and lots of kiting.
---
Anyone that actually wish for someone to get fired and homeless IRL  (and other nasty things) over a game probably need to check their priority in life.
---
Escalations was already moved out of an obscure tab in the journal (probably a year ago) and into the bottom option in a drop down menu in the Agency.
---
I know this is mostly true, but I can never find the source/announcement of it.  I think it was just a CCP post on reddit that didn't actually change the EULA, but regardless, do you happen to know where that was posted?
---
Sorry, I remember reading some "clarification" post from CCP about it, can't find it.
---
RIP elo and chori, honestly :(
---
it is far cheaper to sub for sp than to inject if you got a lot of sp....
---
Nothing
---
&gt; 2/ i got lot of stuff far from jita and went through few low sec system. Is it completely unreasonable to make my way back **with a battleship loaded with my stuff** ?
---
yes. [if the stuff is actually valuable](https://evepraisal.com/), put it up on public contract for something like 80% of jita value. ignore the value of your fit rigs. you probably rigged the ship wrong (projectile rigs on a mega), or fit t2 CCCs that no one wants in order for your self rep megathron to be cap stable.
---
Name the contract "firesale" and if the price is actually decent someone will buy it. You can make a contract for 4 weeks now.
---
There are actually people on the eve forums that run services where they will buy any contract, but generally have strict rules about what theyll accept and at what price. that would be the easiest and fastest way to empty your assets.
---
Alternatively just leave it there. Its not going to turn to dust sitting in a hangar and spending 2 or 3 hours flying a battleship loaded with 200 mill worth of odd modules is not going to be worth your time since you can pull 200 mill in relic site exploration in half an hour.
---
The battleship is most valuable strip, platinum insured, and self destructed on the undock. Battleships are slow as fuck. dont fly 30 jumps in a battleship so you can sell it in jita.
---
Unless its actually in an active pvp area, then maybe you can list it on the market and someone will buy it in a reasonable amount of time.
---
I completely disagree with you, I know lots of ppl who like to scan with their asteros and role-play as explorers from some books.
---
No no dude, they meant cum
---
 Another legendary moment in eve online how it shows you just never really know how things will play out in the end o7

You and me both bruv.
---
Eve is just another generic WoW clone (In space) now. Did you really expect anything else after Pearl Abyss took over?
---
High five
---
Even though Eve is known for having trolls and blowing up people for fun stuff that you would think would be a horrible environment for someone with anxiety it’s actually a great place for it.  Small to mid sized corps are pretty easy going and coms are bullshitting and jokes.  
---
For me anxiety comes from meeting new people and new places.  But they are just voices.  I don’t know if I can explain this clearly but the panic feeling of omg too many people and they are looking at me and judging me and laughing at me and ok try to walk across the room like a normal human and dear god don’t trip or anything  well none of those triggers are there when it’s just voices.  We have folks with lisps or speech issues and even then no one cares really.  In a good group you get to know the person behind the screen but you also have the safety of that they and youARE behind a screen.  
---
Most corps have a public channel or discord where you can get a feel for how they talk and act.   You can tell the recruiter that hey I am nervous and all that.  First time talking when a large group was yeah was a bit scared but really most Eve players are nice and friendly.
---
This is basically to explo hunters what dotlan is to whalers.
---
&gt; he's not the type to create conflict for the sake of it
---
Sounds like his heart is not in it. Perhaps you want him to be CSM more than he does.
---
hmm why arent you helping defend Tribute?  Alphastar and Brothubob are there.
---
There'd be so many dicks.
---
Well so this isn't entirely true, I know that there was another candidate that had an issue where his submission went over the hidden limit for characters, and it successfully submitted with no error. In their case someone reached out to them and had the issue corrected though, so it's different than this.
---
Spending time cleaning out cheap structures just for them to spam them down everywhere once you guys bounce thats a yikes from me sweaty
---
One piece of information that I could already verify with this thread is how salty/impulsive/agressive Goons seems to be. Already raging and ranting before I even log in in Delve. I have a feeling it will be fun!
---
Ah, must just be a few corps with particularly iconic photos from the logo maker then
---
See I don't agree with this stance at all. A good CSM is not someone who fights like a stubborn child against CCP when something doesn't go their way, I accepted that I got a shit hand and did my best to explain the situation to all the parties that I'd garnered support from up until that announcement was made.
---
When the candidates were announced and I wasn't on the list, I reached out through the channels presented to me (and a few that weren't), in a cordial/respectful way and asked for some clarification and ideally a timescale so we could move forward with the internal WH voting. I will not change/compromise who I am because something didn't go how I wanted it to, and if I could present more/adequate proof of all this I would.

---
Looks like Toni Stark couldn't save the rorquals this time :')
---
What I do/have done in regards to communication with the WH community and other communities that I've spoken to directly is not pandering. If I pandered to everyone that gave me the time of day my stances would be vastly inconsistent and I'd get called out instantly. Taking multiple views/play-styles/approaches into account when looking at various changes is something that would be hugely beneficial to a WH CSM, especially since the very situation we find ourselves in limits us in numbers.
---
As for your statements about the eviction I will fully admit it was a big learning experience for us as it was the first attempted eviction of any scale against us since the reformation of WHSOC into the C4 and the formation of VITA. The Luxury Yacht pilot A) was not me, and B) did warp and die which is how they figured out you have to take the higgs rig out. So I'm not sure how any of that applies. https://zkillboard.com/kill/76419400/
---
How you have any opinion about my contribution to the eviction attempt is a mystery to me though, since I did not deal with you directly and to my recollection all the people that I did deal with directly seemed of the opinion that I did well. Of course things could be better, they always can, but I do apologize if your experience was less positive than the others involved.
---
Seeing as you seem to have based your entire post on a situation that wasn't me, I don't necessarily know how to close this, but since my only experience with speaking you directly was offering our full assistance in your own eviction I will only say that hopefully in the future I can convince you to reconsider your stance on me.
---
If you bring domis stock up on drones. You'll lose heaps if the defender decides to be a pain in the ass.

I did exactly that defending an armour timer once. Aggressors didn't show up for the structure timer.
---
It was never really that good to begin with, tbh.
---
eshhhh 1/10 spy. The only way non-horde alliances could have found out about this move faster, is if we posted it to there discord. It is all over our discord, if you going to spy at least get some goddam useful information.
---
fucking bless you Cdouble. Miss you my dude.
---
No Twitter Thot here
---
Heart is not aggressively beating my chest at CCP because things didn't go my way. When the candidates were announced and I wasn't on the list I went through the official channels that were open to me and discussed the issue in a polite/cordial manner, because that's how people should act towards people. Of course I'm angry/upset about not being on that list because of at worst a form submission error, I did every other step correctly and well ahead of the deadline because I was going on vacation. I made damn sure that everything was in order before I left, that every group I was speaking to knew I was leaving, that interviewers knew I wasn't going to be there and things had to be scheduled afterwards, everything. Obviously a lot has gone on since I hit that submit button, but I am 100% sure that I did not overlook literally the most important step in the process, but I cannot prove that.
---
After an year or so? When all wormholler hunters have quit.
---
The year is 2019. Nobody sane does that anymore
---
Extract and inject in rorquals. They will kw be even safer. Well, you will still need a probing alt to check those new sigs and see if they are WHs in the area, CCP mofos will help you spot right away.
---
I cannot prove that I hit that submit button, all I can prove is that I did everything else (sent the passport picture, notified all the groups I was talking to that I was leaving, scheduled interviews for when I got back, submitted the forum post, etc...) before the deadline because I knew I was leaving for vacation. All of that I can prove with pictures/logs, but in reality none of that matters in this context. All I would say is that I would be very surprised that someone would go through all the steps that I did and not be damn sure that they correctly hit submit on a form on a website.

There is one thing that I haven't read yet. Your killboard indicates an ability to fly the Tristan. Specialize in it, the Tristan has a very wide performance profile, it can brawl, it can kite and can neut. It is just a matter of fit. If you can buy 12 hulls fit them all inline  with your preferred fighting style (brawl or kite etc.). Know you are going to lose them, it helps with controlling your adrenaline when the fight starts. Pick your target T1 to T1, I'd you loose on for advice, remember to good fight (gf) in local. Keep trying you'll win soon enough.

---
Hi Vertiso how are you
---
that's a very small drop in a very large ocean my friend.
---
I mean, for a long time, I just did solo-mining in HiSec, carted my goods to market, sold them, repeat.  Then I researched cloaking and CovOps frigates so I could do some data and relic sites, and even poke around in LowSec or Wormholes if I wanted to (bonus points, you'll have some of the skills you need if you want to eventually fly Stealth Bombers, especially if you're also training missile skills leading up to Torpedoes/Bombs), as well as the Blockade Runners (which are handy for traveling around with some cargo).  You can also do the Sisters of Eve story arc (once every...three months, I think?) relatively easy solo, and level 1-2 missions are pretty accessible as well.  
---
All in all, the game is approachable to people like you and me that have social anxiety.  
---
A lot of people want voice coms and such for bigger fleet/corp/alliance stuff, but you don't have to do that stuff to have fun in Eve, and you also don't have to talk (a lot of larger organizations have F1 monkies, more or less "butts in seats"), giving you options to be shy as much as you want.  And, honestly, I've long felt text (me typing) stresses my social anxiety out far less.  
---
It's basically what you want to make of it.
---
Because 100 accounts plexing is a lot more $$ than a couple accounts buying game time. Even one account plexing is more $ than one account buying gametime
---
This is honestly complete BS, I was present defending the WHSOC eviction, not as a member of WHSOC. HK and NOVAC + others represented only 1/4 of the fleet, and it was merely their numbers that saved the eviction, IH just ran away like little bitches on the basis of numbers, not your incredible FCing or wonderfully talented linemembers. Secondly you're just picking up what random linemembers said in comms and using them to shit on Mortatian or whatever his name is, which is just rude tbh.
---
Pretty sure Karmafleet is not actually recruiting at the moment since we are at war but otherwise good vid. :)

I've been away from Eve for a while, what's the story going on now?  I just saw the cinematic trailer for this expansion, and it looks interesting, but I have no idea what that means in-game terms.  Will there be incursions across Hi/Low/Nullsec and/or Wormholes?  Will we be gathering with NPC factions to fight against some invading force that does lasting damage to things if we don't fight back (destroys player and NPC stations or makes those sectors unuseable, like a more "for serious" form of Faction Warfare, etc?), and what's the story of these guys?  Are they like the Jove?  The precursor species to the Rogue Drones?  The Sleepers, I guess?  Or are they something/someone different?

The only thing I didn't like about it was the one character that was just killed off like nothing.  Like...you have shielded super armor this entire time, get shot at well above that level of snipe and survive, and the WORST part is, they don't even let you get vengeance against that unnamed nobody of a Jackal.

I get that that's actually somewhat REALISTIC in the sense of war, but in a grand story (and given the Spartan Armor), it just felt really hollow.  Though it did make the final mission feel really cold and isolated and grim.  So in a way, it did boost the cinematic mood, but it just felt out of step with the rest of the narrative.  
---
But yeah, Fall of Reach was really the last really great Halo game to me.  Halo 4 was interesting, Halo 5 was...well, the less I say about it the better (even though I did like Buck \[I LOVED playing "normal Humans" in ODST\], and I liked Cortana's brief banter).  Hoping Halo 6 will be good, but after 5...  
---
...though it does make me wonder, I haven't heard anything about it, and it seems about time there should be rumors and teasers for the next game...
---
It's not really, if you have enough to fly a rorqual you have enough to use fitting tools to find out your m3/cycle and ore units/cycle and then compare that to how much each ore is worth.
---
About 2x the amount of a single hulk receiving roq boosts
---
Which one was first strike?
---
Any corp worth leaving respectfully will understand that: 1. It’s a game. 2. Decisions you make are for your own personal enjoyment.
---
P.S. make sure you don’t owe any corpies or directors anything.
---
But on a serious note all depends on what you are mining and are you mining for isk or for minerials to build stuff best normal ore to mine deffntly is spod I personally dont roq mine any more I just use it as a booster for my hulks which in my opinion is what it should of stayed
---
Lol Shirley temple
---
hi,
---
your corp didnt even know how to roll wormholes. you legitimately did not even know how to roll your own static.
---
numbers do not matter. yeah we actually didnt bring that many boys at all with hk + novac combined. you would have lost to inner hell, 100%. max is far more talented than you, and his 40 boys would have smashed your drake navy doctrine.
---
Thx for the answer, will try to sell stuff and make a contract for the rest.
---
i just checked roughly, got around a billion isk value for all the stuff. i prefer having some isk with it to buy what i want directly in my new spot.

I don't think you read my reply.. you ignored one point because you don't like it, and are acting as if I'm a member of WHSOC.

fact is. outnumbered so fucking heavily it hurts my head to think, and theyre still forming, and winning xD

The Earth got glassed once.  The collision between Theia and the earth gave off so much heat, there was a silicon plasma atmosphere shared between earth and the newly forming moon for a few hundred years.  The entire surface was melted.

sorry, which other points did i ignore?

NC/PANFAM didnt have FAX. Goon side did

Screw a background, just let me escape to a Character selection screen

It helps to include an actual battle report of said fight for context.
---
The best part is that when people first noticed this on sisi they said it was just a bug that would get ironed out. Screw community management, CCP isn't just deaf to players, they literally lie to us about even minor features.

---
You should feed us with picture proof of this legion face
---
Feel like I should weigh in here as well, because imo this post is bullshit. I don't really know what got you so pissed about Morts' candidacy, or maybe you were just having a bad day when you wrote this, but let's get a couple of things straight here.
---
*yep, that's all well and good, but it is easy to be nice and pander to everyone. it's a different thing to have a good understanding of the game. i don't know about you but looking at history, what wormholers really need is someone who understands the mechanics so that when ccp makes changes like the fax change and the site changes in 2016, it goes the right way and not the wrong way. you don't need someone who is super nice and listens to every single little thing people say - 90% of what people suggest to the csm is garbage, and i should know, noobman would show me all his mails for years.*
---
Kinda the point, at least from my and others' perspective, is to have a candidate that represents the wormhole community. As in, someone who is going to take the wormhole communities concerns back to CCP and try to get them addressed. I've been working with Mort for about a year now on building VITA, and he 100% doesn't "pander" or just agree to be nice, as anyone who's worked with him will tell you. Does he know everything about Eve? No. I doubt anyone does. He does have a pretty substantial knowledge base though, which is enough for most of us.
---
*i actually have a great example on this. just a month or two ago his corp/alliance (wormhole society) was getting evicted by inner hell. hk and novac and some others turned up to save them (interestingly enough, for someone who apparently knows this guy well, you did not form your corp to come help, nor did you come yourself personally) and i was up until around 3-4am to help them push inner hell out, and mick did the same. we even let them use HK TS because their TS could not handle the number of people on it or something.
---
we pretty much had to babysit these guys otherwise they probably would have lost their home. my favourite moment personally which sticks with me is when this guy who you think is a great csm candidate had to ask us why you would rip the higgs off a rolling yacht, as he's about to warp them in to a wh bubbled by inner hell to roll it. if hk/novac didn't turn up inner hell would have trashed them. not to say it was a bad experience helping them - they seem like a cool group that is learning and if inner hell went for them again we would again go to defend, but there is a difference between running for csm and being a chill nice group.*
---
First thing here. All of us here were really grateful that you guys and other groups showed up to help us against a 100+ man Inner Hell fleet coming to evict us. That was super kind of all of you, and we'll definitely remember it. I don't know, and I don't think we'll ever know, if we would have held on our own or not for that, so really appreciate you all showing up. But. That being said. You all never would have gotten in if we hadn't have taken hole control, which we did entirely on our own. We had appropriate doctrines for what was happening, a moderate capital fleet, and we had prepared for an attempted eviction against us for a long time. The extent of the "babysitting" y'all did was offer us some advice on the proper implementation of fax vs traditional logi, bubbling their pos, (Which as far as I'm aware did nothing, seeing as they were in an entirely boosh based comp) and having us use your TS because we use Discord but a lot of other larger groups use TS, and coordinating everything was easier on that platform. Not saying we weren't grateful that you were there, because we are. And not saying that we did everything 100% correct and didn't need the help. That's most likely not true either. But claiming you had to "babysit" us is horseshit. You know it, I know it, and anyone that was there in comms with us during that time knows it. Climb off.
---
When it comes to the specific example of the yacht, it's weird. It's like we're a new player friendly, willing to teach others wormhole group. It's almost like we've got a substantial portion of our members that really don't know a lot about the game as a whole, and wh space in particular, and we're doing what we can to teach them what we know. Weird. It's almost as if one of the basic tenants of who we are, which dictates our attitudes towards new players, our choice of wormhole (C4, NOT C5 because the C3 static is better for our new guys) and a lot of the way we operate would sometimes limit the knowledge base of an average linemember here at WHSOC unless there was someone more experienced online to show them a better way of doing things. Weird.
---
The 2nd point here is that while Mort was instrumental on kind of the "back end" of that eviction (I.E, getting word out to the groups that showed up, helping coordinate voice/fleets etc) and while he 100% helped out in space as well both at an organizational level and at the FC level, I'm the one that leads most of our fleets and led our fleets during that eviction. I was the one making most of the calls about what/how we should be doing things, so if any mistakes were made they most likely were on my end. And I've been playing this game for all of 1.5 years. I absolutely 100% do not have nearly the knowledge base of someone like Mort, or yourself, when it comes to mechanics of this game. So if you want to call someone out for a lack of knowledge, I'm your target, not him.
---
And
---
*if someone like this guy was on the csm, wormholes would be looked at as a joke by the null community. he doesn't even understand his own space, and it's a tiny corner of the game. someone who barely even understands wh mechanics, is not a good csm. i don't want to shit all over the guy but for me that is the reality of the situation - if you are not an experienced wormholer with a good understanding of how changes will impact us, you should not be on the csm representing wormholes.*
---
A: Wormhole CSM's are already looked on as a joke by the nullsec community. I doubt having Mort as a candidate vs anyone else is gonna make any difference there. And seeing as your previous statements about his knowledge base were completely inaccurate, pretty sure your idea of his actual knowledge base about wh's or the game in general is also utterly wrong. And even if it wasn't and he didn't have a 100% perfect idea of exactly how wormholes work, he'd still be a good candidate for CSM. He's willing and able to put the work in, he meshes well with the wormhole community as a whole, and he's excellent at working with others to get their ideas off the ground and turned into a reality.
---
Your opinions here are wrong, and not based on facts. Next time, maybe get your shit straight before calling someone out for wanting nothing more than to make wh's a better place for all of us. Thanks.
---
Damn I hate to break it to you but that's one ugly looking face on that ship :(
---
hi, i personally feel its pandering but again that's just me, and it's my opinion.
---
i agree an eviction is a stressful time and mistakes get made. however looking at how much i got upvoted here, and things people have said about you now that i have started this discussion (https://i.imgur.com/TnUMD5W.png), i feel like the more experienced players probably agree with me. i just dont feel you have the understanding of whs.
---
just because we do not deal directly does not mean i am not told things. most of what loro told you to help with your eviction came from me telling him what to tell you. all the things he told you to buy and all the counters that we would have used if there was a fight, i told him to tell you. im too busy to talk directly to people usually so i tell my leadership to pass things on.
---
you shouldn't take this personally, i love your group and think that you guys are awesome and we always have your back in game, but i personally get pretty defensive when people who i think have very little game knowledge run for the csm, because i do strongly feel that our wormhole csm should be people who have a good understanding of everything in whs.
---
Thank you, I'd deeply appreciate that.
---
I have been thinking about putting together a presentation on this exact topic and how its effected me in game. I would echo try smaller groups, be clear from the start how your brain works so when you ask for the 100th time if what you did was ok they know why and they will understand why you would suddenly go quiet on comms or disapear if things get daunting. If you dont like the corp you can leave without fanfare, no harm in moving around till you find a good fit. 
---
Public fleets are a good idea to get used to how comms work and still be pretty anonymous, I would recommend Bjorn Bees fleets as he isnt going to call you out more than giving instructions to align and what not. 
---
Remember, you are a small part of a huge game, nobody is going to put a mistake you have made up on Reddit or call you out publicly. You will make mistakes everybody does, it will make you want to clam up but it will be forgotten about pretty quickly if you show an eagerness to learn and correct the mistake and everything will be peachy. Whilst the anxiety sometimes will make you want to be open about you in real life try not to connect who you are out of game to you ingame, this will help with the nagging feeling in the back of your head or creeping imposter syndrome that you are about to be "outed" for something.

Except the 100 accounts plexing don't pay a single $.

We have players paying $$ so others can use the PLEX to vote.

(Worst case: new player buying PLEX while staying Alpha, you don't get to vote but still pay)

Maybe they should switch it to one vote/gametime subscription.

I'm not sure what live stream you're talking about but I don't think it's a reliable source on Goon fleets going out.
---
there are several tactics to clean this sites :  
---
a pair of tinker rattle  
---
2 or 3 nestor 
---
a marauder (it will be hard)  
---
a dread  
---
a long range kite ship like oracle or cerb (instrumental only) +150  km range and good speed
---
a very long range FOF ship, raven or barghets, 300-400km range    
---
a bomber (can be long and tricky, but it work)  
---
take care, the vital site is way harder than the instrumental site. with a pair of rattles or nestors, you have to be ready, with your ships in the gaz site when the 2 first BS arrive. killat least one BS before the 2 other come. you cant tank 4 of them

Shield Paladins for running sites effectively. You want to maximise output from sites, by doing this you can eventually move to c5, build up an arsenal and continue to farm.
---
A friendly advise : If you are afraid about loosing ship and think NS is a dangerous place. You are not ready for WHs
---
So your saying the same system that managed to get 44 CSM candidates in, somehow magically failed for just your guy? No one else? But when CCP told him why he was off they gave him a reason he couldn't disclose? Sounds like he did something wrong and your just going attack dog blaming CCP for not fixing his fuckup.
---
I’d say, use drones and DDA if you have free lowslots to create a bait Maller with somewhat acceptable DPS, fleet up with your Cruse and use the command "Guard" (or assist, I forgot) with the Maller’s drones on the Curse. That way, they’ll follow the aggression of your curse, and you’ll get a bit more DPS.

I did not know this site existed...awesome.

I would love to get into WH stuff someday, but I just hate having to have large ships to do anything (at least, I THINK their sites are all guarded and require combat ships).  It's so odd, WHs seem to be ideal for exploration gameplay, but they're super focused on combat instead...

I think the brown, effeminate kid who booshes drones is more effective at combating goonswarm than ncpl
---
my only issue is, this states the batleships were smashing Logistic ships,
---
no no, that baltect fleet sat there, in thier own bubble, being circled by 2 sharks slowly dying away, with thier Goon FC painting targets 2-3ticks before calling primary, and never really moving at all. the baltec fleet looks like miners being shot by hunters.
---
the logi cruisers died when thier fleets were leaving, and a sabre bubbled the entire fleet, and unfortunatly as 4-500 goons jump through they aimed at the logi cruisers and ALmost got all of them.
---
If you'd manage to get 15 guys, you could go with Vexor/Osprey. (Vexor with blasters and drones for about 600dps per ship, and the osprey capchain is pretty solid, so they even rep, when under heavy neuts)
---
Seems like every time I undock my exploration astero all the other explorers come out in their stabbed asteros and covops explorers, but as soon as I get my rocket nemesis there’s nothing for 2 hours and then an exploration tengu, lol
---
I'm not sure I agree.  Most of my time in Eve has been "casual", or what you would probably call casual.  I HiSec mined for literally years.  I've done relic and data sites in Empire space.  I eventually learned CovOps and Cloak skills because I wanted to be able to travel undetected, which of course led me to bombers eventually, and I learned Logi because I love being a healer in games.  
---
I've done HiSec Incursions, Sisters of Eve epic arc 2-3 times, and dabbled in poking my noes in WHs before quickly running back.  
---
But I've also done NulSec Sov as a member of a few cool groups of people and been part of some decent sized fleets.  
---
So I don't think I'm hardcore at all, but I like Eve okay.  Granted, I don't play all the time (but I've tended to keep my sub up a lot, so I have a surprising amount of SP just because of how long since I made my character, and am that guy that goes "Oh yeah, you mean these skills/ships?  Yeah, I have that/can fly that, too...")  
---
I feel like there should be more for casual players to do in HiSec/vs NPC stuff and structure stuff should be more accessible (I've felt for years there should be an XSmall sized POS for solo players, and the Depot doesn't cut it, since you can't dock there), but other than that, the game is more accessible to casuals than most people think.  
---
...I believe this is because most people think all of Eve's content is PvP focused (which is fair in a way as most of it, from Sov Warfare to playing the market can be), but it's not exclusively so.  There are some options for casual play.  The game just isn't at all good about pointing you to them.  
---
Like no matter how much they tweak this Agency stuff, where does it say "How about you try out HiSec Incursions?  Here are the skills you need and some money for an intro Logi and here's a shout out to some Incursion running groups..."?  
---
It doesn't.  
---
And on the one hand, the sandbox is what's awesome about Eve.  On the other, it's like CCP is trying to be hand-holdy on the stuff basically NO ONE needs their hands held for, yet are silent on the things people actually DO need help with - decent starter fits, casual groups to link up with, etc.
---
I heavily doubt that a Praxis like this could clear the Site. (A Solo Praxis in general would be though). This fit with no implants, no heat gets you 114k EHP, with really low killing speed (739 DPS with Ogres &amp; Antimatter, which you will probaby not use in a site like this). Pure buffer fits are always a bit of a problem, as you have to rely on completeing a Site in a set time (before you buffer runs out, idealy). In theory you could warp back to a structure or offgrid to regenrate, but the ratts in the site are able to Scram you.

The first advise was the most important one IMO. When I fit a frigate I generally put all the T2 modules that I want and then if I need fitting I use a few modules that use less fitting (generally have "compact" in their name) or if I need capacitor stability I use enduring ones.

&gt;Another misconception is that we´ll ban people for posting ticket replies which is not accurate. Over 15 years we’ve very rarely banned players for violating this clause (single digit number) and it’s always been on the back of a stack of previous warnings or over a wilful attempt to falsify or misconstrue communication for nefarious purposes.

So you're fixating on one, small, aspect of a much broader knowledge base that Mort may have (and may not have, I don't know the conversation you're referring to) gotten wrong, once. Seems like an awesome thing to use to decide whether someone should be running for CSM.

When you do a ‘show info’ in the ship in space, in the top left of the graphic there’s a little symbol to indicate if it’s T2 or faction or whatever. As others have said, T1 frigs should engage other T1 frigs.

Muninns in "shield fleets" may not be great. Muninns in Muninn fleets are amazing, a big part of the strength is in the alpha potential. If you don't have enough, they're nowhere near as dominant as they are in big bloc null fights. If I'm tanking and spanking in jspace I might just bring gilas/cerbs/eagles.

sure thing, noobman was an FC in PL, was regularly on channel command with them on mumble doing fleets, was in blue donut which is a discord server full of well respected null fc's. he was trusted with PL API's. i would say that counts as respect from null groups.
---
both corbexx and two step were both pretty well respected by the community too, until corbexx left for goons (i guess you have no idea who either of them are), in fact part of my hostility to people with bad experience in whs is because corbexx, the wh csm in 2015, was a "diplo" rather than a fc/pvper, and he was responsible for a lot of the shitty site mechanics at the moment. and then after that he left for goons.

imagine saying "prove it" in response to asking if noobman was respeted lmao. what an actual joke.

i get you guys are a new player alliance, and i think that's another reason why your guy is a bad candidate. like i said on the leshak point which you ignored, a new player corp isnt really involved in those sorts of fights with max shaks/bling faxes and dreads. so how is he going to get the experience to represent us? the meta has already changed twice because of cap changes in the past few years as a result of stuff ccp has done, and it will happen again before long i'm sure, and so we need the right people there to point ccp in the right direction for it.
---
i thought they delayed that
---
Now before you make me use dyslexic as an insult as well, I was advising OP. Idc about none of the racist, homophobic and whatever bullshit, it doesn't affect my life. If I don't like something, I stay away from it, simple. Try reading before you comment.
---
I mean that's just whatever your units/cycle is divided by 100.
---
I've had problems with this process in the past myself - If things were properly done on Exooki's part I feel it'd be a shame to leave him off the ballots. Although it wouldn't be the first time legacy code has fucked wormholers, I suppose.
---
For reference the CSM did advocate against this change.
---
Accurate video,

nothing but moveops and structure bashing lol
---
well if you want to go for soe might want to try two rr strats for pvp.  just make sure that you mentally lost all attachments to the ships you bring in the hole, cause you will lose em. just engage every little fucker that dares to tresspass in your hole in give em some drone dps love. and when you die make sure you laugh about it

---
The community is always the most important aspect, but CCP cannot point players to the Community. They can’t point new players to TVP or WTM for the same reason that they can’t suggest that a new player choose Karmafleet or Horde.
---
Regardless of how you got there, statistics show that it you’re still playing the game, odds are, other people were involved, along the way. That is why I suggest that CCP accept their fate: they guide others to a treasure they cannot possess. The ability to answer “now what?” for a Newbro.
---
CCP _needs_ older players.
---
Not as far as I've seen. It's in the patch notes.
---
Frigate fights are very short and the most newbro friendly entry point, ubfortunately. You will not know what really happened without more experience. Record your fights and look at them afterwards to see what really went down.
---
Everything will reset to a backup from a random day in 2013 with no chance to recover.
---
a couple years ago xenuria posted a video of a fleet he went on where they "totally owned tishu and horde"
---
the video mostly consisted of him burning around in a cormorant and running his mwd then broadcasting for cap (in a cormorant fleet with no logi), unable to shoot primary targets because he capped himself out mwding around
---
the actual fight had gone, phorde had a confessor fleet and got goons to engage them, tishu bridged in arty sleipnirs with triage on the other side of the gate and jumped in, we tag-teamed the goon fleet to dust while the triage went red, then cheesed it as goon supers midded. it was hilariously one-sided and not in goons' favor at all
---
but they "totally owned us"
---
in general i have found that line goons have zero concept of how to evaluate how a fight is going and will often assume they are doing well because "we're goons, we win fights lol"
---
Ah, cool. Good to know, thanks!
---
Ah, neat.  Thanks for the info!  I'll have to play around with this.
---
you should have seen them, it was funny to look at them just sit there and take a beating. like, if your waiting there until your help arrives, and you loose 60bill in stuff 'waiting/baiting' for reinforcements, as soon as they get here were going to leave just to spite you xD
---
*i hate to break it to you but one "small aspect" isn't something like that lmao, ehp is a pretty basic concept my friend* 
---
I'd say that ehp could have several different definitions. The one you use or are referring to isn't necessarily the "one", and maybe mort was simply looking at it a different way. Again, haven't seen the convo. I know that I could, off the top of my head, give you at least 3 logical, supported by data definitions of "EHP" for eve. And even if he was wrong, pretty sure he'd own up to it and get it fixed sharpish. That's generally just the way he works. Making a mistake about a game aspect isn't generally the end of the world, being unwilling to fix it is a much larger problem I'd say.
---
*i get you guys are a new player alliance, and i think that's another reason why your guy is a bad candidate. like i said on the leshak point which you ignored, a new player corp isnt really involved in those sorts of fights with max shaks/bling faxes and dreads. so how is he going to get the experience to represent us? the meta has already changed twice because of cap changes in the past few years as a result of stuff ccp has done, and it will happen again before long i'm sure, and so we need the right people there to point ccp in the right direction for it.*

---
I mean, yeah, we don't regularly do "max bling" fights day in and day out with capitals. There's a reason we live in wormholes, and low class at that. Most of us don't really like fielding/playing with them. But we do have some experience with it. I'd say that the "max shaks/bling faxes and dreads" is actually a pretty small part of the entire wh meta at the moment. I mean, if you look at most of the kills in jspace, how many of them are what you're describing, and how many of them are mostly subcaps/not max bling whatevers? Pretty sure that's the vast majority. And I'm not the guy to be talking to about Leshak balance, that's completely outside the scope of this conversation which is why I ignored it. If that conversation happens between Mort and CCP (if he made it to the CSM) then the answers simple. he'd say what we as a community wanted him to say. That's kinda the primary thing about him as a candidate, representing the wh community, not just going off on his own ideas all the time.
---
*imagine saying "prove it" in response to asking if noobman was respected lmao. what an actual joke.* 
---
No disrespect intended, but throwing baseless assumptions out without proof does literally nothing to further the convo. I wasn't around when noobman was playing. All I know is, as far as I can tell, the majority of null players don't like or respect wormholers at all. I assumed those feelings extended to our previous CSM candidates, but I'm happy to be wrong there.
---
*both corbexx and two step were both pretty well respected by the community too, until corbexx left for goons (i guess you have no idea who either of them are), in fact part of my hostility to people with bad experience in whs is because corbexx, the wh csm in 2015, was a "diplo" rather than a fc/pvper, and he was responsible for a lot of the shitty site mechanics at the moment. and then after that he left for goons.*
---
I wasn't aware that a CSM candidate can be directly responsible for changes to the game of that magnitude. Has CCP's attitude towards the CSM changed over the past few years, or am I just reading other people's accounts wrong? (Jestertrek etc) Seems to me that CCP does what it wants, and the CSM is there to give input from the playerbase, but a good portion of the time it's ignored/changed to fit what CCP wants to get done.
---
I don't disagree.
---
I guess what I mean is that there ARE things to do, and that CCP could do, but that they don't.  Again, they try to hand-hold on things people don't need hand holding, but they don't do so on things people actually DO need help with.
---
Even something so basic as careers giving you ships and the modules/skill books to create a good (basic T1) fit so you see how to match bonuses to specific weapons/utility/mining, or something like a slightly easier SoE arc geared specifically for brand new players that the game takes you to.
---
The SoE arc ITSELF is almost a good intro, but it's a little highly tuned for super new players (a T2 Frig cuts through it like a hot knife through butter, but a character less than a week old probably couldn't defeat the Gnosis at the end due to its recharge rate on its shields), but the game doesn't point you to it at all.  I didn't even know about it until someone pointed me to it in a 2 (3 with me in it) man corp I joined because I played with one of the two guys in WoW.
---
CCP does need older players - but every MMO does.  Eve just needs them far MORE because of the complexity of the game.
---
But I think there are things CCP could do, they just aren't doing them for whatever reason.  My best guess is because they realize they need to do something, but they don't remember/know what it's like being new and so can't figure out what that something is.
---
Which corp are you talking about? O_o
---
We can only hope
---
&gt; I'd say that the "max shaks/bling faxes and dreads" is actually a pretty small part of the entire wh meta at the moment. I
---
its the entire meta for high class corps, if you ask anyone in hk hawks or novac what their favourite fights are, they will probably tell you that it's really epic heavy armor/heavy shield fights. if your candidate doesnt understand how those fights go down and how changes can impact them for the worse, then he doesn't represent us. that's not so hard to get i hope. that's how we feel - he doesn't participate in this meta, so how can he represent us?
---
&gt; I wasn't aware that a CSM candidate can be directly responsible for changes to the game of that magnitude. 
---
they absolutely can be. don't buy into reddit saying ccp never listen to the csm. they do at times, and they have in the past. the entire pve rework in 2016 was thanks to corbexx. corbexx gave input that cap escalations were broken, but the input he gave on how to fix it was unfortunately completely wrong, and so shitty changes happened.
---
You can also try the Fed navy comet (if you have a bit of isk), they are fairly cheap at 14mil a piece last I chcked. Blaster fit that baby with an AB, scram and web. You should be able to take some things down, they do very high dps for a frigate.
---
There has only been one instance so far of them decreasing the amount of plex they charged for 30 days of game time. The OP is not asking about general discounts on buying plex but on discounts on buying 30 days of game time in the NEX store using plex
---
We've lost a lot of old members the last few years.
---
I doubt we can field 500 titans between all our TZs and alliance, tough they may exist within our ranks.  
---
We're getting old, the game has changed, many don't have time to commit to 3-8 hour play sessions, etc.
---
Glassing means something different here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKg-09lzX_E

im gonna go ahead and guess that the cosmic signatures are going to accidentally show the type of signature it is (Relic, Data, WH, Gas) and will be iterated on by the fall expansion.
---
Good write up, I had fun reading it!
---
Yeah but compressed has a different price to uncompressed due to being able to transport more of it. And as op is unable to work any of this out for themselves I feel like we need to state every part of it for them.
---
The only silver lining I am clinging to is that the monster COULD be put back in the bottle. If this change is ever reverted then things will go back to normal.
---
I will work towards this day. I want to explore again.

There was no point where goons were heavily outnumbered for a long time

Hmm... not one pbuh, and you even mention some 'The Emperor'. So I can only surmise that you are talking about some fake arse bitch and not Mittens (pbuh).
---
Expect a knock on your door tonight.
---
Thats not how the CSM works though. CCP say "hey guys we're thinking about doing x what do you think". If you don't know enough about the game to imagine why x might be a problem you've missed your opportunity. You can't "represent" other people views by asking for wifer feedback because of the NDA (this is pretty much exactly what I think happened with Brisc).
---
Ex-CSMers have been saying this for years, its really not complicated.
---
With this atmosphere of black space and endless danger, few games can match
---
*its the entire meta for high class corps, if you ask anyone in hk hawks or novac what their favourite fights are, they will probably tell you that it's really epic heavy armor/heavy shield fights. if your candidate doesnt understand how those fights go down and how changes can impact them for the worse, then he doesn't represent us. that's not so hard to get i hope. that's how we feel - he doesn't participate in this meta, the oldest meta in whs which has evolved like crazy over the past decade, so how can he represent us?*
---
So this is entirely a different conversation then what you were saying before. "I don't want a lowclass candidate because I live in highclass and I don't feel like he can represent me properly/doesnt' play here so he doesn't know how the mechanics work" is completely different than "this candidate doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to eve mechanics and his alliance is shit at wh's, therefore he also must be shit at wormholes" If you don't want a lowclass candidate, just say so. Now, I'd say that when it comes to who represents more of wormhole space population wise, there's more overall lowclass residents than C5/6 residents, so if majority opinion goes then it should be a lowclass rep on the CSM, not highclass. I was working under the assumption that we were all wormholers and wanted to make the game better for all of us in general, not just one aspect of jspace, but hey, what do I know. Evidently we shouldn't have a CSM candidate who doesn't directly and only represent just max bling armor/shield/capital fights in wormhole space. How silly of me to assume otherwise.
---
*they absolutely can be. don't buy into reddit saying ccp never listen to the csm. they do at times, and they have in the past. the entire pve rework in 2016 was thanks to corbexx. corbexx gave input that cap escalations were broken, but the input he gave on how to fix it was unfortunately completely wrong, and so shitty changes happened.
---
another perfect example of it is the z142 nerf, one csm member complains, and it's nerfed.*
---
Alright, thanks. I'll keep it in mind.
---
*you realise hk owns an entire region of null and has the for the past year? we wouldn't be able to hold it if people didn't have at least some level of respect for us and what we would do if we lost it.*
---
I know that y'all own a null region. I assumed that you still had it simply because noone big enough has cared to take it from you. To me that's not a matter of respect, that's simply your space not being worth Goons/PH/whoever's time.
---
When I made a new account (recently) and tried the starting missions for the professions I found the Agency to be somewhat helpful, albeit I found the agency window was only useful in between missions. Still, I think this could be a good idea.
---
yes and in my opinion Jon Hallur's soundtracks are one of the best
---
&gt; So this is entirely a different conversation then what you were saying before.
---
it isnt, where did i call your corp shit? i would not call you shit, because i do not think you are "shit", you are new players. i said you guys couldnt roll holes etc, i didnt call you shit. my point with those comments was to make the point that if you are a leader in that corp, you are the leader of a new player focused corp and not one that engages at the highest level of the meta. you are not exposed to the same things that leaders of larger/more experienced corps are. i could have made that clearer for sure, but at no point am i calling you shit.
---
&gt; I know that y'all own a null region. I assumed that you still had it simply because noone big enough has cared to take it from you. To me that's not a matter of respect, that's simply your space not being worth Goons/PH/whoever's time.
---
you are very very incorrect here and lack a basic understanding of null
---
What about nuclear ammo? That should glass something right?
---
Seraph and great posts are mutually exclusive
---
Imo keepstars are one of the biggest issues in the game, previously owning a super or titan effectively required a coffin toon (I mean you COULD leave it in a pos but...). That is a massive cost to owning a super or titan, much more than the cost of the ship. But now in many alliances you can just put your dread alt or even your main in your titan/super when you want to use it in big tidi cancerfests or when you’re mining with your 10 rorqs. It’s seriously reduced the bar of entry to super capital ownership.
---
They could partially fix this by making a very harsh limit on keepstars per region, but preferably convert keepstar docking restrictions to what forts are now, and keep their much stronger defensive abilities (which they’d still be used for as keepstars are cheap for many alliances).
---
Keepstars were never meant to be used as FOBs as they are now, and it’s very poor game design imo.
---
Never mind. That seems to have 0 heat. But phased plasma has a lot of heat.
---
It's like a warm blanket. https://youtu.be/O00L0OW-ebo
---
its a copy paste of what hilmar said.
---
Alright, so we're clear. You don't want Mort as a CSM candidate because he doesn't live in a C5, and therefore doesn't understand the C5 meta as much as you'd like?
---
Impossible
---
yes, that, and i think his eve + wh mechanical knowledge in general is poor.
---
nothing about him as a person or about people in your group being shit.
---
i prefer playing a game that's fun
---
There? Happy?
---
EMP from the glassing took out the shieds, thats why the shit went straight through, like it would outside cutscene
---
Cool. Thanks for clarifying.
---
This has happened before, 2 NPC mining operations went at it until a large number, I want to say like 1000 NPCs were going at it, with no players aware of it
---
no worries, didnt mean any offence to your group so if you took it that way my bad, just talking about your candidate only.
---
Critical moment?
---
Fall 2029?
---
Can someone make a decent mobile edit of this?
---
shit happens. Appreciate the conversation. i still think your opinion is wrong lol, but that's what opinions are for I think.
---
Only problem with this:
---
they look at single data-points, never looking at related ones.
---
So, by improving one thing, they kill multiple others
---
All changes they did, did not improve new player retention, it only alienated existing players.
---
CCP needs someone who can see the whole picture, morons working isolated on a single 'improvement' should be fired.
---
Thanks, I'm a bit paranoid in general playing games with lasting repercussions for loss. I'll make a good pile of cash from missions and head to NS soon

As you seem prety new in WH, I would say a cheap T1 brawl fleet. with augoror, brutix, prophecy etc...

if you find biger guy, ask for a fair fight. it will train you for real heavy armor fleet (T2/T3/trig and pirat BS).

For gank and skirmish, strat or T3c are good. Strat RR can be realy fun with 3-5 pilots.

At least 1 brave member must have known and dropped a MTU.
---
&gt; It’s seriously reduced the bar of entry to super capital ownership.
---
Counterpoint: supercaps long since passed the proliferation event-horizon, where any non-supercap fleet stopped being relevant in a sovwar. At this point, lowering the bar just makes it easier for more people to join the "people who matter" club.
---
1) Move to J-space. You have to haul that precious indy stuff to K-space to make profit. It creates PVP and grudges between neightbours.
---
2) Move to J-space. Hardly any capitals around since the mass limitations and no supercapitals to blap you around. Just fun subcap-cap-subcap-content.
---
3) Move to J-space. You get to keep the loot from citadels. No silly asset safety.
---
4) Move to J-space. No local. No silly automatic intel. You have to use your skills and ship abilities to get intel.

Move to J-space.

So what should he have done to them? The only mentionworthy things he got in his portfolio that i'm aware of are his evenews badposts and the claim of flipping Co2 in WWB, which he didn't actually have a hand in.
---
Hmm. Very odd. It definitely *was* in the patch notes when they were first released, so maybe it's been removed without announcement.

I hate you more than those two guys so this is even easier,

apparently that was enough

If they enjoy trig ships they might make the new trig hac their ship of choice

Careful with your expectations, that would require effort. CCP don't do that no more apparently, judging from the flagship updates of this year being a half assed balance pass and reskinned incursions.
---
Idk if I would call anchoring and pressing f1 pvp.
---
lmao a canadian
---
Are you sure the word you're looking for is hate and not pity?
---
Hi. Former WHSOC member chiming in.
---
1) Talking with Mort about balance changes was always fun because he and I liked to come up with new fits and strategies. He definitely knows his stuff and has a good understanding of the wormhole meta. When you're managing a group like VITA though, you have to compromise for lower SP pilots. Hence why some fits may seem sub-optimal for most of us but they are usable in the hands of their newer members.
---
Furthermore, just because VITA does not apply capitals/leshaks in their doctrines does not mean they don't understand how to use and/or fight against them.
---
2) You seem to praise Noobman without doubt. I do agree with you that he has done exceptional work representing wormhole space on the CSM but would also like to remind you of his play for hole controll during the HK eviction. Every player, regardless of skill, experience or status is going to derp at least once a day. The gravity of the derp is just a coin toss. You cannot use a single example as a foundation for your opinion.
---
3) Perhaps the worst of my arguments but honestly, who else in the wormhole community is willing to take up the task that can rival Mort? Yes, he may not be as experienced as Noobman or corbexx, but given the pool of viable wormhole space representers I'd have to say Mort is the most viable one.
---
4) You kind of contradict yourself by giving the example of corbexx being more of a diplo than FC because that is exactly what Mort is. You cannot deny the fact he's doing a pretty good job at that either given the amount of big groups that came to defend VITA during the eviction.
---
The book
---
I'm not saying that resource scarcity is a bad idea with hilarious unforeseen consequences that no one seems to consider but it should totally be implemented just to show you how bad of an idea it is and then you can all jam an umbrella into your bicycle wheels. 
---
Limiting local, delaying local, deleting local or launching local into the sun will have zero effect on any competent group of players or any competent botter
---
When every GM bar 2 thinks you're wrong, and you post like a cunt, maybe it's your fault?
---
its the entire meta for high class corps, if you ask anyone in hk hawks or novac what their favourite fights are, they will probably tell you that it's really epic heavy armor/heavy shield fights.
---
What? You want a wormhole CSM to represent the minority of elitist C5 corps, flying a minority doctrine? If actually look at the fucking stats for where people live and fight in wormhole space (would find the post but I'm on mobile) you just want some dude to represent your personal interests in the CSM.
---
Eve is the kind of game that gives back as much as you put in. It's completely fine to just dip your toes in and test the waters. 
---
You have a couple of options if you want to go deeper: Ask in /r/evejobs for a quiet, relaxed noob-friendly corp, join EVE Uni which is a moderately sized, friendly and very relaxed group, or join TEST/Horde/Karmafleet if you wanna drown out in the masses and join a bunch of turbo nerds. 
---
Either way, hope you find your path!
---
You're upset huh? How much isk have you lose to us?
---
No. Just no. the first 5 words were absolutely horrible. It's not that interesting and stop being fake about it.

Jump right in front of them!

Mid-class is a way for c4 corps to feel better about themselves
---
There's only high or low class. It's not insulting, it literally means can you fit a cap through a connection or not. You can't fit half a cap, tho it seems some wormholes allow half a brain.
---
hello, former whsoc member
---
1) i dont agree, but i guess we will have to agree to disagree. on that.
---
2)
---
&gt; would also like to remind you of his play for hole controll during the HK eviction.
---
noobman has been permanently banned from eve online for over a year and has not played in hk for 2-3 years now, you are very silly. on top of that, comparing someone doing something incredibly complex (combat probing in a 250 man fleet vs a basic ehp thing) is a pretty silly comparison.
---
3) i think some of the candidates running at the moment are far better. multiple are better than mort.
---
4) why do i contradict myself? did i say corbexx was a good csm? corbexx was perhaps the worst csm wormholes has never had, as i said with the silly changes that he was able to push through. if mort is also a diplo like him that supports my point that diplos generally don't make good csm candidates.

It mostly depends on your attitude.

Unsubbing today.
---
Said the Hybrid user, unless rearing to his drones
---
Doesn't really answer anything I said, just a technicality. Activity happens in low class.
---
TIL a rigged sotiyo is cheap
---
EVE running on minmatar tech confirmed.
---
BS-size AB and MWD are into reprocess pile most of the time.
---
They'd be far too cowardly for that.
---
The point is that the "wormhole CSM" needs to understand wormholes - not just his/her space.  If the candidate doesn't understand the meta that the major wormhole groups operate under, how can that person effectively represent them?  There are plenty of people living in low class space who still understand what the meta is.  Sounds like this guy doesn't.
---
If he isn't willing to get involved in the politics around an election, he is simply not a good candidate. If he/she or anyone else gets on the CSM, there is a lot of conflict and clashing of ideologies which has to happen in those cases. If your friend is unwilling to step into the ring, throw a few punches and take them in return to get his candidacy recognised, they are not passionate enough to be considered.
---
Yes, harsh, but also true. I would gladly vote for someone who fought tooth and nail to get onto the ballot. But someone who goes 'fuck it, someone else can plead my case'...they can go and get fucked and not waste a spot someone else could take that shows more passion, drive and charisma, even if they fail to win nomination in the final election. 
---
This whole situations goes to show he is not worthy of being on the CMS as he is not willing to engage in the greater eve community and plead his plight.
---
People who use PLEX to pay for their accounts, usually don't use PLEX they bought from CCP (because as you mentioned, it would be more $ then just buying gametime)
---
The people who buy PLEX from CCP do it to either buy SKINs/Extractors or to sell the PLEX on the market for ISK.
---
The people who buy SKINs/Extractors with their PLEX are not the problem, that PLEX is gone from the game.
---
The problem is the PLEX going to players who don't pay $ to CCP, but because they use the PLEX to subscribe their accounts, they get additional votes for the CSM.
---
But maybe I am the only one who thinks selling votes for ISK is wrong.
---
Rogue Drone data sites can escalate.
---
Concord spawn in their bazillions everytime CODE gets all trigger happy on a freighter in Jita, they'd probably welcome the change of scenery ... Would be highly amusing to see that big as mofo of a Trig ship get Concorded 2 mins after emerging from its hideyhole lol.
---
goddamn, nice!
---
I don't believe you
---
Hit the point spot on. Even on a larger scale than 5 man fleets, yesterday we brought the fight to DHSJ and because they are reasonable, we got to have 2 really good fights with sleips vs gilas and then a t1 cruiser fight. They easily could have dropped haw dreads and deleted us if they wanted to.
---
Worry not, CCP is closely monitoring the effect of the change and are planning future iterations.
---
title reported for misleading / false advertisement
---
Man I glad I just deleted it from my available episodes.
---
Did he finally post his suicide letter?
---
How much is an EVE Online PC case worth?, i have the amaar one.
---
You would be wrong. KarmaFleet does not halt recruitment for wars.
---
Wouldnt have been too hard to find the virgin
---
Thanks for reminding me goatse is a thing.
---
Yeah the cluster is not coming back online after dt...
---
?
---
No idea, but as soon as the server went down the launcher background refreshed immediately. So that's pretty neat.
---
Patchday broke my internet REEEE
---
Seraph and Great Post don't go along.
---
You could have killed drones while you were just sitting there (offensive mode). Also when you were barely taking damage, you could have switched to propulsion mode to help burn out or in then back to defensive. Nice fit tho! Its pretty tanky. Did you come up with it by yourself?
---
What war you talking about, the war against citadels?
---
Trigonometry, very funny indeed
---
I think he is referring to [Trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry), which is the math branch that studies the relationships between length and angles.
---
ur toxic ass if the last one that should be posting on if someone should be banned... toxic and support of racism  should of had you been ages ago....
---
is anyone seeing the option in the launcher to switch to 64bit? I can't find it but I'm also half asleep and drunk
---
they said downtime would be 30 minutes today, so the cluster isn't up yet
---
dude, it doesn't matter WHO bought it.
---
People wouldn't buy plex if no one bought it.
---
Twist it the way you want, a guy plexing his accounts is more profit for CCP than a guy buying game time
---
&gt;But maybe I am the only one who thinks selling votes for ISK is wrong.
---
This had nothing to do with it, you said buying game time is better for CCP than buying plex, its not.
---
&gt;We only support custom logos for alliances, not corps.  It's a somewhat manual process.
---
So, what about the question? Any chance for expanding icon pool. Would be nice.
---
Oh did not know that, thanks
---
Interesting idea and may be pretty straightforward to do.  I'll take it back to the team.
---
That’s very true, there are a lot of things all contributing to it
---
15W-GC - thanks for the structures
---
What racist stuff are you talking about??? Lol
---
30 minutes now...numerous restarts later...or maybe not. I normally leave patch day for 1 or 2 hours...miss those new isk mod/bpo/bpc drops. Ofc crap internet throttle speeds means big updates take like 20 minutes as well.
---
looks like a dope  trigonometry book cover
---
You could have preloaded most of the assets by checking out sisi yesterday,
---
not sure if i'm getting 'photoshopped' - is OP saying they added free noob ships to citadels like the NPC stations, only you have to click to spawn one?
---
also what is that yellow button, and what does it do?
---
you could have logged in on sisi, that way you have most of the changes already and the download gets a lot smaller, i just logged in at 11:22

when i look at these pikchi, i really want to return to the game, the space does not want to let go.
---
 User Interface:
---
* Added the Board My Corvette button; Corvettes will no longer be made available automatically on docking in a pod, instead the player can choose to be placed inside a corvette using this button. If the character does not currently have a corvette then they will be provided one and then boarded into it. If a corvette is already in the ship hangar the character will board it and the standard modules fitted will be repaired.
---
Nope, not there yet.
---
Coffee.. all over my shirt. Fuck you, take my upvote!
---
I really love the new beacon ACL mechanics, even though we've lost a JF to it (so far).

i've heard it's some kind of combat simulator, with  shitty controls and weird physics, so better just leave it how it is.

undock it and see yourself

We already had that though....
---

---
This post demonstrates exactly why I would never vote for Mort. Someone else hustled him into running, someone else *excessively* hustled him to submit everything, and now someone else is hustling CCP about his allegedly failed application process.
---
For a guy claiming to stand up for me, he surely haa been pushed around a lot by someone else with the nerve to call him a friend.
---
90% of the feedback lodged against Abyssal Deadspace and the introduction of mutaplasmids was negative too and that was some of the best content added to EVE. I have a pretty low opinion of the value of community wide feedback as a result.
---
On the exploration change however i'm definitely skeptical, we'll see how it plays out.
---
thx! question, does that mean i can spawn one even if i have other ships in the same place? or does it only work on citadels where i have no ships?
---
the beta launcher still launches the 32bit client, are we not supposed to be able to access the 64bit from today in beta?
---
If you're looking for the 64 bit client option, make sure you have restarted your launcher recently. It should be an option in the Settings window (right below the DX9 option)
---
Praise Avis
---
Judging from the phrasing I would assume that you will board a corvette, creating one out of thin air if you don't already have one in that station.
---
We have had that since forever.
---
Yes we had lmao

The view is very nice, I want to see more but titans would probably not enter atmosphere to avoid unecessary energy consumption that comes with a re-entry of a gigantic space shit/alien/plug/witch of several kilometers long ^^

The invasion was a success, THE END
---
Does that mean youre screwed

Its not a bug its a feature

im not seeing it after fulling restarting launcher... weird

just forget about it for the next few years, they scrapped it and are going to restart development because the gameplay looked janky as fuck.
---
Oh right, yeah. That was trash indeed, guess that's why i completely forgotten about it. Oh well.

We would get so many trig Mothership and titan BPC's from that lol. But yea, that would be cool. Some proper NPC fleet action would be fun and liven the game up a lot.

What launcher version are you running? on 1514855 (UI 6.1.9) it shows for me.

Suddenly a police Nyx jumps in

Really ? That's a whole pile of bullshit if that's so.

You will get a corvette on Stations and Citatels, no matter if you already have ships there or not. Also, you don´t get a new corvette anymore when you dock on a station with a pod but no ships

How to kill:

Might as well rename this Item to ESCAPE-300 now since this will be the only use from now on.

45 pages of trig homework hits you for a wrecking shot

To clarify, this pops up when I try to take the gate into the event site, I can still enter the solar system.

thanks mate, falcons post, there was a new patch, it had a check box for the 64bit client

mine is showing 1501045 6.1.9 weird why wont it update...

Lol... It looks like a Resource Wars warning...

Too late

Let me guess NC?

Oh wait you are this guy moving stuff in battleships near jita sometimes.

(also more colorful modules don't mean better tank)

Are you sure you're NOT trying to enter one of the Ressource war sites?

They blow up Jita 4-4 station

Its a step closer to generic MMO fetch quests, reducing effect of player skill.

Too bad they'll get bored of shooting structures before the reinforcement timer is even over.
---
Huh, you could use this model as a unit for Twilight Imperium\^\^
---
Currently you need to be running the beta version of the launcher in order to see the 64 bit client option. CCP mentioned on the forums that they are currently working on a non-beta launcher with the 64 bit option enabled.
---
Well tbh i always opted for ECM drones only due to fact that smarter newbies used this to drop tackle when they fucked up.
---
I am seeing a lack of pint glasses or bottles being used
---
Try switching from the Release branch to the Beta branch in the launcher (same settings window). That should force it to update itself.
---
Jita market is kill, bring out the pitchforks boys
---
Must be a recent change?
---
We are not allowed to remove the useless agency button from the neocom anymore. Otherwise update seems ok
---
Wonder when we will get the first trig invasion km, if not already...and also loss of the first new trig ships?
---
Theres none on the market
---
What a fantastic idea. I've been looking at that in the store each time I pass it.
---
It showed up for me eventually in the launcher settings (E icon to right) as a checkbook option. May have to first switch launcher version to beta and restart.
---
Their instructions to switch to 64 bit client are incorrect seemingly. There is no tickbox to 'Run clients with 64 bit' in my launcher settings as there should be - yet everything has downloaded and shows green. Yet the drop down menu that is at the top, lets you choose between 'Release' and 'Beta'? Or is that always there....
---
No ring on those fingers, therefore not goatse.
---
any of the doomsdays would be sufficient to glass an area.  the heart of nuclear explosions already glasses an area.
---
also lasers you are forgetting:  they are going to cause a massive thermal build up in an area - essentially creating a ball of plasma that is going to rapidly expand - going - guess what - boom.
---
And all the items that are on the market die with it
---
Bad news for you and Mar5meca Gold. No matter what you do, Delve is still safer than high sec.

oddly enough i dont have that option either.... I guess im shit out of luck :P

How do they hunt you? Do they scan you down (Triglavian Combat probes? :P)? Or are they gate camping?

Fucking bots and their hacks.

Well, that’s what I want my EVE mission to be. Contribute at my own very modest level to make it less safe
---
From chasing? Or from collision?
---
Yeah I don't think any pilots pvping are using T1 mods. Really should get those skills up and until then run away. Faction and T2 frigs will almost always wreck your shit. You can fit a crazy tank on a Tristan if you've got the skills though.
---
Unchecked player behavior is the source of a lot of eves problems, this just says that another way.

Oh but make sure you just buff pvp and nerf pve more, I'm sure that's the right way to do things, after all reddit upvotes said so!

Please elaborate.

are there any entity organizing fleets for that?

Annoyinglty it shows up under release in CCPs instructions.

That's not an invasion site, it's a resource wars site. The invasion NPCs have to be d-scanned or combat probed.
---
The invasion NPCs don't show up on the overview by default - you have to add them manually. There are lots of confused people in the invasion chat channels.
---
They're 'Invading Precursor Entities' under the 'entity' section of the overview settings window.

So you want the lp only for yourself. People that do the burner have the same right as you in the area. Npc null is open for all and is good because of that. Also they undocked in this space and make some activities there.
---
New players like me, who don't know what to do in this game, and would like to get a better grasp on how to do things?
---
I welcome the new Agency. I think it looks really nice, and as far as I can tell, there's a lot more to do than the previous one, and NOW I feel like newbies will get to try a few more aspects of the game without feeling lost.
---
But... I might be the exception here.
---
A big problem you're going to have in lowsec is a lot of the seemingly easier fights may be bait for an alt that will come in and blap you. Given your fits and possible skill set right now, your target profile will be other newer pilots. 
---
I jumped quickly up to bs to rat early on, but dropped back down to cruisers and now don't often fly anything bigger. TC3s are great and can do so much. I'm a legion fan boy but a lot of fleets roll with Lokis.

I'm sure you'll get there. There's plenty of great T1 fits to fly too.

That would be absolutely insane. The RL Yamato could fire nine 45 cm / 1.5 ton shells at 500 m/s at it's max effective range (25 km). Rags can shoot 24 rounds of 3.5 m in diameter. Quick napkin math gives me 2k tons (more if using depleted uranium, at 250km/s, that's 140 PN (petanewtons) of kinetic energy, about two thirds of a tsar bomba per round, not taking into account explosive yield. So 16 times the most powerful RL bomb per volley.
---
So yeah, you'd vaporize the city, level the country, and cause an extinction-level impact on each volley with uranium rounds. With nuclear, well... XL rounds are about 50% bigger than tsar bomba.
---
That's a lot of high slots.

Meh, neatly hidden warning to non the wiser pilots

You need to be very active at monitoring zkill when you come across a target. Work out the Corp of the target, kills in system etc and work out if they're solo or not. Even if there's only one dude in local you're engaging, he might have an alt nearby or friends in adjacent systems.
---
1v1 fights are relatively uncommon unless it's some explorer roaming around or someone agreeing to a 1v1 fight. And even if they agree, they might not honour it. This is Eve after all.

---
The new system gives you perfect intel on where someone is actually running sites atm, where new sites are spawning (there are already discord pin bots for new sigs/anoms) and where sites just despawned (have been run by someone or someone closed/opened WH connection)
---
They probably mean against triglav npcs. I doubt they'd actually let players shoot each other.
---
&gt; If left alone, each invasion will also end and move onto other systems on its own after some time.
---
Lame. So not an invasion then just more shit to minmax farm.

My clients are using around 300mb less ram on 64bit than 32bit, while docked, for what its worth. :)
---
I have 64gb though, so I foresee no limitation with the 64bit client.  Inb4 node crash.
---
We've tested it, and right now Concord will respond.  But the invasion system is just "Scouts Reported."  From that article, it appears once it's been invaded, Concord will not respond.  You do get kill rights and they get a sec status hit, but it will be a free for all....

Just saw someone get nuked in one by concord so they def do still

CCP needs to stop catering to the mouth breathing retards that die because they decide to go sightseeing with a full freighter while wardecced.

First answer i make to Hilmar.
---
Stop trying to solve symptom , you will just create more problem and in finality really kill the game. 
---
Solve the root of the problem. And solving the root is a lot more harder, and think to take decision who are in opposite side whith what a lot of people want to do.
---
You mean Twilight Imperium? Yeah, I love that game, but it´s hard to find players who have time for an 6-8 hours board game\^\^
---
Nope, but I'm glad to see the fights happening instead of the turtle and don't fight strategy that NC. suggested they were going to run with.
---
Yes, you will now be able to get them in citadels
---
Just read answer player make to hilmar, and you will understand. Yoour're idea will reduce a symptom by creating other problem.
---
Solve the rootcause it's more important.
---
CCP_Fozzie commented on Suitonia's stream that the support page is saying:
---
Concord will NOT respond to Triglavs attacking your ships.
---
Concord WILL still response to Players attacking your ships.
---
This is to avoid the silly result of Concord (being OP and unkillable) "clearing out" the Invasion for you when they get triggered by an NPC Triglav ship attacking a player.
---
The FOF Raven still works. If you use auto-targeting cruise missiles, it will automatically shoot any enemy in range (as long as you have been previously red-boxed), you don't need to lock them. 
---
Here's a sample fit:
---
    [Raven, FOF Raven]
---
    Ballistic Control System II
---
    Missile Guidance Computer II
---
    Cruise Missile Launcher II
---
    Improved Cloaking Device II
---
    Large Hydraulic Bay Thrusters II
---
    Large Low Friction Nozzle Joints I
---
    Large Polycarbon Engine Housing
---
    Missile Range Script x3
---
    Missile Precision Script x3
---
    Nova Auto-Targeting Cruise Missile x9000
---
Again, make sure you are 400km+ away from the sleepers and that your skills are good enough that your missiles reach further than 400km, otherwise they will burn towards you and destroy your ship (since you have 0 tank). It is pretty slow, but it can even clear C6 combat sites (albeit very slowly).
---
More likely scenario: noone is gonna run them
---
Mmo in general were a huge help with helping me deal with social anxiety. I still struggle face to face, but not nearly as much.
---
And i can attest to not being called out for blunders. I lost in a dragoon to a punisher because i offlined nuets to turn on a salvager after a clean up....
---
Or when i was moving to null to try, lost a bling Abso cause i forgot about gate camps (few weeks back to the game after long hiatus)
---
I am going to echo most though by saying to just try stuff. People come and go in game just like life. And dont feel so alone, plenty of people out there similar
---
They can't even beat Frat lol
---
It was a decent but not much more than average shooter. CCP had very big plans for the link between the two games (influence in fleet fight, boarding hostile ships, etc) but never really followed up on it.
---
It is not about LP for myself. But about LP for people that live in area and will use this LP to get ISK ... and those people will use this ISK to burn stuff in sov around - like in old days.
---
Hit ESC that'll fix it
---
Honestly, 1 GB/client seems fine to me.
---
I have no idea how this can possibly be construed as a positive for the game. Still just as effective for fleeing small engagements, but nerfed into the ground in fleet combat where massed ECM drone plays were engaging, entirely counterable with proper forethought, and subject to serious opportunity costs. 
---
In short, running from solo PvP is just as viable, and a balanced fleet tactic is diminished.
---
Thats dumb. Lore wise concord would not let the trigs just chill in system waiting for us to clear them.
---
Im not saying concord should shoot them. That would be dumb.
---
But the reason concord should not shoot them is because they are no longer in system. This way the free for all we all want materialises.
---
Wait, wait,wait... this means I can get my -10 sec status ass into one of this systems and CONCORD won't attack me? Or just that they won't respond to someone with good sec status shooting at someone but still punish "criminals" that fly by?
---
Blaster without web, outch it s hard.
---
&gt; This is to avoid the silly result of Concord (being OP and unkillable) "clearing out" the Invasion for you when they get triggered by an NPC Triglav ship attacking a player.
---
Not sure who eve though about the idea that it could work that way. I get attacked by NPCs in highsec all the time and no Concords are coming to help.
---
Not sure if it applies in his case, but i did have a bug/glitch occur during the filling out of the form as well that sounds like what might of happened here. I filled everything out and submitted and the screen blinked and looked like it completed, but essentially just erased everything. There was a note on that screen that said to be careful of form time-out, though, it did not specify what it would look like.
---
I decided to fill it out again, since i don't trust it submitted unless i see an actual confirmation screen, especially with the warning about the form time-out. So i filled everything back in again much quicker (copy/pasted) and then when i hit submit, i did get the "your application has been submitted successfully" screen.
---
Its possible he may have mistaken the form time-out for submission? Which it looks like you touched on some in your post.

Afterwards i sent my credentials/pictures to their email address and got a response back as well for confirmation.
---
Damn. Reduce power to the lasers to "boil NC slower" then.
---
You should really welp yourself till you get your first kill, it makes it that much better. Best bet I'd say is getting a bunch of welp ships ready just outside Geminate or in NPC delve and just going at it.
---
Is this displayed while you are in space? So if i have a window top right corner it goes over it... If so... Then dumb...
---
Pic?
---
Jita?
---
Needs a banana for scale.
---
maybe incursions also lead to change how the abyssal space work
---
oh, nice sheet! ty!
---
As a CSM candidate and a ~~Current~~ ~~Former~~  "its complicated" wormhole player myself, this hurts. Having read through most of the CSM posts on the forums, these two players stood out to me as very promising candidates. 
---
having never submitted a CSM application before, I would have liked to see a "application form complete" email and a document received email after completing both parts of the application process. 
---
My best wishes for the campaign of Exooki and all the other players who live in / around wormholes this CSM season
---
Zap
---
invasion...
---
1gb / client looks normal.
---
if you're talking about the incursion, it lowers drone hitpoints.
---
Also, gila drone HP got nerfed in patch..
---
Paint it with tears and blood of fcs receiving question "Can I bring my drake?".
---
Looks like a Vexor was the first victim https://zkillboard.com/kill/76957733/
---
That poor guy...forever known now as first to die
---
Trigonometry invasion
---
Even if you are just at a safe, they will warp onto you.  No combats.
---
Invasion have a goal of permanent occupation.       
---
Incursion is just about "visiting" some space.            
---
Unless something changed Triglavians pull out by them self after like Sansha incursion.         
---
So this is new incursion and not invasion mechanic.
---
You forgot to sine your post
---
That Way you could also allways have your drake on fleet.... even when your salty leader says no
---
Not this patch, but the April one?

Im sorry seeing as how you work for ccp you can fix all the typos on all of their info from this update.

:thinkspin:
---
Getting jammed by drones is not fun pvp, good change imo, ecm drones were becoming the norm for every ship
---
Ccp finally figured out how to get people to use the new map
---
Jamms are a random number generator experience. It’s relatively unique for EvE in that regard. Fozzie himself said they have a hell of a time balancing it.
---
Plenty of powerful EWar options out there without the RNG approach of jamms.
---
and if you still don't see it, make sure you've fully closed your launcher and reopen it. (close it from your system tray)
---
Thats almost like "don't think at ..." and boom someone thought about it ...
---
Lets see how many ppl are trying this now to be like "yap he's right" ...
---
In other words, Goon's fleet was fucked there... :)

So my question is would it be worth checking the box in options under display and graphics called "resource cache enabled" for those of us with 32+ GB systems?
---
I just posted about this on official forum : r/eve
---
i bet you did...
---
Good fights, lots of mistakes but hey never can be too critical when looking at a recording.
---
That said get rid of that twitch laughing pop up screen. Holy shit it's jarring.
---
Advertise your channel at the beginning or end or even in a side bar ad during the video. 
---
Don't kill the immersion you've build by distracting from the action.
---
Who the hecc uses new map anyway smh
---
your flair for seeking attention knows no bounds...
---
Awful idea, but tbh they totally deserve what's coming their way.
---
(fortnight late... but) building capitals for defence, isn't that pretty much POSPY in their C4? :P
---
Is it soloable content or do you need a fleet? and what size?
---
I didn't mind goons invasion of tribute or who they were shooting... But now that you've displayed them as the covenant gassing reach... Idk
---
Nope, but I'm glad to see the fights happening instead of the turtle and don't fight strategy that the newly rebranded CFC suggested they were going with.
---
- Reddit 2016
---
Well shit I dunno what I was thinking of, then. I was even involved with kf recruitment at one point.
---
Nope, it doesn't.
---
Sorry tooni

---
Yeah pretty obvious in this video that you're right
---
Well they probably have virtue sets ;)
---
make triglavian  carrier/dread/titan  with  XXL entropic disintegrators
---
You should put a volume slider on that audio player tho.
---
Just looked at activity in a "border" system.  They seem like FOB rats that have scaled up a notch.
---
No one really cares to argue semantics like this.
---
I feel like, that i am either way too patient with everything or if i am frustrated, i don't blame others, rather then myself, because for whatever reasons i cannot feel the same anger that many others feel against EVE or CCP.
---
Do i play the game wrong? :( Maybe i play a different EVE then everyone else.
---
Tinfoil hat: CCP added this feature just to encourage players to resub so they can downvote Eve daily.
---
Tbh missing texbox where you can type why you liked or disliked overtime in EVE.
---
Play a song on the worlds smallest drake
---
The Atron looks like a storm trooper helmet to me.
---
The Vexor looks like a horses head.
---
Look man, I know you're probably super happy and proud of the fight or whatever, but this is a pointless video of just some anchoring, F1 pushing, and warping around. There's no real substance to it, no story told, nothing. It's not informative or cinematic.
---
Use the footage you have to tell a story instead. Make an intro explaining why you were there, what was at stake (if anything), perhaps an ending battle report, and perhaps include some fleet comms.
---
I am Xenuria and during my term on the CSM I pushed for a UI pointer tool to help new players wipe their own ass properly. I had no idea this very same tool would be a powerful boon to enemies of the imperium and for that I am sorry.
---
ITT: nerds
---
Anyone who lives in null?
---
Jump bridge network display is hella useful.
---
I suggest printing the world smallest paintbrush.
---
Those are the mouth breathing retards that spend big money on plex and skins. Eve isn't for you anymore.
---
Not playing long enough to be a bittervet yet maybe?
---
My favourite question to ask
---
I mean it is working, i'm feeling encouraged.
---
Sounds like someone traumatized them krabs
---
Ok, this is cool, so far it's better than what I expected. How strong are they? Do they scram?
---
Great! Now we have to use 3 maps...
---
you should be sorry for posting
---
2016 is ancient history, mate. Nobody cares.
---
Is that the eve version of 'I like tirtles'?
---
Wait, they have Rorquals in the abyss?
---
It definitely didn't only fail for me, there's at least one other example I have written proof of where a CSM candidate's application went over a hidden character limit and showed a successful submission but was actually errored and had to be manually fixed. While I'm not sure if that specific thing happened to me, the difference is purely that I was on vacation and could not take the additional steps to triple check that everything was okay, the initial error was still on CCP's end in that case though.
---
I'm a simple man. I see a downvote button, I downvote.
---
very funny 5 year old meme
---
is this what it's like to be in the boomer alliance
---
with nothing bigger than a titan, and goons skill injecting into titans, it means they, in the long run are unbeatable.
---
if skill injectors were never a thing less numbers, in better ships could still prevail.
---
goons are useless, they die easily, and when they do because they spike local up to 1k or above each time they think they 'win' all fights. which is funny. because they arnt winning the actual battles, but they are winning a war due to sheer titan numbers, and every scrub can be in one and press f1 nowadays
---
Workaround for maps in broken state - right click in broken map, select "World Map Control Panel - Search", select non-incursion category in Star Map - Stars, select Solar System Map, select Star Map.
---
NB: You can press ESC to get rid of the loading bar that won't go away.
---
Hooray fleet-in-being doctrine.
---
Hardly ranting and raving. Just stating a fact that you seem cowardly. one who won't actually fight other warriors of the Imperium, just go after a few miners.
---
I'm not in PL...Check my Flair.
---
&gt;CCP take no responsibility and no action to rectify the problem.
---
classic, what do you expect
---
I'm not frustrated, so kind of pointless to blame myself or others for something that's not happening.
---
But I do dislike where the development of this game I love is going, and it would be really stupid to blame anyone else but the company that develops it, don't you think?
---
I see the potential this game has, to be what I would consider it's best possible version, and then see how CCP takes the complete oposite direction to either win more money, cater to a different playerbase than the one who has supported them for 16 years, or just because they simply don't play the game and have no clue of how their actions impact the sandbox. It doesn't frustrate me, when I get bored I just play other games, but it is really sad.
---
Got me asking the real questions now as to what Baltec named his character in relation to.
---
That fixes it, up to top with you.
---
You can use pyfa to calculate the m3/hour, factor in some efficiency loss due to your drones, then do the math for each ore type.
---
I always liked the front of the Chimera. If you look straight on you can see Odin standing there.
---
They are not even gonna use this metric for anything, so making us write our reasons only not to read them would be even more pointless.
---
&gt;running from solo PvP is just as viable
---
What if you're the jammed one and you're engaged in solo PVP? Shorter jam cycles means less impact for the jammed, and I've had so many fights deep in structure to tell you that 15 seconds can make one absolute hell of a difference.
---
Far as I can tell it is already painted.
---
You were a little ahead of us rolling the toggle out to release :)  It's there now
---
"the game is dead now. on the other hand i can finally join doctrine fleets" - unironically some redditer
---
So they are ridiculously overpowered? O.o
---
Can't tell for sure ... it's like looking old ... for everyone it starts at a different time ... so my "many years" might still be not enough like your "many years" :)
---
Mega lag in Jita. I already logged off and downvoted.
---
fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you good sir i hope you have a wonderful day
---
Would be more funny if the joke hadn't been said for the last 2 weeks here already.
---
Delete your account.
---
Pretty sure you were doing it wrong. I think lvl 1 skills can find it.
---
Use 8 probes. Use the Pinpoint formation.
---
After each scan make the probe formation smaller. And re-center it over the anomaly 
---
Boom. Scanned.
---
Just know enemy fleet FC, and name it Fleet Cyno : XXXXX
---
The complaint was always that the losing party would use EC drones to break point and warp away. Doesn't matter if the effect lasts 5 seconds or 50, once lock is broken, the other party is free to warp off.
---
My video editing software isn't the best and I can't do those awesome text pop-ups that other YouTubers do...#feelsbadman

NC didn't want it anyway....
---
Ha! It should be. I was going to post about how you can create your own 'new content' by trying different setups and engagement strategies but I was too tired to bother, and I realised the OP probably wasn't referring to solo PVP anyway.
---
There are poeple still using the old map? Oh right, average age is high in this game 😉
---
Easier to beat NCdock than a dead horse...
---
3D print a small paintbrush.
---
Considering the trailer literally states that this is "Chapter 1" in Triglavian, they might as well just be incursioning around before invading. Nothing special to see here
---
[So unoriginal it hurts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/btz71u/i_heard_a_rumor_that_ccp_released_special_version/)

Not sure why you’re getting downvoted. I agree, and I think it was hyped in a way that implied this.
---
The mighty warriors dropping Titan on T1 frigates? Are we talking about the same elite pvpers?
---
https://imgur.com/a/7fcrpLC

Fascinating. Between "NC docks" and "PL is dead" you guys have managed to sustain yourselves on the same two jokes for nearly a year!
---
The new map is shit for pvp.
---
but why
---
The JB network is also visible in the old map.
---
i wish we could have nice things....
---
wow, haven't seen an unironic "no you" post in a while
---
u knu nuting!
---
There is already a DED lp store with trig data cores and skillbooks . Unclear how to get the lp for it though
---
I mean, who's to say they aren't planning on sticking around? I don't see these ending like Incursions - and if you look at any structures in system, they seem to almost have some sort of huge Trig target mark over them~
---
Simple, you get CCP to make a skin based on the 3D print. Tada! No need to colour it!
---
I believe a  Republic Fleet Target Painter is the proper tool.
---
We would be joking about their PvP skills. If we had a chance to withess them during that year. 
---
Well, shit....
---
The horse is dead, it doesn't mind.
---
Maybe hope we get actual rewards because right now I dont think they even have bounty ticks.
---
Ah, thank you.
---
I enjoy the style or story telling. I haven't bothered to fact check but I hope you enjoyed your fight goon guy
---
It's shit for many things, including pvp.
---
Disagree entirely, Vince got tackled and they used that to deep dick the rest of the fleet. I see plenty of substance.
---
Realtalk I keep losing my drones window and need help.
---
Yes, it spawns a corvette and boards it.   If you already have one, it boards the one you have.
---
Paint? What you have to do is ask if you can bring it.
---
so, another part of the UI that I will never touch.
---
Interesting use of the Dev team.
---
"You have an active war declaration, are you sure you want to undock ?"
---
(and never show this dialog again, that is bugged and can't be selected)
---
Br please
---
well maybe you would get more fights if you get rid of your "only deploy when we can bring at least 4 times more people than our enemy" doctrine.....
---
I haven't logged in for months, wasn't there a 1k player, 80b subcap brawl literally yesterday?
---
In the description of the video pal
---
Today it is funny.... but without any reward for all participants… tomorrow everybody is back in 0.0 krabbing \^\^
---
So far all we really know is that it’s like incursions, and incursions go to nullsec, so probably.
---
You mean the one employed in World War Bee? I remember only shooting structures.
---
Or they camp you on the other side thus allowing krabs to safely mine again
---
Yeah :/
---
Well, what can i say to that....
---
Other than that the CCP buff definitely helped. :D
---
We had a plex sale yesterday, they are not going to discount omega straight after.

Ah.

The scalene triangle.
---
I feel like I could break it just looking at it.
---
Don’t you know, 64 bit pointers are twice as bitty as 32 bit pointers
---
That sounds like it's caching to RAM not storage, so unless you have a page file on your SSD I don't think the SSD matters.
---
it most likely is
---
Very likely it will work kind of like in incursions, where you get LP for finishing the new invasion sites. It´s a way to reward players without seeding more ISK into the system
---

Just make yourself a hypotenuse and grab a chair to hang around with.
---
I'm not a UI designer, but it looks ugly as hell. Why couldn't they make those buttons of the same size as "Close window" and "Log Off"?
---
To make it less confusing for NC?
---
Hey, hold on just a secant...
---
No bounties and most drops are scrap metal that I have seen so far. Some have said they got the new m-plasma's but none of the drops I could get to had anything shinny.
---
Many many players ships going pop, mine included twice. Literally insta-pop with a pretty decent tank.
---
I've seen a Rattlesnake,  Paladin and an Astarte got pop on a single wave this afternoon.
---
Was very much good fun thought :)
---
Friends say its not just me
---
yeah, DDR4 3200 has an average transfer speed of around 30 gb/s...so this setting being enabled sounds like it would be better for me, but I am still not entirely sure what this setting actually does. Sounds like it just puts resources on to your ram rather then reading the resources from a hard drive, adding to memory usage.
---
It's going to blow your mind when you discover you can take a wormhole to day trip some of that stuff
---
More like 1dq1
---
If the sov map isn't entirely triglavian by the end of the year, i will consider this expansion a failure.
---
If he isn't capable and able to stand up for himself on something as trivial as this, then he may not be a good pick for CSM.
---
these slow response times are present in the 32Bit client too, from my experience at least
---
I mean there is a large difference between the "politics around an election", and the current issue that I face. The second it happened I went through every available channel that I could and tried to get a handle on the situation, and clearly the support that I've garnered thus far would go against the idea that I have no passion/drive/charisma. I've got no issue debating/considering drastically different viewpoints to my own but picking a one on one fight with CCP because I didn't get the result I wanted seems insanely counterproductive to what I want to accomplish. The whole strength of a good CSM member is an ability to work with CCP, and as such I only responded politely/cordially and the CCP rep that I talked to was nothing but responsive/communicative. The answers themselves may not have felt great, but there's no benefit to hostility.
---
I like the new UI. It looks vaguely professional.

 Gtfo of a wh then. Ez

Right, but why?

It's almost as if CCP never intended for wormholes to be a thing.

I did until I saw this.
---
Suddenly in Jita in my Iteron Mk III.
---
&gt;but I'm glad to see the fights happening instead of the turtle and don't fight strategy that NC. suggested 
---
Looking at that BR you should widot and bring more people next time because double their numbers appearantly isn't enough to not get wrekt by them.
---
Missing the point
---
You have SLYCE’s vote to support human rights and human players in game not bot rights.

Mine is the same, looks like nothing is happening than a minute later it launches
---
I've said it before, but it deserves to be said again. Whoever the artist at CCP is that made this image good fucking job.
---
"New" map sucks. Badly.
---
I could see making this for only adjacent systems but all? It's quite dumb. I also think being able to Cargo scan the exploration cans is also bad. It's not exploration if you are able to cherry picker everything.
---
Is this a complaint?
---
Isn't that kind of the whole point of living in a WH?
---
Isn't not having any of those quality of life things what you WH players call "hardmode" or "real EVE"?
---
Yea for sure. I only ask cuz this shit happens all the time. Eve regularly ignores me. Usually results in deanchoring but im not even in space yet!
---
I mean, panfam completely stomped on battleships with ADC hacs and won a fight. The outcome on this could have been predicted before the fight took place, but I'm super happy to see them bringing fights. What more do you want?
---
The Leshaks have 8!! Looks nutty
---
Yeah I don't know if that was the only complaint. I've had semi-honorable PVP battles where the DPS loss from a successful cycle was the significant factor determining the outcome of the fight.
---
Faction Warfare is like a giant war too...
---
You still can't bring it.
---
So my question is sort of question, sort of looking for advise.
---
I'm a long time players, but I haven't played in a year or so.  My main character was last in WH space with a bunch of equipment in a player station for the Corp I was in.  I'm certain I'm no longer in the Corp, and I believe the character isn't actually in WH space at the moment.  I think I have a jump clone for the station... no idea if the station is still even there.  
---
Now it was a few billion in ships, so I was hoping to at least try to recover a few if possible, but I don't even know where to begin.  To be honest, the thought of dealing with it and not knowing what to do, has made it so I haven't even wanted to return to the game to try.  So what advise would you give me on this please?  If I cannot get into the station, I'd imagine I would just have to cut my losses?  What ways could I save a few things?  What happens if the station is no longer there?  Isn't there some sort of recovery system?
---
Appreciate any advise and suggestions you all have.  I was silly and put in billions into joining up into WH space and then had to move and deal with life.  My anxiety over it has prevented me from even attempt to log in.  Thankfully I do have ISK to get back on my feet, but it would be a hard hit to take.  Thanks!
---
Oh another note. Apparently they added t2 trig parts that are in the amarr section. GJ ccp
---
👎
---
true but it would be nice if we are at least able to access the pages and read the info on there, i mean just because agents, incurstions, pirate strongholds and ore belts (this is the place where you can get an overview of which ore contains what minerals) are not present in j-space doesn't mean that i'm not interested in them
---
some of that information is useful even without direct access to the sites
---
i too would like to know this
---
Yes. Previously, 32bit EVE clients could only use 4GB of RAM, regardless of option selection. Now they can use more. They may not use more, but now the underlying architecture is not the reason it can't/won't.
---
Context: https://live.engadget.com/2008/05/28/commodore-gaming-offers-eve-online-themed-desktop-pcs/
---
i dont get it. 1gb per eve is pretty amazing in 2019, hell deusex takes 12gb of system and 5gb of gpu...
---
Good thing there is a new tool that will let you highlight it for me.
---
All good points Ron. I experienced the same. One thing I will say though is that the market and fitting windows seem much snappier at loading
---
There is that.
---
My issue with a post like this is that none of my communications with the CCP CSM rep were anything but responsive/cordial, they answered all my questions and while I may not have been happy with the answers I am not the type to rally up outrage about something like this. I didn't get to where I was by being inflammatory, I just listen and occasionally argue a lot. I fundamentally do not think that picking a fight with CCP is what people should look for in a CSM.
---
Life... Ugh... Finds a way
---
Literally just went through this submitted a ticket about it.
---
it looks surprisingly unexploded and uninvited to a fleet
---
Mine wouldn't log in, but it worked immediately after opening and closing the New Eden Store
---
I'm not on one side or the other. But the strategy of NC is sensible. Asymmetric battles well done can unbalance an enemy, that would enter into a war of attrition I do not know if they are in a position to maintain
---
Be careful... He's a hero
---
If you had already injected your entire SP to get to where you wanted to go, as a lot of people have. Cheaper to just sub once injected every few weeks and not all the time. Inject a new character to a carrier and just sub when you want to play not 24/7/365.
---
Logged in a few hours ago, launcher stopped recognizing I was logged in, that's when it knew it was time to dock up

Whats with the new set of lights around citadels with Trig symbols on them?

We werent blue balling.  We were responding to H1Z  pings.

everything is delayed by 30s to a minute for me. logging in, finding a fleet, joining a fleet.

Make sure you keep watching after he closes, they put in a blooper reel at the end.
---
Why get more RAM when you can [download more](https://youtu.be/wsO-Td0hqXo)!! 😉
---
Go Omega. Another option that works really well is to uninstall the game.
---
I think checked up on is probably a better word than hustled, although Red is very... aggro with everything so strong wording goes hand in hand here. When he says he pushed me to run, mainly I had a lot going on with WHSOC and the idea of running for CSM was something that I'd played around with but didn't really think I had a chance in hell at so it was just kind of brushed off. He pushed me to give it a shot, that's all.
---
He wasn't the only person that was angry with the situation when I went to the various groups/communities to tell them the information I'd received after I reached out to CCP, he's just the one that ended up posting the thread. I don't like the idea of hustling CCP, it seems counterproductive to what I'm trying to accomplish by running for CSM, but I can't stop people from voicing their opinions.
---
[got my vote](https://i.imgur.com/39CGDGb.png)
---
Testing these on the 32 bit as well, and seeing the same thing.
---
Just some pro tips, if you do intend on properly painting it, use proper miniatures paints.
---
Standard store bought paints will have large pigments that will clog the details. Army Painter, Vallejo Model colour, and Citadel are all brands I can recommend.
---
I would also suggest priming it to make the paint stick better. Army painter and citadel primers will do. Automotive primers will be quite thick, and will clog detail if you are not careful.
---
When painting it, it is far better to thin your paints and use multiple thin coats, at least 2. This will result in a smoother finish and keep the details nice and sharp.
---
Head on over to the r/minipainting sub if you want to learn more.
---
If you want just a simple paint scheme for the drake, using just a couple of citadel paints that will be REALLY easy, and look good, do the following.
---
This will be going for a caldari blue steel look.
---
Base coat the model in leadbelcher. (This is a metallic paint that will be used as the main colour).
---
Wash the model with Nuln Oil. (This applies an inky later that collects in the recesses and creates the dark contrasts. It will also matte down the model).
---
Lightly Dry Brush the model with Necron Compound. ( This will pick out the edges and add a bit of shine back to the metal and complete the contract with high lights).
---
OPTIONAL
---
Apply a thinner layer of Guilin an blue to the model. (This will add a slightly blued steel hue to the model, like the Caldari steel).
---
Use white, red or green dots of paint to add lights as you see fit.
---
Have a look at Lightworks, the free version is pretty much all you'll ever need.
---
time to actually use the ram i got ages ago and never use.
---
You mean they never intended for people to live out of them full time
---
We already have plenty of random CSM candidates tyfm.
---
Bothers me that even CCP calls it "in wormholes." You're not Ina wormhole. A wormhole is a connection. You're in wormhole space or jspace or unknown space or Anakois
---
Convenient lol
---
PI needs even more clicking as the PI structures are sometimes unclickable until you rotate the view juuust right.
---
I've never done those. It always seem like the agency rewards or whatever is garbage. The only useful thing about it is that it makes me freak out thinking I lost my ship while killing sleepers when I'm watching shows. I guess they have to make bounties or mining more appealing.

I havent had the guts to undock in this lag yet so lol

Been trying to find the new trig parts tho.. Really hope they dont jist spawn in abyss space.
---
These are some amazing tips, friend. I'll do another print and give everything that you've said a try!
---
I've already given this one a very quick zap with some primer to protect the resin, it's normally a translucent green that you can't see any detail on.
---
Do Trig all day at work, don't need it at play.

X if you should consider using a different adjective in your title

X if you're not playing on a toaster and things run fine
---
I have kind of a sour taste in mouth when I see people dunking on NC. for going for what looks like the most appropriate strategy given their situation. Especially when up against the biggest and most turbosafekrabbing coalition. Which you can't really complain about as well because it's an efficient thing to do to establish and maintain power if the opportunity is there.
---
More like the Grazing of Tribute because you fat cows went there to get dunked lmao

X if p.c. and general social justice whiteknightery should reach this sub at some point

I disagree in that this fight is what you need to have in order to even maybe make it to the CSM. This is a fight you need to have.
---
I don't get it. Is there a feedback window when you upvote or downvote? What the hell are they gonna do about such information-less feedback, if they'll do anything in the first place?
---
yeah thats the one!
---
It's also really the only way to keep it fair. Imagine having to split the loot for every site.

&gt;Character Selection Screen takes about 10 seconds to launch after clicking the character  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Fleet Window takes about 10 seconds for available fleets to come up  
---
&gt;Clicking join in Fleet window takes another 10 seconds or so before you get the invite to join  
---
&gt;Clicking a character pops up the window and the portrait and name load .. the detail window, including corporation, etc , takes about 10 seconds to load.
---
have this in the old 32bit client as well
---
The slow responses seem just like the somewhat usual post patch server cancer.
---
the battleship fleet could barrely move anywhere with the fortizar bombing it dealing damage and draining cap, it was a fun fight tho.

I lost a bhaalgorn, instantly reshipped into another one and rejoined just like many others did so you will see some names a few times on that battle report.

Something is broken. If I am reading right there are 10 minutes old outstanding calls waiting for response from the server.
---
i mean, if the battleships wernt bubbling themselves, they could of repositioned to somwhere a bit better. and the fleet stayed literally stationary, no tracking aiding movements or trying to move away to reduce bomb accuracy. you just stayed there, no matter what. dying like flies. merely only killing the munins that wernt up to the task of broadcasting quick enough.

True, what hes having is propably not lag

I've had upwards of a minute on the ingame character related stuff. Interestingly the right click menu still works fine even tho the selected item window is fucked
---
At least i can enjoy the game now until the server is gone v0v the problem arnt the skill injectors, if ccp wouldn't allow to have 100acc/person there would have never been such an abuse... So are skill injectors good? Most likely not but its the community who made them "game killing"

PSA: Don't switch clients if you have important shit to do. Switching to 64 bit resets pretty much everything, so deploying the tried and tested workarounds, finding those old overview settings and resizing/pinning windows will be a theme of your first few log in attempts.
---
This has been a meme for way longer than this war.
---
I mean at it's core I'll fully admit that the time I was most comfortable with my position in the CSM running was when Loro was #1 and I was #2. I thought that gave a good balance between high/low representation and I think our personalities complemented each other really well.
---
That being said, Braxus is hugely understating my knowledge base here and I'd be very surprised if people that I've talked to on a regular basis would come away from the conversation thinking that I had no clue what I was talking about. I do all the fittings for WHSOC, and have been an insanely active member of the WH community since VITA formed and joined the fray, and in that time I've absorbed/took notes on every piece of information I could for the express purpose of being able to look at proposed changes from a variety of perspectives. To think that people need to be a C5 resident in order to be aware of the high class meta is patently absurd, and in the same way I can't perfectly articulate every single high class concern the same would be true of them not being able to voice the concerns of the rest of WH space without putting the same amount of legwork that I have into it.
---
when will people learn that until ccp put in valuable and interactable pve content the best way to play eve is to exploit and take it from other people
---
Guess we will need to give it a day or two as usual before CCP works out the bugs from launch. Not surprising we all know this is how things go.
---
I know of no one in null that uses it.
---
the bubble i think had a reason to be there, to keep booshers from having it too easy maybe but i'm not really sure we were somewhat moving but from your perspective its like a snail.
---
decisions were made, fun was had, need to do these things more often.
---
Thanks for the good fight :)
---
Don't forget the lack of worthwhile promo ever since the "this is eve" trailer came out, what, 5 years ago?
---
I was more talking about that they won´t have bounty ticks. And sure, why not, give them loot. Worked so well with the NPC  Sotiyos, didn´t it? ;-)
---
me: 
---
*Megas should trade pretty efficiently with munins on paper. What happened?*
---
:open killmails, see bombers:
---
*ah.*
---
Every time a Goon posts something like this, you can tell they're pissed. Just another step towards convincing CCP of their broken game mechanics.
---
And?
---
Like, seriously, is this supposed to have a point?
---
It's doing the same for me and when searching for fleets
---
You can progress solo just fine.  
---
Just be prepared to be ganked if you carry to much valuables or go to the wrong places.
---
CCP needs to be sent a message. Goons are just the carrier, if that makes you feel better.
---
I'd also like to report another bug, I can't blue the triglavians

Thanks, yeah I have about 11m sp moved into wh space a mouth ago, Thanks for the help

Tinfoil hat time:
---
A dev saw part of [this talk by the Subnatica dev](https://youtu.be/fkjY_R7zQsM?t=865) on telemetry systems and user feedback and this is their way of putting it into the game.
---
Its not like youre using the space for anything else?
---
So this is an odd point in the whole thing, from talking to different candidates it doesn't seem like all of them got emails regarding this. And CCP's own wording when talking to me made it sound like sending an email was a feature that they were looking to add in the future, not one that currently exists.
---
Not saying Blazing didn't get an email, just that it doesn't seem standardized.
---
I would be very surprised if it's "snappier".  Maybe just perception?  Unless the beta has other bug fixes in.  I expect there's some instrumentation in it which would slow it down rather than speed it up, as it's a beta.  
---
Anyway I didn't really notice much of a difference.  Got to wait for a big subcap battle to really see it die.
---
https://youtu.be/fkjY_R7zQsM?t=865 check out what subnatica devs did with it.
---
Assuming the next expansion is meant to get a lot of talk generated about the game they're probably explicitly looking for data from new players but getting baseline data now from older players.
---
last time the launcher forgot my accounts I just couldn't be assed into logging them all in again
---
i've yet to play since, since the barrier to playing again is 25 minutes of forced 2fa verification codes
---
From anywhere in eve I can tell if there's a sig to scan in any other specific system that I choose without ever undocking.....really embracing the feel of exploration with this one, at least limit it to region wide or something
---
Logged in just fine, logged out and started the launcher again. It's lost all my account info. Same as usual. Broken.
---
Nice
---
I'll clearly state that it's very much me being cautious with that, because 1% isn't 0% and losing my account would be a lot more devastating to me than the current situation. That does open up some ability for me to provide proof though so if people ask for specifics I'll definitely be more open to the idea.
---
I have another comparison that hasnt much to do with a flashlight
---
Even if it's several days, you should be in contact with some sort of recruiter (or director in case of smaller corps) from the get-go more or less, and you should be able to ask them about updates instead of on reddit. Sounds like OP's prospective corp is ded.
---
Just to clarify Fall of Reach = Halo prequel book that covers the creation of the first round of Spartans up to to beginning of the first game, First Strike bridges the gap between Halo 1 and 2. Ghosts of Onyx is part of the same storylines and happens a bit later.
---
That's talking about anomalies not signatures which is what this post is about.

Fall of Reach was prequel to Halo 1, First strike bridge 2 and 3, Ghosts of Onxy follows the same characters a bit later

---
I know it sounds strange for the people of Reddit, but most gamers have no interest in writing many-worded screeds about their game experience. CCP already has plenty of data about player behavior; they know you play in hisec or in nullsec, that you mined or explored or did PVP, that you're an omega or alpha, that you've been playing for ten years or two weeks. A simple qualitative yes/no about whether that player enjoyed playing whatever experience they've chosen in EVE is 1) not a burdensome response for the player to provide, and 2) gives CCP some way of tracking player satisfaction against certain game experiences.

Stealing someone else's AAR: We formed to kill the fort, we killed the fort. We started burning back to staging when we heard that FRT found Elo and managed to waken him from the slumber.  Elo formed eagles and jumped into 46DP via gate, into a mini rage cage. We burned back and started engaging with all formed fleets. Werte not reliably breaking shit, so carriers and some XiX supers were dropped, + 2 boson titans. Not a lot of the eagle fleet survived to disengage, a bit of confusion on our side as FC crashed and dictors got hazed off a bit. 
---
Considering how well Elo usually flies, current theory is a morale welp because wow that was a crazy thing to jump into.

I was really hoping for random abyssal rifts to open and triglavians come pouring out, killing players, reffing upwell structures, entosising sov, and returning to their abyssal space. And occasionally anchoring whatever structure thing that had been hyped about if they weren’t dealt with in a timely manner.

I feel like that button should increase in size once every 10 minutes you stay docked.   By the time it hits 3 hours the entire screen should be just one large undock button.

---
Still useful for resetting leshak ramp up that’s shooting your caps.  And yes, escaping. So the only real nerf is the time that subcap logi is jammed in a fleet fight, but your still interrupting cap chain and messing up reps. Not a huge nerf I don’t think.

you'd think a WH Corp CEO would know how to spell Anoikis.

Speaking of things that are popular in PvP, T2 weapons can now be fitted to faction, officer and storyline ammunition.

seems like it's serverside then and wouldn't be impacted by client (32 or 64 bitness)

&gt; Character Selection Screen takes about 10 seconds to launch after clicking the character
---
Present in both 32 and 64 bit clients. However, for me at least, it takes sometimes up to 40 seconds from clicking character to actually getting in.
---
I wish this sub would get used for this kind of thing more often!  This thread brought me much enjoyment
---
My friend, your stuff is gone since the day you put it in a WH, you have to accept this. Moreover, you took a break without evacuate your asset.  
---
Breaks are Ok of course, everyones take breaks, WH guys too. But you need to move your stuff before.  
---
If yours ships are still there, it's pure luck, or the Bob's will.
---
We do, but it's rare we actually catch those slippery little buggers!
---
Well, the items below that are supposed to be at the top of the screen, so if that is there everything else is lower on the screen, thus taking space that I do use.
---
Seems pretty basic I know, but you don't seem like a very smart person, so I hope the really evident explanation helps.
---
For people who can't view it:
---
&gt;As part of the celebrations around the launch of EVE Online: Invasion, we’re delighted to announce that the opt-in open beta for the 64-bit EVE Online client is now live!   
---
&gt;The transition to a 64-bit client is a huge technical milestone in the sixteen-year development history of EVE Online, and we’re super excited to be able to offer this open beta as we finalize testing and development of the new client.  
---
&gt;It’s been incredible to see how the much community has embraced testing for the new client so far, and we’d like to give a huge thank you to everyone who’s assisted with live testing on Singularity as well as bug reporting and discussion of the new client and its performance.  
---
&gt;**HOW DO I GET INVOLVED?**  
---
&gt;If you’d like to take part in the 64-bit open beta, it’s pretty simple. You’ll just need to switch over your launcher to download the 64-bit version of the EVE Online client.  
---
&gt;**To do this, please follow these instructions:**  
---
&gt;First, click the "E" icon in the top right of you launcher, as shown below:
---
&gt; Next, select “settings” from the dropdown menu, as highlighted in the following image: 
---
&gt;You’ll then see a popup window with a series of checkboxes. Simply check the option to "run clients with 64-bit", as indicated below, and click okay. 
---
&gt;Congratulations, the launcher will now download the 64-bit client for you to take part in the open beta. Please be aware that if you do experience any issues, you can always switch back to the 32-bit client.  
---
&gt;**HOW DO I PROVIDE FEEDBACK?**  
---
&gt;Part of the reason that we’ve been able to deliver a 64-bit open beta ahead of schedule is due to the incredible support we’ve received from the community during testing on Singularity.  
---
&gt;All the bug reporting, discussion and flagging of issues has paid off, so be sure to provide bug reports and information on any issues you encounter.  
---
&gt;Here’s a couple of resources that’ll assist you with the EVE Online 64-bit open beta:

I don't know you, and I don't think a person has to live in C5 space to be a good WH CSM.  But I do want a WH candidate to understand rolling holes (with caps and subcaps), the various common doctrines, how to use FAXes in WH space (and the associated problems with FAX use), how to farm high class sites, including the drifter and through the use of caps (and why the high class sites are in a bad place right now).  If you can do all of those things, good.  If not, you need to crack the books and get learnin' before you'll be a good WH CSM candidate.

This is CCP we are talking about, 2000's developers approaching 2020's while forgetting the good bits of the 2000's that their game provided. The devs of deleting boot.ini, capital proliferation, not thinking closely enough how to combat citadel proliferation, WoD, PS only DUST 514, cancelled VR projects, cancelled Nova because its not good enough, too Icelandic-centric and a constant infatuation with dumbing down a formerly hardcocre game.
---
hey i can see falcon's boobs... (^-^)
---
Ihubs are reinforced by individuals who have nothing else to do while multiboxing their rorquals and supers.
---
They just create potential timers for newbee fcs to fight for.
---
On the other side, those ihubs have a Toyota strategic value to your eyes and each uncontested timer appear to you as a great victory. Good for you, hopefully we'll get a true war and not only you moving away under the pressure again.

I very much agree with that, I don't think I would have garnered all the support that I did from both high and low class WH space if I didn't know those things.
---
You don't get them identified. Just a count.
---
Everytime I open the launcher now it seems like a dice roll whether my accounts are going to be there. I don't know if that's something with the update itself or the 64 bit. But yeah, going great so far.
---
That's what happens when you piss off krabbers, NC may have better PvP skills, but it seems they can't afford the fight at the scale krabbers can push.
---
Unknown of what the setting fully does, but from personal experience having it enabled helps stop some stuttering when undocking and using gates. It doesn't really add much RAM usage on top of the client already, so I just keep it enabled.
---
But that is from my own personal experiences.
---
I know there a thread for doing this but is it possible to make an easy way to share your overview &amp; UI setting between accounts?
---
Finding the hidden files and going through the change of the update is a pain in the ass.
---
The disparity in numbers was about the same it was the whole game vs goons. Now it is goons vs panfam.

No you don’t.  I see it on the release branch.

It's broken and doesn't give an accurate report. Sometimes it gives a wildly inaccurate one.

---
Step 1: Limit number of supers that can be stored in a keepstar, probably based on max volume.
---
Step 2: Tackle structure proliferation by debuffing structures based on nearby structures. This could be in the form of a bonus applying more strongly when a keepstar is the only one in the constellation, for example. 
---
Here's an example, not thoroughly thought out with some back-of-envelope math:
---
*Idea: We want to prevent supercap proliferation. Essentially, make it more hassle to own too many supers again. At the same time, we want to make keepstars more meaningful targets for conflict.*
---
Keepstars receive new limits to restrict super storage, maximum volume and maximum mass that can be stored in the super storage.
---
Basic numbers:
---
Titan volume range: 100-155 million m³
---
Titan mass range: 2.1-2.4 million tons
---
Super volume range: 51-62 million m³
---
Super mass range: 1.6-1.78 million tons
---
So we can think about a base of 310 million m³, allowing 2 Avatars OR 5 Aeons OR 3 Ragnaroks  OR 6 Hels and so on.
---
As for mass, we want to encourage supercarrier use over titan use so we'd want to make sure that mass isn't the limitng factor for supercarrier storage, something like:
---
Base maximum of 10 million tons for super storage. That's barely enough for 6 Hels or 6 Nyxes, but you can only squeeze 5 Wyverns in there.
---
So now we can store a couple of supers in the keepstar. To encourage storing more supers over more titans as space increases, we just adjust the bonuses so that they don't help titan storage as much:
---
\+2 million tons and +80 million m³ of storage for every system in the constellation that **doesn't** have a keepstar.
---
So in a constellation of 6 systems with one keepstar you'd get:
---
710 million m³ and 20 million tons. That's enough for 4 Avatars OR 11 Aeons OR 7 Ragnaroks OR 12 Hels (missing 1.45 billion tons for the 13th Hel so a Nyx doesn't fit either) and so on...
---
Obviously these numbers need some serious tweaking but this kind of methodology would go a long way it making it a hassle to own supers again, Obviously there needs to be external structure proliferation considerations to make this idea work, but one way to deal with that here is to set the base limit so low that only a single supercarrier will fit in a keepstar in a populated constellation. Heck, maybe that isn't such a bad idea:
---
Base becomes 75 million m³ and 2 million tons. Now you can fit any supercarrier and no titan.
---
If we want to be complete asses and Make Titans Great Again we can gimp the storage so that you only even get 1 Titan's worth of storage at full constellation bonus. Maybe even go batshit crazy and split the bays into titan storage and super storage and make it so that you only start with 2.5 million tons in the titan storage so Titans are hard capped at one per keepstar unless its bonused (and it should be better to have just the one keepstar to maximize storage space for Titans). If we go that route, you can make the supercarrier storage as large as you want. Maybe a 5 or 10 to 1 ratio isn't too bad, even though volume wise we are between 2 and 3 to one, depending on whether we are comparing Avatars at 155 or Ragnaroks at 100.
---
Do tell. I only use fleetcom because of the gun to my head, if I can get away from it all the better.
---
There seems to be a acceleration gate everywhere. Can those ships go through acceleration gates?
---
Well, now you can always bring your Drake...
---
It maybe be weird, but i understand better the new map instead the old one.
---
In a players mind that's "fair", and even if a person is ahead they can still feel that they learn something. Usian Bolt beating you in a race where you both start at the same line is "fair", but Usian Bolt winning a race against you where he was already 3 miles ahead? Well why even try?
---
Thinking that the elite pvp playstyle is superior to the industry/asset accumulation playstyle.
---
Most corps tried to foster an 'elite pvp' attitude and actively harassed krabs/industry people out of their corp.
---
Guess where those krabs went? Goons, of course.
---
Tengus can do 5/10+ DED sites.
---
Feature you now have to go find incursions the old fashion way, and breaking the map adds that extra damages.
---
Literally UNPLAYABLE.
---
A joke, it was.
---
Perhaps the downvoting wave is causing the lag in the first place.
---
The best thing to come out of this patch so far.
---
Havent seen any scram. I only tested out a "light" effect system and they were rough... stronger than T1 abyssal lol (only ones I've really done).
---
Absolutely need coordination.
---
Does it only come up for Omegas though or Alphas too?
---
its live since 5 hours, go away with your karma whoring.
---
Pearl Abyss aren't to blame this is the usual CCP dick-fuckery,
---
I wanna do level 1 sites and things like that. I am talking about simple stuff.
---
I'm living your dream, I can't even remember my last launcher problem.
---
I don't really play anymore but here's 5 steps that should help you familiarise yourself with PvP
---
1) Watch some Suitonia, Zarvox, etc. on youtube. Get some ideas for frigates/dessies you like the sound of flying. Keep it cheap and small for now. Cheap allows you to die many more times before you need to top up your funds and keeping it small allows you to both get around quickly and hopefully avoid situations where you just end up getting blobbed unnecessarily. 
---
2) Buy and fit 20-50 of said frigates. Understand (or ask other pvpers) what your engagement profile is - what is your 'ideal match up' and what the worst thing you could come across. Look for the former, avoid the latter.
---
3) Familiarise yourself with Fw space in lowsec -Use Zkillboard and the ingame map (average pilots in system/number of ships killed) to find systems with 'some' activity, avoid systems that have gate camps or fleets around where possible for now.
---
4) Die many times. Each time stop and ask....what did I do wrong? What did I do right? and what can I improve next time? (Record and rewatch if you can).
---
5) Rinse and repeat. Somewhere between ship 5 and ship 50 you'll likely kill something - Voila your first kill.
---
Finally find yourself a group either in Fw space, null or wormholes that accept and teach newbro's- don't be afraid to try out many groups until your find a corp culture that appeals to you. The right group will help show you the way and will accelerate your learning.
---
Don't forget eve is a game, so make sure you're having some fun. If you find a group obsessed with killmails and performance and being a try hard doesn't appeal to you then kindly tell them to fuck off and find another group of players that suits your tastes.
---
I personally recommend Pandemic Horde if you are an individual that can take the initiative and make the most of opportunities that present themselves. But there are many other groups out there that are full of interesting and experienced players willing to help you find your feet.
---
Good luck!
---
its just so anoing, when you have to ligin fast and dont remember to pick the right profile and all mods and drones are not in the right spot and all settings/ov are gone
---
so you have to pick othere to relog and switch profie or stay and fight aor whatever you logged in to do
---
Guess EvE will die then and CCP can go back to making mobile phone games that are profit making.
---
&gt;rage cage
---
&gt;current theory is a morale welp because wow that was a crazy thing to jump into.
---
&gt;We're not reliably breaking shit, so carriers and some XiX supers were dropped, + 2 boson titans.
---
1515022, it doesnt forget them often, usually only when theres a bug update. Launcher updated when i was online ( some white table/window - didnt read just clicked ok or something), so might be that.
---
Watching nc. and ph retreat to the drone lands thinking that they’re safe is quite funny. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30001118/201905272200/
---
I don't know what to tell you but yeah for your fight it does seem broken, I know /u/squizz changed the API around startTime/endTime for zkill recently might be that whoever maintains it needs to fix their implementation.
---
&gt; I'm not a UI designer 
---
History has proven that the CCP UI team isn't, either.
---
It's not about affording fights and losses, no one is retarded enough to just throw away their supers and keepstars against a vastly larger invading force. For example, goons were evicted from the north after crabbing for years and didn't just whelp their super fleet for no reason
---
I suggest a good acetone clearcoat.  Really make the true colors pop!
---
You have been woefully misinformed.
---
I guess that's ok on the anomalies front. Still will make sig hunting a lot faster, yay I guess.
---
how many accounts?
---
It's probably for the best.
---
truth
---
Why don't you check the patch notes instead of asking someone to do it for you.
---
But he's not a WH CEO.
---
I wanna do like 1 sites and things like that
---
Maybe if you have dementia.
---
As someone who's lost ships to wardecs before whether due to ineptitude or being sleepy or whatever on a given day, I for one like this change a lot and I'm happy it's in the game.
---
your salt is delicious
---
Personally, I really like the new map... It has virtually the exact same functionality and looks really nice. I just wish the lines between stars were a lot brighter (and not just in the constellation I'm in).
---
I'll see myself out...
---
Inb4 a swarm of Kikimoras darkens the spacelanes in Delve, Pure Blind, &amp; the Drone Regions
---
You can't. So cope.
---
No.
---
The ship has sailed on supercapital proliferation.  The solution is to make them fun to use (and lose).  I would love to see Titans / Supers eventually live in a world where they cannot impact subcapitals in any meaningful way.  The only time you would bring a supercapital fleet, is to fight another supercapital fleet.
---
Shows all outgoing and incoming wars, no way to disable, and not in the patch notes.
---
Really CCPenis?
---
Good try buddy, but keep participating.
---
Today, CCP sets record for most downvotes in the history of downvotes.
---
That's CCP's title, not mine. This dev blog went live about an hour and 24 minutes ago.

i have been cryong for 2 years about eve using 1gb ram per client

---
&gt;BR shows goons getting absolutely *hammered* by a fleet 1/3rd their size and taking over 3x the casualties of their opponents.  It is hilarious that he thought that this was a battle that went well.
---
just delete wormholes already ccp, we know you want to
---
Micro Machines: EVE edition
---
Looks like it’s been stablished that Imperium will loose to even number Subcaps vs Subcaps fleets.
---
According to Zkill they are loosing even when they out number them 2:1 opponent.
---
Why not just Field Super Capital Fleet which you already have an advantage on. Field super and steam roll Tribute like goons been saying.
---
Stop using this trash tool
---
Literally SPHERE.EXE
---
CCP:  Metrics show the new agency is a success, NOBODY removed it from their neocom!  PAT OURSELVES ON THE BACK BOIS!
---
Seriously though, why does this bother you so much?
---
B-b-but the newnewnewnewnewnew launcher won't ever do that anymore!  Falcon said so!
---
Telling a solo guy to fight a super deployment and raving about muh internet spaceship warriors. Lmao, does each goon get a personal cock to shove down their throats or do you all skewer yourselves mouth to anus on the Mittani's?
---
i don't believe you
---
Will the Triglavian Ark supercapital ship be buildable like Sansha's super?
---
The NCDock meme is not new to this conflict, it has been around for a bit. The first time I heard it was when killahbee told the faction Titans to dock bit I'm sure it was around before then too.
---
This....this is genius, and probably just about simple enough.  It could be made ALMOST foolproof if it flashed, and yelled UNDOCK THE THINGS...HON HON HON! every 10 seconds.
---
CCP has gone full Pearl Abyss.  1 Microtransaction whale makes up for 100 dedicated players, so they don't care if real players quit.
---
Wow what resolution do you play on that the wardec icon makes the game unplayable? 1024x768?
---
Restarted my launcher, lost all my accounts and settings. Restarted it 1/2 dozen times it magically worked. Then not the next few times I started it. Magic comes and goes apparently.
---
64bit client comes with free bits!
---
So, sounds like Drifter incursions then?  You know, the ones they removed because literally nobody did them?
---
That was a fun op. Made about 700m in loot. Ty rorquals
---
The other dude is incorrect. 
---
In short, you can collapse a wormhole by traversing it repeatedly in heavy ships, such as a battleship. You can also calculate exactly how many 'passes' it takes you to do so. Let's say it takes you n passes to close it completely, n being an even number (so your ship is back where it started after the whole process). 
---
Using this information, you can stop before making the last pass, and leave the ship cloaked on the other side of the hole - this keeps the hole open, but very close to collapsing - all it takes to close it is decloaking the ship on the other side and jumping through - in other words, 'pulling the doorstop'. 
---
This is a very valuable technique for controlling the static connections of a wormhole. If you just collapse it, a new one opens up and anyone else in the hole can start scanning through it. However, if you keep the static doorstopped, then any hostile scanners jumping out can be easily rolled out, and any incoming fleets can be denied entry as long as they are spotted in time.
---
Yeah they hang around on gates.
---
I would assume not, as it is several times larger than current titans.
---
I thought you were going to link to [https://downloadmoreram.com/](https://downloadmoreram.com/), but that video is good too!
---
The ones with the 'anchoring' prefix scram, they are present in the foothold systems after the invasion has progressed a bit.
---
Every major patch breaks things, you'll just have to wait for things to calm down a bit in the coming days.
---
Why don't they just make a DUST clone for PC? People actually liked that game.
---
Hell yeah, the trigs should evict us all into wormholes hahaha
---
Wait, what? Not sure I completely understand this change, do you mean that every signature will no longer need to be scanned down?
---
Slow response is due to the cooldown on actions represented by the light grey wheel in the upper left hand corner when joining a fleet and vice versa also known as the session change timer.
---
Good info.
---
The system I was in was a bit hectic... new for everyone...
---
Lots of wrecks around
---
Check some statistics like average people in space, ships destroyed in the last hour and see how nicely is shown on the old map and how bad is on the new map.
---
The new map has all the same features, and it can be resized and viewed like any other window instead of being full screen.
---
Most people just want something to complain about /shrug
---
Let epib mememe post xddd
---
Not pissed...more like...bored.  But you might be right about that last part.
---
&gt;i like this beause im a retard who needs handholding
---
fucking hiseccers
---
By "new map" you mean the 3D one right?
---
This was never a problem when they had an in game browser.
---
well the voting buttons are pretty nice.
---
From an accessibility of information standpoint, asking people (e.g. newbies) to dig through Social &gt; Corporations &gt; Wars every single time they log in is stupid. Would you have thought to look there if no one told you it was?
---
I suppose you want me to congratulate you that you figured that out ALL by yourself on your lonesome, and no one else in the game ever mentored or told you about wardec mechanics? 
---
Yeah, I don't believe that.
---
To be fair, it doesn't. Not in the slightest. But I was asked for an example, there was an easy ine on ZKill.
---
Sorry, version type specifically refers to Release/Beta/Development - which of those are you running?  If it's not Release, then you may be vulnerable to instability.
---
Just jumping in to say that yea, the ratio of kills/deaths isn't really important. 
---
If you're learning something new about how to fight, like building your ship for a specific purpose (get in fast and close and brawl, or disrupt their tracking, or neut them out) and are doing better at executing on that purpose, you're in good shape. 
---
Good luck out there!
---
No? Lack of local and the ability to PvP without cap drops is what makes wormholes great, not lack of content or features available to others
---
So any reason yet, not to opt in and download the 64 bit client?
---
I'm honestly not sure why anyone seemed to expect more than just more reskinned Incursion trash.  CCP's specialty is to overhype and underdeliver, this isn't really new.
---
The thing that has always bothered me is how much time it takes to undock at times after clicking the button.
---
Nah dude you are wrong NC. should stay and give good fights to goons so their leadership can justify this pointless war.Must be sad to krab all year and only use supers/titans to grind defenseless citadels
---
In his defense, Resource Wars is one of the biggest failures CCP has ever designed, so its understandable that he forgot they exist.
---
Sorry, when I say version type I refer to Release/Beta/Development (you can see this in the E settings menu).  I recommend running on release, as it is more stable.
---
Slight OCD with having everything ordered the way I want, and nothing "extra" or out of place... everytime my settings got nuked I suffered until everything was back were it was "supposed" to be.
---
Just as an example, I have a really big library, hundreads of books, and I could tell if one if missing just by looking at it while passing by.
---
The icon itself has some issues regarding "safety" im the game, but besides that I wouldn't really care if I were able to opt out of it showing up.
---
The Vexor reminds me of a price tag gun.
---
&gt; From an accessibility of information standpoint, asking people to dig through Social &gt; Corporations &gt; Wars every single time they log in is stupid
---
It is, that's why literally nobody with a brain has ever checked wardecs that way.
---
&gt;Would you have thought to look there if no one told you it was?
---
The entire concept of EVE is a sandbox that doesn't hold your hand. There's a button fucking labelled War History so anyone capable of sentient thought can find wars for themselves, but if something so complex is beyond you there's always Google. God forbid you dare ask ANOTHER PLAYER how something works!
---
Would that be personal storage space or per keepstar in general?
---
ceo of corp that doesn't live in wormholes, tells wormholers they don't live in his definition of a wormhole either...! :P
---
Very carefully.
---
Lol the internet complains about the new finder cause it give too much info and then complains that it does not give info in space that is unknown.... /spacepalm
---
and moobs!
---
It's not broken it just only gets the first 100 kills provided from zkill. It's creator was planning to ask squizz to get more again but i don't know what happened to that. Until that's worked out, to cite the guy: 
---
&gt;stop blobbing

---
Oh, forgot Wingspan is a highsec corp.
---
And you reposted it here solely to whore karma. So the guy is not wrong.
---
The cutest possible thing i ever saw on this sub :3
---
people should stop quoting this statement. Greyscale never said that.
---
Classic CCP.  Changing a functioning part of the game that no one is worried about into a non functioning part of the game and still not addressing the issues that players care about.
---
So lemme get this straight. 
---
Players have been mad at CCP because CCP doesn't do much for newbies and makes the player base pick up the slack. E.g. bad default overview, etc. 
---
People have also literally raged at CCP for other things taking more mouse clicks than before.
---
CCP implements change to make wardecs more visible for newbies but doesn't make it possible to remove... which \_helps newbies\_ and \_saves mouse clicks\_ and 
---
people STILL rage because "I learned to do it the hard way and so should you" ?
---
Call me a white knight for CCP if you want to, but jesus christ this community is impossible to please. Be thankful they're making QoL changes at all. I don't like the Agency, I HATE it, but this wardec change is good at making the wardec system more visible to new players.
---
Maybe they should offer an option to remove it, I'm all for player choice, but christ, calm the fuck down. It's a single goddamn icon.
---
It's not bad tbh, it's above the solar system, next to other timers.

Definitely not as distracting as OP claims
---
You don't have to look and see who you are at war with though. That is what a proper overview setup is for.
---
That was not the purpose of my post. I can care less about the amount of karma I get. The purpose is merely to spread information, especially for those at work who can not view the official EVE Online website.
---
&gt;Yes. Previously, 32bit EVE clients could only use 4GB of RAM, regardless of option selection. Now they can use more. They may not use more, but now the underlying architecture is not the reason it can't/won't.
---
its stupid to use so little, way more disk i/o then.
---
\&gt;Join the biggest entity in the game who no one wants to fight
---
\&gt;Be bored
---
Imagine my shock
---
does stable mean it remembers accounts
---
Reported all over the official forums. I couldn't log in to check some things before work this morning. Either its fixed by the time I get home this afternoon or other games it is
---
You're fucking retarded. People complained about the overview because the default one is useless shit that shows fleet members and blues. People complain when CCP make things take more mouse clicks than before by removing features for 0 reason.
---
CCP start handholding retards because extra profit means more than keeping to the spirit of the game, and force that feature on everyone for no actual reason, and people complain. But hey maybe there's no point arguing with you, because if you live in hisec you're deficient in braincells.
---
That spot was already being used by other timers, like the invulnerability or gate cloak timers
---
&gt; Character Selection Screen takes about 10 seconds to launch after clicking the character  
---
These delays have been caused by server-side issues, rather than anything specifically wrong with the 64-bit client. As of around 30 minutes ago we've hot-fixed some of the worst causes of delays, and will be applying more fixes in the coming days.

Won't accept that whatever "point" was made has been addressed, check.

Bitching, check.

---
Listen to this guy. Duncan is the Bob Ross of nerds.
---
Lets be real, it would still be a significant effort to get a lone WH candidate past the null blocks, potentially splitting the votes wouldn't help.
---
I thought they got rid of it cause it was easily exploitable...
---
They won the objective. If they can continue to throw ships into the grinder it really doesn't matter how often they get beaten in the actual subcap battle.
---
&gt; for going for what looks like the most appropriate strategy given their situation. 
---
Lowering NC morale by dunking on them for not fighting is also the most appropriate strategy though.
---
They did increase the distance a lot which is basically "patching" it. Slow boating 300000 km takes way too long. I'm pretty sure it used to be 10000 which is like 30-60 minutes of burning. 300000 means that you will almost certainly hit downtime first.
---
Even the "Invasion expansion features" video does not explain invasions. I would like to understand how they work as I will not be able to play for a couple of weeks.
---
Anyone can point me to something, video, articles, explaining what invasions actually are? And are they cool? ok? Meh?
---
Yeah, I figured this pretty much.  The break itself wasn't planned in any way, so it sucks, but hey... shit happens.  Nice thing about it is there are ways to make ISK again if I wanted to get back into the game.  Thanks man.
---
Literally unplayable
---
lolol
---
If you haven't, take the exploration career agent series.  It's pretty basic but gives you a decent intro to the use of probes
---
The Expansion is called Invasion where the title of the video leads from, not from the mechanic itself.
---
But then he'd have to undock to see if there were going to be big bad wardecs on his hisec station!!
---
Its just been the same Fleets going around since DT, nothing much happening
---
lmfao
---
Its a compete waste of time, rewards are terrible, you basically just fly around chasing wrecks to be the first to salvage, because its just a free for all its shit, if you bring a dps ship or logi you get nothing because of all the scavengers in destroyers with just salvagers fitted
---
Turns out Upwell was being fed Trig tech during the whole development process, now all citadels will switch sides
---
We have docking rights in Goon citadels?
---
Honestly... id have it not really drop any reward. The reward would be stopping them murderfucking your space. Would potentially hit everyone and give some high end content PVE wise. Would maybe encourage more spreading out too. Just would be cool to add something like that, realistically hitting every group (can imagine Omist getting murderzoned by them based on ratting numbers...)
---
I think y'all need to invest in a teleprompter. Poor guy.
---
My question is : If you're in lowsec, why hamstring yourself by not using implants and boosters? It doesn't make it any less solo.
---

Damn that game can be utterly endless if you enjoy it. And I don't see how someone wouldn't enjoy it. It's like spicy Sims on steroids with infinite variations to creation, geography, stories, and characters.

Newbies don't have proper overview setups. Hell, even that isn't perfect (using Z-S when in a newbie corp will cause fellow NPCcorpers to disappear from the PVP tab because "they're blues"). This wasn't for us, it was for them.

they're easy to please
---
don't do retarded ui things you can't turn off or move in a game entirely about ui 
---
guess what they always fucking do
---
tl;dr: The bots and caldari farmers arrived while the gallente ones disappeared.
---
Basically in the warzone the LP farmers can make it impossible for the losing side to meaningfully plex a system without a concerted siege (which is obviously limited in scope and turns into a pvp feeding frenzy.) Meanwhile the side with farmers/bots usually has anywhere from 2 to 5+ systems that are about 90% and can be pushed in one evening.
---
That's kind of the first order explanation. Caldari is T5 right now so they are in full farming mode with tons of bots and farmers running minmatar offensive plexes because there's so few gallente ones left (basically only home systems of active corps/alliances).
---
Supporting that is a "rebirth" of DnG on the amarr side and a number of old timers rejoining. DnG is behind probably 70% of the amarr bashes so far. Practically everything "north" of the imaginary line below amamake (if you look at dotlan.)
---
The second order explanation is that amarr LPs were worth 3k ISK and minmatars had a huge glut of LPs that weren't worth much at all. So the LP incentive for minmatar to plex is pretty low. They'd rather hold their LP and let scarcity push value up for a while.
---
Finally, there's only 3 major groups left on the minmatar side. Smile 'n' Wave in Huola (Russians who are very risk averse and don't plex/farm much.) Ushra'Khan in Kamela (Euros who tend to only be active in medium+ gangs when Harkon is there to FC.) Finally Wild Geese in Huola (US tz? they mostly fly cheap T1 thrashers in groups of 5+.) Add in a few small corps (especially VABC who probably do half the minmatar plexing thanks to one autist and an army of alts) and you have all the minnies accounted for.
---
Farmers and bots are 100% behind the current reversal. DnG activity has skyrocketed compared to February but on the warzone control front, we mostly just bash the hubs and plex the last 5-10%. Most of the other active groups like Yondu are in the same boat at the moment.
---
Walking in stations coming in update? Casino's?
---
Question: Do they have activity only inside their systems? do they roam?
---
You are kind of missing the point though. Forgetting how this impacts Low/Null - they made this change to help Newbros. There is now even more direct competition from 'power players' resulting in even LESS content for Newbros than there was before the patch. I made a gif (cant post here yet cus account is too new) that shows in 30 results of Hi-sec there is ONLY 1 signature in EVERY system.
---

What's preventing you from popping the salvage cats?

As someone who is actually in the hobby of statue collecting: they should have done more research. Triforce has done a lot of companies collectors editions (which are garbage) and little else, and have stolen a lot of people's money. They've had problems releasing serious statues/prop replicas for years. As much as I hate them QMX was probably their best bet to go for at that time.
---
Cloaky camping is worse for places that aren't delve :&gt;
---
Fair enough. I suffer from a touch of that as well, so I can empathize. Perhaps in the future they will let people deactivate it the same way we already can for other things. I wish it were possible to move all that system data to the _right_ side of the screen (it's locked to the left)
---
Oh, i thought it would be a different thing
---
:/
---
Same. My poor little cow had been through many fights. Bye bye, Little Hierophant
---
if ccp cared about new players they should have put the wallet on the fucking neocom
---
Yet i have to report that all ships that warp from a Structure will stay in the tethered animation, status bar will say this aswell : 
---

Lol OP doesn't know left from right. Massive difference if it was actually on the right side of the screen where overviews and station panels usually are.

---
Cool. But...
---
Titans are so massive they have their own gravity fields and can affect tides on planets when too close.
---
They cannot enter an atmosphere.
---
Their weapons would cause far, far, far more destruction than what is depicted here.
---
agreed
---
Ah yes, the "my fanbois are laughing at you so you're wrong" argument.
---
Where did you have yours before? Curious
---
thanks :D

You literally just listed two things that wormholes "lack" while saying what makes them great is not the "lack" of content or features available to others.
---
If CCP cared about newbros, they should require the 5+ accounts needed to play effectively at the start.
---
You might want to post on r/evejobs.
---
&gt;I would love to see Titans / Supers eventually live in a world where they cannot impact subcapitals in any meaningful way.  The only time you would bring a supercapital fleet, is to fight another supercapital fleet.
---
Make them only be able to apply damage to large things, like supercaps and structures. With some damage application to capitals but shooting at battleships would have severe application penalties. 
---
Also nerf doomsdays or make them riskier to use (make them work more like siege, no remote reps or something).
---
Nonsense, anyone can do this stuff! It just takes some reading and curiosity. Give it a shot and use every hurdle as a learning experience!
---
true. in some cases its not a big deal and arguably the 4+Gb/s read/write we have on modern drives does mitigate delays caused from loading/caching/and buffering of disk based datas.  still, id rather a game use 20gb of ram if its available, just so its got more for the gpu vram to pull from with out needing to access the ssd
---
You think having local is a feature? :P
---
I guess if it's worth 60b in subcaps per fort destroyed than more power to them.
---
Yeah, maybe give Titans a point defense system as a bit of a buff, but kill the stupid boson.
---
That *is* broken, this fight alone had over 700 deaths.
---
That's mostly the nullbears, so most of eve actually.
---
It's one way of making isk, to many people (including me) it's more enjoyable than shooting red squares precisely because it has a feel of exploring the unknown about it.
---
&gt; Let's assume they did listen to us, a change would not be easy
---
Yes it would, just don't show signatures outside the current system.
---
This, or a Fleet in Being. Gotta play to your strengths.
---
I'm loving the shirt
---
The window resolution is not scaling for me. The client detects or chooses a lower window resolution, and when I maximize it doesn't upscale the resolution itself. The graphic settings still show the lower screen resolution despite the window being full screen. As a result the graphics look low quality. I'm using a laptop with external monitor, extending the screen size.
---
Didn't know about this. Thanks!
---
I stand by all my negative comments about enchantment and near-lootbox mechanics of mutaplasmids, and the negative effect on the general sandbox of providing completely safe (from PVP) instanced PVE. The content itself is kind of cool but the way it was delivered was, and is, bad for Eve.
---
DHSJ seems to always give good fights when I roam out there.
---
I was thinking per keepstar but obviously the numbers can be scaled. If 1 titan isn't enough, make it 100. Or whatever.
---
It still will. You won't know what a sig is until you scan it. At least now you won't have to waste a ton of time in systems that have nothing and you can get right to the juice.
---
Again, nothing new.
---
Now when a combat signature escalates, itll appear here.

---
Been flying a blaster MWD, omni-tanked fit for 2.5 weeks now.  Level 4 missions in a .6 sec system.  No real issues that weren't trackable to my mistakes.  Tank was good, could use a bit of reworking on rigs and tracking, but all in all solid.  Much more engaging then BShips.
---
Pull Assault vs Serps.  Cake, ran this 5 times in this ship.  Warp to site, everything on, take gate to 1st pocket.  Burn towards center right group as normal, dropping a MTU when everything is under 80 KM away.  Orbit a BS in said group at 2500m and start popping things.  Switch to orbiting other BS in group as the one I'm on pops.
---
Look around to see what group is closest after this BS.
---
Armor alarm.  "Dafaq?  What do you mean 50% armor?"
---
Check speed, at 20 m/s.  No webs.  MWD is off, but should be above 200 m/s.  Look at ship and my heart sinks.
---
It's doing the "collision with something" wiggle.  "fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK!"
---
Overheat the rep and try to fly away from anything I could be bumping into.  A lonely rock, visually 10 KM away, is the only thing it could be.  Manually fly away from it, watching as my ship flops like a fish out of water.
---
Hull alarm.
---
"Sigh..."
---
At 30% Hull, it starts accelerating.  Hits 50 m/s before I hit my pod.
---
Spend the rest of the night fit-warrioring the previous issues away and flying around to pickup bits to rebuild it.
---
...and that's how a frigate sized rock with a collision box the size of a Titan ruined my night.
---

---
It's a "feature"  CCP has altered the gui.  Pray they dony alter it any further.
---
So a double nerf effectively.   Time to sell the Gila, in missiles I will trust.
---
Yes, though a few of the systems are running on dedicated cpu like Jita and they shift things around so a node might have 50-100 rarely used system and and a handful of usually busy ones that way if one spikes to 400 players for a fleet fight, it's unlikely to affect too many other players.
---
Save yourself a headache. Buy a cheap teleprompter.
---
Means they'll get cleared faster. Meaning they'll respawn quicker. Will reduce the prices a bit but should increase the content.
---
Haven't logged in since the patch, but I can really see this messing up the ui for people like me who play on old laptops. Everything's really crowded already at 1366x728, we don't need more clutter. Then again a guy on alliance discord said his CPU lit on fire with the 64bit client, so my days in EVE are probably numbered...
---
My alt has been hanging out in Everyshore recently. Almost every system in that region has a wormhole. 
---
I remember when the main difficulty with high sec ice mining was to find an ice belt that was present (and it was uphill both ways). With the new system, it becomes trivial to find systems with ice.
---
Still not working.
---
Yeah it took me quite a long time to log in the first time after installing patch. Seems to be fixed now.
---
&gt; but don't understand basic mechanics
---
You mean that one notification that gets spammed along with hundreds of other notifications?
---
&gt;Words just start not making sense
---
It's called " Semantic satiation". You're not going mad :)
---
With the world's smallest paintbrush of course.
---
To make that work while not offering anything you need no tax or really low tax. Max 1-2%.
---
Your plan is not new, [Strategic Exploration and Development Corp](https://evewho.com/corp/Strategic+Exploration+and+Development+Corp) does exactly that.
---
You probably need omega status to upgrade the corp to handle the size where it's worthwhile.
---
Recruitment will be the hard part. Ain't nothing to it but talking to a bunch of people and then trying to offer them enough to entice them to not leave.
---
Writing a registration system that doesn't work is retarded, but not quite as retarded as CCP not being prepared to accept that something on their end might not have worked and allow someone who is clearly a genuine candidate on the ballot.
---
And yeah if one of the GSM candidates mysteriously didn't appear, you can be sure there would be a lot of noise about it and something would probably get done.
---
what parallel are you trying to infer?
---
Kinda both. Few did them but the ones that did figured out how to optimize the fuck out of it and made bank.
---
Dude that is amazing!
---
tfw even ccp ai don't want to shoot citadels
---
then don't cry about panfam not feeding their fleets into your supers pls. 
---
you were lucky that the opqual was released at the right time and nobody was trying to smash your head in delve, otherwise we would see a completely different political map in eve today
---
That has been a concern of mine as well actually, and probably the best argument to offer hiding for this thing (or at the very least, a compact view for this information). It's getting increasingly difficult to play EVE on 720p setups, and 1366 is one of the most common screen resolutions on mainstream non-gamer laptops.
---
I will play support SF, dual lane mid with Tinker.
---
Maybe saying what you are having trouble with might help.
---
You train faster with omega. And if you hit the training cap for alpha, when omega you can train additional Alpha skills above the 6m SP.
---
I saw Trilavian eggs in Fountain
---
I did for you
---
&gt; Then go read ask the metrics guy in a month how many people turned off your idiocy
---
The problem with that is that then CCP will use that to turn stuff back on, and if you are the 1%, you still have to suffer.
---
I'm sorry if info pages have too many big words on them for the sort of people who live in hisec. I'll start putting all my income towards reading lessons for them.

That’s a little hyperbolic, really

Some say if you thumb down enough you get free sp.
---
There's nothing stopping me from just getting extra alpha accounts if I wanted more alpha skills... Was wondering if there was anything I could get that would actually last me but the answer is indeed no.

---
Old client has always defaulted to interval 1 for me as well. The interval settings are basically vsync settings. They don't actually change the performance of EVE, you just perceive better performance with interval immediate because frames are being generated more often, so it looks smoother.
---
Interval immediate: vsync off, throw out frames as fast as your GPU can bake em'
---
Interval one: vsync on, sync to monitor's refresh rate (or 60fps? don't remember)
---
Interval two: vsync on, sync to half refresh rate (30fps?)
---
Interval four: vsync on, sync to quarter refresh rate (15fps?)
---
I haven't found a direct application for the setting but I suppose it could be useful to limit the output rate of weaker GPUs in situations that would otherwise stress them too much?
---
If anyone knows what this setting is really intended to do, your input is welcome!
---
On the plus side it looks like it might be broken, it's claiming there is '1 signature in system' for basically every system. It should still be deleted though.
---
poor atron, you got frenched

---
Product teams love metrics like this. “Give me a single number that tells me how well I am doing!” 
---
Thumbs up/down is essentially a simplified version of Net Promoter Score, a flawed metric which was really popular for a while.
---
Every change to the UI outside of the capacitor/slot display since around 2011.
---
👎🏻 no krabs undocked to fight me

Just be aware that interval immediate may or may not turn your gpu into a toaster.

For the last 2+ years, "EVE for Dummies" UI just keeps getting worse and worse. The UI is so busy now, it's overwhelming. 
---
How can you work there, see the changes coming and say "Yeah, that's better than before"?
---
No wonder new player retention after 30 days is near zero. &lt;--stated by CCP CEO on Talking in Stations 2-3 months ago.
---
That was temporary.
---
Ah okay I didn't realize it was temporary
---
Welcome to EVE! :-)
---
We should change from saying "Literally unplayable" to CCP. Means the same, but uses far fewer keystrokes.
---
Yeah, that really doesn't seem that bad. Guessing it's just a change that rubbed him the wrong way and he wants to make a mountain out of a mole hill

It is meant to stop screen tearing. Which is where the screen starts to draw the next frame before it has finished the perverse frame.
---
Also screens can have different frame rates, the most common is 60hz then 144hz. Meaning interval two would be 72fps for a 144hz screen
---

I thought this was just an issue with it running on Linux, I spent an hour testing stuff before giving up.

It was Mort who was left off the ballot, not exooki.

Hodd lol was also left off the ballot for technical reasons. He would have been my #1 vote, along with Exooki.
---
You try to strike a balance, and in most cases Eve becomes a hobby, then an occasional "sign in and spin your ship" game, then you just hang around the subreddit posting about how CCP is "Killing a game" you haven't actually played in years.
---
Test and goons Never win whitout cap
---
Yep, the one with the 3D layout with all the colors and stars as a background :)
---
Could you list some actual gripes instead of a blanket phrase of "every single change?" You may have never worked in QA but I can assure you; giving some direction for your annoyance will go further to actually helping the game.
---
Not until all c4 corps have been systematically exterminated
---
Chung?
---
Well, by saying that you're also implying that you're as stupid as him. Are you?
---
you got to where you were because the cult of feverous dragged you there kek
---
loads faster, easier to navigate, 3d mode is way better in setting up waypoints for exploration, isn't cluttered, customizing it is very simple, system map is far far better in 3d d-scanning and is so much more responsive.  I fucking love the old map.
---
You get this in FW as well lol
---
The UI is not why new player retention is down.  High sec is boring. Spaceship control's are anticlimactic and limiting.  
---
I think something generational is happening.  Younger people are far less likely to be an Omega customer for 12 years like myself.  
---
A good new player experience would start with a real new bro corp made by CCP with real players getting paid to teach new people how to actually play.  
---
If CCP had anyone on staff who remembered how to play thing's would be so much better.
---
I enjoyed in the video how CCP\_Wonderboy says you don't need to learn what to do from other players, you can find content on your own with The Agency now. LOL! Only took 15 years for CCP to figure out most players like to do their own thing most of the time. Alliance and corp content is ok, but sometimes you just want to do, what you want to do.
---
There I paid your upvote back. Thanks for contributing.
---
the 10 second thing is due to session change. Which is why you don't want a rogue fleet boss or wing commander with free move on. Session change tackle is a thing. you will be spamming jump and never realize you are being moved from squad to squad.
---
I think this is a good addition, but you should be able to select which timers/status indicators you see in that section, for people who don't care about some of them.
---
EVE isn't by nature a single player / solo game. It becomes much more unforgiving for that play style the more "empire" you try to play. If you want to have stations and things like that, you need to have friends to help populate and protect.  Also, to answer the time zone question - you can set the time the structure's armor and hull timer are vulnerable to time you can be online.
---
Nice vid.
---
But all I see is moving ops, structure bashing, and high sec ganks. Where is the pvp?
---
No no no no, they must collect the data first and THEN they figure out what they did wrong.
---
\#EndStockholm
---
No, Every signature in k-space will be discover able in any system but you need to be in that system to scan it down
---
Citadels have reinforcement timers that are days apart and able to be set to your timezone.
---
If someone attacks your citadel you just have to log in and defend it. You can also just say whatever and let them destroy it and all your stuff in it will be asset safetied to a different station.
---
Still didnt address the caps. You stated they lack x and y while not lacking content c or y of other players.
---
Bet you’re glad it didn’t exist during WWB.
---
Y’all seemed quite cozy all docked up then 😊 .. but, the shoe is definitely on the other foot now so, have fun with it!
---
You are concerned over 1m isk?
---
They are free now, let them go with the Hive.
---
Maybe the top DPS/Reps should be done in similar fashion like in WoW and other MMOs - by plugins that can consume the metrics on the clients. They are there for everyone anyway.
---
CCP would say join up with others in a corp or alliance, EVE structure ownership are "generally" not meant for solo gameplay.
---
\- Note: Their opinion does not reflect the reality that some people don't want to play it their way.
---
Stop telling newbeans how to suck every last isk from the time they play and start telling them how to have fun.
---
It is perfectly fine to concentrate on having fun when you are a newbean, even if that means delaying your secondary account a few weeks or months.

New map has a lot of good filter options for systems, but the colors sort of blend together too much to be of value in some places except for extreme outliers; if I am looking for system tax, unless it is 8-9%+ I cannot see it.
---
Old map is better for seeing density of players in systems and several other things, having sharper colors on a black background to help pick stuff out, and so on. New map is pretty, but the functionality is a little iffy...
---
Don't be lazy, read about Upwell Structures timers and how they work. That will answer 90% of your question.
---
For the rest, EVE will let you sink as much time as you want into it, but at the same time allow you to play casually if you choose to.
---
Cooperation is key, this is a social game like no other; if you want to improve your experience in any aspect, find people to play with that can have your back when you need to.
---
At the end of the day, if you can't protect your own stuff you'll have to deal with losing it. Just the way it is.
---
I think there should be a bigger push to get folks into dedicated new player corporations.
---
Something like the agency:  
---
What do you want to do?  
---
1) Relative Safety of High Security space - include a video with a description of all the things they could do.  
---
2) Faction warfare - same deal, and list dedicated newbie corps that do work in that area.  
---
3) Null Security - Large player empires, etc etc, and then have each of the major newbie corps write up a thing, and give them the ability to apply.  
---
4) Wormholes  
---
The current NPC corporation is terrible, and pushing folks into new player corporations would be great.
---
Karmafleet has restrictions, but why can't the in-game allow people to visit the webiste to apply?  PH is also a good corporation to get started in, and is even easier.  Same thing for brave, and EVE Uni...
---
The problem is players don't know about these corporations when they are brand new.  All of them offer great things for new players, and get them involved in the action.  I think Null Sec is where we should send new players by default, and let them decide if they want to go somewhere else.  Everything else, at least from a new player perspective, is boring, or they can't do it.
---
I don't even like snuff and what you say is absurd.
---
20 accounts, never had the launcher forget any accounts.
---
I HATE THE EMAIL VERIFICATION CRAP! So sick of doing it every time I want to re-sub or add an account to my launcher. Once on my IP, ok. Every time? Come on CCP!
---
I started playing EVE at 13. No one cares how old you are as long as you're willing to learn (and actually *do* learn).
---
They should have added rat loot for that
---
If they don’t have a Bahamut as well I’m going to be let down
---
Every time I think it would be interesting to get into video game design, the fan base of this game convinces me of the opposite.
---
The original post offers little in the way of constructive criticism and is essentially a non-starting blast of hot air. Cool reddit post!
---
What makes you think you're not one of them?
---
It tells you that there are signatures. You won't know what they are unless you scan them down. 
---
If you've gone through the constellation, you will know what signatures are wh, combat, relic or data sites. Then you can watch the Agency for changes. If you're an ice pirate, you can see when the belts respawn, so you don't have to roam around moaning for your ice for your 🍹 cosmo.

What's a wormhole? I've only been playing for 10 years, please forgive my noob question.

---
Evict us into Abyssal space, then they periodically invade through filaments, forcing us to constantly fight them. That's right. WE are the new EVP content.

You think having a lot of caps drop on you is a feature? Come on, guy. Wh &gt; null
---
🤐............. 🧐👎
---
PAINT FOR THE PAINT GOD! THIN FOR THE THIN COATS!
---
It's almost like they don't want to spoil it and were expecting you to get up off of your ass and do something rather than wait to be spoonfed
---
I guess.  If you can find a way to explain it, fine, but that's literally the first time anyone's ever said that in all the years I've brought it up, and me and my friends all thought it was an empty/cheap character kill off.
---
Again, it made the following mission tone much more somber, and in war (and just life), sometimes people die from random stuff, in non-glorious ways, and there is no vengeance or anything...
---
...but it still feels sucky.
---
🤷‍♂️ Wish I could have played more but work had me occupied too much.
---
Got it. Well, that sucks donkey balls anyway, this seems completely unfun and uncalled for.
---
Yeah, I read all the books through...Contact Harvest, I think?  And one or two later, the Thursday War, maybe?
---
But I mean the game here.  It may have just been "Halo: Reach", been a while since I've played it.  But it recounts the general event of the Fall of Reach itself (not of the specific book events, but I mean the overall Covenant attack and destruction of the Human colony/world.)
---
So you're basically saying disable vsync.
---
Thank you very much. There's still some manual editing required, the lists includes some false-positives like "CharlieBlueprint_PLACEHOLDER," but this got me the closest to what I was after by far.
---
Appreciate the help. :)
---
We call that vertical sync. Vsync for short. (see above)
---
I just couldn't remember if the interval settings synced to the monitor's refresh rate or to preset refresh rates.
---
Combine with a recon and you get a really shitty camping experience.
---
Ah, my mistake.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
so thats what they ment by "daily login bonus"
---
I did, but I really didn't do much. Ran some explo sites, dodged a gank, sold some stuff, wasn't feeling the solo this mornin.

because fuck you

This has never forgotten one of my accounts ever.. You dont need ISBOXER to use it. You can sync it /login/cookes across multiple machines with google drive. It encrypts your cookies unlike the ccp launcher. Its far superior.

This. That baffled me at my last reinstall. Why the fuck would they remove wallet?
---
Old player retention is down too haha
---
As I went out today to test the feature, I found it largely didn't work. Maybe if it stays not working we can have more fun.
---
Your definition of dedication seems to differ slightly from their definition.
---
2
---
Attacking an opponent in their weakest timezone is a legitimate strategy and a time honored tradition in Eve. You should definitely plan to counter it.
---
Part of the counter comes from citadel/sov mechanics, as others have already pointed out, and the rest comes from recruiting members/corps in your weak timezones until you have nearly 24/7 coverage. Allying with other corps or alliances who can plug the timezone gap is also common.
---
Also, if you're trying to have a real life you might be playing the wrong game. Just sayin'.
---
Sure, you can delay your secondary account, but you can't really delay your tertiary, quaternary and quinary accounts.
---
I’m pretty sure it’s spelled “draek”.

But .... but ... all this SPOD!!!!
---
Yep, I've got mine set to Interval Two because Interval One is 120fps and does nothing besides put unnecessary strain on my hardware, 60fps that Interval Two gives is plenty and doesn't cause my system to do its best to imitate a space heater.
---
Can you do a pencil drawing of all the isk I need for the skill books?
---
Where do they draw the line though. CCP has to draw it somewhere. Hodd was excluded too. Do you just let every late or messed up application in? 
---
Xenuria managed to not fuck it up, how hard can it be

This is an amazing picture, well done

Locks to a preset fraction of the screens default refresh rate. Ex. My system has a 120hz display so Interval 1 is 120fps, 2 is 60fps, 3 is 40fps, 4 is 30fps.
---
Appears fixed now. At least less intrusive.
---
i mean its up where the temp cloak timer n stuff pop up is it really in the way?  Though having an option would be nice
---
Stick your head in our public channel if you're still a bit adrift maybe: https://old.reddit.com/r/evejobs/comments/agoan1/75mil_sp_pilot_lookin_for_home/ee8i915/ that's roughly what we're about, though we don't use Nestors much anymore, and most of the sp reqs are pretty soft.

We need more isk sinks

A wormhole enters J-space or unknown space where there are relic and data sites and ratting sites they are a type of anomaly so you need a explorer fit to find them
---
What a coincidence! I'm working on a Tiamat as well. With the new Ikitursa I expected it to be the main focus of a lot of art.
---
WIP: https://i.imgur.com/FmdlML5.jpg
---
Edit: I don't mean to take away anything from your post, it looks dope as hell and I'm just surprised to see the Tiamat make a comeback.
---
Why was hodd excluded? Mistake on his part or did he encounter a similar situation to Mort?
---
What ?
---
Every patch.
---
Can't they say a new category is like an old category when they add it, so it gets defaulted to the same settings?
---
OH MUH GERDDD IT TAKES UP SO MUCH SCREEN REAL ESTATE!!
---
No, but there were plenty of other problems. I miss the IGB but it was outdated. I wish they had updated it instead of removing it.
---
Aren't the T2 Triglavian ships made by the empires? As far as I remember from the ship descriptions on sisi, dunno if those descriptions made it to TQ though.
---
you about gallente logo? all t2 triglavian ships are the result of the work of the imperial factions. you can read about it in info
---
ikitursa -  caldari  
---
zarmazd- amarr  
---
draugur - minmatar  
---
nergal - gallente
---
Everything still fine here with two clients on 8gb of ddr3, just because your ram gets filled doesn't mean your "out" of ram.
---
Maybe they really just like the Gallente pleasure hubs?  Give them a break.  They need a place to unwind after all this invading.
---
That's actually kind of funny... xD
---
That's nothing compared to the gifts we recieved from CCP in the form of the "Active Wars" notification and being able to see Cosmic Anoms through the Agency!
---
Two things absolutely noone asked for, but precious gifts nontheless! 
---
And you complain because they just seriously fucked up some textures on the new ships? You sir, are really ungratefull with the amazing development CCP is giving EVE Online.

so this is what transgender shipkins look like
---
amazing, I was not able to witness this in Benghazi, but after being resurrected with the help of a mass Atron sacrifice I can now experience the magic goon botting!
---
What this guy is trying to say is that he's one of the types that goes around looking to be offended by everything. The virtue signal types. He wants everything to be free of naughty thoughts. So, when a goon or a dino posts something spicy in local, his butt gets hurt and he can't help but become "that guy" who has to police speech in an otherwise chill fleet.
---
Still stuck in the drone bay that doesn't exist.  Open ship fitting and you see drones there that can't be there.  Triglavian physics.
---
Nice, I'd really like a 3d printer but I reckon it would end up taking way too much of my time up
---
Tiamat's an alliance tourny cruiser so I wouldn't really call it a come back, especially with the invasion stuff on tq right now
---
Go to windowed mode on the probe window, it will show up in any view except full for the solar system map
---
Thanks for that. I've got a 144Hz display, I just couldn't remember whether I had the display running at 60Hz or 144Hz last time I played with the interval settings. I'm just at work right now so I wasn't able to double check!
---
(I've been working on diagnosing some very squirrelly hardware issues recently and have re-installed various operating systems in the process, at which point the display drivers default to using 60Hz)

I can't tell if the article was a lame attempt to copy Hilmar's stupid idea list at the fan event or just a summary of all the bad ideas the reddit crowd has been coming up with lately.

In the cutscene, while Noble leader is on coms the coms get cut seconds after they notice the massive radiation flare that is right above them.
---
It's a weird way to kill a character, but it's nearly 100% accurate to how vulnerable spartans are without their shields.
---
so you want a csm who can parrot your talking points
---
yikes
---
Yeah I keep it at Interval Two cause at 120fps the game has no visible improvements but it increases my hardware temps by 15c.
---
Teleprompters also don't prevent it.
---
LOL Yep.  good point.
---
Give them a few weeks of bliss before they realize their life is over as they know it?

TL:DR  CSM Candidate did not succesfully submit an http form or recognize that something went wrong with http form submission. 
---
So many unneccessary words.
---
&gt; I truly love Low Sec and I am the only one going for CSM who predominately lives and fights in Low Sec \*\*\* 
---
No you are not  
---
I was going to look more into this but I'm not completely convinced this isn't a meme post. It seems odd you are asking for feedback after one of the lowest effort posts I think I've ever seen.
---
Oh right, now I understand.. I don’t think I processed his comment correctly when I first read it.
---
But that’s one of the things that puts me off as well, somebody says “That’s gay” then a guy goes off how we should respect everyone no matter sexual preference and gender. So it’s not just what people say that creates a toxic environment, it’s also those that react to it.
---
Personally I don’t need this type of drama in a game and surely don’t wanna hear people whining over comms, I’m here to have fun and have a good laugh.
---
Mostly because my CSM term was uncharacteristically successful and even today we are seeing the fruits of my labors. Pink ships, that was me. UI pointer, I pushed hard for that during CSM 11. Up/Down system in the client is part of a behavioral mapping tool that I spoke with Ghost about and provided him with a wealth of research on the subject. Some of the best things in this expansion are the result of CCP having an idea they ran by the CSM and me saying "Yes you need to do this and here is why...".
---
Awwww, how cute!
---
Wow... that worked, thanks!
---
Where does it show it’s a wormhole.
---
Literally every system in delve has some crabber in on their 10 rorq alts watching for sigs to pop.  Who then immediately post the sig to their intel tools.  Which sets off alarms to have scanned down.  
---
There’s literally no change from this to the way it was.  Except for the disorganized mega coalitions who employ legions of IT to develop and maintain their IT and now even the small guys can have nice things...
---
I don't really think these are "my" talking points, you twat.  They are either core mechanics in wormhole space that ANY CSM claiming to represent the space should know about, or are issues that need to be addressed and are routinely brought up in any discussion about WH problems in the current meta.  But go ahead and say they're "my" issues.  That's fine, as long as you don't mind your ignorance showing.
---
Oh come on. If a sig spawns it leads them right to the system to probe it down. Sure it may not be a wormhole but this is going to give them a massive advantage for finding them.
---
Fucking mint that is.
---
But now it sparkles!
---
It gets updated (by me) when a new SDE comes out. 
---
It's normally a day or two after a release, but depends how busy the team members involved are.
---
Well then I hope you contribute to whoever ends up on the CSM and any CCP focus groups.  We could use more/better representation going forward, that's for sure!
---
its funny though, anybody else would do what NC. does and panfam posters would be all over them, criticizing and trolling.
---
Just snark that "They could never be defeated because game mechanics have led to them having a lead that can never be overcome, competition is completely impossible now, everyone is unsubbing and eve is dying" was being said 13 years ago about a group that was defeated shortly after and no longer exists now.
---
I like being able to easily see if I'm at war.
---
Cosmic Agents is meh but who cares? just dont use it if you dont need it?
---
Triglavs are LITERALLY tearing apart and breaking the border between space and time... pretty damn sure the red background is perfectly warranted
---
Maybe if you run 100 more accounts you can even the playing field?
---
I used it to map wormhole space without tabbing in and out of game.  I was severely disappointed when they removed it.
---
Jelly ?
---
-1 was expecting a dad joke.  Disappointed
---
Splitting the fleet with a boosher can work as well if you can split the logi away from the DPS, or split one of the logi off from the others.
---
Sounds like nerd spurgers stomping other nerd spurgers and then posting to reddit abo--- oh right... 
---
Personally I find these sorts of 'playpens' to keep undesirable ~~whiny jumped up kids~~ players out of my preferred space.
---
What flavor?
---
Salt
---
No, was thinking grape or strawberry.
---
Wormholes attract a "special" breed... (that shouldn't breed)
---
Because their portals are red, duh.
---
Is there any profit in killing the invasion rats?
---
Again it’s not any different than how big alliances/coalitions build out of game intel for their members to use.  This makes it so all groups can fight closer to parity.  
---
Besides go ask VOLTA or Inner Hell if they have trouble gutting out crabber space on the daily.  Who gives a shit if crabbers can see the WH spawns IH/VOLTA are thru and have a rorq tackled before the first intel channel post is made.
---
And you don't see him complaining about incursion space...
---
Left side buttons and right side buttons are basically the same
---
&gt; Imagine thinking zkill actually matters.

&gt; Transfers structures to another corp to save killboards.

##PICK ONE
---
You underestimate the amount of ganks people make from backprobes that someone has mapped out hours before the op.   
---
CCP have now taken out a complete "way of hunting" this is exactly what this game does not need.
---
To be fair this is EvE, I doubt anyone here is afraid of math
---
Everyone goes into UI design thinking they are going to change the world with their obviously better (usually actually better) ideas. 
---
However. If you want to make 100K+ a year you're working for a corporation that does not care what you like or what is better. Your decisions are made for you ahead of time and you will adhere to the style guide or you will be fired and replaced with someone 5 years younger with way less to lose and only asking for half the money. 
---
This goes for most code/development...
---
fucking awesome work!
---
Beautiful
---
TWO THIN COATS!
---
it's not that I don't like UI changes. I don't like bad UI changes. sadly most of the big ones are terrible.
---
The big alliances are 23/7 operations that have AUTZ, EUTZ and USTZ cores who keep the engines ticking over in their respective diurnal cycles. When there's a major timer/fleet fight coming you'll generally see two of the three TZs join forces to swell fleet numbers. For instance TEST seems to have a strong EUTZ core and good numbers in USTZ, so on weekends you'll have a peak that corresponds to the EU early-evening hours and a very long tail as US guys begin sitting down for their evening play sessions.
---
"Darwin has 1 blue. We are not affiliated with any null blocks of any kind" and lm sure this is why you will not get on the csm but hay ho
---
Team lol. You mean one person obviously from what they put out.
---
Good. Now make Caldari recons useful pls?
---
Are the invasion rats dropping the mats/bpcs for the t2 trip ships, or is that just abyss?
---
People aren't complaining because it's on their screen. 
---
They're complaining because it's on hapless war targets screens.
---
Regardless of outcome, I'm gonna need those swimsuit pics
---
K.  Guess we’ll see.  I’m not a crabby bitter old vet and wouldn’t mind seeing how it plays out before casting judgement.  I really don’t think this changes one iota of difference.  WH gangs are still gonna be a thing because they rage roll holes for the good crabber holes.   Literally as soon as the hole spawns in 0.0 space 2 tackle frigs are 2 jumps deep and in the belts looking for juicy targets.
---
Haven't seen any reward yet that would entice someone to participate, even a new player.
---
Abyss weren’t dropping new trig mats/bpc’s 
---
I think they are only in the invasions. IMO a shame
---
Yes I'm aware. I do this daily in thera.
---
Then what’s the problem!  Get gud!!  Salt harvested!!
---
this is where you are wrong, I am not crying I find it hilarious and am loving the way the tables have been turned.  But they couldnt have been turned without the help of panfam themselves shitting all over their former allies.
---
Aren't goon subs on deployment like 200-300% reimbursement?
---
&gt;You underestimate the amount of ganks people make from backprobes that someone has mapped out hours before the op.CCP have now taken out a complete "way of hunting" this is exactly what this game does not need.
---
.... Wtf man. Are you all here?
---
The best thing that could happen to this game is if all of CCP were required to spend time playing the game as players play it.  In a null sec bloc, in a wormhole, in a low sec hot dropping corp.  
---
Highsec should be reduced to 4 racial regions with the rest turned into low sec like low is now, and all current low sec should lose the gate and station guns.   
---
Highsec should feel limited so that players are encouraged to get out.
---
People laughed when I said the activity tracker was added to find ways to monetize parts of the game. It's coming.
---
&gt;Maybe they really just like the Gallente pleasure hubs
---
just open nergal discrition.and all other t2 triglavian.its all made by empires  
---
Adapting the Collective's **Damavik-class** frigate design, the **Nergal**'s basic premise is to turn the Triglavian light hull into an assault frigate that builds on the powerful capabilities of the core ship frame. The Nergal has been modified using a variety of designs but draws principally from the popular **Enyo-class assault frigate**, using the Triglavian energy systems and the light entropic disintegrator capacity create a fearsome attack ship.
---
Morrre salt from the Thera gangs fuel me!!
---
And my 12 rorquals yesssssss
---
Dear CCP UI team,
---
As a new player, the new Agency helps me find what I've been trying to figure out for the last two months of gameplay but haven't had the right questions to ask my Corp.  Don't let this muppet OP talk you down about doing a good job.  Some of us appreciate it.
---
Clown.
---
yeah idk this huge bait and switch is fucking horrible
---
made me excited, and then they quietly pretend what they promised never happened
---
not surprised in the slightest, it's the most CCP thing to do
---
Salt? Im worried about other groups mate. A whole way of hunting ruined.   
---
I'll catch supers / rorquals no problem dont you worry :P
---
Nah actually wormholes are. Nothing prevents snuffed from dropping 5 caps on a small gang in lowsec
---
I'd much prefer CCP tell me what improvements I should expect
---
&gt; So how does Eve work with players/corps who are trying to grow in-game while having lives outside the game?
---
It starts with reading up on a game mechanic that has been around for over a decade.     
---
To save you the 30 seconds of google search, the defenders get to choose when the star base is vulnerable and can be destroyed. Additionally, the game is weighed heavily towards the defenders.
---
Buying escelations from those who ground them out is good. Especially if you buy escelations of stuff players can't do yet. Be it 5/10 from high sec players or 8/10 from new null sec players. You win on the drops, the player that sold them won because it would go to waste otherwise. Run them and done.
---
Half the fun is earning the corpse though
---
[MFW I click thumbs up](https://i.redd.it/axhp4rlc0d901.jpg)

---

Your drones might have gone rogue
---
&gt; This goes for most code/development...
---
... mmm no.
---
Lmao you’re really buying into the “we will iterate” thing aren’t you
---
What other groups?  My original comment stands.  Git gotter gudder.
---
Go Input broadcast a bot farm to get Elo Knight elected to the CSM.   
---
Oh.. wait.. whoops
---
You are an absolute retard. Jesus..
---
Be glad that new experimention stuff that nobody will mess with in a month is not added to your area. A whole expansion that is going to last as much as resource wars.
---
Whole system turns red in the invasion, looks hella cool in warp
---
Lol coming from you I hardly take that as an insult
---
I will do that! Got to compete with the judge somehow.
---
Miss you too bud. Possibly one day I'll make my return and Win Eve again.
---
I will let you know the gallente are a proud race of space frenchmen.
---
What I find it funny is that every time CCP fails a project, they fire useful community people; we don't even have enough community support to allow us to run proper tournaments where the players do all the work.  Yet somehow the failed abortion of a UI team is still getting enough resources to make retard-level changes every patch.  Guess I shouldn't expect better with a community of enablers, most sane people have already left.
---
People have told them in detail why certain UI changes are a terrible idea, and all they shoot back is arrogant bullshit about why we're wrong.  There's no point in trying to be constructive at this point.
---
So, CCP has created troll items to appear on hoboleaks in the past, and never officially announced that suspect flags were coming back, except that their removal was temporary. AFIK CONCORD responding is a bug and wither is being worked on or has been fixed.
---
Yeah, given that I can look up sites in Delve from Jita or vice versa, why can't I look up sites in either from J space?
---
this needs to go to the top
---
The new materials are found from salvaging the new incursion rats.
---
Probably because CCP has done nothing in the last 5 years but make retarded changes to try to get new players, while not understanding anything about the game, so both new and old players get disgusted and leave.  The most amazing thing this company has done in years is convince someone they were worth a buyout.
---
I am against it - but dont be so sure that if reddit does not like it - then we speak for 90% of the community.
---
I guarantee the reason CCP have allowed is that they will analyse click/engagement metrics - and if proves that plenty of pilots use it then it will stay...
---
Shame the unknown of exploration is no longer there...
---
We try harder.
---
To be fair, 1366x768 is the same height and is extremely commonplace on a lot of low end laptops :(

---
You came to the wrong neighborhood if you want fun  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmS9vcVNr5A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmS9vcVNr5A)
---
so you just randomly warp around the system shooting rats that may or may not be in the place you just warped to, then you gotta loot/salvage things?
---
sounds like these are going to be a lot of hassle for fuck all reward.
---
Hey look, someone who doesn't realize that wormholes are not generally worried about by krabbers in Delve. Oh, and they think they plug them in to an intel tool. Nope.
---
As far as the scanning down, sure, but they are generally scanned down by folks using them for content, very rare to see folks trying to roll it that aren't the whbears from within.
---

With the launcher closed after I log in (like I always do) I still have evelauncher.exe running as a process. At one point I had 3 processes for it going as I logged in one toon, closed the launcher but then needed to log in another later on. 🤔
---
Can kill to process with no breaking of the client.
---
I mean if that’s the case, honestly I would understand why anyone would be complaining and I respect that.
---
But I think that’s the minority, other than that people find a reason to complain,  no matter what it is. Oh there’s an extra star in the galaxy, how dare you ruin my immersion CCP.
---
Hoboleaks are just that, leaks. Just because something technically exists in-game files as a string doesnt mean it will ever actually be in game. Your fault for believing and placing hype into that for no reason.
---
Yeah, and this poster points out [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/btz9zm/new\_patchnew\_annoyances/ep5z95c/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/btz9zm/new_patchnew_annoyances/ep5z95c/)  that the wardec icon is in the same place as Criminal/Suspect timers already have been, so this is much ado about nothing, really.
---
Even if this is half true what makes you or anyone think ccp giving the sig spawns in an agency window will cause any difference in how these are treated.  Those WHs are still gonna pop open and stay open for as long as they always are which depending on who occupies the space:  is either not long at all or idgaf in duration.  
---
The Thera tears are tasty indeed!
---
maybe you as an individual aren't cyring, but a lot of other goons are. 
---
panfam "shitting" on their former allies ( which were clearly stated as temporary by all sides btw ) is basically the only thing that keeps nullsec at least somewhat alive since you and test blue anything. what would be the biggest war in todays eve without panfam resetting standings, 100 hard knocks citizens vs 60.000 tapirium members?
---
I left condi a few months ago and during this time I had more fun in NC. than in the 3 years before in condi.
---
Damn, you have talent.
---
I mean, at least give ninja salvaging a suspect timer
---
&gt;no constructive criticism
---
&gt;add a button so we can turn off your bullshit
---
WH space is supposed to be empty. You have Sleeper sites and gas.
---
I wouldn't expect a ton of story driven content to be added to wh space, especially seeing as it already shits out money as it is.
---
Also you're cut off from the outside world. So of course you won't have access to these things while in wh space
---
Edit: added last line
---
u/SrGrafo
---
Uh one of these was an  official announcement.
---
Right. Well, I'm not here to get into an argument to inflate or deflate your ego, whichever way it might have gone, but what I am here to talk about is the fact that regardless of how many 'random' CSM candidates there are, they all have the right to run - and that being taken away simply because of a technical issue is ridiculous.
---
Yes. Because then you counter drop...  I'm in a small independent alliance, and we aren't afraid to use and lose caps for the GF even if outnumbered.
---
Lmao did you even open the Imgur link — it’s not from hoboleaks
---
So it is located in the exact same spot as suspect / criminal / jump cloak timers -- and occupies no more space than they did? Not bad at all.
---
Laziness. It pisses me off. They make this huge change to things and attempt to explain it = 0. LAZY
---
Stop whining, this change is good
---
&gt;hoboleaks
---
&gt;article written and published by ccp on the eveonline domain
---
Regardless of all of this, I'm just funneling all the support that I'd gathered into the top 2 candidates that the WH community decides on. That's been the plan since day 1.
---
very good
---
Sadly I'm only able to attend T1 frigate roams now, but I'll soon be able to join ops.
---
Plus there's so much stuff to do, solo PVP isn't that high on my priority list.
---
(reply part 2) BTW Sadic -- Another poster on a different thread pointed out that the new icon is located in the same spot [https://i.imgur.com/8mAy36I.png](https://i.imgur.com/8mAy36I.png)  as where the Criminal/Suspect/Jumpcloak timers already live. Considering that in battle you almost always have one of those timers (and you can't turn those off, either), nothing has changed insofar as how much space you have on the left side of the screen.

I agree with you 100% - but the UI of eve does not seem to have a strategic comprehensive goal in mind. It shows the wear and tear of being a continuous program in operation for 16 years. Consider other software you use - even Word/Excel get a revamp every 3 years to keep up with things.

there are some people misinterpreting it, but the suspect flag part he's talking about was *not* an official ccp posted article it was on hoboleaks, the concord thing was official. Which he said was a bug, implying that it wasn't intended..

redirect your anger and correcting behavior towards the people actually being spergs, helps to read before bitching that people aren't reading etc etc

Goons did that in WWB , also Imperium posters are all over reddit  criticizing and trolling panfam right now.

Perhaps you should save your money and put it towards some lessons in basic software and UI development. Then you'll realise that it's a good change.
---
Is it just me or is this title perfect for front page of reddit?
---
Then also please tell them take the yellow cans as well
---
They probably had one, but had to sell it after Nova's failure, since they ran out of devs to cut.
---
They had to roll the expansion out in stages to make sure it doesn't break the game. Each week it's going to change. Stay tuned.
---
A LOT, for now anyways. A couple corpmates and I got 2  bil in under an hour, the skill books are going for over a bil
---
Eve for me is almost a text based game. I only see about 30% of the "game" screen around my ship, and its for zooming out to check ranges, and approach angles. The rest is all boxed UI of text / data I'm scanning
---
Could you link to the “arrogant bullshit”
---
Can be you please elaborate on this? (aka source?)
---
[upd] because it sounds too promising to believe it.
---
Thanks. fixed.
---
Once upon a time people who couldn't be fucked to put a little effort into learning the game just quit instead of having CCP spoon-feed them everything. I think we were better off that way.
---
Other people have said that in the Abyss Trigs are just aggroing drones a lot more. 
---
Which makes sense with their hate of Rogue Drones.
---
How dare you sir. /s
---
not even local chat is visible at that point. Nothing will hold them back in station. Relog? UNDOCK is still enlarged.
---
Nice! Thanks for the detailed explanation!
---
I’m out of the loop.
---
What’s wrong with the new UI?
---
Good stuff.
---
We once dived into a WH, found a random in a T3 destroyer, he could hardly fly it and was lost, the WH had closed on him. We escorted him through Provi and released him into High Sec.
---
Thanks for pointing that out... it still annoys me, but is not as disruptive as I thought it would be from the screenshots (just got home).
---
Looks like it's already the right color to me.
---
all of them
---
let me turn off neocom folder shit 
---
let me turn off sounds individually 
---
let me turn off the stupid sensor sweep that prevents clicking on citadels/anoms/sigs in space for 10 seconds after I enter a system 
---
let me turn off the new wardec indicator 
---
let me turn off incursion everything
---
let me turn off the pop-ups when you warp to an anom grid
---
let's start there, is that enough for you
---
They had names, you heartless bastard!

New adventures! New adversaries! No loot tables! No rewards! Next level gameplay is finally here!

Great summary. Glad your liking the switch! C4 space == best space!!

&gt;I wouldn't expect a ton of story driven content to be added to wh space, especially seeing as it already shits out money as it is.
---
Only the higher end wh's
---
brings back memories to the days of the in game browser :(
---
It's not the old UI.
---
Because of course those are very relevant indeed to the topic being discussed. Back to your autistic hisec barge mining, friendo
---
You’ve literally communicated no new information
---
Sorta. If you're on Legendary, but not Easy or Normal.
---
And, like I said, you make a valid point, it's just not obvious from the scene itself (it's been ages since I played it, but do they show all their shields flickering off?), and it's not that realistic (the Jackal takes the one shot, instead of two or three of them lining up and killing several of the Spartans; the Jackal actually runs away [the only time I can EVER remember a Jackal sniper doing that in any Halo game...]), even if they are Spartan IIIs.
---
It's realistic in the "real world" sense of war, but not in the "Halo Spartan super soldier" sense of cinematic, hero with plot armor war.
---
Compare it to any of the other deaths in the series, even of "normals" like Captain and Commander Keys or Sargent Johnson and you'll see what I mean.
---
Named characters tend not to die from random causes/war shots.  They're either killed by named/important enemies (CDR Keys, SGT Johnson) or major plot events (CAPT Keys), or major heroic sacrifices (the Spartan II on the Noble team, can't think of his name atm - even though his sacrifice was almost immediately negated by the arrival of the Covenant fleet...)
---
Good article. I'm not sure I'd invite a day 1 player into wormhole space, it's good to have some basics first, but certainly a day 30 player would be absolutely fine in low class space, with a c1-3 static to explore in.
---
OP is overblowing this one a bit but it would be nice to have the option to turn it off.
---
I've been hearing about this for quite some time now, and honestly I have no idea what this change truly means to EVE... :(
---
Hehe yeah the DED LP store Is amusing too, 2 skillbooks, a datacore and like 10 skins.
---
Are you from spooky space?
---
...dude what.  It's a matter of preference.  If someone knows who their alliance is at war with like, a diplo perhaps, this is just unnecessary clutter.  I don't think it's a big deal at all but it would be nice to have the option to turn it off.
---
Basing the loot on salvage without changing the highsec mechanics around ninja salvaging is surely a bad idea.
---
These systems should have Concord turned off (with a suitably big loud warning, of course) as the original plan appears to have been.
---
why dont you ask TEST or Deadco about how temporary it was, and if they were willing to be put on farm status until Goons came north then bail out panfam then go back to farm status.
---
As far as game experience it is all subjective to the individual person.  You have found a place you like which is good, I am in the place I like and have a lot of fun.
---
The big part is salvage, and there are lot of ninja salvagers running around currently...
---
Will sell own corpse for subs
---
And be paid considerably less no doubt. (and then their are the benefits and perks of course) 
---
A stacked retirement plan with 20 years of 6% contributions and steady 5%+growth on a considerable portfolio of investments. I'm done@58 assuming no one kicks me in the dick 2008 style again. 
---
Unless the federal government suddenly pushes for full federal legalization of cannabis and my high-risk picks come out on top. (In which case i'll just disappear on a boat made of paper-machet money.) None of this changes the reality that when you reach this level you are more steward than anything else. We have an RnD team full of in-by-11 dreamers. They produce very little compared to the whole. It just gets boiled down into exactly the sort of shit OP is complaining about. Every time. (but this year with a reactive interface, ooh look how it blurs the text beneath!)

I know right? How on Earth could a thread moaning about UI elements and game software design be in any way related to UI and software development...
---
But it literally doesn't anymore...
---
Radial menu only starts appearing about 4 minutes into the game session. After that, no issues so far.
---
So did they forget to add rewards? Inb4 brand new content dead like always
---
Im thinking about re-subbing. But last time i got bored of mindlessly shooting rocks or blobbing ships. Though i really enjoy reading and talking about the political/strategic meta game.
---
What other kinds of fun is there? Or how do I get more engaged with the metagame that seems fun to me?
---
its awesome seeing his comics/memes spread to other subs im in.
---
Pay should go up, actually. If you are with some staff aug company just executing pre-planned work you should move into the planning side of it - or find a company that wants you to solve the problems and values your opinions. Staff aug is typically low paying, but get involved with driving solutions and your pay, responsibility and self-value should all go up.
---
I dont see a Noctis in that fleet comp.
---
How was there no loot? :( wtf...
---
That's... thoughtful
---
Correct.
---
No problem. I apologize for snarking at you initially with the "your tears are delicious" comment I made (and deleted) :&lt;
---
A month or two ago I died due to being an idiot and not seeing my then-corp's Wardec Active notice while transporting a Nestor to J-Space. I dreamed up this same feature back then, but to put it inline with the Security Status, just to the right of "Jita 0.9," so it would read "Jita 0.9 **/!\\** *&lt; Kimotoro &lt; The Forge" .* Being there might explain *wordlessly* to a newbie what a wardec is -- a sec-status exception.
---
\[edit: also in my vision for it, it would only appear when you're in HS or LS, not Null/JS too\]
---
but meh, this works too, I guess. I agree it's slightly distracting, though my eyes have adjusted to its presence.
---
**On the bright side:** Nobody needs to ever put "WARDEC ACTIVE" in their Corp MOTDs ever again.
---
Argh no. Please stop giving this advice to newbies. The test server is a great place to try out stuff that you can't try out in TQ, but a much better answer is to *just try it*. If you are in highsec, basically nothing will point you. If you find that your tank isn't holding, warp out. If you're concerned about getting one-shot, then slap a plate or a shield extender on for the first run and check how big the incoming hits are.
---

Nah, you earned mine for free. Keep up the great work.

You have more, by any chance?
---
yes
---
I posted one before. Also I don't have to be a video maker to critique them. I can do that as an audience member.
---
Or did your feelings get hurt that someone in your space guild made a shit video and some nerd on the internet critiqued it?
---
Or even for fucking undocking at this point 😂
---
P 2 W
---
Maybe they’ll add it later
---
During their recent Eve Pulse [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i3mliwfi3s), they mentioned that the invasion was going to evolve over the coming weeks. I'm willing to bet that the invasion won't be a high sec only thing, but they haven't yet announced what's coming.
---
It also sounds like bullshit from a delivery standpoint
---
Lol downvoted me?
---
As a matter of fact, whether you like it or not, it can and will happen. Fact of EVE. It happened last night to us, but we had already won our objective and were outnumbered big time so we didn't counter drop. What's the point of having OP pirate/trig BS &amp; Fax comp if there's no counter to it? You can build fax in a WH and make it incredibly hard for subs alone to kill.
---
... damn, I thought it was going to be Collins Key.. I am disappoint.
---
If you're flying a boosting ship such as a command dessie solo, can you use your command bursts on yourself? Or do you need to have fleet members on grid?
---
Yeah you have to know how to develop UI to be able to say a handholding mechanic that you can't opt out of or move to another point on the screen is a shitty idea. Fuck off you drooling retard.
---
This would unironically be cool as fuck. Groups marauding out of wormholes to scavenge for resources and non stop wormhole brawls conceptually arouse me more than it reasonably should.
---
Hi! 
---
How exactly is this option bugged? I can select it without problems and it does successfully hide the popup for further undocks. Please send a bug report with details, so we can fix it, if there is indeed a bug hidden somewhere. Thanks!
---
The eniter point is low effort.  We are Low Sec shitlers.. Its where we live its where we crab it is who we are.  We poke what we have called southern khanid.. aka a-2 in querious over and over for many years for content but we are low sec shitlers.  He decided to throw into the mix because we truely do not have any independant CSM members and have not in many years.  Every single one of them turns out to be a pet of some rando alliance or donut.  Not like he is going to make it because there is no 10k man alliance voting him in but cant blame the dude for trying.. Also your in NCdot so you dont matter.. \*Insert Nancydock Joke
---
This is honestly a pretty good summation of the opinions people have been putting forward, plus "can I get rid of the war notification"
---
no, they pussied out and made concord in effect in those systems after all so it doesnt really mean anything
---
Let's go ratting in highsec, said no one ever
---
More like P 2 P S, Pay to Play Sooner, it's easy to be an '09 char and be sanctimonious about earning SPs.
---
But it's exactly that.  If there's any change everyone will be in in arms about it
---
I have been offered positions plenty of times for various startups and even some well-entrenched studios. I'm not "all about the money" -- we only get one run at this life thing and I don't spend my time hating work... 
---
But I have yet to be offered a position that gives me that sort of "ultimate freedom" we're discussing and not be at the expense of absurd life risk (in the case of startups). Or just a low end / dead end product someone is trying to revive at a multi-nat... Meanwhile you can hear the flatline in the back.
---
On the other hand. As just-below-C level management I can tell you with all the confidence this side of capitalism that my original statement is scarily true. The message from the top row is pump and dump. There is an endless supply of college kids with debt up to the eyeballs willing to do a 130k a year job for 80k and do it with all fear and fervency of well.... A college kid making 80 grand at their first 'real job' who just had their first round of deferred bills come through...

First, remember that in most (all?) corps recruiters are unpaid volunteers. We slip up sometimes, and sometimes our own real lives interfere. As long as you aren't a dick about it, it's a good idea to check on the status of your application. My recommended way to do this is to explicitly ask one of the recruiters when *they* would like you to poke *them* if you haven't heard back sooner. This gets you a baseline of how long they expect the process to take, and gives you a super obvious excuse to check in if they are delayed. ("Hey there! So-and-so suggested I should poke you if I hadn't heard back by now. Is there anything you need from me?") If you didn't establish a checkin time at the start, it's also reasonable to use that as an excuse to do a checkin. ("Hey there! I'm pretty new to all this, so I'm not sure how long the process is supposed to take. Is a couple weeks like this normal? And if so, when should I poke someone if I don't hear back? Just want to make sure I'm not lost in the shuffle. Thanks!")
---
They probably just figured that half way through his term he'd get bored and abandon the CSM, so better to get it over with immediately.
---
The disincentivizing of pvp will continue until krabbing morale improves
---
the amount of code needed to turn concord on and off in certain systems will be too much for CCP. Remember that the concord code is pretty much the oldest in the game. Doesn't get more legacy code than that.
---
(No but I happen to think it would get more content into Khanid and help Stain)
---
Is billy looking for a corp?

---
I just want more screen space. Let me make local smaller, let me move system names and route and condense it (so much space taken up for so little info) I wanna see more space, not a little square of it in the middle of the screen.
---
that would be the dream
---
Seems like we never reached phase 2? There is some "rifts" on hoboleaks, i think they spawn in phase 2. But its all just geussing at this point.
---
I know, just trolling, but totally in the patch notes:  :)
---
&gt;Added an icon to the crimewatch timers section at the top left of the screen that clearly displays when your characters are involved in an active war.
---
This. Also the session timers when switching ship and/or pod are really annoying
---
Not commenting on a link. If you want to discuss, post the article.
---
Why do people insist on rep nestors.
---
We dove the same wormhole three times over the course of 8 hours looking for targets. They knew the wormhole was there yet did nothing to prevent it being used against them.
---
Also, rolling into nullsec isn't going to change as long as you are ready to jump in when you find something good. It will, however, mean that your targets know exactly where you came from.
---
Pretty shit change, imo. But its not going to stop us from getting killmails in this lifetime.
---
Well, not sure where you are in the world, but in my experience in the software industry in the Seattle area, I don't really think the experiences and observations you shared are accurate. The engineers on my team are the experts and all of the feature requests are going to the engineering team to solve - straight up. They are paid well for their expertise and I honestly feel like they value the input and direction they get to take the solutions. (Disclosure, I'm a PO that works with a SM / Engineering team to deliver feature updates to software in an agile environment)
---
That was a full-throated guffaw, thank you so much :-).
---
Nah, it just makes you more aware of the risk
---
Stupidly accurate
---
They scale with difficulty, as they should. Entry level wormholes are still profitable for newer players and day trippers, and as you get to C4/5/6 you start seeing exponentially more income.
---
Why does that make what I said any less true?
---
I don't know about "just" shooting rats. There are a hell of a lot of pods flying around lol
---
salty coins and milk
---
My friends warned me not to try and make salt related jokes around wormholers, they got a whole lot more salt than I can handle.
---
What Nestor fit did you run?
---
Role Bonus: 50% bonus to Remote Armor Repairer amount
---
Fozzie was on Suitonia's stream earlier and indicated that the support article was poorly worded and they would be removing it - he clarified that the intent was to let people know that CONCORD would not be responding to Triglavian ships attacking players.
---
So the official line is that it was simply a poor choice of words on CCP's part.
---
Figures! I have been repeatedly told to leave the NY/DC based corps and get off the East Coast entirely. Unfortunately not everything is so easy in practice when you have another half.
---
&gt; Fuck off you drooling retard.
---
Okay... without hitting the downvote button before you try it... look in the mirror and repeat 3 times "I am not a 12 year old boy playing CoD"
---
That was worth a full-throated guffaw, thank you so much :-).
---
Yeah it's not very well explained that the pulse took out half the electronic decives nearby.
---
As for the accuracy, I meant in the lore. Spartan without a shield is full of weak points even for conventional weapons, not to mention energy DMRs.
---
that's funny, that's exactly the sort of shit I'm asking to turn *off*
---
This guy. This guy is a fuckin' *wizard*
---
Yeah no titan drops, the power blocs will be spread out as they won’t have enough resources per WH.. All the quality and most important resources would be on the surface of new eden.. People would be able to hold a system but it would have to be very strategically guarded and set up.
---
If only hahahah
---
Looked in my hangar recently, and I have a stack of 20 injectors.

What's the Thread Count setting do and should it be on default?

Great write up bud, welcome to wh's
---
I might in a bit, right now I'm just easing in to the game again and training up new chars. I'm ditching my old chars and while I could extract a ton of sp from them I don't really want to do that too much. So the new char (with this name actually) is training and will go do some solo pvp first, aiming for command dessies (never used those) and the likes. My PVE char is already done (Ishtar doing combat exploration).
---
I don't want to over do it but thanks for the invite :)

what bothers me more than anything else is that, up until "Into the Abyss" they actually continued to make the login themes, but they only uploaded them to soundcloud.

It seems like such a waste. Hell - they could just include the current login theme music in the launcher, and make it able to be turned off by a setting which can make it stay turned off or on without affecting the game client audio settings!  
---
@CCP - your sound department deserve more of the spotlight, rather than being hidden away on soundcloud!
---
EDIT: added the links
---
Yeah, did a double take on the title before I noticed which sub it was from.
---
I had this problem, fixed it by clearing the cache and ending any instances of Eve stuff running, doesn't show up anymore.
---
because a cheap nestor reps literally twice as much as a guard, with 3 times the buffer, and no cap chain micro and would effectively take a tali bhaal of neut pressure to make it stop repping?
---
turns out being poor means I can't waste money on bad things
---
The best part is that now the signatures don't even show in system and the agency window is completely useless.
---
I logged a k-space alt just to make sure and yep it's another fuck you to wormholers from CCP.
---
I’m glad I made you smile :)
---
It's almost like both ends of the industry are working against each other because bean-counters decided that demographic research isn't valuable in the era of googlemetrics /s

You think it be like it is but it don't.

WTB Jintaan corpses #Team20

From this all I get is generally poor or bitter attitude, age bias, odd sense of entitlement because you work (not sure why you added that in tbh). Your experiences may be true of your own, but you are generalising too far.
---
I’m a 2010 char and bought no less than 150. Noobs only wish it was P2W. Realization comes later on that increased options too soon only means it takes you longer to master any. Great dopamine hit though.

 "can I get rid of the war notification"  dont do wars.
---
I'd suggest painting it with a Bellicose.
---
Exactly, you wanted more meta pvp added, CCP all over it.
---
Another frustrating thing, it gives you a count down and yet it’s still longer than the few seconds cooldown that you get for switching ships or pods.
---
the only constant is change

I'm sorry I hurt your feelings :)

Yes there is coordination with people in different time zones. This is one of the benefits of a larger alliance, you can have people covering each time zone. Then you just set all your defensive timers for the attacker's weakest time zone.
---
and ftr people definitely have taken time off work/called in sick because of wars xD
---
Complaining is one of the key aspects to being a WHer.
---
Hey, those are actionable items. Nicely done!

Terseness aside, people are just as passionate to make this game as you are to play it, help them help you and hopefully some of these items will get handled.
---
No,  they're worthless.  I'll trade you some carbon for them.

It's literally another small indicator among a group of indicators. People are making some deal out of it like "Der herr herr, I dunt need no extree help ta tell me how ta play, I is a leet PeeeveeePeer. Deez are unly for da dummbbb folks, how doo ya tern dis off, its dumb, we dunt need it?"

Triglavian ship book? I guess I can unload the stacks of skill books I've been holding onto now. Thought the demand would go up when they released 1m SP, but apparently not.

Hmm I have personaly no problems with new client whatsoever. It runs really well actually and i am looking forward to do some more stress tests with it.
---
 Never stopped me.
---
I think I'm gonna renew subscription to get some more WH action in my Cheetah. Back when I was playing, I was doing data and relic sites in null and I'd occasionally jump into a WH for a site or two, but never follow a chain because I was too scared of either getting killed or getting stuck. That was hands down the most intensive and exciting experience in my relatively short Eve career.

Not enough players left for a lightbulb joke anymore.

I feel like I am the only wormholer who is okay with this? Fuck that kspace bullshit and keep it out of wormholes.
---
nah man Am0k is good for me
---
If you right click the salvage and select show info there should be an industry tab that shows what it's used for.
---
It's permanently enabled if you're part of any null bloc, though.  If we can disable button blink, why not this?  You still haven't provided me a reason this should not be disable-able.  I don't care if it's enabled by default, just let me turn it off if I want.
---
DANGER ZONE!
---
The top comment is the best, I'll try to post the image from my phone...
---
The only good thing to come out of this video was his trophy for shittiest music selection in the history of eve online videos.
---
&gt; but, the shoe is definitely on the other foot now so, have fun with it!
---
Meaning, Goons raping and pillaging, burning down the North?  
---
Something tells me there is a lot of fun to be had on that revenge spree. Seems clear, you need goons blessing if you want to hold sov in EVE or that tornado is going to blow down your trailers every so often. Those in the north pissed off the entire game and karma is coming to collect for the rest of EVE.
---
thanks for sharing your opinion
---
This irony detector is off the charts!
---
You're on a roll of brainlet comments today aren't you...
---
Yes, that's the visible docking radius. It's been there for a while, you're just noticing it b/c it changed color. Usually, it's more white.
---
Yet *another* problem that state-enforced homosexuality would solve!
---
I feel like I've already read this article before, word for word, somewhere else....
---
That's fine... But the person he responded to said 
---
"sometimes ccp puts fake shit in so hoboleaks releases fake shit" 
---
which is true, and a lot of developers do it with how prominent it is for people to dig through shit.
---
And mentioned that they thought the concord thing was a bug.
---
Thus pointing out the OP of this thread is complaining about dumb shit, basically unless ccp actually comes out and says that wasn't the truth then it's a bug.
---
They were just pointing that out, and then someone replied basically to someone elses comment, saying that him mentioning hoboleaks was wrong because it was an official ccp release.
---
Which it was not, not what the guy was saying.
---
So, not sure what your point is.
---
Wait.. what? lol
---
Haha holy fuck 20 years later and I now understand that [simpsons reference](https://youtu.be/SxI7B758XBQ?t=51).
---
I miss @CCP_Punkturis thats all.
---
Revenge ... perhaps, however,  considering the swelling of the goon numbers/members, I doubt a meaningful percentage of them were around for WWB ... they just hear stories.
---
So in the end it was different than welp squad.
---
The salvage is the big ticket items. The actual conduits haven't been released yet which is what pays concord lp.
---
you zoomers who white knight for CCP over and over again are the aids that CCP loves.... you are a waste
---
That's getting me incursion release nostalgia
---

No worries. I came back after 7-8 years out myself last year, and I took a good few months to figure the game out again and decide what I wanted to try and do. I couldn’t ditch Cap after finally (!) being able to fly everything subcap, but I have alts for other stuff I didn’t try before :)
---
You mean they managed to make shit rewards for another new PvE activity in HS ? It's almost as if there is a trend here ...
---
That's a really strange way of announcing things (saying something on a players stream), but I guess it is still better than complete silence.
---
And also I don't believe this. Sounds like damage control since it doesn't fit into following sentences either – "middle ground between high and low security space"? Plus, think about it, whole ninja-salvaging thing is prevented by ability to blap those who try and, wow, you can't do that if CONCORD watches you.
---
[upd] "...to repel the invaders or __other attackers__."
---
Now we never have to ask about bringing a drake. Its pocket size
---
I lost a crow and learned some lessons in a "fight" with Xtra once. I'll give you about tree fiddy for it.
---
So, you can't freely gank n00bs in HiSec and are mad?

Do they make pencils that big?

If you'd like to point out where i defended CCP i would love to see it.

It’s front page bait and OP is hoping this sub gives him the karma to get there.

Liquid talent
---
I see none of this is them as local FW Dirt n Glitter they either blob or dock
---
When running PvE fleets, they will vastly outperform cruiser logi with a few downsides that are less relevant, namely poor speed and low lock times which don’t matter in this situation. They also add a healthy amount of DPS through drones while having a bunch of mid slots for utility (remote tracking comps, paints, heavy tackle mods) which can alternatively be used for a ton of capacitor mods.
---
This is why we need a WH CSM.
---
I got drunk the other night and woke with a character skilled into frieghters. It was only like $40 worth of injectors but now I don't have a real reason for that character to do frieght...
---
You should make note thousands of people backstabbed or otherwise left goons during/around WWB, It was super fat before that fiasco. Much of that lot reshuffled back into goons as there is a culture they found desirable.
---
SpaceMonkies Alliance and Circle-of-Two are examples of huge swaths that left that coalition.
---
In general player #'s don't appear from thin air in #dying games, it's mostly reshuffling/rearrangement
---
You'll also see pandemic numbers swell, as they aimed to copy the successful goon model "Karmafleet" by a PL member making Pandemic Horde. Both sides just swell and become fattened as alphas became a thing and subcaps have value. pandemic horde is 17,000 members worth of swelling and didn't exist until recent years
---
Wormholes are less stupid versions of this triglavian crap, where you actually have no safety at all. You know, how the rest of EvE minus triglavian BS is.
---
No I won’t relax, it’s a useless feature that should never be placed in the game
---
We can't have choices in the hands of lowly players. Come on.
---
100%
---
It comes from salvaging rats that are part of the invasion.
---
You can absolutely run links on yourself as a way to buff your own ship. They’re not exclusively for fleets, and make nano battlecruisers or dessies running links a lot better.
---
UI is lacking in a lot of games. Apparently a lot of companies put a lot of money into other aspects of a game, except the one that everyone interacts with regardless of what they are doing in game.
---
10 hours and eight upvotes. This game is dead. 💀
---
Bursts effect the ship using them as well as any other ship in both range and fleet.
---
The interesting strategy and meta game you read about is typically reserved for higher level politics that is hard to crack into, but I find that personal stories between smaller groups of individuals can be just as fun. It’s not something you do by shooting rocks though, you have to interact and be social, preferably through shooting them
---
Actually NCPL's old super doctrine (wrecking ball) was used to fight outnumbered. Though that was prerorquals and skill injectors where it was much slower to catch-up to their supercap numbers.
---
Presumably yes. It appears invasion rats, when salvaged, provide the necessary industrial components for the new blueprints
---
This expansion had me excited and then became incredibly disappointing immediately.
---
You could look at FW or WHs for smaller scale fights, where blobing the opponent usually isn't an option. The best way to get involved in the metagame is to become an FC or fill some other leadership position within an alliance. You could always look into scamming and theft as a play style as well. Finally abyssal arenas can also be fun, though the cost of entry is rather high.
---
Just like every other item in the game!
---
* I just woke up, and haven't had my coffee. I'm a snarky bitch.
---
Eve is p2w lol you can literally buy % increases to stats.
---
Its a great form of p2w ino, but it is still p2w.
---
If this was just a year ago, then the station you used ought to be a citadel. Since it was in a wormhole though, if the citadel was unanchored or destroyed then it would have all been dropped, with no way for you to get it back. Of course, there’s the small chance that the citadel is still up, or that a Corp leader has saved your stuff or is otherwise willing to reimburse you for it. If you remember the Corp name or Jsig, I might be able to tell you if you would have a chance to reclaim it.
---
Or make associated accounts (i.e. ever added to the same launcher) only ever count as one vote so rorq farming spodbrains only get 1 vote.
---
\&gt;add something bad that no one wants in the game
---
\&gt;only reason it's not as bad is because ccp fucked up a bad feature
---
\&gt;
---
I mean, its hilarious that they're calling it an "expansion" when its a minor content patch at best
---
Especially when starting out.
---
This is a relief, but I now feel uncomfortable about the prospect of the UI lying to me.
---
They're learning
---
It looks like the right color if you use low graphics settings.

Probably wanted to ship a 0.1 m³ cargo.

I think my favorite is still "[Should jail time sentences be based on race?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/4ug611/should_jail_time_sentences_be_based_on_race/)"
---
The NPCs are going to be worth LPs in the later stages of the invasions.
---
CCP is a business. One sub, One vote. Being that this won't change the OP wants to make the process easier so long as he's paying for the pleasure.
---
Yes, but a 5% bump to missile damage will only be the difference in winning a fight if you actually know what you're doing.
---
You mean you have not had it lie to you already?
---
amd ryzen 7 user there... eve  runs smooth but big fights stull shuffling
---
Send me one Injector and Ill double it!
---
That's actually a really cute story. People helping randoms in wh space is rare.
---
Didn't happen to me but my friend in his Loki got rolled out of our hole without any probes. There was no eve scout cache in the system. There was however one guy in the structure that lived there. Loki pilot asked for help to get out. The guy was a pve corp newbie and was far more scared of the Loki.. but my friend reassured him he just wanted a way out. The guy agreed to help but he then revealed he was pretty lonely and was enjoying having someone to talk too. He proceeded to keep my Loki pilot friend hostage for company for over an hour just to talk to him in local before finally letting him out into High Sec.
---
already too much intel
---
You sure? Darkness does not have recent kills in systems relating to the war. Also dont see anything on the first few pages that indicates they are involved at all.
---
Yikes. All that and he never learned how to delegate?
---
Lol, since when have CCP reps ever told the truth?  They get caught in boldface lies constantly and usually silently edit out evidence, almost like they don't even understand how the internet works.
---
Is Pirates Little Helper still around?
---
Nah this guy is lying to you, I'll double his carbon
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Imagine double the waste in development for life because you left players the option to use the old ui/map/whatever and it had to be a concern for every update moving forward.
---
Better yet, 1 real person should be able to cast 1 vote.
---
Its almost like no local is a giant fallacy and wh chodes have no clue what they want.
---
Now I want an eve based mini-warfare game. 
---
Make it happen capsuleers
---
:munch:
---
If you put them all into 1 map you could just use 1 map.
---
It's a bug that will be patched tomorrow.  :)
---
FAKE NEWS!
---
Also a second thought.  
---
Why not just add an ingame browser so we can use DOTLAN in game.   
---
Thank you.
---
i thought it was already a painted drake with the cold iron skin? :P
---
shame there's 0 ways to enforce that.
---
I watched your video and cringed at the 60 odd accounts but admired the dedication and success. Your comments though are winning me over. I think I’ll give you a vote old bean.
---
Actually you cannot keep tabs on in via external program. That'd require ESI changes to implement that funcionality.
---
There is no ESI change for that funcionality.
---
If you want to be safe you have to manually check it
---
Kinda like the Drifter incursions evolved.
---
You must be new.
---
If I'll ever get elected the 300 something accounts we have between Mar5hy and me will be a huge factor.
---
I'm prepared to give up my personal interest for the health of the game. So should every other CSM candidate. Particularly empire builders.
---
PS: The great majority of our accounts are afk campers for content. They are not miners, producers or accounts allocated to SP farming. We recognize afk camping is not that great a mechanic. But it's a necessary evil to make Eve a little more dangerous.
---
yes, it is, but the blob complaining about the lack of goodfights when its 35000 to 3000 in sheer numbers is a bit stupid. when you're forming 600-700 titans and we get 300 subcaps. hmmmmm :thonking: do we undock and feed or deny you content, fighting when its advantageous? I may not be leadership but I know which way the wind blows.
---
enjoy your hubris
---
Half the range of guardians if you have some MWD Vindis burning around or hacs they are still useful.
---
First they came for our jukebox...and we spoke out.
---
Next they came for our browser...and we spoke out.
---
Then they came for our map...and we spoke out.
---
When they came for our chat system....
---
there was nobody left on the CCP community team to hear me speak out.
---
In the end the best they ever gave us was boot.ini.
---
Do you think the sensor sweep could have an effect on the overall load time of jumping into a new star system?
---
This is Day 1 and the market for this stuff just opened up. That "30 mil" today could be 300mil or more in a week.
---
but which one is the "any" key?
---
Nope. Crimewatch got rewritten in 2012.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/introducing-the-new-and-improved-crimewatch
---
The concept of it should never have made it out of the dumpster to begin with.
---
When a corp wardecs you, you have 24 hours before that war activates. Then they have to attack your citadel within the vulnerability time you setup. They have to attack a second time 36 hours later, and a third time like a week later. It's not "1) declare war 2) destroy citadel 3) profit". It's a whole process and you have all the time of the world to prepare a defense. You don't have defense? then contract one. It's a sandbox, use your imagination.
---
I feel like I addressed this...
---
It allows better management of memory, which was the main cause of disconnecting in tidi-fests. This means tidi battles will be much less of a pain.
---
Here's an article explaining it:  [https://www.techsupportalert.com/content/32-bit-and-64-bit-explained.htm](https://www.techsupportalert.com/content/32-bit-and-64-bit-explained.htm)
---
Yes this!
---
Is MBA like NBA? Would be great, I like basketball.
---
His Lordship Sir Quant could give you 260ms ticks.
---
Shit. Except for the first one that's been Eve for me for 12 years.
---
The infrastructure to merge accounts on users is already there, being used in the support ticket system. All CCP needs to do is create a higher layer of "users" and prerequisite real identities for them. In a game with literally endorsed multi-boxing, why not put a little bit effort and let everyone log into the website and the launcher as "users" who own many accounts. You don't want to enter a name? You can't vote. You enter fake name? GL with account retrieval should you ever get hacked.
---
Your vids are hilarious, keep it up. Looking forward to getting a few of those corpses.
---
Reeee good sir.  Reeeee
---
Eve players already think they’re lawyers, so why not I guess?
---
This may not be the end state of it. Give it a week it could just be a bug
---
Thats just rude
---
Because for a static fleet, particularly in PVE, they're great. They're a similar price range to a good guardian fit, rep more, have a better cap chain, and a bigger buffer. Plus you can use them to refit off and store extra ammo etc.
---
I vote to make them a permanent resident of Uedama
---
Brilliantly written article
---
Its just another form of "incursions".  Different targets, different loot maybe, and it will get dominated by whatever loot feeds the block alliances.  Not saying they will do them much at all... 
---
It is another CCP dice roll, lets see how they roll.
---
Some ppl do not have the time to stay on reddit or eve forums to keep up to date, so get off your 'i'm better than you, scrub' high horse and say what is the damn problem !
---
Ha, this guy internets
---
Seems to be either delayed or buggy as shit, yes. Nothing was accurate when I tested it this morning.
---
I don't think anyone is saying it's a huge factor for worse change. It is a fundamental step in the wrong direction though, a change made with narrow-minded reasoning. How many small bad decisions will EVE have before it stops being a good game?
---
7 years is a loooong time haha
---
Good points, now come up with good places to add more on/off buttons without massively increasing the clutter of options that your EVE client already has.
---
Dangerous for miners, but won't take a fight against folks trying to pvp against you.
---
I don't think any of the uniques are in the ship tree, are they?
---
What if that's why I'm poor?
---
Get rid of it?
---
[like this you mean?](https://i.imgur.com/eJce1AZ.png)
---
I do know how to do it but it has to be done every time you log in. so not really viable I guess ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Hydra and Tiamat are Alliance trophy ships. There will never be more than 50 of them in the game, b/c that's how many BPCs they awarded to the winners.
---
They aren't part of the official line. And if they do end up making a full Trig line, they'll either have to re-release those, or make something shockingly similar.
---
Oh look, you can link an article that was posted earlier.
---
Thanks! o7
---
no because it loads the locations anyway. it just doesn't let you click on them until it spins
---
so you see the little colored lines telling you where stuff is, but it doesn't make the icon in space until it spins. it's the definition of a feature that should be optional.
---
like dynamic camera movement. you can turn that off. it's the exact same thing: losing functionality for a cool animation, not a huge deal, but just let us turn it the fuck off so I can check the citadel to see if I get to play an mmo today
---
You got a good point there. Let's hope CCP sees it the same way and get their shit together. I like eve
---
I buy corpses in bulk 500k isk per from any citadel in Eve.  If you are ever wanting a bit if extra isk.
---
You should try and get a kill on your KB sometime this year...
---
He failed something on the preliminary background check that all candidates must pass. Your candidates had skeletons in the closet.
---
&gt;KB stats lmfao
---
I’m glad you can look up a bomber alt
---
Imagine loosing one of those lol
---
Mort obviously has something on his account that makes him ineligible.
---
[https://puu.sh/DyBqW/2624aa6a07.jpg](https://puu.sh/DyBqW/2624aa6a07.jpg)
---
Looks so sloppy
---
How do you know it was an error? Only candidates that CCP deem eligible are able to run.
---
Agreed
---
&gt; Dangerous for miners
---
This is pretty sufficient and exactly what Eve ecosystem needs atm.
---
We are whalers in Delve. We're open for good fights in which we won't get titanblobbed. We don't find them in Delve though. You should try roaming around with a casual fleet here.
---
Meanwhile, each time we do drop dreads we do so fully expecting people "pvping against us" coming and blapping them, and they often do.
---
Never not take the bait.
---
I alredy hate it when I have to open the Agency to go to an Esca. Wont get much better from advertising it to me for 5 minutes.
---
I have more FPS and everything seems quicker and smoother.
---
Dual-Boxing had less lag when alt-tabbing to the other toon.
---
After verifying the cache I had no more mouse lag.
---
So far, I'm lovin it!
---
what’d you hunt them in
---
Hi, I have done a bug report  ( ID EBR-176611)
---
I left click and it brings up 'alliance &gt; wars' window showing who I'm at war with. I right click and nothing happens.
---
I would just like the option to disable it as it is, for a large amount of the players, useless information due to living in Null sec and wars not mattering at all. It's in effect 'Caution, contents may be hot' on your morning coffee. You know it's hot, that is why you got it. You log into eve, you know people are at war with you. Same kind of thing. Having it on by default for newer players would be fine but having the option to disable would be great
---
Goon adjacent. Not actually a goon.
---
Go git'm

Eh...., I didn’t die so I had fun. Content was had.

Appreciate it. Maybe more to come. We’ll see if the next bash is as fun.
---
Void bombs were relevant throughout.
---
Least I know what pedantry means ;)
---
Oh look, I don't hang out on Reddit all day.
---
Not initially. The other reinforcement fleets were on other objectives and didn’t warp in till about 20 minutes had passed. You can tell because some of the initial deaths came back to the fight after. It was fun.
---
They are AT ships for 2018
---
A very small brush. 
---
Also, make it a keychain
---
As he said, it's not the docking radius. Those lights are still clearly there in the image he posted.
---
what new ui change?
---
logged in today didnt notice anything new
---
Good job killing 25 munnins.
---
Never giving you the aux cable btw.
---
Ship blueprints from the named battleships.
---
Thanks. Fixed
---
Hmmm, we were focused mostly on logi and command ships during the mid fight. We were obviously losing a ton of battleships at this point so I think FC was going after squishier easier to hit targets. KB reflects that. Who knows.
---
If things worked the way you thought they would, it wouldn't be a "middle ground", but literally just lowsec.It's blatantly obvious CCP was referring to the fact that there are NPCs camping gates and station undocks, with roaming fleets --- removing a safe aspect of highsec.
---
I'm glad fair or unfair things happened to you that made you not run for another term.
---
where there is drake, there must be Kawhi
---
For those complaining on no loot.
---
Each wave you kill brings another wave into system from what I can see, each wave has a chance to spawn Zorya.  
---
Zorya drops loot, good loot.  2 Kills today, 600 Mil skillbook and a 250 mil Unstable mutaplasmid. Took less than 10 minutes. Stop complaining and just learn your shit people. The salvage is also worth a bomb right now.
---
Is it possible to get a biomassed character back?
---
the settings menu or right click menu 
---
like every single other toggleable item in the game
---
The invasion works in tiers that progressively get worse. Sounds pretty reasonable to me.  
---
I'm glad CCP isn't rolling out sweeping changes and breaking their game, like they've done repeatedly in the past.
---
Sigh... Front page of Reddit here we come!
---
There's plenty of older code though.
---
If you think the throw-away testbed that was drifter incursions is comparable to a big update like this you need to lay off the spod. Drifter incursions were literally a test for the invasion.
---
wtf is this voodoo
---
Oh, that makes sense looking at your post; you’ve obviously never even heard of the word concise. Hint: less is more
---
Way to make that hidden ccplease
---
I cosine with this post! Take my upvote.
---
I invite you to check out r/crusaderkings and r/shitcrusaderkingssay.
---
Pog time to kill em
---
Adding options for whiny people who don't want new things bloats the game unnecessarily. This game updates slowly enough as it is. Every time they have to add a "Opt into bittervet mode" option, it's more work the devs have to deal with every update, and more room for bugs to surface.  
---
The new UI is fine, what they replaced was pretty terrible.
---
Its literally only there if you press the escape button. Its not like its popping a window in front of your face asking you for your response....
---
Or, here's an idea, they could keep it so we can continue to downvote CCP on a daily basis.
---
