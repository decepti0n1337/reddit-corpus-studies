what else am I going to do with them

---

---
&gt; Linux users can run pyfa using their distribution's Python interpreter. There is no official self-contained package for Linux, however, there are a number of third-party packages available through distribution-specific repositories.
---
To add to this, a more functional API system that would allow third party app developers easier access to data would absolutely fix a lot of things as well. Half the fun of eve was finding a quality app for just about anything.
---
This was especially true with trading. Having *actual* market data available in apps that you could sift through and you'd feel like a financial guru was like the best thing ever.
---
Pyfa works fine on linux. It's written in Python using a cross platform UI framework, it's just not distributed as a single executable.
---
Nope
---
&gt; it’s still too late.
---
It was borderline too late when they started tiericide in 2014. 
---
I really think it the whole WiS debacle that turned eve towards its current path today. That was the time when the higher-ups decided to start focusing on scraping money out of people while ignoring or only doing minor patches for major in-game issues. 
---
The people who said the monocle was a warning of how eve would die under the banner of pay-to-win were right all along.
---
Thank you so much for delivering on this.
---
Good luck to you wherever you end up next.

Give me back 3 character search you monsters!

Technetium was like this before the moon redistribution.  All the tech moons were in guristas space, so the northern alliances grew rich on moon income.  Other regions were comparatively poor, and those alliances made money off renting.  Its ultimately cumulated in a CFC (at the time, if memory serves) cartel called OTEC.
---
In short, regionalized resources were a thing, and caused a significant regional wealth disparity.  And regional resources weren’t  effective at driving content either.
---
Edit: spelling
---
So you wasted countless hours, for the reward of another evening of having your time wasted in 1% tidi while clients are crashing.
---
I always thought this was intentional, just no one bothered to do it because its supremely annoying
---
She's a keeper !
---
I’m not talking about in game harassment.
---
Care to link fit?
---
600 dps out of the box is real nice with hyena support.

EDIT: Very glad you are running for CSM &lt;3

21,000 m^3 is not the same as 21 km^3.
---
Edit: 21,000,000,000 m^3.
---
To be honest, the neocom graphics update we're a serious improvement even in monochrome. If they bad a little bit of accent color added in it would be better but the ones they released are pretty great.
---
You can't have a coalition with only 1 alliance. Just go back to calling it Darkness+RR.
---
In your time on CSM, were you able to gauge how much CCP's side projects impacted or hindered Eve development?  I always felt WoD and DUST somehow hampered Eve's development budget.
---
Also, did you ever get to meet CCP Veritas?  He did a lot of amazing back-end fixes, and I am unsure if his replacement has really filled his shoes.
---
Ah some good info, thanks. Yeah, I worried it would be too limited, like the T2 BPO situation. Alas.
---
The side projects started after I left the CSM, so no.
---
you think they'd learn from their mistakes?
---
Thanks for the kind words! And nope, I can't think of anything that wasn't covered. I'm a little surprised there were no blog questions but that's fine. There wasn't anything about the blog I particularly wanted to cover other than the E1 post.
---
I would say it is a community building event that keeps people playing and actually gets players that have 'won' to return due to hype.
---
They also removed the ship and item hanger icons and now everything is done through the inventory window. (Which I hate)
---
Likewise, I feel you were always a reasonable guy to talk with and fun to fly with. If there's ever a chance for TC 2.0, I'm there.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;I’m going to build me a Rokh. Then I’m going to come ~~kick your~~ mine in that  ass!
---
FTFY
---
In your time in CSM, did you ever get the impression that CCP ever considered a solution to cloak camping?  Or, did you find that they never considered noteworthy?
---
We should allow caps to be built in high security minus supers and titans.  (I know crazy idea).  Increase the number of builders and once they undock they have jump to low/null.  No lock ons at all even with war decs.  Elimanates any cap fights near build stations....  again i know i am crazy to suggest it but it would work.
---
What is truly needed is a hauler between DST and freighter.  And CCP is too blind to realize it. And do not say "Orca" as it sucks and is slow to warp.  A true 8 slot ship that takes way more than it normally worth to kill minus stupid people flying full faction with a cargo of the same.
---
On topic we already had limited resources in 2004 to 2008 time frame and it created alliances around moons and regions.  So right not much would change by limiting them.  Other than forcing import of items (modules) to low or null or evev high sec in some cases if too limited.   
---
Look at Eve history your repeating much of it.
---
It's on my radar but so many projects like this one never got out of alpha. Example: I was a big fan of Black Prophecy, but it crashed and burned and it was farther along than this.
---
I meant more what players/alliances do you think had the most effect on the game, whether intentional or not. But, I do appreciate your insight. I agree whole-heartedly on skill injectors. I think those and citadels have done irreparable damage to Eve.
---
Only the dankest of leeks for you sir.
---
Only hardcore players or people able to login daily get them? Fuck the casuals, right? Daily login rewards for any game are bullshit. It's sad to see so many Eve players cucked into the new CCP micro-transaction, daily login bullshit mentality.
---
It came up once during my time on CSM 8 and there was some discussion about making cloaks require some fuel. But overall, no, it's not considered a serious subject by CCP. They *want* that cloaky guy to decloak right next to the solo ratting Nyx and infinipoint him. That way, there's a chance of a fight.
---
What they don't want is that Nyx to be ratting forever in safety. So there's not much motivation to do anything about AFK cloaking and good motivation not to.
---
I went out of town for a friends birthday and came back to learn about the event. Not sure how my failure to revolve my life around a video game should exclude me from rewards. Quite a large reward at that. Something like 2+ weeks of free training because I decided not to dedicate my entire life around Eve. Kind of sad that so many players have been cucked into this mentality.
---
1. - nix
---
2. CCP Spitfire pinned a bunch of my suggestions in the forums and many of them were implemented in the following 2-3 years.
---
I feel that everyone should get these rewards, not just players able to log in during x days. If you are subbed, you get the reward. Should be that simple. CCP advertising is also VERY VERY misleading. It says the logins don't need to be consecutive, which, while technically true is misleading. The first time this happened I thought they meant as long as you log in during this period, you'll get the rewards. And thus I did not bother making sure I logged in every day to click my good boy monkey button for logging in. I didn't get the rewards due to misleading marketing. The fact that you think this is about entitlement is kind of sad.
---
It wasnt banning neutral structures from all of low sec, just the faction warfare zones. There is plenty of non faction warfare space in each empire that is not a part of the zone. The problem with keeping "neutral" structures in the war zone is alts. If you kept them and didn't at least ban milita pilots from docking, you would end up with the same problem.
---
That looks fun!
---
During that time, was there a mechanic where the moons were depleted? Where the regions that were rich in specific minerals lost those minerals as they were stripped? I don't believe so, and it is that change which I am proposing. The whole idea is to *encourage* mobility by making it so you can't just go "Yep, I found these two REALLY nice moons, upgraded this system to Military/Indy lvl 5, and have a couple good planets. I am set for the next 10 years and never have to leave my home system."
---
As for building caps in hisec... why? Is there a particular shortage of caps that they need to be built there? I personally feel like preventing them from being built in hisec means that people can attack cap-building facilities without worrying about the crummy wardec system, which seems important. It also encourages people to actually utilize and defend assets in low sec, which I am all about.
---
convert the titan's value to plex, now add the value of whatever you're protecting/trying to kill.  It's like throwing $600 on black but also 200-600 other people are also hedging their $600 bets at the same time on the same board. Now instead of a coinflip, the winner is decided over the course of 3-18 months of metagaming, pre-planning, and setup.  Then you drop the proverbial marble, grab some snacks, and watch your hard work play out in the 6-24 hour spin around the roulette table.
---
I was on four AT teams including Rote Kapelle's yes, and I was very definitely in that match with PL as well as many other Rote Kapelle matches until 2015.
---
MukkBarovian is probably the greatest small gang PvP FC I ever flew with. He ended up in PL but before that he was a chief FC in the old Gentlemen's Club alliance. I learned more about small gang from being in his fleets than from any other single source.
---
I do think the Triglavian shit is helping a ton with bringing back small gang content, I do wish (as I have for the last 10+ years) that they would fix shit that's broken and stop focusing so much on introducing new (broken) content.
---
You’re confusing political posting with shitposting
---
Well... He *does* know the Mittani after all... (it was Matterall, no?)
---
Having no capitals in low sec would be counter productive. I do like the idea of no supers in low sec though. There is a huge problem of what do you do about the existing ones? Trap them in the system they are in unless they cyno into null? This would be similar to what they did when capitals were allowed in high sec.
---
&gt; Can you prove it? 
---
I don’t know. I’ve never bothered to prove it, since it’s pretty obvious to anyone who spends more than a few days in Delve, or now Period Basis too.
---
I mean it’s obvious unless you’re intentionally avoiding looking for it.
---
&gt; that fallacy has been disproven by CCP itself.
---
Strictly speaking, what’s been proven is that Goons are conspicuously absent from the list of large alliances who have bitters banned from them. Anything else you draw from this is speculation. For example, one possible conclusion is that the other alliances are doing a much better job of reporting blue bots, making them less safe for botters than goons would be.
---
Just food for thought on that last bit.
---
Null is too organised and High Sec is too apathetic.
---
Also note that in my proposal, neutral toons can still dock in NPC stations :-).
---
Idk man, I feel like if you're going to plant a flag in the middle of a warzone, you should pick a side :-P
---
what module bro
---
It's more that we get some vague comment about out of game harassment with the only example being in the game. 
---
Like personally I'm a big fan of banning anybody for revealing, for example, another player RL name or any other out of game actions with the possible exception of that 1 guy that mailed a bag of dicks to the ccp office because that made me smile. ( like had he done it another player i would consider that bannable don't get me wrong )
---
Wouldn't this be a clear sign of that the game itself isn't refreshed enough for quality seekers to find the game?Instead of adding new content, or keeping with the old core fundamentals, shouldn't they try to go boldly forward?I know 64-bit will help greatly on this part for future coding, but don't you think they might be restraining themselves a bit too much?
---
Don't forget dropping them on a passing fleet. It's basically boson ratting cranked up to 8

The most bitter part is that this isk pays for evicting the smallest coalition that was left in the game to place even more campers into scalding pass and fighting them by killing their VNIs barely does anything.. and CCP doesn't do anything. Its hard to see cheaters wining the game.
---
Yes
---
woah woah, I orbit at about 2975 - have we been doing it wrong this whole time?

Well that one, of course

Ohgod yes this is so annoying :(

God I dumped so much money into plex to play somer. Won some, lost a bunch. One day I came back and they were shut down and I left before I could catch up on why. Thanks again for the ama
---
Lol what do you mean? frat couldn’t even evict BSOD or Right Order after a year and a half of trying. Scalding is more hostile to frat now than it was when I got there
---
I guess I mean what did CCP do to "close" it or what could they do to open it up more.
---
Thanks man! Have a good time winning Eve, and maybe I'll pew pew you on that last week (or when CCP decides small gang matters again). o7
---
Problem is most caps can tank a doomsday now so doing a drive by is not a carrier/dread kill for sure anymore

The UI was truly an abomination. Also, there was no explanation of anything and no resources anywhere so nobody knew what the fuck was going on. 
---
But, you know, that’s part of what made it so fun back then. There was no meta game, nobody knew anything, and it just felt like an infinite universe of possibility. I remember a group of us banded together in the Deven system to mine (because low sec had bistot back then...) until one day a mysterious pirate showed up and started shooting people. It was so shocking, like it had never occurred to any of us yet that such a thing was possible. 
---
The pirate was in a cruiser, which was the apex of power, and most of us didn’t even have any guns. There were many whispered private messages warning that she was employing devastating widowmaker missiles to destroy poor mining frigates. She eventually demanded payment for the service of leaving us alone, and we had little choice to accept. 
---
It’s hard to describe and maybe I just sound dumb at this point, but there was something about the monolithic lack of knowledge back then that just made everything seem so much bigger.
---
&gt;make it so each region has a mineral in it that no other one does,  that mineral is needed for ships specific to that region (nullsec close to amarr has stuff for amarr and blood raider ships. etc)  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;might be...a bit drastic of a change..but its there.
---
Literally used to be like that for space outside nullsec for regular mins and similar for moons.
---
Tree-fiddy
---
Nullsec is too even, wellfare online is not working at all, region with worst Super umbrella effectiveness should be the most richer in the game (like Deklein) that would either force people to live under a well perfect super umbrella or let their enemy with worst super umbrella live on a gold mine.
---
Nullsec should have interest conflict and not just political conflict like we have right now
---
I feel like we are in a point where Karmafleet will field more on TQ during the next big battle
---
Was more a counterproposal to the specific part about supers and titans. Lowsec is an important means to travel in eve both as a superblob and as an individual. Titans and supers would still be an issue, but they'd have to be either prestaged or gated in at risk and without instant support.
---
I appreciate the effort you and everyone else goes to when they post threads like this, I really do. It's heartwarming to see there are people who recognize the glaring issues that run rampant and are trying to do something about it. But you're missing a pretty crucial point in your thread: the biggest, most difficult problem with eve is that CCP don't see the problem with eve. They want to cater to 2 types of player, hardcore PVE and megacoalition level combat. They look at the numbers, they don't listen to the voices. The CSM being comprised largely of nullsov players with no experience in the other aspects of the game only furthers the issue.
---
Love it or leave it isn't a naive or combative statement. They're your only options. Unless of course you want to join the imperium and pay your tithes to get put on the officially endorsed CSM candidate list, then you can talk at CCP in person, and after a brief pop quiz they might just listen. Tho as I'm sure Jestertrek can testify they'll most likely just lie to your face about it all.
---
Or Rick Astley lyrics.
---
Can we get a story behind the $1000 floating nyx model?  
---
I think that was around your time in CSM
---
The bad old days certainly made stories :P My first day I joined a mining op where some guy in a bs was helping out noobs and he was mining in a domi and had a hauler. I was privately mad as he rounded down my 1037 isk payment to 1000 but didn't say anything and (apparently not) covertly went and "stole" a hobgoblin I from one of the rat cans. 15 years later neither of us plays eve atm and him not for near on a decade yet we are still great friends.
---
You're probably right. Outside of my own little private corp that my brother-in-law and I share, we both spent time with a pirate corporation in lowsec doing the yarr thing and then we joined a larger group out in nullsec for about 6 months and we were subordinate to Red Alliance. I don't recall much drama or issues other than the 2am CTAs and having to navigate a jump bridge network.
---
It's been good for us so far. I'm enjoying Abyssals and find them to be just the right amount entertainment whenever I run one. 
---
Good luck to you too!
---
NC justs wants to stab PH though, not that he's scared of the fight.
---
I'm playing devil's advocate a bit here, but trying to do it in a constructive manner. Forcing people into a nomadic gameplay style - even if that movement takes months before it happens - seems to me like a good way to discourage empire-building and investment into infrastructure like jump gates.
---
Lol good point
---
Maybe not regional exclusive but more prominent in different areas.
---
Don’t you think that is a bit game breaking? Like it is just a means to the end of eve?
---
OH BOY STORY TIME! 
---
Did someone already what was the story behind the eve trailer?
---
Don't forget, they gave token SP to people that were subbed on one day in the year and a half long clusterfuck failure!
---
to distract the enemy from my alts mining all their dank moons
---
Not wasted, I had fun playing to earn the isk to buy them.  Less than 300M mines and maybe 2B ratted over 3 years, so it wasn’t tedious grinding.  But it was work.
---
Now this is the beat eve can offer for a payoff to that work.  So.....meh...  we ride off to battle.
---
Do you guys get loot from big battles or does it all just go to the Corp? I am trying to figure out how a average player sustains a pvp habit without buying plex
---
The fix is simply to remove the mining ability of Rorquals in the first place. It alone killed off the need for Exhumers outside of Hi-sec.
---
I mean, that's exactly the point. What is the purpose of jump gates? To move from one system to another without endangering yourself by traveling through the intervening 6-8 systems (or more). What is that based in? Risk-aversion, which was one of my big targets during this post.
---
What do jump gates add to the game? Slightly faster travel time, occasionally interesting flanking maneuvers when enemies come into your space and don't realize that you can cut them off on their way out, but mainly it's risk prevention.
---
"Empire-building" means the people who built their empire in 2010 will always have an advantage over people who joined the game later. That stifles new player activity in favor of the old guard.
---
Yes but can they also simultaneously fight over a high sec keepstar??
---
It's the Nasty-Boyz way of saying juice.
---
&gt; Habit, friends, the sunk cost fallacy
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
You mentioned your playstyle isn't consistently attainable any longer in game.
---
What is your preferred playstyle? What activities and accomplishments in game give you the most satisfaction?
---
&gt; changing the war dec mechanics.
---
To be fair, war dec mechanics have been garbage since... well forever. Changing it, even if it isnt perfect, is better than doing nothing imo.
---
oh my it's a mistake
---
Harvesting the salt of your opponents as they turn to blame CCP for losing their super capital fleet.
---
Sounds similar to the system search shit CCP pulled.
---
"We fixed a bug that was letting you search for systems the way players refer to them as.  Don't like it, fuck off"
---
From another comment:
---
&gt; I joined EVE for micro-, small-, and medium-gang action, from fleet sizes of about four to fleet sizes of about 50 or so. That's the thing I loved about EVE, the fact that you can have a largish multi-player battle but still create a situation where every player has to do his or her part for the group to be successful. By contrast, once fleet sizes are past 50, individual members stop having any real impact and I hate that.
---
&gt; I'd consider coming back if a place was found for small-gang combats, and an in-game place was found for smaller alliances (250 to 400 people) who could hold small patches of space and yet still be independent of the larger alliances. I'd be OK if they were put in a situation where they could join a larger coalition for a major war -- I loved loved loved the fact that Low Sec Voltron manifested and was a maor player in WWB but could still operate independently of the big boys.
---
As for my personal highest satisfaction moments (the playstyle Jester describes is what I like to do as well): Winning against the odds because the people in your fleet/gang made good decisions *which mattered*. Being the 143rd battleship in a 255-man fleet means you are not personally impacting the outcome of the battle. Flying logi in a fleet of 20 characters (even though it's 100MN Gila's because you're like 7 real people) does.
---
yikes
---
&gt; he was a liar, but you can trust him, I know... But I can't give proof.
---
Yeah that doesn't change anything for me.
---
Those Caldari cruisers! My eyeeeees!
---
How we take symmetry in Caldari for granted nowadays.
---
Pretty sure we did that last time already
---
Care to elaborate? As a new player, my main barrier was how hard it is to even find fights. Flying from trade station to fighting area only to get blown up by a gate camp, or have an inferior enemy run away from you. Seems like you have to climb a mountain to get an actually fun and balanced fight.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
&gt;it’s like pos code only harder to cut out.
---
I still remember when they were tinkering with pos code and they made a change which basically resulted in gamewide overview instability. Like the game would just fucking throw up its hands with the overview "You're on your own!"
---
Yeah looks like we need to go back through our corporate branding to find the true distance
---
At the end of the day it's no different from the others.

If you have seen these botters, why have you not reported them?  If they actually WERE botting, then they would be banned.  You obviously do not know what a botter looks like in this case then.
---
Yeah, can't invest money in an old product, gotta piss it all away on 7 failed new projects!
---
this was a real idea??
---
&gt; We were shown *remarkable* things that  apparently would have been easily capable of the interconnection in a  relatively short time period. In particular, we were told that the code  capability of a DUST 514 mission to take over a supercarrier *while it was involved in a capital ship battle*  and to turn ownership of the ship to the winning side in the DUST 514  battle was not only possible, it was something that could be implemented  in a relatively short period (18 months). 
---
I kind of call bullshit on that ever actually working.  Technically DUST was so poor that it could barely handle what little it did without massive slowdown/crashes/etc.
---
&gt; Goonswarm Federation does not live in Period Basis.
---
Oh uh. Is that like, NC. Renter space down there then?
---
&gt; If you have seen these botters, why have you not reported them?
---
I have.
---
&gt; If they actually WERE botting, then they would be banned.
---
This sub: CCP needs to do more to ban botters, the report tool doesn’t work!
---
You: CCP bans all botters with a single report.
---
:thinking:
---
&gt; You obviously do not know what a botter looks like in this case then.
---
Maybe you’re right, never having botted I have no first hand experience. I can only see what looks oddly like a rorqual and numerous subs all synchronized swimming and dropping cans at the same time along with VNIs who are in warp the second my name appears in local to the same tether spot on a structure every time.
---
Certainly this is all just high skill play, but maybe since you seem to have first hand experience maybe you can tell me what botting looks like from the other side?
---
You're asking this, after they've pissed away EVE's profits into like 7 utter failures of games for like 5+ years straight?  OF COURSE they're retarded, current EVE is still running despite of CCP's best efforts, not because of them.
---
I'd disagree here i think the real nightmare cost wise would be that they would have to rebalance their sub/plex model to handle a new customizeable system and the loss they would eat from that be it from people paying less because their subs are tailored to what they want/need. 
---
Look at it like this, lets say i have 3 accounts: 1st  with 2 chars rorq + super. 2nd and 3rd each with 1 fax alt. Assuming i pay monthly thats approx $45. What that new system would have to do to be balanced is tailor the cost of Omega to the number of chars that have it at any given point. Since i can have a maximum of 9 chars on my three accounts that works to $5 per char for omega as it stands, meaning if i were to pay a similar rate for omega status in the new system it would be $20 for my 4 chars as i'd be paying per char. This now forces CCP to change the Training Queue price to stop people from making even more single char alts nuking their margins further.
---
The actual getting all char's on one account thing is actually easier than you'd think and would only require launcher tweaks as well as some slight modifications to the actual game itself.
---
That is pretty dumb logic for them.  Even if we ignore the end of life thing, the PS3 was far too weak technically for it to be a good platform for DUST anyway.  The game was a buggy, ugly mess, and it basically was pushing the system to its limits, so they couldn't really do anything special with it even if the console didn't die.
---
I like their name though

We already know that the PS3 was only part of the problem.  The game was coded so poorly Legion couldn't even work on PC.  There was just nothing that could handle Dust as it was written.

They look fine though. This is really another example of CCP having ways to make money off its players by selling models, posters, etc. and just being too lazy to do it.
---
"a little bit of buzz and excitement" doesn't pay the bills and CCP clearly decided to use that money somewhere else that had a better return.

Fun fact it took 22 concussion bombs in a manticore to kill the 4 battleships in a wormhole instrumental gas site. Making the site easily soloable yet time consuming.

Ran across about 15 off these accounts in Nulsec tonight, all in domis all warped out as i enter sys
---
First time flying the abyssal armor succ. I wasn't sure how well this flew and how hard it was to kill, so flew it very defensively. Additionally, first time flying a ship like this in a while, so my piloting was certainly sloppy in several places.  
---
Footage from 1 night/fight, obviously fighting outnumbered like we do in literally every fight we have as an alliance (not hard to outnumber us).
---
Not much comms since the video editor I used wasn't cooperative with multi track/multi layer audio (had to re-encode this video quite literally 20+ times to get the audio to work) and I didn't want to redo my work for the millionth time.
---
Will definitely be flying more of this ship, and likely flying more incredibly fast ships for future videos. 
---
Feel free to hang out in the ingame channels "Oatmeal" or "The-Envoys" if you want to chat or have any questions. :)

Yeah m8 we're fucking terrible. Not quite sure what you expect from a roughly 60-70 man alliance that can muster t1 ships against titans and entire capital fleets... We're just trying to figure things out against one of the biggest blocs in the game, and another very well developed low sec alliance that used to be named "kings of lowsec" no reason to hate.

Just get better every day.

Hi &lt;3 Snuffed tried to anchor an Astrahus off of our home systems fortizar for starters there was not final timer.
---
In test big capital ops means contract loot to the alliance executor corp. In smaller fights you get to keep it. Personally I just fly logi and dictors in fleets, they get very good srp: a sabre costs 78m, I platinum insure it for 3m: when it dies (and it does, I go on a lot of fleets and fraternity has a decided hatred of being waterboarded, something about flying AB eagles all the time I guess) and when I lose it insurance pays me 18m and alliance pays me 85m so I net 22m isk per sabre + whatever I sell loot for. I also casually seed doctrine contracts and as I scan for wormholes for alliance fleets run the occasional relic site.

Don't think we ever claimed to be "elite". Just a group of people enjoying EVE in the ways we can. Not everything needs to be super serious. Sometimes its nice to just have fun.

As someone who started playing in 2008, this caused me to unsub all of my accounts. While I played off and on through the years after I definitely never got back to where I was. Now much like Jester I’m currently winning with no hope of small hang ever getting fixed.

yeah we aware...

I guess I should show off my EON collection next

It was the first time they actually decided to take the fight against us and it went well. Its not like we have a plethora of experience fighting them.

Anybody thought about maybe tripling the amount of solar systems in the game?

*There are 23 editions and 2 are not in this picture. I also had a poster signed by the CCP team that CCP Falcon had sent me a long while back. Frustratingly I cannot locate the last 2 copies or the signed poster.

Faction Warfare has way to much potential for not only new players but veterans who get burnt out on Sov grinding/null sec living. Unfortunately it’s been left behind as the game and development is geared towards null sec empires. 
---
I’m not sure if you’re in it or not, but check out the new attempt to stir up chatter about Faction Warfare: https://discord.gg/RR56Spn
---
I like the no capitals, or at least supers in Faction Warfare. It makes sense, if the empires banned them from high sec surely they’d ban them in an area of space that the empires are constantly contesting.
---
I cannot locate the last 2 copies as well as a signed poster CCP Falcon sent me a long while back with the CCP team's signatures. Gotta keep digging.

Reminds me of dealing with CCP recently. I sold a bunch of stuff on market to buy orders and my wallet wasn't credited. Checked everything, even corp wallet, nothing. Opened a ticket and asked them to fix it and was told, "give us a list of all the stuff you sold and we'll get right on it".  
---
I don't keep track of that shit, and you guys are the ones with access to the logs. AFAIK there's no way to see a record of all the stuff you've sold so what gives?
---
Well this last couple days has been my first venture in killing krabs.  Never realized it was this bad.
---
Each of the 4 t3c has 4 slots, 3 possibilities each so 4x3^4 which equals 324 restrooms, assuming each one is the bare minimum to comply with the ADA, at 30 by 48 inches, if they were all end to end they would stretch nearly a quarter of a mile. A bit farther than id like to walk to go to the fuckin bathroom.

Thanks, Syco. &lt;3

if something like that was to occur (new space without capitals, content for the little guy kinda thing) could you see eve's population improving at all?

Same again, but could you see yourself coming back to eve to champion something like that?

Those two statements are mutually exclusive.

Resource depletion is a good way to hasten the arrival of a mono-bloc nullsec.   
---
Smaller entities would be forced to bend the knee or be steamrolled for access.  
---
The only reason gewns don't own null atm is bc they either just don't care or see the value in allowing some resistance to exist. The game flew too far off its rocker with citadels, titans and rorquals. Gewns mastered the meta first and here we are.

Orbital bombardment was working. That is less complicated than the other way around.

&gt;fix fw  
---
  
---
its not just fw though, lowsec used to hold relatively valuable stuff that people would fight over in general. that's not really the case as much anymore.  
---
this problem centralizes around supercapital/capital proliferation. there was a time in this game not so long ago where you could actually go into enemy space and it was fairly risky for them to drop supers on you because competent nomadic alliances had staged counter forces in many places around the game. if they noticed you were dropping on cruiser gangs with your two unsupported hels, theyd just bait and drop you with a massive fleet. typically this was possible because the idea that every single person in alliance could farm up and inject an apostle/minokawa in like a week didn't exist at that time. if you dropped on someone there's a distinct possibility there wouldn't be enough people active without a ping going out to save you  
---
the point is that to survive/excel in lowsec you have to put out a lot of effort as a small alliance. its possible but it just really doesnt have that much appeal to anyone. on the pve side, you're immediately at a disadvantage because you could farm easier and with less risk in nullsec, and the amount of counterplay at the top level of the game's meta is fairly limited unless you happen to outplay them pretty badly into getting trapped in really shitty circumstances.  
---
&gt;scarcity  
---
arguably no longer a viable strategy. there's simply so much isk in the game right now that some alliances could simply move regions in massive numbers of rorquals in order to strip ore from it in a few hours. we see that in particular with one alliance happening right now. there's also the idea that if this took place, yes a group might leave their space after it was depleted but... would anyone go through the trouble to take the now worthless space back? what would be the point in holding the sov there if there was simply nothing to gain from taking it?
---
without significant corp/alliance reworks i sincerely doubt you'll see any meaningful impact on the topography of nullsec even if the devs implemented all the changes you wanted and more.
---
We all said injectors were a mistake, but they were done for a reason. Got to keep the lights on.

---
In the wallet tab it used to be under transactions and then would say what it was.
---
But if the wallet has nothing in it then there's nothing there which means the best thing you can do is lie and profit off the situation so that suddenly they do have logs!
---
Alliances usually take capital loot, particularly if they provide things like dread or FAX caches that they can put the parts to use in.
---
In large blocks, people get SRP when they die so pvping in big fights doesn't cost anything except time
---
This is the mindset of easily 90% of EVE players, though...

First, not all Chinese people believe there was a massacre in 1989. Some Chinese believe the so-called "Tiananmen massacre" is one of those "western propaganda" (note that I'm not here to debate on if they are right or not on this, I am just pointing out what people are thinking); Second, it's about Chinese culture - people tend to see the Chinese people and the Chinese government as a whole when talking about things related to foreigners. That means, even when some foreigners think "we are just attacking the Chinese government, by doing that we are helping the Chinese people for freedom", Chinese people will think "If we don't like our government we will protest, but that's China's internal affairs and nothing to do with you foreigners. If you foreigners are attacking the Chinese government, then you are attacking China as a whole, which includes us common Chinese people". Third, people find that most of those who keep bringing up "Tiananmen massacre" do not actually care about what that event is or what that means for Chinese people - they just think it's fun to troll Chinese player and that's all, which is disrespectful. Think about it, for those who believe that massacre doesn't exist, these foreigners are just talking bullshit; and for those who do believe that massacre exists, these foreigners are making fun of a massacre where many people died in that event, which also makes people angry.

I think so. She was the first CSM Chair to bring a true sense of process and actual leadership to the team. She set expectations for what the CSM should do -- have meetings, have townhalls, engage with CCP on a specific schedule -- and then she held CSM members accountable for doing those things and made it stick.
---
Without Mynxee, there would have been no CSM Chair Mittens. I don't think the idea of being even *more* public than Mynxee would have occurred to him or to anyone.
---
y'all either got METAtrolled or this guy has some emotional issues : /
---
Jester,
---
Not a question, but some of best time playing was when just starting and doing some level 4 missions.
---
You took an incredible amount of time to help new players to the corp for mission mondays... Was awesome.
---
Never really recaptured that magic.
---
So um.... Thanks.
---
First reddit post here.
---
I can agree that a scenario in which someone does something in another game to affect EVE is impressive. I remember the scenario which involved EVE capitals shooting a planet on which people were fighting. That sounded impressive. Two separate games interacting. 
---
However in the example given - a specific scenario in which I am flying a supercarrier and someone playing another game takes it over, specifically I lose control of it - that would make me want to quit EVE. Maybe that is harsh, I do like the game a lot. Perhaps I'd hang on and not use supers, I don't know. Regardless I feel that is a horrible situation and I am glad it isn't happening. 
---
If I am playing EVE and I lose a ship I better be the one in control of that ship. Not someone in another game I am not playing. If I am at risk in EVE I can at least try to get reps, warp out, fight back etc. Attacked from another game I am not playing? No options? I hope it never happens.
---
I don’t know who you are Ludus, but you are an ok person on my book now.
---
What game do we play now?
---
Very common issue, doesn't really affect anything but if you want those boxes checked off just go do career agents at one of the other locations and remember to use those missions to start each one. Each npc faction has 3 sets of agents so there's 12 total you can do.
---
Yep.
---
Advice: Don't
---
He is a god amongst us mere mortals duh.
---
Really? Is it that bad? Lol
---
Please do! This is awesome. I want to read all about it
---
edit: aren't you that guy who knows The Mittani?
---
They are a great bunch of people to fly with!
---
I thought about that, but I went to another career agent. But every time I hit request mission the only thing that happens is the AI window pops up to explain career agents. Close the window and nothing else opens. Hit accept mission and it just repeats.
---
Is it still broken? I need to know what to expect before I log in to EVE.
---
So, I don't play even more but I want to tell you how he's made me a better person.
---
Well, at least a more successful person. I work in it support for a long time. Anyone who knows anything about it knows that that it's help desk and that it's often a terrible job.
---
But I started playing Eve, then I got drugged into the North, and BoB, and then ASCN, and on and on until dreddit and goons. not being a good pilot I ended up doing logistics. At first it was chips and ammo, and then T2, and then capital ships, and then super capital ships, and before I knew it I had 12 jump freighter pilots moving massive amounts of ammo for huge battles. 
---
God damn, I took all the things I learned and I got a job at a trucking company as a freight auditor using some of the Excel sheets and skills that I built for running our small alliance market. 
---
A year later I had a chance and impresses some people in the pricing department, again using the exact same tools are used in Eve. I moved over and became a pricing analyst and I managed to score some very big wins by borrowing liberally from both the concepts and the actual tools used for my market activities. 3 years later I was the director of the pricing and rates Department responsible for pricing 120 million dollars a year in products and services. 
---
And then up to being the director of planning and analysis setting goals for a 300 million dollar a year company. By this time and Eve I was moving materials in and out of wormhole and null space turning over 150b a week and  running production and POS logistics for huge operations.  I used the exact same skills and many of the same tools to totally overhaul our operations and how we handled back haul loads. Easily 10 million dollars a year to the bottom line.
---
We were  acquired by the 3rd largest logistics companies in the United States a few years ago, and a tremendous amount of the value that caused them to buy us can trace its roots back to skills I mastered in battleship and capital ship production. 
---
Obviously the story stretches over a long period of time but I don't think our company would have survived the great recession if I hadn't been able to leverage those Eve online skills to help us early on with our logistics offering, and at least three of my major accomplishments literally came from spreadsheets that were originally created for Eve markets. 
---
That is how Eve made my life better.
---
(On mobile, apologies for spelling or grammar errors)
---
&gt;The thing CCP thought they could do was pull everything into EVE, do everything with one client, do everything within one game. It was ambitious as hell... probably more ambitious than is currently technically possible and certainly more ambitious than what CCP the company was capable of.
---
So CCP pulled a Star Citizen before Robert Space Industries?
---
&gt;The thing with character creation is that EVE has to give you a connection to something other than your ship. When players identify too much with their ships, they're not willing to see them explode which is of course the whole point to the game for a large segment of the player base. So their ship explodes and they get upset and quit. The point to character creation is to get these people focused on the character instead of the ship. It was felt that WiS would emphasize that.
---
That actually makes WiS sound good. 
---
And it makes the all the clothing and apparel make a lot more sense now.
---
Well.... am I wrong?
---
What were ideas if any that CCP acknowledged or considered viable for low sec space to revitalize it during your term?
---
Would you say Systems wide cyno like in incursions in new space(or in parts of low sec) would help giving some breathing room against capital blobs giving room for some sub cap quality roams?
---
Ferewell hope we see you again

You get emotional issues! You get emotional issues! WE ALL GET EMOTIONAL ISSUES!
---
I have no problem with damage caps. They exist for one reason: to prevent a massive alliance from one-cycling a structure, which happened routinely with all but the most dickstar POSes. This denies the defending group the chance to respond and actually have a fight.
---
Asset safety, likewise, has to be there for reasons that I've posted about a lot. Notably, it has to exist so that people can feel comfortable leaving their stuff in citadels even if they have a car accident, their wife gets pregnant, their unit deploys to Afghanistan, or any number of other RL emergencies that come up suddenly and last a long time.
---
Could dump them into a one-of free asset safety, then can be undocked from anywhere it can be legitimately claimed. Really, the introduction of the asset safety system actually makes crazy decisions like this a lot more viable.
---
 Correct, it says on the referral page for any purchase through the eve website you receive the rewards.
---
TIL how to say your name
---
Yes.
---
M8 I think his emotions are enough of a minefield without him playing a game about it.
---
This isn't a bad question, but it's two layers of hypothetical too high to really think about. It would be really nifty but some of the existing players would probably scream about "noob zones" and "instanced servers" and the like. So it's too unlikely to happen to really think seriously about.
---
funny how an alliance that once hated another alliance so much because of the power they once held...and managed to end them by a click of a button...ends up being just like said alliance, yet is able to spin it like they are the good guys
---
all in all tho if it were not for my internet spaceship enemies(EVE friends) i really don't think i would be playing this game

As a player of more than 10 years and up until now the recent owner/operator of a small high sec indy corp, I do agree, but at the same time I feel it does not go far enough.  Cloaking, Warp Scrambling and War all need to be reworked, and they need to reduce the gaps in the security of system so the leaps from high to low, and low to null are not as sever as they are.  Below are some of my thoughts to add as long as we are griping.  :)
---
War, especially in high sec is more broken now than it was for smaller corps.  Most small corps had to get rid of their high sec structures just to not be perpetually war decced.  The real fix to this is to put a cap on the number of wars you can have active.  Once a corp reaches this cap, say 10, they can no longer declare a war.  Capped corporations can still be war decced, and mutual wars do not count towards this cap.  Now as it stands, any corp in high sec that wants a structure will be perpetually at war with griefers just because there are now fewer targets for the griefers to harass.  
---
"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction"  No system in Eve should be allowed without a counter system.
---
1. Complete rework of Warp cores and warp scrambling. Larger ships will have more cores. To stop them you need scramblers with more power or more scramblers.  Many younger players would love to venture into null, few of them last beyond the first gate camp.  Why, there is no counter for warp bubbles except really good capabilities in hitting certain keys.  The fix is below, numbers are just ones I put in there to help explain.
---
 Ship Sizes
---
   1. Shuttles = 1 Core
---
   2. Frigates and Destroyers = 2 cores
---
   3. Cruisers and Battle Cruisers = 4 Cores
---
   4. Battleships = 6 cores
---
   5. Lower Capitals (Freighters, Orcas) = 8 Cores
---
   6. Carriers and Dreadnaughts = 12 Cores
---
   7. Super Carriers = 16 Cores
---
   8. Titans = 25 cores
---
Scramblers and disrupters will now come in multiple styles and sizes with the ones capable of scrambling the most cores require the most energy to use.
---
   1. Small Disrupter = 2 cores, designed to fit on frigates and above
---
   2. Medium Disrupter = 4 cores, 2x the energy needed as small, Designed to fit on cruisers and above
---
   3. Large Disrupter = 8 cores, 2x the energy needed as medium, designed to fit on Battleships and above
---
   4. Interceptors will get a reduction in the amount of energy used by Disrupter and scramblers as well as any other mods that help that to enable them to tackle much larger ships than others can with the same size scramblers.
---
   5. Scramblers use 10% more energy and have half the range, but double the cores they scramble.
---
Bubble Types
---
   1. Warp disruption bubbles of all types will no longer be total scramble of cores, but will now come in various sizes and strengths also
---
      1. Tech 1 Small, 5k        range, 6 Cores scrambled
---
      2. Tech 2 Small, 7.5k range, 8 Cores scrambled
---
      3. Tech 1 Medium, 10k range, 4 Cores scrambled
---
      4. Tech 2 Medium, 15k range, 6 Cores scrambled
---
      5. Tech 1 Large, 20k range, 2 Cores scrambled
---
      6. Tech 2 Large, 25k range, 4 Cores scrambled
---
   2. Higher skill levels will also enable players to have more bubble active
---
Lastly, a more scaled security rating.1.0 should be very secure with even ganking being tough, and .4 should not be as far from .5 as it is.  This can be done by reworking CONCORD and its reactions.  An example is that in 1.0 and .9 there are towers in the system for near insta-warp scramble, and insta-jam.  By the time you get to .1 is may take concord several minutes to get some frigates on the seen.  This will allow players more options when deciding how to proceed down the safety levels on their own pace.  Other options I was thinking about in this would be to not only have different things trigger the different flags, but as I said different response types from CONCORD, but new system instead of just the slow response forces that show up.  
---
Last is not a gripe, or real flaw, but the belt rats need to be worked over.  In a .5 system 2 measly little frigs show up to mess with me, not even close to challenging.  Belt rats should not be absolute death, but at least provide something that poses a bit of a challenge to botters.
---
I think that's the problem of translation. The word "民族" here is not the exact same with the English word "Ethnic". While "民族" can mean things like "Ethnic" or "Race", in some cases it can refer to "中华民族", which means all Chinese people, including all Chinese citizens and sometimes it even includes foreign citizens of Chinese origin.
---
um, he scored even bros.  Sorry but you don't post on reddit about that.
---
Though nice job finally getting those supers to drop at least.  I'm still proud of ya!
---
My guess would be that at the time dps and healing meters were all the rage. 
---
Healing meters in particular lead to lots of consternation and min-maxing. In WoW's case, this leads to several aggressive iterations about how healers do what they do. It wasn't the only reason, but it was a contributing factor.
---
I imagine a lack of accountability for healers may be key to avoiding the reactions to accountability among healers. For better or worse. Or at least the theory would go.
---
For the record, I don't actually agree with this position.
---
The side with more supers and carriers nearly lost the same amount of isk value...?
---
I guess it's just one of those bait titles or you're dumb.
---
It's an endless issue, in the current state of the game, and with CCPs revenue sources mainly being injector based, there is no way to fix it as is.
---
Just report as you can and murder bots where you can. That's about it.
---
[deleted]
---
I like your proposals, it would be nice if anybody at CCP would try and do something about these issues, but I sort of doubt it myself being mostly pessimistic.
---
Elo excels at losing supers. He's a pro. This isn't worth a reddit post.
---
erhm....you guys lost more ships in your home system...... and 1B difference? I dont see a baiting here but a feeding to a hot drop :/
---
At least we had two dictors to bubble the Hel
---
Guys, this one elite Hel cost you to much,  not in your position to brag about it...
---
dang you guys are so quick with the memes....slow with the form...could had saved those 2 rorquals :)
---
For suggestion I.5, a better solution is to restrict structure anchoring in FW space to members of FW militias, **set per-system structure limits**, and then require all hostile structures in a system to be destroyed before the system is fully captured. Maybe systems that are more than 10%-25% contested would prevent players from anchoring new structures and if a system is fully contested (100% held by the opposite side) all structures enter low power mode.
---
This would allow for the additional strategic depth added by Upwell structures to be balanced by the concerns you stated, would give more meaning and more weight to each structure (**especially with per-system structure limits**) and possibly require militias to coordinate with each other, give a mechanic to reduce structure grind (which is a pain in the *ass*), and overall improve the system.
---
The main issue I see with suggestion II.2 is that there is a fairly simple solution to it: Crop rotation. Most vast nullblocks hold massive amounts of territory that goes essentially unused, rented out to other corps or alliances only because the "owning" nullblock doesn't have the ability to stretch their industrialists that thin but does have the resources to move their fleets there. This change would just see large nullblocs claiming vast swathes of otherwise empty territory inhabited only by the occasional Fort or Keepstar used for staging and rapid deployment, then changing the area they actively exploit every 4-6 months. While this would in theory make them more vulnerable and is the best solution to the problem (don't @ me), the underlying problem of large power blocs being too viable would remain.
---
Another solution that should be developed in parallel is breaking up nullsec, making transportation and deployment significantly more difficult. Give us fleets of thousands of Triglavians shutting down gate connections and requiring massive manpower commitment to defeat, making it all but impossible to control more than two or three constellations at a time. As tired and cliche as the "wormholes are better than you" meme is (and, more to the point, how not entirely accurate it is), you don't see massive power blocs forming in wormhole space precisely because capturing and holding large amounts of territory is nearly impossible in wormholes.
---
Another change that would complement this one would be developing resource heterogeneity. Right now nullsec is pretty much homogenous in terms of the resources you can exploit in any particular area. On the system-to-system and even, to some extent, constellation-to-constellation level resources are heterogenous but on the whole resource distribution is purely homogenous. You make many parallels to real life and this I feel is an important one. Not only are human resources limited but they are not evenly distributed and this has historically driven not only conflict but trade, two very important content generators in EVE. If we distribute resources heterogenously and ensure that no single region contains every ore we can create a massive driver of conflict.
---
oh snap shots fired!!!
---
I was in tears for a good 15min after reading that part
---
Someone contact dr phill
---
Do you like the taste of anus?
---
Yeah that frustrated me too. Small alliances, local conflict was what I wanted. I wish players would have bought into it but apparently big bloc politics and amassing lots of allies is more fun.
---
At 50% efficiency, while operating under the enemy umbrella, I'd say he came out on top m8.
---
The monochrome shit is the worst UI change the EVE dev team has ever made.  And that says a LOT, considering 90% of their UI changes are shit-tier garbage.
---
Are goons too busy mining to jerk each other off about how much they mine?
---
&gt; whole lot easier for smaller groups and Alliances to move in and contest said space.
---
why would small groups move in if the space is shit? Imagine being a small alliance and trying to build up by only running hubs, mining regular gneiss or whatever, or mining r16s. meanwhile, the alliance that left previously is mining some fresh r64s in a new region.
---
Do you mean as opposed to that one time when somebody tackled a super and there was like only 1 dictor? 😂
---
&gt; Because at that time, believe it or not, E1 was actually not very well-known at all. **There was no Reddit at that time...**
---
uh... maybe not for you.
---
I tried bombing them on the gate, no clue where my bomb went lol..
---
Pin this fucking post hoooly moly

From what I’ve read goons and tapi are butt buddies, the Chinese are a huge bloc with tons o botters, and everyone else is irrelevant.

True or false, other posters?

just think, if the hel actually had ascendancies he might have gotten away, and your "bait" would be 15b lost to nothing killed. A+ work

This is only true if you assume CCP cares about anybody who isn't a miner/ratter in a nullsec alliance.

Nah think I will run locates on him and then we can play some more

your not wrong, but some resource scarcity could help. problem is telling when we go to far

you were exploded before your bomb went off, rendering it inert

Yeah but I think they no longer exist.  I contacted the guy that worked for them android these magazines, and he didn't know who had the rights, he figured ultimately it was CCP, but I'd welcome info on that.  If I can, I want to get permission to publish these digitally for free, so everyone can have them.

I dont think Dr. Phill can do shit here.... He's way too far gone for that one. He would just scream for the entire show in 5 word snatches.

As a follow up question do you think that making the map larger would help inspire localized fights? Or would it just spread larger groups thinner to the point of apathy?

Just like open offices are industry standard.   Whoops, studies are showing they're terrible and kill productivity.  Monochrome garbage is just the current "shiny" trend, it has nothing to do with it actually being good.

There are 2 sets of rewards. You'll get rewards when your recruit buys anything/PLEX/Omega from the CCP website, but there are also rewards for 1/2/5/10/... of your recruits upgraded to Omega (in any way). If you plexed the recruit, you won't get the first set, but you might get one of the milestone rewards.

Should’ve been more diligent

Congrats on Winning Eve.

I came to the game far too late to witness it at its greatest, but when I did start the game I devoured any and all knowledge I could find. 
---
One of the most influential tidbits of info I found was your (by then outdated) blog. Your pvp 101 and ship fitting theory posts had such an impact, that still to this day its required reading for my newbros.
---
I wish you could have finished the series out all the way like you planned.
---
My question (if it's not too late to answer) would be, was there ever a time in eve where you did something either so incredibly dumb (or any epic win) that afterwards you just had to sit back and say "I cant believe I just did that."
---
Normally there would be an obligatory can I have your stuff comment here, but I dont think I would worthy to deserve to hold a piece of your legacy. However I did see in one comment something about an isk prize for an essay (was 750 bil but now its 150b or something like that). If that's still on the table, PM me the details/guidelines and I'll write my little black heart out. My corp still tries to hold on to the small roaming gang/blackops playstyle and 150b would go a long way to supporting my linemembers in their endeavours.
---
Huh they broke it then, used to be that was the fix. You'll need to submit a ticket and they'll probably reset the career agents entirely.
---
I would like to see ore anoms, and rat anoms stop spawning as much, after a period of extreme activity. This already happens to a degree, in wormhole space. It can happen in null, too.

I think this is the right idea, you can keep your super cap for local superiority but it also puts a giant target on them if you leave them in ls as people will eventually know where it is.
---
Welcome to r/eve, and may god have mercy on your soul.
---
Anyway, I would argue that should be the risk of undocking in a supercapital class ship. Great power should also have great risk. Right now the only counter to a fleet of supers is a larger number of supers, and that's both fucking lame and helping to lead us into a galactic stalemate.
---
I agree with most of what you said, but I don't think there's anything wrong with goons using their numbers and organizational skills to construct a damn near impenetrable fortress. The problem is, no other groups are even really trying to compete except TEST. I'm not a part of these groups, so maybe I'm way off, but NC/PL and their friends seem to be sticking with the archaic "we only pvp, so elite" mentality, despite it being clearly non-viable in the current meta. Get it together.
---
The way I look at it, there is no separation between PvE and PvP in EVE. Everything you do can be described as competing against other players, from "market pvp" to collecting resources to build/buy ships and construct citadels and other infrastructural hardware. PvP is not merely shooting at ships.
---
Weren't there private servers for a bit that were a couple expansions behind?
---
That is a particularly poor edit, do you know that?
---
&gt; Then I’m going to come ~~kick your~~ mine in that ass!
---
Really? I have to be impressed by that? For sure I’m kicking your ass.
---
Truth be told, I already have a Rokh, but I can’t get back to where that ship is, so I’m going to have to build me a new one.
---
Then we’re going to see who’s really good at PvP.
---
Multiple reloads fixed it lol, the solution was to get a mission from another career agent (once it would allow me to)
---
Imagine being this unpleasant lmao you must have a lot of friends
---
Yeah that's what I was trying to suggest, go to a different career agent system and request it there. Cause each empire has 3 sets of 5 career agents.
---
Panfam's still hanging on for now, and the Chinese are split between Frat, which is anti-Tapirium, goons, and GOTG, which is pro-Tapirium. There's also our newest major addition as PIBC have hopped over from Serenity and promptly joined the biggest blue(tral) blob in the game.

Why is /u/ccp_peligro completely worthless at his job?

So that instead of having 70% of the systems be empty you can have 90% of the systems be empty?

How does it feel to be on the side of the botters now?

I wonder, how much did your morals cost?

I usually recommend the Meteor pack as it hits all three rewards as long as you buy it from eveo.com

The fact that this much-wanted feature by players got axed not because of technical reasons, because some assclown dev's personal hate for the idea, makes me lose what little faith I have left in CCP.

I'm in FRT, not NC....

Your best bet is probably to contact one of the old board members. It was a very small company.

Minor point of correction, it goes directly towards replacing lost capitals first, then things that aren't useful are sold to help offset srp for the rest with cash.
---
To be fair, the people that made EVE successful have been gone for a long, long time.  The current idiots are still somehow floating on the original devs' ideas, despite their efforts to destroy the game.
---
What side are you on?

I have only ever worked in open offices. Would be weird for me not to. Specially if you work in a tight team.

The truth can be a hard to take in, I know.

Mission agent access (faction replaces corporate when higher), including epic arcs.
---
Locator agent access (same as mission agents).
---
Broker fee reductions.
---
There's one-time COSMOS mission for faction BPC (navy cruiser and navy battleship).
---
The only other thing I can think of is requirements for faction warfare, but that's pretty low (1.0 I think).

&gt;Whether you think this particular idea was bad is kind of irrelevant.
---
It isn't really, though, because you mention players are partially at fault for not using the busted ass shit first iteration.  The problem is that most of the time CCP implements something, it is either a straight up bad idea (and no iteration is going to fix it), or it is released in such a broken ass form that it would take dozens of iteration passes to be even be worth using, you can't fault players for not wanting to be unpaid alpha testers for a year+ while CCP may or may not iterate on a bad feature.  Especially when they are often given tons of feedback on why something is bad and/or missing feature parity for whatever :new idea: is replacing, and CCP's response is "we don't care, we think its a good idea, HTFU"
---
Well done :) coolest frigate in the game. Do I detect the faint aroma of snakes??
---
I don't personally own a Titan, but the biggest thing I've ever owned was a single Rorqual I saved and trained for. I'm still in that wonderful stage where it feels good to fly something as big as an Orca and I'm proud of my small corp's ability to put up a handful of structures. Regardless, it feels good owning something big and powerful that you worked hard to get to and it feels even better to actually get to use it. If I ever do end up owning a Titan I look forward to dropping it in a big fight, just for the thrill of being able to fly something that big and that capable.
---
tbh i dont see the revert to smaller skirmishes happening until the playerbase is almost nulled and the game is on its last legs
---
(generally) people have never wanted permadeath, while it is a good bonus to the gameplay, and the ones who do exploit the shit out of it with super dumb fucking gimmicks that shouldnt exist (almost everything surrounding lowsec FW and the beacons, the beacons being deadspace and using LR machs with a dumbass web frig or cloaking logi frigs in a novice ect). this leads the average man to be super risk averse and move to a more friendly to "not losing everything every time you undock" alliances like tapi and goons, thus deepening the problem. 
---
i cant exactly explain why this wasnt so much of a thing before back in like 2006, because it was, it just didnt seem so evident i guess.  injector babies definitely didnt help that

My suggestion would be to goto /r/Evejobs join a corp and start learning with a group. 
---
Join either a small group, or even a larger one like Karma Fleet. And ask for help.

IMO learning to do it all by ur self without a community will be boring and you will give up.

I'd say to look at the market and find a few things with high demand and a decent margin. Spreadsheets are your friend. You can't go wrong with ammunition since it always has a constant demand and it's worth selling in major mission hubs since people are lazy and you can make a decent margin on the markup. Some corps offer blueprint libraries to their members, I know mine does, and that's a decent way to avoid spending a pretty penny on BPs.

Thanks for the kind words. :-)

So those who don't want to risk 200M isk in a fight with unknown enemy forces while they're trying to make isk for plex and other stuff, are bots? You are literally describing normal behavior and not bothering to point out what specifically made these guys you found, bots.

I agree that capital proliferation is a major issue but I don't feel losing a ship to someone in another game is the way to fix it.

You are just an entitled little bitch and microtransactions and CCP giving away free shit have nothing to do with one another.
---
&gt;Is it generally better to mine the minerals or just to buy them.
---
It doesn't matter since it's all the same cost to you. When you mine minerals for use in industry you're essentially buying them from yourself at standard market value, since you could make the market value of the minerals just selling them on the market.
---
Never forget opportunity cost. Nothing is free.

From the ocean rose a giant,From the acorn, quickly sprouting,Mighty Tursas, tall and hardy,Grows the oak-tree, tall and stately,Pressed compactly all the grasses,From the ground enriched by ashes,That the maidens had been raking,Newly raked by water-maidens;When a fire within them kindles,Spread the oak-trees many branches,And the flames shot up to heaven,Rounds itself a broad corona,Till the windrows burned to ashes,Raises it above the storm-clouds;Only ashes now remainingFar it stretches out its branches,Of the grasses raked together.Stops the white-clouds in their courses,In the ashes of the windows,With its branches hides the sunlight,Tender leaves the giant places,With its many leaves, the moonbeams,In the leaves he plants an acorn,And the starlight dies in heaven.[1]

If you're just scanning stuff down, get the right fit on a t1 or t2 frigate and cloaking if you're omega. once you're in, bookmark the wormhole as your exit and get a few safe spots down in the system. start scanning and watch the d-scan. warp out if you see anyone. loot the cans and profit!

So you would make holding sov even more temporary than it already is? No single entity I can think of holds the same space now as they did in 2010; even the holdings of *Provibloc* have shifted and changed since then. The Imperium has held Delve for only *three years*. What do you propose to do about "old guard" market traders whose wealth rests mostly in trade hubs?
---
Jump gates are an *asset sink*; they consume materials, ISK, or both to construct and operate. Being able to move more quickly around the space you live in is an incentive *to own space.*
---
It's become clear to me that you don't actually *play* in nullsec, nor do you consider how your changes will affect new players. Moving every *X* months is a pain for someone who owns two supercarriers, sure, but what about for someone who doesn't own a carrier yet? Moving jump by jump in EVE is an arduous, thankless task; much of the reason alliances don't deploy all the time is because it's not *fun.* How would forcing people to move all of their everything every few months be fun? How would that not contribute to both new *and* old players burning out and quitting?

For those who don't know roids are not always the same. The same amount of ore is kept clusterwide, but every downtime the amount of a certain type that was extracted can appear anywhere that has an open location. Put another way that rock that you poped yesterday will not always be pyro. The fact that you poped a pyro rock though means there will be a pyro rock somewhere in the cluster tomorrow that wasnt there at downtime.

If moon mining worked like this then there would be no inherently poor regions. I don't think that a downtime to downtime check is enough time to actually change moons much. a longer time span would have to be used.
---
Also regarding upwell structures in fac war space, the game already has a standing system why not use it? Make it so for all of lowsec a corporation has to set the empire that owns the space to a certain level. Make it so corporations cant have high enough standings with both sides of a fac war. Add in a standing hit every time that a corporation lowers its standing towards an empire; change to often and your whole corp can get shot by faction police and cant join fac war.

Embrace the spod, love the spod, be the spod.
---
What’s a spod? Lmao
---
hate to break it to you, but there are many, many tried-and-true strategies for avoiding/breaking through gatecamps, and how would you even "remove" it? Prevent people from deploying bubbles near gates? What distance? Just on grid at all? Prevent ships from having fast locking speeds? Prevent warp disruptors from working near gates? They would have to completely destroy the game to implement this change, and it would *certainly* be contrary to my goal of "less risk aversion."
---
Yes, if your bomb lands at 0 on the gate, it does 0 dmg.

Spod is the endgame boss for miners. It the rocks you'll spend 80% mining if you mine in nulsec.

Yeah, I agree that is not racist. You can see that in this Mango announcement, it says "upgraded war hatred to '民族' hatred" ("把战争仇恨升级为民族仇恨"). If you look at Google translate, the word "民族" means both "Nationality" and "Ethnic group". So I guess a more proper translation of this sentence should be "upgraded war hatred to nationality hatred".
---
That would be amazing! Raevon arsten in game

i'm not talking about complaints, you derp

kids with guns are definitely botters, no one disputes that, it's right there in the stats.
---
but if you think they're bad wait until you hear about this one group that has 2.5x as many permanent bans as they have, but in 1/3rd the time, fraternity
---
you should ask elo about them, he's part of that group, he probably knows all about the bots
---
CCP really needs to rework VNI, like, give it hybrid + drone damage bonuses, same to a regular vexor
---
Yeah that may shift the subcap ratting meta into Gila and Myrmidon, but the former will cost botters more and the second is bad at applying damage

---
You forgot nerfing power projection, which has been experimentally observed to have the effect you want.
---
Ccp got irl scammed lol
---
Well, most people pve only to fund pvp ships. And mining isn’t the most efficient way to make isk really, not unless you’re using several accounts or a rorqual. 
---
Gas huffing in wormholes in a venture can be ok, but generally requires being in a WH Corp with people to clear out the npcs for you, and moon mining in a procurer is also decent but you can only do it when there’s a moon up, normal mining won’t be great. 
---
However, with all the VNI/anom nerfs, it might not be as bad as it was when I started. 
---
But, imo the best way to make isk is still exploration. It takes a while to get good at, but once you do 100 mil/hr is easy enough. Downsides to it are the inevitable losses of your ship and way too much cargo whenever you die while learning and the increased amount of effort required compared to semi-afk ratting/mining. 
---
Also, if you want to do industry, exploration does give you materials for manufacturing certain types of things you put on ships. I am not sure how much isk you save by building the rigs yourself instead of selling them to the market, and if someone has information on that I’d honestly be interested.
---
If you challenge, you need to present evidence first. 
---
Why do you think they need the cost multiplied by 10?
---
Ok so first. LOL I am in FEDUP, in Legacy Coalition. I'm in null pretty much all the time except my lowsec Saturdays. Come to REB-KR sometime. We'll hang out and pew pew. Before that, I lived in Pure Blind and before that in Cloud Ring (you know, where you dudes dumped that Keepstar for the Summer War? That was FEDUP space. So... yeah, I've played in null, and even more to your point, I have **moved shit around** in null a lot.
---
However, all of that is immaterial because your point is not *actually how alliance-scale logistics are done*. If you are deploying to a new area, you don't take your fucking jump gates there (because it's a *new area,* which presumably you do not own a jump gate in unless you've had that Ihub for a long-ass time. Secondly, you take **jump freighters** to move shit for a deployment. I have yet to see massive traffic of people jump gating freighters throughout Immensea and Catch even with the preponderance of jump gates we have. You know why? Because any asshole can put a cloaky Loki 20 km off the Jump gate and then can grab and blap you while you're accelerating to warp to a nearby structure. Jump gates don't give tether, in case you were unaware. If you've got shit that you actually give a fuck about it arriving, you take it in a JF, not via jump gates (unless you are Goons moving en masse through vast pockets of your own space, I guess).
---
Secondly, do you honestly expect that any other entity will be able to push Goons in its current form out of Delve? Yeah, I pulled the year 2010 out of my ass, but still, there have been a LOT of changes since 2010 that make groups even more firmly sedentary, including things like, oh, idk, Fozzie Sov, Planetary Interaction, Incursions, jump fatigue, and a whole bunch of other core features. Maybe sometime in the next 3-4 years, CCP will introduce more radical changes that will destabilize Delve and the massive GoonFleet there, but I frankly doubt it strongly.
---
As for new players, it seems that you did not even read the OP, as the main focus of it is making EVE more attractive for new players as opposed to established players. As for what they are supposed to do, I will suggest that they do what FEDUP dudes had to do twice in quick succession: Whatever you really wanted, you talked to a friend who had a carrier and got them to ship it to the new home. Everything else you repackage and ship with JFs to their new home or to a trade hub to sell off, gated to wherever you wanted it, or just took it out to die in a fleet (or insurance fraud). Again, please remember that ***Jump freighters exist*** and can be used to move items in large quantities.
---
And tell me, good sir, do you think that "forcing people to move all of their everything every few months" is vastly inferior to "just spin around this same rock in this same system in a VNI for the next 6 years until you have enough money to buy a super"? That's not exactly gripping content for a new player to involve themselves in. Forcing people to move would force deployments. There would be more move operations, more chances for ***actual content*** as people try to move stuff, get caught, or organize defense fleets for people attacking their transport ships. The whole point of this post is to get people undocked, taking risks, getting shot at, doing more shooting! That's the fun that the moving accomplishes, as opposed to the steady stagnation of mining the same ice belt day after day under a constant super umbrella.
---
20 km is 12.43 miles

I don't know. There were so many proposals (from with in CCP, and also from us) about rebalances, and not all of them used sound economic arguments. As mentioned elsewhere, a good idea rarely makes it on merit alone within CCP, it needs the right backers with the right influence.
---
Them and Pandemic Horde are probably the two most obvious answers. Very large, very active nullsec alliances that will put you in the middle of a war. PH probably has more stuff to do but Brave has better SRP when you lose a ship on a fleet and their space will be a bit safer to live in, but PH will have more pvp in their backyard. 
---
Signal Cartel is good but they’re a bit different, since they don’t pvp at all and focus on helping out lost explorers and mapping Thera, so they might not be a good fit for you. 
---
E-Uni is probably good but their application process is extremely complicated so unless you are willing to wait a week or two to get in, compared to the sub 24 hours for PH,  sub 48 hours for Brave, and a few days for Signal, I wouldn’t bother applying.
---
Well because u prob. Have more members aswell , so wow totally proud on u 💪🏻

Winter is coming and Asian players are coming in as white walkers to invade, with the chinese as vanguards, and the koreans following from behind as cavalry supported by Pearl Abbys.

This month end invasion by the triglavian collective is an euphemism for an actual player invasion concocted by Pearly Abby’s to attract more Korean players into the game.

Its not ethnic hatred either. The event isnt being pointed out to mock chinese for being chinese. Its being pointed out becuase chinese pretend it didnt happen to the point of censoring the internet to exclude it or dissconnect people there that see it on thier connection. Its not different than the shit you people throw at americans for being fat or voting trump in ect just for chinese it was a serious inccident that they pretend didnt happen.

I specialize in making garments for licenses such as disney/marvel/nfl/college teams and have done a lot of work with major retailers throughout the U.S. From start to finish, fabric, cutting, sewing, printing, fulfillment.
---
I reached out to CCP on many occasions to see if there was someway I could help them get some really cool garments for the alliances in eve and even help connect them with a fulfillment center here in the united states. I never heard from them, so I messaged Brisc who was very supportive and told me he would pass it up chain. But unfortunately I never heard from anyone.

Here is a link to some minor things I have done.

Cool thanks! Ive tried that and I find I'm unable to fully scan ones in wormholes, anything lvl 4+ I can't scan, are the lower level ones supposed to show up in null?
---
Possibly? I was on for a few hours earlier fighting some guys from Volta. Gotta learn to pvp somehow 😁
---
so sorry, but it seems like you're implying SV wasn't deployed to npc geminate for like 5 months with no real effect. you wouldn't intentionally say something that blatantly false, would you?
---
yes, a majority of the Relic sites in wh are dangerous...  
---
 if you were going to go about doing this, don't focus on the WH ones, just check them as you pass by, looking for WH's that lead to Null.
---
It was intentional.  I heard they were made to hold more than they take up in order to encourage their use.  Something about having items in the containers took load off their database server or something.
---
Sure, but you cannot expect people who have just arrived somewhere to speak Icelandic fluently. We have 16 nationalities at my project office, and people newly arrived are not expected to be fluent in the local language. People there for a 2 year rotation are also not expected to learn the language beyond basics.
---
Sure, combat carriers work great against Muninns :thinking:
---
I think I want to do PVP oriented stuff, so do you think it would be better that I join the horde?
---
NoVac has the hottest dudes and makes the best graphs.
---
Was sure it was a final timer since it had a repair timer but will fix (gotta admit, was a very hectic fight)
---
You werent in the domi were you?

Nope, lost a jag and a couple cormorants. Still in the welp it all and learn by dieing phase of Eve lol

I’d look into tier 3 abyssal sites, Passive tank Gila is easy mode for them.
---
The isk isnt crazy but it’s steady income.and you can get some nice drops of your rng rolls good.
---
Rainbow lasers everywhere

red, red, red, and more red. The sansha's line gets a ton of bonus from abyssal prop mods and is one of the most "worth it" investments in abyssal mods.
---
I know the feeling, I left when they killed solo dropping supers :(.
---
Also please see my disclaimer in the preface
---
&gt; I do not necessarily claim that any of these are *good* ideas, but they are definitely *interesting* ideas to consider and discuss and are based off personal pet peeves I have had while playing EVE over the past few months. 
---
Would introducing this change be a PITA for established players? Fuck yes! Would it change things up a bit and force them to actually leave their home system? Probably!
---
&gt;I'm in Legacy Coalition...
---
So you're a blue who doesn't understand why people live in null? Protip: It's not *just* about the money...
---
&gt;Blar blar you don't use jump gates to move blar blar alliance level logistics
---
Correct, but you missed the point I was making: that *Jump Gates are an investment and one reason to hold space*.
---
&gt;Do you honestly expect that any other entity will be able to push Goons in its current form out of Delve?
---
No, because nobody has the funds or willpower to try, and the Imperium is in far better shape in Delve than it ever was in Dek.
---
&gt;Ask friends who have carriers or JFs to move your shit for you.
---
How many times do you think the average carrier or JF pilot wants to be a pack mule?
---
&gt;Moving every few months inferior to orbiting rocks
---
Both suck. Moving sucks a lot and is a shitload of effort; orbiting rocks is boring and requires little effort. Also, PI and Incursions existed prior to 2010.
---
&gt;Forcing deployments
---
Do you honestly expect players, new and old alike, to not burn the fuck out and quit EVE after their sixth move in as many years? Do you honestly expect nullsec to not become more of a wasteland should it be made into space-Ouroboros? Do you honestly expect that this change would accomplish nothing more than making nullsec either worthless, or only occupied in waves as regions "recharge"? Do you honestly expect new players to have an *easier* time moving all of their shit than old players?
---
not ustz, didn't stay up for this, but i can tell you with near complete certainty - kopo didn't form to fight you or help cone, he formed to try and tackle your titans. once you safed those up, why bother?

and why bother spinning so hard?
---
&gt;so sorry, but it seems like you're implying SV wasn't deployed to npc geminate for like 5 months with no real effect. you wouldn't intentionally say something that blatantly false, would you?
---
Uhh what? Clearly you cannot be this retarded, and you are just pretending? SV has been in Venal, and just arrived in Uemon last week. Idk where this NPC Geminate stuff comes from.
---
Good or not, ideas ought to be thought through and their potential impact considered, especially when said ideas are proposed to "improve the new player experience" without considering Malcanis' Law.

OK that pic with snuff is hilarious hahaha
---
Dude, u already habe pay an entry fee with plex....
---
Well to make distance matter between groups and make smaller groups more viable.
---
Well, everyone has his own opinion. I was just trying to explain why many Chinese players get angry when others keep talking about that - because many of us do think "The event is being pointed out to mock Chinese for being Chinese." If you are not one of those who are making fun of the event then that's great and I respect you.
---
However, in my personal opinion, the things are a little different than the  German holocaust - the German thing is about non-Jewish killing Jewish, but Tiananmen event is about Chinese killing Chinese. Most Chinese you met in-game are more like victims and not victimizers. If you really think we don't know the truth of the history, being brainwashed or so, you need to really sit down and have more peaceful talks with us, and tell us what you know about that event which we do not know, instead of simply repeating the word "Tiananmen" again and again, which won't do any good for either us or you.

I finally managed to put together a ratting vni today that cost me about 85 mill and I lost it to two gankers after only running three den sites with it. I dealt with that by letting out a tired sigh, and this guy is over here losing his mind over a freakin rifter lol.

That's my point. It feels like Hilmar got war decced, raged, demanded a redesign so he wouldn't get ganked again. If it were just because the mechanic was bad, you would hope they would have listened to player feedback before now.

This needs to be top of the sub Reddit. More need to see this

Though it’s very unlikely cap will do anything about it.

I just recently got back to playing (about a week ago actually) and i just stick alone running PvE missions. Like everything i used to do can’t be feasibly enjoyed anymore because of many of the things you listed. Low sec was on point. Like I’m kinda glad i only resubbed for a month, because honestly, if nothing intrigues me by then. There’s no point in playing. It’s not the style that it used to be for me back when i last played in 2013 and then Real life took me away for a few years. 
---
Flash forward to now, what the hell happened to Eve in 5-6 years! What all happened!

yes by cutting intermediaries and taking your ore to finished items you will make more profits, also joining a corp will give you access to good refining and structure bonuses.

Eve makes patch notes and dev blogs.  They also have key notes from fanfest/Vegas on YouTube.  Start there; not Reddit
---
As a result a lot of small gang groups moved to wormholes, where you could have a Fort or a Keep to call home and still be able to defend it. Until the capital changes killed off that play style too. Now if you can't bring capitals you can't do shit in null, so you're forced back into sov holding with all of the problems that brings.
---
It's a shame, because after being part of EVE off and on since 2003 small gang was the only thing still keeping me interested.
---
Thanks for the AMA Jester, best of luck in the future!

---
I like the guardian vexor casually being listed there like its a ship you'll actually see.
---
There's already "speed vs time" graph which starts at 0. So you can find out how much speed you will have at 10th second with mwd and cloak, then you can deactivate them and see if you hit 75%.
---
I am unsure how you can make it more convenient. If you think there are ways to do that, poke me on discord.

Imagine being this dumb and posting on every thread like you actually know what is going on in New Eden lol.

Protip: say "it's not just about the money" to all those dudes in Delve. It's not called an "Immensea-hour," buddy.
---
Jump gates are indeed a reason to hold space... and during the periods where people live there, they are very useful. Jump gates have only existed for like 6 months and you're freaking out about the prospect that you may need to move them once every year or two? Ok bud.
---
Right, so my original point stands: that firmly-rooted groups are stationary, unremovable, and not sources of content but rather content-suppressors, as they can pretty much "lock down" their space or [drop multiple supers on anyone who even gates into the region](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76666985/).
---
The average carrier or JF pilot is willing to be a pack mule as long as you pay them well and don't give them an impossible route.
---
Yes, orbiting rocks requires little effort and also generates zero content. Moving requires effort (perish the thought, I know. Deep-rooted Goon krabs hate effort), but also generates content. I'm sorry that I'm gonna fall on the side of "more content" repeatedly.
---
Incursions were added in 2010 in the aptly named "Incursion" expansion. Planetary interaction was also added in May 2010 in the Tyranis expansion. So, no, they did not exist prior to 2010.
---
Yes, I expect players to burn out after six years, but it's sure as fuck better than burning out after 6 weeks because every time they go to shoot someone, a cyno gets lit and three titans drop on them.
---
Also, newer players tend to have less stuff, and less valuable stuff, so... yes, I expect they will have an easier time moving, provided their alliance has actually organized logistics.
---
I don’t understand people’s shock that the ceo doesn’t play the game. I would rather have a ceo that does leadership and financial stability leaving execution and design to the people he hired to do that role. The CEO role is about enabling... 
---
This is a bit like complaining that the ceo of subway doesn’t make sandwiches.
---
I made 115mil off off hacking one can in a relic site recently.  Go exploring !
---
That's exactly what I mean: cap sim (the thing which calculates cap time and stability) already handles that. I just need to find a way to get intermediate results from within it, instead of final results (cap time/stability) it provides now.
---
I have no problem with elo

I do wonder what the cost was for him to switch sides

He used to make daily Reddit posts about delve rorq botters, today he's part of and defends one of the largest bot empires in the game

Maybe it's just a can't beat them then join them situation
---
Didnt know there was a magazine of Eve online.   Where can i get them ?
---
Honestly, it was [today's top thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bo4zed/i_was_on_eves_csm8_i_was_spacefamous_for_a_long/)'s (ex-CSM AMA) bemoaning how his style of play (and small- to mid-sized groups in general) had entirely died out that inspired me to throw this monster together.
---
But yeah, I don't think I can get +850 votes and two golds with this. :-P

The meta has shifted a lot towards domis already. Counting insurance they are cheaper than vni for aame effectice ticks.

I re subbed a week ago (from not playing since middle of 2013, irl issues) and i hardly recognize this game anymore.

---
750k bonuses?
---
Botters can also use other weapon platforms with no problem. It might take a few days, but then they swarm out in, idk, caracals or what else is adaptable across the board. 
---
It might hurt them a little, sure, but it won't stop botting for long.
---
I doubt it.
---
CCP's done a great job of catering to the carebear type of players that they out-number those who care about "content" at this point. More people are interested in seeing numbers in their assets and wallets climb up each day than they do about shooting each other and blowing up ships.
---
Add that on top of all the issues when it comes to trying to start a fight (1) cancerous sov warfare mechanics with triple jammers per system and timezone tanking, (2) proliferation of capitals and supercapitals up the wazoo, (3) no actual active way to attack a system's ADMs, which results in a resort to cloaky campers to literally _wait_ for the ADMs to slowly drop via natural decay, (4) etc. It's more than convenient for people to just lean back and krab day-in and day-out.
---
that's some quality artwork right there
---
The CCPs report showed bans over long period of time. Ofc it may not show what is happening in Branch, because its a fairly recent occurrence.
---
ccp blanket refused to include a recording function or a delay into the twitch integration, not to mention the fact that it was 4:3 aspect locked. it was unusable from the start, there's really no downplaying how much of a dumpster fire that whole thing was top to bottom
---
laying any blame at the feet of the players ignores the fact that ccp's effort was so half-assed it barely registered as involving any effort at all, just a shameless attempt to get more people to promote their game 'virally' on twitch by streaming it

There was. I don't think its available anymore. I bought them off the Eve online Store about 8 years ago or so.
---
I saw the same thing in Querious 3 days ago, a pocket i used to visit for exploration sites was filled with many players but after the ban in 1 day it was totaly empty then it was filled with 1 day characters, will see if CCP does anything about that....
---
walking in stations wasn't nearly as buggy as a lot of other features ccp has released half-cocked
---
people stopped using it because of two main reasons; 1, its performance impact was giant and it offered less functionality than the regular 'ship hangar,', and 2, most people who play eve don't expect or want it to be space barbies and didn't give a shit what their space barbie looked like
---
it was actually optional to create a new character model for your t00nies for a long time after the new character creator was implemented, if you didn't your portrait would just be a vague silhouette with a question mark

I guess it depends on what you think "effect" means. When I see a whole region that has lost it Ihubs I see an effect.
---
Know how 16% of all bot bans were NCPL related and only 5% were related the the imperium? Something something something about throwing rocks in glass houses.

You mean the coalition members we have, man who knew that a member of your coalition would be willing to show up and fight in your support.

Init even tried deploying a corp in Venal to disrupt BL.../Horde guristas burners

I've been running five accts burning the past three hours LUL

Spodumain, a higher-end ore type that is very common in nullsec areas
---
Its more like complaining the ceo of subway doesn't *eat* sandwiches.
---
It has never not been ccp's job. That's not narrative, that's a basic fucking fact.
---
yeah its not like there's any other region in the game or anything right?
---
I found AT inspirational. It is some of the AT and Rooks &amp; Kings that I admire most, Provi after that.
---
It is when the small can work so well, that is amazing. 
---
One of the greatest moments for me, was a fleet of about 30, I was logi leader and we were holding onto a titan, a super carrier (knocked another super into a POS) and keeping a cyno-inhib alive until a massive kitchen sink rage ping fleet by Core could come help and die en masse just to beat them.
---
I think quite a few people underestimated Vysh because Jintaan and Core had more of the spotlight.
---
If you don't like the game stop playing it and/or go make a better one. Otherwise you're just the old fat guy on the boundary line of a football game telling the elite athletes how to do their job better.
---
Painting yourselves as the heroes, while immediately tearing up a deal the minute Panfam was busy. We get it, Unspoken wants to remain relevant and what better way than to get NCdot to show up.
---
I would avoid missions as others have said they are old.  Abyssal PVE content is great solo and small group play (think dungeons in a small party).
---
Abyssals also came out only a year ago and the newest content in Eve is based on the Triglavians so you’ll be playing all the latest content.
---
That's fine when the CEO leaves the directional decisions up to competent people. When an out of touch CEO tries to direct design decisions, we have a problem.
---
One of the most glaring issues that really caught my attention about the entire post was that CCP employees have zero experience in leadership of large alliances. If this hasn't changed, and I doubt it has, they really need to resolve this problem asap.
---
Options:
---
1) CCP Dev "drive along" for a few months/year. Known dev silently watching with unfettered access to the goings on of an alliance at every level of leadership, roundtables based on their observations to dive deeper into found issues/challenges (including relevant other CCP Devs who can impact a change or have expressed an interest, and fireside chats designed for transparency with the alliance at large. Could potentially hiatus the CSM for one year and do this instead, with each alliance getting delegation slots for a virtual meetup for data collation results, additional Q&amp;A, and roadmaps with options. Make the criterea 2000+ members and non-rental alliance. IMPORTANT: Repeat the process the following year for small alliances (&lt;2000, focus on 500-1000 range or whatever gets a good sampling)
---
2) CCP needs to start their own bigass alliance with ccp devs at the helm and just don't tell people they are ccp devs.
---
Personally I like the first option.
---
Why panfam always have to link together 2-3 different fights until they find a battle report they like enough to post while ignoring all the other? There was a fight on the gate that served the purpose of making you miss the fortizar timer which saved the station.  Then NCdocked proceeded to run away with their eagle fleet and leave the hordie caps to die because they only care about their kill board.
---
four sigs have been deployed in the geminate area for months
---
do keep up goon, i know listening to sotg tends to rot brains, but i didn't know it was this bad
---
Man your coalition is definitely the few against the many.
---
I lived in a WH for over a year, I still have D-scan PTSD and my finger  spasms at the thought. ;)

So, okay, "... and WHs are too fragmented into small grouper groups than Null by their very design."

It is not a different fight it's fight for lxq ihub.

You mean except for the fact that unlike Goons we actually treat our allies pretty well. When was the last time I heard anything good from Goons about INIT, Bastion or TNT.

Good shit fellas. You got us this time, but we'll be back around ;)

That AT X fight will always be my favourite one ever and Rote Kapelle carved history that day.

if I remember right evening the lore the dust bunnies going rogue had a connection to the number

Make those rats instead spawn in High Sec where mining activity is highest :D

Already replaced tho B)

but before that, they were deployed to geminate with no effect

Resource depletion will not work in EVE the way you imagine.
---
You should seriously sit back and ask yourself "What would FEDUP do if this mechanic was put into place? What about GSF? PanFam?" Don't pie in the sky it and assume it would Just Work. Actually think about the decisions and motivations of alliance leadership, to the best of your knowledge.
---
You know what would happen for GSF? Our brain trust would math out the minimum footprint that GSF needs to be self-sustainable. With Fozziesov, this was "Delve". Then, depending on the actions of other groups - does Legacy cede some of the space they don't need? Do they fuck the diplo pooch and give us casus belli for an invasion? Do we invade and claim Cloud Ring so we have that footprint?
---
Then, once we have the space we need to be self-sustaining, conquest stops. We set up crop rotation of our space as needed and go back to infrastructure projects and krabbing.
---
In the end, all that resource depletion accomplishes is expanding the footprint of GSF, and reducing the space in which smaller groups can live.
---
Makes a change :)
---
Dat's my streaming face. Twitch said I had to take my streaming schedule seriously
---
consider it all one fight if you want, but we were fighting over a hub AND a station timer, the caps were a target of opportunity after the station timer ran out and NC warped in, fed their logi wing and then ran away and left the hordlings to die in a fire.
---
Oh well. I'm already demotivated about this game, I guess it's for the best.
---
Do you think EVE affected your way of thinking compared to your peers and class mates of the time and if so, in what ways?
---
You have entire coalitions dedicated to defending botters nowadays they are going nowhere.
---
That cloaky loki is a totally nob. Boring and stale gameplay summed up. He's a total pussy.
---
several sigs have been deployed and attacking Kalevala, the Spire, Malpais and Geminate for months, try to keep up little panfamling. Also the SOTG hasn't come out yet, your intel team is falling behind.
---
Are you reading the same thread i am?
---
This is really good.
---
"Hey guys, let's kitchen sink against a famed AT corp!"
---
No.   It's reddit.  Should I?
---
Oh, I don't think it would "work" in the sense that it would create a better overall environment, but it would stimulate content where previously there was none. Even in your "worst-case" scenario, goons recalculate and have to do a forced expansion. Other groups need to do likewise. You know what that means? **content.** Some groups will try to do similar things and may over-expand without the resources or pilots to back up the expansion continuously, or smaller groups may band together to form a new coalition. All of these things are *interesting, fun, and the shit that most people care about in EVE.* These activities would be especially stimulating for new players, who could see the effect of large expansionary wars and join in one side or the other; it would certainly be of more interest to more of them than watching the super-cool mining laser FX on their retriever on some money-moon in Delve.
---
On top of that, CCP should *want* this sort of content stimulation because it increases the chance of another B-R or UALX that could make the news and spread the game's popularity. "Neckbeard running 24 rorquals simultaneously harvests $14 worth of space-mineral" is not exactly as stimulating of a headline, methinks.
---
I'll sell you my recording of fleet (with coms) for 5b ISK :)
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Thats called a grappler
---
Give them a velocity penalty so if VNIs fit them they die to the rats. Velocity doesn't matter for travelling either.
---
Fit more points. Maybe use a Maulus navy issue.
---
I'd say maybe pour them in lowsec actually since lowsec really need some care ... hmm...
---
We love that circumstance too
---
I believe that asteroid *belts* always respawn their asteroids of the same type in the same location. I remember when I was living in hisec/lowsec, I just bookmarked the best rock on the field and mined that first every day, same spot. Perhaps null belts work differently? If so, let me know
---
Asteroid *anomalies* despawn and respawn in different spots, I know. I think it was these to which you were referring?
---
I honestly do not think the standing system would be able to handle the complexity you are describing. It would also be virtually the same as forcing any corp whose members ever travel through lowsec to join some sort of Factional Warfare-light, where they have to pick a side in a conflict they are not actually involved in. That seems like a bit much to me.
---
Not light blue it ain't
---
I agree and support everything you wrote. I joined FW recently because i was bored, i went in fw after 48h wait (wtf) and done a plex. took me 25 min wait (including npc pause), killed the plex, gained 12k lp and done 0.3% of the system contest. Left FW the next minute!
---
So, did you completely take over development from ol' Blitzmann? If so, props for the great updates.
---
The ESS is rarely used and to be perfectly honest is fantastic small gang content when it is used. 
---
I could write a long post about it, but bar wierd tricks that let people anchor them near fortizars they're a fantastic tool for helping generate more content.
---
I forgot about that’s whole saga, Erotica can go to hell
---
No. Eve playerbase is actually in with Eve's decline.
---
- People yell krabbing and empire building interests too loud. Remember 1% of 1% incident? It was just a fighter nerf. Carriers received insane buffs with the fighter transition. This caused overfarming. CCP responses in classic knee jerk approach by nerfing fighters. There was a huge outcry. It turned out fighters are OP for many purposes and needed nerfing anyway. Now CCP is extremely careful about nerfing capitals.
---
- Overargued null mega empire interests resulted in other playstyles declining and disappearing, just like Jestertrek said. It's not just CCP.
---
- People treat CSM as a popularity contest. We bloc vote. We elect nullsec FC #26 by selling him SP farm votes. Then these people just occupy a seat by having nothing to contribute. Then we are super proud how we got 6 people from the same coalition elect. Actually it's harmful for the game to have the focus group that non-diverse. Idk what's even so hard about voting based on unique user instead of per character.
---
There are two kinds of reasons why someone plays Eve. The first is the unique stories, depth, experience, "shakes" this game offers. The second is asset acquisition and growth, people playing for the "next epic item" like any other MMO. These assets can be ships, structures, accounts. But they are also empires, alliances, coalitions. These too are "vanity items" for their leaders. There used to be a balance between these two groups of people. It's now disrupted. This game's health and quality is basically hostage to people who play for asset acquisition now. Most people at the other side already left.
---
Yep this is sad. I love from time to time doing something different and not so much engaging.        
---
Run some 6/10 or mission or even some anomaly.        
---
Most of this is not profitable in terms what i can make during this time "if i just login super and start to rat".
---
NC lost a keepstar, a sotiyo with komodo in build died and horde had to pull back from branch to defend. Not saying it was just SV, but it all happened during the deployment, so there was abit of an effect.
---
It's true for a lonely explorer.  
---
However, I think Omega and cloak are mandatory to join a WH corp, even for the newbros friendly ones.
---
lol....
---
Sit down and do the math. How much exactly are they mining?
---
Hey buddy - factions are mostly a cosmetic choice. You start of with slightly different skills as well, but it's only a few hours training to make up the difference if you want to fly the other faction's ships, so just pick whatever you like. 
---
As for corps, the premiere 'newbie corps' are: EVE Uni, Pandemic Horde, Brave Newbies, Brand Newbros, and Karmafleet, so feel free to look those up. EVE Uni operates in all areas of space, while the other four are based in nullsec. I'd encourage you to look into lowsec corps as well, however I can't name any off the top of my head besides Aideron Robotics.
---
Well, yes and no. Yes because he is busy IRL with his new job opportunities and a child, and no because I've been maintaining pyfa long before he joined it, I've just been missing for like 2 years.
---
I was part of original team who developed pyfa, although played minor role there - Darriele and cncfanatics did like 80% of code for initial release.
---
Locking and activation of weapons etc is alots easier to detect than a set and forget vni
---
The thing that annoyed me most about dust was that they hinted at shit like that, and now we know they spent a ton of money on making it possible, and then they went exclusive on a console that was pushing end of life, I can't imagine their investors were happy about them plowing all that cash into something that could never possibly have the longevity of eve.
---
Ah, gotcha. Him and Ebag were the only two I've dealt with in the last few years but that's understandable. Thanks for these new features though!
---
Unironically, basically 10 mins after we got people reshipped bastion fed us 4-5 rorqs in fountain.
---
One thing to bear in mind, Jester is 5 years out of date.
---
I never heard of her....
---
Lol. And you're just some faggot insulting someone over their opinions on a video game. Point?
---
Oh there is another thing, would be amazing with an analyze tool of sorts so you could find out what the exact x value for a specific y value is and vice versa
---
Thanks. Im sitting at the character select screen chatting with my friends about it now. Trying to figure out if capitol ships are even possible for us. 
---
Good info.
---
&gt; new instructions came down to just remove more minor stuff and the features that wouldn't actually be in Dominion
---
This is actually pretty sane, given how much features in eve development change or get scrapped, even before dominion I couldn't see them wanting things they hadn't even announced in a trailer for an expansion that wouldn't even feature them. Honestly it's kind of weird that it even got to that point and I can see why upper management might get a little pissed when shown it.
---
Wait, there are still people mining in high-sec belts?
---
Just by having them use no capacitor and have selectable damage is already a huge thing in certain situations and especially in solo PVPs/Small scale PVP. Not every pvp is a 1v1 with frigates so you don't really have time to switch ammo. T2 ammo should get a bit buffed but other than that i find autocannons decent at worst.
---
P2W is the game
---
Either bring more expensive shit or bring more people(alts), cuz that will make CCP more money either way
---
Yes, thank you for posting this to reddit really.  It really will make a difference now.  You are the hero we need
---
Let's hope they are going to remove local at all
---
Honest question for you Fuzz, do you think we really need 5+ csms all representing nullsec? Or should we start pushing for a more diverse group of csm members.
---
And only due to this u reach equal losses in this battle.
---
Geminate - 0 ihubs lost
---
Kalevala - 0 ihubs lost, goon cloaky camping campaign ended in failure and krabbing has resumed
---
Malpais - 0 ihubs lost, adms still high
---
The Spire - most of the work done by lazerhawks, not sigs
---
Pretty shitty deployment I’d say
---
velocity could make them too good for traveling, making them align faster. make it an acceleration penalty.... maybe?
---
the only web that would apply at that range on an unbonused hull is going to be a high end officer web with a max roll, such as a Tobi web along with heat and links. We're talking titan money for one of those at a minimum. No-one would use one on a mach, it was probably a grappler.
---
If the krabs have won the emperor's ear and EVE is destined to turn into space farmville, where will the rest of us go?
---
Why are you rude and nasty? Do you have a superiority complex?
---
Sounds normal to me...
---
This. The next step is to use your ore to build something.  T1 ships are often a good starting point but honestly anything that you can make a profit off of works. And don’t fall into the thinking that ore you mined is “free”. You put your time into mining it and time is money.
---
Joining a corporation that has structures for ore refining and manufacturing helps a lot with increasing profit margins so that is definitely something to look into.

Yep. That worked out *swell*.
---
But it was fun, I hope for all sides ^^
---
&gt; More people are interested in seeing numbers in their assets and wallets climb up each day than they do about shooting each other and blowing up ships.
---
If the playerbase is all about grinding big numbers and fewer consequences I guess CCP is doing the right thing. I guess this was never the game for me then? Funny, I could have sworn...
---
Ah that is what you are being told, how cute.
---
They are young, man. They’ll learn, eventually. Lets just hope they will have enough brain in the future to notice it.
---
Man I'd be pretty pissed at them letting you take the fall for that, had I been in falcon's position I'd have told you not to say anything just to protect you, I wouldn't be able to live with myself otherwise. I mean if you hadn't publicized it it wouldn't have blown up like it did and certainly not onto you and Falcon couldn't have been ignorant of that fact.
---
I wouldn't worry about caps so early. Even though some people train into them within 6 months of starting the game, it took me over two years personally, and I still vastly prefer subcaps.
---
no but because ccp showed me that which corp is botting
---
and asked me to remove it.

Not going to work that way.

Dude, if you're going to spin you need to do it with something that isn't common knowledge.

Great ideas, too bad CCP will never implement them because they're too desperate to hold any remaining player they can and therefore are - hurhur - extremely risk-averse in their design.
---
&gt;CCPs way to remove Local
---
"Yeah, sorry guys, we cannot figure out how to fix this, we'll just remove it instead. sorry!"
---
And do what? CSM doesn't design the game.
---
That may explain why I saw 120 people in local despite none of them being on dscan in a system that usually has around 10. Had me real confused for a while.
---
For the glory of Poitot!
---
You have to use their methods to deal with these Chinese boter. In China, if you want to register a game account, you must have "real name verification" so that the network supervise can monitor the words and deeds in the online game. The mechanism of EVE is too naive for them. This is completely undefended. They use automated programs to create accounts in large numbers and the only restriction is how many computers he has available for cheating. You have to look at this from their point of view, these Chinese boters are not like that you thought. They are cheating for life unlike those cheating for gaming.
---
who needs local ?
---
Lxq ihub is down, strategic goal reached. U can't use unspokens jump gates for harrassing panfam/skillu renters anymore
---
This is the money shot. There's basic, fundamental code in the beta that in the wrong hands would be *guaranteed* to spawn competition.
---
Rokh my Dark Ochre
---
I like the core concept. More risk = more reward. I used it too when crabbing.
---
&gt;EVE fans tend to be older, **more mature,**
---
Hah
---
Makes sense. It's not like CCP have ever disencouranged multiboxing. The current launcher helps a bit, but the account management for more than 1 acc't is apain in the ass.
---
The best thing for you to do, is to join a corp. I was a lonely miner for 3 months, i had almost no income, no idea on how to make more money, and no friends to help me get to know eve. If you need help with anything, join TREX game chat and ask questions, we have industrial specialists in there. Also we have a corp localised in Metropolis region, with one refinery and another one on the way to be a moon miner. Come and say Hi o/ We'll answer all the questions :)
---
Not necessarily, plenty of people play multiple genres.
---
nice try StainGuy

You've been itching to do this AMA for a long time.  What's the motives?

Hilmar didn't "make" EVE. It was a guy called [Þórólfur Beck Kristjónsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Þórólfur_Beck_Kristjónsson) AKA Beck who doesn't even appear in the credits because he (was forced to) quit shortly before EVE's release.
---
You mean harassing bots? and bot accessories?
---
Not to sound ignorant; but what specifically is your playstyle?
---
Smaller alliances holding space sounds great. Wasn't there a discussion to make alliance costs cumulative the larger their space gets?
---
&gt; and then suddenly everyone stopped talking about it and we were never told why.
---
Because then everyone would ask questions like "why is the beta from 2003 better than what we have today" kek
---
When claiming stuff you maybe shut.
---
I like the idea with the damaging clouds to add a little drone management to the sites, but wonder in how far that would make ganking in anomalies even harder since you wouldn't get only rat agro but consistent damage from them. Maybe just adjust rats aggressing drones more often?
---
Welcome to reality?
---
I mean renters. If u want to find bots u can go to Period Basis, Fontain and some guys in Delve first
---
Nice lightshow and sound effect whenever i use my doomsday
---
A stabbed VNI lose a lot of dps. Cause it is low slots.
---
Less dps, less anomalies per hour, less isk per hour.
---
Even a bot wont do that right ?
---
Make them hull restricted to haulers only.?
---
I worked at CCP from 2010 to 2014 on EVE. You’re orbiting the truth, it is true that many wholesale unqualified locals who never played EVE or respected the players were given middle management production roles but the core issue that caused so much staff turnover and still persists to this day is that management at CCP whether Icelandic or otherwise is a protected class because upper management have no connection to rank and file developers. There is no mechanism to report shitty managers.
---
Developers who protested that producers and management didn’t understand the game were sanctioned by these people and routinely laid off, this has happened constantly through CCP and EVE’s last decade and the attrition is unsustainable. The reality is that few who understand EVE mechanics remain and many senior managers such as those brought in from EA have been trying to strip-mine the community rather than satisfy their hopes
---
These are the renters you are protecting. We are a force for good. Data from CCP. Good luck with your narrative.

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
CCP probably did understood that people play multiple games. Which is why they were afraid that Dust 514 on PC would cannibalize on Eve. Players can only spend their valuble time once. So it's not unthinkable that Dust 514 on PC would cause some Eve players to shift their time. Especially because they're hooked on the Eve universe and its commnunity and not so much the game itself.
---
This whole notion of Dust 514 cannabilizing Eve into oblivion is ridiculous though. If such an effect would even exist, it would likely be completely compensated by the wider audience that would get drawn into Eve's universe because of a PC FPS spin-off.
---
Presumably because they don’t know how to fix it
---
"The first time you do something you're a scientist; the second time you do something you're the engineer; the third time you do something you're just the maintenance guy. I'm a scientist - once I do something, I do something else." - Some TED guy
---
I agree, the state of the game means that the current arms race leader (Goons) dictates the high-level play style of all alliances that want to compete with them. 
---
Thankfully, some areas of lowsec are completely dead and there are a lot of empty wormholes for small groups to occupy and grow in.
---
If you fit 2 cores you can still fit 4 dda. So not really
---
you obviously know nothing about what you're talking about, it would at least take 6months just coding it and probably another 6 months to test it.
---
This
---
&gt; Is making isk something you just need to buy omega time to do properly?
---
No, you need to know more about the game, that's all. People have answered bellow with several options (NS exploration, abyssal running, etc). The real answer is find what you want to do in the game and thus where you want to live (NS / LS / WH) and then figure out a way to make isk. If your way to make isk is abyssal running, you're going to have an issue doing that in LS.

---
Well this was an interesting read. My question would be what would you recommend for those running for CSM who have never done so before?
---
That goes against the sandbox. I am all for less chicken fits, but if you really want to fit wcs, you should be allowed to. Having it have massive drawbacks though is a very good idea imho
---
Lmao 
---
Imagine having such an ego that you think we came to Venal for you...

also, we worked WITH BL a couple of times, but if you are who I recall- you are certainly a deranged little bean

There is already a high sec deal. And your prediction is?

---
\*Takes aim

 **Goons are the good guys.** 
---
\*and stay down.
---
So, ironically, the best CSM candidates are nullsec alliance leaders since CCP has everything else covered.
---
(If CSM had any input on the game design that is)
---
Indeed, pretty sure the average newbro understands the game more than most of the devs.
---
They are ninja testing proposed changes - removing local from null altogether. :D
---
if your prediction is that test declares war on the imperium you will most likely be disappointed
---
&gt; I spoke to E1 several times during the event and it amazed me how he couldn't admit that he was in the wrong
---
Because he was not "in the wrong". He didn't break any game rules. All arguments against him are entirely moral i.e. worthless. And even then they're pathetic - what amounts to a phone call cannot be called "torture" by anyone who isn't completely deranged.
---
I should be able to fit a bridge on my carrier... Or a DD in my dread then. Yes this is a sandbox but CCP has built the box and sectioned off certain things and has stated certain activities are not allowed in the sandbox so why not alter a module in such a way that makes it " useless " in a pve or pvp pocket of space.

Call me stupid but I had problems understanding that trailer as well as for who's fighting who. It's spectacular AF though.
---
tbh, I want the entire game to be reworked to the point where losing a T1 cruiser is a significant loss which will take time to replace.
---
but it's not gonna happen. dreadnoughts for everyone!
---
&gt; Was sure it was a final timer since it had a repair timer
---
do you actually know this little about citadels
---
A more diverse group would be good, yes.
---
However, the devil is always in the details of how you get it. That's the thing which people tend to skim over. Or make it entirely CCP's problem, giving them a shit ton more work to do, or just have them picking people. Both of which are pretty much no-go.
---
Voting is always an option. The CSM is representative of people who vote.
---
Everyone deserve to play Eve. Eve have a Natural selection that works well. He's probably already off.
---
Looking at his killboard, WTF the first death, if local get that salty for a 7m Rifter, what is it with that 300m Wolf.
---
Yeah I'm not seeing that happening either, unless something major changes. If another ~~world war bee~~, ehhh casino war, where the whole north and east bands together to go after the imperium I think we would be helping to defend them instead of trying to take advantage of there situation and attack them.
---
Yea. That's the real issue with Upwell structures. Losing anything short of a keepstar is meaningless, and probably isn't worth a fraction of the assets you'd have to risk protecting it.
---
 (Except perhaps the more expensively fit large industrial structures, but that's not something people spam.)
---
it was a sisi op to test some stuff out, for sience n stuff.. idk why he made a video of it
---
It's reddit though.  Ill informed commentary is compulsory.
---
When did you last looked at the skill queue ?
---
Well u pick up mic again?)
---
No thanks. I think I'd rather sit and watch paint dry than grind through all that shit.
---
Maybe it's just a bad example but it seems to me like the dev was trying to get the problem narrowed down to a reasonable scope and eliminate hyperbole.  You can't scream everything is unbalanced and expect to have a receptive audience.  It's #1 a gross exaggeration, #2 balancing EVERYTHING all at once is an unworkable scope, #3 if someone can't give you any kind of detail on a problem how can you solve it (especially if you don't understand the problem yourself).
---
Mate, you'd have had a BLAST in '07. 
---
Sadly though, you'd have also lived through the incredible letdown and loss of creative content when Dropbear left.
---
He had the most awesome ideas...one which strung me along forever was the promise that there was content in the game already there, but wouldn't be active until someone doing exploration managed to stumble across it...
---
When he left, the 'adventure' in the game was gone.
---
Now it's devolved into, well, to plagiarize the nutter from Zero Punctuation, nothing more than "bashing each other in the shins and legging it when teats turn skyward".
---
 Some people call that fun, I suppose.
---
Oh, that's true i suppose!
---
Didn't think of that tbh. 
---
Then again, there are cases of botting supers that went undetected for months.
---
IT'S TIME!
---
He can, it is meowkitten.
---
So it’s fine when you do it but no one else? Keep eating glue.
---
Why is this a separate post and not a comment on the original post?
---
No injector here, just the buddy SP
---
Aye, I don't know a lot about citadels, hence I fixed my mistake ^ ^
---
i can see why ccp seagull left

Prediction:
---
Goons will lose one rorqual or super at home for every cormorant they kill in BWF.
---
not to mention how big were the russian bloc back then . Red Alliance, White noise , Gypsie band, Solar .
---
TIL Karmafleet has more members than whole panfam
---
It's not the worst idea in the world to give friends a boost when they get into game. It's generally a good thing to let newbies not have to wait for basic skills to train for a month just to get the most basic support skills.
---
However, like everything, it gets abused.
---
Except the bounty payouts are crap.
---
Member when horde fled Pure Blind because of a few sigs. Pepperage Farm remembers.

Freedom Squad was a better name.

Shut up and go hunt bots while you can
---
It's more like the CEO of Subway has trouble describing to you how a sandwich works.

There was a slideshow presentation that covered this at a fanfest years ago. They showed that famous Hubble composite image and said something to the effect of, "It's not in the observable universe".
---
Incursions
---
"one of the largest bot empires" where do you get this from?
---
Maybe we should just agree. 
---
Its the truth. 
---
We are bad. 
---
They are winning?
---
Guess you finally got that research Rit then eh?
---
soapboxed Alpha-Account-Farms with VNIs, creating a huge ISK-Faucets (see Branch MER) from Accounts that never paid any dime to CCP, neither direct by sub nor indirect by buying PLEX.
---
I see no problem here (insert comical ali meme)
---
biomass and start over cause you clearly missed something in your eve education :)
---
Ah, another real-time update from reddit for GWCPS botters.  There are loads of others in other alliances.  Why don't you mix it up a bit?
---
hot tip: a citadel goes [repairing] after exiting reinforcement (either shield or armor), or after taking damage during its vuln period even if it hasn't been reinforced yet
---
holy fuck lmao I'm sad that this kinda got buried because I personally wasn't completely convinced that hilmar was a retard until I read this
---
The thing here is, a soapboxed Alpha-Account-Farm needs no Injectors. They take buddy SP and max the Alpha-Skills for VNI, that are totally enough for 60 Mil ISK/hr. So these farms create huge amounts of ISK, while never giving CCP any dime, neither through sub or through Plex.
---
But will you share publicly if you whether toy are banned or not?
---
I'm not sure alot of the issues you've listed are fixable.
---
Titans are now too numerious to ever handle, if you make them more difficult to build or limited (make them unique) then the current super powers will turn into eternal empires. 
---
I personally like the fact that your rewarded for improving a systems ADM's, however i believe there should be more risk/issues. For example a system with Indy should have regular NPC fleets stealing the ore (reducing the ore left for you to mine). The fleet power escalates with the value of the indy level in the system. Rat AI could also use improving, for example, if a rat dreadnaught is on grid, if it detects a player supercarrier/titan, it tries to escape. This would mirror a pvp situation, where you only really kill capitrals if they are tackled.
---
Maybe its time for CCP to consider 'Eve Online 2' built from the ground up. They may be frightened by Star Citizen, but they are two different games. The base concept is still really good.
---
Not anymore, NPC miners shoved them out. :D
---
A classic-form one. Quality programming :-)
---
Its crowded in delve, thats why stainguy has to look for alternatives I guess
---
Yeah, that's the crap part.
---
I had saved up enough ISK to finally purchase a few ads that were going to be an attack on a very special someone when I learned he was no longer in the game and they stopped EON.
---
I was so pissed off by that.
---
We’ve gone full circle back to ratting in bs lol
---
little bean, trust me and better stop now. your words won't age very well
---
found the hypocrite koolaid junky
---
From this post it looks that the main problems are 1) low number of players and 2) players organized big groups. 
---
What could do CCP to solve this?
---
you standing in front of a mirror atm, dont you?
---
&gt;and a lot of conversations being held in Icelandic around non-Icelanders even though management specifically decreed that only English would be spoken at CCP HQ
---
Happens at pretty much every tech company with majority of developers speaking language x and there being an official company language y. English speakers are especially bad at this as they seldom know other languages well and anyways assume everybody understands them.
---
Great way to make me stop playing at all. With the longer respawns it is sometimes already a great pain in the ass to find anoms to rat in. And if your idea of a great gameplay is having me wait 30-60mins between anoms, then you can farm them all, i sure as hell won't compete. 
---
What if instead CCP made other anoms worthwile, so we are not reduced to farming 2 same anomallies. I would like to have a choice, but realistically, there isn't one. 
---
And your second option would only help botters instead of normal players, because upgrading a bot to take the cloud into account is easy.
---
And spends time trying to make sandwiches more like salads.
---
No tidi
---
A titan is not only usefull for 10% tidi bugfest.... they are powerfull ship that you can use with plenty of situation if you have the balls to it.
---
nullsec (wh space if you have balls of steel)
---
whatever you do there makes much more than anything in HS/LS, be it tratting, mining or exploring
---
vni rating
---
Velocity doesn’t affect align times
---
Graph ideas:
---
* Tank vs Time: takes dps as input (with damage types) and shows how long your tank holds with current module states. Maybe allow other fits as input? Include cap running out if possible. Maybe show shield/armor/hull hp as three different lines?
---
* Orbit simulation (speed vs distance): Adjustable input only needs to be ranges of the axis, just show which speeds are possible at orbit distances based on ship agility &amp; mass.
---
Do you realize that this game is meant to be a sandbox, and have room for everyone. The "mEh I wAnT mOarr PeWpEw" is disgusting. And I'm a pvper. Let the fucking people have fun the way they fucking want
---
This is pretty common when it comes to sandbox games. You should listen to Starr Long talk about Ultima Online (one of the major inspirations for EVE). His fascination at being blindsided by what players did with the sandbox is repeated time and time again in EVE.
---
I've never been in frat treasury, no. I ran frat treasury and left because I didn't want to get mixed up in the whole botting/RMT scheme of frat.

That's basically what i said. Make it useless, yes. Please. But don't make it impossible
---
bots and everything else actualy

Read OP's name...

Are people helping because they like Slyce or because Sort is a shitty person?

Unlike the Mittani, this guy does not know what goes on in Eve.

Reading that was infuriating
---
'member that (quoting a dev-blog from memory) "Aegis sov is easily tweakable in every way imaginable and will definitely be fine-tuned"?  
---
I 'member.

That is possibly one of the dumbest things to be scared of...
---
Can’t build the sov structures needed for supers or titans in WHs. /thread
---
Greater Western Co-prosperity Sphere are Goon renters
---
Bot have been owned by multiple entities over the years, without year by year data you can't use those numbers for anything relevant.
---
exactly that - and if both MMO and FPS interest you - you wouldnt drop one for the other.
---
Of course SonicLover would be terrible.
---
You can read in last CSM8 member AMA that CCP don't want to fix stuff so no hopes for that... 
---
Srly after that AMA i lost my last will to play EVE because it's clear that there's no future for game, it's just slow cash cow
---
But you could build carriers and dreads?

there most ionfomitive rules

!remindme 2 weeks

Let's see how well this comment ages

No, you can't build a total.
---
Unless they have changed belts in the last year, what I described is how it works. If you do not pop the rock though it will replenish with the same ore. 
---
Upwell structures and low sec have very little to do with travel. Travel aka docking and services are decoupled from anchoring. If the corp that anchors the structure has to have a certain standing and the access list does not allow fac war participants of the opposing factions to use services or dock I don't understand how it doesn't handle the situation. IIRC Standings of a corporation to an empire effect nothing except in fac war.
---
Inb4 PanFam hires cymek and all CTAs will be handled with the infamous crayon doctrine ....
---
No you!

They can't. They can handle a single region under a huge umbrella. So they have lot of industrialists. Rest of eve have more PvP oriented players (in percentage)

They can't invade new Eden, no one can

Funny how that works out - Goon's are just better at keeping their word than Pamfam.
---
61 billion lost on either side is pocket change to them, really.
---
So they gimp their earning potential in order to have a chance of escaping.  Seems balanced to me.

---
Technically you could burn eden, but trying to control it as sov is impossible.
---
the technetium crisis or whatever you want to call it was not solely thanks to regional distribution: the other r32's were also heavily concentrated and there were no otec's for them. The main cause of the crisis was simply technetium's prominence in lots of highly demanded ships, mostly t2 mining vessels.
---
Only R32's are, and even then I think it's only per constellation
---
I mean for nostalgia purposes it would have been kinda cool - but not really playable.
---
But let me guess.... they took it out coz they thought we would stop playing EVE and play that 2003 beta instead - just like they thought doing DUST514 on PS3 safeguards them from us quitting Eve and playing Dust instead.
---
Still better than the second largest alliance in the game. Sadly not quite as good as an entire batphoned coalition with cap/super cap support.
---
Remove nullsec!!!!!!!!!!!!11111
---
Oh, I don't know, many of us play both.  I know I do.
---
or insurance fraud and collect bounty
---
As others have said you can't because sov is needed. Also it would make c3s the safest space ever. You could just throw alpha clone rolling bs at the connections to stop any reinforcements while haw dreads and titans blap those trying to kill your site running titans with a couple of triage support.

Removed moon mining towers as PvP-content-driver.

Theres no way yall would have samples that were sent to you that yall kept in a back room or anything like that would you? It seems a lot of people are genuinely interested in looking at these and would be a great showcase as to how far EvE has really come.

Yes you are right. And i am a filthy spod brain.

Your flair is wrong thou.

I am good at mining.

No.  Never.  Forget.

OTEC can be avoided by having the resources *move* as they become scarce.

Movement makes entities be vulnerable, the problem with OTEC was that they were entrenched. Make them move and suddenly you create a point of vulnerability and thus content.

Krab boners emerged all around the globe upon reading the scenario just being mentioned.

WTS Trashers
---
That'd also bring in a lot of flexibility. And reduce plex needed to sustain certain "usecases" of character mix.
---
Say now you have 8 characters and use 4 of them at the same time at max - welp, you need at least 4 seperate, plexed accounts. And need to train the minimum of 4 of them at the same time. Also, depending on per account character combination you may or may not be able to login - say - 2 fax alts AND 2 rorq miners at the same time - coz eg. one rorq guy shares an acc with the fax guy. Or sth sth. So if you want to do just that frequently, you'd want to split one of the accounts into 2.
---
With the proposed system you'd just need to pay for N playslots and every possible combination would be possible.
---
I mean the idear of  going tackleblapping isnt the worst but if you have a cloaky sabre or 3 gl. Also t67 is a terrible staging point, you cant reach shit from there. 
---
And whats there main home defence?
---
Just remove asset safety from nullsec.
---
Thats good for hunters as well then, much easier to catch a domi than a VNI.
---
And that is why 'leadership' matters... It is the leaders' duty to guide the devs into fixing newly implemented feature rather than chasing the new "shiny toy"...
---
You'd think it's common sense that the way to keep players engaged and not get them to quit is by fixing broken features.
---
I know I'd much rather they fixed things than gave us a Triglavian Invasion - no matter how exciting it is.
---
There were other CSM 8 members that must have equal NDA end.  Like to hear from them too
---
You sure? I recall hearing of a way.
---
&gt; And i am a filthy spod brain.
---
Please don’t insult people who enjoy PVE in this game. It’s really tiresome and makes you sound as hackneyed as some of the PL guys you ~~envy~~ hate.
---
&gt; It should say salty NC.
---
NC. doesn’t appreciate my forward-thinking views.
---
&gt; How does it feel to be beaten by Unspoken? and some goons sigs that:
---
Idk when unspoken shows up to a fight I’ll let you know, but Liberty Squad seems about as poorly run as TAPI was when they invaded Geminate.
---
Overall it’s getting increasingly boring having Goons too chickenshit to actually do anything remotely risky. Shockingly the real risk averse dudes who refuse to even form for fights besides something as literally backbreaking to your cause as the LXQ fight are all goons. I see NC undocked and getting killed and yet we kill a fort the other night and all we get is one terrible fort pilot and you guys can’t do more than dirk twenty dudes to camp the wrong fucking hate on the way home.

epic for the wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin.mp3

Both

Other game developers would give a kidney to have a player base like this.

Awesome!

This is helpful. Have an upvote. You forgot "remove asset safety". I got a more nuanced idea incoming though.

Are you ok?

like wise!

This post is about game fix ideas. Not null politics.
---
Gaaah, happy vexor is happy
---
What does a guy gotta do to get the rest? And maybe another signed poster? I doubt you remember me but you wrote me a lovely letter and got the CCP team to sign a poster and mailed them to me. This was 6 years or so ago :P
---
Ah, yes, another shit post from the world of "were not Delve so clearly Delve is a problem".  If anyone paid attention, they'd understand how much organizational management skills are required and personal time used just maintaining Delves operation, it is a thankless task for the 3% of players that do 99% of the work.

if you mine it, it is free!

Big oof. Try harder or something.
---
Greetings and apologies for coming late to the party. I have two questions regarding your experience with CCP that stem mainly from a perspective of a newcomer to eve online.
---
1) Are unique number of accounts( as in unique players) lower than alt accounts? In other words is CCP aware/happy of the current player base in terms of numbers or there are too few people playing EvE?
---
2) During your time, did you ever notice CCP talking of developing the game in a more competitive manner? I am not talking esports competitive but as in empire building competitive. EvE seems to be in a state of an oligarchy which seems to be killing a lot of its potential. Was there any plans of making empire game ambitious and exciting?
---
Apologies beforehand if theae has been asked before
---
WTS thrasher BPOs.
---
Just fix up one of those minmatar rag wrecks and enjoy.
---
It could be something that fits the new War Headquarters mechanic.
---
They provide nice bonuses and great services. Let’s have them defend them because they can only have a limited amount active. And also anchor their homes in meaningful places.
---
How is this particular character/image relevant in any way? If joining a nullsec alliance after 1 day meant you're definitely botting/injecting then I guess every single alt ever is guilty of doing that as well?
---
Well, we only know that someone rebuked the idea. It could be because of technical reasons as well.
---
They're preparing for PvP eve.
---
Star Citizen will ultimately end up as a higher fidelity, more fleshed out, denser but less wide version of Elite: Dangerous.
---
E:D isn't Eve, neither will SC. You can't even manufacture your own ships in SC even at 'full release' (whenever that is).
---
So nothing will come of the writing contest? :(
---
Sounds like the problem there is drone ratting being too passive then. Nerfing the VNI is treating the symptoms instead of the disease.
---
While I agree with many of your points the problem is that Hilmar does not understand the game. He would not understand why any of these changes would be bad or good. 
---
Horde and Karmafleet have taken over new player recruitment and keeping the game alive.  The pocket we secure them in while they learn attracts those seeking easy noob targets, providing us with dudes to blob on.  CCPs attempts to take that power back from us has failed thus far...
---
But on the flip side, would eve be here if these players did not take it upon themselves to "save new eden" and devote considerable resources into new player development.  This inevitable led to many of these players staying in said bloc or returning once some other game play aspect as been explored.  
---
 You can create all kinds of things to try and attract new players away from the blocs but the draw of dank isk and dank training and dank blobs for easy kill is hard to compete with.
---
Remove it from everywhere.
---
Or you could live in something like a C2 and build dreads/carriers in it. But that means you will have to live in a C2.

## citadels were so last year

A total recall

God I'd love an insta-warping supercap.

It takes me 8 days to finish, so I have been putting it off.

Typical wormholer having no idea how K space works.       
---
In K space there is no limitation how many ships you can bring and if you can remove access to the space. You are always in the same space and you are always vulnerable.       
---
Moment when asset safety is removed :              
---
* Big groups start to farm all small alliances going structure by structure killing them and looting all stuff that people keep in them.                
---
* None will be able to touch stuff of big groups ^(the strategic structures will be safer than ever)               
---
Don't get me wrong. I don't say that citadels are fine, but your 40 people,  1337 teenage group cannot compete with 600 t3 destroyers that are shooting your fortizar, especially with 400 titans waiting to jump in if needed.           
---
We are fucked up with the citadels, but any nerf to them will only make big blocks stronger and will create extinction level event to small alliances and corporations.
---
Role players? in my Eve? it's more likely than you think
---
Thanks for giving me a reason to fly up to VFK. I tried to kill the Sabre that killed my eyes, but got dunked by his Legion. Once I got "sent" back to Jita, I grabbed an interceptor I had in my hanger and hauled ass back. This time, no gate camps, and I got to sit at the helm of my first station. I changed the name, got bored and started my way back. Sadly it was destroyed a few hours ago.

RIP https://zkillboard.com/kill/76723074/
---
This is in PI, the more you mine a specific resource with the extractors the less that pool has, it can regenerate in the same place but most of it gets relocated to another pool on some point of the planet. 
---
Of course this is not ore mining but I would assume they have thought about doing this with minerals/goo. If this were to be done it would have to be executed perfectly in order for people to not brick there account and pants. I thought they did well with the moons as far as a one off redistribution, and seeing a moving ore...(current, for lack of a better word) would be awesome.

&gt;ers get 400k. Please show me the new players that can afford to drop several billion in injectors to "catch up". The daily alpha injector serves the purpose of giving new players an affordable boost in SP if they need it, so why have the other ones? The only "benefit" of th
---
I was a new player and i was able to afford them. Started playing in the end of 2017, my first character has 40 mil sp now. Without injectors it would have like half. 
---
You didnt give any argument as to why injectors should be removed. Only that they are expensive. Which isnt a problem whatsoever. They arent meant to be used by everyone.
---
Makes sense, the gap between newbros and vets is larger than ever due to both time and injectors, might as well give them a boost. But Malcanis' law is still a thing, of course.
---
Plus, CCP has given up on the SP system the instant when SP farms were made profitable, ie. from the start.
---
You’re saying big groups popping citadels like piñatas won’t make nullsec as dangerous as it’s supposed to be?
---
Won’t it create content? Let the nullbloks duke it out and show who’s the strongest by actually making it a risk to live out there.
---
EDIT: Forgot to answear your first question.
---
Why? Well because I don't like stopping. I could do that, of course. But I preffer just going from system to system and doing sites as fast as I can. 
---
But maybe it's not so bad when I think about it second time. It's only 1 or 2 minutes.

There's a potential 3rd option - setup consultation groups for specific things (eg structures) and invite a few people who do that as their eve play style into a restricted forum and discuss things at a high level.  Doesn't have to be NDA'd like CSM but use it as proving ground to see what the players would think of suggestions or changes and gives the player "experts" a voice into CCP that isnt drowned out by the ranty masses.  Last thing we want is another player base demanded change like Rorqual mining which was (at least in my eyes) was a colossal mistake in the form it was implemented.
---
Only main obstacle is CCP itself, management (and some devs) would need to be willing to acknowledge that players probably do understand the game and those that actively use bits DO want improvements.  CSM is a nice thing to have but its too high level looking at everything, its better to deal with small groups on specific topics.
---
remove juice concentrate drink logic
---
Most of that seems true, what are you missing? All of it is probably not true for just one alliance.
---
Closest to that may be Geminate in terms of PvP
---
Why is that bad?
---
But i already did that last year (which is why i can't fly enyo)
---
Come to wormholes, it's like mad max style.
---
There was nothing wrong with passive moon income under the POS model. It generated interesting fights for groups of all sorts of sizes, and regional control could be established through dedication and not having to wade through perfectly idealized defense timers.
---
Add passive income back. Nerf it to a fraction of what an Athanor draws, but keep the random defensive timers that POSes had; the game is richer with this content model.
---
Back to Fortnite with you pleb
---
Blame it on Microsoft!
---
The first presentations where in XBOX360 - then M$ did a U-turn and told CCP they where not allowed to connect to the CCP network. (out of my memory, several posts and from meetings/Fanfest)
---
Sony helped CCP to salvage at least a part of their investment.
---
The PS4 was on the drawing board, but there was no hardware yet.
---
Yes dev. Edited
---
What an original and much-needed post on this amazing subreddit. Thank you so much. God bless you.
---
As long as this doesn't become serenity where only arranged fights can be had let's see how it goes. Just please don't try to reproduce serenity cos that would likely be the end of this cool game :( I really love eve and I don't want to have the game become a 100% blue donut like serenity where you can't even live in peace and have some fun with solo / smallgang PvP in a wormhole
---
Null sec mining is great. PH will happy welcome any newbean. Its about 25mill a hour if you are alpha but that will change based on moon type size and if it jackpots. 
---
Honestly i do encourage people to at least buy there first month, as it take can take up to a 100 hours to earn. Or just 20 or less to keep your sub up to date.
---
It's the people that make it and break it. 
---
On one hand you have the types that are content creators and get out there and make some spaceship violence happen. On the other hand there's the turbokrab pingwarrior content denying soy-people that are just like risk averse and take the path of least resistance.
---
Sure, we can easily say CCP is killing the game, but in reality it's a good part of the playerbase that rots it from the inside, and they outnumber people involved in giving this game life, vastly.
---
It's so rare though.  I mean how many do you have in your system per year?  1?  If you're lucky (unlucky).
---
Thnx bae
---
I’m not sure if athanor defences would be enough to hold off incursion rats(?), depends what type of spawn you get I guess and this will be effected by whether you’re in high, low or null presumably.....
---
Are you sure grappler has a different icon for the party being webbed?
---
Lol I ask like ‘what the shit is a total’ 😂
---
After going through the logs I think he was trolling you lot.
---
The game is in maintenance mode.  What that means is that they are reducing what they spend on it so that it flows cash.  Can you think of a way to achieve what you're trying to achieve without it being a large development effort for them?
---
What if you just made the environment itself hostile to player concentration?  One way to do that would be to introduce NPCs that were formidable enough to cause a super-capital and structure attrition rate, and make their likelihood of attack increase as player and infrastructure density increased.
---
Imagine NPCs that spawned and laid siege to player structures and/or expensive ships that could be defeated, but not at zero cost.  You're going to lose some ships taking them down, or you're going to lose some expensive ships/structures if you ignore them.  Blobbing them wouldn't be effective, because like players, they'd counter-escalate if you tried.  Some attrition of ships and structures, including super-caps, is inevitable.  There is no "safe" space.
---
Now imagine that the likelihood of them showing up is proportional to how much player money making activity is going on in that space.  Below a certain level of activity, they might rarely show up.  Above that level you hit a zone of diminishing returns at some point where you're being constantly harassed by them and your ability to make money caps out.
---
Now extend that to over-escalating, using supers as an "I win" button.  The bigger the super blob you drop, the higher your chances that you're going to lose some of them to some titan-one-shotting Drifters or some other alien race.  Over-escalating becomes unacceptably risky.  Don't ban supers from low-sec.  Just make escalating to them in low-sec a very risky proposition relative to using them in null-sec.
---
There needs to be some counter-incentive to the bulk of the players in the game huddling together for safety.  There needs to be a counter-incentive to using super-caps as an "I win".  There needs to be a natural, background attrition rate for structures and expensive ships so that they don't simply proliferate out of control infinitely.  In an ideal world, players would provide these counter-incentives and attrition.  They're not.  The environment itself needs to become more player-hostile to restore balance.
---
What I just described would achieve much of what you described, but it would be cheaper and easier for CCP to implement, and so a lot more likely to actually happen.
---
Thank you for saying this. While people have been coming around on the idea that said types are oppressing the rest, it's been a long and slow process.
---
Trying to do stuff as a small entity is nearly impossible these days. Hopefully what you've said today helps give the momentum we need to make things happen, but I admit that based on what you've said here I have my doubts. CCP really needs to play their own game, I guess.
---
I too copypaste some completely unrelated propaganda bullshit to a thread with an objective game mechanics disucussion base ...
---
EVE stopped being EVE after 2008, what's left is just the carcass and CCP trying to pick its last rotten flesh.
---
Is it their way of "qualifying" if you know what you are talking about or is it something else?
---
You could always do something else till its gone, mining isn't the only thing you can do to earn your isk and incursions don't stay for long.
---
what bothers me the most is that i can't sell my Hel, cuz there's so many of them and are so cheap....
---
Great for CCP as well!
---
You came to the wrong thread its raining with downvotes from the bot lovers. 
---
We hit a weak spot! Downvotes incoming!
---
Take cover!!!
---
It had been fixed. 
---
This is either a regression where a bug comes back, or a new issue.
---
If I had to make a guess, I'd be thinking it's an issue with communications between the chat cluster and Eve, rather than a code issue.
---
But that's nothing more than a guess.
---
Two Init. corps headed up to Venal to fuck with Russians for a couple of weeks to get some extra content. I think maybe two people running missions got killed during the entirety time we were there, we certainly weren't there to fuck with people running burners.
---
&gt;If you want to solve problems, start by looking at what's already been removed, limited, banned or nerfed in the last few years.
---
On the contrary. Look at what was added inthe last years: citadels, skill injectors mainly. But don't forget instanced pvp, f2p, plex changes, mining events and so on
---
Why are you stalking me?
---
Bots determine balance these days?
---
&gt;Sure, we can easily say CCP is killing the game, but in reality it's a good part of the playerbase that rots it from the inside, and they outnumber people involved in giving this game life, vastly.
---
Oh yeah, I feel you on that one. The playerbase has definitely grown older and more disillusioned. We have figured out the game. But at the same time, it's CCP's task (and business) to attract new players and introduce new and interesting gameplay. And I won't deny that they are trying, with a degree of success that depends on how much you personally enjoy abyssal content.
---
All in all, I would not say that CCP is killing eve. But they have killed EVE as a game. But they have killed playstyles. Lowsec moon fights were a blast.
---
WTB Female
---
1) low sec is dead.  but so is null and a lot of hi sec.  eve needs more players.  not sure if / how that will happen, but that is the biggest difference from years past.  
---
2) small gang pvp is still there, but due to the lack of players it is harder to find.  And yes, as players get older, richer, and able to fly everything, capital proliferation happens.  If you've been playing for years, of course you can drop caps. 
---
3) rorqs as current nerfed are fine?  they are actually huge content drivers.  the panic button is a bit op, but otherwise you'd have 6B ships being alphaed off the field.  and if you gave them more tank, reddit would explode.  they have increased the supply of materials, but that isn't a huge deal.  since people don't risk their big shit anyway, we're gonna have tons of titans / supers by now.
---
4) the ball was dropped on lore.  a better narrative could? help maintain new players, but i dont' know.
---
I'm really looking on input of how to combat the actual rats that spawn, not ways to avoid the Incursion.  I wish to complete the moon mining while dealing with the NPC that spawns.  Thank you all for the suggestions.

The beams seemed a bit lackluster, I will probably replace those with pulses in the future as they don't seem to do much at the speeds/xversals I'm usually at with this ship. Also kinda want to bump up the point since that isn't a super great abyssal roll (scram is solid tho).   
---
Don't think there's much of a reason to bling the rep; does well enough already.
---
IP ban VPNs and China.
---
you can build regular cap (carrier, fax dans dreads) in any classe of WH. You need to hold the sov to build super and titan but there is no sov to hold in WH.  
---
Any cap build in a C4 and under will born and die in this hole because ther exist no hole form (or to) low classe which have enought masse to let it go trough.
---
a super abyssal web + the 7% web imp and O/H possibly ccould reach out that far tbh
---
Ofc. Snakes + double drugs + links when I'm in range. Considering the ship+fit is at least a bil (I can't remember exactly how much) definitely worth running snakes in. ;)
---
The very thought and idea of incursions always was that the regular activities are more or less suspended due to the incursion crisis... Incursion rats (even the frigates) are very powerful. 
---
If its only frigates spawning, you might (can't guarantee anything) get away with blingy high tank, high application ship + webs and optionally links and paints. Still, most likely not doable solo. But if the spawn is larger than frigates you are going to have a bad time...
---
Wow please delete your reddit and uninstall eve. 
---
I have never seen such an uninformed shitty answer.. 
---
" asset safety (taken over from a hello kitty dev i guess) "
---
Asset safety has  no effect on moon mining or the safety of it.. 
---
This is 1k times better than the old system and if you think otherwise than you clearly had/have no interaction with both systems aside from a random bash fleet.
---
Well, what rats do spawn in there? I'm an incursion runner, but not familiar with what spawns at the belts.
---
&gt;none of the following ideas are new or helpful
---
Alright, I agree that none are new, but you know, some might just help a tad. Fuck local btw.
---
Whether an idea is new speaks nothing of its value, and I know that we're too ~ ironic ~ to try hard, but sometimes you gotta shout to be heard. Remove citadels from FW space, remove FAXes from WH, nerf PANIC to 2 minutes tops. It's simple. Just do it.
---
No you got yeeted out.
---
Game breaking no. Actually many people just join an imperium pet, make money, then leave and go pvp with people with more skill.
---
Run them with your alliance?
---
In a high risk game, a significant set of players will gravitate to the turtling up gameplay. It shouldn't surprise anyone the game is the way it is. CCP could shift the balance and make PVEing in null, regardless of where, unsafe. But it won't.
---
@ number 2
---
God, how the 10 to 100 account multiboxers of EVE would rejoice at the thought of that! So much simpler!
---
Friggin yanks and their eagles and bombs
---
These are all true, though my point is you have to frame it in terms of what those have lost us. Skill injectors have removed a lot of the value of SP. Citadels have severely limited the amount of timers you can contest and thus fights you can generate, and active moon mining was the complete removal of the fundamental mechanic that almost all fleet scale low sec pvp was based on.
---
Mainly what I was getting at though is the real issues with the game have arisen in the last 3-4 years so it's a waste of time talking about things that have remained largely unchanged since 2004 as it's unlikely they're the problem.
---
As long as he doesn't run into an Outuni any properly fit local tank BS, hac or T3 (if its a regen fit even outunis are doable) should be able to deal with a random spawn.
---
Which is why I use twin Paladins when missioning, and you can T2 fit them too.
---
Which features of her roadmap have actually made it in-game?
---
Which features haven't?
---
Isn’t the whole idea of incursions that they make you come together as a group and that you can’t just continue with everyday live ?
---

They're not reverting to the old chat system because it's much more work getting it back than finding a fix for the current problems the server has.
---
cause its not impressive killing carebears thats why.  he's the one trying to act cool by killing noobs.  its wildy agreed upon lowsec pilots are the best,  He makes this video against a LS group,  10times better video.  this is like the world chess champion playing chess against a 5yearold.
---
Please learn to read &amp; comprehend, I never said that asset safety has something to do with moon mining. It just adds up to the current situation that no one wants to grind structures, as there is not a single incentive to it, just punishing boredom.
---
Also the new system is not better, as it caters the game towards players that actually do not log in, punishing the ones actually logging in. I play since 2007, lived in Sov-Null, NPC-Null &amp; Lowsec.
---
That is why I am giggling about your last sentence, that fully applies to you
---
Won't work as long as the bot can query ESI and check if that player does exist.
---
Not really. If they remade it as a single player game yes but a straight port no.
---
Beagles?
---
Oh you could make them exist easy enough. Probably not even hard. It's making sure you cant set their standings that'll be the tough cookie.
---
Exactly that... we are our downfall...
---
It's not like it's CCP's job to make sure that people have a variety of options and not only one proper way.
---
Panic could be removed if rorqs in siege were able to receive remote reps (or if the indy core cycle time was significantly reduced to say 45s). Remove panic without changing that and they basically cannot be saved from say a reasonably sized bomber gang or &lt;insert fleet type here&gt;.
---
This must be an alt from some CCP dev, or a new shitpost bot from stainguy
---
Keeps the money rolling. Ban the botter, botter just buys a new bot and SP -&gt; Profits.
---
Sorry CCP I have failed you.
---
Since you're a "newbean" yeah, you're getting none of this. Newbees used this reality, though. Just change your perspective.
---
They did make structures with 2 or 3 timers, DPS cap and asset safety though
---
They would still post their ideas though. First, because it's easier to play along instead of explaining this to people. Second, because you are still going to be someone providing insight and opinion to CCP when asked, and people would want to know what your ideas and opinions about the game are.
---
&gt;CCP devs want to work on new and interesting things. It's a bit like science: the glory is in making the original discovery. When someone makes an original discovery in science, someone else is supposed to go back and confirm the findings. It's one of the core tenets of the scientific method.
---
&gt;But doing so isn't sexy and doesn't result in grant money.
---
I think this is changing a bit as of late- certainly not R01's, but validation grants are cropping up. Or so I've heard. 
---
Ok, I'm going back to my new novel project that will probably not go anywhere, I'll have to let the strangely high percentage of non-reproducible results alone for now. 
---
:) 
---
(Good analogy though!)
---
You should definitely chceck the water you drink.
---
I sense some heavy metal poisoning from your post.
---
Not gonna lie, that looked dull as fuck.
---
Did they drop it?
---
If I miss one more day I'm boned too. Literally set an alarm on my phone to login.
---
but have you seen how many 5 year olds? 
---
I don't know i find them cool, and i think you are mission on the Tuskers pedigree.
---
And you seem a bit angry about something more. But each to their own, you do you.
---
Send em to the RANCH!
---
RIP
---
Might also be influenced by the fact that your alliance &amp; coalition leader tells people not to report friendly bots
---
yup it definitely isn't because you're a carebear, you're a valiant war hero running all those burners devaluing the LP!
---
(Goons have been running them for years too so to you would that be considered awoxing?)
---
Watch out the fat CFC be comin' to clutter up your KBs
---
Hustlan died for our sins
---
:pray:
---
I'd just shorten the panic button invulnerability to 2-3 minutes.
---
This all looks good to me tbh, especially the facwar stuff. I would strongly consider only disallowing supercapitals in empire lowsec, and change the non-FW empire lowsec space to pirate lowsec. Give those areas pirate mission agents to give them some purpose, though primarily pvp, and allow supers/titans for logistics and power projection purposes. It's largely empty space and more or less always will be - give the null guys SOME alternate options for moving their supers to invade other null guys besides "straight into enemy space".
---
I never said Snuff had blues did I?

No, they redacted it to keep working on it. Been in the cooler for another year and a half
---
\+1
---
EV:Nova
---
Almost did it. :)
---
They did make rorqs
---
If I didn't intend to stir the pot too much, I'd just shorten the panic timer to 2-3 minutes. I'd much rather go to a time before rorqs were the go-to mining ship, but that's never going to happen, is it...
---
Hi Leo

Warp in one/two npc tackle frigates at random intervals until all waves have been cleared in anoms

---
And? Just kill them.
---
So you wanna defeat bots with more bots? Take this fool to the dronelands
---
I got frustrated with kyte B.S. (not battleship) and bought a huggin with a abyssal web. Webs out to 89km heated, no boosts, no implants.  It did cost a bil for the mod though lol.
---
The good thing is that I kill guys in bling ships all the time. It takes friends, but the fits required aren't that expensive.  Most of the time we kill ships in excess of 500mil with a group of ships costing &lt;200mil.
---
Someday soon, someone is going to kill my huggin with a group of caracals or something.  I'm then going to regret using that mod.
---
Yeah, regional resources don't work, but building scarcity definitely would, especially if it got to the point where completely unused areas of space would have be considered for mining. It would make renters pointless as you'd want to rotate your crops, and it would still make a huge empire valuable if you had that many people.
---
Thin out null, and the carebears will simply move to non-sov space they can secure. The miners would probably go into wormholes and the ratters would probably move to npc null missioning.
---
Diversity. Health.
---
I figure I could only launch one salvo of torps at a time, I'm terrified of getting insta-popped if I get locked.
---
And still come up on top and glass your homes :D
---
Human nature cannot change, the game can. That's CCP's job to plan ahead of human nature, they even have a dedicated community group (CSM) for that. I'm going to blame CCP if you don't mind.
---
I'd say DREDDIT IS RECRUITING but honestly if I see more blue I'm going to vomit.
---
Just go to Stain and come fight us
---
tbf it's more like space marines
---
Bad bot, the guy just wants some help...
---
Indeed. 
---
To my knowledge, there isn't any other MMO that has such an extensive API (ESI) with so few restrictions. Add to it the data export (the SDE) which is a treasure trove, this leads to this infamous explosion of great tools for Eve Online.
---
It kind of does, though.  I've gotten people into the game through the AT in years past.
---
One thing's for damn sure; it brings in more profit than all of those fucking failed projects that CCP has pissed their money into over the last 5 years.
---
I was suppose to miss it too because of vacations. A super cool historical viking camp for 5 days. 5 days of fighting and drinking (in that order) and cool craft and meeting tons of people. Car broke down half way through the trip, and I was stuck for days at another member of troup's house.
---
No cool vacations AND no 1M SP. By one fucking day.
---
I really do like pyfa, but is it just me or is its performance much worse than that of EFT?
---
It's nothing massive, but in many places UI interactions take long enough to be just barely noticable.
---
Also it often takes 15-25 seconds to start up for me. Does anyone else have that?
---
But making ESS mandatory in systems and not possible to anchor on POS grids/in anomalies could be pretty good. Allows for ways to start fights that currently do not exist.
---
&gt; James 315's disciples told anyone that they ganked that I would handle reimbursement of their ships. It took a fucking year before the GMs put a stop to it.
---
Every time I hear that guy's name it is always linked to something nefarious and bad for the game.
---
It's really fucking irritating.
---
Yeah, whomever controls Poitot at the end of the month wins. ;-)
---
CCP did what they could for the game. Not their fault everyone is scared shitless of losing their ships
---
Domi can rat aligned
---
Yeah, you don't think that modders would easily fix that?
---
They created the problem by creating jumps bridges and ships with jump drives, and not nerfing them enough afterwards. They are completely to blame.
---
They're significantly harder to kill if you join the biggest, strongest, bluest group though, which oddly enough became considerably bigger, stronger, and bluer after rorquals became a thing.
---
No one? Observe Wrecking Machine its literally all they do.
---
All signs point to all of the things you talk about getting worse, not better.  A lot worse.
---
That would make nullsec more interesting to me, I usually always stay in W-space since there is more thrill to it
---
Eh, it's less that I was itching to do it and more that I've mentioned a lot of stuff over the last five years that I haven't been able to talk about that I wanted to (like the Dominion trailer story).
---
I also made a promise when my CSM term ended that I would release the notes for all of the Summit topics that were NDA'ed at the end of my term. That promise is now kept.
---
Was there major CSM 8 disagreement is a good question! I've been sitting here thinking about it for a few minutes and nothing huge comes to mind. CSM 8 was a really good group. We *did* disagree from time to time, particularly about where we thought CCP should be spending their resources. But it was always professional from what I can remember.
---
That’s our fault, don’t become a blue blob lol.
---
100%, add a new module that reclaims unmined moon ore so alliances have an incentive to overextend and fight over noman's land.
---
Right now sov that you can't cover with an umbrella is useless so there's very few border fights since neither groups are interested in it.
---

Hey Hurin

removing local is not the solution to all, but delaying local could deny the most pressuring abuses ... Intel Bots and PvE Bots
---
It will, until it will kill all the small groups and only players in the big blocks will be left.         
---
Sorry but this is one simple way to help CCP to kill this game.
---
Get omega, get into exploration in a Stiletto, easy money.
---
Simple fix for this is to drop all Chinese players.
---
Let's be real here: they are ruining the entire game.  Completely and thoroughly.
---
It's time for them to go.
---
or just adapt le WH escalation in NS. Ad a HIC spawn if carrier or more come in anomaly
---
As someone who was deployed to there before i second this statement
---
&gt; *comment score below threshold*
---
Serious question: What killed small gang and solo lowsec pvp? I never tried it but i hear all kinds of people say that it's "Death".
---
Why Don't all the small gang people just make a pact to go and make a death low sec region or constelation "small gang paradise"???
---
Maybe. But all 3 CCP employees who read reddit downvoted me so far. 
---
So i would not get your hopes high. :D
---
Addendum: they will claim that those losses do not matter because its already replaced/its cleaning up the fat/they didn't deploy like they should have/etc.
---
Reduced max velocity does affect the time to accelerate into warp for bigger ships though
---
Bit wrong here.        
---
People stated citadels in the current mechanics and no limitations are a mistake, same for rorquals, same for moon mining, same for entosis ceptors, same for 0% trade taxes in higsec .... waaaay to many things.             
---
Eve is one of those games
---
Many of these suggestions are actually pretty good, though there is more to add to it (citadels need a serious rework).
---
The biggest problem we face, however, is that ccp isn't going to listen until we burn their house down (see summer of rage).
---
Have you any thought toward organizing player protests?
---
CCP created mechanics that give you a strong defensive advantage, the strategic ability to turtle up and farm very easily in order to build up your force without risking it if you don't wish to. CCP are the one who catered to the "but what about the small guy" mechanics that gave massive advantage to the strongest alliances while ignoring the actual mechanics that would help creating content for small alliances (FW / LS).
---
CCP is to blame. Players will always take the path of least effort and CCP should be able to create a game avoiding issues created by that easiest path.
---
Wait how did you know that i have shit posting bot?
---
Sado-Masochism is also a thing I heard. Literally the only reason for pvp-centered players to shoot citadels is hoping for someone to find his balls and give a fight on a timer.
---
If this hope is pointless, most groups wouldn't even bother reinforcing it.
---
Well you cant be that good .. or that fast.. ;)
---
True, if your max velocity changes while aligning. 
---
I suppose you could refit to WCS while aligning to warp faster if they had this effect. Makes you think.
---
My hopes are in Dual Universe
---
shit        
---
&gt;Thread.Sleep(1337);        
---
i knew i was way to optimistic
---
Lowsec is dead, facwar died to citadels and botting, all my former galmil buddies moved to fuckin TEST.
---
Small gang is definitely getting rarer. b0rt has been busting their balls to bring it back, and we're getting out constantly but we're pretty rarely getting GOOD fights. Guys, come roam Legacy space, it's mostly good fights these days
---
I'd really like to see how much CCP's income stream changed after Citadel.
---
So are players tho

Can't wait for the speedtravel superfleet meta

As far as solo and small gang groups, I solo a lot and run small gang out of Dreddit. Every null group should have a solo / small gang group that teaches newbros.

There's a lot of different ways to find solo and small gang pvp, it really depends what else you want with it. Do you want dscan pvp in fw plexes? Do you want to scan a lot? Do you want to f1 monkey sometimes?

I doubt it very much but unless I've missed something, we have no way to know. I don't think there is currently what one could consider a long-term plan for EVE's development. At least one hasn't been communicated that I've seen.
---
It stands for special interest group. Basically sub groups within the coalition that like to do specific things ranging from very elite PVP things to very un-elite PVP things.
---
That's a bold claim, so I went and checked it. Around 2/5 (19 out of 48) of their ships have flexible damage. I only counted the ships that have a damage bonus. If you include a couple other combat ships that have no damage bonus (eg sentinel and crucifier), then the proportion is close to 50/50. Counting was done under the influence and may be unreliable.

1. We were never shown this particular metric on CSM 8. The metrics we *were* shown had a lot more to do with player and account retention and CCP's goals about how to improve that. In particular, we were shown the metrics showing the vast bulk (90-95%) of people who try EVE don't stay with EVE. Those metrics later became public in a talk that Rise did.
---
2. It was never explicitly said, "we are doing this to create large fights to create a lot of buzz" but it was definitely on the minds of a lot of people. At both of our summits, we had sessions titled "Large Battles and the Future of EVE" which kind of tells you where their heads were collectively at. Again though, those discussions were all made public and resulted in things like the Brain-in-a-Box implementation.

so im not new to eve but i have always had trouble understanding what people are talking about is there somewhere i can learn what all the eve lingo means you guys talk about acronyms and other things and i never kno what they are talking about because of me not knowing what it means i hope this makes sense
---
What you have to do is make it so that only super carriers can launch the boarding ships. That way, instead of nobody bringing a super to a fight, it encourages every side to bring the most super to a fight. Because you don't want to be the side that has zero when the other side has two oh, but you don't want to be the side that has five when other side has six.

I'd even accept a comprise of Athanors having 1 timer in the same way POS's did
---
I love how the comments are just arguing with you.
---
I appreciate that you tried
---
People always say this, bring up the feeling like it's random and you have no influence over it. Half the stuff that happens in Eve online is random that you have no influence over. You tackle a random ship and a beacon opens that drops a felita capitals on you from some Corporation you never heard of, what exactly could you have done to influence that?
---
You go to Plex your account, but Plex now costs double what you thought it did because of all these Market factors. No amount of bullets in your ship is going to change that.
---
If Dustin mechanics are meaningfully impacting Eve online, that is because dust is part of Eve online. If you want to influence it, you should be playing dust, or making Financial or military alliances with the corporations in dust. You should be treating them like Assets in the game of players playing a specific class of gameplay that is just a little bit removed from what you normally play. The same way you have to make strategic decisions around mining or Logistics or reconnaissance with any other group that does things that you don't do.
---
i like how you think i hate tuskers!?  All i've stated is try it now in lowsec to prove skill.
---
It means you lost the political game. Your alliance and Coalition leaders failed to secure meaningful contracts with the dust corporations that have the capabilities resources an interest necessary to protect your most valuable assets. A creative room at the top for more interesting political gameplay, as hinted at in the future Visions trailer.

---
Edit: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon
---
It's a good question, and it deserves a thoughtful answer.  Unfortunately, I don't have any answers; I only have observations.
---
The primary drags on organizational population in wormholes are logistics and funding, rather than the mass limit of any given wormhole, IME.  That is to say that the biggest issues are the inconsistency of access to outside markets (particularly for T2 and deadspace modules) and the fact that sites do not respawn in the same system as they were last in.  The result is that large swathes of high-class wormhole space is colonized by alts that log in a few times a week to run the sites and then log back out, which ideally would make for good targets, except, well, you have to surprise them to catch them, so it ends up feeling like a 0.5% chance to get a hit on someone.  It's also not hard to find either a completely empty system (if you want to set up shop, yourself) or a large corporation's base, but, again, it's inconsistent, and you have to hope that both sides have numbers and show ships that the other wants to engage.  Honestly, there's still a ton of space for more people to colonize wormhole space, and citadels make it a lot easier than it used to be.  It's still logistically complicated, with significant scaling to alts, and the lack of asset safety makes it *siginficantly* more winner-takes-all than the rest of EVE, where you can bring arbitrary numbers to bear but can't keep the stuff from the targets you knock over.
---
I have more thoughts, but I'm having a hard time organizing things in my head and I need to run, so I'm hoping this is helpful.
---
I know people think of it as another game, but if dust and Eve online where that interlinked, they would really be the same game at that point. They would essentially be the same universe with the same assets, just with different clients that can interact with different aspects of that game. It's like how the political leaders of Eve are playing Eve online, sometimes without ever logging in. They are metagaming the CSM, for instance, influencing things in ways that you cannot stop from your client.
---
So yeah, I don't think it's fair to call it another game. It would just make Eve online a larger game, a game with one extra dimension. You would have the computer Dimension, the real-life Dimension, and the console dimension.
---
Translation: ME HAVE POWER NOW, YOU NO THREATEN ME POWER BECAUSE ME LIKE IT. ALL THINGS THAT THREATEN MY POWER IS BAD BECAUSE I DESERVE TO HAVE NO RISK IN GAME. ZUG ZUG
---
That is very,very true.
---
They should be removed, because they don't get used by the group that was supposed to use them, and are instead used to accelerate a growing division in capital numbers. 
---
Now, I would really like to know what new player friendly activity you were doing that you made enough money to regularly drop 800+ million (at the time) into skill injectors? 
---
&gt;They arent meant to be used by everyone
---
The rationale for their introduction was to give new players a possibility of catching up. They are meant to be used by new players, which just is not happening on a scale that would justify the massive problems that being able to buy more than a years worth of training instantly brought.
---
This is so infuriating to hear. There are so many people who already multibox 10 accounts in Eve online, you were telling me they are concerned that someone won't play something while also playing Eve online?
---
There are 10,000 new players every month to try Eve online for the first time because the universe and the lower and the player interactions stories draw the name, but they leave because they don't like the game play. Oh man, I wonder if maybe they would stick around if there was a way they could interact with that universe that wasn't the Eve Online gameplay? Maybe something a little bit more fast-paced but still have long-term impact and permanence in the game? Jesus Christ.

If it were for the "elite athletes", this game would have died in 2011.

Same. I grabbed a sub for my alt few days before randomly, and I failed a few days at the start of the event. I NEED those 2M SP.
---
this ... i think injectors , rorquals , citadels. Citadels in general are good but their Reinforcement and damage caps are trashhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.. i will literally kick the guy in the nuts until he cannot reproduce for coming with the idea of having 7 days to kill a low power small upwell structures.. so that he cant give more stupid ideas. A new upcoming problem would me micro jump field generators as more and more groups are getting to realize how gay they can be. As people below state i don't think passive moon goo is a solution for  lowsec pvp either . Low sec needs something far more unique to fight for than just moon goo..same goes for npc null and eve in general needs to cut down like removing space cobalt edge , Omist which are not in reach of any npc spot for hostiles to form from . We have biggest fucking space stations here but we still cant have something to decloak afk campers.
---
remove subcaps.
---
Skill **Extractors** are the problem, but CCP needed the money to make them attractive to PA.
---
The moment the rest of the deal is fullfilled the game will go full *'Greed is Good'* and those loot boxes will need a key to open.
---
The lack of sov warfare is a huge problem. CCP saw that we had big issues with grinding so many timers that they decided to add even more timers and structures to grind.
---
Also the economy feels like runaway inflation.
---
fucking amen
---
Cool.  I just meant that I have seen posts etc advertising this moment for sometime.  So wondered if there was anything personally why you wanted to do this or purely to give some inside info .

The dominion trailer for me using  Russian and American etc voiceovers was completely wrong it sound like a Command and Conquer game it just didnt feel right. However maybe I missed it but what's the controversy about this trailer

That doesnt change the fact that their lifetime can't be longer than 8 days and is usually shorter.
---
Who are you and why do we care about your opinion?
---
Remove skill injectors, but that is the delicate balance of what is bad for the game but what is very good for creating revenue so that the game we all play can afford to keep running for years and years.

Thrasher, one must always fit in with the herd.

1) CCP can't fix local.

2) lets suggest CCP spam local with a shit ton of accounts?
---
I get the concept here, but it would be a pain to implement and probably would be solved by bots within a day or two.  plus if you are just going to throw random chat bots into local what is the point of local?  and no, i'm not suggesting remove local.  that horse is dead.
---
I actually agree with this person
---
Cap spam, mostly. Yeah, you can still do smallgang, but only till you get dropped by 10+ carriers/supers/haws. Honestly, while there are many arguments to the contrary, I'd trace this to a) cheaper caps and b) jump fatigue meaning smaller groups can achieve local capital supremacy and no one will contest them because then your fleet has hours and hours of space AIDS.

You should consider comparing Injector pricing against PLEX (for subscription/mct) one month lagged since that PLEX price is the actual input for the month of training. Also consider MCT bought directly from market versus through PLEX as the former might be cheaper (especially so during the galaxy pack sales).

simple concept here and flame me if I'm wrong but: add resource scarcity?
---
Instead of it forcing ship destruction, rather, have it it fight a war within your ship, the longer the fight goes on internally, the more damage your ship mods suffer like overheating, each ship has a defensive value, with a hold for 'defensive equipment and manpower' that buff these values. Supers being allowed to launch 2  boarding parties, 1 heavy, 1 light, carriers having 1 light. Reason I say the longer it goes on is because if theres a major war going on inside your ship, you're gonna wanna pull assets from other allies ships around you, refilling your defenses, like pulling 3200's now. Fight ends when all your mods are offline from 100% damage. Added bonus, each boarding party that lands does damage hull bypassing shield and armour. Not much, serious in a major fight, but reason enough to throw a few hull repping fax ongrid.
---
Limit this to capitals only. And maybe introduce a similar feature against citadels, to help counter the spam, successful intrusions causing major havoc, but to actually do anything make it so like 20 or 30 carriers have to show up for a hut/raitaru/athanor, and scale up from there. Something you could do is maybe at the armour timer, force the citadel to switch hands, but require it to be a looooong fight, really gotta stay on grid to defend, not just look at a structure and go "yoink" in 30min. Give these structures massive defensive bays. 
---
Now, to extend this out to the FPS side, you have stuff running constantly, games being played, but say a goon guy is playing and notices that he's actually 'defending' a PL ship, he's probably gonna intentionally throw the match. No, that wont do, so, instead, have games randomly attached to any boarding action going on, but hide which team you're attacking and defending for. Frontlines constantly shifting. At the end give the ship stats.
---
Wormholes is where you want to be.
---
Everything's fucked as of this moment
---
what caused was nothing has changed in faction warfare for more than 6 years now . It became worse when netural citadels came . Faction warfare had no impact on the eve universe what so ever. While null sec just kept on getting easier and safer . FW would bring random players to fight for a single cause because faction warfare guys were the smallest fish in the pond to hunt these guys there wud be groups like say No handlebars or did he say jump  and to hunt these guys there would be bigger groups like snuffed out , Shadow cartel etc .

Really nifty! During CSM 8, there were big piles of a few of these sitting abandoned in an out-of-the-way bookshelf, and we were told to help ourselves to whatever we might like within reason. I went through the pile and grabbed several of them (I know the EVE Fanfest 2011 is one of the ones I have).
---
Small gang and blue donuts aren't necessarily incompatible. I remember roaming through Branch and Dek back when the biggest blue donut in the game lived up there. We got plenty of fights.

&gt;Worked my butt off in game for a long time to afford multiple titans, and alt pilots to fly them all, and fax support...

The problem is that some people get more votes then others, depending on how much PLEX or real money they throw at CCP.
---
It's not something there is an easy solution for, but I think it is wrong that a skill farm has more influence then a small corp.
---
yes actually thats exactly what i needed thank you so much man :D
---
You would not *believe* the number of RemindMe notices people hit me with on May 1 just because I once mentioned that my NDA expired in May 2019. ;-)
---
Wait, why CCP didn't just disband the corporation and ban all the characters.
---
Is it fixed like the overview has been updated?
---
Generally speaking or in the game? Also, grr goons!
---
If it's anything like the last time, there will be one big fight, then NC and PL will stop showing up.  Goons will end up playing space janitor to clean up abandoned stations littering space, until NC and PL buy peace for another 6 months.
---
Everythings broke. Can't log into any characters at the moment. Saw a lot of other people having the same issue. It started with some chat and broadcast issues and looks like it is branching out to bigger issues now.

The moon mining changes were one 9f the best because it let even the newest newbro go mine in a venture for like 60m/hr.

if you think any loss they take on said tidifest is even gonna come close to actually hurting them i've got a bridge to sell ya, cause at least now those only happen if both sides want to. Measuring sucess by "isk destroyed" or whatever is quite meaningless in an eve where people/alliances in agreggate are as rich as they are.

“Limit citadels per system”
---
Why was this one bad?  When we had POS’s and outposts there was only one outpost per system, and only as many POS as there were moons.  I realize multiple structures are a necessity now as there are multiple types, but why is limiting structure deployments in some way useless?

Sorry to be late for the party but one question I have: Captain's quarters.  I've heard that there was much much more already developed and ready to be pushed out when Greed is good hit. I might be in the minority but I think that with the CCs CCP could have secured some more people to the game.  What informations do you have about CC and what are your opinions about the subject?
---
Ludus doing god's work.
---
&gt; for coming with the idea of having 7 days to kill a low power small upwell structures..
---
I see you haven't discovered the illustrious 9d 23h timer.

Also they're **MEDIUM** structures obviously.

Usually the same for me, but due to a training course ashore I'm able to catch this one! Leaving for a 6-week trip on the day the event ends :) GL out there!
---
CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK
---
That's a great suggestion except where you expect CCP to stay committed. 
---
That's the issue that won't let this become a thing, CCP cannot stay committed to doing something for the better of this game if it's active work beyond a single patch.
---
Thinking about making drugs. I have a large pool of liquid ISK to fund project. Is this worth any time?
---
Gila is still the preferred pimpmobile for basically every non-dark filament.  For darks, Cerb seems to be king of the kill.
---
Their hp is high enough that they arent going to get popped immediately like regular drones.  You just have to watch the drones and relaunch them on occasion.  And dont let them get kited too far away from your ship.
---
As to the OP, be aware of the suspect mechanics for T4/T5.  Find a nice quiet hidey hole to run those T4s in.
---
I think a lot of times even the people in the loop have no idea what's exactly being talked about
---
There were ideas in various stages of development but nothing ready to be pushed out so far as I know.
---
The biggest idea that was in an early stage of development was the capability for two EVE players to play a game of "Slay". I was also shown a very early draft of what the player common room would have looked like, but I can't remember if that was during a Summit session or just generally by a dev that was involved in it.
---
"Slay" is a game you can look up. It's a pretty common little turn-based land capture game.
---
While these are generally good ideas, just implementing them would be disastrous. Currently, the only real thing keeping goons from helidicking everyone is their own unwillingness to, as well as the sov and structure mechanics that are all shades of aids. When they suddenly have to expand, they will and nobody can stop them.
---
Just FYI kalavela lost quite a few Ihubs when goons first pushed into there.
---
You're not part of the solution. The founding corp of test is not going to leave test. They're going to try to create content, and we've been getting it. It could be better if any of the people we were fighting had any balls.
---
Would I like it if the big blue donuts broke up? Fuck yes.
---
Is there a political change someone who isn't a major alliance incumbent can make to change that? Fuck no. So I do what I can, which is run small gang roams a few times a week and take all the fights.
---
I'm not sure why _you're_ bitching.
---
Okay, let's add sand to the box:
---
Create a mechanic that allows players to hack, break into, or steal the guarded money and resources of large alliances.
---
Remember siphon units? Something like that, except it actually works.
---
Proof being their hopeful partnership with Hadean.
---
Exploration and relic scanning nets you a pretty decent profit as an early Alpha, and also introduces you to a fair few mechanics.
---
Can I have all your stuff?
---
Should make it 30 days at least so ppl have time to collect all X days of juice.
---
I'm gonna need 4 days more to get the 1m...
---
For us paying customers I would be happy if they just gave it to us.
---
Don't understand why everything have to be time gated.
---
Press F ;/
---
I sit in comms and keep tabs on discord while I'm working on game dev, pausing work now and then when something interesting is happening in Eve. Granted I'm fortunate enough to work from home, but the same thing could potentially work for a CCP Dev.
---
I agree they should give it to everybody ;)
---
stuff?
---
They should just do their own corp. The only problem I can see is some EVE players finding out which corp is is and razing all their stuff without them being able to do something about it every couple months.
---
They really need to get to experience the wastelands between "small corp with RL friends, everyone has access to everything" and "huge empire that can afford to have an IT department".
---
You don't get a feeling for the scale and issues the game throws at you *just to maintain the current state* of your organisation unless you experience it first hand.
---
Reading through the AMA most of our hopes with organisations getting any love soon left with Seagull though. I still have old applications in my corp I can't delete because the game thinks they aren't there anymore (yes I created a bug report 2 years ago)
---
I've done the WH thing in the past and I disagree. As someone who just doesn't have a ton of time these days, I can't invest in scanning chains, rolling holes, the logistics, etc. I enjoyed it a lot while I was doing it, but the time investment was higher than pretty much anything else I've done. Perhaps getting in to a large active Corp would alleviate that, but again I'm not really the huge group type.
---
I think Eve is just not made for people like me anymore.
---
Ccp says of the last 13 years frats alliance (which has existed for 1.5 years) accounts for 5% of all the bans. 
---
Let me repeat for a third time: 5% of all bans in 13 years, but only existed for 1.5 years
---
By any chance, did you manage to get those 100B isk you owe me ingame?
---
Charts with arbitrary lines though!
---
No, making drugs is almost never profitable.
---
If you were mining the gas to manufacture them yourself, I would instead recommend flying out to a WH and selling the gas there.
---
So please, educate me. From my understanding the current 'abyssal pvp' system requires ships that can clear the initial abyssal site--so we are talking multi-billion isk bling fit faction cruisers mostly--and results, often as not, in two ships incapable of breaking each other's tank. This, in turn, means that someone get's bribed to 'die' lest both multi-billion isk ships die when the abyssal timer expires. 
---
If this is incorrect, please explain to me what abyssal instance pvp is really like. If it is correct, please tell me why this is a mechanic that adds anything valuable to the game in its current state, and how it can made to actually add something valuable to the game.
---
Please, do this!
---
That was a tasty fleet. I hope they send more!
---
That would be really really cool. Bit like having a system flagship but a relic of old, unreplaceable and unique
---
Is there anyone in PL that can even hunt Titans anymore anyways, why even bother? Snuff Titans at that? It's not like to are going to catch them, and be able to actually kill them, why bother?
---
And why bother to try and spin it when the OP has been in the same system as you, and knows the ropes of said system? It's like you don't even realize we have all heard this same "response" from your camp before. Sad.

---
Wow congrats!
---
Rorquals and vni bots (and null krabbing in general) are injecting enormous amounts of isk into the economy.
---
SoV warfare is stagnating.  Capitals dont die as often or in as large a number as they used to so there arent really any large scale isk sinks to combat the steadily rising inflation.
---
The price of Plex will continue to rise as everything becomes more expensive.  We can look to serenity for an example of what TQs eventual future looks like.
---
I do not care about anything, but as long as he brings charts and graphs, i still care about his opinion more than about yours.
---
Ok On tackling a random ship and getting hot dropped you have options. 
---
You don't die straight or have no options you alone can do you have the chances off, neut out there tackle if they have any the warping or burning off. Killing the ship before the help loads grid and warping off or burning away.
---
Burning out off tackle and warping off.
---
You could look up your target to see if the hot drop a lot or run with friends.
---
You could have preplanned it and has a inhibitor down stoping the beacon.
---
On Plex you have some influence on the price. If your pay isk for it and producing demand likely small unless your a bigger Byer, or run skill farms.
---
If you're selling your creating supply. effecting the price once again at ever a small or larger effect.
---
What is wrong with having influence off the battle field, when these players are fighting on your own ship, something you should have the ability to reinforce and mange incase off broading.
---
The over all fight is gonna be settled on the fps players hands in the end. 
---
All I'm asking for is the ability to manage your own ship to give the fps players something to at least effect them while your people come to your defence.
---
I'm not asking to be able to just murder the attackers out right, just being able to manage the battlefield that is your own ship.
---
I love how all goons get downvoted, Reddit is so anti goon that you could say it’s like communists posting in a republican sub.
---
The biggest possible nerf to rorquals would be to make them require ***a lot*** input. This would also not affect smaller groups in any significant measure, as they can't afford to field a few dozen rorquals anyway.
---
Can we remove or nerf whining, though? Because thats THE REAL problem with EVE.
---
I'm sure I looted some recently....
---
It's more a function of how oppressive citadels are compared to poses
---
if citadels became dramatically easier to kill, limiting them to something like 1/planet would be completely fine
---
the problem with doing that in their current state is that it would mean there is zero possibility to drop a forward stager in somebody's space to stage blops or whatever from, without first grinding a week of timers to remove one of the extant ones the hostiles put up to keep you out
---
lol wouldnt surprise me man
---
I have an idea that I am borrowing from Mar5meca. Nerf basic human interaction please.
---
Who are liberty squad?
---
Mate if you can't find fights in the biggest blue donut in eve, perhaps try leaving the biggest blue donut in eve.
---
Talking from my experience and what I see:
---
- small gang pvp makes it hard to find engagements that aren't stupid. Either you dunk on ratters and miners, or you get blobbed. Veeery rarely do you get an actual fight (even unfair ones, but not completely stupidly retarded ones)
---
- some regions of null right now are just botting VNIs and miners with no content attached
---
- null right now feels too profitable with people too risk averse for stuff to blowup, which turns into what feels like enormous firepower that just acts as a deterrent
---
I don't know I just feel null could be more dangerous, more engaging, more cutthroat than what it is now with everyone cozying and happy to be home and just exchanging pot shots at worst.
---
I feel like I’ve read this post before, it was somewhere during Halloween or fountain war, then ccp came up with fozziesov and jump fatigue 
---
“tO rEdUcE lArGe aLLiAnCe sUpReMaCy”. Funny to see how well it worked out isn’t it?
---
well there kind of is that, if you wanna show up to somebody's moon, shoo them away, and mine it yourself
---
Eve needs more space not less. It needs to feel like space, and give more people the illusion of safety.
---
This is why I have built many rorquals. WTS rorquals btw.
---
Sp farm was so good for isk when I could buy MCT for 1B.
---
With free SP for this month, it s a free titan just for this bonus ;) i say thank you to ccp.
---
Yeah I know right? Why did goons even consider allying with them? To date any and all of his former "allies" still have nasty scars from the time Sort rammed his knife into their back. Finally, he can do it to the bad guys now.
---
replying to radakos in 2019
---
Talking to a newbro recently - he was considering joining a particular large null sec bloc - not because he felt particular allegiance to them or was attracted by that null sec gameplay - his reply was: "Honestly, mainly for the ease of isk making..." - under the protection of the nullsec bloc no doubt.
---
So yeah players do seem to just gravitate towards turtling gameplay
---
Also I think reddit does a pretty bad job at advising newbros of where to go. The default answer to a newbro thread on here that seeks for advice is: Join Horde or Join Goonswarm.
---
At least advise they go to EVE Uni - most pilots from EVE uni tend to graduate at some point down the line in a different direction than Horde of Goonswarm.
---
Well I log in to play not for redeems items.
---
My point is it is to taight time schedule.
---
Plus more ppl don't log i to play they just collect and close
---
Weird flex but okay. 
---
This is CCP we are talking about, they've proven this kind of behaviour isn't something they're capable of. They start off good, make some publicity about how they're better and a few months later whatever it was is abandoned.
---
Cuz a voting system dosent enable the largest group to electe theyir own GSM.. Right?
---
Altho It would be nice if ccp at least limited candidates from a single alliance / coalition so we wont get another GSM this round. It needs to be divers.. I dont even think this round has a Wh guy..
---
I do have some charts for the last 90 days showing the relationship with plex price in 30day lag. I'm not sure how many people are even interested? This was just a way to release some "creative juices" if you will.
---
F
---
I am me. My opinion is my own.
---
What’s the story behind this?
---
haha, I still remember this, yes &lt;3
---
Also, that would be a deterrent for regular PVEers which is a big downside.
---
Honestly, too complicated, too local-channel-centric, too easy to counter given that ESI exists.
---
Your literacy astounds me.
---
I think there's still quite a few issues that are in boxes in storage somewhere... we might break them out at some point :)
---
SV doesn’t have Kendarr anymore, it takes time to mature as an FC, whoever has take over has some reasonably sized shoes to fill.
---
&gt;dk when unspoken shows up to a fight I’ll let you know, but Liberty Squad seems about as poorly run as TAPI was when they invaded Geminate
---
You seem really angry about something. From experience this sort of anger is not actually generated by people who are as ineffective at harassing you and kicking your teeth in as you seem to want everyone to believe.
---
Typical PL posting tbh.
---
Thanks yoo!
---
This post from Jester from 3 years ago sums up rather well that the player base is actually a big part of the problem, so it becomes doubtful that we could save EVE.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3c0hi9/almost\_absurdly\_funny/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3c0hi9/almost_absurdly_funny/)
---
The only real thing that bothers me is that most of my friends have quit :(
---
wh space is really not \*that\* dangerous, it's just different. Cloakies are stronger and dscan use is required, but as a newer player staging out of HS my personal experience is that it's a lot easier to get safely back with the loot from wormholes. Pretty much all the times i died as a newbro doing explo other than a precamped site was nullsec gatecamps. I also learned to avoid HS static holes, expecially with a current connection near jita/amarr, since they have a lot higher chance of being camped.
---
But it only drives mining content. It doesn't drive wars, because all the moons everywhere are the same so having more or fewer of them doesn't scale your income - only having more people does. 
---
Old moons gave people reasons to go to war - the moon changes removed that conflict driver, and seriously hurt the game.
---
I think making weapon disruption not reduce falloff, only optimal range, would give ACs a nice niche and would also be nice from lore perspective. Also adding more damage options to t2 ammo, maybe adding 5% more falloff bonus to TEs, as well as the 10% more base falloff to ACs that was promised some years ago would put them in a good spot.
---
TBH same fam :(
---
I was having similar issues with dscan, and people in my fleet were reporting things on grid that I could not see. That said given that they weren't on any mails, they may have been high.
---
Show me on zkillboard where they hit your capital
---
Your best bet would be to get out to null and mine out there under an alliance.
---
Well, when my char grows old and tired of nullsec blobbing, i definitely plan on doing some WH shenneninans. ;)
---
If EvE is indeed still alive by then. :D
---
you aren't saying anything that nobody has ever said before. CCP just don't give a shit, and now that they're owned by a corporation that's money money-hungry than them, they aren't going to listen to anything you say.
---
Remove skill injectors, add skill acceleration based upon your subscription model instead. Three tiers of motherfuckery: Fivebux a month for people to keep alpha skillqueue speed and restrictions but access to all their omega skills. Fifteen bux a month for what you get with full omega service. Twenty bux a month for twice the omega speed. Accelerated progress is what CCP is looking for anyways, so instead of doing something that destroys the game I feel like this would be at least comparatively healthier than injectors.
---
Mining does need to be changed drastically. Rorquals should be a support ship. Bring back fleets of mining barges and exhumers that rely on an orca or a rorq for boosts. Tinier ships in larger numbers can bring more pvp enjoyment when they get attacked, but also like a VNI, only make the bigger ISK in larger numbers so it requires a higher number of pilots to be subbed into the game. Also for the love of Christ make it more active. ESO fishing is better than EVE mining.
---
CCP Games clearly favors large alliances and want them to fight over things regionally, but that isn't conducive to active play. Resource scarcity and anomaly respawn timers could help, but CCP really needs to change its attitude towards smaller groups and allowing them to prosper. Piracy must be profitable.
---
Also make Blops battleships have covops and make them cheaper to build so that we can have scary invisible battleship fleets flying around.
---
More like it hurt your bank account. Lmao
---
But people cared about killboards back in 2012, too. Hell, I was kicked out of my first null corp because I lost a domi. In a way, I feel like people care way less than they used to, what with the decline of elite pvp corps.
---
Yeah merchant navy here, same issue.. Since a year we have internet on board but not enough credit to download the updates, thats how i missed the last 500k giveaway.. Support ticket doesnt help btw :p
---
" I haven't played in a while,"
---
"how do we turn things around? "
---
who is this "we" shit?  you aren't playing.
---
1. Find a good corp (in nullsec preferably).
---
2. Listen to veterans there and plan accordingly.
---
3. Join mining fleets and enjoy worthwile mining that WILL make you good isk. 
---
We have many people mining in corp and from what i can see, it makes them pretty filthy rich. I do not like mining, so i turn VNI around a stone, so i got only moderately rich so far. Plexing is not problem in null if you have time.
---
This will maybe stop or slow down bots for a few days until bot makers have adapted. Overall it would make it a little bit easier to hunt bots in game as the bot needs to check if it's a real player or random generated but it would not solve the problem at large.
---
I'm really not a fan of skill farms for a number of reasons.
---
Whoever tripped over the hamster wheel on Mother’s Day really fucked it up royally now.
---
It doesn't help when people don't vote, because the goons will get their people elected.
---
(psst, by not voting, you make their vote stronger)
---
I had my first ship kill in Eve  We defended our sov systems last week a lot against skelleton crew. And yesterday evening i destroyed a Griffin enthosing our tcu    my first kill in Eve since i play it ( 3 years )  im mainly a miner and small time industry Guy with occasional PVP
---
citadels were a  mistake
---
Finding something you want to build, a project you can aim for. Mining in nullsec is where you want to be, plenty of big corps to join that have well protected areas but no where is 100% safe. Covetor/Hulk are the fastest but low ore hold, Retriever/Mackinaw not terrible tank with biggest ore hold and then the Procurer/Skiff, best tank, average ore hold. If you do decide to join a nullsec group a covetor/hulk is the way to go. You'll have fleet protection, boosts and hopefully a few Rorquals on grid to compress your ore. Id look into PI as well. Will fit your passive play style nicely and with bring in some extra ISK.
---
Started working on a high sec alt, grinding standings for locator agents. Dont think that is interesting at all, but it's something.
---
&gt; Hilmar specifically didn't get it at all. He didn't understand who the players were, he didn't understand what they were fighting over, and he was particularly perplexed as to why a third party would show up to disrupt a fight
---
This makes so much fucking sense and makes the last few years make so much fucking sense and im angery
---
iirc, the last time that CCP released numbers, I think the average number of accounts was 1.8 per person (this was before skill farming, so eliminate that concept)
---
for killing small gang pvp at least in 0.0 this is my take 
---
Citadels Rorqs and Injectors all played a part
---
Citadels killed small gang pvp at least in my mind. Before citadels you could roam into hostile krabbing pockets and provoke fights pretty easy. Mainly because access to docking was limited to outposts, sure there were pos's but people didnt like to log off in those all the time. People would often be traveling back and forth when they were done krabbing to these rare docking points. Before tether you could also camp a station to provoke a fight and get content that way. 
---
Rorqs also hurt small gang when rorqs got their buffs you saw a big shift from mining in barges, that was easily killable with small roaming gang, to these big capital ships that can ignore / kill your whole gang solo. There was no longer targets that were killable or ships to protect those weak barges.
---
Finally injectors pretty simple people just started injecting into carriers / supers / titans and would drop on most roaming gang inside their space. Access to these were bottle necked on char training so the ships were limited for the most part until injectors. Then you see the huge spike in their numbers compounded with the fact you can dock your supers / titan meaning you dont have a (wasted) char like you usta. 
---
All these factors sorta compound why i think small gang roaming has been eating the dick for the last few years
---
My favorite memory of you was blowing up your Gnosis outside station with CAS.  I think you blog posted about it later.
---
It's not.
---
This would help a lot, it gives a chance for people in system to get on grid, but it's not too overpowered.
---
Mining isn't as good isk as ratting per ship, even a hulk makes less per hour than a VNI mining normal ores in nullsec. Carrier makes more than an Orca. Super makes more than a Rorq. The thing with mining is its super easy to multibox (run more than one account), so instead of running 4 super-carriers which is practically impossible you can run 4 rorquals and make more isk than running 1 super-carrier (for example supers make ~360m/h and rorqs makes ~120m/h). This doesn't really makes sense imo for smaller mining ships like hulks, because multiboxing VNIs is very easy and better isk, but once you get to multiboxing rorquals then it becomes worth it over super ratting.
---
You also have to consider how much easier it is to mine, it requires way less attention and is much less mentally draining than ratting in anything but a VNI.
---
(also if you're mining in highsec you're wasting your time imo, go join a nullsec alliance like Pandemic Horde or Brave Newbies and make much better ISK whether that be thru mining or VNI ratting).
---
&gt; You seem really angry about something.
---
If you want to believe I’m angry, that’s your prerogative. 
---
&gt; From experience this sort of anger is not actually generated by people who are as ineffective at harassing you and kicking your teeth in
---
Kick my teeth in? You’re drinking way too much kool-aid dude. Nobody’s even showing up to shit up local for hull timers on fitted fortizars and you want to talk about teeth getting kicked in.
---
We are letting structures repair uncontested because we have so many offensive timers.
---
Mittens is blaring the horn about using new target-turned-pets Darkness to attack Tribute because things are going so *great* in Etherium Reach.
---
But yeah, I’m totally mad because you guys are kicking teeth in. Wow.
---
Good explanation.
---
Of all the shitstorm I would throw because of CCP action, this wouldn't be the last one.
---
If they kicked you, you're the one that profited from that. A good corp will be a learning community and will help you with fitting your dominix and understanding the engagements it's built for.
---
What's the deal with mjfg?
---
How about 1.0 systems have full local and the lower the sec status the "worse" local gets until you get to -1.0 systems which have no local?
---
I'm not sure what worse means. Maybe delayed based on sec status???
---
I’m interested, as it makes your model closer reflect reality.
---
Use a well fitted Drecavac if there are only frigates around. If there are also cruisers and battleships then get a few friends helping you. You are not supposed to deal with incursions alone.
---
That's what I've been trying to do. Encourage people to get out and pewpew and do more small gang shit. You have to start somewhere, and getting my small gang people out there is a lot more realistic than getting them to leave b0rt, b0rt to leave test, etc.
---
The thing about big sov warfare is it will always BE about asset acquisition, because you need to gear up for the Next Thing. 
---
The game's ecosystem does not need little tweaks. It needs a big shakeup.
---
Hahahahahahahahaha.
---
May this super boring stuff leads you to hunting and killing many supers.
---
I know the feeling.   
---
I went on a city break with the misses, no laptop, no nothing.
---
So much Injector Hate.  I like them.  Makes training a bit easier for me.
---
This might be useful: https://imperium.news/eve-mining/
---
Mining sucks, do other things.
---
Just replace all first words with "Rework"
---
This is a good post.   The AMA really opening my eyes to the amount of bulldozing that has been done to EvE.  Real sad rn.
---
That's basically been my complaint coming back as well. I've been trying to run more small gangs out of b0rt, been getting nerds pretty reliably. Lack of good fights is a problem. Too many big blue blocs.
---
The risk aversion has gotten completely absurd. This whole Age of Anxiety thing reflects itself in eve far too much.
---
Interesting you bring this up /u/Prodiq because the data calls you out. If what you say is true why do PIBC/Frat.T make up over 10% of the botting bans over the last 16 years in under a year's time? Feel free to explain that one. How can two alliances that have existed less than a year make up 10% of the bot bans over 16 years?
---
Find a Corp that does the scanning and logistics, then go hunt solo and in occasion hello the Corp complete objectives. I'm a Goon that preffers to be in j space and if not for pap requirements would always be in one. The 'sig' that I'm a member of is the only reason I'm still in goons because the null combat stuff is boring and pointless to me. Because goons have do many, the content coming into Delve state not friendly to the loan defender. I got sick if being counter blapped. Those invading goons space have a ton of content and those of us not big on huge fleets have to go elsewhere.
---
&gt; But it's not a fucking moral crusade.  It's not a "big deal".  It's fucking video games.
---
TBH, I wasn't even thinking of that.  I'm thinking of stuff like the year that it seemed like every single AAA game was broken on release.  I think that was a decade ago.  And for that matter, there's Penny Arcade, which is 20 years old, this year, and if you go back to the first strips... it's complaining about stuff that's broken on release and how certain celebrity devs are idiots.  (Then again, Daikatana never did end up working, so they were solidly on the money for some of it.)
---
Back when geek culture wasn't treated by some people as the primary culture war battleground, gamers were already entitled shits who thought they knew better than the devs.  That's not to say the devs were smart, but the gamers weren't smarter, and they lacked context.
---
Urg, but I like Citadels and Skill Injectors.  I only think  Citadels are a little too hard to take down and need abit of a nerf but I love the concept of them.  Skill injectors make it easier to catch up in SP and I like that alot.
---
Passive Income was cancer.
---
The crates from the special T5 Abyssal sites.. is anybody buying the materials inside them? I read at one point a Corp had an open buyback on them but can't find the info
---
Remove kebap
---
Super interesting reading, thanks for the AMA.
---
Thanks for the reply. I'm a lapsed player, but it's sad to hear that after years of working in that direction, CCP might have just abandoned it.
---
As silly as it sounds, I have quite vivid memories of browsing your blog in between lectures, it was always a good part of my day, so thanks.
---
They have definitely driven some fights and low sec content for me and my group.  Some High sec warring as well.
---
Boy we could only hope.
---
In short, it's an extremely interesting tactical option when used in small numbers.  In large numbers, it lets you fly arbitrarily-sized battleship fleets at 10km/s if you have 30 of them.
---
QFC offer stands. :)
---
meh, can´t tell investors or PA management that there are "literally 10.000 new players trying the game each month" that way.
---
I dont mind attacking structures in fleets actually, find it still fun to hang out whilest doing so.
---
A special interest group within Goonswarm that you need to apply to join. They get separately deployed to regions for pvp
---
I had to blow up the video pretty large to see it but they are indeed shooting a dread.
---
Oh my god i forgot these existed
---
Thank you,  
---
And what about your thoughts on the feature itself?  Worth the time for more immersion or just a waste of resources? 
---
I didn't liked the fact that they set the default for the hangar view and then used the metrics created by this setup to say "look, 3% of players are using it so we kill it "  haven't bothered renewing my subscription ever since.
---
Probably more important to make the PMs play at least 2 hours per day, now that you mention it.  Oh wait, it's not clear from the Jestertrek AMA that CCP *has* any PMs.  Well, then, make whoever does the PM job do that.
---
People use them as intended and other people who don't like change whine.
---
Spouses too. Require the dev's to play, and split them up among different parts of space and have them heavily watched.
---
I'd pay an easy 100b.
---
its been said numerous times, but to echo those speaking on oppressive game mechanics; Citadel/ refinery/ EC reinforcement timers and damage caps have impacted the game hard. I'm not a fan of timezone tanks as it prevents more fights then it encourages. being able to engage control towers at random times to set the RF timer to your advantage made victory feel more achievable when fighting a stronger enemy. 
---
and with the recent patches, I think it helped with the rorq problems and the ridiculous application of fighters against subcaps, so that's a plus. it may not be perfect, but deffo set in the right direction.
---
But I also think that largely the culture of Eve has changed drastically. At least in low sec, it changed from smaller roaming gangs of 5-20 and larger fleet fights of 50-100 for high priority timers. And over the last few years, its become more batphoning everyone you can over a POCO because you know the other side is doing the same. 
---
It just seems like people are so worried about being isk negative and losing assets that aren't immediately replaceable instead of having a good fight and have fun playing a game.
---
I don't agree they are too hard to take down. The x47 keeps tar went down with several full defense fleets. That isn't a problem of citadels, that is a problem with super proliferation.
---
Watching from wormhole space, where you can lose a citadel in a weekend if the attackers time their initial attack correctly, it's surreal to me that hisec structure timers have a longer duration than the minimum duration of a war, thus making it implausible to actually kill a war HQ even if the aggressor doesn't defend it.
---
Omg ccp took away my personal r64, better bad post on reddit in hopes I get it back. The new system isn't perfect but the old one was a lot worse. No one was fighting for these moons like you say they were when individuals in large groups held moons several regions out of their influence.
---
Will this actually be an eviction?
---
Apparently the PC wagon hasn’t made it to iceland yet
---
Don't you remember all the problems we had under the old model, especially with one lowsec alliance dominating all r64? 
---
I know that the elite pvp players who used to be able to monopolize all the good moons hate mining with a burning, firey passion, but you have to agree that essentially forcing players to actually do something to acquire ISK is a good thing, and also puts more power in the hands of smaller alliances?
---
I remember when feedback was actually ideas and development discussion.
---
That was a long time ago.
---
Spreading isk into more players wallets (instead of alliance/corp wallet) would in theory encourage them to be less risk averse. your argument is invalid, also you are a salty boi
---
I agree with Capri.
---
It was a pretty bullshit move by them. but what isn't bullshit by CCP. "No requirement to log in every day..." yeah, fuck you CCP.
---
Used to be filled with goon/tapi upvoters , things have changed. Feel free to elaborate on what caused this.
---
Keep up the good work, love your vids.
---
Sometimes you don't even need to shoo them away!  I've seen athanors, particularly in the NPC null regions near the borders of sov space, which were just sitting there with expensive moon rocks you could ninja mine.  It's pretty funny to pull out one of the T2 mining frigates and go to town on them.
---
Of course, then you need to spend 10M to get the ore spec, and it's not consistent enough to really be worth doing that.
---
I will be honest with you, if you enjoy mining you don't need to PLEX your account you can just stay in the venture. The gameplay is exactly the same no mater the ship.
---
These type of events are designed to get people to the login screen and hopefully past it so they do stuff in the game. Obviously doesn't work for a good chunk of people, but if just 10% of the people that would otherwise not start the game on the event days do something for an hour or two that's good enough for CCP. User count is up again which always looks good on reports, never mind that it dips down immediately once the event is over.
---
Giving everything in one big pile as they used to a few years back kinda misses the point on that.
---
I agree though, it's timed too tightly. 30 days would have been perfect without hurting the intended goal for CCP.
---
You probably already noticed this but there’s a typo for the legend for the red line. It says “Protitability” instead of “Profitability.” 
---
Funny enough I read it three times and almost thought it was some fancy economics term. Was about ready to google it until I noticed 🙄
---
That's not what the post says at all. What the post says is "Delve is so game-breakingly (and permanently) productive and well-protected that it is a content stifler, rather than a content creator." If you would like to see a more explicit and in depth series of reasons why "Delve is a problem" and why "Why don't others just set up their own Delve? They just must not be willing to put in the work!" are both predicated on false assumptions, feel free to read anything labeled with a 2 in \[this post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9xxc8s/adaptive\_anomaly\_respawns\_an\_idea\_that\_would\_fix/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9xxc8s/adaptive_anomaly_respawns_an_idea_that_would_fix/))
---
As someone who has managed alliance markets, personnel, ship stocking, newbro training, and a whole bunch of other organizational facets of an alliance, I can certainly appreciate the organization and systems that needed to be put in place to make Delve a reality. Mad respect. That being said, the game mechanics as they stand now give Goons (and other stationary mega-blocs) permanent and unsurpassable supremacy from this day until their last day. That is not conducive to the long-term survival of the game.
---
Yeah because 40k protect their own bots 🤦‍♂️
---
First one is not graph of plain stats though, it is more akin to combat sim (which should provide data for the graph). Might be doable, but cannot promise at any point.
---
Second one sounds easy to implement, but I need formula or some kind of algorithm behind it (where I provide it with set orbit range, mass, max velocity and inertia and it tells me actual orbit range and velocity). So far, I've never seen anything like this.
---
Maybe they could make Drones a 3x skill and only let it train to 4 as an alpha... do you see any dis advantage to that?
---
There are concerns about not competing with yourself like EA's Anthem and Apex Legends, though that is discounting that Anthem is bad. But as a general thing it is something to be wary of as you might end up with the same customers but having to pay twice for them.
---
However Eve and DUST are two different gameplay styles and one would act as a draw to the other as well appealing to those who like one gametype but not the other.
---
Time-gatey shenanigans to inflate login numbers is like killmail whoring for game devs. Everyone knows it's bullshit but they do it anyway.
---
The issue is the fact the alliance logistics don't bring in new haulers regularly. 
---
I'd love to do courier runs with my JF, ISK isn't the issue I've faced across several different groups.
---
It was a rather unknown game unfortunately crazy addictive. If you search youtube for Time of Defiance only 2 videos from the game show up (surprisingly, thought there were more) and one of them is mine. The other one (top one) is probably a good indication of the game if you are interested in learning about it.
---
As much as I love to see dead goons and as amusing as it is to see fleets get deleted by HAWs. It's not really something worth bragging about when its a pile of feroxes.
---
Correction: Remove downvoting
---
Its not even that its that sometimes people like playing FPS games over spaceship games.
---
"Some fights" is not really a persuasive metric to me. We had "some fights" over money moons, too - about a decade's worth of nonstop wars in lowsec, massive nullsec invasions, and everything in between, over money moons. Most of that content is gone and if what we've gotten in return is "some fights" and the blip of early-2019 hisec meatgrinder, that's just not really worth the tradeoff to me.
---
One of many insane things about citadel mechanics.
---
Propaganda like this is a great way to get all of the northern players that won't undock to fight a chance to come chest beat in public.
---
I want to fix all the reddit warriors who think they have the end-all be-all ideas about preventing botting.
---
Bots gonna bot! And regardless of what your genius solution is, if it causes more tedium to an already boring and hardly profitable activity in game, then it’s just not the right answer.
---
What’s the point of getting rid of bots if you are driving away real players too. It’s already hard for most casuals to make enough isk to keep up with this economy, no need to make it worse.
---
This is literally the same thing they said about the five regions surrounding Deklein before The Casino War.
---
I missed one of my accounts because I didn't have an authenticator on it and didn't have access to my email. 
---
Feels bad.
---
Made you post.  This was a shitpost, btw.
---
New hat for Fozzie?
---
in russia i wonder if its the other way round?
---
I'm willing to adapt, but the conflict you're talking about is distinct from an actual invasion. That's me taking a fleet or a small gang and dropping a mining op. That's not saying "this moon is worth something intrinsically, and there's 10 like it in this constellation; we're going to war to get them for ourselves." There's zero incentive to do that now - pretty much all space has roughly the same quality of moons, so I'll just go somewhere else where those moons aren't being used. There's no incentive for me to do anythign more than "disrupt" - there's absolutely no incentive for me to come and "take." Old moons gave us that incentive, and were a major driver of conflict in EVE for the better part of a decade. CCP has utterly failed to recognize that value, and deliberately refused to give us some other reason to "take" instead.
---
This isn't a current state, but what bothers me is the frequency CCP says they're doing something(primarily balance and community involvement) and no follow through is done. Early on I felt great when they said they'd focus on balance but it eventually sizzles out after a few months when they touched the biggest problem ship at the time.  
---
I guess also how CCP has been shafting community people recently with a splintered pole. 
---
If I could get the adrenaline rush from other games I'd have won a long time ago.
---
give us a way to see applied ewar are ranges. Like using a t2 damp at 60km on a target, what is the applied strength of that damp. Maybe put in the stacking penalties as well?
---
I remember a Dev talking about this at fan fest. He said that the more information that needed to be stored for Killmails, the smaller the fights the servers could handle. It was in a TiDi roundtable. There was a big push to improve performance in fights, so it was even being floated around that maybe they'd get rid of killmails all together, but that got a lot of push back. I guess killmail generation takes a not so insignificant portion of server power. Considering how many people were working on streamlining code to improve fights and allow for more people to be in fights, I'd assume the pushback to something that would do the opposite would have come from a lot of people.
---
You say that thinking injector prices aren't gonna fall to 800m that day.
---
Thanks man, kind words much appreciated.
---
Make more isk than you lose + alliance SRP.
---
hold my beer..,
---
Awesome vid, can we expect some more Battleships in the future even though this is old?
---
Unpopular opinion - remove zkill, or better yet either remove killmails altogether or limit the amount of intel it can provide like obscuring the attacker numbers to something like № of people participating or just literally the one who got the last hit without any info on what ship was used...
---
lmao, what a sad story, 
---
wwwwwwaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
What?
---
What he is talking about would be awesome.
---
Give us more stuff to fight over.
---
Maybe start altering resource ratios among regions there's more incentive to invade and more incentive to try to sneak into owned space.
---
Right now endgame is all about finding an alliance so you can play, but it would be great to make soloing a bit more enjoyable at nullsec
---
I just disagree, that fighting over moons is not gone and I have been involved in it.  You say that it isn' t a persuasive metric as an anecdotal experience well the same to you then honestly.  I've been seeing and involved in cap and supercap fights in low sec so I still see the fun around it.  I hated passive income moons and that mining, it always seemed so un-acquirable for line members to see any of those resources.
---
as a dev this sounds horrible...i can only imagine the code quality...
---
I've heard that. It seems pretty intimidating, but it looks like I'll have to dive into one at some point.
---
For having +5 nullsec CSMs, they sure have gotten CCP to do jack about fixing it.
---
What's wrong with mining events?
---
WTS 30 Falcons and 50 Fozzie's for 1 Jon Lander...
---
If I can get some interesting fights, yeah, I will post em.
---
What happened to kendarr?
---
Thanks for the tips! Looks like mining groups would be the best bet for sure, but I'm pretty nervous about picking the right group.
---
Glad to hear Slyce won’t be left out in the cold like the poor souls in this long list of alliances:
---
.
---
Given my own suspicions that SP price is probably driving plex price, at this point, it might be interesting to dig into that... if you have the time and feel like doing the work, of course.  I'm just sitting here in my armchair.
---
So I have bounced in and out of EVE for a few years, but I seem to be missing the context for this.
---
Is this guy just defending microtransactions??
---
Not sure what else is going on.
---
Not possible I'm afraid, to build Supers and Titans you need a certain Infrastructure Hub upgrades and since those are only usable in nullsec, that's the only place you can build them.
---
Folks have looked into bringing them into WH's the old fashioned way but no WH has the mass for even a single one.
---
Exactly. OP is entitled AF.
---
Lol, clueless noob, did you even "Phoebe"? It was for years between Phoebe &amp; Lifeblood a very healthy Meta, small groups like ours could easily take R64-Moons from groups like PL, NCdot, Goons, Darkness, The Culture etc. and had income from PvP (you know casuals without 20 Rorqual-Alts, just 2-3 fully subbed accounts per person)
---
Continuing this analogy, the CEO of subway would take all his sandwich money and rather than reinvesting back into the parent company to make better sandwiches for the customer, he instead invested it into building a factory that specialized in producing toxic lead-based paints for childrens toys.
---
Leaving the actual sandwich company having to eat the loss of that capital wasted on a venture product that was dead in the water before the CEO even finished writing it down on his office white board.
---
Good advice! I love the idea of getting a Retriever as I would imagine I'll end up doing solo runs a bit even with a group. I may just plex my acc and get enough isk for that. :)
---
It would stimulate "content" *once*. Your big shot-in-the-arm sea change to the mechanics of EVE has the net effect of a wet fart.
---
He got kissed by a girl probably
---
I just tried to spin it.
---
F :(
---
That is an incredible guide!! Thanks! I really like the grids. I think I finally understand all the different ships involved.
---
Yup, not sure if you've seen the talk about game design that Mark Rosewater gave a few years ago, but one of his 20 (iirc) points was that people will do whatever it takes to win, so make sure you make that fun, otherwise your game will suck.
---
Remove skill injectors, problem solved.
---
Ugh, I'm upvoting a caprisunkraftfoods post. Ughhhhhhh.
---
For Horde it's as easy as clicking Apply to Corp. I don't know if it is as easy as KarmaFleet. E-Uni you learn about high impact bureaucracy when applying so it isn't as simple as the others (unless it's changed).
---
Nothing about skill injectors...
---
Fair enough.
---
The problem is that throwing out everything and re-starting is not a viable option (although arguably few of the ones I presented are :-P). Since a lot of the game design has gone into retaining old players (as opposed to ensuring that new players have opportunities). Bigger and bigger ship classes, SKINs, skill extractors and injectors, new (expensive) Triglavian ships and weapons systems, etc. etc. all are really cool for *old* players; not so much for new ones. 
---
Now, I can't particularly argue with this strategy, because many established players sub multiple accounts, and that's how CCP keeps the lights on, so they need to keep those dudes happy. The game in the long-term will wither and die, but it will keep making money for a little bit longer, at least.
---
[I got u fam](https://i.imgur.com/vwk9PDW.png)
---
First things firsts your going to want to multibox 4 accounts. Then fit up 4bill battleships and you shouldn’t have a problem... barring that, just wait it out, go check join a salvage fleet in your main’s alliance if your strapped for cash
---
The game provided on-ramp is to start doing the Seekers missions which are a basic tutuorials. Then start doing all the different Career Agents for free isk, items, and ships. At the end of the Advanced Military Training you get a free Destroyer (all the other free ships are Frigates). 
---
At that point you’re pretty well setup to wander the universe to do lvl 1 missions, the Sisters of Eve epic arc, anomalies, or exploration (scanning down signatures) and you’ll have some cash to replace ships if you lose them. 
---
But since there’s like 6 of you, you guys could really do whatever. I do recommend starting as Caldari though, because the biggest trade hub in the game, Jita, is a Caldari Navy run station and if you have a good rep with them, you get a discount on transactions. Not enough to really care when your just starting out, but enough to remember for later.
---
Fuuuuuuuu..... baited on a free shit post. Back to my hole!
---
I haven't actually done sov since the new system was introduced, but I have to admit I've never understood why the numbers were set so it takes several times longer to destroy a citadel than it did to capture a station including destroying the ihub.  A week-long campaign for a system is reasonable to me, and you do need some system to give weekend warriors a fighting chance, but you can still do that with somewhat shorter timer lengths.
---
I'm undoubtedly preaching to the choir here, though.
---
I've heard that, and I definitely like the venture. My main problem with it is I barely make enough in a week (2 hours a day, maybe 3 in a week) to replace it's fittings (the good stuff). Which means I can't do fun (stupid) things with it very often. (like null and wormhole stuff).
---
Might be true in goons? But certainly not like that for any other newbean null Corp
---
I started playing a few days too late, hit every day so far, unfortunately it ends.
---
To get around that, you could always give everything to a trusted public figure to organise a competition on similar lines in time to come...
---
plz gib
---
Actually, you did
---
Move CCP to London.
---
Exactly, what creates content is not large groups, or small groups, it is changes to the balance of the game that people have to react to. Going from small blocks -&gt; big blocks is content, but only have large static blocks that essentially never change...is not. That's heat death.
---
That will soon change though.
---
&gt; This set-up creates what is essentially a regressive tax on smaller entities
---
The phrase you're looking for is "[barrier to entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barriers_to_entry)".
---
I played the beta. I think you started in space, so you didn't even have to undock. I figured out how to move by doubleclicking but never got as far as warping somewhere and logged off like 15 minutes later when I believed you had to travel like 15000 km to the closest planet by going at 200m/s.
---
It took me a while to figure out. I was searching the text.
---
Thanks. Found it now. Chart legend duh!
---
And why did those fall? Because of a massive influx of external cash. Sure, if someone were willing to spend $100.000 on PLEX, they could get enough materials to try to fight Goons as in the Casino War; otherwise, they are uncontestable.
---
monochrome neocom looks better if you arent a child
---
Just join a NS alliance and venture mine near rorquals and you should be more than fine.
---
something else to consider - when people look at null blocs and consider how to stir up the meta or incentivize membership in smaller entities you still *always* must consider how that change could benefit the community as a whole (be it positive or negative).  
---
ex. banning cynos helps your t1 frigate avoid getting boson'd by 20 titans but it also makes travel a pain in the ass for everybody.
---
Cant wait to see them in action :D until now they were like "uhhh a neut 10 jumps out.. Dock up asap!!"..  Anyway.. Chaos Army are cool dudes.. Too bad they started renting after InPanic died :(
---
Yes.. I know, hence the pay more to win. Within the AT they will essentially have paid tiers (hoppers/buckets). The more you pay the more "resources you have access to" 
---
Like 'premium' ammunitions "that won't be for sale after the AT, only during, we promise"
---
Think I lost a couple brain cells reading all that...
---
The players sidestepping unrealistic expectations on the part of the devs is only part of the problem.
---
The other is the naivety of the devs who dont play the game at any "serious" level and therefor lack the proper context and first hand experience to make decisions that arent unrealistic to begin with.
---
&gt;The new system isn't perfect but the old one was a lot worse  
---
he wasnt asking for the old system back he was asking for a better one retard
---
OK, let's look at what we can add to make it better: a better intro/tutorial for newbros.
---
The current intro missions are criminally negligent in lulling newbies into thinking 1.0 sec = I'm safe from all harm.  What it should emphasize is that in high sec, your blapping comes at a cold calculation: can I alpha you into the nearest clone bay?  Is there someone else to pick up the loot?  Is it worth my current fit to do that?  Is the bounty or the sheer lolz worth it?  
---
Y'know... actually explain mechanics like station/gate camping, piracy, and so on.  I'd also possibly make noob systems (system only, not region) a reasonably safe zone until they learn the ropes - that is, instaban on station camping so you can't be the poor sucker who just rolls their first toon ever and gets blapped on the first undock.
---
I guess its t67 because thats the main sys from the. ARMY.. But yeah.. Its a pretty bad location..
---
An alliance-mate of mine did this. The response was a "sorry, but your not logging on for a log-on reward is not a problem with our services," essentially.
---
Forgot the most important part; remove  Hilmar.
---
For the orbital motion point, allow me to introduce you to /u/Santorine and his [Analysis of Basic Ship Maneuvers](http://eveismath.blogspot.com/2015/09/part-ii-analysis-of-basic-ship-maneuvers.html). Specifically the section on orbital motion (though some of the equations are clipped weird) provides guidance for how to calculate what the speed and actual orbit distance will be for a given orbit command using ship parameters.
---
\&gt; CCP devs are not allowed to play the game in leadership roles of large null-sec alliances.  
---
Probably to do with T20.
---
Oh so you're still going with the out of context quote then? It was explained multiple this last weekend by mittens himself that was in reference to reporting people to goons. If you suspect botting in any member of the coalition or associated renters you should report them to CCP because its their job and they are the only one who can actually tell who is a bot and who isn't.
---
I never expected the tanking graph to be "simple", it was just an idea because you asked ;)
---
For the orbiting formula, I found this one from the EVE forums in 2012:
---
 r = (A \* m \* v²) / (√(Vmax² - v²) \* 1000000)  
---
r = Orbital Radius  
---
A = Agility  
---
m = ship mass (in kg)  
---
Vmax = maximum velocity for the ship  
---
v = orbit velocity for the ship 
---
Not sure if it's still accurate
---
Daily reminder, they’re giving away more than 2x as much SP as they reimbursed for the 8+ months of random chat outages last year
---
Yes, well, in a "perfect sandbox," the largest groups grow faster than smaller groups, and will continue to get larger exponentially. This means that in the long-term, we are locking in the supremacy of these groups. Yes, this makes for a beautiful sandbox that creates a semi-accurate picture of the world we live in... but it's not sustainable. People will get bored or discouraged or just straight-up pushed out or suppressed.
---
If the game is to survive, something has to change.
---
I mean the game needs revenue. Anyone with a few years experience and sitting in the right alliance can easily plex their own account by moon mining a few hours each weekend. That's why I say there's a delicate balance between ruining the game balance but also being able to afford to keep servers running and support. It's actually amazing that the game has been going for as long as it has.
---
If you are looking for an honest, unvarnished answer I can provide one. I'll also describe my personal lead up.  
---
Knowing that some of these events were coming, I planned ahead by doing the things I needed to at work so that I would be available as well as plenty of the "honey-do" list items and generally spending time with family before and after, so that this big time sink of a day would be doable. I spent 10-12 hours or so in each of the three battles at X47 and 4-6 for a few of the 9-4 fights.  
---
So... why do it?  
---
* This is going to be one of the few times that you are going to be able to participate in a truly colossal knock-down drag out fight.  
---
* These fights, out of all the things in EVE currently, matter. There are thousands of smaller structures, but less than 100 total locations a titan or super can dock and killing these makes the game one step back towards being risky for those big ships.  
---
*     There is a real potential to be able to headshot a notable personality that you either have a bone to grind with or just want to take a shot at their big shiny titan. I particularly enjoyed seeing Sort's titan on grid and awaiting the call to target and primary it. Then he died.  
---
*  Titan combat in tidi (and probably outside of it) has a certain Age of Sail feel, where everyone reloads and the unleashes a full broadside of doomsdays and guns on targets to wipe them out before reps can catch them.  
---
* As long as modules aren't doing the permanent cycle/red cycle thing, it's not that terrible for me. I fire the big guns. Swap to the super carrier and shoot some of the LOLaoebursting Punishers. Then I spend 5-10 minutes laughing in coms with people, a beer and loving on my dog.  
---
* Watching the losing side come to Reddit and "yea, but.." because they can't possible just say "good fight" and enjoying the mountains of salt and excuses and circular logic to support the punchline of "we lost". -Also- If my side loses? I'll say good fight, and I'll try to mean it!  
---
* Also enjoy shooting MTUs that all the trash drop trying to sweep the field during the fight (all sides have those guys).  
---
- I do wish with all of those people in the zone, you didn't have 20-30 dudes spamming local, but eh- you gotta get attention some how when you don't matter.
---
&gt;he Spire - most of the work done by lazerhawks, not sigs
---
yeah cause its not like you tried to blob them and couldn't because sigs ran cover for them so they could toaster your shit right off the map... boy if you guys are trying to spin letting a whole rental region burn this bad already I can't wait to see you how you take a real invasion.
---
*sigh*
---
Yeah, I realized that after I wrote it, but editing the post is a massive pain in the ass because it undoes the formatting every time I try, so I have to re-do it all manually. Sorry.
---
That's not the real reason why, but not understanding that is exactly why Delve is what it is, and why you're still fed up about it.
---
^ Alq is this your alt account talking to yourself ?
---
PPPI is (mostly) minerals.  SPPI is all the things that go into manufacturing that aren't PPPI, which is mostly PI and moongoo, but also capital parts.
---
oh let them have their morale spin while it lasts, in a month or two they'll be evacing and crying about not getting good fights and how goons are ruining the game and claiming they are taking the high road and blue balling us by letting us burn structures down uncontested one after another.
---
Then since you're so smart suggest a new one? Now get out my comment chain.
---
I doubt it was the developers that made the decision to make events like this
---
I don't think it's that they don't matter as much as they don't care about people who choose to krab in expensive shit while supers are deployed
---
I mean what's the point in voting ? 
---
Like i have have faithfully voted every year only to see null representation get stronger and stronger at what point can i say fuck it this is clearly not working ?
---
I guess you're ripe to move to wormhole
---
Just delete eve
---
I have wanted to try out a RHML SNI, but i really just can't get over the reload. I think it kind of works on a rattlesnake, since you still have good drone dps to compensate during the reload. It gets a really nice tank though, better than the rattle since you have an extra mid.
---
Still painful watching the time it takes to lock a cruiser in the SNI though (was like 12-13s from what i could tell in the video and 10s for a BC). Maybe one day CCP will address the scan resolution on the SNI and Rokh (at least).
---
That's what I thought. I just didnt know how PI figures into it and how it applied since theres different levels. Thank you.
---
I see your points but I disagree. From my perspective, equalizing the value of moons is a good thing as - as you say in your comment - it disincentivizes larger groups from doing anything more than disrupting the little guys trying to get a foothold.
---
Did you ever, as a small corp, try to bash a moon mining POS owned by shadow cartel or similar in order to establish yourselves? you would get a dread fleet dropped on you in 20 minutes or less.
---
I mean slowly more and more folks are leaving the game or becoming pseudo inactive already i suspect there isn't gonna be a single game the eve players go to most will spread out and the game will make it's money of isk grinding online until the people that are still in it well stop being in the game.
---
&gt; When EVE had that few players before, CCP had to support the in-game economy by having key things built by NPCs.
---
Wow. I didn't know that. When was it happening?
---
Theres only one "newbean" null corp.
---
ur point with citadels grows stronger every day as the mass of structure spam piles higher and higher. i remember when u could harass a staging station to provoke a fight or fuck around on a grid until their one competent virtue prober came out to warp 30 home defense dudes on your gang  
---
rorqs had a major part to play with capital proliferation as well since they saturated the market with dirt cheap minerals making the cost of a super/titan drop like crazy
---
I had the same problem during the early-April event - I was on a trip in Armenia and had nothing but my phone, so I couldn't log in. I put in a ticket and got basically the same response. It makes sense really, but it was a bit of a bummer.
---
While I certainly agree that Eve has its fair share of issues, I can’t say I see it in any sort of rapid decline. I’m a “relatively” new player so I’m not claiming to be any sort of expert or veteran. I’ve probably put in a full year of active gameplay over the last couple years and only recently have I gotten really into the game. I love it! I’ve been playing regularly, logging in every day for the last 7 months or so and I’m having a blast. From personal experience, I can say with certainty that there’s no lack of things to do and enjoy.
---
I’ve done solo PvP, small gang stuff in WHs, small gang stuff in Null, lived in a WH for a bit and there was never a lack of content/fun. I just joined Dreddit to check out the large scale NS sov stuff and there’s plenty to keep me coming back... Anyway, I guess it’s a different game to different people? I’m having fun leastways.
---
Matias, while I respect you for starting Brave and setting our principles in stone, you haven't played EVE in quite a long time.
---
EVE does not need to be "saved".  Log in and see the nightly shenanigans going on all over New Eden. 
---
You are reading a super-vocal minority of players here.  Not representative of the actual playerbase.  
---
/r/Eve can be useful and fun, but it can also be a weekly outrage machine, stoked by memes and brigading, disconnected from most of the playerbase.
---
That sounds overly optimistic, TBH.
---
i didn't say i was going to suggest one either i was just calling you a retard, you retard
---
Hm and where are goons in kalevala now? And I see the ihubs are back :)
---
\*FEDUP ;-)
---
Removing supers from lowsec would be an indirect nerf to projection. You'd have to move longer distances and potentially through hostile sov to get around the map with the super blob.
---
Really the best and only suggestion to get CCP to pull their finger out is to unsub.
---
If you're not having fun in the game with your current corp, find somewhere you're having fun.
---
A little late, but meh...
---
What stopped people from using Alt accounts, using false account information on a VPN?
---
1. That wasn't the only thing said, that was just all that made it to reddit in a spin attempt.
---
2. DeadCo formed over 700...
---
Thanks for posting up such an interesting AMA. 
---
A bit of an obscure question perhaps, but did you have any encounters with the elusive TomB during your time on the CSM?
---
i’m not saying ihubs weren’t lost, that region was quite literally nc.’s smallest estate and so it makes sense that when it is further than our caps can reach and illogical to send support fleets that far away, it will burn. as it has.
---
&gt; CCP has been trying for almost a decade now to push EVE into a higher tier of logged in players, with absolutely no success. So what can they do?
---
As someone who has bounced in and out of EVE for years I can answer this.
---
Be more solo player friendly.  WoW got to where it is from casuals.  It was the first MMO to really embrace casual players.
---
They are kind of trying with the events. Fly to this thing pew-pew some stuff, collect rewards.
---
I actually liked them, then they power creeped them so my lower skilled guys couldn't do them well, even in a Gila.
---
The solo stuff they have also isn't that great.  
---
I was big into running relic/data sites.  I liked sneaking around low sec and finding big money.
---
But the scanning just takes a toll on you.  It is clunky (even with the improvements) and over-complicated.  Just let me pick the target, send the probes, and have them scan down.  I don't mind the extra time as they home in on them as long as I don't have to manually move little bubbles around.
---
The other content problem is that it is a pain to find.  I liked the idea of Abyssal sites, but a few lost server connections costing me ships was enough to swear them off forever.  
---
The real bottleneck is always going to be skills.  For me nothing says "don't bother" like seeing a cool ship I want to try and looking at a 30 day+ skill plan.  Well guess I will go do something else.
---
Time-gating is always going to lock out a large group of people.  
---
I know injectors exist, but in a closed economy they just ballooned up in price to fast for me to bother with.  
---
Skills should be bonuses, not requirements. 
---
I made billions in exploration and I had nothing to spend it on as I slowly watched my queue tick up.   If I can buy it, I should be able to fly it.  Fuck me if I lose it.
---
Yeah they were pretty useless too
---
have you ever heard the phrase "Don't hate the player, hate the game?"
---
you can't blame people for acting in their self interest.
---
Yeah, I remember starting in space... I think I started right clicking on things until I noticed the warp option lol.
---
TUTORIAL? FUCKNO
---
Orbit mwd on you'll be fine
---
We fled because of a few sigs? OMEGALUL
---
We fled because horde was literally ratting in like 4 systems in Fade and a handful of systems in Pure Blind. That’s nothing to sustain an alliance of horde’s size.
---
The sigs that deployed there were so insignificant, I didn’t even remember anyone deployed.
---
what, facts won’t age well? goons are going to get clapped in the north. will be ez pz

My one-man corp recently had an Athanor fall into it's lap due to the generosity(?) of u/gooncuckbtw and his [shenanigans](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bmzs06/vfk_by_right_ing_now_structure_transfer_offer/). Having never had the pleasure of running my own space station, I set out from Jita with a buzzard and an astero to gate my way up to VFK. My plan was to make it to the station, change the name, and talk shit in local. I figured I would watch it blow up and then go into a wormhole and hunt explorers or whatever. I didn't intend to dock again in Jita without a kill.
---
The first half of the trip was through high sec and was uneventful. Things got a little interesting when I got into Pure Blind and a couple of smart bombing Rohks split my two-man fleet. I logged off for a little while hopping they would get bored and leave. After about 20 minutes I logged back in, saw the gate was clear, but the dudes were still in local, plus now there was a Kikimora on d-scan. I made a few pings, got my Astero past the now vacant gate and logged off for the night. I knew I had a couple of days before the station would be gone so it was easy to be patient, and besides, I was only about 9 systems away by that time.
---
Last night, I had about an hour after work before dinner with the family, so I figured I would check out the system see if I could get any closer to VFK. It was dead and DOTLAN showed very little activity so I guess I got cocky. I continued to make my way through Pure Blind and into Fade, making pings as I went. 
---
I got as far as E-9ORY when my scout got "caught" at a gate camp. As soon as I saw the Sabre, my heart rate ramped up and buck fever set in. I decided to get the Sabre to engage my Buzzard while my Astero jumps in and catches him off guard. Instead of Clk+mwd, I de-cloaked and tried to warp, the Sabre drop a bubble and engaged. I switched back to my Astero, try to jump through and realize I was 70k off the gate! WTF? Bye Bye Buzzard. My eyes got podded back to Jita. Shit. 
---
Stubbornly, I decided to try kill the Sabre whatever the cost. My astero was "hunter" fit and I figured I could get under his guns and let my drones tear him a new one. I jumped through and my heart dropped when I saw the Legion sitting about 40k away. Fuck it. I am already balls deep. Let's get this party started. I surprised the Sabre by approaching and tackling him, but the Legion had me in my pod within two volleys. My drones never made it to the field. 
---
I guess I had it coming. I got messaged by the guy and he seems a cool bro. 
---
Once I got "sent" back to Jita, I grabbed an interceptor I had in my hanger and hauled ass back. This time, no gate camps, and I got to sit at the helm of my first station. I changed the name, got bored and started my way back. Sadly it was destroyed a few hours ago.
---
I learned a few things, had a blast, and maybe made a new friend. Thanks for reading.
---
I hate all the corporate speak. It's a fucking video game. You're not changing the world.
---
So your grand strategy to fix the game is to ask people to voluntarily avoid doing the best they can in it.         
---
Not a great plan.
---
Let's see, moving subscriptions from account to character, proper many to one char-to-acc, character mapping, altering stored procedures, changing API, unit tests, regression tests. About a month for **a senior full stack dev with brains**. You clearly aren't one.
---
The only change is that faction weapons can use tech2 ammo, it's really only a change at the high end of game play
---
And what’s their special interest?
---
Uh, you did come to venal for us lol, nice try on the spin though. Doesn’t really work when we can read corp pings bud...
---
Oh dear god they're spreading...
---
No, they were the target, you just failed to get any LUL
---
Dude, CCP isn't going to give you free SP for sucking their dicks.
---
Yeah, but that wasn't your assertion.
---
You don't need to spin to say the tke campaign was not a success.
---
I would assume 90% of offers are people trying to recruit you, then poach your active members.
---
This is eve, nobody really wants to help you.
---
Yes, but that’s essentially what the person I replied to is suggesting, and why I said it is a bad idea.
---
Bots don't really give a fuck what weapon systems they use, they are automated.
---
All this does is make drone boats shit for PvE, and bots will continue to bot.
---
The Horde guy seems to be missing a few tentacles.
---
I'm using newbean as a generic term here, possibly my bad. Most people I interact with in-game use that term in a generic way, but maybe that's just in the circles I play with?
---
I was actually thinking about this earlier on my drive to work and I like the "stimulant" mechanic more than "injection".
---
It still maintains some of the idea of time being a limiting factor rather than instantly getting the skills you need. I think something akin to injectors was needed to keep eve going in the future but the implementation of the mechanic was terrible.
---
Yeah but your statment “kalevala lost a few ihubs” means literally nothing if its effects aren’t felt now. 
---
IIRC horde had partisans deployed in GOTG space and main horde was fighting while goons deployed in kalevala, which explains the delayed response to the kalevala attack.
---
Then I'd suggest you're interacting with other "beans" as that term is wholly owned by one organization.
---
Might just be me but red on black is horrible to read.
---
&gt; Down venture me.
---
Dude, this is the *point* of incursions. Hell, they should attack player-built structures. Would be a great way to deal with citadel spam.
---
Glad you were able to sit in it and make it yours! Thanks for the follow
---
PBUH ~The Mittani~
---
just set local to the same mechanic as wormholes instead 
---
problem solved
---
Dunno, running out of enemies to shoot makes the game only more stale.
---
I did that on both of my accounts, they said they can't do anything about it. So hope it works out better for y'all.
---
If they wanted to balance this game off of the economy, they could rework skillbooks into mastery certificate plugins that you can earn through pve missions and various other tasks. Their rarity, accessibility and usefulness provides them varying market values. Beginner ones can remain in NPC stations. However, this game doesn't want to be balanced off of the economy anymore, but off of ship design because ccp wants to increase ease of ship accessibility for the sake of profit.
---
I still do not see how afk-multiboxing Rorquals while tabbed out to netflix bcuz NEAR2/TACO/Theta will save them is more active gameplay than handish piloting 10 DSTs through Lowsec Systems to empty/refill Towers.
---
People only want the other guys to take the high road, while they gain advantage on the easy path
---
Dark red on black? ick.

---
Tbh I've been having fun playing Warframe. Yeah it's not 10/10, but at least it's free. Solid little MMO
---
thanks for the ama quick question that you may or may not be able to answer.
---
How much of the dev budget and time was allocated to fixes, new features, and other projects? If you could give a percentage.
---
There is no main home defence :D Back when I was member of HKASS I was planning to get them into Ruptures, Muninns, Lokis, Canes, Carriers. Luckily I decided to join the war in the south. Too many carebears up there. You wanna form a fleet? You'll get 10 people, in case you are lucky. Most of them with meta fit t1 ships, unable to allign to gates or anchor up. Battlecoms? Lol, never heard of and not willing to learn about it.   
---
When ever something was tackled, their one and only hope has been the help of Combat Wombat. And I guess they're already pretty annoyed.  
---
And yes, T-6 is a terrible staging. Atleast they got some decent ansiblex connections (well, incase they are fueled, lol) into all directions. There is one logged of Titan in T6 for bridging, but the guy who owns it, is pretty inactive. Maybe 3 active supercarrier pilots (but their only experience using it, is ratting), almost no fax pilots at all, dread pilots maybe 2 or 3 active ones. They got 350 Accounts registered, with about 150 humans behind those accounts. Of that 150 humans, 2/3rds or more are inactive. So yeah... Have fun farming them :)
---
I agree with most of this but why not these:
---
&gt;Nerf ratting
---
&gt;Nerf mining
---
One other point worth mentioning:
---
&gt;Limit local
---
&gt;Nerf T3s
---
I feel like I didn't really hear complaints about local before the massive HK T3 nerf.  I know that it was a side effect of wanting to nerf T3C fleets but I wonder if they could make a ship line that could emulate a HK T3C.  I feel like this also falls in line with:
---
So I have joined the game in the caldari navy and my friends should be meeting up together in the same area throughout the day. 
---
Starting in an area with active trade hubs should be rather helpful. Thanks for the information.
---
&gt; Never really ratted in null but here is my opinion  
---
Fun fact, rats in null turbo aggro drones and especially fighters.
---
&gt; I take offense to this!
---
&gt; It was a rather unknown game
---
Retard...
---
Yeah, I was too. So, when the time came, I simply chose the Corp that had a most well written recruiting mail. :D And the best recruiting video ofc.
---
What if CCP Meanface would show up at the doors of the botters and pull out their power cords?
---
The posts in here are bitter shit. I've been playing since 2006, on and off, it's entering somewhat of a good phase for smallgang. It isn't as dire as painted here. There's good and bad, just come back and try it yourself.
---
No. Building supers requires having an I-Hub anchored with a certain upgrade I can't remember the name of. You obviously can't do that in wormholes.      
---
Also, one of the main benefits of wormhole space is that supers aren't allowed in. So no.
---
dirt cheap highly effective hard to kill and little to lose structures
---
instant perfect intel via local
---
I'm not sure it's a single mechanic that change - it's probably the players as well.
---
In CS:GO, a weapon (the aug) got cheaper in a patch, and after a while the pros started using it, because played right, it was really powerful - but nobody had really anticipated that. The after some time everybody complained that it was too powerful, and that the game got stale - and the price change got reverted.
---
But people kept using it, because now they realized it was actually a good weapon.
---
We'd have to change things in eve, but also people's behaviours in eve to get back to the good old days(tm). I think it's also the players and the expectations that have changed by now.
---
Well if we end up playing this game as our Saturday night game knowing that big ships are reachable is definitely a thing. 
---
Just like any mmo. End game content is the goal and if it’s not fun or reachable then why play? While we hold out hope that a new mmo worth playing comes out this year or next.
---
Didn't the Phoebe jump changes already address that? They certainly did with respect to nullsec groups like mine projecting across lowsec on a whim.
---
Make PI less tedious (Templates, reduce the number of structures and the need to make and manage links, longer extraction cycles and significantly less m3 used)  and more valuable, especially for the less common planet types.
---
Then make POCOs more desirable by making PI less valuable if there isn't one in orbit. 
---
Now you have a type of Semi-Passive income that comes close to moon mining (pop in once a week or every other week to harvest valuable materials), it's available for all the line members and not just the elite, It won't be *super* valuable since being easy means more people will do it, and it has POCOs and their timer mechanics to fight over instead of structure timers.
---
A TESTie who wants less blue on his overview?       
---
Say it ain't so!
---
I'm going to assume you're asking which trade hubs are the largest. Jita 4-4 in The Forge is the largest trade hub and in Caldari space.
---
Not on their own. A citadel can die. But 50 Astras in a single system makes it nigh on impossible to evict.
---
Citadel spam is real.
---
A tiny amount of SP for everyone subscribed on a random Tuesday in March.
---
did you really just say the reason your offensive war petered out is because the... people you're fighting don't have balls?
---
The VNI videos had specific instructions to avoid that, granted my info is pretty dated.
---
1. Yes im with you. 
---
2. Wont work without extreme heavy load on the Server. 
---
3. Was an oopsie by ccp and they have no clue how to reverse their "fix"
---
4. Just dilutes pricing and wont get farmers to donate
---
&gt; **Resource Depletion and Scarcity:** What if rorqual mining a system for months at a time actually depleted its resources? What if money moons gradually became less money (while other moons gradually improved if not drilled regularly)? What if killing off thousands upon thousands of pirates actually weakened their cartel in that sector of space?
---
This idea is old. Depletion wouldn't make alliances fight for space. It would make them conquer as much space as they need to optimally farm, and then cycle regions.
---
Scarcity is nice though. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9xxc8s/adaptive_anomaly_respawns_an_idea_that_would_fix/) is my proposal that offers making total farm spawning in a system a factor of total farm done across all nullsec.
---
That post by Olmeca is brilliant and sadly got downvoted out of existence within an hour or two.  But I think of it almost every day as the single biggest fix this game could see.  It responds to the idea that nullsec blocs would just win again with linear resource scarcity, while still making there a risk-reward for owning more space, while right now there is just a risk.
---
But would you have 100 man bomber fleets out hunting a handful of barges?
---
Yep. Metrics like damage, reps, etc. to display on killmails need to be tracked and stored somewhere. This takes money, and resources away from something else. 
---
The whole point of the producers for EVE is balancing tradeoffs and feature dev. All the cool ideas in this thread are cool, but an absolute technical nightmare.  This is probably the largest reason for not chasing some dreams. The paths chosen probably have metrics and some kind of ROI and vision they align to.
---
delete local
---
wormholer btw
---
The problem is from the AMA it sounds like Hilmar actively makes (or made) lower level decisions than I would expect.
---
the consequences to the Phoebe changes was that PL etc spent more ISK creating dread caches accross EVE, come on, if you are not flairbaiting you should know this
---
also, you could wait for the POS to come out of its timer and then hotdrop on the attackers when they go in for round 2, that would give you enough time to transit ships to a system in range
---
Player count, lack of marketing en mass and a lack of new player recruiting tools in and out of game.  Almost everything currently in game would be fixed or better off with 50-100k more players daily.
---
People said the same thing about two Keepstars on the same grid in a wormhole system.
---
serves you right for being a slaver!
---
But seriously, story time. Must have been more to it than that.
---
&gt;Or a DD in my dread then

That could be cool, a specialised dread hull that can fit a DD and nothing else.

---
I honestly cannot see how they could make the rats any more drone aggressive without out and out removing ships with drones as an botting option, which would be no real problem for a bot program just using lasers or missiles. I used to carrier rat for fun, the full on rage-hate boner for fighters from rats is silly lame. At least for how squishy they are, even in a carrier with +durability.
---
Apparently not but okay.
---
&gt; You need to find something else that fattens alliance leader's wallets to fight over.
---
Like Hisec-Trading-Citadels, that decimated one of the steadiest ISK-Sinks in the game, trading taxes
---
I think if I took one out again today I would at least fit a sig amp, and I am not sure if it would be insane to use one of those mids for a sebo?
---
It does make me miss Suas.
---
Better?
---
Yes, someone else linked your post in one of the earliest comments, and my overall impression was that it was more detailed and better thought-out than my proposal :D.
---
I wish these were still being published , I'd subscribe!
---
Any suggestions?
---
this is quality radakos posting keep going
---
You obviously have no clue HOW much content POS-Towers provided compared to Athanors. I do not mine, it is like watching a painted wall dry, why should I force myself to attend 1 week of timers? There is nearly no loot (mostly unfitted) and the stuff you looted from POS Hangars are going to safety now ....
---
No? I am saying when we take small gangs into nearby space, people dock up or drop supers.
---
The offensive war petered out because sov war is aids.
---
Let's take a stab at looking at Damage tracking today.
---
* Damage values are generated in "real time". 
---
* Those numbers need to be aggregated accurately in "real-time" to be populated on killmails.
---
* The raw damage logs need to be retained for some period of time
---
* The killmails are also retained for a period of time
---
* Killmails break down aggregate received for a ship, and then break down aggregate contributions per involved character.
---
The above takes a lot of real time processing, and logging (storage). To start tracking logi reps is extra load on these processes, and would probably require refactoring of the way killmails are calculated, stored and displayed (UI, Database, Services all need work). This would also impact external public APIs and such, whereby consumers would need to update to consume a new version that supports logi. 
---
All of the above also requires user testing &amp; validation, QA, UAT, announcement, metrics on usage, and some kind of key-result that management would want to see it influence (# subscriptions, # of active players, etc.).
---
I really want this, but it's hard to know if it's a good or bad call by management, without knowing what the other contenders for the dev resources were. Was it Abyssal space? Solving 1000 player battles (generates media attn)? New player experience?
---
He is right  everyone just needs to unblue each other
---
freedom
---
Yes, that was amazing. Still sad I didn't get to whore on them.

Good. Dead weight that doesn't deploy.
---
Wow! Much better!
---
Yeah definitely know about the content mr. high and mighty.  The point of attending timers is for your organization rather than yourself at that point.  Maybe there should be some loot dropped but at the same time I do also like Asset Safety and not having to lose everything if I decide to afk abit in lieu of real life.  I also like both mining and Pvp.  Mining is not watching paint dry to me, though sometimes I will admit it is and I do wish it was more...active.
---
Especially less blue USTZ entities. A lot of our "big" blues were non-USTZ entities blued to cover war timezones. I don't actually care that much about that. I'll let our other TZs comment if they have a shortage of enemies.
---
So basically rotating command dessies to keep jumping the fleet along
---
INN actually did a very good writeup on The Summer of Rage a couple years ago. [Here's a link](https://imperium.news/2011-summer-rage/). Specifically take note of the price of the monacles ($100) that was referenced in Hilmar's email.
---
next time, pop 2 sets
---
This is true, and I guess if they announced a new game, no one would invest in plex/injectors etc. The would mean any development would have to be completely finished by the time its announced (good luck with that!).
---
Budgeting for EVE definitely doesn't work like that.
---
We could make only the rudest guesses based on what number of personnel were allocated to each dev team (at the time of CSM 8: Koramaku, Game of Drones, Space Glitter, Super Friends, a couple of others). And each dev team had a series of goals for the number of two-week sprints between releases, which varied between items that were fixes and items that were new features.
---
So Game of Drones (say) might be assigned one set of fixes and two new features for a given expansion, but that didn't mean that EVE development was 33% fixes and 67% new features, both because that dev team was only one of many and because that dev team (and all the others) would for the most part get completely different tasks from expansion to expansion.
---
So there's no way I or any other CSM member could answer your question.
---
Ironically, a sig amp only SNI is still only like 108mm, so its pretty useless. The cargo expander is better since you get more cap charges. A scripted SEBO puts you at 150mm, while the rattle is 125mm. So if you throw a mid away on a SEBO, you're better off using the rattle since you lose the only advantage to the SNI over the rattle, which is a better tank.  
---
You also can't rely on the SEBO always being scripted for scan res, since you may need it for targeting range to counter damps or ECCM to resist jams.  Doesn't help that both the SEBO and Sig amp are % based. So adding a % to a low number normally doesn't produce great results from the get go.
---
So no one is coming north, then?
---
Um, it's free stuff.
---
either way, it's a recoverable effect
---
white text black background pls
---
It's not this. It's purely influencing business strategy and leadership team to bring an idea onto the roadmap. 
---
Scrum is after it's on the backlog. It doesn't get to the backlog, or onto dev tracks unless leadership agree with the direction.
---
They're not going to do that without strong incentives, and only CCP can provide those incentives.
---
&gt; I do also like Asset Safety and not having to lose everything if I decide to afk abit in lieu of real life.
---
Damn, how did we do that over a decade before. If there was something like NPC-Stations you could store your stuff in safely.
---
The point you raised is basically catering the game towards people not logging in and punishing the ones that do.
---
I feel like they just gave us an update on that number recently and it surprisingly hadn't moved much.
---
It was never fixed. 
---
CCP said they fixed the chat system and all they did was break it more, old issues still there along with new ones. How they managed to change the entire system and still have the same issues is beyond me, but regardless, they remain. =*(
---
\*bald eagle appears out of nowhere with a tear in its eye; Lee Greenwood tune can be heard in the background\*
---
Hey, someone who isn't all about, make the game better for "my style of game play".  I solute you.
---
Looking better is less important than fulfilling its function.
---
But I am a child. Are you a grown man playing vidja games?
---
Have no fear Reddit Fam - A CCP White Knight has come to save us all!
---
I try to train 1 month+ skills at a time so I can avoid looking at it.
---
I’m not a goon for 4 years so I don’t care honestly, I just watch and notice
---
Wrong about the WC/Legacy war - Legacy doesn't really need WC space, Legacy is trying to burn out WC but it's not happening, Legacy fights the war for "content", Legacy has rn no way to win it and WC doesn't want Legacy sov.
---
Idk dog, a 180mm dualprop xlasb vaga is fire.
---
For sure, anything is reachable. I just feel like people sometimes stress about getting to the end-game ASAP in various MMOs, which prevents them from enjoying the journey there.
---
Faction won't have a huge impact on your gameplay overall unless you decide to go full RP and say, only fly ships of a certain faction. You can get into some good stuff with a group of around 5 pilots, from really viable small gang pvp to just having chill mining fleets. Have fun and remember the best ship, is friendship! ♥
---
I was tempted to resub honestly. But I set it aside and now it's far, far less tempting since I can't get the good shit.
---
More shit will always win against less shit. So the only way to actually make the game accessible and not just a fuckfest of 1 or 2 big coalitions is to either intentionally or not break them up. give corps and alliances reasons to not be a part of that big coalition, that will generalte more diffrent groups and all of nullsec wont be that 1 group of neckbears who have a stranglehold on any casual player that undocks. I dont have the answer to how or when or if even. But nothing else will truly make the playing field any better without restricting people unnessecarily.
---
It's also CCP desperately trying to get user counts up, but faffing it up in standard fashion
---
That's so wholesome!
---
Actual prediction based on history: Goons will kill a keepstar in a tidi shit fest, we will lose some titans, Goons will get bored and go home 2 weeks later.
---
You mean the ones that could get hell camped and were often not close to the places your alliance owned or lived?  Yeah that was great /s  But really, that was also awful.  The point I raised is catering to actually being a real life person, its not punishing anyone.
---
If you join a FW group you actually lose targets. Not sure if this is a concern for you, but something to consider. 
---
If solo/small gang is what you're after I would recommend finding a group that lives in or near FW space that does small gang. You will have less 'friends' but pros and cons to this! 
---
Check out Slightly Sexual. corp, small gang specialists that live near FW space with a few buddies. I would be happy to help you learn the nuances of pvp and get you all set up to make pixel explosions!
---
Horde definitely has more action going on than anyone else, I do like them because I was with them earlier so I don’t want to be biased and just say yes, join Horde, but if you want as much action as you can get then they probably are the best choice
---
Maybe we could just direct them to a low sec group or an FW group - just expose them to a different gameplay - but I guess it's all about who frequents the reddit - majority of EVE players dont give a rats ass about the existence of this reddit.
---
Anyways, feel like I'm ranting now.
---
I can count on one hand the number of times we went to all that effort to use a dread cache for non-supercap frag opportunities. I think a lot of people outside PL think they know a hell of a lot more about our dread caches than they think they do; the reality is lowsec stopped being interesting when valuable moons went away as conflict drivers. Dropping on an athanor is just fucking boring.
---
&gt; most pilots from EVE uni tend to graduate
---
Perhaps of those that actually graduate.  How many have simply "won" EVE?  I'm going to bet "most" have given up on the game.
---
Wait, recruiting videos? hahaha there we go!!
---
From my perspective, Reddit turned into a cry fest most days so I stopped participating.   Unsure about the rest, but I was not entertained.
---
this might be peak dinobrain
---
If we got wind of asset safety being removed, we'd forcibly unanchor all of our major structures before the patch day, to force all line member assets into asset safety. Then, we'd move into NPC and never allow our members to store anything meaningful in structures again. We'd probably have to convince CCP to separate docking and tether ACL rights, but I think we could probably pull that off.
---
Why would we ever allow ourselves such a retarded risk vector like storing shit where it can be looted, if alternatives exist?
---
The reward IS the wormhole. :D I think you do get progress toward the Agency stuff but what you find inside the wormholes (sites, gas, etc) can be super profitable. Make sure you look up whatever sites you find on the [wiki](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org) before warping to as sometimes they'll have nasty sentry guns/rats waiting.
---
In CCP's defense it would be almost impossible to have SP farms not be profitable. If they weren't profitable people would stop them and then the supply of injectors would decrease and the prices rise to where they were profitable again. I'm curious what mechanic would prevent this?
---
No, you need sov to build titans.
---
I have sold them in advanced :D when it was more than 1B, titan is in hangar :D
---
I have to admit I have bought some way too expensive components for my venture in the past. But I also do genuinely struggle making 10 mill in a week simply because I play for 6 or 7 hours a week, and mine for maybe 4 hours total. I'll spend more time in the future, but... yeah, you're definitely right on the pain of NS and WH soloing
---
thing is most players see that a linemember in null have 2+ accounts, a large part of the player base never elave high sec, and those guys usually don't have more than 1 account

That's good advice! I doubt I'll ever get to the point of multiboxing VNIs, and while I've done some PvE and exploration, I just like the laser space rock simulator more. Thanks for those names of alliances, I'll check into them!
---
You think? I would have thought or better yet, hoped, that a group like that is quite good at player retention Then again hard to say, they wont come out themselves and give us stats of their own player activity/retention.
---
I indeed care about losing a tril and will gladly accept donations from people who don't :)
---
Pretty much this. No fucks for those that are dumb.
---
Again, I don't know. I have not been hanging out with Liberty; however, in my nearly 15 years playing this game, the only time I see the sort of vein popping "you guys actually suck so fucking bad" kind of vibe you are giving off is when they are actually upset because the other group of people they are talking about is causing serious disruption in their game play. 
---
Fair enough though, maybe you aren't intending to give off that vibe. If that's the case, just to let you know, and I know you probably won't buy this since I am--in fairness--a non-liberty sig goon, but that's how you are coming off. Honestly though, despite being a goon, I really have no dog in this particular reddit warrior race.
---
Let's cut to the chase: remove *cynos* - including coverts - from lo-sec. Lo-sec will never be more than null's back yard until this happens.
---
Actually all of the graphs I've added are the ones I had on my google sheet, which I've used for theorycrafting myself. I also have "basic falloff" graph there (which I am using for ewar and reps), which I wanted to transfer, but unsure how.
---
Which graphs would I want to include? There're tons of numerous parameters which would fit into this graph: scanres (damps), lockrange (damps), tracking speed (TDs), optimal range (TDs), falloff range (TDs), signature (TPs), speed (web strength), RR power of each type, and so on, and so on.
---
Do i implement each of these types as separate graph? Do I allow to target existing fits, do I let specify target parameters manually, or both? (some targets have resistance to webs/ewar/RRs, hence it also might be important)
---
I honestly have no clue how to handle it UI-wise.

This right here.  Hasnt been enough real war essentially

The sad thing is I currently just started training light fighters V--I just finished heavy fighters V--and that 1 million sp is only going to cut 15 or so days...

Why do people say low sec is d ead?  I live in low sec and theres content around if you go hunting.  Just curious.
---
Eagles are just a mistake in general, imo
---
You'd still be able to jump *out* of lo-sec. Null is significantly self-sufficient now in any case, and what it's not self sufficient in, is easily moved in smaller ships than JFs.
---
I think the fact that blueing everyone you can to rat and mine in peace is considered "doing the best you can" in the game says more than the retarded OP tried to.

I mean, given the mechanics that is "the best you can do". I dunno about you, but in my book ensuring that there's nobody able to fight you counts as winning.
---
See a Lasker video must upvote
---
You mix timelines and mechanics. There was the Phoebe-Patch that introduced Fatigue and lowered ranges of all jump-capable ships. After that you could not hold moons on the other side of lowsec, like PL or SC or others did for years before. If the attack message popped up they could just cyno over ther full map in 10 mins. That was gone with Phoebe. PL lost nearly all their lowsec R64 not within jump-/mid-range to their staging within a few months.
---
Well if you claimed all the alpha stuff and resub at the end, I think you get the omega stuff retroactively. Think that was written in a tooltip somewhere but not 100% sure.
---
It's not. What's wrong with offering people a path to upgrade their skills without waiting 5 years?
---
Thanks for the formula! Unfortunately it looks pretty weird to me. In game, you have 3 ship parameters (max speed, agility, mass), you manually set 4th (orbit distance) and then game decides what kind of speed you will have and how far you will actually orbit. So actual range and actual velocity should be the function of A, m, Vmax and orbit range you've set via UI. This formula doesn't have 2 different kinds of ranges in the 1st place, so I am confident it's wrong answer for this task.
---

I did that at the end of last year and it's nice not to have to worry about the health of the game. And I learned DIY car repair.

I never said I wasn’t having fun, ISRAD best Corp in game

CCP doesn't give a shit about highsec or its residents
---
This is very interesting and quite possibly useful! Thank you.
---
Honestly I'm sick to death of shit not changing because of fucking the sandbox and sand castles.
---
If something isnt fundamentally right then it's common sense to change it..
---
Like drag or warp disrupt bubbles.. like wtf... you want to use shit like that there are ships that do it...
---
Drag bubbles are just stupid full stop for example.
---
&gt; the consequences to the Phoebe changes was that PL etc spent more ISK creating dread caches and more alts across EVE, come on, 
---
- this is hearsay, you obviosly were not around when that happened
---
- also a dread cache would not help them as we had a few Supers and Titans too + our own dreads, and if their Supers were 1.5 days out of range (1st fatigue was much harder than now) we just dumpstered their Dreads ....

If you are an American who believes they were wrongly accused of racism, be sure you contact the diplomatic contacts "Victim of  Native American Genocide," "Slavery Wasn't That Bad," or "SchoolShootersDoNothingWrong 2ndAmendment" for more assistance from the EVE community.

---
Was absolutely insane. Went from any type of organization to fitting MJDs and warping to different wrecks at ranges and sending out bombers to cloak / decloak around the structure in between.   
---
Was a lot of fun though!
---
I agree with you that we should bring back gate sliding because it made for healthier, more accessible gameplay for new and veteran pvpers alike. The rest of your Lowsec / FW suggestions are basically just "CCP should ban the things I don't like," though.    
---
Instead of providing analysis for how your proposals would bring more players and more vibrant gameplay to the warzone, it sounds like you just want to make things easier for yourself.  No worrying about cloaked bad people waiting to gank you, no worrying about bigger groups with supers, no neutral structures to compete with, and btw don't make it so hard to win a system siege. It is fair to point out needlessly toilsome game mechanics, but I don't think turning FW into an easy-mode walled garden designed to drive all non-FW players from lowsec is the way to go.  
---
FW needs buffs to its core appeal, not nerfs to everyone else in lowsec.  It is tempting to blame Snuff, or random dicks camping a plex with a supers, for the oppressive status quo.  I sympathize, but I think they are a symptom, not the cause.  If they game provided more opportunities, there would be more growth to challenge the established powers.  Your proposal is akin to cutting down a large tree to prevent it from shading out the saplings underneath.  But I don't think the problem is actually Snuff (or others) casting too big a shadow, but that there isn't enough sunlight to begin with.
---
I never folllwed you in game, as CSM member or blogger. I feel like I should have done. We share the same perspectives of play style and overall agreement on the state of the game. We have similar perspectives of how CCP can develop a better product.
---
All the best, missing half-brother. For I won eve months ago and you soon will forget the game but not the people.
---
It's exactly like quitting a shitty job and finding a new one, but missing the people that kept you going.

---
I mean, its pretty obvious why isn't it? The realization that distribution could be used to create private eve 'classic' servers.
---
To expand on this, in order to build supers and Titans, you need the IHub upgrade for super capital construction.  You can only install this upgrade into an IHub, which requires sov null space.  (as I understand it)
---
It is too easy to avoid fights.  "Elite" pvp is basically flying a hard to catch ship and engaging only when you have the advantage.  Getting caught ratting or mining is basically a death sentence so you of course are going to gtfu and dock up. 
---
There needs to be a happy medium that keeps pve players on grid but also gives them a fighting chance rather than the current "if you get caught" you are dead meta.
---
Nullsec blocs don't fight very often compared to small or mid size alliances.  Removing asset safety would not incentivize conflict because the comparative value of looting a structure is much less than the big blocs would care about, when they can just krab
---
*5% of all bans in the top 25 alliances
---
Let's not forget that TEST has allied themselves with XIX and RED, two of the largest historical botters in the game, and have known for years that Wings Wanderers and KWG were botting under their watch but did nothing.
---
But who cares about that, it's all about the evil Chinese botting empire lma0
---
I agree with everything you say expect nerfing mining, not entirely sure how the combo of injectors+afk rorq armies is not a problem. Mining needs to be hella nerfed, excavators were a mistake. The old method of skiffs and retrievers was fine and I do not want to nerf them, but rorqs fucked this game. 
---
Other than that 10/10 agree with you.
---
Yes because I said "I take offense to this" completely seriously :P Retard being the one who can't notice an obvious joke slapping him in the face.
---
\^ That.
---
"remove sand from the box" I dont even know what this means and many of the items on your list really have been bad for eve.
---
I mean, it would be nice to know how well a keres at 70km can damp out a rapier. Currently putting the keres under "projected" for a rapier it shows you the status of the keres being at 0km. If there was a right click menu for the fit that had distance, that would be great.
---
So you would have your Rapier open in Pyfa, goto Projected, add a premade Keres fit and set distance to 50km, see how strong the damps are working, then set the distance to 100 and see how much weaker the damps are.
---
I have zero clue as to how any of what you do works, so im sure im making it sound super easy, even though it is probably really hard to do.
---
just because some entities see an opportunity in securing a fresh meat shield does not mean they care, simply looking out of themselves...
---
This was the inevitable conclusion of eve online.  Pack it up guys, the circle is complete.
---
What bothers me is that, per Jester, the sandbox has been shrunk, CCP actively interferes with the market, consumption is down, and the player base is stagnant.
---
I know I'm late to the party, but I just wanted to say thanks for a really interesting AMA and best of luck for the future.
---
Having won eve myself about the same time you were on the CSM, this thread has shed a lot of light onto how things were working behind the scenes at the time. It's a shame to know that this is where we are - I've always loved the idea of what Eve could have been, more so perhaps than what it actually was.
---
I'm not sure we ever crossed paths in game, but it was a pleasure sharing the Eve blogosphere with you for a few years. You were certainly one of the good ones. Fly safe!
---
Are there videos of people doing this? I have been winning eve for a while now, but that seems like it would take lockstep coordination or court disaster. IF thats the case then it seems like a cool option available to skilled groups. If its easy enough that 30 random line members can do it off the cuff then yeah thats OP.
---
&gt;Jesus features and lore, iteration and direction. Where are the Drifters? What's going on with the Sansha? Why the hell am I still seeing THE SAME MISSIONS I WAS COMPLETING IN 2012?! The game is a hodgepodge of wildly outdated features, things that have not been iterated upon in half a decade, and shiny new stuff, and it all feels like CCP has no clue where it's going.
---
This is the big one for me. EVE has a unique appeal that has kept me coming back more than any other MMO over the years,  but it is crazy how outdated features like missions are left to drag down other features in the game.  CCP should make pruning the dead wood a major priority.
---
Why is GOTG not in this picture?
---
&gt;all the moons everywhere are the same
---
Nope.  There are still materials that are not available in all areas of the game.
---
Waaa, people are using game mechanics that make my game play harder, waaaaa, ccp needs to change the meta to fit my play style
---
Its "Counting" ;-P ... I just COUNTED the accounts logged in around 2013 (after Phoebe Patch) when EVE Meta was at its healthiest point, small local conflicts in Lowsec were thriving over moons without big Bullies jumping on top of every fielded Capital and the average number of accounts per player was at 1.3 accounts. 
---
The Saturday EU prime level at that time was 50k to 65k LOGGED IN actually. Check it now, it is hardly reaching 40k on average Weekends (working days at 25k or so ^^). Then take into account how many people run Mining-Multiboxes with 10 Accounts or more, or even skillfarms with peak 180 accounts I witnessed. you can clearly say that the avg. accounts per player are above 2.0 now .... the rest of the math you can do yourself, leaving office now o7
---
I guess if SC will ever finish a lot of players will go there when EVE dies. I guess it will be the closest you can get at that point. On the other hand even tho a lot of players have concernes and issues with EVE there is nothing like it so leaving it for something else will be hard. Sure a lot of players quit hell since this game was released a lot of players went from a being student with too much time on their hands to having a full time job and family that alone is probably a reason for a lot of them. For now I don't see this game being dead anytime soon tho unless there is a new game that has the same appeal EVE does.
---
I agree with you OP, skill injectors are broken and dumb; however, what really puzzles me about this is how homeboy got that sec status in 9 days.
---
Let's be honest, as long as CCP is headquartered in Iceland, they'll never learn from mistakes, simply because the powers at be will never admit to them and step down...
---
So from now on skill farming will be mostly profitless until almost everyone stops skill farming, then it will be profit again until everyone starts skillfarming again and so on?
---
You *are*, however, allowed to blame them when they complain about the logical conclusions of their self-interested behaviour, but still refuse to change to more flawed behaviours that are arguably more beneficial and satisfying.
---
&gt; heard they were made to hold more than they take up in order to encourage their use.  Something about having items in the containers took load off their database server or something.
---
I mean, isn't this why freight containers exist?
---
It's a problem when TZ tank and instant system cyno jammers make your sand castle made of stone. Maybe a nerf there?
---
That always existed before by buying characters. The difference was that if the meta shifts, EVERYONE in EVE can immediately train into whatever that meta shift is. It makes it so that there is little to no comparative advantage whatsoever. Before skill injectors, you had to accept that some characters that were trained had more inherent value than another because it was trained for something you wanted. Nowadays, you get the same exact value of training fc5 and then extracting it as you do training caldari frigate 5 on a skill farm.
---
I’d say that for boosh fleets to work you need some skilled FCs, and a hundred line members or so with the inteeligence of either a trained doggo or a Chimpanzee
---
if you want to learn how to pvp solo, fw is the best option imo.  you will learn how/when to engage, tactics, etc much faster by doing it.  mostly frig pvp so its cheap when you have losses.  remember fw does affect standing so if you go min/gal you will lose access to jita/amarr hubs.  this can be circumvented with alts of course.  you can make plenty of isk to keep pvp rolling orbiting the button.
---
rvb i have no experience with so cant comment on them.  they been around forever so they do something right i guess.
---
both - not sure you can join rvb and fw at same time.  can pirate in low sec fw zones i guess.
---
there are a ridiculous amount of activities in eve.  you can bounce wh's, pirate, war decs (ikr), abyssals, etc.  you can turn pretty much everything into a way to pvp if you are creative.  eve is a sandbox...you create your own landscape.
---
I know, I just made a bad attempt at sarcasm. I meant that there was no way SP farms would not be profitable, so people would 100% abuse them, decreasing the value/meaning of SPs. But hey, every SP farm character brings like $40 to CCP in plex/MCT and extractors, so there's that.
---
Theres a few fleet comps based on, mainly The Initiative that did it first and best. The basic principle is you get lightly tanked by extremely long range ships, when in danger they can just take 2 or 3 booshes from their large wing of Command Destroyers (each boosh moves you 100km, its just an AOE micro jump drive). They're mainly used to contest citadel timers when outgunned. 300km range Cruise Ravens have been the usual suspects, but Rokhs, Eagles have also been tried. Stukas are using the same principle, but with tanked AB bombers with the booshing as a means of getting in range to shoot/bomb the target and always be close enough to sig tank.
---
\&gt; Damn, how did we do that over a decade before. 
---
You kept the vast majority of your stuff in an indestructible station or outpost.  Where you'd own the stuff even after your most hated enemy conquered it.
---
"But I need loot drops!!" was, oddly enough, never an objection to this system.
---
Being like the other CFC SIGs where their content is small gang pvp.
---
Well he's running 0.0 sites 24/7 basically
---
Thats a good way to prevent new customers unless you support RMT on ebay?
---
What was the question even? All I got was "...more media appearance."
---
I agree With Pretty much all the suggestions, Eve needs some Extreme change no matter how uncomfortable it would be at first, players would benefit from it in the long haul.
---
I've didn't make any statements about highsec trading citadels in my post.
---
Though they did give us some fun, capless brawls.
---
&gt; Urg, but I like Citadels and Skill Injectors. I only think Citadels are a little too hard to take down and need abit of a nerf but I love the concept of them.
---
I think you'll find thats how almost everyone feels about them. The issue is the details of their reinforcement/defensive mechanics, not the concept as a whole.
---
I was softly in favour of injectors when they first came out, but they've had a pretty horrific effect. While you call it catching up, the reality is there's an entire wealth of mid-scale gameplay you've missed out. Not because you necessarily bought your way to the end, because even if you didn't a critical mass of other people did. This also creates a horrible pressure to grind that was pleasantly absent in EVE compared to other MMOs.
---
I would be very entertained to see a towable type thing. Restricts players to gates while towing.
---
Yeah it was always explicitly fine, but people bitched about it all the time to the point where every thread complaining about someone multi-boxing would go on for pages of people calling them a hacker and saying they need banned, until finally someone would reference the blue post that explicitly said it was fine. Even input broadcasting was fine. They did apparently make a change to how it worked in the most recent expansion by disabling /follow while having war mode on, which pretty much effectively kills the five shaman running around one shotting people in world pvp stuff.
---
I multiboxed back in I think TBC for a while as a change of pace. It was a fun challenge and way harder than most babies whining about it would think.
---
It’s a shame we don’t use corp pings! Nice try on the spin though ;)
---
I think I made it very clear that the post mainly focused on my pet peeves, so yeah a lot of what you say is 100% fair. 
---
That being said, the preponderance of supers has a severe stifling effect on the game atmosphere, and the metaphor of cutting down a large tree to prevent it from shading out the saplings underneath is a good one. As someone who dabbles in ecology, the idea of doing a [controlled burn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_burn) to stimulate smaller-group growth is actually incredibly appealing to me. I am not sure what the "not enough sunlight to begin with" analogy is supposed to mean. The game provides many, many opportunities, but large groups have a disproportionately large ability to stifle those opportunities: you don't own a good moon in Gal/Cal LS without Snuff's permission; you don't make Titans or Supers without some sort of deal with one of the mega-blocs; you don't field rorquals unless you have a super umbrella or you can afford to lose 7b ISK easily. Again, positive feedback loop.
---
&gt; "remove sand from the box" I dont even know what this means and many of the items on your list really have been bad for eve.
---
He’s using that phrase to defend his weak arguments against changing the game.
---
Nothing is off limits to change if it improves the game experience. I believe removing local would be a good change because by its very nature, local doesn’t allow sand to exist there. Perfect intel that is also instant. No trackers needed. Crabs are relatively safe. No need for ships to protect them as the best protection is to be safed up as soon as someone enters the system.
---
What a wholesome interaction
---
I'm gonna need some sperg up in this comment chain asap
---
lack of content drivers. People/bots just dock up and theres nothing you can really do to punish them for it. Too many timers to realistically make them care, everything is on grid with a citadel, so they'll just turtle up in their citadel and tackle/kill/DD you if you try to do anything. The ESS is gamed to hell and when you do happen to find one in space, they're just in full spawned anoms/burner missions. Just feels like there is nothing to fight over in small scale/large scale conflicts. Timers everywhere.   
---
I remember the fun days, when you could simply sit on their station undock at 100 and get people to undock and try to shoot you with a tornado or some other ship and it would start a fight. Now you sit at 100km from a citadel and the people inside risk nothing to make you leave grid, or just go afk and no fighting happens in a primarily pvp game. Jump gates are on citadel grids and so are cyno beacons, so you're under the same issue where you can't shoot them to force an undock as they'll just use the citadel. Or if someone jumps through a gate, no matter how many points/bubbles/scrams you have, they can just slowboat back through the gate and jump back out. Then actually trying to reinforce a gate takes an eternity, while its still on a citadel grid that can be defended easily. 
---
Just tons of stupid mechanics that don't generate fights and remove risk while benefiting defenders with no incentive for attackers.
---
Can i get some downvotes please?
---
&gt; ...none of the following ideas are new or helpful:
---
&gt; * Ban capitals from lowsec
---
&gt; * Ban cynos from lowsec
---
&gt; * Ban citadels in facwar
---
&gt; * Ban neutral citadels in facwar
---
&gt; * Ban neutrals in facwar
---
&gt; ...they all have the same problem: They remove sand from the box
---
Bullshit. Can you honestly, seriously look at the state of faction warfare and tell me that there's more sand in the box there now than there was a few years ago? The various additions to the game over that period have not added sand to the box, they've broken a hole in the side and let the sand out. You are making the incorrect assumption that adding something is automatically an addition of sand, and that removing something is automatically a removal of sand. Neither of those is true. Sometimes something has to be limited or curtailed so that the sandbox can actually be played in. I'm not necessarily saying that those *particular* things need to be done, but you cannot blanket dismiss everything you don't like with an appeal to the sandbox.

1.Join Minmatar or Amarr FW - dont worry about not having a trade hub nearby.
---
Go here:  [https://red-frog.org/](https://red-frog.org/) 
---
Buy your ships in Jita in bulk and pay them no more than 20-30 mil isk per shipment (max value 1.5 bil) - regardless of how many ships - though there is a huge volume limit - but you can do like 100 frigs and still not reach that limit.
---
Get them to haul your ships + fits from Jita to Osoggur if you join Minmatar FW - nearest highsec to lowsec (1jump only)
---
Or get them to haul your ships + fits from Jita to Gammel if you join Amarr FW - nearest highsec to lowsec fw area(1 jump only).
---
As a casual player with busy real life, the LAST thing you want to do is waste time flying back and forth between market system and lowsec area - you want ships as close as possible so you can quickly refit and maximise the fun when you can play.
---
Red Frog freight do deliver to lowsec also through their Black frog division but it will be like 250-300 mil prob for a shipment - not worth it in my opinion.
---
TIP
---
When docked in the station that you choose as your HQ right click the station name on the top left area of your screen under system name and click "set home station" - this way when you get podded you get sent back to your hq station, reship and out you go again.
---
2.Honestly you can try RVB but is not the RVB of old - corp chat does not tend to have more than 5-10 pilots logged in at the same time for each of the corps. They do gangs  at set times but flying into the other corps HQ you cant even find anyone to have a fight with most days. I feel they are more about the  You could make your own mind up.
---
4. Join a corp like this:  [https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98407038/](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98407038/) 
---
Really active around fw minmatar, amarr area - they are minmatar fw corp btw. You will have fun with them.
---
Back then people were very careful with their accounts and turning them into bots as time took quite a while to get into a bot carrier. You got caught you could feel the burn.
---
there used to be a group i thought was against botting, their leader used to make daily posts about bots
---
then that group has joined what, by all available data, appears to be the first or second worst botters currently in the game
---
and now instead of condemning botters it seems their only defense is "well see, some other alliance has allies who used to be bots and might still be, we don't have data on that but probably, right!?, their are also other alliances near them that bot!!"
---
It's the WoW Shell Game business model. You have to constantly buff/nerf across classes and tiers to force the player-base into shifting skills by standard skillpoint accumulation or, hopefully by skill-trading (negative return on SP, ISK sink), and requiring active Omega accounts to do either. Same reason why the split ship skills, the only reason Triglavian ships exist. There will me more new races with the same mechanics, just presented differently, to add more and more skills to the game and requiring players to spend months and months of more skilling.
---
It will all come around sooner or later. But just know that balance is not their goal, regardless of what they say. IMBALANCE is the business model.
---
He is right there, upon my return to game I left fw and suddenly I got double the targets to shoot at - but then the downside is that you will start quickly losing sec status if you engage everyone which limits your ability to travel around somewhat. Or at least makes things more annoying.
---
Makes sense, who would have thought
---
POS code I hear
---
You are wrong.
---
They seem to be back in the alliance.
---
&gt;You are, however, allowed to blame them when they complain about the logical conclusions of their self-interested behaviour
---
No you're not, if I realize that a system is broken and I break it, I'm 100% allowed to say "i told you so, don't make a shitty system"
---
&gt;but still refuse to change to more flawed behaviours that are arguably more beneficial and satisfying.
---
It's, by definition, more satisfying to them, because they do it.
---
You cannot build supers or titans in wormholes.... it's literally not possible, regardless of structures used or how much crap you haul in (or mine) in there.
---
I claimed only one day!
---
Which has nothing to do with the asset safety point.  That in fact sounds more like the issue then is capital proliferation and the strength of them against sub caps rather than The poses themselves.  Passive income gathering may have been a mechanic to fill the coffers of the alliance leaders but ultimately still lead towards "big bullies."  and the fact that it is more active now with the current citadels puts more of the pie as it were towards the line members.  I will say that I think citadels need to be easier to destroy (maybe less time or timers?)  But I still disagree that posses were better or that they were the reason for driving more conflict (Or that couldnt be solved with lowering timers on citadels or some such.)  I remember Phoebe and before myself and I remember the complaints and witnessed the pain of grinding down SBUs and Outposts and it was MORE of a pain than it is now.  Citadels with the exception of possibly the Keepstar are far better than those mechanics and far better than Pos mechanics.
---

I had my stuff in POS Hangars for years, even my last Supercapital. Lowsec POS with XL-SMA. When I would go offline deliberately for longer than 1 or 2 weeks, I put my stuff to an NPC-Station. Still I gave people the chance to loot my stuff from POS when I was playing actively.

Also ift it was a player controlled outpost, you would have to infiltrate the new owner to get your stuff or firesale it to the new owners. 
---
My problem is that there was something you could loot and thus had an incentive to even deal with it (POS) They got replaced by something that you can only loot in WHs (WHY?) and elsewhere it teleports to safety magically. The NPC-Stations didnt even get touched by the whole story. 
---
The fact is that there were safe NPC-Stations and not so safe player owned Station (POS), you had to make assessments if you want to trade safety of NPC Station to more flexibility and the "Its Mine" feeling of a POS. Now there are still NPC-Stations, nothing changed with them, but the more risky variation where you had to use your brain for assessments is gone. Atm outside of W-Space we only have hello-kitty-secureness left now.
---
That would be awesome, iv played for about 5 years and that would be the coolest thing to see. what yalls ideas were for ships reasons and old mechanics listed in tips and tricks or something.
---
It's not and everyone knows it. They just argue against you because they don't want their rorquals kicked in.
---
&gt;Also I think reddit does a pretty bad job at advising newbros of where to go. The default answer to a newbro thread on here that seeks for advice is: Join Horde or Join Goonswarm.
---
The reason to direct new players to the mega-alliances is they have the resources to expose that new player to every aspect of the game.  And those alliances have an expert in every facet of the game who can teach that new player.  Which lets that new player find the parts of the game they really like.
---
So, go ahead and tell them to try one or more of the mega-alliances, but include that they need to re-evaluate once they've figured out what they really like in Eve.
---
Not possible in a wormhole. Need system sov.
---
Jeez what happened to EVE? As if the worth of skill points wasn't diminished enough by SP trading, they hand them out like candy too?
---
Ok literally lie on reddit lol
---
Fozzie sov was a mistake and is not fun.
---
Citadels were an ENORMOUS mistake.
---
ONE CORP!! ONE CORP!! I WILL HAVE YOU KNOW ESCALATED ARE A VALUED PART OF THE EFC, WE CONTRIBUTE JUST AS MUCH AS PROJECT AFK IF NOT A LITTLE BIT MORE!
---
What's our most recent ping then? I'm genuinely curious since it's been a while since I've logged in to discord
---
I see what you mean, essentially unbalancing the amount of players that can achieve high producing or high damaging gameplay versus before.  Essentially meaning that grinding is then the only way to get ahead by grinding more than the other people.  (Did I get that right?)
---
But even so that I still do not like to limit people solely based on the time to train, it was awful and I hated it alot. (ive got alot more I can do now in game since then.)  I believe that having to balance the production in the game with regards to everything being produced and destroyed rather than skill injectors being removed is the way to go.  having an avenue for people to quickly train into things to play more of the game I think is a good thing but that the game being unbalanced towards production currently is the issue ( and maybe towards defense as well).
---
Didn't even notice escalated LUL
---
I wouldn't share such opsec things on reddit ;)
---
&gt; But I still disagree that posses were better or that they were the reason for driving more conflict 
---
The more I read the more I get the conclusion you started playing quite late, otherwise you wouldnt make such statements. Or you are profiting very hard from Rorqual Moon Mining. Yes it did drive more conflict, yes it gave smalller pvp-focused groups a way of staying independant while still creating income (without having to watch netflix while your Rorq-Toons afk away ...
---
Right, because that'd totally out you lol
---
You do you, little bean
---
Think you mistook the winmatar ships to be amarr
---
All good points, I guess you just have to put up with the terrible scan res and accept that a nag will lock things slightly faster than you do.
---
Industry is a huge part of the game. They should have better events, but it seems the most outspoken "fans" want to delete everything not PvP related it seems
---
Thanks man
---
I'm in PH, should i feel concerned about this?
---
I care for the wellbeing of the corps I spy on ;)
---
If that something didn't involve being in a ship with more tank than a fax, more dps than some battleships, links, jump drive and a magical invulnerability button..
---
All the while sitting within range of a structure that can murderzone unsupported ships, offer instant safety when warped to and reshipping ..
---
Yeah, then I might agree.
---
You're wrong on all accounts in this post.
---
Cycles baby. Everything moves in cycles. Tide, body temp, circadian rhythm, menstrual cycle etc etc
---
Why anyone would think that price would move in a linear fashion? Everything humans touch and do follows cycles so our "constructs" by their very nature must also follow cycles.
---
what you mean?.... minmatar are rusty ducketaped pieces of scrapmetal loool (they may be good but...) they are UGLY!
---
&gt;Implying that our autism is worth spying on
---
This is true - forgive the generalization.
---
The reality, however, as I'm sure you're aware, is that none of those resources is so narrowly available, or so strictly controlled, or sufficiently valuable, as to provide the level of profitability and incentive for conquest that Dyspro/Prom, and Tech at one point, did. There were certainly issues with resource distribution, but that unevenness of the terrain - making some space better than others - was a critical conflict driver in nullsec. You coveted what your neighbor had. Now? Meh, I can have ~99% of what he has once I get the upgrades installed. Why bother?
---
Ironically, The Spire Campaign was going better before Liberty Squad Deployed.
---
Unspoken did far more damage than Liberty ever could. However, Liberty's deployment and smugposting about blobbing renters wjth 200 man eagle fleets backfired on them, resulting in NC. deploying to the AO. Since that time, Liberty has won what, 3 fights in 6 weeks? Cainun struggles to get 100 in fleet now.
---
Had Liberty Squad not smugposted so hard, we probably would have just left after we sniped the SAH Faction Fort back in March and not come back. Similar to pgl in the the TAPI Oijanen deployment, Cainun's focus on his ego and posting, instead of actually winning, has negated any gains from their deployment.
---
What a meme.
---
Bad people who don't want to be shown to be bad. Same thing happens in any mmo with damage/healing meters. People rail against them because they don't want to be outed. (and some people go overboard linking them to brag, but you just ignore those people cause they're dumb)
---
this subreddit is locked in a tragic cycle, players forced to play in a hapless way due to the unwillingness of CCP to innovate while asking for innovation on reddit.
---
As far as I can remember it has been 485. I have had a long break from Eve so could have changed?
---
Recently there was a sale for PLEX where it only cost 475 plex to run Omega instead of 500. Could this be what you thought about? &lt;- this is a subject for tomorrow I think.
---
SNI is such an underrated ship with its insane tank, my fit is pretty similar to that, though I run cruise over RHML (application isn’t great, but the reload *really* sucks, especially when you are running on 3200s) and I run 1 Adaptive + a Shield Boost Amp.
---
I do need to try out the new Mixed DPS + tracking BCUs to see if they help much with the cruises, even if I love 20-30 potential DPS I may be able to make that up by being able to apply well to cruisers and BCs...
---
Also CCPlease Scan Res buff, it’s too damn low.
---
Noob!
---
BUT PEOPLE WARP OUT when you come into local! 
---
Person A has ratting alt in random Delve system, person A is also logged into a PVP alt in random Malpais system. 
---
Person B has ratting alt in random Malpais system, person B is also logged into a PVP alt in random Delve system. 
---
The ratting alt of person A is visited by person B's PVP alt, so person A warps his ratting alt to safety. At the same the ratting alt of person B is visited by person A's PVP alt, so person B warps his ratting alt to safety. 
---
who are these 15 cretins who downvoted me? Are they even sentient beings?!
---
They better, it's funding the next failed game, and the one after that and so on.
---
I'd argue the way to fix it is to make the diminishing returns from injectors far worse.
---
They are extremely valuable for retaining new players, since those new players won't feel like they are hopelessly behind those that have been playing for several years.
---
But it would also be better if old characters couldn't use injectors so much, so choices go back to being more deliberate.
---
So, make the diminishing returns ramp up far faster, and to a far worse endpoint.  So injecting a new character straight into a Rorqual requires ludicrous money, but injecting into "can fly a handful of mainline ships in a fleet" is still practical.
---
Literally worse than a dread. I have never done anything with solo Cruise missles, but the idea is interesting.
---
How did you know! Who talked! Our security was supposed to be impenetrable! 
---
Though we're licking our wounds, were working hard to find some way to disrupt those burner missions, given that it's paramount to destabilising Pandemic Hoarde, which is our sacred goal and duty.
---
I was camping over the weekend, knew I’d miss more than 2 days, so haven’t bothered with logging in at all. Oh well. 
---
Other games put the big reward 75% of the way in, which gives incentive to log on without feeling like a burdensome chore plus lets the dedicated folks get some extra shiny stuff.
---
No I am not, I actually know what I am talking about. 
---
I totally doubt you do? How many R64 you have taken from groups like PL or Goons or NC. in Lowsec. How many big bully Supercapitals and Titans you have ganked from big bois?
---
My bet on all for you is ZERO ...
---
I think i will first start doing FW so i can farm some LP inbetween fights for money, and get more familiar with game first, but pirate life is something i also want to try sooner or later. Maybe we will see soon ingame :)

If you don’t like the results of your actions within a system, *your actions and the system itself are both valid points of change*. 
---
Besides, they *don’t* find the way they’re playing more satisfying. They *don’t* want to play EVE the way they’re playing it. I think they all know it, too. Give them more credit, they’re smarter than you think.
---
It’s a matter of *conflicted* desires: the desires for security and wealth, namely, outweighing the desire for fun and competitive content, because that content involves putting security and wealth at risk.
---
If people don’t want to change, well, I suppose that *is* fine. 
---
*They have the opportunity to change, however, and their awareness of that fact adds a level of self-hatred into the negative emotions they feel toward the stagnant environment, which will inevitably be loosed at CCP or other players, because accepting fault and blame for oneself is the hardest thing a person can do.*
---
Yeah way better
---
The funny thing is, I could have told them this would happen - we constantly have problems with availability statuses on our XMPP server, and it's a real pain to fix for our couple hundred users who don't change groups every couple seconds...
---
Total lack of conflict drivers in all levels of space.
---
Sometimes this does happen, smaller groups fight it out in backwater regions and it's a blast, for a while.
---
Then larger entities get wind and say "Hey that would be fun to wreck!" and they go murder all that fun which was occurring until none is left and then move on. 
---
Two recent examples come to mind: 
---
Genesis was starting to hot up as Shoot First and White Sky were starting to duke it out ever moons in the local area. Small groups of caps were used but it was limited and by all accounts a lot of fun. PL got wind and decided to shit on any hope of White Sky fighting back by swinging fleet numbers and big toys around whilst claiming they just wanted 'good fights'. Shit fizzled out.
---
Solitude saw a small conflict between Cavemen and LSH. Same story of small fights over moons and regional control. BL got wind and started bringing fully formed muunin fleets to every timer, massively outnumbering their opponents while harping on about 'finding content'. Unsurprisingly, LSH couldn't fight back and shit fizzled out again.
---
Goons dominating one region is not all that different from Goons dominating three regions.  Theta is plenty big to cover that much space.
---
And the downside of less "free" space for other alliances mean those other alliances gotta merge or die, which reduces conflict.
---
&gt; If you don’t like the results of your actions within a system, your actions and the system itself are both valid points of change.
---
changing my action does not change the actions of everyone else, therefore changing my action has no effect on the totality of circumstance.
---
your entire point is irrelevant
---

Star Citizen will never be released let's kill the dream there income depended on permanent alpha status. 
---
I mean i do see eve slowly losing it spirit of being that hard game, and while right now it's truth there is nothing like it losses already are starting to matter less and less, the way i see eve dying is when it becomes just like any other mmo because at that point the unique spirit is gone.
---
+1 for "meatspace"
---
There are only two, maaaybe three alliances that have a shot at covering SRP for a supercapital brawl if things go south for them. Actually sourcing the hulls, on the other hand, is a much larger challenge, even post-rorquals online. 
---
If you want an example of the least-bloody possible scenario, then look at UALX. Since this was pre-fax nerf, and the battle started in USTZ, titans could only be killed by DD salvos and the fight could last no longer than 8 or 9 hours. Losses went upwards of a trillion isk (I will laugh in your face if you think more than 1 or 2 alliances are even close to having that much on hand at any given moment), hundreds of regular capitals, and more than a dozen titans for the losing side (again, I will laugh in your face if you think there are more than 1 or 2 alliances that can replace those hulls within 1-2 months). 
---
And that was by far *the least bloody possible scenario*, and it still was beyond all but 1 or 2 alliances to quickly SRP. Oh, and the knock-on effects of UALX outright won the war in the south, due to instantly and completely crippling the attackers' morale.
---
Oil tycoon whining global warming fake news.
---
You’re right, but that’s not relevant to my actual point; might want to go back and read the rest of the argument.
---
Lol illusion. Obviously you are not in a massive block. How far Intel gets reported. Your lucky bet is wormhole. If you are actually taking gates mostly your target ran. After your whole fleet just wasted time for doing 10 jumps. Besides that I can give you entire regions that are actually empty for most of certain time zone so you can literally autopilot thru their sov and come out alive. Tldr we have too much space so we don't content over each others space for resources.
---
Well.. the one-room introduction didn't really help. It isn't super exciting to be looked in a single room with literally nothing to do.
---
FW plexes are mostly fine atm.  The problem is no longer being able to gateslide and completely ignore anything on the accel gate.
---
Though, it would be nice to get the old greater plexes back.
---
To be fair, that doesn’t change the story. They were both hunted, and kicked.
---
disable fitting a cyno if you have an invuln fit. Would solve a LOT of issues
---
If you check in game they were removed yesterday and remain out of an alliance.
---
Well I am very sceptical about SC too but if EVE dies thats pretty much the only project I currently know about that might scratch that itch. And even without the meaning of loss in EVE there still isn't a sandbox universe like it out there. I don't see eve dieing in the next 2-3 years at least tho.
---
Hello thank you for your constructive answer. Especially homestation suggestions. I really apreciate this type of information, because i was looking for potential HQs when scoutin FW area, but was more looking at closeby trading hubs. This perspective at being closest to action seems better, once i get a stockpile of frigates.
---
I pretty mutch decided to join FW, first solo for a week or so (to farm some lp, skill up some frigating skills get more familiar with mechanics, loose some ships) and then ill look for a corporation. 
---
Still cant decide witch side to join tho :D
---
And if not everyone gets it. Then it’s an advantage. 
---
People are just downvoting because they hate the fact.
---
Yes you are incorrect.  You don't know what you're talking about.
---
meh the gold rush is over. nowdays only the bigest allianzes own most of nullsec . so much they give it to other renters, because they cant possible deffend that much space their own. also something something blue  **donought**.
---
Industry contains its own reward, and there is never a shortage of miners.
---
&gt;taking personal action will make you feel better about it
---
Ah yes, the 'do the right thing' versus 'do the best thing' argument.
---
if you were right, no one would do the best thing, by definition your argument is wrong and you can look to the real world for a billion examples of this including philosophy dating back thousands of years.
---
&gt;and since your actions inevitably affect others, you may inspire them to do the same.
---
people have been doing this since the game came out and have been wholly unsuccessful, so that's a no.
---
&gt;Philosophy is fine, but does not overrule psychology.
---
call it whatever you want, your ideas do not hold up to common sense
---
&gt;You’re right

they why type continued nonsense

Reports are still rolling in from sphere but initial reports indicate that fleet numbers for Cainun are down not due to whelps but due to anti american behavior. It has been reported he supports gun control, thinks NASCAR is stupid and eats his steak well done. These reports do not bold well with the true patriots that are in goonswarm that fly the eagle as a symbol of pride for their country

Go mining ... actually ... wait, you have to tab in ... NEAR2 just pinged ...

You can still sell em' for a nice penny
---
You are numerically and statistically illiterate, but yet you continue to spout off on shit you know nothing about.
---
You don't know what % of the permabanned accounts in the top 25 alliances make up the total % of permabanned accounts, but you presume to speak anyways on it.
---
You are saying that they are "the first or second worst botters in the game" but you have no proof of that. These are banned accounts that have been reported to CCP.
---
But perhaps the biggest and most disingenuous point of all: You are completely missing how the overwhelming propaganda war from TEST/Legacy hinges upon accusations of FRAT botting a lot. This is **IN SPITE** of the fact that TEST/Legacy directly support XIX/RED (i.e. the biggest historical RMT/bot alliances in the game) and have sheltered Wing's Wanderers and KWG for **years** knowing that they bot but not stopping to collect their rent checks.
---
I would have played the shit out of both. I actually didn't play eve at the time and hated console shooters, but since it came free with a ps3 I bought I tried it out and it seemed like it would've been good fun on PC, but I just couldn't put up with console controls. Definitely would have bought eve back then had Dust been on PC instead of waiting like 5 more years or something before finally giving it a try.

No, we'd have 20 man bomber fleets bombing said barges into oblivion. Bomber's bar existed and thrived long before rorqs.

The deal with mjfg is multi jumping an entire bs fleet ie ravens with no penalties. The problem is multi jumping in general because ships with slow aling time like bs and bombers don't have to worry about aligning because they blink instead of warp. And by the time you scan and warp to them they boosh again .
---
Little mad are ya?
---
"  I'd be thinking it's an issue with communications between the chat cluster and Eve " That's exactly what they blamed last time so if that's accurate it would not be new but yet another re-emergence of the same issue they have failed to solve for going on 15 months now.

&gt; Add passive income back
---
It is not gone, it has just been moved to trading citadels by removing one of the most reliable and important ISK-Sinks, trading taxes &amp; broker fees.
---
But as no ISK-Faucets were added I see no problem /s
---
But very old mechanics are more likely to be changed for current game balance than things like injectors that make CCP money.  Changing how Cyno work for instance.
---
Yeah a capital-level ship that specifically tied to one specific role in a very specific gameplay
---
Sounds EVE enough
---
Have you considered not being a part of one of the largest blue blobs in the game?
---
But was sov ever fun? I feel like that problem might be impossible to solve in a fun way. I choose not to take part in sov, either way.
---
And I agree, citadels were a mistake. In addition to the game mechanics side, I feel like they just dumb down EVE's landscape. Outposts were more interesting and significant, and POSes, as broken as they always were, had something very EVE about them.
---
I stepped away from my computer and remembered something more: the actual definition has something to do with whether it is an intermediate component.
---
So, actually, the PPPI is minerals and moongoo.  Looking at the index decomposition, reacted moongoo is in PPPI, not the SPPI.  PI and components are in the SPPI, on the other hand, as well as salvage... and character accessories????
---
Economic balance? Sure.
---
No. You bought characters using ISK. RMT was typically for ISK, although it did exist (Much as it does nowadays) for ships, accounts, characters, etc. In any case, it was a small consequence to making it so that meta shifts occurred at a normal, rational pace. Back before skill injectors I remember PL would have 6 month-1 year plans for the alliance, because that's how long it would take to properly get everyone skilled up into fleets of archons, or after that dreads when they got buffed. It made it so that if you detected something changing in the meta, and skilled for it as a group, you could have a decisive advantage over your opponents. Alot of the time, there simply wasn't enough characters for sale to properly fill demand. There used to be real consequences to making good or bad decisions with your character sheet. Now, there are no consequences.

You know what he needs?

&gt;The reality, however, as I'm sure you're aware, is that none of those resources is so narrowly available, or so strictly controlled, or sufficiently valuable, as to provide the level of profitability and incentive for conquest that Dyspro/Prom, and Tech at one point, did
---
There are moon materials we literally can not mine in the South of the map, and have to import from Jita.  Ditto for the North.  Those materials are far more available in their respective areas than the old system, which has lead to more being sold in Jita than before and a corresponding price drop.
---
But if Panfam wanted to take over the market for one or two goos, they still could.  It would require more cooperation with their allies than the old system.
---
We don't currently bother because 1) no one (currently) wants to put forth that much effort and 2) They need what we got too, so one embargo would spawn an equally-crippling counter-embargo.

Welcome!  The reson i suggest amarr or minmatar gw is becausr i feel that gallente is not enough action and caldari fw area is on the elite side. Expensive ships crashing ur party! As an alpha clone you will struggle. I mean be aware that as an alpha u will struggle anywhere really but u will have more fun in amarr/minnoe space. 
---
I goy back to game 2 months ago and got loads of fun fights in the bleak lands region of fw in the south.
---
Yes, but the dudes I run small gang with are happy running out of b0rt. Most of our blues are outside USTZ. The only content we'd get for dropping a current ally would be to reset brave for a content preserve. Which I'd love to do lol.

Legacy code^TM

If he was trolling us he either has a huge need for attention himself or he's a pro troll... either way local was getting a laugh at him for 4 hours and I don't mind being METAtrolled for that good laugh.

Could be said about everything in EVE. Killing events isn't going to help the game any. Just need better more engaging events. Low level industry is super accessible to new players so it's an important niche still

But you see.... it wasn't a 7M Rifter. What you aren't understanding is THERE'S A DIFFERENCE SIR!!! (No I have no clue the difference but this guy apparently knew of one)

Ship balance? Sure.

Ram Ranch for the big boy!
---
Been playing since 2005 with no major breaks so i kinda saw it and lived it all. What bothers me the most is that i simply don't understand why am i still playing this game. I really hate eve's current state and i really want to quit. i take 2-3 days break and then log back in. I log in and do nothing i swear. Simply stay in and watch some ships in the station and log off again. That is most of my daily gameplay. What the actual fuck keeps be logging back in this broken game. I have no clue tbh.  That is what bothers me the most. Talking about what is broken or bad about the game is pointless. Mostly everything!
---
Thats what I did, way back when. Kinda miss our best of [Cobalt.Intel](https://Cobalt.Intel) :D
---
As I said, i don't know that it is dead. It just feels that way as I pass through it. I am sure that a local would find fights, but I stopped living in lowsec 6 years ago, and now it just feels silent and empty. There was a time when I would scan my ls static, pop in and be instaganked on the other side. Never happens anymore. Go figure.
---
We all did... after 4 hours in local I think I lost my high school diploma worth of brain cells.
---
Such rage, so wow, very melt down.
---
Oh, fuck off, I know as well as anyone that nobody’s gonna listen to me. Makes me an idiot, but it doesn’t make me wrong or nonsensical. 
---
My point is that people can change the system by defying their self-interests (which lead to the secure, docile actions that bore them), and taking *specific* idiotic actions that will ultimately be more entertaining in the long run, because those actions will perpetuate the cycles and activities that are the source of the joy those people find in EVE.
---
I don’t expect anyone to *actually do that*; nobody cares about the long-term, they just want to be less bored *now*.
---
I don't like PVP. I like PVE. Still feeling my way into the game. Played one month in 2014. Came back couple of weeks ago. I want to explore the Eve universe, not fight people in it. I want to fight drones. I want to explore anomalies and all those unknown factions. I want to build things. I don't want to destroy anyone's livelihood or ships.
---
Perhaps there are more people like me now.
---
"You consent to PVP when you undock". Perhaps even this slogan will be gone with the passage of time. I for one will approve.
---
What GOTB did to your alliance and the whole narrative behind it was retarded, all the best in the future dude.
---
I'm really sure it use to be considerably cheaper. Like when plex was around 1.5 bil to plex an account, mctc stuff was around 1.2
---
Alright!
---
Thx thats actually really useful information!
---
Cheers
---
Thanks.
---
Aye thanks for correcting me
---
I've flown in one of these fleets myself, with, eh; about a third of high-class wormhole space?  We were shooting structures in Holesale's home, so they have lots of enemies.  It takes a solid amount of coordination, but execution was easier than I expected from when the idea was first floated.  You do kinda need two or three people working in concert to direct the fleet, though, just because the cognitive load is so high.
---
There are a couple of AARs floating around from using this fleet, but Capri covered most of it.
---
Aye thanks for correcting me. I see you feel the same pain.
---
Is it that great? How do I get there? Null sec is 0.0 and below that, right? I am sure I will get destroyed many times on the way to that. What is PH? I've only heard of goon squad or something.
---
&gt;Also ift it was a player controlled outpost, you would have to infiltrate the new owner to get your stuff or firesale it to the new owners.
---
There's these things called "courier contracts".  And a lot of ships heading towards Jita that would happily carry your stuff instead of heading there empty.  I did it several times.
---
&gt;My problem is that there was something you could loot 
---
And this is false.  99% of the population were not as "uphill, both ways" as you claim you were.
---
In the vast majority of cases, there was no loot in null except for the input materials on production POSes, and things like ammo from the guns.  And guess what?  Input materials drop from citadels, and their ammo drops too.
---
(This is your cue to claim that lowsec was a fantastic land of milk and honey, disregarding that the vast majority of lowsec players also only used NPC stations)
---
The claim that the loss of loot is what's stopping you is false, because there was no loot.
---
Thing that bothers me most, is the lack of people in EVE Radio chat channel. They are my only in-game friends, and i wish there were more of them
---
Otherwise, the game is fine, but that comes from someone who is playing for the last couple months :)
---
I like both :)  Though Fozzie sov admittedly does feel janky.
---
Pretty much!  Put enough people together, and a 2-minute cooldown is no object.
---
Nope.  Carry on as usual.
---
I'm not talking about you. Its along the same lines as what your post was about
---
When people complain about not having fun...well, go somewhere else then.
---
Anything that can run a C3 can do those easy. Actually probably safer. I used a laser legion.
---
&gt;I know as well as anyone that nobody’s gonna listen to me. Makes me an idiot, but it doesn’t make me wrong or nonsensical.
---
It makes you wrong if you change your life for futility
---
&gt; My point is that people can change the system by defying their self-interests
---
People will do what they want to do, and rarely if ever do things they don't want to do knowing it wont make a difference. People have tried what you're saying historically and in eve, it doesn't last, so you're wrong.
---
&gt; I don’t expect anyone to actually do that; nobody cares about the long-term, they just want to be less bored now.
---
People try, they fail, it never works because people always act in their own self interest, and shouldn't be expected to not act in their own self-interest, and shouldn't be blamed for acting in their own self interest, especially when the developers can change the system itself.
---

We still have moon fights ya know.

That's... depressing...

" Also, remember when you actually had to repair your structures? Yeah it was grindy, but it balanced with the offensive grind. "  I do actually miss this part, usually a harrowing time countdown till the enemy got there to stop you.
---
&gt; usly, story
---
Worse, a minnie slaver, too.
---
Oh, there's always a story, but the gist of it is that a corp that focused on recruiting newbies kicked a newbie for a dumb bs loss.
---
It's been the better part of a decade, was actively recruited by an Italian cva (or yulai? no clue) corp, krabbed a bit, decided to get a battleship, then wars were declared and something was said about evaccing assets, so I piled my few belongings in it and tried to get it back to hisec... through HED-GP. 
---
Classic newbie moment. In fairness, I was extremely unready for null.
---
Such a thing would never happen today, I think. Nowadays it's normal to laugh, send the victim 50 mil, and move on. But back in the day, people did care.
---
I was a new player when i started using them (less than a year old character). I was injecting skill to fly a rorqual (and some other stuff). 
---
I started playing. Went to youtube. Found videos about exploration. Spent 2 days watching all kinds of videos on exploration (playing them in the background) in order to learn everything i could. I spent 16 or 17 days casually exploring wormholes, and i made about 1.5 bil isk from selling exploration loot. I then bought myself omega status and joined Goons. 
---
I quickly learned that 1dq was the best market in eve, so i used various tool that showed what people brought to 1dq from Jita and were selling it at a mark up. 
---
I started buying things in jita and selling them in 1dq. 
---
I made billions with 4 months or so. 
---
I started buying other things, such as ice, made even more billions. 
---
I started injecting things like Rorq skills, because i could. 
---
Its easy, all you gotta do is talk to people and listen to advice.
---
Karma roulette
---
100% agreed.
---
Any properly fit BC, T2 or Faction cruiser should be able to clear them. Hardest imo is the ordinary? *the one that spawns 5 sentries* you need like 50km range to run it well.
---
Oh yeah. I cannot immagine how it all looks from a new player's perspective, in 2019. Those missions felt dated even back when I started.
---
[https://updates.eveonline.com/](https://updates.eveonline.com/)
---
The website offers rather nice highlights of what has changed over time. I am not kidding you.
---
It is more general than patch notes but more detailed than you may want. But reading these updates you will not miss important changes.
---
Panic should be removed.  A rorq is a capital ship and should be a dead ship if not escorted.  Fleet ops need to be brought back to life.
---
I guess the biggest question is "does Cainun eat bacon?"  He already sounds like a commie and if he doesn't eat bacon that would make him a **Commie Muslim**.  That's about as anti-american has you can get and *those eagles wouldn't leave the station*.
---
A game style CCP isn’t going to move toward, because they’re trying to boost player numbers by catering to individual players and massive alliances, which, *like self-interested player behaviour*, will lead to short-term gains, but long-term losses.
---
they tried focus groups im not sure why they stopped
---
Yet more proof that the economic warfare aspect of eve is dead.
---
Welcome content.  Thanks.
---
&gt;Getting caught ratting or mining is basically a death sentence
---
What year do you live in? My 8 man gang caught a ratting carrier yesterday. There were FAXes and supers on grid within half a minute. Hell, we don't even touch rorqs, because 1 semi-afk dude is completely safe from a 10 man frigate gang. Mining and ratting are the safest that they've ever been. It used to be that people docked up, now they don't even bother docking.

---
I spent an ungodly number of hours chilling on comms while repping poses in an osprey. Kinda wish that you could rep citadels as they get shot, now. It would eliminate the need for damage caps.
---
Devs don't play the games they work on for a reason. It introduces bias, and exploitation. Devs are human-like and do make errors in judgment. Best to avoid the situation altogether.
---
IMO tethering is completely overpowered from a small-gang pvp perspective. And let's not even talk about gates and beacons. Bleh.
---
What about cataegories?
---
x positions for nullsec representatives 
---
x positions for lowsec representatives 
---
Etc.
---
Then have the people vote. This way each playstyle has a voice
---
You can have a sotiyo in a C3 but supercapital production requires sovereignty which means that it can only happen in nullsec.
---
Are you mad bro?
---
E:D is a joke too. Nothing but a trucking simulator in space (and this is coming from someone that bought into the beta). 
---
The worst part about it is the "offline" mode where you play in the "persistent online universe".... but with no other players (and hence no danger) around you, just predictable scripted NPCs. WTF?! And then, you can amass all the wealth you want, and join proper online mode, kill some noobs, and then go back to amass wealth in offline again while claiming that you "pvped"
---
Since beta, the devs have been keeping us (Eve-like) players at bay by promising "Ironman mode" (or whatever it was called). You weren't to be allowed to switch offline/online modes in Ironman, so at least all those people who *chose* to play Ironman would be on equal footing (i.e. they'd have to balance wealth-gathering vs risk)... But nope... they scrapped the feature.
---
And don't get me started on next-century space computers that didn't have enough memory to store the list of items for sale from the systems that I *have* visited just a few jumps ago.
---
You had to play with a pen and paper next to your joystick, pedals and headtracking gear..... like I said: trucking simulator in space, nothing more
---
Oh really? Who do you play with?
---
My main point is that there are way to many people that point the finger straight at CCP. Yes they fuck up but as players we need to take responsibility for our actions that affect the stagnation. We are autistic and created the boosh raven fleet doctrine lol, CCP could never have imagined that when they came out with command Dessie’s
---
Lul works without the cloak also eh.. Try fitting an orca with a 500mn. Same effect instawarp after the cycle.
---
&gt; 10 man frigate gang
---
there is your problem.  If you decide to roll around with kitey ass shit that can't kill things, then don't complain when you can't kill things?
---
but one guy at CCP can change the direction and ACTUALLY change the course they're on, meanwhile HUNDREDS of people here have tried and have failed.
---
Your assertion that acting out of your self interest would lead to long term satisfaction is wrong, you would need ALL players to agree to this which is more than unrealistic, it's impossible.
---
Trying to link Hilmar's vision for the game (or lack of vision) to this impossibility is stupid and to be honest fucking retarded.
---
Honestly it'd be nice if they extended the campaign by a day due to login issues over the weekend. Granted that was only a few hour window but still.
---
Yeah it's pretty silly and I've escaped some really dumb situations with it
---
VO recently
---
Or we can not have any content at all provided by the individual. Whatever floats your boat.

Want more sandbox in the box? Remove multiboxing.
---
Thats what they want us to think
---
Slyce is just great. I had little time with the alliance but I loved it. Lots of fun with the blops and weekend fleets. Sadly most of the fcs I had left to TEST or for some stupid reason joined Dorkness, but Slyce is still Slyce. My only complain was the SRP but nothing else. I wish you guys the best!
---
Don't let us bittervets get you down. I actually still log in every day, and I enjoy the game even when I'm just sorting stuff in my hangar, or reading ship stats. The dissatisfaction stems from a greater historical context, the things I unconsciously expected, unique experiences that I don't think I could repeat in this day and age. Game's still fun though.
---
Um, like Pearl Abyss where they can microtransaction it to hell?
---
I like your kicking over sandcastles metaphor
---
Yes BUT you cannot be probed down when you’re taking off so they cannot scan down you’re initial safe.
---
Nope. like 24km max unless you go officer webs.
---
Doesn't this contract all the PC players who were upset that CCP was marketing a PS3 game to a PC crowd?
---
Well then, I hope you have fun doing that. I know for sure that there aren't MORE players like you now. Hisec has always constituted the majority of the EVE playerbase. It's why hisec exists: to satisfy the needs of a certain type of player. Nullsec, lowsec and wormholes exist for the same reason, with my kind of player in mind. Null security.
---
I was running from a dude in a shattered hole and he kept dropping combat probs every time I would warp.  Did the cloak warp trick on accident thinking to make room away from his warp in and boom. Insta warp. Didn’t see probes on D-Scan. I think he missed me.
---
“One guy at CCP” can’t do a goddamn thing; see u/Jestertrek’s AMA yesterday for more insight into CCP shenanigans. You’re not wrong about my assertion, though.
---
As an aside, I wasn’t “trying to link” anything; just making a topical comparison.
---
HA HA
---
Or bring back the faction starbase charter mechanic for high sec.
---
It'd be a soft cap that requires active players to run missions for LP for charters, or otherwise grind isk from 3rd party mission runners who dump their charters on the market. Either case needs active players, the latter creating a new way to cash out LP, and both being an isk sink.
---
why the fuck everything cost isk
---
Deflection....noob defense.
---
Same. Gonna be real nice to skill into an Orca and start actually manufacturing stuff from my own ore!
---
&gt; “One guy at CCP” can’t do a goddamn thing
---
the ceo can, i literally fucking said hilmar too you inbred
---
HA
---
Your name sounds really familiar, for some reason. 
---
Just unistall it, dood. I did the same with WOT this winter after playing for 7 years, and I am better for it. Used to read the subreddit and follow various youtubers, now I see their videos in my feed and it takes me a moment to remember who they were.
---
 I think it's easier to let go when the temptation isn't there. Some people prefer to outright biomass, but I'm not capable, and in the times when I felt like I needed to let go of the game for a while, I just uninstalled and that helped me get it off my mind.
---
Yeah this smells like a business-end decision to me
---
Passive Drake, maybe?
---
Your last 3 posts are all variations of 'u mad bro?'
---
Maybe try another argument.
---
130 Titans. That's cute.
---
that is not typical at all, but most games don't have EVE's level of persistence and inter-connectivity.
---
lol k
---
Oooof
---
Yeah I don't want microtransactions introducing on a mass scale thanks
---
Yeah, CCP could make it entirely impossible to crit or roll holes, then the significant fraction of the playerbase which spends their time turtled in w-space behind mass limit with a purely parasitic relationship towards the remainder of the game wouldn't be able to roll and troll, rat in disconnected pockets while laughably spewing rancid bile on reddit about how they're the only ones accepting any risk... ahh, the dream.
---
Pardon, I'm kind of the loop when it comes to k-space entities. Who's that?
---
What sandbox, eve is already a theme park it's just lead by a couple of players the majority of folks ( me included ) don't really experience the sandbox. 
---
Like the loss meaning something is like the last thing eve has left, and well that has like a couple of years at best with the direction the economy is going.
---
I do it in a drake.
---
Devs probably don't play the game because when they do it reminds them of that shitty code they were refactoring all day that no one in the business can understand.
---
or this, yep
---
Vastly Outnumbered, Smaller Industry Alliance under ShootFirst, but we like to fight as well.
---
I mean, this is what you get when you only look at the numbers and don't actually play the game to understand the context of those numbers. A similar thing has been happening with balance in Team Fortress 2, where the people who develop the game don't actually play it and so don't understand it.
---
So you’re going to blame a game company for trying to encourage people to play their game with free stuff, and the only requirement to get the free stuff is to log in and click a button? K...
---
Now the question lies, can you do it in a super.
---
Security status of 5.0 in 9 days
---
Undetected, or does CCP even care?
---
&gt; There are only two, maaaybe three alliances that have a shot at covering SRP for a supercapital brawl if things go south for them. 
---
&gt; losses went upwards of a trillion isk (I will laugh in your face if you think more than 1 or 2 alliances are even close to having that much on hand at any given moment), hundreds of regular capitals, and more than a dozen titans (again, I will laugh in your face if you think there are more than 1 or 2 alliances that can replace those hulls within 1-2 months). 
---
you can laugh all you want, just shows how little you actually know. That 1 trillion number? that's half of what a kinda small corp from fucking moa had in its wallet. Yes corp, not alliance. in 90% of active nullsec alliances you can probably get a group of 10 guys(and that's highballing) that would be able to srp all that and still be fine, before factoring even alliance funds. You don't even need to offer srp for titans tbh, most titan owners can just replace their shit themselves.
---
&gt; Actually sourcing the hulls, on the other hand, is a much larger challenge even post-Rorquals Online. 
---
not really, yes odds are you won't get them instantly in huge numbers but give it a couple weeks and all the major players will have it, and the other won't take much longer. it's not like you need to replace them in such short order anyway, titan brawls happen twice a year if that, let alone titan brawls your titan will make a difference.
---
&gt;And that was by far the least bloody possible scenario
---
???????
---
&gt; Oh, and the knock-on effects of UALX outright won the war in the south, due to instantly and completely crippling the attackers' morale.
---
you really believe that don't you? what won the war on the south was doom dropping the crack pipe and actually reading up on citadel mechanics and understanding that offensive wars are irrelevant post citadels. It was an inevitability, differently from what sapporo loves to say they aren't gonna be evicted by anyone unless they want to leave. It was not morale that stopped that, it was common sense when you mix mechanics(which took him long enough to grasp tbh) and the willingness for goons to come.
---
Well being lead by others is a choice you make too. There are a lot of opertunities to be more than a number in a fleet.

Fixing the game would bring in far more users then a F2P style login reward ever would
---
Local was gone last year for like 2 days and almost no one played on those days. You would be down to maybe 5000 players all hunting in vain for the non existent krabs that have all left. Not everyone wants to play the game in ultra stress mode, constantly de-scanning just to get caught by a pilgrim and lose everything. If you want that, go to wormhole space and keep your retarded ideas to yourself
---
Oooh, I actually do know this name for some reason. Glad to know that you guys are still fighting over moons. I come from the perspective of a guy who has 0 mining skills and no alts, so the new moongoo is completely off the table for me.
---
I agree on all counts if I could get people to actually stay logged in for boring guard duty :/  and boy I've tried.
---
That ruins the fun of it though!
---
CCP: What? Do players want loot roulettes? ALRIGHT!
---
Did this really need to be posted 4 times?  Probably.
---
I agree, but at this point, with an aging game, a waning playerbase, and business cuts to the dev team, it’s a lot more of a playercount boost per  dev paycheck-dollar (unfortunately) to run promotions like this.
---
Sorry for being standoffish, I just dont see the point in getting annoyed over free items :)
---
All I could ever ask for is a big story driven mission(s) played out just like in these trailers. These trailers is what’s suppose to bring new bros in and when they do and don’t see the game play like the trailers then there’s a slim chance they’re going stick around.
---
This mission not being able to solo but having to be part of that faction and bloodline and multiple players involved and feeling like they’re in the lore as it’s being written.
---
Now most players right here will say this is what’s happening and it’s all player driven (as it should be). But the usual mission grind is getting boring, low sec PvP is some what ok but losing its novelty. Null sec is vast but there’s only industrial wars and nothing to really grasp new bros except to scare the few off.
---
Am I too far off by just saying CCPls give the huge story driven battles that takes our imagination to the next level. Faction vs faction not just blue vs red but rewarding and fresh for even the experience players?!
---
Aye, but alot of industry folks like the new way.  I do cause its more active and definitely gives line members more of the cut.  I think alot of people dont know how to monetize the new system well or to get also an industry arm to help out and the like.  I sincerely think it gets more people active in different parts of the game.
---
I like this game very much, since it's unique in every aspect i usually saw in MMOs. I know that for a veteran players some things are seen from a different angle and i understand and accept it.
---
I do like this community a lot, and i see the impact they made throughout the years. I'd like to see that more in a future, but for now I'm fine with some chatting strangers making cold space feel more welcoming :D

That’s already banned

---
Genuinely impressed and scared of UFC, was in one of the fight vs them. Out of nowhere. Gf.
---
I mean, that's not *necessarily* a bad thing. It keeps the meta shifting and changing rather than resulting in a stagnant game, and every time the meta changes it gives newer players the ability to catch up with older players easier *in theory*.
---
However, I will admit that Skill Injectors pretty much negate this in practice.
---
they can also fit mjds

Nice!

There really isn't for most players, you either need a existing fanbase you can draw on or you need some way to well get a role of importance in a existing group, and given the limited spot there are for decision making roles the fast majority of players end up with neither, now assuming i'm not special because i'm not it's more likely then not i ended up in the majority of players.
---
Heh I have no experience with them beyond watching the YouTube documentary on the Fountain War, and knowing that they killed BoB. 
---
I’m pretty new, trying to figure out my niche :)

remove launcher, ban players, limit one ship per account, nerf eve

got it
---
Beyond ratting aligned, the domi also facetanks instead of sig tanking so a lot of small stuff that is used to hunt cant break a domi like it can a vni.
---
Delete this
---
Did Morkt Drak or TomB still work at/for CCP in some form?
---
It's one of the best things that the Imperium has brought to the game as well, and I'm glad other groups have started to take on the idea.
---
Being able to match playstyles with people with relative ease is excellent for keeping people around and interested.
---
Been paying for them in a storage unit for the past 7 years. Needed to decide what I could afford to ship half way around the world and about 4 hours in which to do so. They didn't make the cut. However they will probably make it to eBay anyway as we took them down to a local recycling centre and an excited crowd gathered...
---
Yeah.  Same with station containers.
---
1. I agree. Lowsec is pretty dead. Dabbled in FW for a while and it was nothing but a bitter joke.
---
2. Small-gang PvP seems like the stuff of wormholes nowadays, there's still good fights without breaking the bank to be had in W-space. Not much in the way of ship variety, though.
---
3. I still got all these millions of SP in exhumer skills I've convinced myself will be useful someday again. Someday... ;\_;
---
4. Here's hoping they do something interesting with the Triglavians. Here's hoping. Not holding my breath, though.
---
Thats a fair point, easier to catch for gangs though, and a 2-3 AFs should be able to break a domi.
---
1200 members XD
---
good meme my friend
---
Correction: Get downvoted
---
  I think that a good solution to this would be to limit (Sorry OP) the amount of entities that can be booshed by the command dessie prioritized by range. Make it 5 as much. Keeps the functionality for small gangs, and you get rid of a cancerous fleet tactic... or at least more complicated to run. Also to make Olmeca cry.
---
very nice!
---
EM was saying you guys were not strong enough alone so they had to bring Pheonix into the fold. jus sayin
---
I honestly think there's a very high likelihood that you look like the 5th Teletubby IRL, I can't understand why you would be this eager for attention otherwise.
---
&gt;Doesn’t really work when we can read corp pings bud...
---
The only thing this sentence achieves is to provide solid proof to at least two corp rosters full of people that you are an utter mong.
---
Personally, they should buff T3C's by removing the skill point loss on death.
---
Lol im here using a double stabbed ishtar to facetank rats and baddies who come into my pocket oh no im not able to hold? warp out under your scram :p
---
&gt; Init even tried deploying a corp in Venal to disrupt BL.../Horde guristas burners
---
And also, I can project the bat signal out of my japseye.
---
Thing is, moons used to be one of the very few ways to make isk while being a pvp-only player. There's a number of folks in this game who just don't care about PVE, no matter what, and moons brought them together into active, fiercely combative groups. When we lost moons, we lost a playstyle, and probably a number of players, too. And along with them, a bunch of groups that used to make things happen. Oh well...
---
PS: that's gotta suck! Are you guys still offloading the stuff, or stockpiling while waiting for the market to recover? I've been krabbing in WH space for years now, and blue loot has a fixed isk price, so market fluctuations pass under my radar.
---
"you don't own a good moon in Gal/Cal LS without Snuff's permission" this is nothing new and has nothing to do with super fleets. Years before super/titan proliferation Snuff and SC used to control to an even more extreme degree with at least 80% of r32 and r64s in all of LS under their thumb. It used to be larger alliances held the 64/32s and smaller corps held the 16s and did reactions for their isk. The larger alliances didn't bat an eye at the smaller corps having POSs cause it doesn't affect their gameplay. Now, with forced mining larger alliances have to make sure that all the content in their mining region is squashed so their miners can mine in peace. This is exactly what many large LS alliance FCs/leadership said would happen back when the new mining changes were released by CCP. If you look at old arguments from Hy, the Waffles FC, the SC FC, myself, and many others you'll see what is happening right now is what we all warned would happen and we were told to STFU and adapt and that we just were sad we were losing our passive mining. Even right now if you look at the minnie/amarr region the good moons are held by SG/SF to the same extent SNUFF does. IMHO Cits are the biggest issue to LS (outside of FW needing a buff) but I did enjoy your write up, it was well thought out.
---
Also pirate faction space seems like a good place for rats to go.
---
They used to haze drones pretty fast if you were afk, people bitched
---
I mean, if you played instead of just trying to emulate a bot...
---
Or they'll just get more expensive, because the plex price will rise a bit again.
---
If you don't get the response you want, just keep putting it up until you do!
---
WH meta has always been a bit stale, tbh. The FOTM is trigs, what with the sheer power of the ships, but before that, damnations, lokis, legions, sacs, bhaals, vindis, sleips, all with a sprinkling of 600mil logis. Which are all rather expensive ships, now that i think about it.
---
Personally, I love nano stuff in WH space. So effective when used right. Also, assfrigs with frogi. And scorchacles. Bob bless.
---
#recycled
---
Ah, I see. Still does not mean he's not just some dude's alt, but thanks for explaining.
---
I dont know how to feel about that though, getting passive money where the industry folks go through alot to make the money.  People can not care about the PVE sure but then maybe get bank rolled by players that do?  And it seems that groups that organize themselves effectively can still have players doing the pvp only aspect and the organization makes money through refining tax among other services and otherwise? ...Idk maybe we should re-implement a passive isk way...it just sucks to never be able to touch moon goo yourself though like it was back in the day.
---
Offloading still far as i am aware.
---
I mean, we already lost local.  May as well lose our other most used form of communication.
---
Same here man, been out to sea so freaking much the last year I just set my sub to renew and have let it train cause it’s not worth getting started again for like 3 days
---
They barely gimp it, it’s not like you fit 6 DDAs
---
Run enough alpha accounts that you can mine out the site before the rats spawn
---
nice flair
---
Last I got grappled it did, and that was last night.
---
Autocannons are actually pretty powerful, both on the large ones on macharials, and the small ones on wolfs and rifters and svipuls. Buffing them would make them stupidly OP.
---
Got pointed at 42 by a stiletto last night. Grappler still has dark blue vs light blue colour, as far as I know if you're under the effects of both it does stack the icons though.
---
Source: got grappled last night. Did not win fight, either, so boo. :(
---
Adjustments to mining and ratting income (as well as insurance) can occur, but their main purpose is balancing the economy rather than changing how fights operate. That isn't to say that there aren't arguments to be made about how strong particular income sources should be, because making sure one particular source doesn't make all others pointless is important.
---
Balance changes (nerfs AND buffs) are also by and large fine, you just need to think about WHY. People want to nerf the ramjag because it drowns out the use of a lot of ships that are otherwise fine. Similar arguments could be seen with the Ferox in fleet contexts, or the VNI in krabbing. Sometimes these arguments are valid, sometimes they aren't, and CCP needs to figure out when it's worth changing something. For the most part the balance changes on ships have been alright recently.
---
The game is tough, but man... not everyone wants an unforgiving hell hole to the point you never have a shot if you make one wrong move before realizing even base mechanics.
---
Remember back when we had skills that provided training multipliers? Those could have drastic consequences that did nothing but serve to keep people in constant doubt, feeling overwhelmed.
---
I for one am all for making this game more accessible. If the arguement is for skill injectors being used for botters... botting is something that be scaled out instead of up without needing to inject. That's a return on investment in software/hardware and doesnt even apply to games, but software in general.
---
I unapologetically disagree with your statements just because that's the way it used to be.

No one has an issue with small groups being able to field 10-12 capitals. The real issue is with the megablobs that can shove caps and supers through that cyno ad infinitum, whenever they want.
---
What you want to be talking about is the cost of capitals and supers, and the fact that everyone has one these days.

Analogies here are blowing my mind. Contract haulers, market visibility, arbitrage, etc etc. Hope the move goes well, and hope the dollars from retro hoarded collectible crap contributes!
---
I've used this, it works just fine, though it has crap application to frigates and will certainly die to anyone who gets the drop on you (fly aligned to have a tiny chance to live), but it's cheap enough that you won't care.  The Vast site will feel a little scary until 1-2 of the cruisers dies, all the rest you named are no problem at all.  Don't be in range of all 5 towers in the ordinary, either, that's just common sense.

There’s *so much* to disassemble here in your comment that I’ve legitimately wasted more time trying to think of a way to explain this to you than it’s probably worth to either of us.

---
I followed this subthread to this very end. BO\_pilot is correct. You are wrong. Stop posting.
---
Yes, the old system had its flaws, but it created an incentive to fight (taking them R64s). The current system does not (because everything can cater to everyone everywhere).
---
How you are not seeing this is beyond me, but I guess you never played the game in 2005-2010.
---
There was no asset safety for POS's, is that what happened back then?
---
No you?  You stop posting, he and you are wrong.  I did play during that time, I just have a different opinion than you both.
---
I understand the sentiment, but it's a bit like saying that for the sake of equality, everyone who isn't blind should have their eyes poked. In the end, it is a game, and a lot of PVE players do PVE because they enjoy it. Hell, in an ideal game, only the players who like PVE would do PVE. 
---
PVE players also had access to moon goo back in the day, so long as they chose to PVP to get it (or if they joined a null entity and had a moon given to them). And even I did some PVE. But my 30 man corp had full SRP with 0 tax, and that's because we fought like dogs over a dozen moons. It was good isk, but it was also a significant amount of work, which we did because that type of content appealed to us, in the same way in which a PVE player does escalations because they appeal to him.
---
It's all about playstyle options, and this option was removed from us. And it being a game, the people who couldn't deal with having to do PVE didn't just roll with it. They quit. It wasn't fun. And that's the side that bothers me, more than all. I make a ton more isk by krabbing with dreads in wormholes.

So you are telling me that the way to go for new players is explore &gt; start market trading &gt; buy injectors &gt; fly rorq under papa goons cap umbrella? Because turbo crabbing is so fun? What do you even play for? Plus, you just described why skill injectors are bad for the economy. If new players can get into capital mining ships in under a year, then that won't be kind for the mineral price.
---
The introduction of nullified interceptors was the time of death for solo and small gang
---
I know many of today's players do not appreciate what a large role the gate camp played in fertilizing the entire content ecosystem previously so I'll try to explain.  Gatecamps were the only other reliable source of in-space content than ratters, where players are vulnerable in fixed locations in space for long periods of time.  In fact, ratters used to be pretty much AIDS to catch because instead of being self-tackling caps (smh when the summer children bleat on reddit about killing 5 min autotackle pve not being easy enough in 2019 tyool) the majority were 130-180km Caldari missile boats that ratted pre-aligned, and it was essentially mandatory to use blue scouts when hunting.
---
So the null to high pipes and even null to low pipes used to be the default destination of any roaming gang and were arguably the most important component of the content ecosystem.  When you got there, one or more other gangs would be contesting control of the gate.  All to farm the constant stream of players whose risk:reward calculation decided for them that, "well, there's no real way around and I value what I could be doing on the other side more than my shit."  This was 23/7, you could basically live in EC-P8R and never get bored and never leave.  Many did.  It didn't have that synthetic, forced content generation feel which results when an unnecessary mechanic is thrown in randomly for no other reason than allow attention to be demanded, it was the travel mechanic itself being coopted for content and everyone on all sides knew the risks and made their choices.
---
I used to spend a lot of time gate camping around when the interceptor changes went in, the effect was immediate and drastic.  Risk taking in travel gradually dropped to 0, nobody did anything without poking an interceptor through first.  So the gate campers lost the vast majority of their motivation to camp.  The roaming gangs lost the only reliable, fixed targets that weren't ratters.  Ratters, with the greatly increased attention from being the sole source of content in the game, began the trend of upshipping to cyno cumbrella carriers.  Solo nano cancer increasingly lost the ratter farm and eager camp/roam newbies to chase their kite.
---
I dunno why this never gets mentioned in these discussions or isn't as obvious to everyone who was playing at the time but I was there on the gates as it happened, Eve is real, and interceptors really did gut the entire content ecosystem virtually overnight.  There really isn't a lot going on in this game, when you headshot one of the key organic content factories it should not be surprising that it reverberates through the content ecosystem.
---
Honestly, Dust kept me involved with EVE Online when EVE by itself wouldn't hold my attention more than a month or two at a time. 
---
Shortly after Dust died I also stopped playing EVE really at all.
---
WH gas harvesting is a pretty good method
---
That’s some amazing looking rust

Back in provi within days, under my own corp. They set us to red within 3 weeks. When I asked a diplo for the reason of it, I was told that I had been seen lighting a cyno for a hostile, at which point I think I asked "what's a cyno?". It was pretty funny.
---
 Anyway, after that it was Love Squad, and that was a fucking blast.
---
If we didn't like each other, why would we play the same game?
---
What do you mean? We have been testing new features for years now (sov, citadels, new chat)
---
That's REALLY cool, a Cyclone would also look awesome imo.
---
No because you had outposts where people kept their stuff.
---
And then failing and restarting a new failure to replace the old failure. Rinse and repeat every two years or so.
---
I think you probably need a 50k MWD with the cloak.
---
All I can give you is a personal perspective.  E-Uni is a great... wiki.  Everything else requires a high degree of self-motivation and the rare skill to know what questions to ask.  The folks that move on to bigger and better things within the game most likely would have done just fine anywhere else.
---
What about a simple cap on number of representatives per space? If you run for csm you have to state who you're representing, wormhole, null, low, high. Each sectioning getting only a number of slots to compete for and now you have diversity as well as the people still voting and ccp would have to do is determine the amount of slots each section of the game gets. 
---
The reason I went with a security space category is because it's the topic and also would give fair representation to each part of the sandbox.
---
It could at least help the issue of over/under represented spaces in the game while giving people a platform to focus on, the part they are involved in.
---
I dont agree with the blinding point, I dont think its like saying that at all.  I also don't agree that PVE players had as much access to it back in the day, It is definitely easier to get access to it now a days for the PVE folks (alot are mining it themselves instead of being reliant on the hopes and whims of a large alliance level entity).  
---
"But my 30 man corp had full SRP with 0 tax, and that's because we fought like dogs over a dozen moons.

---
This is more what I am contemplating on.  It was a more direct source of value instead of the more complicated round about financing now.  IT is still possible today but requires a PVE wing probably seperate from the pvp wing.  I guess the original idea here was to combine the industry and pvp side into one group and for the larger blocks that seemed to come to be ( more so than in others).
---
I'm mad because I'm new and didn't understand the wording of the event.  About halfway through I was "eh I just need the last day really i don't care about these ones" and wanted to take a break from the obsessive playing i been doing since i started.  Come back and realize I can't just login on the last day.  
---
Any tips for fighting with their support people?  Probably gonna immediately unsub if they don't give it to me.
---
Sorry, you don’t know what you’re talking about. Auto cannons are an amazing weapons system. Their versatility is what makes them a go to weapon of choice. Only thing ccp did that was bad was nerf their range on pirate ships. Other than that, they sit perfectly where they are.
---
You actually can't use the cloak with an orca, it won't get aligned in time (unless they've changed it since I flew one last), so capitals are more maneuverable and safer in travel than orcas.
---

&gt; EVE fundamentally is a game about kicking over sandcastles
---
you can't kick over sandcastles without someone to build sandcastles. if kicking them down is easier than building them, you end up with an empty beach.

Hold on. So just because some guy on reddit says so, none of the ideas listed have any significance or validity.
---
Great, got it.

I think I'll form my own ideas rather than listen to the famous cyno droppers of LS. Thanks.

They can't.  It would have to be another week since updates are on Tuesdays.

---
Fair enough, I see where the misunderstanding is.
---
I just remember to that from that previous time didnt the passive income sources lead to massive empty space areas in null sec where a large entity would control massive swaths of space with no one actually being there except to show up to the towers if needed?  Though I suppose that could be more mitigated now adays with the whole ADM aspect since then and it possibly applying to the passive income.
---
Wait a sec! You had a capital in a shattered hole?
---
Edit: aren’t all shattered holes only frig holes?
---
You get 1 MWD cycle, because the cloak stops it from repeating.  Hit decloak right as the MWD cycle is about to end to prevent the cloak from slowing you down too much.
---
If your ship is particularly heavy (eg. lots of plates), you may need to decloak a little bit earlier to get more of a push from the MWD before it clicks off.  Like 1 sec before it ends instead of 0.5 sec.  Practice with your fit on sisi to get the timing right.  You will be *slightly* more vulnerable due to that extra time, but it's still going to be really hard to catch you.
---

The main draw of EVE has always been that it is consequence-driven. When you take that away, you really don't have much left IMO. Also, that's an absurd hyperbole you just made. Just because you didn't train into a slowcat fleet doesn't mean that your characters are trash: it just means that the alliance who collectively got its members to train for the same thing for the past year will have a well-earned advantage. Nowadays though, if CCP announced that the Chimera/Wyvern is the new hotness, alliances like TEST/GOONS who have shield capital fleets hold no significant advantage over alliances like PL/NCdot who instead focused almost exclusively on armour capital fleets. You simply extract the bad skills, inject the new skills and wait a few weeks for your new fleet to be built.
---
Amazing 👌
---
But not much has changed in that regard. Most of null is still empty. At least before those moons financed some group's activity, as opposed to being abandoned in space or left in the hands of RMTers. Plus, we had huge wars over them. The whole eastern side of the map was wrecked by wars twice a year.
---
Thank goodness content is returning. The most dangerous thing we've had to contend with lately is is a bunch of C.O.D.E. gangs.
---
There is. Go join a small group in Low/Null/WH they exist. And if you want you can climb through the ranks there and "be important" but even if you don't you will make a difference being there. Joining a blob is a decission it's easy and comfortable and thus the default choice for a lot of people but it is not the only choice.
---
New super pilot here, so not exactly an expert opinion, but I was originally attracted to Eve because of the meta more than the gameplay. I love how some battles can decide the fate of an alliance that's composed of thousands of people. Plus I think it's really cool that Eve is the kind of game that actually has a *history* to it.
---
Titans and supers are the key players in those decisive battles. The tidi sucks, of course, but I'm often watching a movie or multiboxing several accounts that aren't in tidi so I don't mind so much. I basically think of it as a small price to pay to have a role in setting Eve's history.
---
I threw away a bunch if these today too :-(
---
I dont know something have definitely changed yes there is still aloto f empty space but there is also I think more spread out pockets of people , its definitely not as bad as it was.  I remember the massive empire of Tau Ceti and how most of it was empty nothingness except the passive isk earning towers.  There was massive stagnation then too, and if I remember correctly that was before the ADMs.  They had rented out space to The RMTers as well and it was much the same.
---
No. I am telling you that:
---
\-exploration is by far the most profitable activity at low skill points
---
\-trade is a very good option once you have some capital to invest (from exploration)
---
\-and that rorq mining is a very good investment for any new pilot who manages to make money otherwise (to inject skills and buy the hull/fit/drones) 
---
You can mine wherever you like, goonspace is not the only option. 
---
Same thing with trading. 
---
The point is, new players CAN make money and CAN afford to inject skills.
---
This is a better explanation.
---
wtf how does this make any sense
---
ccp should just let the corp stay and ban any char that joins it
---
Nice. I love this ship. With snakes links drugs and best abyssal 1mn. You can get a succ going about 5.5 km/s give or take. With the armor fit the sig is so small ...

cloak first, then click MWD.

Set destination to BWF-ZZ. It's like, 10 jumps from Jita.
---
it's trivial under STV for groups like this to get their own rep on, as long as their playstyle is important enough they list other people from that playstyle on their ballot
---
if it's not that important to them they won't, and that's a good sign the playstyle isn't actually that important to them
---
I've done MWD + cloak on a rorqual and a BS-sized MWD (in the days before the capital prop module existed).
---
Had to overheat the MWD, and my capital shield booster took heat damage, which took a ton of paste to repair (also before Upwell and tether).
---
So ya, definitely possible.
---
That is a paying bot, CCP doesn't care for that one.
---
I’ve always been a fan of the idea of a spool up on cyno. Bonus bulls like command ships, CDs, t3c sub or whatever, penalty to it to shit like capitals, rorqs, similar to entosis module. Also buffs to inhib resistances
---
My money's on this
---
Yeah, but you are to immune to frig and dessie sized solo roamers. Domis also fit a cyno, and often live long enough for single carrier/haw dread to jump in and scare away attackers. Most people sitting in standing fleet are so bored that they would drop on anything they can drop on.
---
Yeah I'm in the same boat, probably would have resubbed my main to claim the +1m SP but since I've been fairly busy and not really that interested in playing I've missed out on the big reward.
---
I was just making the point that I didn’t rat or mine to get the titans, so the path to obtain them wasn’t hours upon hours of grinding though pve in that manner that many on Reddit consider the goon path to riches by krabbing.
---
Showing that it’s possible to make the money for the titans and have fun in ways that don’t fit the dismissive reddit narrative about goons.
---
God help me if this was ever turned into an Android app.
---
I kill C3 gas rats with a passive shield Gila.
---
Just to be clear: I'm not into the idea because I think the game itself would be fun or cool. I'm into it as a software developer. I'd have an incredibly fun time decompiling it and messing with it. Which is why they will probably never do it. But damn. Would've been so cool.
---

---
I prefer this video over the one he suggested:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uBcK_c8Gy4
---
If you go back and watch the entire clip, his reasoning for not reporting your fellow goons is that it can be hard to distinguish between a bot and a real player. 
---
But that obviously shouldn't stop you from reporting! Let CCP look into the matter. What mittens advocates is that people don't even give CCP the chance to look into the matter, which IS THE SAME as promoting botting
---
Fuck even change panic so it’s a minute of super good tank. Give it a last ditch effort. 6 minutes of invulnerability? Dumb

Oooo, eagles with mining lasers. Scary.

To be instant with a 50mn yea you need a cloak.
---
/r/Eve/comments/bolypd/the_mwd_cloak_trick_works_on_capitals/eni9x07/
---
Very cool
---
Anything that's used on Eagles is going to be doing quite well. Goons, TAPi, and Panfam now all use them as mainline doctrines after this last ferox nerf. And eagles get whelped like nothing else.
---
Congratz, the super umbrella now covers even afk subcap ratters.
---
It's very frustrating convincing people to fight my gangs of 4 or 5 people in kitchen sink faction kitey trash.
---
It's necessary to deliberately limit the amount of people in your gang, people in local, or ships your in because no one wants to fight in this game anymore.
---
I think the the game has developed this toxic culture of shaming people when spaceships die. There's no respect for a gf anymore, glorifying kill boards and being smug in local (remove it btw) give people the motivation to under hard counters, drop supers, or stay docked and not fight at all.
---
Just look what happened to brave. They used to be the place to get content from 2013-2014 or groups like requiem also.
---
No small gang entities go there because you will get huginn/rapier/cloaky Loki/haw dread/super 'd.
---
Watch old PVP vids like call of the wild, garmonation, everlasting, nobody fights the same way anymore as aggressively.

Only CCP knows how many new players get into the game plexing their first time by farming, they already lost L4s, that would make every drone boat garbage for alphas, not even faction drones in a Gila would suck balls. Not to say every pvp  frigate with T1 drones...

I've had some run-ins with Dirk. Good guy
---
I've been in a C5 shattered hole before. Not sure if there are C6's.
---
Salvage and active ratting group
---
Because I don't pay attention to this subreddit.
---
&gt;Well, if that happened, groups that consume massive amounts of resources would need to move, conquering space from other groups.
---
Why would they want to conquer already-depleted space?
---
What would happen is Goons (using them as an example only) would hold 3 regions instead of one. 
---
They'd leave two regions "fallow", and mine the fuck out of the 3rd.  Those keepstars, cyno jammers and other infrastructure are a pain to set up, so they're not going to set it up over and over again, living as nomads.  They'd just "rotate their crops", and slaughter anyone who attempted to interfere with the regeneration of the "fallow" regions.
---
&gt;as opposed to the “war” Legacy/Fraternity have had going for a couple months, where no meaningful structures were destroyed or space changed hands because everyone is too risk-averse to commit
---
I suggest understanding a war a bit before attempting to draw any conclusions from it.
---
China TZ is currently one of Legacy's weakest, and obviously Frat's strongest.  Which means Frat wins timers in their TZ, and Legacy wins timers in other TZs.  Since citadels are how you hold space now and citadels are fantastic TZ tanks, you're not going to get much quick movement in the war.
---
Basically, not enough Legacy is going to alarm clock constantly for a month or two in order to win a quick war, and Frat can't bring enough people in Legacy's TZs.  So it's a slow economic grind until one side stops finding it fun enough to continue.
---
True, we can at least hope that the money allows for continued development of the game we play and will keep it from just being let to die.
---
bet the autocannons would piece eardrums at that distance
---
To start with, I'd imagine that a boarding party would have to get to your ship somehow, so your defense would probably start with blowing up the troop transport before it arrives.
---
Secondly, given how Eve's clients currently work my guess is that most super pilots in this hypothetical would have a FPS account that would log in to defend their ship, but in a lot of situations you wouldn't want to. Tidi, sure, but no tidi? You'd be busy trying to fly the super.
---
&gt;but if they were to pursue this strategy, it would leave vast swathes of their space open and vulnerable when not in use, making life a whole lot easier for smaller groups and Alliances to move in and contest said space.
---
Uh...why?  If you let them move in to the fallow space, it's no longer fallow and it doesn't regenerate.
---
Also, that small alliance is moving into a depleted region.  They won't be able to get the resources and/or money to protect it.
---
&gt;For capitals (excluding jump freighters) it would mean some sort of disabling effect would be placed on the capital 
---
So you should remove dreads from the game then?
---
Nothing like a little BRRRRRT
---
Why exclude JF
---
We already have this with moongoo.
---
Everyone just sells their unique one, and buys the others they need from Jita.  Since both sides would be crippled by embargos, everyone's just participating in this market.

2 days is hardly a realistic test if want to call it that. Crabs have no issue taking a two day break. Now stretch that out to a month and then you would get a better feel. Not to mention it wasn’t actually removed. It was just unreliable most of the time.
---
And you can fuck off with your ad hominem bullshit.
---
Sarcasm... which is lost on many in this sub these days.. 
---
Eve has been ruined by snowflakes..
---
oh so how did you actually make the money? indy, market shenanigans? just curious
---
We still have moon goos that can only be mined in parts of the map.  It's not as constricted as the old system, but there's still stuff you can only find in the South and other stuff you can only find in the North.
---
The bot makers will adapt. They will integrate the near2 abilities to the bot and have boots reporting local at choke points. Do some currently do this? Maybe. But they all would if this was implemented. The only true way to fix the issue is better/faster detection and removal.
---
Probably self preservation. I have lots of stuff I'm not allowed to talk about regarding work, but even if I could be fucked to try to remember exactly what (and I can't), I wouldn't trust myself to not have a brain fart and say a bit too much at some point. So I just have a personal rule that certain topics are verboten entirely even if it's only a subsection of them I'm actually not allowed to yabber on about. And no, it's nothing cool, just boring contractual stuff and whatnot.
---
Probably a similar thing with the devs, if you're not in a major alliance, there's no risk you'll get drunk and let slip something you shouldn't and that will give that alliance an edge.
---
There are shattered holes for every class. GP is thinning of C13s which are frig only shattereds.
---
This is wonderful! Nice work!
---
Yes, there's a difference in how much of each goo is in each area, including some goos just not available in the South, while other goos are just not available in the North.
---
honestly 90% of small groups are small for a reason aka you have to avoid those ( and it's generally not by choice ), they also often have the small fish problem where really there predators dedicated how they have to play and while small gang fights are likely the best type of fights eve has to offer let's not pretend like there results have any impact on eve as a whole ( like the only people that care are really other small gang pvpers ).

Clearly you didn't watch the meta show last week he references  his previous statement and it explains it was said with the context of do not report them to GOONS and expect them to go fix the botter issue, he said report them to CCP its their job to actually enforce the game rules and they are the only ones with the tools to do it.

---
For a text/image based application it runs absolutely atrociously. Sadly it doesn't seem to be an issue for the devs.
---
Because the point is to drive consecutive logins. You had 3 spare days. If you didn't make 16  logins then that's on you. All you had to do was launch the game and click a button. Didn't even have to load in.
---
So you are saying nowadays nobody can be bothered to fight over moons?
---
And under the old system everyone fought over moons all the time?
---
Because that is exactly how it was, and that makes the old system better, period.
---
I definitely appreciate your point that cutting down a tree / doing a controlled burn can have benefits, as can some of your proposals, which is part of what I was getting at. They are also capable of doing more harm than good, but that's probably as far as I can push the ecology analogy. : )
---
What I meant by "sunlight" was exactly what you took away: opportunity.  You're right that supers and the larger groups are able to stifle many kinds of opportunities currently available in the game.  But there are gameplay mechanics like WHs and FW Plex where Supers aren't allowed and don't oppress. I think adding more activities in Lowsec / FW that are tailored in that same way would be a more positive approach than "ban supers." I've mentioned this in other threads about banning supers / caps in Lowsec, but I'm not convinced that banning one type of gameplay is going to magically fix other fundamental problems.
---
That said, I have less of a problem with banning supers as I do your proposals to nerf structures. I wouldn't complain if supers got banned, I just think people fixate on that to the detriment of pushing for more engaging FW content, which I think is important whether supers get banned or not.  I want to see CCP give FW / lowsec more meaningful options to do stuff in small ships / small gangs.  New stuff to do is what brings in new players.  Nobody is going to join EVE for the first time because they heard CCP banned Supers / nerfed citadels.  A Faction Warfare overhaul aimed at providing more accessible and better small scale content *would* draw new players to EVE and lowsec.
---
Souper cool!
---
&gt; especially with one lowsec alliance dominating all r64?
---
This never actually happened.
---
&gt; I know that the elite pvp players who used to be able to monopolize all the good moons hate mining with a burning, firey passion
---
This is also a fiction.
---
If you were part of a large enough block to fight for high-end moons, it got you some fights while making your leadership rich.  Those fights were relatively rare, because it settled into a cold war for the valuable moons.
---
Pretending your R16 in a random spot of lowsec was a conflict driver of massive proportions isn't accurate.
---
Small gang pvp started dying long before groups started casually dropping 10+ caps and supers.
---
Small gang warfare was in decline before supers even were a thing.
---
Jump bridges really ruined small scale pvp, because it removed the need to go through gates. Lots of early day pvp was about gankers ganking &gt; people forming to drive away the gankers. Rince and repeat.
---
There was also a spirit in the game of "defending your space" - a couple of years in people realised that the roamers would leave if you simply stopped undocking, which also because "meta".
---
Would give defenders another huge advantage in a meta where defenders (especially in Sov Null) have plenty of advantages.
---
Leave the blue donut. Leave the Blob. Join the flock.
---
[Fweddit is recruiting!](http://join.fweddit.space)
---
Not the only one but you're missing out. The "triglavian push" has reinvigorated my drive to play the game, and I have spoken with many others who feel the same.
---
Invulnerability modules of every flavor should be removed, along with microjump mechanics. Running away from fights is so easy now.
---
Check out what kind of star you have to use the sweet wh bonus.
---
This is the truth.
---
The need to use jump gates and transporting yourself and your ship was a super big creator of content.
---
And the limits of outposts. So that people actually traveled up and down the pipes to their ratting/mining/plexing area and then back hom to their outpost to log.
---
Jump bridges, cyno teleporters and 10k+ dockable structures was the big hits to small scale pvp. Because all of a sudden one could just ignore the roamers and content was dead.
---
or just log in Dust accounts while you watch Eve in slowmo XP
---
Sounds like standard Hilmar
---
&gt; So CCP pulled a Star Citizen before Robert Space Industries?
---
This was actually the same year that Star Citizen began development.

---
None of my ideas are there! FULL SPEED AHEAD ON THE ARMCHAIR GAME DESIGN TRAIN
---
wtf
---
Currently we are at a point where sandcastles are near free and made out or concrete. Were you aware that you need 5 T2 Logi cruisers to tank an antisubcap astrahaus? Even with those numbers it's iffy and requires the 2 people who aren't jammed on a given cycle to be good at cap chaining. In addition, it takes half an hour per timer for 3 timers with the last one set to a fuck you tz to kill it. And in the end the whole thing costs about as much as a carrier. It should be easier to kick them down  then build them at least for medium structures because people will defend them.
---
I'm glad you made this point because I thought the same thing, but didn't have as many specific details at my command.  I remember those times, and Snuff / Shadow Cartel were plenty capable of oppressing people in the T3C / HAC fleets of that era.  
---
"The larger alliances didn't bat an eye at the smaller corps having POSs cause it doesn't affect their gameplay."  This is what I'm talking about.  Lowsec / FW needs a lot more isk making activities lower down the food chain that the larger groups aren't motivated to curtail.
---
When someone just discovered Internet
---
i wish
---
Going by Google's track record Stadia will be discontinued in a few years so wasting development money on this would be right up CCP's alley
---
Nope. Just means more content heading ur way
---
Only Arizona peeps? or surrounding area too?
---
If a T1 cruiser would be a significant loss, then you would see way less people wanting to take a random fight, it would be bad (imo).
---
Nah, welcome to shitty companies. There are just too many of them.
---
you must be new here
---
I know someone one day would do this. I was curious to see how long it would take.
---
Got my Praxis ready for some RP kickass defence XD
---
And ofc filled with Quafe and dancers.
---
search in game for a corp with more than 1000 members. Should give you Goons,Test,Brave and Pandemic Horde. We are all newBro friendly. Goons are the largest alliance in the game, they work with test frequently in wars vs PH the second largest alliance in the game. PH is, in my opinion, more friendly and welcoming but I am biased. 
---
If all you own is less then a few million isk just abandon it. You will get a care pack of skills and ship when you get to our home in BWF. When you get here I will encourage you to join some of the caretaker fleets that will help you learn the game and make isk.
---
As I said blobbing is easy being small is not. You have to decide if you want to matter (in your corp/alliance) or if you want to have it easy. Also and this is coming from the leadership of a small alliance with probably one of the best situations a small alliance can be in I can tell you that recruiting people is real fucking hard just because you are small to begin with.
---
I was one of the proponents of getting rid of passive income. What I didn't realize at the time was just how little incentive the game had to drive greedy player expansion and over-extension, or how the optimal game-state would become endless krabbing under a super umbrella. Foresight apparently isn't one of my strengths.
---
You can literally decompile that right now, they don't even protect the code that they ship
---
Not even https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BinWA0EenDY
---
Well, JFs don't really matter here, because the effect would be combat based.
---
so the monochrome icons were pushed through by an asshole? that explains why they were doubling down on them.
---
What do you think about alliances like V0lta? They fit pretty much your playstyle and they are good at it.
---
Probably because OP has already lost too many.
---
I disagree, because it would let attackers engage with less worrying about SUDDENLY SUPERS. 
---
If it's for a timer defenders will typically already have the system cyno jammed, so you already have to gate or undock caps in the system, this is more for unplanned engagements.
---
This is accurate.
---
yes you should eve is a great game but i admit its not for ever one
---
Very excellent! On a related note, do we have any lore that tells us definitely that our ships can enter the atmosphere?
---
if you did it a year ago you should be able to fly an mighty enyo by now. so clearly something went wrong again in your proces.. i reccomend biomassing again and this time, for the love of BOB the enyo loving god, DO IT RIGHT YOU SCRUB!!!

MCAV STILL RECRUITING
---
Nice
---
No, but it would reduce the dreadbomb effect, and force each side to show their hand a little before suddenly capitals.
---

---
Damn, nice.
---
HELL YEAH! EVE is the fucking best game ever dude. Alpha (free to play) is restricted enough where you have the incentive to play but you don't miss out on any fun features of the game. I started out as an alpha and eventually moved to the P2P omega and I haven't regretted it since.
---
1)  Provi needs to get better at recruiting and have a bit more active training.  NRDS as a new player introduction to Eve is a very interesting phenomenon in Eve culture, and seeing it drying up some is a bit sad.  Wish I was a bit more socially adept to help out more with that.  :-(
---
2)  Caps online and N+1 are both a bit old.  There seems to be a few things that are without any counter other than escalation.  It's leading to Batphone Online.
---
3)  AFK play generally - afk campers, bots, etc, all detract significantly from quality of play.  It's a death by 1000 cuts, but it's still death.
---
4)  Structure spam.  I now need to filter out structures not by type, but by alliance/corp so that I can see the ones I need to see.  Or, you know, make high sec structures far more killable, or expensive to maintain (and then they deteriorate to the point of exploding when unfunded long enough, not just low power).
---
That is a rookie numbers my friend. You can offline that cloak and fit two t2 bcu's and mse. Say yes to 612 dps with faction ammo (cold) or 846 dps with heated rage. Now throw in cheap implants and drugs and you will get 960+ dps out of hound.
---
Since CCP is continuing to allow the MWD trick as a game mechanic, you seem to be too safe. Gotta change cloaking then.
---
oh yeah the transport would probably be a thing unless there doing boarding torpedo form say other capital so there is that layer off defense.   
---
what i more thinking off is ever ai defenses you can mange on your ship or something like auto turrets and traps you can install but don't have much control over,  
---
we have marines in the game as crafting items so what if you had them as a proper thing. maybe you could give npcs the ability to board peoples ships and the "auto defenses" would be based around defending an defeating these rather then player attacks, "the player's just being slightly slowed off inconvenienced by the auto defenses".
---
[This documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB1M9ZVuWtM) touches pretty heavily on the subject of the Incarna release. It was definitely eye opening for me, someone who came after.
---
I mean i get that small alliances have a recruiting disadvantage (but i hope you understand why i say to many alliances are small for a reason like i have dealt with my fair share of well shit leadership).
---
I'm likely at a wierd point in my time playing eve big tidi lag fests don't get me excited neither do the 5 v 5 or 5 v 10 engagements get me all that excited anymore, it all just feel bland and the meta where you honestly spent way to much time trying to get the fight isn't helping, the fact that honestly losing a 2 billion isk battleship isn't all that big of a deal anymore isn't helping.
---
Such a pointless post that happens daily. It's free, try it for yourself, only you can decide.
---
The chinese are already here, they are a tiny group of players and the tranquility groups have already blue'd them up. You're in a dreamworld if you think they will make any difference
---
2 types of cyno. Normal cyno for dreads/carriers/fax, Force Escalation Cyno that has a spool up time and can be used by supers. Let the hate begin.
---
Honestly Jester is proving what a shell of a game and soulless company runs the game. They mostly seem to literally not care.
---
Just because you have a good or great idea doesn't mean people will be receptive to it.  You have to be able to communicate your ideas effectively.  Yes there are shitty people and shitty companies, but often people use that as a cop out and excuse to cover up for a lack of ability to communicate on their part.
---
I have to fight my students constantly.  They plan to "blow the world up" with their "disruptive idea" but can't speak or write persuasively for shit.  They don't understand that no matter how great the idea, someone won't realize the greatness if you can't communicate to them your idea properly.
---
A well presented bad idea often wins out over a poorly presented good idea in reality.
---
Small gang is alive and well in Faction Warfare.  If or when caps drop, just book it (or better yet, counter drop on them). Have fun!
---
This here is why I haven't come back to eve.. I've made a lot of isk back when it was hard to make isk. I feel like what I have now is absolutely nothing anymore and the economy is vastly inflated.
---
Newbean is a term used in Pandemic Horde for new Horde players.   
---
The non-horde version would be 'newbro' or just 'newbie'.
---
I don't like how multiple accounts are basically required for most things in this game. Hauling, wormhole, capitals, mining, even some small gang pvp
---
Just don't die 4Head
---
Yeah, no, it would gimp capitals as a offensive tool. I'm usually in in team "nerf capital drops" because I find it ridiculous that its common practice nowadays to drop carriers on solo players. But making capitals useless after a jump would not be helpful for the game. IMHO the problem with capitals currently is that they are to damn cheap to not use them in every situation you can use a cyno.
---
100% yes. You can have experiences and friendships in Eve that are impossible to find in other games, because it's a true sandbox and almost everything you do in Eve has some kind of effect on others. Whether it's helping out corpmates, starting up a new market hub, making a bit of lowsec into a pirate haven, or becoming a loan shark, your options are only limited by your imagination.
---
u/ccp_falcon you guys going to extend it for one more day because of yesterday's failures?
---
Sorry to ping you but you're like the only ccp dev that is around here quite a lot.
---
Looking those small windows, makes you really realize how huge are Eve ships in real. Astonishing!
---
Don't let one person's opinion change your own.  Form your own ideas and enjoy Eve the way you want to.  One bitter vet's view on something isn't how you should perceive it.
---
I wonder if I flew with you under this same name way back in late 2008 early 2009 in rote kapelle. I remember being bridged out to the syndicate area by a ragnarok and that being one of the first titans I ever saw, and I think the first that ever bridged me.
---
very good work brother!
---
It's not losing support, the vocal minority are hurf blurfing about stuff because that's what people do.  Come join, have fun, and treat Eve like a hobby.
---
Observing the game from afar also probably means reading this shithole as if it's authoritative and not filled to brim with other people who don't play shitposting about how bad the game is.
---
Wow. I haven't played in a long time, but this AMA really feels like a capstone, or a resolution, of my own personal investment in the game. I can't shake the sensation now that I'm really done, the game is over. Thank you so much for taking the time to do this. You write well.
---
Fly safe, Jester.

Yup. I'm not calling anyone out personally because we didnt know the extent of the changes and how it would work with other shit, unfortunately what I feared would happen did.

I was part of a 1100 man alliance fighitng over moons 3 times a weak for about 3 years v0v

Mostly dyspro and prom, and later on tech.

Moons was the #1 place for 50v50 or 100v100 battles for years, be it in delve, fountain, PB or the entire north.
---
... Why are people downvoting this man?
---
If you have the balls for is the key word. Most dudes and for understandable reasons, don’t want to risk their titan they’ve worked towards for years for ballsy drops.

Plex is now fragmented in 500 parts, so they cost a lot more than they used to. If you want to have a chat instead of looking up content updates let me know. Otherwise just go look at CCP's website and go look at the last 5 years of expansions.
---
According to reddit Eve has been dying since 2003. Ain't dead yet. 
---
The game is *really* hard to learn at first, but totally worth it once you get the hang of it. Just make sure you find good people you can ask questions and you'll be okay. Don't stay in high security space, either.
---
Eve has been dying for ten years. Its player count cycles high and low with the seasons and patches. Its at a low point buy it could easily turn around with a good patch.
---
You need to join a corp that holds territory in nullsec. If you just enter as a nobody then you may get blobed. But as a member it's like your own home. nullsec is for people that take their time playing, like securely ratting and commanded fleet activities. You wont find instant action in nullsec. If you like to play fast and die young then join a WH (wormhole) corp. Both are great experiences.
---
Careful what you wish for tho. CCP upper management would probably push for Plex-per-activation cyno mechanics, the way things have been going. 
---
60 second warmup time, reduced by 1s per Plex spent. 
---
Would be entirely in character for CCP now.
---
I miss Gargant hosting the AT.... He was really passionate about it, and cared deeply for it.
---
with a *cloak*?? No way!
---
entire corp died out, I quit too, haven't played for more than 6 months, glad it happened...
---
Oh no I get where you are coming from I am just saying that you are the only one that can change something about your situation. If you feel like you don't experience the sandbox that doesn't mean it's not there.
---
Well I've already learned something, Test is still a thing😁😂 test was on the way out, no disrespect intended, I was part of G club for god sakes

That's awesome
---
You need to higher your skill in scanning, plus having a ship with boosts in scanning. The higher the level the easier you will scan. It also happens with the actual hacking, the better your skills at scanning the easier. That takes time, but as a newbie you can allow you to lose tries becase you need to open a few of them to get the ISK needed for you to go up in the ladder.
---
this comment is quite the ad for eugenics i must tell ya.
---
Still buying these?
---
A delay to the kill report doesn't seem like an inherently bad idea.  Depending on how the messages were processed, it could be rolled into the downtime batch processing every day.  However, since killmails are already sent in near realtime, I see no benefit to changing the existing system.  Any intel from sites such s zkillboard would still be available, and is most useful in gauging long term behaviors of other players anyway, in my experience.  A one day delay would not change that much.
---
True dat :P And sounds like it was basically being run for free anyways... :|
---
Well done!

In delve, me and a buddy went from having a couple nyxes to 12 total rorquals.we built 13 titans, he has 4 one of each, I have two. We sold the rest to corp at discount, all this over a 6 month period. He used a corp loan that he paid off in a month I was more organic. He leads the  gate camp in BWF along with Travis Wells. The only rorqual he's lost is one I killed because he bubbled my titan on a gate.  Tell yourselves what you want. The Spod Emperor of Goon Kind has won the game. At this point you all are just content to be farmed while we afk rorqual mine in Delve.

You can do it with a 100MN afterburner on an Orca with the right fit.  It benefits from the skill that reduces AB cycle time, so you can get in warp in right around 10 seconds instead of 12ish.
---
500MN X-type won't kill your cap and does the same thing for a Rorqual, carrier, or dread.
---
Which also got removed. It didn't work out.

You don't even need to delete it. Just delay it by 30s or so. Hell, I'd say to delay it by 10s per 0.1 sec below 0.0, so that more valuable space is also more vulnerable.

All too often people talk of the steep learning curve that Eve has, particularly from a PVP perspective yet for the right sort of determined individual 1-2 months into the game they thrive, get better every day and actually show that a few million sps can win fights if you do your homework and if you learn from your peers, like you say by asking the right questions.

But on a serious note, I'd like CCP to resume supporting the Eve app. It's probably not gonna happen, and the app is still useful for checking mail and skill training, but I'd like a combination of the aesthetic of the official app with the functionality of third party ones.
---
I just wanna play with my internet spaceships when I'm not at home. Being able to check buy/sell orders, look at fittings, things like that would be great.

Who gets to vote for the nullsec reps? Who gets to vote for the lowsec reps?
---
If it's anyone can vote for any of them, then you'll have alliances splitting across regions.
---
Goons, for example, have SIGs for wormholes.
---
Probably not since they excluded anyone who wasn't subbed on the day the change went live.
---
Pls more
---
By not voting yourself, and discouraging others from voting, you hand your power straight to those you don't want to have it.

Sure, you might not win, but it's made harder.

There aren't _that_ many eliminated votes each year.

FYI my minmatar shield caps warp in 1 mwd cycle without the cloak. Depends on the mwd (meta might need heat). Sure its not as secure as being cloak for that time, but at least a highslot doesnt have to be used for a cloak to get this effect.
---
Also... PSA. every hauler (including highsec) should learn to be good with this trick. I can haul about any value in a mammoth in HS and be safe as they can't even lock meh!
---
What's to stop Goons (for example), running a 'highsec candidate'?
---
$0.09 USD per hour? So $788.40 USD per year? Why would you want to do this?
---
It might incentivise smaller entities to challenge larger ones, though, since there's now reward to go with that risk.

They simply did not test the system adequately.   Nor did they seek input from anyone running xmpp in a large/heavy use environment.   They also failed to do basic research on the subject before switching.

Give local a 10 second delay. Deleting local would cause botters to run more alpha alts and put one on each gate in system to watch for gate flash. A 10 second delay might be short enough that they don't think it would be worth it, but still benefits hunters, or at least offsets the sometimes weirdly long loading times you get when jumping into a system/logging back into a system after safe logging.
---
If you offer me a trillion isk and a thousand dreads I’ll hotdrop all the krabs in every corner of eve ...... just sayin
---
Rorquals are bad for the game, that doesn't mean that other forms of AFK isk printing (which is what passive income amounts to) would be good to bring back.
---
The best use for it is giving some dweeb a second avenger wave when they think they can just steal your sites. Warp 100, cloak MWD out, o7 in local.

&gt;  I can’t say I see it in any sort of rapid decline.
---
No one is saying the game is in a "rapid decline" (and if they are, they're wrong) it's just that the composition of players is changing.
---
The people who original came in for big fights, meaningful losses, and high stakes sovereignty fights are leaving and being replaced with people who are looking to multibox VNIs, Rorquals, and just krab in general.

---
The serious answer is no.  This is propaganda for an ongoing campaign against nearby renters, I think.  If "Occupied Territories" is actually supposed to be Geminate and a goon sig is declaring an eviction war against Horde, that would be suitable cause for mild cheer.  Like a friend telling you they are dropping some candy off at your place for your birthday or something.
---
I'd like to add to this that almost any concept added to the game to "help the new guy" really can just be abused by the old and rich.  Injectors might allow new players to "catch up" to the older players, but they also allow the old and rich players the ability to scale to arbitrary number of accounts and useful toons.  Sure players could always trade toons on the bazaar, but at the end of the day the number of good toons on the bazaar was limited.  Now if I want to seed a sabre toon anywhere I can just inject it and have one immediately.  Old and rich players can abuse injectors far more than new players can benefit from them in my opinion.
---
This and there is a unending supply of talent who will move to Iceland to work on such a well regarded title. These developers are motivated and care to understand the community even if they have never been a part of it. The management culture however, robs key decision making from developers so they tend to churn out in 2-4 years
---
If by “mining yields and rat bounties” you mean “autism” then yes.
---
No, we're just more organized with defense and cycle belts well with the dark ochre rule.
---
More to the point, can we get a Monthly Points Killed list for corps? I pay out to my members based on kills monthly and I'd like a way to do it based on points instead so I could give greater rewards to the pilots that are engaging in proper fights and fewer rewards to the pilots who are just racking up T1 industrial ganks.
---
Aha! I forgot I can have modules that boost my scanners! Thanks!
---
Yeah, I was rather surprised when they cited server load as a concern. People ran IRC servers on 486s, man.
---
They hate you because you're right. NC. moved 400 caps, yes 400, to fight Welp Squad and Liberty Squad. And boy howdy, wouldn't Liberty love to have 200 eagles every fleet, but since the majority of the time it's half that we'll have to give the Northern liars their last hurray of bullshit.
---
Did you forget to change to your NC. reddit account?
---
Test is probably the alliance with the most allies right now. We moved to Esoteria in the south a while ago now and there's been a lot of stagnation since.
---
Ye that is what I meant.
---
Nah started kissing penifsmash in snuff
---
Yes, can't warn people better than in a shitpost.
---
We don’t cycle belts or have a dark ochre rule, sucks to be us I guess.
---
Every capital can use a 500mn to warp after the cycle. even titans. Need xtype on supers/titans
---
Every single cap can use a 500mn mwd to insta warp after the 10-second cycle.. Supers/titans need an OH xtype.
---
Can't stop welp squad from welping
---
It amazes me no one has been able to kill more than what they have. I don’t know what that says about everyone else, but I interpret it as an illustration of the complete incompetence our NPC Delve crew suffers from. Who is really more terrible? The krab with a shitfit rorqual or the hostile who can’t seem to bag more than the one snowflake every other day when there are 100s.
---
**Prediction:** Hostiles will circlejerk each other off with Delve krab kills to deflect from the fact that the entirety of their home and all assets are engulfed by the fires from a steam rolling storm of destruction.
---
Every cap/super/titan can use an 500mn mwd to warp after the 10 second cycle. Even a plated archon or a plated nyx.
---
Final answer: Fix the economy (Aka hire an economist, give them funding, announce a plan, and implement it.)
---
Was going to say remove invulnerability tethering from capital ships (leave the repair) but that is because I want to see more die
---
Pretty sure all of eve thinks liberty squad is a joke. They haven't done anything relevant at all, they almost never win fights and they have no good fcs
---
Its basically the gotg of goons
---
I dunno. Still, I think the representative idea is worth looking into, even if the current concept has flaws
---
No reavers who don't actually exist would be the closest thing to small gang. Liberty is like one maybe two steps up from mainfleet not good but not making your fc wanna down shots before fcing.
---
nope, passive income for the few is no good
---
Remove Asset Safety

Random chance of Pirate response fleet to spawn in any belt, yes, with pirate fast tackle.

Well thats a shame, he could have made a Corp or even an alliance with the following he’d garnered in SV.
---
depletion of mining and ratting anomalies per system with an associated respawn window causing ships to regularly deplete the area under the 'umbrella'
---
Make capships not locked out of highsec, but unable to target players in highsec. Having ships on parade in highsec systems would entice highsec only players to brave into low/null to see what they are missing out on. I didn't have any interest in leaving highsec until I was introduced to capital ships and how nullsec really worked. Now it's everything I want in this game.
---
The lowsec has better quality pilots meme always makes me laugh.
---
Rollback to 2012
---
Haven’t seen this one in a while; “you’re not killing us fast enough”. A true classic I think you’ll agree ?
---
Because he's wrong
---
Your posting screams "retard" much more than the kill you've linked
---
not in my experience, my nyx with dual plate takes more than 1 500mn cycle. x-type 500mn overload plus a few more sec is about the fastest it warps.
---
i'm still really new to eve, and only see a small number of facets to the game, but I'm gonna have to say get rid of local.    You have to brain dead or crazy outnumbered to be forced into an involuntary fight.  This would have to be balanced with application against small tacklers of course so large ships weren't suicidal.
---
He left because he was called out for CCP interfering with the markets during a fanfest. When their internal department looked into it it was proven that CCP was moving market prices via PLEX in-game.
---
molṑn labé
---
He's not wrong, you get at least one extra tick to MWD after you cloak.
---
If this amazes you then I don’t think you’ve really grasped the key mechanics which have stagnated eve over the past couple years.
---
This is a weird flex.
---
Looks like a dyson vacuum.
---
I can’t tell if you are critiquing me or in agreement.
---
You payed for me to stop shooting... But you didn't pay my friend.
---
Ban you and your nan.
---
Spaceships should require fuel and gas stations everywhere
---
I was under the impression that tritanium was extremely reactive to atmospheric gases so a ship couldne never enter the atmosphere of a planet. I remember reading that years ago but its been years and i have no source but i think it was lore
---
You can't activate your mwd with cloak active, and if you think you can consistently time it right you're probably wrong
---
CCP needs to double down on those focus groups they did awhile back.
---
You run eve 24x7?
---
Are they welp squad 2.0 where you don't even need to be a member to get the pings?
---
delete /r/eve
---
Honestly pretty fucking scary too
---
Make it a new game, again. 
---
Enthusiasm, new players, new gameplay mechanics to discover.
---
You know,  you COULD always try it out, see how it works for you. get your directors to bring it up and get that policy hammered out.
---
Here, I'll help. Here's 5 publicly viewable policies that goons have done that make delve the isk firehose it is today. 
---
1. Have a unified coms channel on your voice coms system for miners/raters
---
2. Have a defensive "umbrella" and focus on systems within jump range of your home
---
3. 100% SRP on any fax that jumps to someone and dies.
---
4. Start a single constellation (the closest/best one) with a policy of needing to mine the dark ochre first before you can mine anything else (mercoxit is exempted), enforced by a murder of the rorq for flagrant violators.
---
5. Nationalize and offer low cost refining in all major industry systems. 
---
You do those 5 things, you'll be sitting on so much ore and ratting isk, you won't know what to do with yourself.
---
It isnt all free if you pay the monthly sub.
---
Only the alpha gifts are actually free. 
---
Some people have busy lives and can't log in every day.
---
While this might not apply to you - here are some situations where it could effect you:
---
Your mums basement floods and your computer is destroyed.
---
Or your mum stops paying for your internet.
---
Your mum sells your computer for more crack
---
Or your mum stops feeding you and you need to go and get a job.
---
Or your mum decides you should go live with one of your siblings fathers and you cant get the internet connected at his house.
---
Some people have legit reasons to feel CCP have been a bit unfair with the log in requirements.
---
I've only seen like 1 other person with a black character in the game.
---
Bear with me here.
---
The biggest problem Eve has and always will have is the ability to earn free game time by buying plex
---
The vast majority of people who play Eve ultimate goal is to earn enough isk to buy Plex.
---
Nearly everything they do resolves around earning enough to buy plex
---
This creates a massive barrier to them doing what is Eve designed around, blowing up ships
---
Players do want want to lose ships as it costs isk to replace, isk they need to buy plex with.
---
You have this insane situation where people are spending countless hours trying to figure what is the most effective way for them to earn isk instead of playing the game the way it'seamt to be played. 
---
Plex is also the biggest driver of bots.
---
No you could make some major changes that I'm sure would see a huge uptake in new players joining and more importantly staying however it would mostly drive out many of the older players
---
At some point CCP is going have to decide what to do
---
Let the game slowly die because they don't want to lose the older players and just go for it. 
---
My idea is this and it's going to be very unpopular
---
Make Eve 100% free to play. Remove Plex as a way of adding game time and make it a way for players to buy isk in game. 
---
So for example a player wants instant isk, they can buy 500 plex for £10 and get say 2.5billion isk
---
I would then make all modules and ammo be built via NPC, no more player built modules or ammo
---
I would also streamline them so you only have T1, T2 dead space, faction and a few others, same for ammo
---
T1 and T2 modules can be purchased anywhere in HS/LS
---
Faction Mods only in LS in their racial space
---
Dead space and such only in null sec space NPC stations. 
---
Mobs can still drop modules. 
---
As for mining, allow players to sell what they mined to NPC stations
---
As for ships, upto a certain size I would make them NPC only built and you can buy each racial ship in their area of space
---
Other ships can still be player built but only in null sec which brings me to my next point. 
---
I change null sec in the follow way
---
I would make all of null sec empty, no rats, no missions, no ore belts, totally empty. 
---
Once a system claimed, they would control all gates into that system. 
---
I would have structures that generate ore belts, structures that generate complexes. The more they are used the more they generate
---
I would make so they become self sufficient. However each eare of space would only generate the materials to buy ships and maybe other items specific to that race
---
Now how would take over that space since you can't use the gates
---
Well you can stave them out, remember whilst they can certain ships they can't build modules or ammo so they would still need to get ships in and out. 
---
I would also introduce a new ship that is designed to hack and take control of jump gates. 
---
I would also change WH's. 
---
I would stop any structures being able to be built in WH space
---
Instead I would create new type of ships. The first ship to control the openings to WH's and second ship like a battle version of the Orca. 
---
It allows ships to dock to refit and repair as well as give bonuses however it would have very little offensive ability but be very heavily armoured
---
With these ships you will be able to use WH's as a way of making sneak attacks. 
---
So why would these changes work? 
---
The idea is to make ships and fitting them much cheaper and because players no longer have to worry about earning isk to buy plex, it greatly lessens impact of losing said ships
---
Idea is to make ships disposal items so people don't care about losing them
---
I would simplify FW
---
Get rid of LP totally. 
---
When you pick a side you are automatically you can only fly ships of that race
---
The more systems you control the less those ships / modules / ammo costs. 
---
I would also introduce ships that can only be purchased by those in FW once they control x systems as an incentive. 
---
I would also put maximum limits on howany people can join each FW race in order help keep each side fairly equal in numbers. 
---
I would change skills. 
---
Completely remove attributes. 
---
You would now longer learn skills over time, you pay isk to learn. 
---
Each book would cost isk and if you want to level up that skill you pay isk. Simple
---
CCP can introduce different packages for £££ that will give you x skill upgrades depending on which package you buy. 
---
You can also buy different packages that will give you fully fitted ships for £££
---
I know many people would hate most of not all of these idea but CCP need to do something drastic if Eve is to survive instead of the slow sad death its heading to. 
---
They have to change their model to reflect what people want today, not what they wanted 15 years ago.
---
It works alright for people who want to log in on things like Chromebooks when they are traveling, but you're better off going the [parsec](https://support.parsecgaming.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003642812-Using-The-Parsec-AMI-On-Amazon) route. Performance is a lot better than just running it directly off the instance using NVC or whatever
---
Hmm true, I hadn’t considered the cost of Omega. But, to be fair, I already budget $30/month for my two accounts, and would continue to do so even if I didn’t get the free stuff, so it’s basically free to me.
---
I'm fairly certain it doesn't work any more, but you could always test it on Sisi if you don't want to risk a ship figuring out.
---
There are probably some collectors who are interested, but most have already bought the ones they need. You can try putting them up on contract.
---
Because these are the battles that I remember.  
---
These fights have gravitas. They are important.  You can feel the amount of work that people put into making them happen and, at least for myself, I want to be there to help and play my minor roll in the big show by flying my big toys.  
---
Flying the Titans for me is why I play Eve.  My gameplay is centered around building these guys.  Aspirational game play for me and pretty much the only reason I keep so many accounts going every month.  
---
The tidi also makes multi boxing the Titan pretty fun.  Jump in, control bounce, get set up, and then hang out and enjoy the show. Good times.

WHAT?

&gt;Abysmal sites
---
I WANT MORE
---
i agree to this but only to a certain extent . For me eve had its own fail safes which ccp ignored . There is a skill book called "Capital ships" . This was a choke point where ccp should have drawn the line . You cannot inject past this . This would have not only stopped the capital proliferation it would have also injector prices capped injector prices much faster which inturn wud not have let plex go out of control like it is now. Because ppl not only wanted to sit on these capital ships they want to be a master of it . In its design captial ships require a lot of sp and with ppl injecting past 80 mil sp it only made them lose more sp . But this  was still profitable as more rorquals meant more more isk which could surpass the capital investment a lot faster(pre rorqual nerfs) . You did not need this skill book to be effective in eve .
---
Adding point/scram to null sites is a great start.
---
my reply above shud solve  the problem of " abused by the rich and old"
---
100% yes.
---
Don’t listen to the negative people around here, they are part of the problem and not part of any solution.  There are tons of great people that will help and give you advice to getting you started on your EVE Career
---
Corps have had players find other players houses, usually FCs to try and sabotage battle plans.
---
Not surprised.
---
Activating them on the same server tick and activating your mwd after your cloak are very different
---
You are too kind. I am poking one of my directors now /Michael_Wilmore mining director can you handle these 5 simple steps ?
---
&gt; you can laugh all you want, just shows how little you actually know. That 1 trillion number? that's half of what a kinda small corp from fucking moa had in its wallet. Yes corp, not alliance. in 90% of active nullsec alliances you can probably get a group of 10 guys(and that's highballing) that would be able to srp all that and still be fine, before factoring even alliance funds. You don't even need to offer srp for titans tbh, most titan owners can just replace their shit themselves. 
---
That all sounds nice and good, except in WWB there were wealthy GSF corps that ran partial-SRP programs and completely ran out of isk after only a few machariel fleet welps. And pressing your linemembers for SRP money WILL fuck you. There's a *reason* nobody does it anymore. 
---
&gt; you really believe that don't you? what won the war on the south was doom dropping the crack pipe and actually reading up on citadel mechanics and understanding that offensive wars are irrelevant post citadels. It was an inevitability, differently from what sapporo loves to say they aren't gonna be evicted by anyone unless they want to leave. It was not morale that stopped that, it was common sense when you mix mechanics(which took him long enough to grasp tbh) and the willingness for goons to come. 
---
You're asserting that everyone in a leadership role in that war were slobbering retards. That Elo Knight, Doomchinchilla, Vince Draken, whoever lead SkillU, and whoever lead CENTI were all fucking retarded and had no idea how citadel mechanics work. 
---
Oh, and you're asserting that none of those people know that they could just blueball major fights until Goonswarm's supercapital fleet stopped answering our batphones for fights that were like six goddamn jumps out of their staging. Which is a thing that would have taken all of a handful of blueball ops with waterboarding to accomplish.
---
Perhaps the time has come for the Asiatic Vespers of Mythradites.
---
Give cloaks a fuel usage
---
I highly doubt panfam will just hop on in with sort dragon. That's a pretty far fetched idea at this point.
---
And their inevitable replacement, rental programs for krabs and botters that leave nothing to fight over, is so much better?
---
No thanks
---
show me one war report where gal mil and cal mil actually fought for a hub in the past 2 months i'll commend your claim about FW being active
---
Not that I know of, though you might be able to go through the eve University website and download them from their respective page, which is probably easier than messing around the game files.
---
Definitely not losing support anytime soon. Yes play, if you hate it leave. But you’ll either love it or hate it
---
Blob warfare is awful. Trying to fight groups fielding significant amounts of logistics when you're already outnumbered is pure aids because it's binary whether you kill something or not. Damage inflicted means nothing and is utterly irrelevant, so going down swinging never feels good.
---
You know those remote controlled vibrators that twitch thots use? That vibrate when they get donations? The devs get those and they go off every time a bot gets banned or a small gang gets a kill.
---
Change jump drive mechanics - add some kind of variability to jump position or duration that's reducible via manual piloting (not SP).
---
This nerfs capital umbrellas, and force projection, but it allows elite players to use get around it in a soft manner.
---
I vaguely remember that... it’s been many years though. I’ve had these for something like 10 years. I might still have them.
---
Jump Bridges give 50% of the fatigue of jumping a cap/bridging
---
Delete local, at least as a source of perfect intel. Probably just make it work like J space everywhere except high/low.
---
I have others but that one would have the biggest effect.
---
I guess you've never experienced a proper armor brawl, or good kitchen sink small gang pvp. That makes me truly sad.
---
Pay squizz irl bux and all your dreams can come true
---
I get a portion of all plex sales
---
From the game's launch to about 2007. A bunch of stuff was provided by NPCs instead of being built by players. The early years of the game are a story of more and more BPOs being added to the game so that players could build more and more of the items in the game.
---
You 100% absolutely can. You get at least 2 seconds grace, even. Source: just did it with a 2 second wait after cloaking. And as a wormholer I cloak+MWD pretty often, I know how it works.
---
If you are decent at scanning it's neither tedious nor all that time consuming. It just takes some getting used to. Plus, actually exploring is pretty fun.
---
Personal wallet divisions
---
It isn't like they have to claim that anymore. GSF mines alone what all of eve combined does and even exceeds most if not all of hi-sec for production. We are well past "already replaced", and are in does it even matter territory.
---
just because it worked for a few months before falling apart does not mean it was fixed, if it was fixed we wouldn't be having this issue again
---
Its called context and you conveniently ignore it when it suits you. Just like the north is conveniently ignoring the fact their own renters at banned more, just like Elo conveniently ignores the fact that he just joined the biggest botting group in the game while announcing his intent to run for CSM on the anti-bot platform.
---
Then it happened on the same server tick and will terminate on the same tick as it would as if you activated it simultaneously. Cloak disables mwd. There's no built in grace period. You're not getting a magical two seconds where the server thought your cloak was off but it was really on. 
---
Watch your velocity. It takes server ticks to reflect the cloak activation as well.
---
Yeah honestly all the events are pretty boring and terrible.  Nobody wants to work on this stuff though.  Imagine how much less boring they'd be if every event wasn't a variation of the same original frostline sites.
---
There are individual charts with the category broken down.
---
It was 1.5. Here's the graph:
---
http://jestertrek.com/eve/players/archive/pop-alts.png
---
Unless there's something newer than this, but if there is I haven't seen it.
---
1. Appoint a Chair. Give that person a public voice with the support of the rest of the CSM.
---
2. Run a damned Little Things effort, formally, with a wave of requesting player ideas and a second wave of having players vote on the ideas. Then present the top 50 ideas to CCP. They're not that hard and they show a strong value to the CSM.
---
3. Engage the player base that isn't part of your null-sec alliance. Even if we're all pubbies, it's our money helping to keep EVE running. Without pubbie money, EVE dies.
---
I keep reading Strategic Mars, and I'm just gonna stick with that honestly.
---
Would expanding the amount of space possibly help?
---
I  remember hearing how in the first years groups would basically form to go out and settle new space, basically explore it.

TFW you don't know who Harvey\_Skywarker is.

16" guns, bet they would be loud for sure. What blows my mind is thinking how big and deafening 1400mm artillery would be.

You're wrong, just go try it
---
You misread the wording of the event so you're going to "fight" support until they give you what you want? Unsubbing sounds like a good move.
---
Get rid of asset safety
---
You mean to tell me you don't like fleeting up with BS+, spending an hour hunting down a site, spend another hour grinding kills, only to get a reward worth about 10million?
---
Fucking shocked!
---
But yeah, EVE events need grooming and they could be super fun. I take long breaks from EVE and last time I can't back they had added all the discovery missions, the new hacking sites were my favorite. They were dynamic and interesting, not just a cantainer to lock onto and click a module.
---
But this recent return was kind of disappointing. Events seemed promising but they were lame.
---
yeah, I've bought lots of plex in the couple months i been playing.   If they won't make a small concession for a customer that generates revenue, probably not a company I want to give my money to.

My issue isn't so much that there isn't a sandbox it's more than the people that get to build castles and show them off are well like 20 people, small groups might at best build a really tiny castle somewhere in an unused corner, where a theme park it would be a select few people the developers building castles and showing them to everyone. 
---
It leads me to the logical problem given it's like unlikely before the death of the game I ever get to by one of the 20 people that can build the castles and at best case after years of carrying around the bucket for somebody else his sandcastle why is sandbox a selling feature to me as a player? 
---
like sure I get to build a small castle and pray it's not in the way and get's deleted because there is shit all I can do at that point, but building a castle in a corner that you try to hide else it be deleted doesn't really feel like playing in the sandbox, and going on a castle tour well i rather go on a tour of castles by professional builders.

Pull the plug.

2013 was a great year for Eve Online. CCP had just re-balanced frigates, destroyers and cruisers. They all became viable ship for pvp. I spent over six months pvping in Placid. There were hundreds of active pvp pilots flying around looking for fights. Which must have added up to dozens of groups all looking for content and eventually providing content by running into each other. I had lots of good fights back in 2013.
---
I was so hopeful at the start, events were something I always felt was something eve could really use that most other Mmos had, and even eve had at one point.
---
Unfortunately these days though, if there is something I want from an event, I just wait a few days and buy it from someone for isk...that is if I hadn't won eve a few months ago.
---
&gt;Also... PSA. every hauler (including highsec) should learn to be good with this trick. I can haul about any value in a mammoth in HS and be safe as they can't even lock meh!

Till you find a gate full of concord / police, getting to close to your ship, preventing you from cloaking.
---
Remove Citadels
---
Every once in a while we get a Titan dropped on our wormhole if we get a connection to Delve. It's fun watching them trying to boson the hole when we jump through.
---
Whenever people kill shit, there is a "points" section in the mail. Can that be a weekly thing to see who has the most total points in a corp/alliance weekly, monthly, and/or all time
---
And even if they could, how does their propulsion drive enable a 'hover'?
---
Remove skill injectors.
---
There is 100% a grace period to activate non damage modules. You can use it to cycle your shield / armor reps and invuls along with other things.
