On second thought, you wouldn't like it. You should just stay inside.
---
---
---
What would you like?  You know how they operate, you can see when they're in the area.
---
I don't understand the concept of millboard trading. I guess it's kind of like a high score or something like that? They both died. What's the point?
---
"We aren't out to ruin the game, we are out to ruin *your* game."
---
I feel this is an advertisement in disguise. Autpilot at 0.....
---
FW idea to concentrate war is excellent
---
No, they spend a fraction of the cost of your ship for the chance of loot dropping that meets or exceeds the cost to replace their fit.  Popping a bling pod is just icing on the cake.
---
They're not teaching. They're not doing it for any other reason than their personal enjoyment. Most of them hope that you get mad over it, because they love misery. And they love lawyering you on the fact that it's a valid game style.
---

---
The one thing to learn here is that Eve is a different game to different people, and we all play it our own personal way. These people exist. That's it.
---
I will never agree that risk should be higher aspects of random (for this game atleast). Honestly, the rewards are not as good as you think. There is a lot of talk about rewards but if you subtract what Delve does you will quickly find that everywhere but Delve is kinda bad. It was already at a breaking point before this.
---
Thing is, people like different things right? I dont enjoy anom ratting but it does serve a purpose for me, I can relax doing it. Not everything has to be high octane. And I like capitals, they are fun to me, and also the big fights.
---
Mind you, I like small gang very much. Perhaps even more than big gang. But I understand that there are limitations. I dont fly with small gangs to kill big stuff. And I understand that it would be insanely broken if that would be commonplace.
---
"Some people are asshats"
---
i just told you. also why would you fit weapons on a dedicated screener/drive by? waste of space. also last time i checked the garmur has 3 lows. now there are ships better suited for this than a garmur. but if you want to use one for that role there would be no reason not to stab the shit out of it.
---
What if there was no blackout, but entering a system either by a) Wormhole or b) Covert cyno/covert bridge hid you from local in that system?
---
Gives a good buff to blops, and still lets people be the spooky wolves just behind the treeline that they could be with blackout, albeit with limitations (can't move systems) and more planning
---
Or the filthy rich just park 3+ more keepstars on the same grid to store all their Supers
---
There is such a thing as too much of a thing as well.
---
I'm not. I don't own a mining fleet in hisec. I'm just trying to pound it into your thick skull that you can't actively fight gankers like you originally posited that they should.
---
well  tried roam nullsec..   lost few battleships in one hour.. they hell camp much more than eve...and ship lost is lost in pvp.  pve-loss  autorefundable
---
Na I've done it dozens of times just to give a high seccer a nice adrenaline rush.  Didn't even loot or care if I died before they did. 
---
All in good fun.  I just hoped I turned someone into a pvper.
---
Clones would pop up for die-hard fans, but the world is too dumbed down for Eve nowadays.
---
Once a gank has been fired, no, you cannot "fight" them because they're a one shot weapon.  But you can avoid them VERY easily.  I'm trying to pound it into your thick skull that you can be safe in highsec if you use even the barest of precautions.  But I suspect you've been touched by a ganker before and you're still sad about it.  I suspect you want CCP to make your highsec a safe space.  I suspect you need a trigger warning before playing Eve.  Tell me more about my thick skull though, since I'm the one crying about danger in a PvP game.
---
Just smash keys and pve is what people look for 😑
---
C1-C2 aren't great money imo. I have no problem with frigs adding scram the higher up you go, as a following comment I made indicated.
---
So...it has things that are obvious sci do things?
---
r/eve is as close as you can get into EVE without installing it \^\^
---
I like just about everything. I would add that shooting/entosis'ing ihubs, as an offensive action, on a final timer should generate a kill mail. Toaster'ing is a pain but I should get a shinny KM out it. 
---
CCP here is your road map for the next 9mo's !
---
"please orbit him"
---
miss, miss, miss
---
Yes.  It is fun to kill anyone.  Since real pvp is dried up after years of mis-management and neglect, I did it just to kill something.  
---
It was fun, and I got an adrenaline rush hoping that I was giving that miner an adrenaline rush.   Maybe I made a pvper out of someone after that.
---
Heh!
---
When I saw the name of the video EVE: A FUTURE VISION and then I saw what looked like a collaboration of DUST514, Captain's quarters coding and reminding me of star citizen somehow.....
---
They should call this a VISION OF THE PAST!
---
Old ideas with a fresh skin.
---
Thats Eve, forever
---
Good question, thank you for asking that.
---
Hopefully CCP will read and learn from this thread, but I doubt it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
First look at the CSM - this is a player elected focus group that has various forms of electronic communications and get flown out to Iceland  to have in person meetings.  They dedicate time, money and resources to this, make them sign an NDA, monitor them and interact with them.
---
And when they have an idea like the blackout, and the CSM says "I don't think that this is a good idea"  or "Don't do this, it is easily exploitable" or other negative feed back, CCP just ignores it more often than not.  Meanwhile if the player base is asking for bug fixes, or other changes,  the CSM practically has to use thumbscrews to get CCP to pay attention. 
---
Lesson: If you are going to have something like a CSM or focus group, try listening to them.  This goes double for many CCP people, Hilmar in particular ,who have demonstrated a devastating ignorance about this game, yet make these changes.  
---
Second, and this is an industry issue right now,  CCP is falling prey to the "greed is god" mentality which sacrifices EVERYTHING in order to get short term gains.  At one point this even caused riots in game.
---
Lesson:  Scamming your customer base generates short term cash, resumes and job searching shortly thereafter.  
---
Third,  also an industry issue,  the customer who is paying you is not the enemy.  Seriously, we aren't, we want to have fun and enjoy your product, and pay you for it.  That is the exact opposite of an inimical relationship.
---
Lesson: Ivory towers just alienate your customers, who will then just give their money to someone that does not regard them with pure contempt.
---
Fourth, this change was in the form of a nerf.  All too often devs and companies reach for the nerf bat to fix things.  The nerf bat is often the wrong tool to fix game balance or other issues.  The nerf bat has its place and it is needed for some things, but it is not the perfect solution to all things in all cases.  If you look at many of the recent changes in this game, most of them are just nerf after nerf, all piling on one segment (null sec) primarily.  This just removes game play and players.  All while not addressing  significant issues impacting game play that people have been complaining about for years.
---
Lesson:  Look first to adding game play, balance passes, adding items/capabilities or environmental changes first, then only nerf as much as needed.  Also, 15 years into a game, be extra careful when making changes to fundamental parts of the established game that impact the largest player base in a negative manner.
---
Fith, this change was made to try to fix some economic issues and botting.  It was the biggest and latest one made in a series of changes that primarily targeted one sector of the game.  It was made with an eye to those things in exclusion of all else.  It totally ignored the impacts to the largest segment of the legitimate player base.  It also ignored the cumulative effects of this change in combination with all of the other nerfs that have been applied to this same segment of the game and player base.
---
Lesson: look at this stuff both in tight focus and in context for the game as a whole.
---
Notes:
---
1)  While I have endeavored to keep this impartial, I am part of a large null sec entity (Goons/Imperium).  My own bias might impact what I have said.
---
2)  My membership to this large null sec entity (Goons/Imperium) is likely to attract negative comments as many do not like us.  (some with good reason, other because meme/fashion)
---
3) My group has the majority of the CSM seats and thus my comments will rile some who hates Goons.  I would point out that they were elected, and thus are selected by a majority of players to represent them.  My comments were fueled by talking with some CSMs and reading other comments by past CSMs regarding their interactions with CCP devs etc.  Most of these are/were not Goons.  The general feeling I got about CCP and its use of the CSM is not very good. But, I have not been on the CSM myself and have to rely upon accounts of those who were there, heavily filtered via NDA.
---
I d like to add:  
---
\-remove all ingame and API/ESI/CIA/KGB/whatnot-support for player groups above corp-levels. Current game-tools make "leading an almost infinite sized empire" way too easy IMO.
---
Not if there's some sort of citadel cap for system, like there used to be with POSs. There should only be a max of 1 or 2 keepstars per region imo.
---
&gt;Ganking random miners in high sec, I don't understand. What does it gain you? Best case you get some mining lasers, maybe some crystals or MLUs; most expensive part of the Hulk is the hull. Do you want those cans of delicious low-end ore? Is an unarmed mining ship a juicy killmail?
---
#
---
&gt;I just can't figure out why anyone would consider blowing up a single ship and instantly dying at the hands of CONCORD to be rewarding gameplay. It just seems to me, like a situation that has no winners, just one side that loses slightly less than the other side.
---
Trying to put yourself as superior to the person causing you grief is a definite sign of being salty.
---
&gt; I'm trying to pound it into your thick skull that you can be safe in highsec if you use even the barest of precautions.
---
I already know and have acknowledged this multiple times.
---
&gt;But I suspect you've been touched by a ganker before and you're still sad about it
---
Actually i've never been ganked in highsec once in my 6 years of playing. Because i know how to keep myself safe.
---
&gt;I suspect you want CCP to make your highsec a safe space.
---
No. But honestly it won't matter if they do or make it less safe because i don't live in hisec i live in wh space.
---
&gt; I suspect you need a trigger warning before playing Eve.
---
This attempt at character assassination would be funny if it weren't so pathetic.
---
&gt;Tell me more about my thick skull though, since I'm the one crying about danger in a PvP game.
---
***Avoiding you*** is not the same thing as ***fighting you***. I don't know how many times i need to repeat this for you to understand.
---
Why do you need to fight me if you live in a wormhole?  What's your beef here?
---
Because honesty and fairness are important to me. It's fair when you gank a hisec mining barge. It's dishonest when you say that target could have fought back.
---
Thats barely 2 decent ships. Want pvp...but dont want a way to afford it. REEEE
---
&gt; Large capital battles usually happen by accident 
---
Only if you stopped paying attention at B-R.
---
The last one was X47.  The one before that was UALX.
---
&gt; but I expect a battle of keeping cynos alive can still present a way of having future capital fights. 
---
Please show how you manage to keep a BLOPs alive when the other side has a large ball of supers on grid, and you have zero capitals on-grid.
---
Must be pretty tough going.
---
Well if its zero risk why don't you tell us what system you typically rat in?
---
Following up - I did this while responding to you:  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78991738/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78991738/)I did it because I can, because I am a "dick" and because you annoyed me.  His blood is on your hands.  I podded him too.  Enjoyed every second of it.  I just pulled Concord, and I'm going to do it again in less than 15 minutes.  I wasn't even going to log in tonight, but you've driven me to it.  I feel compelled to punish highsec because of your stupid thread.  
---
From now on, every time you post on r/eve, I'm going to kill a newbro in a Venture.  You've been warned.  Call me a psycho, call me a dick, call me whatever you want.  Just don't call me late for the gank.  This is your fault.
---
I ain't got isk to fight 10 bil isk cruisers.
---
Fine, semantics are your specialty I see.  He cannot "fight back." Nor should he.  He can prevent the gank though.  But everyone here would rather bitch and moan about ganking in general than take normal precautions.  Glad you're not one of them.  Now stop wordsmithing and get back to that C320.
---
They really are man, I promise you. They are the most cancerous fleet comp in the game atm. They rock BS levels of dps whilst having frig sig and mobility. They have logi which can offset damage from even capital blobs and they use booshers to dictate range. You have to land right ontop of what youre trying to save otherwise they just boosh to the other side. They have retarded range as well and they can hit subcaps pretty well, enough to alpha even frigs off grid (full fleet volleys alpha everything subcap).
---
So you either have to bring full subcap fleets for counter which never works since you dont have time to get enough people in those minutes you have for a save (even if you did they would just warp off). Or you drop caps. Caps will die to them but if you manage to kill enough booshers that will cripple them enough to disengage. You dont kill those fleets, you just feed them until youve managed to kill enough support ships. The butchers bill always looks grim for the defensive side. And this was before the cyno change, now its even worse since you cant land ontop of what youre saving. So they just bubble your fleet from cyno pos and boosh over to the other side.
---
Imo spool up would be worse for offensive engagements. As you say they will get DDed right away before dropping in anything. I would rather have recons than that because then atleast you cant get targeted DDed which atleast gives some time. If you light multiple recons at once it will give you a chance to get stuff on grid but this is theory, tidi tends to break theory. But this is lighting cynos from range. Which still leaves the issue of trying to warp closer.
---
Idk, Im waiting for the first fight to see what tricks people pull. I dont think anyone wants to be the pioneer tho. Risk is you only get a couple of ships in and they melt and you only need one bad whelp for FCs to stop using them until shit gets fixed.
---
The acceleration gate is not in dead space.
---
[Nor do I! ](https://abysra.com/character/2113210767/) But I still do it, get some good fights, and have fun!
---
well captain obvious would never undock. if they will copy more things someone will get surely triggered..
---
Krab here.
---
I think that the whole hull type needs some love.  They have some nice parts and many glaring weaknesses and frankly are not as viable in its given roles as I would like them to be.  I'm not sure I am totally on board with this idea, but I really hope they do a balance pass on BLOPs (and hopefully not fuck it up cause CCP).
---
show me purple miner!
---
What you really said:
---
&gt; REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
when  you mine with orca  make sure you are near.. if ganker comes   store attacked ship in orca,dont engage ganker .
---
keep dscan open and   have someone with combat probes to do scans from time to time,if u notice bunch of catalyst,thrasher,talos,tornado on dscan or on probe scanner  DOCK UP
---
It would be _spammed._ AoE damage is such a force multiplier its unreal. Yohr DPS would scale with the number of anchored targets.
---
You also feel like your losing out whenever your not in your learning clone.
---
Yeeaahh... wow. Glad you could let off some steam though. I don't know where you got the impression I want my hand held, I've got plenty of holding already.
---
On hold. Reason: "I noticed you have had some interactions with (Friend's name)." Replied within 6 hours to clarify the situation, on hold for another 2 weeks (and counting).
---
Obviously I've been playing the game on my own and finding stuff out on my own, I didn't have any other choice. I guess I could go hang out in Brave space and try to use their stations while not a member of their corp, but that seems like a bad idea to me. I could be wrong, I am new after all.
---
Anyways, person above suggested joining Brave, I caution that they'll be waiting at least a month. More if you screwed up and made any friends. I don't feel entitled to join Brave or anything, just providing my experience with them as it seemed relevant.
---
literally who krabs in C1s though
---
If we're handing out ponies, what I'd like to see is super deep dust belts around planets orbiting end of life red giants.  You can fly as far into them as you want, because they are procedurally generated.  
---
D-scan doesn't really work there, in or out, and neither does local or cynos or even fleet warping.  When you're in the deep, you're on your own.  The only way to leave is to find an exit node, find a clearing that characterizes most non-abandoned sites, or find an acceleration gate leading to civilized space.  
---
Down in the deep is where opportunities spawn.  Data sites, scroungers, npcs doing industrial activities, faction police running odd drills and clusters of asteroids can be found out there.  You'll never know what until you run across it, and if you bookmark it, maybe you can find it again later (until downtime) or your friends can make the trek.  Probes are useless, and D-scan only works a limited amount to give a hint of what might be found in particular directions, but with no range data, only signal intensity.
---
Wardecs were used to grief newbies who joined corps run by people who didn't know how to lead a corp. The wardec system was never perfect and I spent years advocating change to that system, but what we got was further trend towards opt-in pvp.
---
It was never wardecs that caused newbies to quit. It was "leaders" who told dozens of players to dock up because a one man corp wardecced them. No efforts at fighting back. No effort at teaching them how to survive a hostile in Eve. Just "welp that's it boys, dock up for a week until the bad man goes away."
---
Those people have been given greater protection to continue teaching new players to be risk averse. THEY are why new players don't stick around. Why keep playing whenall you know of the game is a year of hanging out in highsec running the same missions and mining the same belts?
---
put hull  tank on your barge  it can survive one catalyst
---
So go do something else other than krabbing?
---
A lot of people have reached that point.
---
I think this is the best solution. This would also solve alot of the umbrella discussion because the more spread out people are the weaker the umbrella will get. And it most def brings some balance to the table and punishes big groups which might make people rething about being in a bloc.
---
it can stop it by  surviving the damage in 0.5 all depends how its fit
---
Why so you can plop an afk cloaky ship? That's literally the only viable option to kill any semi-smart player.
---
&gt;Why though? Is it really fun fighting something that cannot fight back?
---
So, I'm annoyed by suicide ganks but you have to accept the fact that this is Eve.  You actively consent to PVP every time you undock.  Is this very first rule of Eve.  Someone else was just more prepared for that PVP than you were.
---
I already have a pvp fund, this is just pure greed. Maybe I'll but some shiny new skins.
---
i make 499m per day
---
i would recommend  ganking miners
---
500mil is 1 hour of running lvl5 mission in lowsec, 1 hour in a C3 wormhole or half hour in a C5. All these activities are just as safe as ratting in nullsec if you know what you are doing. Well in theory they all ain't perfectly safe if someone does take the effort to set you up but realistically speaking Northern Coalition. isn't going to come gank your shitty fitted ravens. Now tell us how long it took you to rat that 500mil in nullsec.
---
Grath being positive, think I need a shower:)
---
Why are you still posting?
---
CCP used to have a kind of roadmap/possible future things happening page.
---
Why wouldn't this be a terrible idea?
---
This is what happens when you rely on statistics to inform future decisions.
---
No
---
+rep
---
&gt; still what's the same sort of game I used to play or if it's turned to garbage like so many other games have before it 
---
A little from column A and a little from column B.
---
Sub cap defense fleets need zero buffs.
---
Defense of any type in EvE needs zero buffs.
---
At all, until the servers are shut off.
---
o o f
---
You said it was safe.
---
Wrong, frt logo should be on a bot not a real crab
---
I don’t have my email :/
---
Naw man you haven't heard? I gotta get back to farming that blue loot destroying the economy, much unlike delve which is perfectly healthy and good for the game. A goon told me so.
---
So, you want it not to be safe, but not too much, enough so you can have a little of adrenaline.
---
Ugh portland. Why can't these things happen in places that have fresh air still?
---
Welcome to Eve dude. Griefing is built into the game and highly encouraged by CCP. Yet people dont understand why we have lousy retention rates.
---
And we want to make that mega null coalition easier why?
---
When I was a new player I didn't understand the + attribute implants and attributes in general. I quit from frustration.
---
I came back 2 years later and got hooked at that point. I still can't comprehend how ccp would have such a crappy mechanic that only frustrates new players. For old players attributes are almost irrelevant.
---
I love the idea of giving Rorquals the ability to bridge mining ships and making them focused on boosting. I wasn't around when they were first added to the game, but the description in-game as the ultimate mining support ship for extended fleet operations doesn't really match how they've effectively become the number one mining ship for solo yield and multiboxing.
---
Literally no one. Which is a problem yes? Not going to get better by scramming newbs.
---
Delete HAWS altogether...
---
Do you use Gmail? If so, check your promotions inbox. I used to only get the AW emails in my promotions inbox until I changed the filter.
---
"Are you there God, it's me Margaret? "
---
Oh look another C'Tan monument, have to drive around it...
---
Yeah I don’t like titans either.
---
Not to hire CCP employees.
---
Because what would take about 2 hours in null sec to make takes about a day and a half at best, so the value perspective is all messed up. Aka they dont understand the concept of don't fly what you can't afford to lose.
---
I like this idea. And for all you haters, how dare you downvote bbtb? Heretics, savages, risk averse casuals!
---
&gt;these activities are just as safe as ratting in nullsec if you know what you are doing. Well in theory they all ain't perfectly safe if someone does take the effort to set you up but realistically speaking Northern Coalition. isn't going to come gank your shitty fitted ravens. Now tell us how long it took you to rat that 500mil in nullsec.
---
\*1 hour in a C3 with 2 turbo rattlesnakes and half an hour in a C5 with two dreads.  
---
\-fixed it for you
---
What is the minimum time from newbie frigate to titan, in skill point hours? (Ignoring actually getting a titan built/bought)
---
I just made 400 mil in 2 hours of exploration and i'm basically a 3 month old noob... you make "OK" isk
---
If you haven't done much ganking there is a certain satisfaction in getting the fleet coordination, DPS, range etc right.
---
BF 2142 was actually the first BF game I played. I was young and loved the mechs and stuffs but I was very bad. I could have eaten a cookie after each kill and had zero chance of becoming fat.
---
Don't tell me how to play the game I pay for!
---
I'd just move systems bro. Get it?
---
OK craaazy idea but hear me out. WHAT IF you just used ONE rorq, and fit it cheap with like miner 2s, and then used like, command boosts with maybe a a few covetors or something? You could get really wild and even think about adding a Hulk to the mix!
---
Posting to add my voice to the CCPlease on this. I appreciate what you tried to do with Chaos and all, but start ticking things off this list and you'll go a long way toward breathing life back into this game we all love.
---
You missed the point. Wormholes have NO local. I did this a few hours a day, while surfing the net and watching tv. Bad game design, but I guess that's what Eve's become. Sadly.
---
Damn, imagine being this retarded...
---
There's already a Trilogy of Eve short movies...lookup Clear Skies on youtube
---
FANTASTIC IDEA BIG BILL I HAVE UPVOTED, LIKED, SUBSCRIBED, AND COMMENTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11111111111111
---
Be a nice primer for Vegas, thanks for putting on another kilo!
---
 Lear skies is about as good as it’s ever going to get
---
This is one of the best balancing suggestion posts the sub has ever seen
---
Meanwhile I lost a battleship last night that never happened during blackout
---
HiSec miners are like empty calories. They are delicious but you don't feel fulfilled afterwards.
---
Move to provi and try
---
 I'm talking about a professionally-made Hollywood-quality movie.
---
The only relevant jump drive nerfs are ones to speed of jumping, not which ships can be jumped to.   
---
A group of organised players will *always* work around any ship limitation... through organisation(duh). Being prepared in advance means you can keep doing the same actions.
---
I'm safer in my crab hole than you are in your anom, lol
---
\&gt; if you know what you're doing  
---
The barrier for this in nullsec w/ local is so low that about 100 lines of javascript written in 2010 knows what it is doing.
---
Lol I think this guy is attempting to troll gankers with all this
---
I'd greatly prefer if a third fighter was added. Light fighters with great application and low dps and attack fighters with bad application and high dps. Leave SS fighters as they are for purely carrier vs carrier gameplay.
---
Like I said, bad idea, but here's my lore:
---
The empire war between Caldari, Gallente, Minmatar, and Amarr comes to a climax and all of the empires are destroyed. Concord goes with it. Empire control falls apart and the system drop to 0.0 sec. Meanwhile, the krab empires in the null regions are strong as ever and hilariously become NPCs. The Imperium, Panfam, TEST, and, idk, Winter Co or whatever become NPC factions. Existing null becomes high sec.
---
Looks shit, honey-bunny.
---
Hey, can you apply for a position at CCP, please? Looks like they might need you.
---
My point is that we don't want that.
---
&gt;EVE is too old already and CCP has shown several times they dont do well when trying to expand out of their flagship game. that vision cannot be fulfilled in this environment both codewise and developer wise.
---
they "dont do well" with anything it seem  
---
just look at the blackout, a complete mess (a good idea btw but not enough) they don't have any idea how fixing their own game and they should create anything else ? naah
---
&gt;Light fighters should be able to apply well to light ships.
---
Then they should also do 'light' damage, not 1500-2500 dps.
---
TLDR fuck no. CCP stop reading reddit. thx
---
NS is the #1 reason the game has gone to shit. CCP spent to many years catering to it and then turned it into shit. Now its all shit.
---
And HACs dont use t2 logi cruisers in their fleets?
---
If I had Reddit Gold to give out right now...
---
Losing one dread per week is nbd for people ratting in caps and dreads or mining with rorqs in null-sec. That's assuming you pay for omega using RL iskies rather than krabbing for plex.
---
Broadly,
---
Don't listen to the people who avoid at all costs the core caveat of game design. Let them come and go as they please, and stick to the core ideals of the game. When EVE dies remember it was catering to the people who just wanted to F1 Spod all day that buried it.
---
give black ops BS the ability to cloak and fire anti-cap bombs
---
or don't fire your employees, ever since CCP started mass canning people the game has gone massively down hill.
---
So, to my best knowledge, wormhole object on the entry side is only created when someone warps to the grid for the first time (same as with all anomalies and signatures). At this initialization time, the K162 hidden signature and object is created. I would presume that the K162 object is the one that tracks the time when the K162 should become visible. Any case, this means that the K162 object is not created until the entry side object is created, aka. not before someone warps to the object.Now, if there is a system where no K162 spawns, then no one gets in to that system to activate statics (aka. to warp to the signatures). Now, my assumption is that there are at least some of these systems that do not get any players on a particular day, thus not activating the statics for that day. Question becomes, how many of these systems there are.
---
Of course, there is a small possibility that my understanding is wrong, but we have a lot of experience with closing wormhole systems for operations and so far there hasn't been instance that would have proven above wrong.
---
You couldn't even make it through the step by step tutorial? That should be a warning sign. EVE is a game for the patient.
---
In the name of Bob don't let Hollywood touch the capsuleer side of New Eden. There is no way a high-budget production could capture the spirit of EVE, it's too niche. However something akin to Chronicle adaptation with minor capsuleer involvement could be pretty good. Not that any of this will ever happen anyway.
---
Will probably be Jita after whoever RFed his shit is done.
---
Look since you apparently don't listen to the firesides and its been long enough for them to get leaked I'll recap for you.  They aren't going to be killing people just for being out in a super, they're using it as an opportunity to get them on jabber get them linked into the communication channels so they know what's going on.
---
Soyoufoundme wasn't on comms wasn't in the fireside chat and didn't stop ratting after he was told the hold on supers for the moment.  For those reasons he was commisared by the titans, he knowingly flaunted the rules in the face of the people who set them.  We're not going to hand kills up on a silver platter so hunters think they can just come down into our space for easy kills.  Again every super loss to hunters makes them more likely to try their hand again which just fucks over everyone in our space not just the one that loses their ship.
---
I haven’t been able to get into the right mind to really try to get into it.
---
u/CCP_Falcon Piling on even more.
---
I understand that executing whatever suggestion a player has is a terrible way to run an MMO, but I think it's fair to say that there's a few things in there 95% of us agree on.
---
Please take this long-ass list to someone who cares about the future of the game and pick a few things you can see veterans returning for, as well as a few things new players would like.
---
Much like everybody else there's a few things in there I don't like, but if everything here was implemented it would still be a drastic improvement to the game's long-term health.
---
They never said that it was just going to be for a week.  If you were actually in the communication channels they said give them a week at least but that the time-frame wasn't set in stone.
---
Wow, there is a lot of good changes in this....quite a lot.
---
some bad ones, but some really good ones.
---
You can go a step further than this and burn 10,000km+ and go all the way off grid. This way anyone who sees you insta-undock won't know where you go *after* that, which can matter if someone is trying to track your movements.
---
That's exactly what the blackout did, and I was okay with the risk and adrenaline. Now, i'm just like... WTF? This isn't hard? I'm actually bored making ISK. And if I want to go pvp, people just dock up. So it's also boring. I'm considering ending my omega. Seriously bored.
---
I'm proud, you've matched in two days what I'd usually get in a bit over an hour running lowsec carrier l5s in a similar amount of safety.
---
Can't help you without any details.
---
I wouldn't mind knowing what the bad ones are and why.
---
Sounds like you've identified your problem.
---
That would mean I'd need to do missions to get a lvl 5 agent and that's boring.
---
Just remove fucking stabs. If you want ships with built in stabs, they exist now. They didn't when stabs were invented.
---
Ah I meant fighters, corvettes and such. The things that cant tank.
---
But all I did was orbit and let drones do the work. Big difference.
---
Doubt it.
---
Those aren't going to be main line fleets. The things that can't have a tank built into them aren't used in anything above a 10 man gang or a pure kitchen sink suicide roam.
---
Here is the secret J-space isn't kept in checked by mechanics.
---
People always seem to think that I mean outside of your income often being disconnected so not actively harming you for fighting near home there isn't all that much mechanical reason to fight in wormhole space, the mean reason it happens is because the groups that live there have an intersubjective consensus that fighting is fun so they will generally try and fight 1 and other.  
---
Like the reality is it would be very easy for a blue donut to form in wormhole space from a mechanics perspective, the reason it doesn't is literally that it would end up killing the very reason people moved into wormhole space, to begin with.
---
Now for k-space small groups have been nerfed again and again ( mostly having to do with the income it's nearly impossible for a small group to live well anywhere not sov null in k-space and have decent corp/alliance level income even in wormhole space it often comes down to an honor system to some degree ). 
---
this means small groups have nothing to appeal with and as a result, tend to die off rather quickly or merge, hunting ratters becomes the only viable thing left to do, mostly in larger groups as really 10 dudes are not gonna walk away with kills all that often.
---
Still, 2 days vs 2 hours...
---
Is "Zkil zombie" some sort of killboard fodder joke I'm too competent to understand?
---
Wow. You ratted 2/3rds of a decent Loki in two days.
---
I bow to your money making skills. Please, teach us your secrets.
---
Pearl abyss won EVE guys.
---
After what Hollywood did with Wing Commander and Starship Troopers, hard pass.
---
Well, honestly if they are fitting warp core stabs in the low slots, they are reducing their dps anyways. Also, stop using cancerous kitey ships and use a CN scram like real man.
---
But mine is guaranteed... exploration is chance. Plus, 2 days was about 4 hrs total. So yeah. Loving my little no risk life.
---
Yea, but Loki ratting in a blackout is a hell of a lot more interesting and fun, right?
---
Oh that's a good one
---
Even the stuff I don't necessarily agree with on this would be a hell of a lot better than it is right now.
---
I think the big one is definitely *progression* and the absolute lack of it anymore in EVE. You are 100% right about the map being inverse of what it should be and ultimately anti-content. The middle should be Thunderdome.
---
Highsec should have *no citadels* and only serve as  Noobland on the fringes of the map. Lowsec should be small-medium structures and caps/cynos banned, dump retarded FW system and PVP punishment in the form of sec status hits, this should be an Alpha skill oriented area that has some SoV or SoV/FW mechanics so newer players Alpha or Omega can matter and taste bigger scale combat. Null is where you can find all the big toys and zero restrictions.
---
Right now its Hisec, that area between Hisec and Null, and Null, and nearly nothing really differentiates these areas since its all one big cap umbrella. Sov and Cits are fucking cancer no one really wants to do. Not a wonder why things are stagnant when you do indeed have the biggest groups at the edge of the map just feeding their multi-box ratters with no reason to fight really.
---
\+1 for the good post.
---
Too bad CCP takes AAAAAAGES to execute change by change, at their current rate it will take years to do all of this.
---
This does sound like something for EVE 2
---
In before ccp takes the several terrible ideas and implements them eRa oF ChAOs while ignoring all the ideas they should have come up with and implemented on their own (often years ago) seeing as they are being paid to do this.
---
&gt; So there was no meaningful choice in which T1 frigate to fly; you flew the best frigate you could fly, or you fell into the noob trap of not understanding how convoluted the systems of Eve
---
I covered that
---
Why would you do that? You told me it was risk free.
---
So...tl;dr you want to be able to put shield/armour rigs on your ratting hel/nyx, while not losing out on isk/hr. Gotcha
---
Risk free until I dock up from seeing someone in local. That's the point. Local sucks.
---
never flown a cap but ok
---
Yes, you're onto something here, and this is exactly what's wrong with capital proliferation, Capitals are meant to be weapons of war, nothing more, it's just plain retarded to use them as isk printing machines.
---
Wouldn't be better. Clear Skies captures the spirit of Eve and New Eden better than any Hollywood script could. Pretty graphics and pro actors wouldn't make it better.
---
For the same reason you don't use tanks to farm corn.
---
&gt; By concentrating all of sov null in one spot, it would be easier for a single mega coalition to control all of it.
---
Seems like this didn't stop the big blue Donut most of the time anyway. Sov mechanics would of course need an overhaul too so the underdog has a chance to overcome in ways that don't require just having more Caps than the other guy.
---
How has ccp not called in the lawyers?
---
I don't like the ADM Constellation Change as it really removes the beach head tactic of entry into a region (Normandy). Also removes feigning people into going for a beach head and then jumping on them (Dieppe)
---
Having it Constellation wide I feel makes incursion even harder than it is with Whackamole taking nodes across constellation for one system.
---
I also don't like increasing Cruiser Warp Speed to 4, HACs are a counter to BS, I don't think they should warp 33% faster than them. I think Frig should also be knocked down to 4. BS 3 &gt; BC 3.3 &gt; C 3.5 &gt; Dessie 3.7 &gt; F 4.   
---
I just think having cruisers and frigs at 4 and 5 would be oppressive and return us to the post warp speed changes of Cruisers Online with support Frig Ewar.
---
Who said anything about ratting in it. In two days, you earned 2/3rds of the isk needed to buy a decent PvP Loki.
---
So its not risk free and you lied?
---
Idk if it is an EVE reference the term goon has been around a while
---
SA posters are frequently involved in big game development as well so it would be more likely a reference to that than to Eve goons
---
Remove caps then you can have your battleship fleets again.
---
gf miner show us where the bad catalyst touched you
---
One of the core values of EVE is that nobody is completely safe anywhere, so you need to take steps to protect yourself.
---
Unsure if its been mentioned above, but i suggest trying out spectre fleet or bombers bar, they have a wide range of different fleet comps you show up in the ship  they tell you at a specified time some fleets even have srp. Get your corp involved doing it as a group your getting   experience in  PvP, then afterward you can talk about it in your group. Ez pz..
---
Citadels and sov warfare need properly tied in to each other is the big thing to address. They just kind of dumped overpowered Citadels on top of an already half-baked system of FozzieSov and just kind of...left it like that.
---
Then you haven't seen how broken some wh mechanics really are.
---
I got you fam (kinda)
---
You obviously put a lot of work and some thought into these, and I respect that, but you neglected a lot of needed changes to high sec.  
---
I disagree with your 4/5 abyss removed from high sec because it only nerfs high sec and further benefits nullsec (nobody will do them in lowsec). The risk has never been the hunters waiting for you on the other side, it's the nature of 4/5 sites.
---
People who control moons should have an option to disrupt non allied miners from mining their moons without declaring war (since afk orca are never in corps). 
---
The war HQ timers are also absurd and need to be drastically reduced to make them a viable target during the war duration.
---
It'd be nice to have empire navy function similarly to diamond rats, helping you against gankers if your sec status is high enough for instance and making it more risky for those people to gank in high sec. I understand it's a mechanic and a sandbox thing people do, but it's just too easy and risk free atm.
---
Still, pretty much everything else I agree with. Well done. I doubt it will change anything though.
---
&gt;  And if I want to go pvp, people just dock up
---
Look for something other than krabs then.
---
Tears. Delicious tears. I hate ganking but I honestly can understand the rationale.
---
Thanks man. We really try to stay away from "the news" and stick to stuff that will "hopefully" help people learn more about game mechanics and PvP..... Your comment is a huge compliment :)
---
The issue is, not everyone who had something negative to say about blackout was a bot. In fact, most people who spoke out were not botters in my opinion. The botters keep their heads down and move to highsec.
---
I am always happy to have a principled debate over the merits and downsides to this or that change, but the blackout was an extremely toxic subject.
---
After I lost 1+ Billion losing my training clone twice because the station owners just quit fueling their shit, I just quit using them
---
We really just need a *reason* to use subcaps over capitals. If it was more efficient, that would be the method of defense.
---
Bring back massive jump fatigue. But only for capitals.
---
The attribute system I think was intended to be further developed but just never was, so its just another dead thing in EVE the devs just havn't bothered to do anything else with. Its probably so deeply tied to the skill system it would be a horrible nightmare to change.
---
They do - they just don't use Faxes
---
Sure... like what? Another fleet? Been there. They either dock up as well or get more people in more ships. Sucks to be a small pvp roaming fleeting now, you really don't have the option to re-fit and re-ship. And with local, you're seen 15 jumps away. Plenty of time for a counter fleet to group up against you. At least with the blackout it felt fair and balanced based on everyone's risk. So, try again, bro.
---
Because you can currently light a cyno next an FW acceleration gate, but a gate inside a dead space area you can’t. Angry’s null pve system would a gate in real space.
---
Yes, though Ive seen some of them before but its good to be reminded we've had the fixes for all this dumb shit for a long time now. 
---
Falcon just needs to swallow his pride and listen for a change and quit throwing even more bad ideas at the wall.
---
Risk free means I can avoid anyone at any given time. I won't die... ever. No risk at all.
---
How do you make 500mil an hour in a C3? I'm only making like 250mil or so.
---
Hm, how about giving them more Highs, dedicated to small weaponry and defender-launchers?  
---
You d need real heavy tackle then to actually pin down those things, else the scrammers d get shred by small ACs/Pulses/whatnot. Having local defender-launchers might decrease the effect of actual bombs a tad.  
---
Whats still ridiculous is that a large ship with a larger computer and likely way more sophisticated scanning-systems still needs longer to lock a small ship than another small ship does. Dont really get that logic and IMO it shouuuuld be changed a tad, so that you dont feel like you can make a coffee while your BS tries to lock that Bubbler closing in...
---
Except the boosters mean you can make a puller for a bil without running missions using tags
---
Anyone who actually gets a *fight* in Eve 2k19 has made a mistake somewhere. It's always one-sided dunks or tactical blueballing ops. That's how *winners* play!
---
tl;dr
---
The EveCombatNews Editorial Board would like to recognize u/BothArmsBruised as the 2019 newbro of the year. 
---
Please let us know how we can help make your Eve experience more enjoyable and thank you for bringing your positivity to the game.
---
Agree, all of this would be better than what it is right now. 
---
They're just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks at this point, like for fucks sake listen to us then and try those changes then if we're at *fuck it* anyway
---
but... we're not in malp?
---
just seed dreads retard
---
Legal Expert: The damages must be proven in high bird court prior to being awarded a remedy.
---
Epic coordination needed, to move your eyes to that magical list of names periodically for 3 seconds.
---
This
---
Plot twist: you had cloaky gang.
---
Well, we are literally at "fuck it" if they are now just shotgunning stuff like Blackout just to immediately change it back. What is there to lose by maybe trying some of what OP has stated here instead of more random ass Falconing
---
I said run one, not be in one. Shit truly happens and plenty of people arent in comms right away or dont answer questions as they panic. good pilots die jsut as easily as idiots
---
Yes.
---
No more random BS like Blackout. I've seen good answers for most of these issues over and over. /u/CCP_Falcon you've clearly hit "fuck it" dude, why not try some of our suggestions instead for a while.
---
This probably isn’t the game for you then. The theme parks are that way —&gt;
---
This is a game about setting and striving for your own goals, about building something and possibly getting it blown up. If you can’t be assed to put more than 4 hours of effort in before getting this bored then your gonna struggle. And with more than just this game...
---
I already have plenty of pvp ships... but null pvp lots it's luster and excitement.
---
Yeah, I don't agree with all it perhaps, but I would agree with the raw shakeup regardless. Minor issues can be corrected, it is the major stuff like his suggestions on inverting the map and adding progression back to EVE are the big things that stunted EVEs growth.
---
Hey I just want to say, I noticed your other tweet that made it into the news article about the cool drama. I love it. I just found tool myself and their new album but somehow missed all this drama, lmfao
---
Yeah, you're probably right. I just can't adapt to local. I should just leave the game.
---
500mill... big whoop ... I used to make that in 4 hrs hauling dst loads in hisec with even less risk then what your doing :p
---
Well that's broken. This game's should be called Ease Online.
---
This is probably one of those areas of the game code that hasn't bee touched since like 2004
---
Begging for someone to return a character then shit talking those people. Bold move cotton.
---
Thats easy, restrict Keeps to 1 per region.
---
A group like Pandemic Horde will take player with week one skills and knowledge to fleets. It is a great place to learn. But I understand you want to keep your group together.
---
Horde does now accept corps into the alliance but I am not sure of the requirements for corps to join. It may be that the requirements are fairly high. I'd be trying to get some information on what the entry requirements are.
---
Otherwise take up one of the offers people have PMed you in this thread. You are already a content driver for your group. It sounds like an alliance would be lucky to recruit your group, if only to get yourself.
---
I work for a 3PL, crowdsource me and I will send them 1 pallet of dildos a month until they capitulate to our demands.
---
Just inject m8 lololol
---
You make a damn good point about PVE here.
---
Yea, but null SHOULD have risk. I think that point went way over your head.  I guess I can't expect everyone to figure that out.
---
I like enough of what's suggested here to take the rest I don't like in trade for the overall improvement...and I appreciate your willingness to ask a lot for a lot of people.
---
Updoots for all

---
Head out then .....bro.
---
I think asset safety should be taken out as a Citadel mechanic and reborn as just an account thing you can do if you think you're not coming back for a while, or your account is inactive for long enough (60 days or something). If you do come back you can then retrieve your stuff where you left it or NPC station if the original station no longer exists or you don't have permissions at it anymore.
---
this is old fashioned legislation-writing we don't see anymore anywhere: get enough in there for enough people that they'll all agree overall despite the things they don't like.
---
He isnt, just a number pulled out of his ass
---
one up that.. make anyone with a WCS on unable to lock a target. No tackle.. no dps .. smart bombs/drones aside
---
&gt;You should be able to Quit to the Character selection screen, preventing having to relaunch the session to sign into another character.
---
IIRC CCP has said that they can't do this without rewriting/breaking a lot of things, thanks to Legacy Code.
---
Asset safety should be done in a way with no impact for the attacker in terms of loot and personal losses for the owners/operators so they are worth it to pop.
---
I think AS is a good idea for people taking a break and whatnot, its just implemented in the wrong place.
---
&gt;They could simple have a buttonon the esc screen that has return to char select.
---
The First Rule of Programming is thus: That which is easy to conceptualise is rarely easy to execute. This is no exception.
---
I was *really* hoping Blackout and Invasion was the start of CCP having the balls to actually carry out a map-wide change like this finally.
---
Don’t you dare shit talk Starship Troopers. 
---
It’s a masterpiece.
---
You mean 12k players keeps happening?
---
Stabs only on ships that would logically use those because they normally carry no guns? No way
---
Well... About 75K m³ full of em... That might last a while ;)
---
Is that the Mittani?
---
Depends.
---
Ignoring skill injectors, &gt;15 months to just sit in the hull, plus \~3 months to train the guns, plus \~3-6 months for the other basic skills to actually use it effectively (ie. T2 tank/support, etc.) So \~21-24 months, little under two years. This ignores the skills you'd need to train along the way to be able to pay for the few billion in skillbooks you need (Racial Titan *alone* is six billion), not to mention the ship and fittings themselves, but maybe you can train for the Erebus and use shitfit krabbing ships along the way or use an alt for income.
---
With skill injectors, about 30-60 hours of work, an hour or so to buy PLEX, and then several hundred hours in divorce proceedings and child custody hearings.
---
Start with smaller, more dramatic stories... I m actually sooo fed up with everyone in every movie always saving aaaaall the world, aaaaall the galaxy, aaaaaall everything. Jeeez...
---
He said gold....
---
It is for an art project. I haven't really played the game in years so I don't think I have any ships with the needed marks.
---
Lol that I'll give you.
---
But think about it. From a computer perspective. They could just write a small script to reopen the client once it's closed with x button. But knowing ccp they'll probably break jump drives or something as a result
---
A minor detail
---
He’s just shit posting.
---
You seen the state the Griffin Navy Issue is in? geezuz
---
This. Honestly.
---
I'd be down for a eve movie but I feel a b movie would hit the note better than a list Hollywood.. and even then it would be really hard to make it interesting to none eve players.. cuz it would just be more starwars in space but with an eve backdrop. Altho it would still probably be better than this new generation of starwars.
---
Krabs think the most dangerous space in eve should be the safest. They’re shit like that. And they probably talk shit about people that AFK mine in high sec and bitch about carebears.
---
This would be interesting something that covers the empires maybe before capsules were a thing?
---
Bridging subcaps might become the norm unless you bring back massive jump fatigue for all ships.
---
Players like you think about everything in terms of ISK. Before you undertake to do something you always do a cost benefit analysis. If it's not profitable, it's not worth doing. 
---
And you discount the existence of other players. To one such as you, the Hulk is the obvious choice for a mining op, since it has the best yield. You carefully plan how you will protect it from the NPC rats, project the ISK/hr you will earn with it, and arrange an Orca to boost it and collect the jetcans. And then it gets ganked! What gives?
---
Ganking a Hulk is obviously a waste of time since the cost of the gank will exceed the value of the T2 loot it will drop. The numbers just don't add up. Your imagination does not include a scenario where somebody would willingly throw ISK away just to destroy one.
---
Nonetheless, there are many of us who joyously gank such targets knowing full well that it won't turn a profit. Are we just perverse? Or could we have different motivations that do not include ISK?
---
Hulks draw gankers from ten jumps out, and here's the reason: the idea of an expensive, vulnerable symbol of greed sitting out hoovering up ore while *assuming* he will be left alone is repugnant to us. Its presence is an affront to all that is good. It is begging to be ganked. So we destroy it and feel satisfaction in having done our part to improve the universe. We are sending the pilot a clear message.
---
The message is that one should never expect to be *left alone* in EVE. Obsession with the gradual accumulation of ISK is for carebears and bot-aspirants. The real fun of EVE is in the interactions with other players. As the tagline goes: "Build Your Dreams, Wreck Theirs."
---
O7
---
1Bn an hour is pretty hard to get in WHs unless you have a dread, and dreads are very vulnerable, particularly in static connections where the majority of krabbing happens.
---
I get that it's a pain in the ass if you can't escalate but I wholly believe that if three or four dudes are willing to throw carriers fit for dealing with subs they should be able to fight off a fleet comp worth equally as much idk.
---
It's [Current Year], people still don't flair up?
---
Who looks at the current state of nullsec and thinks, "yes, even *more* advantage to the defender is what we need!"
---
TBH that sounds kinda fun, in an ominous sort of way.
---
There aren't only 10 supers in EVE.
---
Scratches head: nc in nsi now?? Ummm vince lol
---
Ah I see u have salt mining VI already
---
Btw sorry, seems my formatting is having issues, going to try to fix it.
---
If you dock up you wont make any isk
---
To explain (and apologies if this is patronising), warp speed is one of the biggest limiting factors in ratting income while flying a Super. 
---
Warp speed rigs are standard equipment for these ratting ships, as you increase your very slow warp speed by ~40%. But this comes at the cost of tank rigs. 
---
An ihub upgrade would let ratters have the best of both worlds.
---
Once again, apologies for being patronising.
---
&gt;But knowing ccp they'll probably break jump drives or something as a result
---
It's not even a case of "CCP incompetence". CCP has already said that because of how spaghettified Legacy Code is, this is a feature they can't implement without breaking a lot of things. They can only work with what they have, and what they have is a client that was written in Python.
---
r/agedlikemilk
---
&gt;Are EVE players really expected to throw away countless hours so that eventually they land a fight?
---
Yes. Or ping warrior and let someone else so it. Most seem okay with that
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*

Remove the code block. Just regular text with two spaces and two newlines at the end of each paragraph.
---
The game is really different now a days. When I lived in null about 4 years ago, pvp definitely came to you. The alliance I was in had everyone serve gate guard and boy were you busy. Keeping reds out was a job and a half. But then again super cap fights were far more infrequent. It was something to see someone bring out a titan, to hear about one fight that escalated. Now-a-days things seem quieter. There is a lot more subterfuge and a lot less full on confrontation.
---
And with respect that excuse is the same reason why poses couldn't be upgraded or changed but oh wow they made citidels.. nothing in a program is isolated I know this. Hell I'm not even arguing it would be easy beyond a hotfix like script I mentioned as it would only prompt the launcher to re launch the client that was already active. And since the launcher rework this is probably a bit harder than I'm making it out to be. My point here is it's a half ass reason now if they said hey we're not doing it because fuck you then fine. Or even be honest we don't want to put the money into it. Fine just say it and don't use spaghetti code as an excuse because any decent programmer with enough time can figure it out it's just a matter of money and effort.
---
As I mentioned to another it's extremely likely that it's programmer oversight when they originally build the game engine eve runs on.
---
I'm not saying it's easy or even that they should. Just give us a better reason than because spaghetti.. cuz if that's there reason for that some changes can't happen maybe it is time we moved to a eve 2.0
---
Oh and once apon a time they said 64 bit was never gunna happen.. guess what..
---
On the subject of balance changes, I think CCP should force a minimum of one balance change per patch. 
---
Even if it's a tiny insignificant balance change. 
---
The point is to have iteration become a cultural norm within the community and the company. Grease the rails. Then there'll be less inertia to overcome when doing bigger balance changes.
---
No problem!
---
I can't wait to go try this (I've never really mucked around with the battleships). Thanks!
---
I expect that it's difficult to hire engineers in a tiny country like Iceland. Getting work done is going to be a slow and difficult process. Free ideas are nice and all, but there's a lot of truth to the saying '1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.'
---
There is generally constant pvp opportunities for those fighting the blobs. You can pick when and where to fight and because you are fighting a blob there are always targets. 
---
Good places to set up shop. NPC Delve/Fountain/Stain
---
I'm not complaining!
---
Is there such a thing as insignificant balance change?
---
Please try posting this is in our mega thread. Thanks!

It would be nice if devs actually play. Some of them haven't logged into tranq in years. They think they understand what's going on but they don't. A few GM's transporting bots into high sec for a kill isn't what I mean. Pay the devs to spend one week actually playing the game. 40 hours of playing to see through the eyes of a paying customer.
---
Thanks for the help, still can't get it to indent the way it's supposed to but hopefully its easier to read now

# Blackout:
---
Use of the existing Constellation and Region chat channels. Pretty straight forward a compromise between the two extremes. You get *vague* intel. You get the feeling of space being populated.

Not new at all. I posted about it a month ago.

Didn't even know that existed, Do you want me to post the link or just copy paste it? Reddit formating and I don't get along very well
---
There's no indenting. Quotes and dot-points are your alternatives.
---
Copy paste should work. Formatting on comments and posts is the same.
---
Overall I think thats the biggest problem, but I also think hubris is also a bigger problem. you don't need words to see whats going on behind the scenes.
---
    Tristan hull strength increased by 1.
---
I'd say so, yes.
---
This was sort of the thing the blackout was trying to fix.  In any system of mechanics, perfect Intel means if both sides aren't completely retarded, the side that knows they are going to lose is going to opt not to take the fight, unless it's over something incredibly important, and when that happens they'll usually have it timed in a timezones where they're stronger than you, and then you'll be the one that chooses not to lose.

   Earlier this year final fantasy 14 released it’s most recent expansion called Shadowbringers. While hearing about this expansion I stumbled upon a documentary from noclip about how final fantasy 14's early failure nearly killed square and how they brought one of squares worst released games back from the brink of death to make it the second most successful MMO of all time and it made me realize Eve’s biggest problem and why eve is destined to die unless CCP heed the lessons from square and other developers to who learn this lesson the hard way. 
---
   
---
*    When the initial release of FF14 came out the game started out with a lot of hype until people started to realize that the game just started to become un-fun for a lot of people save for a few diehard fans. **With square-enix facing a very bad failure they pulled some of their top employees to figure out how to save the game,  Naoki Yoshida, was made part of a special task force to fix FF14. As part of his task force he identified one of the key problems was part of the management team could do no wrong which prevented them from seeing the problems with their own ideas. He wound up urging the CFO at the time to think about restructuring the company to allow for fresher ideas which the company did and put Naoki in charge of FF14 and he was given 2-3 years to fix the game.**
---
  When he sat down and played the original game he realized there were a lot of major issues that couldn’t be fixed with just patching the game. So part of his plan to fix the mmo was to rebuild the game from scratch while at the same time fixing as many of the glaring problems with the game, making it fun to play adding a lot of QoL changes and ensuring that the game was fun and enjoyable for their fans. Eventually after a lot of hard work they released to rework known as a realm reborn and the rest is history with its success. What makes this the best comeback story is that their failure made them rework their scheduling structure to ensure that they managed every aspect of the game so that every three - four months they release patches that add new content including new story elements and adjust/balance certain jobs and classes. While working on fresh new expansions that add to the sotre. With each patch they are willing to go back and back fill and fix quests that might turn off new players and balance out classes so that if one class is getting used less they buff it to ensure that all classes are bviable.
---
**So why do I bring this up?**
---
   CCP for a long time has done nothing to innovate and show respect for its player base, this shows in their “latest iteration” chaos era where it looked more like contempt for their player base than respect from the outside looking in. I’d go as far as to say their past installments have been intentionally pushing people more into addiction gameplay by making the game more grindy in all aspects of the game to keep people hooked to eve thus making it feel like as a player you had to log in just to keep up in this game. spend more and more money with injectors and plex. We talk about citadels, we talk about cynos, we talk about enticing content and ship tiericide and balance and none of this stuff has actually been touched except to push extremes that can be turned on and off with a switch when in actuality Eve needs an overhaul.
---
  **So what needs to happen with CCP to fix eve?** 
---
  **Over all CCP needs to accept their mistakes and be willing to restructure their development teams to take stubborness and hubris out of the design process, and they need to focus their company to a point where new ideas and fresh changes and new direction can be applied to eve's future.**
---
  **What this entails?**
---
* \* Restructure the company to accept new ideas with Developers who love eve
---
* \* Come up with a full list coming from a project lead who plays the game from a fresh perspective, for all aspects of the game.
---
* \* Rebuild eve from the ground up, Eve needs a rework.
---
* \* Come up with an awesome story set that entices the players with not only pve and pvp, hell have the drifters build a new gate that forces all the capsuleers forward in time or something like that. Just something that feels more than one guy writing lore entries on their free time.
---
* \* Fix the issues with the game, Continue fixing the quality of life issues, and the UI 
---
* \* REDUCE THE GRIND, this does not only entail pve, but pvp as well. A less grindy core gameplay will help a lot to keep new players and old players alike.
---
* \* SHIP BALANCE,SHIP BALANCE, SHIP BALANCE. You need to balance all ships for different play styles, like in turn you shoul buff the speed of some brawly ships and reduce some kitey, also T3C’s need to lose covert ops cloaks if they are going to be that powerful. And booshing ships need to have a similar capacity reduction mechanic akin to titans using their doomsdays. Speaking of dooms days, titan doomsdays need to use more fuel but have less cargo space which reduces the amount of times they can use the doomsday. Supers should lose light fighters but should have the ability to use a boosh, while getting a reducing to EHP. and there is a lot more that could be done here but I am not an eve expert but I have some ideas on balance.
---
* \* Eve needs a refresh, but not an eve 2. Overall you can call it what you want but eve needs an overhaul to bring back the fun factor for both pve and pvp. But making a new game entails making a new game, Making an overhaul of the game can use both aspects of eve so new iterations in this current version of eve can be ported to a new version of eve without harming player enjoyment and allowing the fixing of issues.
---
**TLDR : CCP Needs to adapt the lessons learned from final fantasy 14 devs in order to save eve. Until this happens eve will never ever get back to the numbers it had before citadels came out. A Developer that respects its player base that stick with them is a developer that earns the money they get.**
---
  *Also I know i’m not anyone important as I stopped playing eve in january but this is my takeaway as to what the player base really needs to focus their IRE on. Not nullbears, Not risk adverse gankers, Not small gang, not null blocks. The players are not the enemy here, CCP’s hubris is, and that hubris needs to change to humility and putting the nose to the grinder to get it done to save eve.* 
---
Feel free to bash me but this is just my take away from what I think eve needs.
---
Agent Smithvirus - ex - eve player  
---
Moved from my original post - Lesson's CCP can learn form square-enix
---
Replace null anoms with escalation-style sites that require you to travel between systems. Gate them so caps and supers can't get in. Add more scram/web rats so that hunters have a chance to catch unprepared ratters.
---
Try smaller gang stuff. Or just join a standing fleet of Pandemic Horde or Provi and fight off all the smallgangs
---
someone else made the kicking over someone else sandcastles point. its not something i have ever tried, but i understand griefing is something that happens in any game because someone find joy in the activity. Sandboxes are unique that it often rewards the griefer too
---
&gt; Highsec
---
&gt;2 Sansha incursions restored
---
The removal of multiple incursions damaged the highsec incursion community, which is one of it's better parts.
---
&gt;Ability to open L4/L5 abyssals removed
---
Too safe in highsec.
---
Bit of dissonance here? High sec too safe but buff high sec?
---
I copy pasted it in there.
---
Try a smaller group? I'm not seeing dull fleets after I moved to a wormhole group but can definitely relate when I was in Horde.
---
Alternatively we can do a suggestion day where we let all these types of threads through. Other days we would remove them. If this ends up being a bad idea we will simply not do it going forward. Hopefully this thread (and week) gives a clear picture.
---
For the record: This is our number 1 most requested 'feature'. It's also one of the most contentious so we're just going to just test this and see how it goes.
---
Then risk something other then your cheaply fit ... whatever your using, get into a hel and see how much you can make “risk free”
---
Ping warrior checking in. You gotta be Johnny on the spot though, otherwise you get left behind.

Concentrate them into a megathread. I doubt everyone wants to constantly tell the new people to wait until Mondays to post crappy ideas.
---
Hmm, that seems to be what I'm saying, unless you are replying to someone I have blocked.

Then you shouldn't have any issue giving out the name of the system you rat in.

---
Oh, for the days when I'll finally be able to play with you guys like that. Alas, I am neither rich nor space-rich, but such is life.
---
u/CCP_Falcon 
---
Glomming on even more. I want to see CCP thinking big and acting bold. There's a lot of urgently good ideas in this post.
---
I dont think HD images exist. Solution:
---
Step 1, Buy minmatar ship
---
Step 2, Buy another ship on an alt that isnt a shuttle or noob ship.
---
Step 3, Blow up said ship with minmatar ship on main.
---
Step 4, Admire newly acquired minmatar kill mark.
---
This sounds great, but in practice would provide better intel to ratting pockets, especially those with a only one or two entrances.
---
I don't think they know what to to now. Did you read the post-Blackout 'dev blog'? They basically called the players a bunch of pussies.
---
They created the current player base by the last few years of catering to safety first mentality and now have to figure out what to do next given their new reality.
---
Leshak fit?
---
CSM this days is more like prestige thing for big alliances rather than true community representatives.
---
Most of them got elected because of votes of their alliance/coalition members, who didn't dig too much about how good their game knowledge or vision, and instead voted by lists given by their alliance leadership.
---
Most of changes that today considered bad for game (citadels, rorq mining) was made with CSM elected like that.
---
You overestimate CSM meaning, they are not too much better than other players who posting their suggestions on this reddit.
---
That being said, it is known that CSM don't have too much influence on developers, but something tells me that when no fatigue jump bridges on keepstars , or rorq buff got introduced they wasn't as against it as they was against blackout :)
---
Yes indeed. Which means those pockets become more valuable to hold, and become a more frequent target for ganks.
---
There was local in MH when gunpoint diplomacy was around and I remember you being successful then. It's not local, it's the change of the playerbase to total pussies.
---
 Asset safety has hard value limit per system. The current station value + asset safety limit is visible to docked characters. Hangers can be exempted from this display, but are not covered by asset safety.
---
It would make docking up on red worse for sure. Instead of people docking once you hit system, they'll be docking as soon as you're 3 jumps out. 
---
Bringing blackout back + reworking anoms to include gates and restricted combat zones (along the lines of abyssal sites, preferably with the need to leave via an exit gate instead of warping straight out) would provide an interesting balance between hunters and ratters. Ratters might see them on d-scan and start trying to rush the exit, hunters have to try and get in and land tackle before they get there.
---
I haven't logged in for over 2 years, but in the 15 years I played Eve, across every possible style of gameplay, hisec shenanigans were by far my favourite. I had plenty of good times in lowsec, null and wormholes, from FCing small gangs to sov war to solo/duo in a C2 to Eve Uni.  Nothing else provided the consistent, reliable fun and challenge of murdering miners, industrials and freighters in hisec and the metagame surrounding that.
---
You've had all the reasons explained. If you've never done it you can't understand. Even if you do it, it might not be for you. That's fine - just keep your permit up to date and accept that different people like different things.
---
TIL that blowing up ships in a ship blowing up game makes you an asshat
---
It really depends the group you are with and where you are in EVE. Maybe its time for a change of pace. Groups like No Vac (wormholes), United Federation of Conifers (small null sec group), and ORNGC (small lowsec group) get content fairly frequently.
---
There is too much people in big blue coalitions
---
Where could be 10 alliances who having fun fights with each other every day, there is 1 or 2 huge coalitions, that most of time blob their opponents to the point they just don't want to even undock, or (rarely) having terrible lagging tidi experience fighting another coalition.
---
Why is that? I guess we (eve players) just love each other too much, and just want to be friends instead of all this war stuff :)
---
Show me on the Retriever where CODE touched you
---
Nerf highsec solo, buff highsec groups. The incursion communities may not go on drunk fleets together but they are communities none the less.
---
FCs are important but it’s the content creators that make or break a corp. People who *know* how to induce a fight. If you’re in a corp without any, maybe find one that gets fights :)
---
i have friends where i’m at, ive thought of it, but the people you play with make the game what it is. i usually just make routes or hunt through wh space if hole pops up
---
Being ganked is literally good for retention. Look up the CCP stats.
---
**--Example 1-**  Generates: GATE CAMPS.... new roaming ways, shortens up time to "find le PvP from Jita/Hek/othertradehub" (ideally).  
---
**--Example 2-** Add some deadspace/faction drops from NPCs in the area and higher chance of officer spawn and you got PvP contested content for small gangs.  
---
**--Example 3-** Make mining lasers/exhumers/other mining tools inflict damage and witness first battle of miners... if it will be profitable enough. "Venture blobs" might become a thing and using mining laser to not only destroy, but mine minerals from the enemy ships. Suicide mining fleets appear.  
---
**--Example 4-** Oh look, another unfair PvP button (people will find a way to bait against a bigger fleet, this will lead to all sorts of good content and tears)... But chance is miners won\`t quit their home systems just because it is safer and more afk-ish.  
---
**--Example 5-** I smell mining ball leading warping "effort". Pings to mine...  **\*meme mode on\*** attempts to use MWD/warping Avatar to ram asteroids and push them all way through to the other gate to make small warpable corridor for smaller ships. **\*meme mode off\***  
---
**--Example 6-** People are tryhards, constellation should also cancel discord/TS/mumble and so on... but jumping three times as long can make those systems a valuable spot for cyno drops... leading to content.  
---
**--Example 7-** DED 11/10?  
---
**--Example 8-** Never happens. CCP takes F-O-R-E-V-E-R to introduce new tier of ships. We have angel titan concept that looks quite lewd but nobody gives a F and here you ask for T3 BS? It is more realistic to make CCP Hilmar (in triglavian coat) appear on Jimmy Fallon\`s show and reveal drifter skill and ship blueprints and/or meaningful SOV changes and/or proper PvE system with 13 cinematic story arcs of blizzard quality for each storyline (gallente/caldari/amarr/minmatar) so we learn more about New Eden via storyline worthy of mass effect/dragon age/witcher...
---
DELETE STABS. PROBLEM SOLVED.
---
Having a poo.
---
I dont understant the analogy. You use the Carrier to destroy hostile ships and it doesnt matter If they are npc or player
---
Change anoms from the waves of small ships that basically acts a horde basically to fewer, stronger, more intelligent ships. Have them use the diamond rat AI to behave as a fleet, have ships warp out if not tackled, let the rats scram/point/web the player, etc. Force the player to be more active while ratting and need to fit scrams/other ewar to be successful.
---
&gt; Like, several people here specifically mention they do it for the salt. As in they are ganking specifically because they know it will make someone angry. Why is this a good thing? Why is people being angry at you a good thing?
---
Personally I want them to be mad at me, hunt me, hire mercs to kill me, organise resistance, try to exact revenge any way they can. That's content for me and for them. Everyone wins.
---
But some people value slowly accumulating ISK over seeking out actual content. That's fine (even though I can't imagine anything duller), but you're still my content.
---
And allow ship ramming to do damage.
---
&gt;  Our moderator team will be removing threads suggesting changes/improvements to the game, and directing members to post them here. 
---
Best idea I have seen on r/EVE in months.
---
I actually made \[a post on the official forums\]([https://forums.eveonline.com/t/the-problem-with-eve-online-is-a-matter-of-perception/189810/30](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/the-problem-with-eve-online-is-a-matter-of-perception/189810/30?u=valiran_teleros)) about two potential tutorial missions involving the player being ganked; one on a gate and one using CODE. tactics.
---
I still want them to put some NPC null in between the empires, as they stand.
---
That only makes your case even worse.
---
Just give up while you're behind, dude.
---
I once had to deal with an antiganker in a Blackbird. Full rack of Gallente jammers, making life hard for our Catalysts. We theorycrafted a bunch of ways to deal with it and eventually, after training new skills for days and trialling different fits, we ganked it in 0.5 with 2 ECCM Cormorants. That wasn't a dank killmail by any means, but it was such sweet content. The Code always wins. Always.
---
wtf I love the mods?
---
This sub: "LEL hisec miner ganking = dank tears! eat shit pubbie!"
---
Also this sub : "Blackout nullsec miner ganking is bullshit! I'm not your CONTENT!"
---
Unreal.
---
&gt; in my coalition 
---
This is why there is no content for you... Think of nullsec like  well orchestrated theater performance. On the surface it seems like a interesting story but it's really a planned, staged show. All the actors know each other, the blood is fake and everyone is just following a script. Plus the average person is just a F1 backup dancer and the Lead in one play is the lead in most.  Not much is going to happen outside of this unless someone makes a mistake and forgets their lines, when that does happen though the improv will be short lived. 
---
This is what is killing the fun aspect of pvp. The predictability of everything. 
---
I started eve 10 years ago. Left for 4 years and came back for the shakeup. Was in a coalition that is part for the FRT war but tbh it boring as fuck. Now I am in a wormhole with a null sec static that can be rolled for content and tbh the game is interesting again. Few evictions a week, fights and with changes to how many WH there are some unpredictability. The unpredictability (in contrary to what people want to believe) is what makes the game exciting. I think WH's will be its final resting place, (with nullsec scripted and no room for new actors,) as now everyone wants it all safe , predictable and able to be determined before anything happens. 
---
In summary , you can have good content, be a FC or relegate yourself to surfdome as a F1 monkey. You just can't have all 3.
---
This may have just been a side effect of the nano epidemic.
---
As somebody who lives in null, my experience with small WH comps such as the one you describe is that they will be so super kitey that almost nothing will catch them. And if you do bring one of the few things that can, they simply bolt immediately and reroll their null static.
---
So your choices are to either undock something that is sure to die while not being and to pin anything down long enough to kill it... Or form something that could potentially work, and get blue balled for your efforts.
---
Eventually you just get tired of this and go do some RL chores or something whenever such a comp shows up. Actually trying to fight it is an exercise in futility.
---
NIH syndrome has killed a bunch of companies.
---
If no1 wants to fight you it’s probably because your alliance has gained a reputation for blobbing, what fleets do you run? If you come up against a smaller group do you try to ship down to get a fight? Or bring close to even numbers?
---
Having lived around fw for 10 plus years I’ve learned you need to join in the dance to get people to fight you just going round curb stomping people will dry up your own content.
---
Have you tried talking to opposing FC’s or alliance Corp leaders about the fights/ the bashing of structures? And the chance of getting content from them?
---
i am very biased. silly goons trying to ruin the game.
---
i don't like that judy mod, he's a real funny fella y'dig?
---
Realtalk this sub is making me want to resub all 4 accounts just to gank in hisec.

I wish CCP would respond to this post to see if they even care.

Long time EVE winner. This showed up randomly on my feed.   Holy cow, I'm gonna need two showers!

Well done. CCP, make it so!
---
Depends on your reasons behind the blowing up of said ships; but potentially yes, it does. Welcome to Eve?
---
So I try to be a Fc some times and what i can say is 
---
You normaly shoot the support stuff first such things like : huggins and Lachesis 
---
After them it depends on the enemy Fleet comp normaly you try to get DPS from the grid but if you cant kill enemy DPS ships you first try to shoot some logis

holy warp speed power creep batman!

buff scram and long point to 7-8 disruption strength, give indies warp core stability  bonus per level
---
Nah we hate each other, but big coalitions bring safety and order. Humans love those two things. Thats also the reason why eve will die as soon as you go after those two things too hard. The rioters and aggressive players are mostly gone or got calmer and also looking for calmer playstyles. New blood will be extremely hard to find since there are now so many other options for games to play. 
---
I myself dont have hours each day to spent. I am working and have other responsibilities. Take away from me what i enjoy in eve and i go too.
---
Come find us and we can shoot each other, we're a filthy degenerate C4 corp.
---
&gt; Welcome to Eve?
---
Thanks. 15 years late, but still appreciated.
---
To be fair, fighting competent nano pilots is cancer and just going to result in you being kited to death while you can't actually kill anything. I'd probably tell your gang to fuck off or just bring something equally cancer like jackdaws or cerbs.

CCP wont even read this

Still a couple years back CCP was dead serious about  Eve Online TV series (google for it).  Ridley Scott was (allegedly) supposed to be the producer, and it was going to be the next GoT.

I don't agree with all of these changes, a lot of people won't. I wouldn't appreciate many of them being implemented, and most of these miss the pain points of eve as they speak from a current  &amp; veteran player view, rather than not-a-player view (new acquisition is the problem). Also the community manager isn't a server, though they absolutely need to connect their team with these ideas. I wouldn't be so rude and fatalist.

Remove local, remove covert cloaks, remove rorq mining, remove citadels
---
Because we don't heave meaningful targets to hit. CCP has made citadels so safe nobody wants to fight over them. There's no strategic targets to hit because none of them matter. So fleet fights are basically because "lol 4 fun we're bored" when they do happen but in most cases are avoided unless you know you'll win.

t3c can be unkillable if tank fit, are you out of your mind? a t2 fit legion fitted for tank can push over 200k ehp while being nullified

Wait...is our deployment over already?

Two blingy snakes get fairly close. Around 150-200m each on a good day til you run out of sites.

It's fun blowwing people's stuff up. When you have billions of ISK throwing away some 10mil catalysts to race Concord and kill some mining barges is just fun for a while. Not a LONG while mind you but the first ten times it's kind of cool...

&gt;In non-blackout eve, every fight is a mistake.

To quote mittens and its the common eve feeling right now.

Blueball or hyperdunk.  No middleground. No good fights.
---
Uhhhhhhh
---
You're doing Eve wrong .
---
Nice comp.  I miss those days when you'd actually get a fight worth showing up for
---
Join a smaller alliance, they tend to fight more often as the members are more willing to commit to what it takes to go around and find a fight. Or do rapid response for tackled krab ships and encourage your local krabs to fit some extra tank so you can get to them in time.
---
In some unicorn places you'll find the ability to do both.
---
Being in a megacoalition is an *extremely* poor place to actually find fights. They're great for boring endless fleets in exchange for safety for your Rorquals, and that's about it. Any megacoalition that tells you otherwise is likely lying to you.
---
As typical, some of your suggestions I like. But many of them are deal breakers that would just reinforce my decision to win Eve
---
 "In non-blackout eve, every fight is a mistake. "  
---
And blackout was better how? All blackout meant was you couldn't see the cloaked recons and bombers about to warp in and shit all over you trying to take an even fight that was actually bait.
---
I have personally taught one of my gank victims how to do it, and they told me they were going to quit from boredom until I killed them. So while your butthurt generalisations might be partly accurate, they aren't as universal as you might think.
---
Meta for what playstyle though?
---
I read like how you didn't read my post at all
---
Toxic actually is pretty good about fighting. Almost never uses cynos, even coverts, and pretty much never blobs (relatively speaking I suppose, but still). Been pleasantly surprised by you guys.
---
I agree with joining a small corp or a group that does small gangs. Hell maybe you could grab some friends to roam with within your existing corp. You can always find a heart racing fight no matter your ship and no matter your group size. Solo or 100 people, if you know where to look, content can always be found.

For your citadel FW change to work you'll have to remove ACLs for it to work otherwise corps would just enroll placeholder corps into the opposite faction and give themselves access.
---
Next time please spend a few minutes per suggestion thinking about how it would be played around.
---
My old corp dropped a Fax, carrier, 2 dreads, and a squad of caracals on a nana loki fleet (50) and only when the fax dropped could we really do anything to apply damage.
---
Remove asset safety and injectors.
---
Stopped reading after first 2 points of "remove consequences".

Small alliance drama is way better than megacoalition drama. Feels like the Eve of old.
---
I'd love to read a full report of the Tribute/Vale alliances interactions. Battle reports, structure kills, territorial movements. I've seen some of it and I feel like most of it isn't being talked about at all, even here where pretty much even the least interesting content is still posted.
---
There's so many perspectives that a comprehensive report might not be possible, but still.
---
No, you are completely free to play the game the way you want to, can't stop you. Won't stop you.
---
However, by your own admission, you do what you do because it makes people angry at you. Because it makes people upset, because you enjoy "the salt". You(and/of others) have said so numerous times in this very thread.
---
You are deliberately trying to upset someone, why? I literally want to understand what it is that drives people to stuff like this.
---
I mean, I am going to assume that out of game you don't go out of your way to upset random strangers, so what is it about Eve that makes you act the way you do.
---
P2W arena. No thx
---
Wow, you're such an edgy badass dude.
---
No really, you really scare me with how bad ass you are.
---
Because none of you have answered the questions. Why do you enjoy making people angry? I don't understand it, you (ostensibly) don't act this wa in real life, so why act this way in a game?
---
can i get your things?
---
It's because of the scale man, a hundred man fleet could've been ten ten-man fleets having an actual chance at decent times
---
Get an old rusty piece of metal, put two strips of duct tape on it in a chevron shape, paint it glow-in-the-dark, and bam. Minmatar killmark.
---
(Legit answer: https://eve-nt.uk/designer/ lets you customize ship appearance and you can add killmarks.)
---
I wonder, why is it that most of these healthy ideas will not be implemented by CCP - at all?
---
I understand that CCP is the sole developer, it is their game, but the direction these ideas carve out must be a direction CCP would like to go, at least, more or less. If not, why?
---
Thanks! Idea and suggestion posts are the worst, except maybe 1 per week.

Google a bit, you should finda tutorial. Remeber to fix models before importing them into your slicer, if you want to 3d print them.

The game itself is a massive waste of time
---
Go read a book, go on to a field trip, meet more people, have a good meal, work ou... just a sec, received a ping, fc you need a logi anchor?
---
Ok but they also have to stop in Huddersfield
---
why should suicide gankers not be able to be intercepted then? They abuse concord to prevent real pvp and get no effort killmails.
---
&gt; I hope you all understand what this means, because I don't have time to explain it.
---
it means you gotta pump those numbers up, rookie
---
When you are part of large block, you cannot expect anything else. Leave the blob and have fun in almost every fleet.
---
I quit the game in 2013 and just came back. I want battleships and combat inty's to be useful again. Other than that I'm having a blast.
---
Have less blues, then there will be people to fight.

&gt; undocked
---
Seems far fetched
---
The PvP that "comes to you" in today's Eve is largely a micro scale of how big alliances fight each other - blueball or helldunk. Either you get hard ganked in your krab ship by way more than you can muster to fight them, or nothing happens at all while they kite away from you and bitch in local.
---
This is kind of different in space held by smaller groups, though it still happens often enough to suck.
---
They already do so with current intel channels regionwide. But constellation channels would make cloaky campers more annoying
---
Remove rats targeting ewar if the ewar is targeting a player ship and not a rat.
---
We still have enough culture to shit on toonies in their thannies , making iskies, waving o7. It's a losing battle though.
---
Later wont happen. You cant bring sonething like that out of the game anymore
---
Multiply by 2 the couldowns of anomalies and moon mining extraction time so that NS alliance have to spread a lot more.
---
I doubt even the former will happen but still
---
Remove CSM, remove asset safety, remove excavators, introduce medium (for Orcas) and heavy (for Rorquals) mining drones that would outmine current mining drones by at least 15-20%, revert cyno changes but make capitals and interceptors unable to fit a cyno, remove ore anomalies and make them signatures again, give black ops d-scan immunity, bring back AT, introduce new AT ships for niches that haven't been used yet (covert ops interdictor, hull repair logi, faction marauder)
---
Join a corp

EvE is very hard for true solo

Some information is slightly out of date. But by and large it has useful information.
---
I stated blue loot income to C5 and C6.        
---
Small groups will be largely unaffected, huge WH blocks will be hit hard.
---
Tbh i see those as a warp stabs, but as a simple fact that ship of with a size od a small moon cannot be simply pointed and hold in place by a ship with a size of a bus.            
---
On top of this we have dictors, hictors ...      
---
Honestly i am totally fine to add those to capitals **but only if you will not be able to PVE in them so effectively like now**
---
I don’t know what you are going on about but the CSM is made up of people from all over the game, not just “ten from one alliance”
---
Once again, i blame citadels. It simply wasnt that possible to evade gangs as most systems didnt have anything to dock in. Reds had easier times to catch something and defs were ready for these situations and were able to form up quite fast. And even if you docked up, there could be some instalocker on undock and just blab you. These days, there are 10 bulshit tethering asses in each system even in the poorest aliances.
---
"Fleet vs fleet"
---
Dude, get a gang together, not a fleet, and travel to someone's territory you hate. Call them a bunch of pussy's in local and then let them put a gang together. Works best if your guys are flying the kitchen sink, people love those type of fights.
---
The first at least has a chance. But before that i hope they iterate on structures as a whole. Reduce timers and make them easier to kill . 48 hours after reinforcing first timer and 24 for 3. 
---
Let the defender choose time of day and attacker the day itself. I heard that small structures shouldnt have timers but that would be extremely unfair to smaller entities who cant afford fortizars. But low power should be killed at max in 2 days.
---
First off: Don't be AFK.
---
Second: Because it's fun. Go do it sometime.
---
You do not need to run something personally to be intimately acquainted with the failure of people.
---
People fuck up, that always happens. But if you are not incompetent it should be easy to deal with, esp. if the FAXs are on standby
---
Sure but it's still incredibly biased towards the blocs with the most people in them.
---
&gt; Why do you enjoy making people angry?
---
So far, nobody has said that is the reason they gank.
---
The ganking is fun, and irrational carebear tears, while not a goal whatsoever, can be entertaining themselves.
---
http://minerbumping.com
---
carebears say ridiculous crap.
---
It's pretty simple really. The vast majority of people don't want to fight; they want to win, myself included most of the time.
---
When you bring 5 of something, they bring 10.
---
When you bring 5 mil fits, they bring 10 mil fits/drugs.
---
When you bring 5, they bring 5 of it's counter.
---
In my own experience, the best way to get a fight is to either:
---
A. Force It (Nullsec #1 bubbles)
---
B. Bait It (make them think they have the advantage)
---
B#1. Bait It (make them think it's a fair fight and be the better pilot)
---
Ultimately, the core problem with PvP in our beloved sandbox is that PvP is punished either by loss or opportunity cost, and PvE is rewarded. CCP needs to come up with a System that better rewards PvP in areas such as nullsec. 
---
Ultimately CCP needs to find a replacement for the old Moon Mining System (without returning to that particular system) and its way of generating fights by rewarding PvP and punishing inaction (IE Carebear Stare).
---
It shouldn't have taken them 5 catalysts. Hulks are really weak.
---
got a better idea, how about you stop proposing ideas on things you don't understand
---
The problem with this proposal is that it assumes that a Change Request has more value than a `keep things as they are` Request. It implicitly penalises maintaining the status quo because status-quo requests don't exist in reality. They exist abstractly in the form of opposition to a Change Request. 
---
Just remember; sometimes, the status quo is good, and *there for a reason*.
---
I think your personal life is getting confused with eve.
---
Wow did you just really say that
---
You don't go to CSM to keep the status quo or you're wasting your time. Every CSM member should be able to come up with a platform of 12 changes throughout a year. Is that too much to ask?
---
The rate limit is there so you don't spam useless or unreadable changes.
---
The well-known group around Russian iBea-st streamer claimed ,not even once, that their main drive in game is make others players life as miserable as possible , ruin their day . English speaking players missed this gem.
---
Why? because they play games too much and probably bored with everything else
---
You think there's a future, cute.
---
Sure, but that’s just because the blocks vote in an organized manner. If all the high sec pubbies wanted to get a high sec candidate on, they could, they way out number null sec. Plus, there really isn’t a problem with the CSM make up. Most of the current members have played for a long time and know the ins and outs of different parts of the game, and, contrary to pubbie beliefs, they actually want what is good for the game. The CSM is not meta gaming for their own benefit or the benefit of their alliance.
---
&gt; go out of their way to annoy random strangers
---
EVE is a roleplaying game. So they play the pirate.
---
Well thats how strategic warfare works. Noone likes to lose and in a strategic sandbox with full loot you always try to minimize losses. Yes their FC was too risk averse here but look in his Position. He has to explain later why he lost ships to a trap later
---
You don't go to the csm to give ideas for your pet project either.
---
What if the option presented by ccp is "keep status quo or fubar the game"
---
.
---
Don't you think having a formal system to help build up and promote easily accessible platgorms for candidates would help against blocks voting by the ping?
---
Bloc fleets *are* a waste of time. Try small gang.
---
That's an incredibly unreasonable criticism it's like saying that politicians campaigning is unfair to politicians who don't want to campaign.
---
&gt; I just wanna understand why people like you feel a need to be a dick to random internet stranger.
---
This is where you are just showing extreme bias and ignorance.
---
MANY MANY MANY answers have provided other reasons people gank, and you are so laser focused on this part, which isn't even that common among gankers.
---
The real question is why you want to sit around orbiting a rock for the rest of your life.
---
Nope. Saying you're gay isn't an automatic "I'm right" card nor should it be used as such.
---
I really love alot of these changes. However, I think the no timer, no dps limit really wouldn’t work out. A single super can dish out about what, 15K/20K dps? Just a couple of them would melt citadels so incredibly quick. Especially with your proposed asset safety and no timer idea this wouldn’t really work out. I would like to see a DPS limit on citadels albeit higher. And maybe some sort of “powering down” state which is a new state for citadels without fuel. They would function like a low-power citadel with the only exception if’s reinforcement timer.when this timer runs it will enter low-Power and lose it’s reinforcement timer(s).
---
This to give people who forget to fuel their citadels at least some time to refuel it.
---
&gt; However, by your own admission, you do what you do because it makes people angry at you.
---
He literally never said that.
---
And most people haven't said "salt" as a prime motivator, in fact, not a single person said that was their prime motivator.
---
He's not trying to scare you.
---
&gt; literally cannot fight back
---
Concord does though.
---
Drone bay.
---
Exactly this. Sesfan used to take us out in a bunch of bullshit stabbers and brutix's, and we'd go to renter space. He'd talk shit in local and the fight would be on. 
---
If you're touring around in t3/faction ships with logi, your chances of a fun fight go right out the window.
---
If you find yourself in a fair fight, you and your enemy both made mistakes.
---
But also, it is a fair fight. Everyone was docked up safe, and then made decisions from that point that put them where they were. Nothing unfair about that.
---
&gt; is to not play
---
No, just not mine.
---
This guy just hates player interaction.
---
Gee...
---
We have had five years of PVE friendly improvements across the board and now that CCP needs to rebalance that, we need to think of the PVE players first?
---
Oh man...
---
I think we can fix citadel spam and capitals in one go: give citadels propulsion mods and jump drives. Turn them into ultra capitals.
---
Think about it. I could fly my citadel over to another citadel, then the two citadels can fight each other so we don't have to.
---
Or if someone drops a bunch of titans I can drop a bunch of citadels on them. Then they drop a bunch of citadels and the citadels fight each other until everything is reffed. So the fight is basically paused and everyone can go back to krabbing for a few days. 
---
Some minor details to work out still but that's CCP's job.
---
Is there a guide for Abyssal Deadspace? I’m gonna do one for the first time tonight. Solo, not the three frigate
---
I agree fully and that handling is unacceptable. That's why it is much easier to join Horde. No ESI check. Sure some goon spais will fall through but we are well aware and even have fun **with** them.
---
Dude, is he trying hard or low effort?
---
Can you add to this :             
---
* 6 rigs engineering structures? So people don't have to drop multiple structures due to this fact. Rigs are the most expensive thing any way.                 
---
* Constellation or region wide index - no reason to drop sotyio in each system to save some tax if you still have to pay the same.      
---
* For a short period of time after those changes - when you unanchor structure you will get rigs back - just so people can clean up the space.
---
Let CCP make a formal voting based change request system limit it to one request per month per account and use the feedback to determine the roster of people eligible to run for CSM. We keep the current final vote system to determine the CSM out of the roster.
---
The idea is we send the people who have the most popular support but also who've been active in suggesting good popular changes though the year. Corps still have the option to channel ideas through a candidate throughout the year. The rate limit is there so that requests can't be spammed for the sake of building up participation points (EU reps looking at you).
---
That way we shouldn't have ten of a single bloc win the CSM simply because they have the most people in the game they'll have to compete with other alliances to actually have good ideas about the game and possibly work to build up one or two candidates through submitting good changes that the rest of the community supports.
---
**Every voter would then be able to read through the 12 submissions each candidate made and the feedback they got before casting their vote.**
---
&gt; logistical puzzles of mining.
---
There are none. It's totally brain dead.
---
Not the stront ... liquid ozone.     
---
Or some new element produced from some stront and much more liquid.
---
&gt; If it's not profitable, it's not worth doing.
---
Yet they still mine...
---
It's like watching Soccer, boring most of the time, but when they do score a goal, you get crazy.
---
Given how blackout went I think it’s unlikely any changes will be sourced from reddit for a good while.
---
Cyno mechanics are a huge issue - nobody knows what you're going to be fighting, so people either don't bother, or try and form up enough backup to fight a worst case scenario.
---
Incentives pvp, maybe add some kind of system to the game were you can mod your ship or modules based off how much you have blown up, if you want a stronger carrier you have to go blow up other carriers, it will make destroying things more wanted, and peace less preferable, if you add in a system were blowing up mining ships gets you points to mod mining gear you may even get the miners off the belts to go blow things up more, giving more content, helping fix the economy by improving threw flow, and everyone will want to because it's the only way to get your ships stronger. Maybe even make it so solo small gang and large gang all have different systems that make people want to go and do it in different ways.
---
killing carebears is fun
---
Its basically trolling. There are trolls in every MMO. In Eve one of its forms is ganking. Trolling in EVE will be more common due to relaxed rules regarding scamming, pvp, ganking etc.
---
It wasn't even numbers.  I was on grid cloaked during this engagement.  This battle report wasn't accurate as you also had 2 basi's on the field.  If you look they had 10 munins in the report to your 16 gilas as theur pilots were having to reship mid fight.
---
That's honestly a huge pile of overreaction over a limited experiment from CCP. As was the reaction to blackout. Players in EVE absolutely don't know what's best for them and would turn the sandbox into a concrete slab as they are doing right now. This is the natural behavior of people who want to protect and increase their power and assets. CCP needs to counteract that by making changes that reduce players ability to do that or we end up in a Serenity situation. It's as simple as that.
---
Try being a different part of the fleet. Be a scout or do recon work.. There's so much more that makes a fleet happen then just the FC and line members that mash f1 when told to.
---
Once you get into a position where you can be a unique part of the fleet and acutally make a difference then the fight part matters alot less.
---
And in the end its content that is behind a barrier of forming up with friends and being social.
---
Let's say ccp gets up and starts implementing this. What are the chances people won't throw an another reddit/eve forum tantrum and force ccp to back off?
---
Blackout should be replaced by a new Local system, delayed or sov structures that do a local “sweep” every 30 seconds or so.
---
Maybe we should do what Red vs Blue Alliance used to do...
---
Arranged fights, but at least you get to shoot stuff.
---
Fleet versus fleet in a system of choice.
---
Get in position  arena like and start firing.
---
When I started EVE years ago(2014), I always dreamed of being part of a large battle like in the movies or like idk in the Mass Effect final space battles.
---
This whole roaming for hours in the hopes to get a fight is bullshit.
---
Less blueballing and more pew pew would be great.
---
Screw entosis, screw timers and blueing neighbours.
---
What I\`d like to see is good old fashioned fleet vs fleet combat.
---
Where the skill of the FC, the training of your troops and the ingenuity of your fits determine whether you win or lose the battle.
---
If you cannot find content, make your own.
---
FW should get major attention that recognizes and emphasizes its ability to attract and retain entry level players as they develop their interest in the game.  There are lots of FW proposals out there for CCP to consider, but at this point the key thing is for them to go beyond the minor tweaks and really think about how to reinvigorate the FW ecosystem from the ground up.
---
One major thing that isn't talked about enough: do more to deepen and advance the fundamental world building of the EVE setting, specifically the Empires. There is a fundamental flaw in the FW "game" in that nothing really every changes due to the player actions in FW.  In Null / wormholes players feel the consequences of losing their territory. In FW most of the time losing a system isn't significant, because the pendulum will inevitably swing back and forth.
---
FW doesn't have to feel that way.  When it launched, and CCP was paying the most attention, there were story updates that made conditions in the warzone feel relevant.  Writing a few in game news stories that focus on the accomplishments of FW players doesn't sound like much, but it would at least be something. Even better than that would be in game events / contests that the FW militias could compete amongst each other for that translated to long term consequences in the EVE setting. Maybe once or twice a year a system or constellation actually switches permanently to one side or the other. Maybe one area becomes "secure" for a faction, while the warzone spreads into another.  These don't have to be part of fundamental changes to the FW game mechanics, but could be directly curated by CCP within bounds that are realistic for their development resources.
---
I started playing EVE in 2007, and I never really stuck with it until years later when I joined FW during the Gallente Militia's campaign to take total warzone control for the first time.  When we did it, CCP recognized the effort with a "medal" awarded by the President of the Federation. That single experience was transformative for my relationship with EVE, and is a big part of why I still play the game.  CCP could be facilitating those kind of experiences for players as an ongoing part of the EVE world.
---
Delete goons
---
And from the experience of small WH corps bringing anything else is just free killmarks for some guy's super, so you only fly nano shit. 
---
Early 2017 we were taking out kitchen sink gangs, Navy Brutixes, HACs, command ships, Machs, I even ran tech 1 cruiser gangs sometimes. But as capitals got more and more common we switched to 100MN and other kitey shit, because even groups who wanted a subcap brawl couldn't keep some guy from showing up to collect killmarks for his Hel. We hated getting pigeonholed into 2 or 3 viable comps but we hated getting waxed by some guy's fighters more.
---
It's been all downhill from there. Now we've got boson titans on gates and gangs of cloaky bombers blinking around a region. Just ganks, ganks and more ganks.
---
Don't bash it 'til you try it.
---
I almost resubbed but then I realised that these weren't real patchnotes.
---
How do i craft an enchanting table?
---
Join Wormholers. No asset safety guarantees fights
---
/u/CCP_Falcon pls respond
---
:D i was pretty happy to see that.  My twitter has kinda been on fire over it for 3 days now
---
Hey,
---
There are a couple of preset formations for your probes. Try moving them into a tighter formation around the signature you're trying to scan down. 
---
There are loads of tutorials for scanning on youtube that explain it fairly well.
---
Don't worry about not getting it right away either, it gets easier with time. Before you know it, you'll have stuff scanned down in under a minute.
---
1. You're missing the forest for the trees. 
---
2. You go to the CSM to represent the community.
---
3. Next year there *will* be a platform of "I won't let Olmeca make more bad changes" and it will have some success. It's a platform that doesn't advocate changes.
---
*  Cloaks now generate heat while active 
---
That make sense. While you are cloaked, your ship can't radiate all heat produced by modules into space to keep you "cold" and undetectable.
---
But i suggest to add some "heat accumulator" module that utilize mid slot and can store active cloak module's heat about 8 to 12 hours. Then you must to decloak to cool accumulators down.
---
Or
---
You can still get overheat on your modules and repair it with nanopaste. In this case you'll have 30 to 60 minutes of active cloak before it starts to damage ship's modules.
---
Do you mean that you cant probe* for cosmic anomalies?
---
Anomalies arent scanned down with probes. If there are any in the solar system you are in they will just appear green on your probe scanner window [assuming you're not filtering them out].
---
Cosmic signatures are the ones you scan with probes.
---
What issue are you having exactly? Is there a specific mission you're on?
---
No supers in lowsec would be nice. In fact I would be in favor of no capital ships in lowsec at all other than freighters and jump freighters and structures larger than medium citadels either.
---
It would help smaller alliances that are starting out that want to move out of high sec and in to lowsec as a stepping stone and for people looking for some fun solo/small gang pvp without worrying about some bored nerds dropping supers and cap's on them.
---
Oh yeah haha
---
come out to goon space, everyone hates us, and we have a 24/7 fleet ready to drop on that hate. there is always a fight to be had in Delve even post black out, they never seem to learn.
---
Well there is an Issue wish having a cap. Defenders can spam citadels out around their space to prevent Others from anchoring anything near them. 
---
And if you limit to how many citadel a corp/alliance can anchor then people will just create shell corps/alliances just so that can anchor more.
---
No supers in lowsec would be nice. In fact I would be in favor of no capital ships in lowsec at all other than freighters and jump freighters and no structures larger than medium citadels either.
---
It's all down to CCP  to give us content.  Sadly during the last few months,  they have been removing a lot of stuff from the game (cyno!) and not adding anything new.  The ship balance is forgotten about. Any cool new ideas are met with: We don't have the devs to do this and that!  
---
 Well what do you have devs for? Removing cynos costs Dev time and massacres the capital content down to 0, but they did it anyway.  Blackout was fine, but only Cloaka Loki and bombers ever undock because they've been OP for years and blackout made it much worse. 
---
 Add local enabling towers?   NOOOO we need devs for failing new titles,  why would we invest time and money in the only product to ever bring money to CCP ???
---
This game used to be so good now it just sux!
---
&gt;I just can't figure out why anyone would consider blowing up a single ship and instantly dying at the hands of CONCORD to be rewarding gameplay.
---
That's why you get ganked.
---
No, it is not. Go away.
---
&gt; Asset Safety tax increased to 30%. 15% is removed from the game, 15% is paid to the corp wallet of the pilot who scored the last hit.
---
What about putting items into Asset Safety manually without the structure dying or even dodging a structure kill in process? Just set the tax to 30% removed from the game for all cases and be done with it.
---
You are making the assumption that CSM is more than just a chance to go to Iceland.
---
First time I saw them i was flying my pvp ikitursa (so yeah kinda blingy but that money was invested for PvP not PvE). Cleared the site in about 8 minutes.
---
Now i keep farming them in the same fit (i didn't even try another ship since my pvp fit does the job), i just carry a web and refit to switch between pvp and pve (web helps for damage application in these sites). Good thing is, i don't have to buy a farming ship and very good isk for the effort required. With web it takes me between 6 and 7 minutes.
---
Nice thing is that i don't have to do any manual piloting. The fit just tank like a boss every wave and is cap stable so i just sit inside the site &gt; web &gt; kill
---
I managed to do between 6 and 7 sites per hour depending on damage application and until now 5 out of 7 times i get around 25M loot (rest of the times i get only 5M loot). I don't salvage which give around 150M isk / hour.
---
Last fleet i joined was a massive TII cruiser battle which we lost isk war wise but had a blast in. 30 or so kills. Eagle survived. TBH it varies and this is NOTHING new. I got bored of null in 2006 due to so many fights not happening because people were risk averse. Still happens now though but yeah.
---
Let me guess, you are in one of the major blocks with 10000+ players? Half of eve is set blue to you and you are complaining about having a hard time finding a fight?
---
How much time did you actually spend ratting, and what was the attention level like?
---
&gt; All these activities are just as safe as ratting in nullsec if you know what you are doing. 
---
All of those take far more effort to get going though, and liquidation process.
---
My name is ozymandias...
---
leave botting alliance
---
Yes because supers are not safe enough...
---
Maybe it is because there's no real objective in Eve. And because of that fact, everyone is expected to create their own objectives in Eve. And maybe as a result of that everyone does their own f\*\*kin thing.
---
There's really nothing worth fighting over. Territory perhaps, but that fight is reserved for the top 2%.
---
Yes, per character is the important measure though.
---
And the wormhole sites aren't infinite.
---
nah, just get a ratting marshal

But you can buy ISK with real life cash through PLEX.
---
Gonna have to get everyone here to constantly post on this post, as well as posting this on the eve forums so that everyone keeps talking about this. If this is always at the top of this list of things people see then it might happen. Otherwise everyone will forget about this post in a week
---
If you post this on the forums and add a link, I will bump this every day to ensure that it is always at the top.

Becauase most of these fucktards like masturbating over their green killboards. It's as simple as that really. I don't see the point of killboards either. You look at the kill and then it just gets buried under hundreds of other kills.
---
After reading all the comments and your responses to them I am pretty sure you are either very very stubborn and don't WANT to understand. Or you are just a dumb boy.
---
done  providence roam,found  npc dread on belt,three shots and my kronos was in hull.got out alive.
---
Anchoring an Astrahus on the path of an orbiting Keepstar could work as a battering ram.
---
Try faction warfare. Lots of smaller scale content there. Once you learn how to create content yourself it gets easier. Null might not be the best place to start out pvp. Or join a group that have lots of kills on your timezone in zkill.
---
Not begging, asking. they can say no.
---
I can't do that IRL, but it's funny seeing someone lose their cool. Why? Just because it is, a part of human nature or just me enjoying other people's suffering - pick what you like.
---
Low sec, too, is in dire need of a overhaul, ie modernization.

You have my vote for csm next year if I'm still subbed.

No now. 
---
We all agree it has to be balanced. We merely not agree where said balance is. Once could say that 200m isk ph with no effort or danger is unbalanced. Some may say it is not enough and they will unsub until they can get 1bil / hour while archon ratting.
---
It's all part of the fun.
---
While I get the point of more neutrals but if you join a milita and do FW you can easily and more safely make more money in lowsec than nullsec.
---
&gt; in my coalition
---
^ Here's your problem.
---
There are lots of reasons. It is just extremely hard in current meta. You will meet capitals every time you bring something larger than frigates. Only few extremely talented groups did it succesfully.
---
It was bit easier in blackout because you could evade blobbers easier by moving systems and avoiding their intel. Now it’s really hard again.
---
&gt; come out to goon space
---
and then
---
&gt; we have a 24/7 fleet ready
---
Guess why nobody's coming...
---
If you feel like you are making too much ISK, just send 50% to me. Easy fix.
---
Tbh if CCP add a random to where stuff if spawning on havens and sanctums titan ratting will go away.
---
I usually make my money by exploring since ratting and mining is boring AF  but if the possibility exist it'll make ratting in general a lot less profitable. Would also hurt afkers more than legit ratters.
---
**Local Chat based on CONCORD lore. **
---
CONCORD upholds the local channel network with their transponders, the further away from them, the longer the delay. Secstat may be a good scale that is already in game. Naturally WHs have no connection, so no local. Sov Entities can install structures to minimize the delay ("Observatories"). I have no clear vision on the stats of the "Observatories" yet.
---
It shouldn't hurt, the community's coming together to try and revitalize the game they love, even if they hate each other internally.

Try reading the post again.

Regular nerfs - small ones                               
---
Once a month look at the most used ships across a bunch of categories and make very small nerfs like 1-3% on 1-3 values the goal is to reduce the prevalence of AHAC/Mach/munins online meta's that last for years, whilst avoiding power creep or simply replacing munins with the next ship.
---
The idea is not to remove the ability to use the ships via almighty nerf hammer but to increase diversity, as diversity increases reduce the scale of the nerfs, until no one ship accounts for more than say 30%. Personally i would avoid fitting changes and go for stats such as sig/speed/optimal range/ROF and the like, so as not to destroy fits.               
---
Some possible categories.  
---
Fleet PVP - 100+ fleet size
---
Fleet PVP - 10 - 100 fleet size
---
Small gang &lt;10                   
---
  
---
Solo PVP Nul/WH/FW                           
---
Mining - Ice                      
---
Mining - Ore                    
---
Ratting - anoms/DED's
---
really another hilmar sock puppet account?
---
fucking love that song
---
You wh guys have some of the coolest fights, from what I\`ve gathered from reddit and friends that live in J space.
---
But it would be great for that to happen everywhere in the game.
---
Wardecs in hi sec should be more meaningful.
---
Sure you cant claim sov of systems or upgrade them with the ihubs like in nullsec but you can still \`\`plant an imaginary flag in that area\`\`.
---
I always believed that the wardec mechanic was designed for new players in hi sec to experience and get the hang of life in null sec, a tutorial of sort, a way for new players to get used to living in a place where other people can shoot you without CONCORD coming to your aid.
---
A way to simulate null(in a more or less toned down fashion) or to be able to shoot others(without CONCORD punishing you for it) while in the relative safety of hi sec with the ability to end \`\`the simulation\`\`.
---
The fact that there are people(like some mercenary corps/alliances who I will refrain from naming) that like to use this mechanic/feature to harass and/or drive new players corps out of the game or force them into null blocks is unfortunate but predictable, given how  we EVE players are...
---
We need more people to join EVE and enjoy playing it.
---
Instead of blapping them the moment they undock or make a corp, how about we let them grow and allow them to create their own identities.
---
I know EVE is a harsh mistress, adapt or leave and all that jazz, but less people means less targets, less people to talk to or fly alongside with.
---
We are getting old and perhaps our mentality is hurting the game we love to hate.
---
Why dont we take a step back on all this sabotage and subterfuge and give the new blood a chance to make a name for themselves.
---
Or we could keep to our antics and plummet further and further into stagnation....
---
There may be some legitimate reasons but it's mostly griefing. If you're not familiar with that expression google it. There is research why people show this behaviour but I never looked into that.
---
Reaction for you: either go for ships which are very difficult to gank (Let's say a procurer) or pay more attention. And don't ever give them salt. Or even worse pay some mining license. Both just makes even more of a target.
---
For legitimate reasons: You might have made some enemies. They might want to mine there themselves (probably other characters though). Maybe there are some more legitimate reasons but imho it's most of the time griefing. They usually give some stupid reasons why it's supposed to be proper gameplay. Best now example of the is "the Code" see http://www.minerbumping.com/p/the-code.html
---
Good for you - not everyone is interested in soloing Russians in abyssal/deadspace ikitursas with high-grade whatever shit plugged in and all bought with botting isk.
---
Have fun (100% honest, no sarcasm here, it's just totally not for me).
---
Sorry but if you want to go into this direction then Rorqual mining makes you 100mil/h.            
---
I always look per person not per character.
---
AT cov ops dictors, in before 100% SRP for dictors bankrupts the alliance
---
because annoyig other people generates content ( in any form, be it fun, salt farming, hoping for response or further escalation....and so on)
---
people like to tease people.
---
also being a dick , is deeply rooted in mankinds behaviour.
---
so why does one clown throw a banana peel on the floor to make another clown slip on it....because it will cause laughter.
---
see those pirates as the clown with the banana and you be the clown slipping on the peel. thats life.
---
why is my landlord a dick? why is my boss a retarded psychopath?why did pol pot hate " educated" people?...
---
you see, your asking a deeply philosophical question here. 
---
it nearly makes me wonder : did you ever go outside and witnessed real life in the real world? and you still ask why people are dicks in a computergame?
---
hell people are dicks in the real world too...
---
Yet ratting WH dread kills are so rare.
---
Remove asset safety for:
---
- M-Size Citadels (POS equivalents)
---
- Unfueled Citadels (Magic should require Mana lol)
---
Keep it on L/XL Citadels as long as they are fueled.
---
So you want to say it is fine because it is 2 chars?
---
Because they are having fun, the majority of people do it because they can nothing more than that, and the challenge is only the correct application for a perfect strike, just like a BLOP's drop.   There are some who do it because they want tears, they would find your measured question above as tears and would get off on it.   In my experience gankers want a conflict with someone who they can defeat in some way, that is why generally they go after people who can't fight back.   Though there are some who are very good players.
---
The best approach with salt gatherers is ignore them and treat them with pity.   Which is is close to what you did above.   :P   Have fun o7
---
Remove tethering from unfueled structures -  no fuel --&gt; no magic repping/capping invulnerability field
---
Anyone with isk will insure on an alt and just blap things off the undock to lvl up their main ship, you only have to look at the price difference from t2 to faction to officer to see that blowing up 100 carriers would be worth it for a meaningful increase.                       
---
If its not a meaningful increase its not worth worrying about.
---
Although the damage is already done and CCP would have to remove player assets to get this in order again:
---
Limit the building capabilities for Supers/Titans again - from 1 Slot per POS to near limitless scaleabillity with Sotyios was not good.
---
It's a Chinese game.. they don't follow Copyright.. nothing can be done.
---
local not removed from npc null?
---
Why am I still seeing cynos fitted to ships other than recons/blops e.g.  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78993146/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78993146/) 
---
Is this an exploit?
---
Christ, man, can you set aside your retarded narrative for five minutes?
---
Per character is how you normalize the values.
---
Comparing a person rorqual mining with 20 accounts to a person running level 3 missions solo in highsec is disingenuous.
---
Scalability is an important metric, but per character is how you compare apples to apples.
---
Sshh, there are people here who gets anxiety because they think space is empty now that they can't instantly see who is in the system and what corp do they belong or even what that person killed back in 2016. They HAVE to know!
---
I do it for the same reasons I would rather do pvp than shoot rats, with a few additional reason.
---
I'm likely to get a sweet killmail for my efforts. I could roam for a few hours and only find a big blob, or nobody with my luck.
---
I get to shoot player controlled ships
---
I get to bring pvp to players who are underprivileged or botistic.
---
"Eve is a sandbox where anything can happen" never feels more true than randomly shooting somebody who thinks they're safe on a whim. I feel like I'm living up to CCP's marketing by doing it as well.
---
There's 2 types of juicy killmails. The kind where you destroyed something expensive (like a T2 mining ship) or where it's something to brag or laugh about amongst friends.
---
Yes true but it still achieves the purpose putting value back into isk, and not many people will want to blow there own stuff up when they could go blow up other peoples stuff for free. I dont doubt that some would blow there own stuff up, but most people will probably prefer the content mixed with incentive over blowing up there own isk.
---
i was talking about a garmur..hell who does NOT put launchers on a garmur?
---
stabs on a garmur..no matter what malus...would be reeeetaaarrrdddeeeeddd too. ( except u use it a s a lowsec travel taxi maybe..but still a pretty dumb idea, theres cheaper and better suited ships for that matter) 
---
also a garmur is not a dedicated tackler, even with the hull boni, i rarely see garmurs as tackle..
---
the stiletto is king. 
---
and if u go bling prolly the malediction is king of kings.
---
 and wasting 1 lowslot on those for a stupid useless wcs..god imagine the luls about a lossmail like that ...
---
I’m on the same page as OP. Came back to the game because of blackout and I loved it. The feeling of danger in every NS system.
---
- and very unpopular opinion of mine is that CCP was WAY too soft with what they call Chaos Era.
---
Now that blackout has gone the game is back to the state of ‘meh’ and the only place to find something resembling danger is WH space.
---
Next to that when it comes to upgrading suppers, if you are required to kill suppers to upgrade them, most people will not want to kill there own titan or super to get the upgrades, but having upgraded supers and titans could be a big enough advantage to make people need them, forcing cap ship combat to happen more frequently, and helping force content,
---
Yea because that's how you run a company with huge risks.
---
Big words from someone who lives on an allowance.
---
I for one am glad to know when there is nobody in system so in don't waste time searching and can directly warp to next gate instead of warping over gatespots for 10, 20, 30 jumps every roam to not get fucked by gatecampers.
---
If you bother to check popular posts of the last few years, this community is more interested in shitposts and memes than actual constructive discussions. Mods are just doing what the community demands. 
---
And if you bother to check other subreddits, no matter the main topic, this is also the general trend. 
---
Personally, I hate it because I think reddit is a great medium to share ideas and discuss things but the vast majority simply is not interested in such things. They are here for entertainment and drama mostly.
---
If you want serious and mature discussions, you have to create your own subreddit and curate the content or find a different platform.
---
Who the fuck downvoted a newbro for asking a legitimate question?
---
Your argument, and all your trolling replies, boil down to "a ship specialised for mining can't fight a ship specialised for 9-15 sec of max DPS in hisec". Correct. By design. So what's the problem?
---
Ships that had them fit before the patch hit will still have them fit, they're just offlined and cannot be onlined.
---
I'm hesitating between let NS guys believe WH is a wonderful country, full of safe ISK (for juicy killmails purpose).  
---
and give some reals tips for people wanting to come living in WH  
---
btw, if you make 250M/h in C3 with one ship, you are going it right
---
If you want WH Space why not go there?
---
The wheel never turns around boi
---
The game has inherent issues regarding this as others have mentioned. But you have to understand one thing, the PCU counter does actually mean something. There is a lot less players on today than 2 months ago. This will most def stifle fleet vs. fleet action.
---
Give it some time. Let the numbers start picking up again.
---
Mining in hisec is not that profitable, absolutely and this guy thinks that they think only in terms of ISK, no they are chilling out and playing the game their way.   And that bothers him a lot.
---
Well memed
---
Thats next iteration of "space bushido" that I call "space bullshito".  Most of the killmails are generated on things that can't defend itself be it highsec barge (what exactly stops you from using combat fit skiff? Oh, min - maxing ...), nullsec VNIs etc., even pve supercapital rarely can defend itself from organized drop.   
---
What you need to understand that you are a part of an ecosystem in which shit needs to die. It doesn't matter if it's pvp ship or pve one, highsec, lowsec, nullsec or wh. You are mining because a ship did explode and needs to be replaced. Thats how minerals demand is created. Dude flying 300 mln+ barge with no tank is just an easy target and paid the price for being cocky while trying to maximize his gains. Now someone will earn money by replacing this barge. 
---
What most people don't realize is that highsec gankers are predators hunting for dumb prey. It actually benefits you even if you are highsec miner or hauler - without gankers market would be dominated by experienced / high sp / purple equip min - maxers doing their job afk. Take hauling as an example - with gankers active people are forced to haul smaller contracts. If there were no gankers active there would be less hauling jobs as you could just put multiple billion contract in your cargo expanded freighter and fly afk.  In my time I did a bit of freighter ganking and it made me laugh as I got banned from haulers channel. Not only my activity did in fact help them but I used to create a lot of hauling contracts myself.
---
Faction titans are 400b+ people will still do it. I've seen titans go for less than 40b and supers for 8.
---
I honestly dont know if its ever been any different. People keep complaining about caps but the blobs were always there. Im not scared of caps, I know they suck. But going solo vs. 10 players will get you killed. And I can hardly expect them to solo me just because. Thats what lowsec if for.
---
Didn’t say I want it. I’m saying it’s the only place that has some danger to it.
---
It's impossible to get your pod in hisec if you're paying attention.
---
I've never met CODE.
---
Ye I keep hearing of these magical CCP numbers. 
---
I have no fking clue how anyone would ever be able to come to that conclusion. Like how would you even go about doing it? Eve has without a doubt one of the worst reputations amongst MMOs. How can you calculate how many never even try the game because of this rep?
---
Its impossible dude. I dont get why anyone would ever argue otherwise.
---
So blackout in npc null?
---
1) Create a frozen corpse launcher
---
2) Bring back event with beacon in all space
---
like all good addictions, you never really stop wanting it
---
it's not actually doing it that counts
---
They will, but i doubt they will act on it.
---
Eve is Dying :c , but this game not :D Fly Safe o7

"Sir you're needed in yuali!"

---
Welp, I gotta be honest, I’m lost with this comment. But good talk!
---
If they detect a titan they spawn a dread and super bomb and infini point.
---
Nah, miners do think only in isk. They just are really bad at it.
---
Bla Bla... Bla
---
There's danger in not being able to shut off gates. I think /u/_line wants freedom of movement but not freedom of information.
---
See, you're trying to farm your salt even now by calling me butthurt. You just can't avoid it, can you?
---
If you like masturbating to the feeling of superiority you get from killing miners, good for you. I don't care. I'm not one of your victims.
---
Yeah I understand that! Since the fix to the gate spawn though there has been variety in ships. Lots and lots of Gilas, which can be fun to fight if you’re in the right ship. I’ve had a blast fighting Gilas in both a Phantasm and Orthrus. Usually Gilas are the same, but the one I fought the other day was an active tanked Firestorm runner and that was an insane fight that I lost in my Orthrus in. 
---
About the Russian ISK bottling thing, the top tier dudes running the expensive Ikis (which have been killed by Curses and Cerbs) aren’t even Russian.
---
Oh noes, I have to look at dotlan and actually take some gate to the most farmed system in the game to gank defenseless ships.
---
So much effort.
---
&gt; good job proving to me that you are mentally handicapped 
---
Ad hominem attacks prove that you're just a sad excuse of a player.
---
I will go away, I’ll go away to the abyss and have all the fun and loot to myself! ;)
---
It's fun shooting things. Don't take it personally.
---
Butthurt is dripping from every sentence you write. But sure, externalise it.
---
"I can't understand it therefore the data  doesn't exist."
---
Something like this?
---
T2 trav/drifter style keepstar
---
Has a 20LY jump drive on a 7d (or 30d) cooldown
---
    -unable to jump while reinforced
---
    -only able to jump in nullspace
---
    -no super docking?
---
    -Anti Super DD instead of AOE one (ramp up dmg trav style or something driftery)
---
if you are mining in a hulk in highsec in 2019, you are doing it very fucking wrong lol.
---
barges have been replaced by orcas + drones in highsec since like...years ago
---
Learn which fcs actually get a good fight and which want to just blob and follow the good ones.
---
&gt; big coalitions bring safety and order. Humans love those two things
---
On the other hand games are supposed to be played for fun. Almost everybody enjoys PvP, just the flavor differs. Just look at the spikes in players when a big war is happening (a long time ago). 
---
Safety and order get boring after a while and if those are the only reasons you play you will stop playing. And Eve, especially the sov-null playstyle, does not have many personal goals that will keep players motivated after a certain point. And this is the steady decline we have watched over the past years.
---
&gt; since there are now so many other options for games to play
---
Has that ever been different? It is not like game development had stopped from 2010-2015.
---
Four obsidian blocks placed in a reverse T shape, two diamonds in the top corners and one book, that’s how you craft an enchanting table by nibba.
---
Give me 5 examples of CSM advocated changes that improved space other then nullsec ( and no limiting damage of an already advocated change doesn't count ).
---
I usually go to compare /h.      
---
For me 5 rorquals mining and guy in 2 rattlesnakes is 500mil/h no matter how you look at it.
---
- remove Capitals. (yes all of them)  (except jump freighters, add jump capable assembled-ship transporter)
---
- remove all citadels except one per constellation. All contents go to that one citadel.  
---
- null-chat is changed to constellation wide instant.  
---
- Add structure that can be fueled to pulse once per hour (no less than 30 min) which disables all active cloaking devices for 15 minutes, and gives affected ships combat timer. 
---
- diminishing payout of anomalies if too many are cleared per hour.
---
Even if a ship can’t dock at an Upwell structure, Tether and repairs will still be available (so long that it doesn’t have any weapon timer or active target lock).
---
Depending on your station there can be multiple undocking locations . Ex athanor found 3 depending on ship size.
---
Why do people praise this changes?! Apart from structures maybe none of this are that good
---
there's some nice green matigu sea beast ones for caldari ships
---
4 years ago? lol where was this, I can't remember anyone who was still running a perma gate camp except for XiX and pets in Geminate on the Oijanen gate.
---
made me chuckle now take my upvote XD.
---
I was referring to null big blocks as a whole not horde
---
Hey for its time it was quite awesome. The first one tho.
---
cringey lil retard
---
&gt; If you are in a 30k man alliance and you think a few defence fleets are too much effort, get good at the game because you are clearly trash.  
---
If you're a frequent small gang roamer and you think you deserve to have 500 people waiting for you in every constellation, I think you need to review your priorities, you clearly need to do something else than playing Eve.
---
&gt;  you literally just said cloaky roaming gangs have "0 risk" 
---
Pre or post blackout, cloaky gang is the safest pvp of all, you wouldn't dare to say otherwise. Especially if you fly Nullified cloaky Lokis, it's even worse.
---
&gt; but borderline afk ratters were at risk pre blackout.  
---
90+% of subcaps ratters loss before blackout were mostly because being afk prevents you to warp off when someone come for you.
---
But if you knew how to read, you couldn't have missed :
---
&gt; Yes, blackout-less nullsec is too safe.    
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; When local is up, ratters can warp off when they see someone coming, but when it isn't, they die. 
---
Were did I say afk ratters were at risk, again ?
---
Oh, yes, probably there :
---
&gt; Sure, that's why Caps were dying everyday everywhere. These people must have all been afk right ? 
---
Which is followed by :
---
&gt; I never said nullsec wasn't too safe, mind you, just that you need balance and neither blackout nor no blackout were providing that. 
---
But apparently it's too difficult for you to understand.
---
&gt; Ok dude now i know you are just trolling, noone, not even a goon, is unironically this dumb. Noone in existence. 
---
Well it seems I must be. Trying to discuss with some random wormhole guy that never lived in the space he's currently vomiting his hate on. What an error.
---
Next time try to read what people are saying to you without your spin glasses on, and actually answer what has been said instead of just sperging.
---
Those are not available for purchase. They’re old.
---
Agreed. Orange is the worst color and some ships have no good options :(
---
No, when its impossible to actually have such data it becomes a joke. You cannot measure people not playing your game because of its reputation. How would you do that? By sending out surveys to a billion or so people?
---
I mean, think dude please.
---
A lot of good things, few that aren't , my questions/remarks:
---
Why no notification for wh spawn, will make rolling for wh people longer when we search for content. Also will it work for wh that spawns in null sec, if yes it's a balance trade I guess but how long will it last, if we can't roll a shitty connzction and have to wait 10/15min that will be awful.
---
Incursions in high sec are bad, HS shouldn't be profitable like that, it should be smaller, not profitable and design for newbies not to sustain fleets of orcas completely safe for example. 
---
People should be push to move to ls/ns/wh not stay forever in hs.
---
With reduced ehp of cap/super, will the cost be reduced too?
---
Wouldn't it favoured big groups that can put a lot of fax on grid to keep those «paper» cap/super alive?
---
About the nerf of local rep fax, how will it affect their use in wh?
---
Does superiority figthers will still be usable by carrier?
---
For command destroyer, would a kind of fatigue better, 30s is short, it should go up to 5min if you jump multiple times the fleet , you can go further but it will allow more time to catch you.
---
Do you think of the use of cloak in wh with you heat things? Just seems aimed to cloaky camper
---
You need a fucking job at CCP. No one will agree with everything but those are some awesome changes. A lot have been posted before but not so well thought out and well organized. CCP take a hard look at this write up if you actually want the game to become a fun sandbox game again.    
---
A++++
---
I did and i lost my frigates..... Time to get good
---
I like green i wish there was green skins for more ships.
---
I didn't realise.
---
It does seem to be the case that a lot of skins are hard to get a hold of, I get CCP might want to make some skins rare, but the more need to be available on he plex store permanently.
---
You will find them on market.
---
Still this is not fighting back.
---
Yes! Please. And ty for bundling that stuff in this thread.
---
Which is what we need. New activity in null. Newer players actually getting a chance to make a foothold.
---
My 5 cents regarding asset safety:
---
If its too cheap makes loosing a structure something slightly annoying (which it shouldn't).
---
 If its too expensive or don't even exist would discourage people coming back to the game after a taking a break and then find all your stuff gone. (with the old system you could at least firesale it to new owners or negotiate terms for you to evac)
---
In order to try to solve this 2 issues i would start with asset safety recover cost VERY high (80%-90%) and then lower it slowly until it reach a minimum of 15% after 6 months - 1 year
---
In your personal opinion. How do you feel about the changes suggested in this post?
---
The dull brown and grey also exist quite frequently.
---
I don't know man, I don't know. Must be some kind of mistake somewhere in this thread.
---
Fighters application got nerfed now. And btw, Whers never take fair fights, why should we ?
---
Except it leaves 3 other characters that could also be rorqual mining while the 2 rattlesnakes rattle.
---
You like comparing apples to oranges but that doesnt make sense.
---
Because if this guy is doing 1 myrm, comparing it to 2 rattles solves nothing, as if he had 2 characters he could do 2 myrms.
---
That's just the way you chose to read it. I just have a certain distaste for hunting miners in highsec.
---
It's nothing but masturbation.
---
He said he brought 2 Gilas 1 phantasm and a Loki, no links in his comp. that’s a slow ass kiting comp if there is one you can engage it with pretty much anything kitchensink as long as you have something to force off or neutralise the loki like you know neutes or damps. In case of danger you can just shoot Gila drones anyway and phantasm just get damped/neuted into oblivion by same support. But having brain or balls is hard and warping in a super is easier since it will deal with any problem. This reminds me the nonsense we heard back when lurch hics were supposedly the only way to deal with so called kitey bulshit.
---
I upvoted you because I genuinely can't tell if you're an actual alpha neckbeard or a legit genius at impersonating one.
---
It just cost 1.5bil
---
lol i usually don’t fight the wh people inside there hole, one maybe you never know right
---
Large and stratop fleets are a total waste of time - FTFY.
---
Farming NPC dreads all day won't crash the economy yes.
---
The reason you think that is because you're too lazy to read the CSM minutes and enjoy making things up.
---
Yeah, and some of them goes even for 10 billions. Is in their interest making some good looking skin, why on earth someone would buy that red nightmare skin? Apart from collection.
---
Maybe seek out the CCP data and read it rather than all the argumentum ad incredulum?
---
Make the game more approachable. People give up before they can even understand the game properly, it's overwhelming. Eve is so deep it has it's own language, I can't understand what you guys are even talking about half the time. I just lurk here, Eve looks so cool but I don't know where to even start.
---
He Replied in a thread that he would forward it and gave the link for the forum page that is actually used by the devs for player ideas
---
1- Roll a wormhole into Malpais
---
2- Go to NSI and find someone, flee immediatly to reform to something else
---
3- Come back with stronger comp past "all their eye" that were probably not there
---
4- Expect a fight vs some people that have no intel about your actual force, with no possible backup to counter escalate as NC is deployed 30 jumps away and with nano bullshit.
---
5- Post on Reddit that nullsec doesn't take the fight because they expect you to not have shown your whole hand.
---
6- Karma flowing in.
---
shoot someone structure, toast there sov, there’s no way you won’t get a fight eventually lolol.
---
Wcich is what makes those of you in the mega alliances propsing changes to destabilize more impressive. I'm assuming y'all that actually enjoyed challenges in the game are getting bored with the current null state as well.
---
&gt;Almost everybody enjoys PvP, just the flavor differs. Just look at the spikes in players when a big war is happening 
---
Yes and no. When they want to make money they dont like PvP. Big wars got spikes not because ppl loved pvp so much but because they wanted to be part of something bigger and there was still order in those engagements most of the time. Chaos only ever happened when someone fucked up.
---
yea abyssal pvp is a rich mans game, like stupid rich lol
---
Obiviously there are some non orange/yellow/red skin, but usually they are old and goes for +1bil. Just take a look arraund and see in how damn many skins orange/red/yellow is present.
---
100mn Gilas, Phantasm (with it's AB bonuses) and properly set up lokis can be pretty damned kity, mate. You'd need long-range webs to pin those down, as the Gilas would eat any small tackle before they even got in range.
---
As soon as they see a couple of Rapiers or Lokis unlocking, they are already making a dash back to their entry hole. They'd be mad to stick around on grid with those.
---
And sure. As soon as you get on top of them with enough webs to keep them tied down, dunking them is pretty simple. But in order to do that they have to make several rather large errors.
---
Ok lets compare then 2 rattles running WH sites and 2 mining rorquals.            
---
THis is like 250mil vs 200mil.         
---
Those rattles are more broken than rorquals based on what you are saying.
---
An anthology series a la black mirror.
---
orange  ccp skin on armageddon looks nice
---
Before any change is implemented-whining needs to be nerfed.  Especially from "l33t pvpers" that cant catch oracle thats paying attention to surroundings.
---
You want to bring in new players AND retain them? Nerf toxicity. 
---
You want to ACTUALLY combat inflation of PLEX prices? Introduce NPC that sells that thing for reasonable price in isk. That will also combat inflation, because NPCs just burn isk.
---
Thanks for your advice!
---
With the anchoring mechanics for citadels any slot limit per structure would just lead to more structure spam
---
Because he likes red.
---
Hardly.
---
isk/hr is only one metric.
---
But comparing non-normalized earn rates is nonsensical.
---
It was no biggie...
---
I didn't know that. Thanks!
---
If you look through that thread on fhc, or my posts on Reddit, I've made several updates if you're interested. The salty people in this thread (unspoken, rote &amp; co) usually brigade them before they get a chance to get some traction and be visible tho.
---
That music gave me a 87d 13h Tidi.. thanks..
---
We are comparing 1h gaming session.        
---
EVE is game you don't sit on it 8 or 24h.
---
you need multifeq in you’re life
---
So let's compare 1000 rattlesnake bots to 1 rorqual.
---
Also, I prefer to play EVE in longer spurts, as it is more isk efficient to continually cycle than to stop and start. I don't play often, but when I do I prefer 6 hours or so.
---
If I had 120 bookmarks in a system, I'd probably toast by the time I find the right one to warp to. Nevertheless, good advice. Thank you!
---
[Check out this Phantasm! ](https://abysra.com/character/2113210767/) It is a lot of fun and I’ve won some good fights with it, and made good money too!

Make sure everyone posts on the official forums link for them to read this =)
---
Yea. I don't blame the WHs from using these Nike doctrines. It gives them an advantage, which is smart.
---
However you also can't blame the null-seccers for not feeding you things. We know that there is not "gud fite" possible when dealing with these comps, so our best options basically become: ignore them until they go away, or use our home-field advantage and show up in with overwhelming force. Anything in between that yields the advantage back to the Nike comp's ability to pick and choose the engagements they want.

---
Made a link to it on the official forums CCP might actually read!!
---
Right?
---
Probably, still not a bad thing for the economy if people are blowing up big ships.
---
This is what squads/sigs are for. I was in a small gang pvp corp in syndicate for a while and the thing I hated most was the lack of a market. I would have to buy shit in Jita and either ship it myself or pay someone to haul it out to our staging station. 
---
Sigs in GSF were a nice middle ground for me I loved having the economic backing with the ability to get small gang fights.
---
&gt;So let's compare 1000 rattlesnake bots to 1 rorqual.            
---
You cannot.        
---
This is why i compare 'what a single, average person can do and is currently doing due to various reasons'.             
---
For example :          
---
* you can multibox rorquals up to as many client your PC can handle, but usually people go with around 5 due to cost                                    
---
* you can multibox as much myrms as your client can handle ... and usually you go into as many as you can                
---
* You can multibox like 2 carriers, but you at this point just go into a super                         
---
* You can singlebox a supercarrier ^(i know that some people can do 2 ... but those are not normal people)                      
---
* You can multibox 3-4 titans but usually use 1 due to cost
---
Capital proliferation needs the cyno nerf lol.
---
I'm not blaming anyone but CCP for ignoring these game design problems for the past 3 years. I'd drop capitals on gangs too if I were defending my space. 
---
Both sides are just acting in their own best interest. It's CCP's job to make sure that leads to fun gameplay and not the garbage we have now.
---
So right apple sand oranges.
---
The ganking community is a genuinely lovely group of people, with very rare exceptions.
---
I suppose the same could be true of the hisec mining community, it's just hard to see that when so many of them turn out to be awful, racist, misogynist, RL threatening psychos when they get PVPed.
---

CCP, y no fights?

Most of the game is pointless. This is just us killing time before the grave.
---
So you discount the fact that many are just chilling in a beautiful game..., this is a sandbox you know?
---
Yeh. true. my point is atleast now you have a CHANCE to blap that prick off the field. tis also why i suggested the ability to continue the cycle after lock. or even with a different ship/pilot. given one is brought up before a "Cycle" ends.
---
You don't know miners then.
---
Blocs are a waste of time. Unless you're a sheep
---
I know hisec miners better than you do.
---
Or once it reaches 0% it becomes "abandoned" and destroyable by anyone.
---
Poor you. How did you manage to survive without a 'buy all in my doctrine' button? :(
---
Sigs and squads are usually an illusion and I've seen them work inly in GSF. Elsewhere they are usually low on activity/participation due the reason you mentioned - there is no spoon-feeding and there are obstacles that do not exist in the blob space.
---
says the guy with leetspeak in his username
---
i don’t think it’s that’s serious, they would be reduced to structure bashing and only dropped in caps, that’s really limited
---
Normally yea. We actually got a good foght with Brave durong black out. We took battleships on a roam told them hey lets have a fair fight no caps. They honored it. 
---
Shout out to FC who had to evade with agro to form for us.
---
its up to the players, go out and find a fight, get points, and not spend 40-400B isk for them, or spend it, and boost the econ, win win
---
I answered your question.  You don't like it because you're a highsec carebear who wants perfect safety.  Guess what?  Until CCP completely caves and turns this into WoW, I'll be out there making it dangerous like it should be.  You don't have to like it.  I enjoy your tears. They fuel me.  I ganked that newbro just to make YOU angry.  I don't care if he quits because of it.  In fact, I hope he does.  I hope you go with him.  If I kill Eve, so be it - at least I'll have played the game the ruthless way it was once meant to be played.  Adapt or die.
---
Because I can.
---
Do it.  You occasionally get rewarded with a high concentration reddit salt thread like this.  It's great.  You don't even have to sub though - you can gank effectively as an alpha.  That's how much CCP approves of what we do.  They let ALPHAs do it!
---
Eventually our last remnants will float through space, untended, unattended, forgotten and a mere testament to prove that, yes, we once were here.
---
I don't agree with everything here, but I can see how much thought and work you've put into this. Thanks for a great post. A lot of these changes would be awesome
---
Ok heres my sugestion.
---
Jump bridges on carriers. Thers two goals with this change. First is to encorage (but not force) the umbrella to drop subcaps to save tackled caps, or at least make it easier for them to get on feild. Second the oh so overlooked little guy doesnt need a titan to bridge subs. 
---
Theres a bunch of ways this could be fine tuned, limit the mass on the jump bridge only allow a squad to jump etc. The important thing is that carriers get into that support/utility role and jumpbridges become available to almost everyone.
---
Yet you joined the biggest group in game, one which regularly "glasses" its neighbors space to force them to leave.  A group that was literally founded on "we're not here to ruin the game, we're here to ruin YOUR game." A group that started highsec ganking.  Preach all you want on r/eve.  Maybe you're ignorant, maybe you're being deliberately evasive.  But you are one of us.
---
See this is exactly what I said. You just lack knowledge and balls. You response is to undock a couple rapiers and lokis lol, you mean one per enemy ship? A 100mn gila barely goes 2km/s even with high grade snakes and a nano nobody even fly that useless shit anymore. All you need to have a fight with his gang is a single maulus to damp the loki as it’s the only ship they have that can pin anything of yours. As long as you’re not dumb you can start dancing and see if you get an opportunity and get them to come to close ofc if you start undocking a Loki blob with recons people are gonna leave not sure what you expect. Could as well just warp in a super at this point.
---
It gains you salt. We fuel our engines with it
---
&gt; No, just not mine afk in a max-yield fit in hisec.
---
ftfy
---
\&gt; Redo the map such that nullsec is in the middle, surrounded by a ring of lowsec, with highsec on the outer rim. 
---
I think before changing the map drastically, it might be a good idea to try less "invasive" measures at first. From my perspective, current resource distribution (among other characteristics) doesn't provide any real motivation to expand/conquer territory.
---
Right now, conflicts merely are "invented" in order to have something to do. It's all up to the players. Wars are fought for the sake of fighting wars, but there really isn't any other incentive. 
---
The fact that it is player driven is great, but at the same time it also has created the status quo.
---
At this point in time, all regions have pretty much everything. One could argue that the only difference is access/infrastructure to certain, more popular high sec locations (among some other, minor benefits depending on the region of space), but overall the differences seem minimal imho. There is no real major advantage to controlling certain space, it's mainly all subjective. 
---
While that is ok from a balancing perspective, it results in this mainly conflict-free situation. So what is needed is something of value in different regions of space that provides the motivation to at least send a large fleet to secure something valuable from a different region - or even create an incentive to build a heavily contested (temporary) outpost in enemy territory. 
---
**What kind of valuable stuff could this be?**
---
Basically, different types of resources, all of which are equally rare and are needed to further maintain the infrastructure of the core territory. It could be fuel or ore or a particular element that is either used for big ships, stations or whatever relevant technology that every corp/alliance would require to maintain their current power. 
---
Without these resources they would get weaker over time and increase chances for others to conquer their territory. Since every region requires different resources from different regions, everyone would be forced to invade other regions at some point - be it large scale wars or small raid fleets to quickly attack and secure those resources.
---
A certain amount of all of these resources would be needed to "power" the core territory (or relevant technology) which means every corp/alliance would have to fight wars and/or raid enemy territory on a regular basis, while at the same time trying to defend their own space, making it difficult for others to get access to these resources.
---
**Some ideas for basic mechanics**
---
* resources could spawn in certain systems which can not be camped using any kind of structures (similar to shattered WH), but only with active pilots waiting to strike nearby or patrolling those systems
---
* resources could be mined and/or collected from some kind of special anomaly - in general, requires scanning to find them
---
* resources sites could be camped, meaning the longer a certain group occupies nearby space within a certain radius, the higher the yield (this would be kind of king of the hill mechanic I guess) which would allow for different enemy strategies, e.g. attack resource site and kill enemy fleet/raid or wait for resources to be collected and attack haulers
---
* would require all kinds of ships, both PvP and PvE (miners, haulers, anom scanners), forcing everyone to build "mixed fleets" - or to focus on a particular setup to counter specific enemy fleet compositions, which also means that intel would be quite relevant
---
* special resource systems might not have local at all and don't allow structure anchoring, basically shattered wormhole space just without the wormholes
---
* constant flow of all different resources required - lack of resources has direct effects on strength
---
* if corps/alliances try to selectively conquer and control all territory near special systems, they will have to deal with a lot of fights because everyone *needs* a piece of that cake
---
* special resources would not increase strength but maintain *current* strength/potential, which means lack of special resources slowly weakens, but constant supply doesn't result in an overpowered corp/alliance
---
* big "empires" require more special resources, needs could increase exponentially, meaning there is a sweet-spot for "empire size" - beyond that, it might become increasingly difficult to maintain territory, e.g. a huge, greedy corp/alliance might be able to camp almost all special resource systems but at the same time increases risks to fall apart if there isn't 24/7 support fleets available defending the territory, making it possible for smaller corps/alliances to get access to these resources
---
* random special resource system distribtuion, meaning they are not concentrated in certain areas but in all directions, e.g. special systems could be found at the edge of the current map and could be camped without massive enemy interaction, but they still would have to enter other territory to find all the other needed resources since each system provides different types of resources
---
* random special resource systems might also" rotate" every few months, meaning the resource sites would provide less resources over time (slowly depleting) until they despawn. Then, another type of resource will spawn in that system, needs to be scanned down, etc.
---
* to make these special systems even more interesting, one could introduce certain "effects", e.g. local buffs/debuffs (similar to triglavian invasion) etc
---
* to avoid hoarding and maybe excessive trading, special resources might degrade over time; might also disable trading via markets and contracts - only face-to-face trading, e.g. meeting with two haulers and escort fleet, trade resources for ISK or whatever -&gt; forces constant resupply and introduces other risks such as piracy
---
**Benefits of this mechanic (imho)**
---
Everyone is forced to leave their territory because they are in actual need of these special resources if they want to be able to defend their space. Lack of special resources would result in weaknesses, making it easier to be conquered.
---
Everyone has to get access to enemy space all over the map. It is not enough to build an empire in a certain region and then sit there until the end of days - a more aggressive approach is required to maintain status quo.
---
Expansion comes with benefits but also with drawbacks. Big doesn't equal invincible anymore; size/wealth is required to maintain the status quo of a big empire but only if everyone is actively defending that space, which means real, active pilots would become more important than ever. A corp/alliance that manages to camp all relevant special resource systems will have to fight 24/7 all over the map - enemy forces can focus on single systems while huge empires will have to spread their force to fight several enemies at once.
---
Several systems all over the map become aggressively contested not because players are looking for content but because they *need* certain resources. Unlike other resources, these special resources are essential. It's not about creating wealth, it's about survival. Lack of these special resources directly impacts "empire strength".

&gt;like put some guys in tornados/thrashers/catalysts , put them into the belt on top of your mining fleet, and your fine. hell do it in shifts, first hour some guys do it, next hour they ship to miners and the miners ship to the defense ships...effort!
---
But that doesn't really help. All you do is getting your guys concorded attacking the gankers before concord shows up anyway. That's the only thing about ganking that bugs me. There's no protection, not really. Enemy warps in enough disposable ships, your stuff dies if you don't warp quick enough.
---
I don't want to get rid of ganking, I just wish there was something interesteting a competent group in HS could do.
---
I don't think you understand CSM.    Remember high school student council?   That.

I mean no disrespect to people who are or have been on CSM; they've tried their hardest.  But it is what it is.

---
Let’s be honest how much of this is just how NC is vs any statement about the “state of eve in TYOOL 2019”
---
And remove drone auto aggression
---
But as it stands a cap fleet dropped on anything less than a cap fleet = total erasure. There is zero reason for anyone to intrude on a blocs umbrella. Makes for extremely boring gameplay.    
---
Now caps being useful against other caps and structures but mostly useless against smaller stuff is in line with, well basically every piece of scifi out there. A fighter screen should be an actual fleet of frigs, not a group of carriers blapping everything in sight.

Take an upvote.
---
There was a suggestion a while back on just alligning the hit points on a battleship to fix the entire line.
---
Make shield ships....shield.  Make armor armor, etc.
---
The issue with the ship line compared to the Leshak is the Leshak actually has it's hitpoints in the right place. (Armor)
---
This one change would literally revive the entire battleship type.
---
Option B) "Look at" any Trasher in Amarr o Jita undock

CYNO make it so all ships with jump drives can jump to covert cynos beacons, or at least jfs as originally intended. Maybe even limit that to only covert cynos on Black ops bs only or something a bit more expensive to add to the risk. Still leave covert cynos on other shops but it can only jump to the bs one because it has higher capacitor or mass or something needed for a jf to jump to it
---
Would create content trying to kill and defend the Black ops bs that most rarely get a chance to and make it expensive enough that not everyone is willing to risk it to bring in a Rhea. And risk getting popped in a couple bil blackop or lose the jf. And with how neutd the Black ops bs's are it wouldn't need a rework. And would still be able to keep the new industrial cyno for those that would rather take the slower but cheaper route. 
---
Give the players the option of the higher risk financialy and faster or go with cheaper but slower.
---
I think this could be a pretty good compromise for those that liked the original idea of jumping a jf to a covops cyno and those that still want the low sp alts that they'd rather not invest anyore sp in than absolutely necessary.

Ratting caps are to safe in WH space if you know what to do.

My reasons for winning Eve after 13 years of playing are more to do with the fact I can't play it casually. I've tried. It's not about the money.
---
Look at me, I'm still PVPing on reddit and making Eve parodies having not logged in since world war bee.
---
I'll cheer the hisec content creators from the sidelines and try to help a few Code violators see the light. Miss you guys though, the Salvation of Gamis was good times.
---
No, it really isn't. One of the best things in this game is fighting outnumbered and winning (or at least not getting steamrolled). When you can reasonably assume the number advantage the enemy has can be countered by skillful piloting/FCing, I'm up to fight the odds. Nevertheless, if you get your 5 people gang dropped by multiple capitals/supers/titans/fleets it's more like https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ShowyAjarIberianemeraldlizard-size_restricted.gif

This is particularly true of the legion. I think like 3 of 4 skins for the legion are orange.

This is an ancient skit that was in its entirety hilarious.

Hit Alt+P to open probe scan menu (if it isn't already open).  Do you see anomalies (green) with three-letter/three-number designations?  Those are Anomalies, you don't have to scan them.
---
Do you also see Cosmic Signatures (red)?  If so, those are what you scan.  If not, left-click on one of the Anomalies and hit your 1 key.  That should unfilter Cosmic Signatures.  You can also do this from the Filtered box at the top-right of the probe scan window.

For more help actually scanning, follow the links are posting and watch YouTube videos.

lol, congrats for your uterly wasted time.
---
more of those, world will be way better place
---
No that was never my argument. The assumption i'm making is that if you were to fight back that you would reship into pvp capable ships to do so. But you cannot fight back.
---
In what way?
---
Yes that is the not playing part i was talking about.
---
&gt;So, i want just to spend money for some skin.

Why when in your own words

I only flee in fleets because of pubs. It's super boring and a waste of time. I did only the minimum so i don't get kicked out of corp

I hear you.  I've unsubbed twice, and even biomassed once.  I came back just before blackout and lived solo in a wormhole for awhile.  I also can't play it casually, with the exception of highsec shenanigans.  That's basically all I do now - log in occasionally and gank, bump, or bait.  I'm waiting to see CCP's next move here, but odds are they will screw it up, make eve safer, and I'll bail again.  Circle of life.
---
&gt; But you cannot fight back.
---
And this is simply incorrect. Mining ships can and do fight back against gankers every day.
---
you're elite sweety
---
I didn’t read any farther because that statement was so stupid I expected it to go downhill from there.
---
There are a few guides on the subreddit just have to search abyssal guides. There are some helpful youtube videos out there for specific fits. The basic part of it is building a fit that works with the type of abyssal site you'll be running. Most strategies involve focusing down battleships and neut ships while staying alive by out ranging or repping.
---
Nope, probably one of the worst players this game has.

Want to invite me? You'd probably be surprised.

Citadel: Reduce timers to just a structure timer. Change the timer to be set by the TCU timer. No tcu in system or empire space use a stront timer. Low power or no stront in structure = no timer, kill it in one go. Low power = no tether.
---
Pve: upgrade the regular anom npc ai. Adjust the spawn points. Remove drone auto aggression.

Local: use a delayed version. To reduce the load on the system blablabla lore stuff local in non empire space will update slower.

---
I don't think anything is broken. Only that its extremely dishonest to call fitting max tank to survive a gank (which isn't happening by the way, no barge can fit enough tank to survive amy gank) fighting back. 
---
There is no actual fighting that happens. Concord comes and kills the attackers it's a forgone conclusion. You are afforded no opportunity to fight back because it's already over. 
---
You cannot preempt a gank either except by not playing. You know a gank is coming? you can't go out and fight the gankers either without getting concorded and autolosing. The only reasonable actions you can take are simply avoiding the gank. And none of them qualify as fighting back.

What the fuck mate, orange looks absolutely sexy on any ship. Fuck you this post is disgraceful.
---
Sorry, was more along the  lines of pop the farming titan, however npc dredds at 60mil will take longer to pop than a boson'd site, hell might even slow down their chaining of anoms, buff the npc super damage, say along the lines of a trigg dd?
---
I've found that defense/response fleets are the way to go to be more likely to get a fight. When I was in Welp squad we only really had 3 real fights. Any other time the enemy didn't form or we stood down or aborted the op because they formed a bigger fleet.

Excuse me sir. Do you have a moment to talk about your lord and saviour, The RamJag.
---
As a person who did plenty of this in the past,
---
just at my stage of eve where i wanted to try lowsec/hisec living. (ive tried all areas, and also tried split 50/50 hi/low or null/hi or low/null etc etc etc.
---
in my 2years of lowsec/hisec, we ganked hulks and mackinaws ALOT! here is a few points of why people do it
---
1. Killmails are fun, nomatter what the case or efficiancey
---
2. people who mine in systems full of our structures in hisec, pay to rent the system or leave
---
3. im drunk, lets go explode stuffs
---
4. fleet or roam just finished, theres another one in an hour. how can a SFC keep guys online, and active until the next fleet, GANKING TIME
---
5. theres a guy mining with 500mil with of drones, if we kill his ship, we grab the drones.
---
6. i b a space pirate, i pew pew you haha die
---
7. my security status needs knocking down a bit so i can get fights easier in lowsec
---
8. eve is a sandbox, i want to push people out of hisec and afk and into other areas, ill gank them until they move and progress in the game
---
9. trolling people is fun, ganking is trolling
---
10. a miner mined somones moon, they are paying us to kill him in anyway, and giving us free ships. pew pew
---
11. from my pvp in lowsec i looted this stuff, with this i could grab some free talos and gank a frieghter for free!
---
12. oh look MY IRL FRIEND is mining in hisec, what a scrub, imma gank him
---
13. isk efficianey means nothing! these catalysts cost what? 1.2millino isk each? (unless you go t2 fit like noob gankers do :D)
---
14. EVERYTHING in eve is both teams loosing but one team loosing slightly less, thats eve, in nullsec, lowsec, small gang, ganking. the lot.
---
15. boredom
---
did I miss anything?
---
grr gon hat gon
---
Do you remember capital escalations in WH space?       
---
CCP added special spawns to the WH sites to discourage people from using capitals in running those sites.       
---
We ended up in people bringing caps just to farm those escalations.
---
CSM isn't there to present a list of changes. They are a focus group, not Junior Developers.
---
Blind Guardian - Sacred Worlds 
---
Paradise Lost - Erased
---
Why?
---
Seeing as how the CSM isn't there to advocate for change your point is moot.
---
Cheers, used to love that sorta music, and went great with the vid.
---
Gallente has Serpentis (black), Caldari has steel cardinal (also has some green ones if you absolutely don't want any red/yellow/orange), Amarr has EoM. Minmatar has no good skins but all T1 ships already looks great.
---
But you are a former/current player.
---
Next time we will drop supers and titans, so you can post about having fight in your nanokitey bullshit elite pivipi
---
The issue is more with the haw titans than dreads
---
so many worms with hg snake set implants... SMARTBOMBS ENGAGED
---
No ship can fit enough tank to be invulnerable in all situations, so that's a non-argument. 
---
You can fit anything, from a noobship to a titan, to give it no ability to fight back. That's a fitting decision. Again, non-argument.
---
There is absolutely fighting that happens. Even if you discount alts and allies, mining ships can and do fight back. It's a fitting decision, just like any ship. You are making a risk assessment and fitting accordingly. You choose where to mine, that is a decision you make. You choose to be afk or not. You choose to not pay attention to local and the grid. You choose to mine aligned or not.  These are your choices, and they directly affect your ability to fight back successfully against a gank.
---
It's the same with t1 haulers. If you choose to autopilot through Uedama with max-cargo fit and 10B in cargo, your chances of being ganked are higher than if you are atk, warping gate to gate, with a sensible cargo/tank ratio. These are decisions you make that directly affect your ability to fight back and survive a gank.
---
"Not playing" is not your only resort. Not by a long long way. Even if you don't have alts or friends.
---
To be honest it's difficult to find a target that can fight back, you find ganking target everywhere, pvp fight altmost only in some overly blopped low sec system. So at least a target is a target...
---
Must be a mass thing?  That stinks
---
Not a gallente fan, eh?
---
Those things are known for years. Why do you bother to still post it? Regarding rorqual mining, it would have already been a bit better if CCP nerfed them two years ago to their current state. That would have slowed down the proliferation of rorquals, supers, and titans a bit. The nerfs came too late. And even if the stats would always been that way rorquals would cause issues in the long run. But, yeah, why do even bother to talk about it. It's not like this isn't known for a long time.
---
It's because they are empty inside and feel pleasure in fucking with others. Some people may claim it's because they want people to learn space isn't safe and that you need to learn how to defend yourself/play the game. It's all just excuses for acting like jerks.
---
No i simply like green color.
---
1. killmails. Doesn´t matter if they are shiny, or a special ship or whatever. It´s just about the number of killmails.
---
2. tears. They are griefers. Looking for people to get mad. "collecting tears"
---
The issue with a capital removal from LS is that for new groups LS isn't worth living in already and the host of issue's it brings for people that have a cap but are not in a big bloc makes it of questionable value.
---
In this day and age of Eve, this is probably more or less true. HOWEVER... a few years back, there were quite a few corps/small alliances that specialized in being small groups of really high skill pilots taking on the larger groups. Oh, the good times. I miss you Vindicator.
---
Free yourself from bloc life

wow. That is some spinning.

**Deep Space Vault** (aka Switzerland in space)
---
*I've had this idea for a while and it sure is crazy (chances for it to be implemented are pertty much zero) but I thought I'd share it anyways. It's a rough concept and certainly needs more thought.* 
---
NPC stations are nice to store stuff and find shelter, but they aren't around everywhere and for good reasons. However, I sometimes feel like it would be cool to at least have a very basic structure, kind of like a bunker or vault that doesn't belong to anyone and would allow everyone to store some stuff inside.
---
A deep space vault is basically a huge, indestructible container floating in space. From a lore perspective, these structures would be strong enough to survive a supernova, partly because they would be placed in "deep space" far away from a system's star to minimize any negative impact if a star's evolution or a powerful weapon should ever destroy an entire star system.
---
Deep space vaults are built from very strong materials and they require fuel to maintain a number of security systems as well as the power core that provides a protective field around the structure to shield the content from any destructive forces out there. 
---
Deep space vaults don't just exist everywhere, they have to be requested by contacting a special (non-joinable) NPC corp which then reviews requests and sends construction fleets. Construction will take some time, but players may speed up the process by donating either ISK or resources.
---
Deep space vault storage capacity is limited overall (like any other container/station). Players can rent storage space, costs increase accordingly with storage space. Rented storage space is local, meaning physical access is required. Storage can be transferred to a different deep space vault for a fee, but it will take quite some time to move assets (possibly up to several weeks/months depending on where the destination vault is located). Only vault to vault transfer possible.
---
Per system, there can only be one deep space vault and overall DSV density may be limited as well, meaning players can spam requests to have one built in every single system, but in the end it will only be built in one of those systems. The availability of (NPC) stations might also be a relevant factor (e.g. many stations -&gt; less likely to get a vault built in that system/region).
---
Ideally, deep space vaults introduce a very basic storage solution in systems that otherwise do not offer any kind of security. While this increases safety on one end (in exchange for a monthly fee) it also provides new opportunities for piracy. Since ships can not dock, but only transfer cargo, (un)loading ships will be at risk for a certain time - however, it also provides the opportunity for reduced loss if a player manages to deposit valuable cargo in time.
---
**Possible limitations**
---
* max storage is limited, meaning one single player can not rent an entire deep space vault all for him/herself
---
* can not be requested in high sec
---
* possibly can only be built in neutral space (no player/NPC structures in that system)
---
**Theoretical impact**
---
* provides a bit more (optional) security for players but also content for others
---
* provides new strategic goals to actively occupy/defend neutral systems for a limited time (e.g. asset extraction)
---
* new ISK sink, for both storage space and asset relocation
---
While camping and/or suicide bombing would still work, it requires more prep and can be countered with an escort fleet if haulers are required to move assets. Since no one has a station in that system (neutral space) it also makes it more difficult to return to the fight (being at least one jump away *if* there even is a clone station nearby). 
---
While there are other options to avoid loss of cargo when flying through hostile space, deep space vaults would allow for fairly safe asset transfer once a vault has been accessed successfully. The monthly cost for renting storage and the risk for (un)loading should somewhat balance the mechanic, but there sure could be additional measures (both beneficial as well as disadvantageous) for further balance.
---
For example, players might be able to hire mercenary fleets (either player corps or NPCs) for a limited time to help defend/attack while (un)loading etc.
---
What fun is there in blobbing?
---
Yes, I'm a current player - have been for seventeen years.
---
I'm also not a Game Designer on EVE Online, so I don't have an opinion on this that I'd like to share :)
---
Re: Learning Implants. While most +learning related things have gone the way of the dinosaur, I don't think this is accurate since you can freely JC as long as a the same pod you're JCing to is in the station you're in (no JC timer). This means your implants while idling is safe and you don't lose any time. Also losing training implants is a pretty decent isk sink.
---
Also disagree with giving Biology V free. May as well remove it in that case, since it affects all combat boosters. But i like the booster instead of implants idea. Obviously this is a one or the other kind of change, so it's either implants or boosters. Buying boosters regularly would be about as annoying as constantly having to buy implants, though as if you're losing them often. Which bugs me as someone who sucks at making their own isk lol. Double their per-tier value (+2 for most basic, +4 for next, etc, etc) would definately make it worth "losing" the bonus consistantly. But might be too powerful for krabs?
---
Injected SP idea is good, but wouldn't it become pointless (nobody uses it)? Or simply just more expensive? Your logic seems sound, though.
---
For those of us who never cared for a POS; remind us what the "stront system" is ? Could base timers off ADM, aggressors set a timezone, defenders set a timezone. Half/Half and ADM leans it one way or the other?
---
Also yeah manually repairing citadels would immensely suck. Especially for smaller groups.
---
I like the concept of fireselling assets to enemies.
---
I like your Bridging Cyno (Cyno 1) idea. Means you can better predict what you'll be escalated by. Capital Cyno should be for capitals only; not subcaps. The cap-spool is an interesting idea. Idk if i like FAX being the best cyno ship or not? But then i know next to nothing about them. I assume they have the heaviest tank. I assume no changes to indy/covert cynos.
---
Also add in the 'capital' structure idea someone else posted. And most of these are good.
---
orca stinks.
---
Hello from Forsaken Empire. in Vale of the silent. :)
---
I 100% agree with this statement
---
You forgot Shittalking in your table.  Directly transferable skill.
---
Just because you can't think of a use for it doesn't mean it's useless. It just means you can't come up with a use for it. I'll give you one: instead of warping off whenever you get pointed by enemy tackle and watching for points, now your tacklers can ignore points and only warp to a ping when someone goes in to scram them. That's more uptime for your tackle, which is invaluable in any fleet fight. And that's just with a couple minutes of thought from a former junior fc.  
---
As for why you don't see garmurs often, they are the most expensive ship you can get for this role. Considering they will always get tag teamed BG the enemy tacklers, caught and killed, people just skip them. Now give them effective warp disrupt immunity by sacrificing the bcu(DMG is already negligible in fleets) and you only have to worry about people closer than 15km or so. That makes you a lot harder to kill, and also makes full faction fits with 20km heated scram and 40+ point absurdly viable. You may be too dense to think of fitting for anything other than max DPS, but for everyone else this just makes an op ship even more op.
---
My experience as a null player is opposite... but only because I'm one of the very few people doing stuff about it. My alliance, Forsaken Empire. in Vale of the Silent is a small group holding sov. We have a ton of content almost all the time. I highly suggest checking us, or similar groups out. Much more engaging, and every fleet and member counts because we measure both our systems and fleet numbers in 2 digits, not how many corps or alliances we have in our coalition.
---
You flew in there to fight? Why didn't you fight?  You dumb asses didn't go to fight. You went with little piss ant frigs. to pick low hanging fruit and play like hot-shot PvPers. Instead of whining like a lil' girl about no fights, go in there with Moas and start shooting up the place.  PS - I've seen countless posts complaining about not being able to get a fight and all along you're just wanting to post shit about how great of a  pvper you want others to think you are. Instead of protecting your kill board get a bunch of T1 BS and go fight and quit being some kind of fuck-tard.

Steps into the only Capsule on the Ship "Good Fight"
---
Well, saving all the world is more dramatic than saving, say, one child, simply because there are many children in the world.
---
Another problem here is that there's nothing dramatic about the capsuleer life since there's no risk involved.
---
depends on who you blob i guess. Felt good to outblob or straight up blob known blobbers, just to givem a taste of their own stuff
---
Blob (verb).  When you lose because the enemy brought more ships.  Not to be confused with brilliant strategy where you win by bringing more ships.
---
Hey, I've lost billions and billions of isk's worth of ship, I know the time I invested to buy those, but I've never really considered that a lost when they finally get blown up because I've enjoyed these ships while they lasted. If you enjoy mining, than whatever time you spent mining and producing/selling stuff from the minerals was what you got out of that ship. Isk is the byproduct of that enjoyment. If ISK making is your main enjoyment and you don't enjoy mining, then I'm kind of at a loss as to why you are mining in hisec. There are so many better ways to make isk, even if you want to be AFK and watching Netflix.
---
That does sound like a good time.  
---
Blobbing roaming small gangs? Not so much
---
A list of changes and the surrounding discussion is a good way to present a platform based on which people can vote for one guy and not another guy. Doesn't mean those changes have to be implemented.
---
You right, i didnt 
---
Now you made me do this, hopefully it worth it :)
---
Leave the null bloc and go join a small to medium sized group where your participation actually matters.
---
These are things, in no particular order:
---
* Add the need for food and fuel for ships and players.  You can still explain not needing food while you're logged off as 'going into hibernation' 
---
* Make it so you can 'tinker' with a BPO to make a BPC that creates a  custom module or ship that has opportunity of randomness similar to mutaplasmids.  These cannot be used in further production to create tech 2 upgrades or in any other processes.
---
* Remove all 'local' channels and only have player-driven channels (and corp channel).
---
* Redesign the dscan system to be a part of the overview
---
* You can choose to be flying anonymously or show your 'colours' to other players that are in scanning range.
---
* Corporations and alliances give out key identification that players must have as identification, these can be stolen and used by others for espionage (if you're dumb enough not to validate it further)
---
* add deployables that can give you information who is within scanning range of the deployable (can be hackable to give you data from someone else, or to take ownership, or to wipe clean any logs that you want removed)
---
* Add ability at gates to check who and what is on the other side of the gate (can be hackable and rehackable to check if it has been tampered with)
---
* Allow people to build stuff in space even if it serves no purpose (i.e. piece together their own things from smaller blocks).  I literally want minecraft in space.
---
* Improve the agent missions so that they always serve a purpose.  i.e. haulers have an effect on FW through missions by resupplying the frontline, research agents change the balance of tech1 vs. tech2 or even tech3 gear available for npcs.
---
* Make a real strategic reason why empire space is only high-sec and why security drops off, and why the different factions might be trying to claim parts from each other rather than expanding high-sec further into low-sec.
---
* Make the security of a system be player driven rather than set in stone, this can be implemented with:
---
* Corps can assign themselves as protectors of a system (concord automatically assigned in high-sec but other corps can assign themselves as well).
---
* The player has to 'call for help'.  If help arrived within 'x' seconds average for a month, then that affects the security rating.
---
* The corp that helped gets payment from insurance (so someone faster than concord will get part of the money depending on ratio of damage done).  all players have to get 'aid insurance' if they want to use an insured 'call for help'.  This would be connected  to the player in the form of a tax in high-sec, but connected in the form of 'insurance' in low or null, where responders can see how much they get for helping a person in need dpending on the level of insurance.
---
i guess the elites wouldve been pleased with "dropping on" and "being dropped" :)
---
Not going to happen.
---
Firstly no other company is as passionate about a product as Sqaure Enix were with ff14.  They literally put everything on the line to correct their mistakes risking the company in the process instead of abandoning it and moving on.
---
They you have the fact that no one else is capable of pulling of what Yoshi managed to do.  He was so passionate he had his vision of what it should be and Sqaure Enix basically handed him the right to do what he saw best and gave his team the time to do it.
---
Whilst rebuilding the game they didn't let the old one stagnate and instead tied the rebuild into the game.
---
Simply put no other company or project lead has the passion or ability to do what ff14 did, it is 100% a one in a million turn around.
---
Look at Bioware and anthem. "oh game is shit, not what we promised, well time to strip the dev team down to bare minimum and move everyone off the project, scrap the planned road map, release minimal content whilst hyping up the next product"
---
Also applies to flying nano comps.
---
and positive green/red isk ratio on zkill
---
Sure, that guy was meming on purpose, but not everybody knew this at the time. It seemed like a genuine over-reaction.
---
&gt;Why do you enjoy making people mad?
---
Like I said, the over-reaction they make is funny. I destroyed their space pixels and some act as if I had killed their dog or something.
---
Haven't seen Wing Commander, but Starship Troopers is a Fascism-glorifying masterpiece.
---
Do you even realize how difficult it is to adapt a book for screen? Under most circumstances all verbalized thoughts of all characters must be removed entirely and most dialogs must be reduced to 1-2 minutes tops, even better 20 seconds, because that's how a movie remains dynamic. We aren't in 1950s ffs
---
amen
---
&gt; So, if you have engaged in this activity, why? I'm genuinely curious, because I don't understand at all. 
---
Because they can, it's a game, and there's nothing wrong with it.  I've trolled high sec players with criminal minds by tanking up a Mackinaw, boosts, and used implants. It really pissed them off they tried it 2x more times.  Same effect.  
---
Make friends and bait them (e.g. park an Orca beside you and switch other barges into logi and combat ships). 
---
There's ways to counter them. Forget about paying attention, and hiding, stand your ground and shoot masked people in the face if they come to your house..."in-game".
---
Right back at ya how about you don't be a condescending ass lol. If you have something constructive to say say it :)
---
At this point i would not call it ganking. You merely took out the competition!
---
It even involved you two interacting.
---
I'd tenfold rather be killed by someone i harassed rather than just someone roaming by
---
Yeah, so the real question is not why do people gank high sec miners, but why they are high sec miners ?
---
where you smartbombed? between dieing and the animation showing, strange things can happen
---
Yeah, mine gas ... at least.
---
The people that require spoon feeding are people you don’t want when push comes to shove
---
The only one I somewhat liked was the Ghostbird skin, all others really aren't great imho.
---
I wish there was a way to at least be able to select between a set of base colors, wouldn't even mind paying extra for such a feature.
---
Same for me! Started EVE 2003 and every time I joined a cancerous voicechat or read on reddit my hatred in mankind increased - now im sitting in HR
---
once he shoots yuo you get an engagement timer. if you then reship, and go back (maybe get a friend to bump him so he cant warp) once you tackle him, the engagement timer resets while your agressed on him.
---
get him to shoot, get friend to bump, reship, kill. he wont shoot again
---
Cant even get the tagline right... that's how we know you aren't in corp
---
i mean, and orca hit hard, but its still like 450dps? not exactly scary to a cruiser never mind battleship.
---
i think buffer megathron vs orca mega wins. no matter how you fit the orca
---
Or just have fun and laugh ? One day I gank a miner the next day I will be ganked while mining. I don't feel any superior lol
---
So very true, I used to like match of the day years ago in that they showed you condensed highlights of games with only the good bits.    I can no longer watch football as I get seriously bored at the number of people throwing themselves to the floor and rolling around for ages before getting up gingerly and then running around with nothing wrong with them mere seconds later.
---
you're proposing another idea on something you don't understand again :)
---
Isn’t “The Expanse” inspired by EVE lore?
---
Thats fair, enjoy you game :D
---
XLASB on an orca is embaressing. its a cruiser tank
---
&gt; I'd take Philly ~~even~~ preferably
---
&gt;I bought omega yesterday (**got isk from null scanning but i hate this activity so much and i will never do it again**)
---
If u lose against that strategy, is prob because you don't have a well elaborated strategy to counter the n+1 strategy and just wants a easy win. same way goes to the man that use the n+1 strategy.
---
The issue is not every ship needs DPS to be effective. Hell not every ship needs scan res.
---
The penalty should be AGILITY. You want to be able to warp out safely? Okay but it will take 30 seconds to warp.
---
Welcome to Eve post-supercap umbrella and post-citadels. The best way to protect your own territory is to deny any and all fights that come in. All of the corps that used to roam in bloc space simply stopped roaming as they either started getting dunked on by supers, or completely ignored as people simply docked up or the blocs arranged to be blued by the roamers. What's the result? Any organic fights that used to happen frequently in bloc space is gone. The only fights that remain are ganking ratters and miners (which are boring for both parties), organized subcap fights and massive bloc-action fights (which are still very rare).
---
True Eve is dead, remnants of which only exist in some wormhole corps, lowsec corps and small null groups.
---
This right here is the problem. Nobody wants to lose anything. They only want to squash the enemy from perfect safety, Krab in perfect safety, and complain if anything changes that makes them more vulnerable. 
---
Null sec has a cultural problem. Until it gets fixed, nothing is going to change.
---
Wrong.
---
I actually have the most awful kb because i feel absolutly no satisfaction blobbing anyone but have the greatest feelings taking down a few ships before getting blobbed.
---
So i keep welping awfully expensive ships just to try to fight blobs alone.
---
So this.
---
Thanks falcon.
---
Being in the sig doesn't change your corp and alliance. You will still be avoided most of the time. The exception is Pathfinders and wormhole stuff.
---
ill try your tactic when  i get next chance
---
In all seriousness though this is one reason I never get SKINs for ships. You can't tell me that they make more with people farting about buying 10 more PLEX in Perimeter than they lose in people who would just buy the thing in the store if it wasn't for the need to:A) going through extra steps; and/or B) feel cheated and ripped off.
---
Step two is wrong, you warp that minmatar ship to the novice plex where it belongs.
---
never thought that good old Hansi and crew would work well together with spaceships shooting lasers at each other. but somehow they do.
---
A likely story. **WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO HIDE??**
---
or you know that NC isn't actually in NSI.
---
Are you by any chance Catbert?
---
Would love to see hot pink hello kitty skin 😂
---
WTB pretty much every ironblood skin.
---
I aint paying 3 bill each. Put them up on the damn  plex store. Just take my money ccp its right there. All you gotta do is check a box on the database.
---
FREE FUCKIN MONE FOR YOU CCP
---
A titan won't be killed by NPC. Titan ratting is not as lucrative as people think (around the same as a super) because you have the DD reload timer.
---
If you add dread npcs, titan ratting will become extremely profitable.
---
I do not see any problem having supercarriers and titans being able to make money by ratting, but it should involve separate anomaly type that cannot be boson'd and actually are capable of holding the titan/super in place for some time, like we have tackling frigates in other anomalies (HIC npcs ?), plus capital npc so they at least lose some HP.
---
But that doesn't tell you who is best for the position. Putting in a ton of shit ideas and you get people like Olmeca Gold who can't listen to criticism. Just because someone has an idea doesn't make them an expert. I mean, look at all of the idea threads lately. All written by idiots. It takes one to know one, trust me, I'm a fucking expert on the matter.

&gt; Hello from Forsaken Empire. in Vale of the silent. :)
---
Seeing a constellation of small and mid-sized groups have a noticeable chunk of null carved out was the best byproduct of the Goons glassing Tribute and Vale.  I'm excited to see what comes of that region of space.
---
Post this in the megathread. Your post has been removed.
---
Okay, fair point.
---
Yeah, the obvious point is for people to buy the next big pack (which makes CCP more money) and have some left over which get's CCP's foot in the door to incentivise the next Skin purchase (to make even more money).

It's just fine in lowsec assuming you are paying attention to local and are smart enough to warp off. That particular fit is idiotic though

It may sound strange, but go do PvE on some alts, when you raise ADM on your system, and system you rat will have standing out color on Dotlan hunters will come.  
---
Then form some small gang to defend \[2-4 ppl\]. Best fights ever. Before blackout I raised my toon from total 0/100 crab to 51/49 DAN 50/50 SOLO in half year. Doing PvE is great content creator.
---
You guys known this guy doesn't rat and he's just another edgy poor hunter post. 
---
Like why does it feel this sub is filled with bloomer millennials looking for attention
---
That's a good thing. Eve can be pretty mentally damaging. That's why the community calls each other autistic.
---
You should thank your coalition leaders for optimising all the fun out of the game
---
Whoops didn't read that part my bad ^^
---
THANKS BILL ITS ALL I CAN ASK FOR.
---
EDIT: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger
---
This is what happens when everyone decides they don't like risk and you end up with the entire population collapsed into 3 big blobs.
---
Here is a list from a real nobody, just for stuff that would make things easier (or less annoying)
---
* Volume slider in settings (and other sliders) should allow you to click at a certain points, instead of having to grab and slide it.
---
* There should be an option to auto stack items, by default. Dragging an item in or a production job should auto stack. Even recalling probes, they should stack.
---
* You should be able to Quit to the Character selection screen, preventing having to relaunch the session to sign into another character.
---
* You can "stack all" in an Orca bay remotely (from another ship), but you cannot drag an item to stack, this works when piloting it.
---
* Certificate mastery (I actually reference it sometimes) should use the top skilled weapon/tanking spec/drone faction types, I have a mastery skill of 2 in my Tengu, but ignoring stuff I don't use makes it lower (like cannons, etc).
---
* Add a sort by (for players) in chats. Sort by status and alphabetical would be good.
---
* Change category in market when a breadcrumb is clicked (blue prints / ships/ etc) currently the bread crumbs are not clickable (on a search).
---
I occasionally highsec two Orcas and they're fit to deal with any ganking. As a matter of fact, if win that encounter pretty much every time unless it was worth more to destroy my two Orcas than the value of the KMs.
---
oh I didn't give you gold, my money is in Robinhood
---
.. when you have to *explain* this to people, to me it's a sign that the game is permanently fucked by human nature and delusion.
---
no need to be bashful
---
&gt; relegate yourself to surfdome as a F1 monkey
---
Can you imagine a world where the masses expect satisfaction but are not prepared or equipped to put in the effort when required.  
---
Oh shit….
---
I'm not quite entirely sure that high-budget production couldn't capture the spirit of EVE - it pretty much depends on how good the script is, but I like the idea of doing animation.
---
As per it happening  - it really isn't THAT hard. 
---
Pearl Abyss is probably interested in expanding playerbase, meaning that they probably won't mind sharing 3d models and such, thus slashing production costs, and the existing playerbase is wealthy and involved enough to crowdfund some $500k to $1kkk which is more than enough for animation and voice acting
---
And then get bosoned by a titan on some gate
---
Before capsules were a thing it wasn’t any different from any other space-themed story
---
The details of that interests me greatly. I solo lived in a C2 Wolf Rayet for a while.
---
I agree people who have taken a temporary break under asset safety should come back to having their stuff blown up.
---
New players should have to slowly progress. So what if they can't fly the fleet comp. Fuck em.
---
Ackchyally, the capsules is inside the capsule while piloting the ship and there are escape pod for the crew.
---
Space:
---
Please dont add anymore space!
---
Asset Safety:
---
 Heres my issue with asset safety. I know a lot of dudes especially in the military that with a moments notice have to move out or ship out. Not giving them a lot of time to get their RL stuff to let alone there in-game stuff settled. Asset safety I believe is kind of a need is a game where most of its players have to do RL.
---
Trig ships:
---
NERF bat hard. 
---
Havens/Sanctums:
---
 That's a hard sell man that means you cant really make isk unless u multibox or your dudes are on. Not everyone is in or wants to be in a 10000 man alliance.
---
Are you mainlining testosterone?
---
Who is Uwe Boll? Should I contact him?
---
Imperfect Intel means you cannot make perfect decisions, but you can expend more effort to get slightly better Intel (scouts, spies, etc)
---
A fight isn't a mistake, it's the best choice you have give your available data.
---
Mostly.
---
I think it's a vicious cycle.
---
They think "I'll learn to do that later once I have the skills, in the meantime I'll mine so I have money, oh but if I train these skills I can mine better."
---
I don't disagree with him.  But I think it is on CCP to adjust the reward along with the risk.
---
It's been a while.
---
nullsec alliances are more about pve, and your experience doesn't differ from any other nullblob
---
Npc sov pockets in or within direct jump range of every sov null region.
---
This thread is moot.
---
How can anything in this game change when you have null sec alliance leaders like mittani and others using their position to influence thousands of others on how this game should be played. They use fireside chats to tell their members things like "well CCP is trying to hurt us directly again. boo CCP. we have to adapt and oh no, we need to do this now". With this kind of manipulation, anything CCP tries that hurts the large alliances will face immediate unsubbing, shit posting, and this game is dying threads. 
---
For years, you have alliance leaders telling every line member to get into super capitals and titans, pretty much focusing on nothing else at all. So now you have thousands of players who are sinking so much time into getting into these ships that they ignore 99.9% of the other play styles. Newbros going directly into these mega coalitions and being told almost immediately to train into these biggest ships is a problem. 
---
The amount of meta gaming, vote brigading for csm positions, and heavy handed backlash against anything that threatens even the tiniest bit if security null sec has is what is killing this game. 
---
You want to fix this game, do something to break up these mega coalitions. Make capitals only capable of shooting other capitals again. Remove docking access for titans and supers. Make structures easier to deal with. Make time zone tanking a thing of the past. Make it so an entire coalition can't sit in one region and make countless amounts of isk with no resource depletion or other over farming penalties. CCP is going to have to make some hard changes. Changes that are going to fucking piss off the alliance leaders. Changes to make null sec dangerous again and wars easier and less alarm clocking. When the alliance leaders start throwing a tantrum because their game play is going to get harder, that's a sign something is being done right. 
---
Alliance leaders in mega coalitions will say that changes like these will only hurt the small alliances, and yeah, they will hurt too, but it's also going to make life harder for mega coalitions. You can't make game altering changes without affecting everyone in a play style. In this case, we need to change sov holding null sec entities which includes smaller alliances.
---
Remove attributes, attribute remaps and attribute enhancing implants. SP is now gained at a steady rate that's equivalent to the current optimal attributes you can get. You could still get boosters that boost sp-acquisition rate that remain with the character after death.. This just adds another layer of confusion for new players, forces every player to have a training clone and always jump clone every time they want to pvp. It's a useless system that only adds complexity without adding any depth to Eve online.
---
Hory shet 
---
I wonder what went wrong
---
That's why I said limit it to one per month so they don't spam shit ideas.
---
It would add new mechanics (new things to generate content) and would incentivize corporations to remain in the areas that had their resources depleted.
---
Think of it as a redo on the citadel update.  They can’t just remove citadels that’ve been built in null.  So instead just create a “new” null that citadels can’t be built in.
---
Kinda that idea
---
A place for the big boys to roll when asset safety is a gonner
---
I’m not sure that I ever heard this title before
---
The only thing I don't agree with is cynos on rookie ships unless you just mean the industrial cyno for jump freighters. If that's the case, then yeah. Good changes
---
I think there's room for both? Like you can kill someone and still be cool about it, or you can kill some one and go out of your way to be a dick to them in the process.
---
Thank you for your valuable input.
---
No because nullsec has already become too safe.  Yes I propose an expansion of highsec.  But along with that I propose new nullsec systems that citadels cannot be built in.  This brings back the danger of nullsec that was present before the citadel update.
---
Perhaps bring back the old sov system for these new systems.
---
No bosons is dead now. Cyno change. Kek
---
holy fuck that’s actually pretty impressive, I’ve never seen one that sweaty in the wild
---
How did we ever managed to go without it for 13 years and for most of that time have an uptrending pcu without alphas?
---
Do you get satisfaction from the win, even when it's easy? Or is it more about getting past the conflict, and back to other interests / more rewarding things? 
---
Honest question - I'm trying to see other perspectives, as I've always been the idiot chasing the shakes/goodfight, and eternally frustrated (wrong game, honestly).
---
&gt; That's a hard sell man that means you cant really make isk unless u multibox or your dudes are on. Not everyone is in or wants to be in a 10000 man alliance.
---
Go to your staging and scrounge up 10 dudes, if your alliance can't manage that how did it take space in the first place?
---
OP, EVE is a game full of sociopaths. They love making others miserable. That's the whole reason why they do what they do. They think your misery is funny and enjoy it.
---
If I were you, I'd question more as to why you'd want to play with an online community that acts like this in the first place.
---
For widely varying values of dick, I guess. Same as you can be ganked and be cool about it, or be ganked and be a racist/misogynist/homophobe/psycho about it.
---
Absolutely brilliant ideas. Some of these changes would definitely get me and some friends to come back.
---

---
I'm a little salty when I get blobbed by 10-30. I never drop caps and I dont roam or meet dreamers with anyone that has a cyno lit. It's usually me against 5-7. Sometimes a buddy comes along. I fly solo hypes and Bhaals. I understand I fly powerful ships, but if you need 10 people to fight me, it's not a fight you should take.
---
I cancelled both of my subs because fun fights are just too hard to find.
---
/r/fittings
---
Its a fair point. All I was trying to state was while you are coming from a large group mentality, some smaller groups have a different mentality.
---
lol. Because people had no choice but to die before. Now they don't .
---
Well its not much more concurrent player count is now bellow 20k
---
Honestly, the only part that really bothers me about ganking is the value inversion.  You can welp quite a few catalysts before it equals the value of a single hulk, but it only takes a handful to do it.  
---
Sure, you're losing your stuff to Concord for the kill, but the risk/reward ratio seems skewed to me.  So it's not even the ganking, it's just the relative balance of the ships involved I'd like to see tweaked.
---
That being said, I don't take it personally, because eve. Some one always wants to kill you, it's just the way things go.
---
Entosis would be nice if, instead of needing to spool up everytime, the node could be 'primed' by one cycle instead. While also having a ~30 second cooldown before it needs to be primed again. 
---
That way ECM can still force you off it, but if you can get back on it before that cooldown, you don't need another spool cycle.
---
Your coalition stifles content (and so does mine but im ok with it). Make a choice and leave if its too boring. 
---
But stop complaining on reddit youre not entitled to large fleet fights on the fleets conveniently fitting your schedule.

---
There is no fights because there is no war. There is no war because there is no conflicts. There is no conflicts because alliance leaders won't risk their income from RMT.
---
Having a 'bad killboard' is a gift that keeps on giving. Get more fights that way, people love to engage people who lose all the time.
---
thanks ! i'll take a look there :)

The only thing that's true for in your list is marauders. Even the warp speed one is dominated by the accel/decel cap which may be more than a simple numbers tweak.
---
Im fine with rewards being adjusted as long as you can't farm it 23/7 365 for evry member in your alliance.
---
&gt;The issue with a capital removal from LS is that for new groups LS isn't worth living in already

Probably has something to do with getting caps and supers dropped on them all the time.

No wonder. Death of Drone Region Federation was exactly the same as dissolution of USSR. 6 years worth of alliance assets ended up in the hands of a few XIX higher-ups.

Uwe Boll is former 'Director' that usually took some game franchise and  ~~turned it into a movie~~  completely butchered it. Basically some sort of VAT-write off scheme that used to work in Germany. He was quite prolific until he retired few years back.
---
To be fair, it's a pain to mine in a belt when 8 NPC Skiffs are gobbling up all your rocks.

That's what imperfect intel did, it just didn't come along with any motivation to accept 40% the effeciency of previous-era pve, so all the cowards stayed docked.

I reckon the best thing you can do is download the client, sign up for an Alpha account and jump in.

The New Player Experience is a million times better than when I started and you already know one of the best places to come and ask questions.

Just remember that the salt floweth on /r/Eve regardless of what CCP do / don't do and the game is always dying, even when it isn't.
---
If nothing else you owe it to yourself to make one of those stories :D
---
Had my time wasted last night by a wormhole gang who upshipped against a kitchen sink, then wouldn’t leave the safety of their wormhole grid.
---
Who the fuck wants to fight risk averse babies?
---
"Coding" listed under ingame skills? Do we play the same game?
---
You logged in and won. Take a trophy. Sounds fun.
---
Find access to lowsec FW for you small fleets that you fc. we daytrip from sovnull to fw space and get fights in black rise all the time.
---
I have learned pretty quickly that unless wormholers can control the engagement they will fuck off and leave
---
I've had hundreds of hours wasted waiting for nullblocs to form a kitchen sink, just to form bullshit, so it happens.
---
You've got a great attitude.  To your point on the value, don't forget the security loss and/or cost of tags.  I podded a guy last night and it basically wiped out any positive standing I had.  To get serious with ganking, you have to dedicate an alt to it, so that alt is locked down (unless you pay the isk for security tags). 
---
But your point is well taken - I disagree, but only because there are other barges available.  A skiff or procurer is nearly gank proof, unless I dedicate multiple characters.  As a solo ganker, they're off the table for me.  Just don't fly a hulk and you're basically safe from me.  It's a trade off between safety and yield, and that seems pretty balanced to me at the moment.

No. All forms of blob are a cancer
---
if you want ccp to stop by you just need to start your own meetup. none of the fanfest stops were CCP making their own somewhere, they were all pre-existing player meetups that they pitched in to help with.
---
Not gonna comment on every single thing I disagree with but let me just make a counter argument.
---
&gt;Removes the ability for supers to blap subcaps at will with their deep fighter bays. Now they can only kill other caps and battleships that get too stupidly close
---
If this becomes a thing then conversely subcaps should not be able to kill supers. Like a fleet of bombers popping out of a WH should not be able to kill supers. Want to kill supers/titans? Commit caps of your own.
---
Grath has been happy as shit since he’s been in Waffles.
---
That's great never knew that existed
---
This limited experiment was costly both for CCP and all people playing this game. We lost a lot of subs.           
---
Many people also lost faith in CCP capability of putting healthy changes into the game - and recent flood of ideas and constant list "what need to be fixed" is the best example of this.
---
You forgot to clap.
---
Really good stuff here. However, rather than putting hard limits that reduce nullsec PVE profitability, a depletion system I believe would be easier to implement, and solve many of these problems dynamically. This could be accomplished using 2 systems:
---
#Ratting
---
Dynamic sec status. Increased ratting reduced pirate activity, which generally leads to the system becoming safer. Similar to the formula for calculating the military ADM, every 500 or so rats killed *increases* the security of that system by 0.1, affecting its security band over time, and thus the number of anoms that spawn there, escalation chances, etc, over time. Every system has a fixed low-end, and is treated as a maxed-out upgraded system by default, however Ihub upgrades can be used to force the band lower or increase the number of rats needed to raise the sec status, rather than just cause more anoms to spawn. Proper management of a system keeps the sec low and the anoms flowing, abuse of that system leads to anoms drying up. 
---
#Mining
---
Similarly, abuse of R64s, Colossals, and the max concentration of mining in a few systems (made worse by cynogeddon), leads to the successive yields being lower, then more valuable resources being drained as junk ores take their place, and longer moon pulls being required to produce the same sized belts. Each system has a natural replenishment rate which can be effected by Ihub upgrades.
---
Good alliances will introduce crop rotation across their sov, and keep their umbrella mobile to maximize their yields. Bad alliances will abuse their land until it yields nothing in return, and be forced to conquer new sov or become semi-nomadic, or going so far as to raid their neighbors for resources. Thus, we get true "resource wars" as scarcity drives conflict, which consumes resources and leads to even more scarcity, when not being managed properly. 
---
Bonus feature: "Salt the earth". Create a method for defenders to accelerate the above processes and raze their own lands, at the cost of not getting the ore/bounty in return, to make the space unprofitable to live in by the invading force for several weeks to months afterwards.
---
You’re fine, Titans are the meta just start working towards it. If your Titan can’t get the job done just add more Titans till it’s done ez game.
---
Thx! 
---
I knew my posting have positive effect on this subreddit.
---
Perhaps it is possible to know your ship would look cool in a different color scheme without actually having seen said color scheme?
---
&gt; You just lack knowledge and balls. 
---
You're half right. I do lack knowledge about small-scale kity fighting. It's not what I do, nor what I want to be doing. As a result, these dudes that do that sort of thing 24/7 will always be better at it than me.
---
Not engaging them has nothing to do with balls, however. I realize it's just a knee-jerk response to try and get people mad and stupid so they'll feed, but the reality is that taking a *equal* fight on your enemy's terms is a very bad plan. It's their show at that point, and they will have the advantage. 
---
Which is an odd thing to ask of people, when they have the means to flip that advantage in their favor. Why would we give up the advantage when they would never consider doing that themselves?
---
&gt;strat ops
---
&gt;coalition
---
I think I know why you aren't finding good stuff.
---
holy frak.. I love you!!!
---
username checks out
---
Damn that looks like a good fight for sure
---
That was my original plan... just realised that I have no idea how to play this game anymore. Kindof sad that a big part of my life 8 years ago is now so dead to me.
---
Good riddance we lost nothing of value. If people can't handle the game when they're forced out of their comfort zone they belong in another game.
---
Not really, there is no alliance level income meaning new groups can't do SRP meaning for corps living in lowsec costs money but doesn't gain you any leading to LS corps depending on often a couple of rich dudes or past wealth to keep the lights on.
---
&gt; Now tell us how long it took you to rat that 500mil in nullsec
---
He played 48 hours straight and docked 7 times from the baddies. It was SUPER easy to make SWEET cash. I hope you know what that means, because nobody knows or cares.
---
Removing assets could be quite problematic.    
---
Because remove :          
---
* all stuff?           
---
* from certain point ?         
---
* gained in specific way ?          
---
Like imagine yourself effect if people bought plex from CCP sold it on market injected char and bought hull for it, or the guy that worked to to get to the same point for years.                 
---
So balancing the industry is much better aspect.         
---
Like honestly CCP we need isk sinks , add 15bil as build cost for each new Titan.           
---
Line reduction ... yes please.
---
THAT guy is a GSF Diplo?  Ihr seid am arsch alter xD
---
Since when does Warp Disruption Field Generator II with the Disruption script cancels MJD (mwd still fine)   
---
Did I miss something, has it always been like that ?
---
Not wanting to disparage certain jobs here. But a "role in IT" can be anything from first level support to multi-huge-project-manager.
---
So if you already got your hopes up that mentioning you playing Eve at least 8 hours a day will be your career opener, you will probably be disappointet.
---
Fighters, corvettes and such are almost useless compared to mainline ships. If your in a battle cruiser fight and start killing corvettes or frigates, the other side is going to laugh before killing half your fleet.
---
This is a good list like many
---
I don’t like everything but the majority is good.
---
At least then you could theoretically attack the pos and force them to react. It's become far too easy to just turtle up and disappear at no cost. There's almost no way to force a spontaneous fight except maybe entosising, or ganking a PVE ship. Strategic assets are practically invincible now.
---
Reffing a structure poses no immediate danger, and the defender gets all kinds of time to form up a defense fleet for the timer, so rather than a spontaneous battle forced by the invader, it's a pitched battle at a time the defender is already comfortable with.
---
Cynos are different now though. 
---
Wormholers won’t engage stuff unless it warps in [one by one 😂🤣](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004716/201909180200/). 
---
Then [they’ll upship and kill the one retard in a fleet](https://zkillboard.com/related/31000704/201909180400/)who hangs out on either side of their wormhole.
---
If you bring something they 1.) can’t control or 2.) try to force them into a situation they can’t control (see: away from wormhole entrance grid), they run. 
---
Tldr: unless they can holetank, whers aren’t interested in a fight.
---
Aww that's terrible. I feel like since you don't want to make that much you should probably be doing belt ratting in a myrmidon instead. You could also mine veldspar??
---
Or, go farm data site escalations and make several billion a day?
---
I don't know really, it does sound like you are mad about something though. Should people be capped at say 30 million isk per hour maximum? 50? 100? Where would you set the income cap? Does the excess go to special interests groups, or maybe to welfare fund?
---
&gt;exploration is chance
---
Will it not average out on the long run?
---
when its at a point where legacy can outform WC in autz prime this hard than all those posts about dinobrains crying cause they dont find \*small gang\* content are even more cringe. looks like goons went with low numbers. only 60 on the killmail. iam certainly not a frat fan but the longer goons and tapi work together and all those low tier legacy alliances are sucking tapi dick the game will go down further into the shitter. let the downvoting commence
---
Because roaming gangs are equipped to deal with large dickstars and deathstars.
---
Good guys win again
---
Lol goons almost had as many people there as test
---
I don’t get the hate for arranging a fight.  The lost ships are still real, and its more fun than an hour long roam and finding nothing.
---
The only thing I could think of is “there’s no stakes” but a roam doesn't really have “stakes” either.
---
Fleet fights are boring, and at the end of the day, also mean jack shit.  IF there was a reason to fight over sov then maybe it would be worth the effort, but there isn't.
---
Came back and i'm planning to stay for a bit and i don't care about blackout.

Honestly if you haven't figured out exploration in a few days, try another career and revisit it later cuz that shit is easy.

Hi, u/NazAlGhul

[I think you may enjoy this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSjFVH2Zc5E)
---
So far the suggestions they chose to listen to have resulted in an exodus of players and done plenty of damage.
---
I think it's best they just ignore suggestions from now on.
---
Most arranged content is won on undock, the only case that it's actually interesting is when it's two equally experienced groups. 
---
I've FC'd arranged content in both nullsec and wormholes. Nullsec is trash T1 battlecruiser whelps, wormholes are more interesting with experienced groups armor brawling.
---
Was just about to post the same.  Dual boxing a Rattle and Gila gets me somewhere between 300-350m an hour.
---
lol
---
well trolled there
---
here's a better one, CCP copied Tradewars in the first place
---
They should bring more for better fights

There is no reason to show up generally unless the structure is on a hull timer and even then it's 50/50 if a fight will happen.  Fort and smaller for most coalitions are throw-away.  Best thing to do is once the citadel is saved or whatever the fleets main purpose is.... go to one of the coalitions staging and poke the nest.  Yeah, don't do that with a munnin or eagle fleet as leadership gets smh faced whelping those  - but smaller T1 cruisers, T3D's, assault frigate fleets, go for it.  
---
I'd say 60-75% of F1 monkeys (and I use that term in the most loving way possible) are there for their participation not actually fighting.  What has me depressed is much of that 60-75% pay little attention to the fleet because they've got 6 other accounts Roqual mining in the background and watching netflix.
---
This is not how industry works.         
---
EVE is a product that will not exist without customers.
---
did they get mad at you for saying you liked the blackout falcon 
---
blink twice then scratch your ear on the next eve pulse if Hilmar is holding you hostage
---
You forget it's a fight for survival of Test Culture and Civilization as well as the TAPI way of life.
---
You don't think you can undock without arranged content? That's a shame.
---
About our current options to create a deep safe spot..
---
1. Bookmark the center of the sun and bounce away;  
---
2. Stay in abyssal Dead Space when the down time hits.
---
..any of those still work today?
---
- All citadels belonging to FW groups banned from adding members of enemy FW to the access list.
---
Does that fix the exploit, or does it need to go further and say that Access lists for all FW Citadels are restricted to friendly militia member. 
---
The second option might make FW space too restrictive for people who are there to fight people without necessarily being FW.
---
It will exist if 20 percent of the customers throw a hissy fit and leave which is an absurd overestimation. Other players will fill in the gaps in the market.
---
agreed
---
Battleships used to warp at 3. Then they got nerfed down to 2 when they were already medicore.
---
Shouldn't be any ACLs on structures in FW space otherwise they'll be exploited. No way around it unfortunately.
---
How does your math work out?
---
Even assuming polarized bombers that do 850 DPS each, 850*20*60 is only a million DPM, 20 M EHP takes 20 minutes to chew through with that fleet. If your solo titan can't get backup in 20 minutes you deserve to die.
---
The games underlying mechanics do not produce the results CCP and players are looking for. There is no natural way to generate fights, fights don't last long enough, there is no reason to travel far then you can stay in system and make money, and much, much more. 
---
If CCP isn't willing to push things that makes the game worth playing rather than simply grinding for isk, then that's all you are doing. Players should not be solely relied upon to generate content, there should be other drivers. Fleet fights are fun, but a fleet can warp away in an instant, then cloak. That's not fun.
---
&gt; spiked space tomato 
---
Ok now I want CCP to make a BLT skin.
---
Can we please pin this post or another one similar so CCP can see it and it is not fogotten in a couple of days?

---
?
---
CCP is doing that with changes to cynos and blackout. People just threw a hissy fit. Cyno changes force more impactful engagements with a harder time to counter escalate forever. Blackout forces fleets to meet more often rather than avoiding each other based on local spikes.
---
I made that much yesturday spinning muh ship in jita. 
---
You can do level 4s and get the same isk.
---
Hollywood quality movie, not Hollywood quality script lol
---
Well having some control over ACL is a good thing, say there are assholes in your militia that you don't like despite being on "the same team", and you don't want them in your citadels. Without ACLs you can't keep them out of your structures.
---
Well retention numbers for eve are quite low.            
---
It is not that 20% customers will be recovered in a day, week or a month.          
---
20% customer recovery for eve is like a 2-3year process, assuming that we have uptrend in gaining those and we don't.
---
Amazing what happens when 2 Mega coallions and a 3rd smaller one team up to fight 1
---
:bigthink:
---
For some it's about the kbstats. Apparently.
---
On moments like this i suspect that we could be blue.
---
It has nothing to do with game design or problems of being able to "switch characters quickly". It's an ancient architectural issue in the client. "Return to character select" would be a huge engineering project for a tiny benefit.
---
You mean panfam teaming up with Winter?
---
Npc level pvp players who don't understand there's different playstyles besides their own.
---
Quite low compared to what? They are low but maybe they're the best we've seen we don't have a frame of reference from other games or previous stats from EVE. 
---
Retention is also not impacted by blackout or cyno changes those are changes that affect established players in Null. Most people wouldn't be joining a null block in their first week or even month.
---
It\`s probably the \`\`oh it\`s not a random encounter, no thrill of the hunt, no stakes and so on, it\`s just staged and it feels fake, I don\`t like it\`\` mentality.
---
While I understand that, I still think its better than ship spinning or flying hours and hours in the hopes of getting to blow something up and pray they don\`t dock up waiting for you to leave or blob you.
---
When asked for comments, the FRT FC said "bleep bloop"
---
But if the rewards were increased, maybe those people would undock for the increased isk. 
---
 If you turn up the rewards while decreasing safety, that's fine. If you increase safety, decrease rewards. 
---
This goes for anything. That's why I don't mind that t4 and t5 abyss used to have a suspect timer. It should come back. You want 500 Mill an hour from abyss? You risk getting tackled and killed. 
---
Wormholes need some work. As well. Im hoping an increased spawn rate of wormholes will add to that risk factor. A higher chance of a wandering wormhole opening while you are farming would be nice. 
---
Faction warfare needs a lot of love. 
---
Mission running in high sec is one of the most balanced pve styles. You don't risk much but you also don't make much. Blitzing at Max efficiency in high sec only nets you close to 200 Mill an hour and let's face it, not a lot of people are blitzing those besides soe missions. 
---
 If you want to turbo Krab and build that wallet, add a little more risk to it. Maybe make all those bounties come in a tag format that can be looted. It would require you to have an mtu out which you would have to scoop or leave behind. You can see me coming to get it so you have time, but it's slightly more risk for the current reward.

---
How is it mocking?  You really want to see some Soviet and Nazi propaganda movies
---
Yeah that's probably true. The main thing would be like, dont hit it with some buffer thorax and expect to win.
---
It is my belief you are missing my point.
---
Sounds like a viable plan XDXDXDXDXD
---
Just my thought aswell.
---
I dont see a batphone.
---
Look up "are we the baddies" on YouTube
---
As I mention in another comment here. Yes it was probably some programmers oversight that made it so it's not easy to do. BUT let me phrase it this way. If i can write a script to click a button on my screen when a trigger says so.. they can make it relaunch a client from the client. Now I could see the login from the launcher being an issue. But clicking the right account button on the launcher isn't hard. And there is no amount of technology impending this.
---
I'm not saying a real solution is easy or even that they should. I'm simply saying it's CCPs choice not a limitation. They could fix it if they wanted to. but as you mention it would be a big project unless they go the easy script method (*which I could be downplaying how hard it is idk I'm not a python programmer*) for very little benefit beyond Qol patch.
---
Oh and this should have been a feature from the start but again oversight.
---
and then all of a sudden the buffer thorax cuts through the orca small drone bay in no time and still wins xD
---
I know, I'm being sarcastic but this is actually how you play to win in Eve. 
---
A lot of this game's problems can be summed up by "successful strategies are not fun, and in many cases are profoundly anti-fun."
---
large POSes are also a lot more expensive to maintain than low power raitarus, so at least people have to pay for the safety.
---
I played in times when we had over 60k players active on weekend, waaaay before alfa players so all those players had to be subbed.          
---
Before the blackout we had like 30k (alfa +omega) and after the blackout like &lt;25k.           
---
This is huge drop if you consider the fact that we not only lost players in terms of quitting but also many went from omega to alfa subs.            
---
CCP notified players 3 weeks before implementing the blackout, but removed it before posting the devblogs.            
---
This can (but don't have to ) mean that this change related to stuff happening and affecting the bottom line to hard.
---
meh
---
I'm not entirely sure that would necessarily be a bad thing. I'd like to see more types of fleet formation emerge that aren't "anchor on the FC and F1"
---
Depends how big your alliance is really doesn't it.
---
The gila is a pretty hard counter to the ramjag. So is a dual web Loki. 
---
You’d have to be completely suicidal to fly a ramjag at a fleet including both of those, and you’d get nothing but a lossmail for your trouble.
---
Do you see any Pamfam at that fight??  
---
You also do realise that Imperium is the largest coallition (44k)  
---
Legacy is the 2nd largest (38k)  
---
vs  
---
Winterco (18k) 
---
with the occasional help of pamfam (23k) , but NC is deployed to fight gotg with the help of horde  
---
big wigs Need a new narrative for the reasoning of Imperium "3rd partying" these fights
---
"if they dont feed me hard or dont get pinned down on my home space they dont want a fight"
---
This is true, and a good meme :)
---
Not really. Any fleet that has a "strategic objective" (strategic = boring) and/or has over 60-70 members a waste of everyone's time.
---
If you're in a coalition, you are probably blue to everyone within 2 regions. And red to everyone outside. The only fights you are going to have are must win capital escalation to the hilt, timezone optimized TiDi fest and the occasional reaction fleet to defend crabbers but that's probably handled by the super umbrella.
---
Any other fleet is probably to go bash some undefended structure with millions of ehp to setup a possible off timezone fight.
---
You want small gang stuff? You want regular PvP? Leave your coalition. Join a smaller alliance with few blues or go to lowsec / WH.
---
Tribute and Vale are pretty much all small groups. Scalding Pass has a few as well, and parts of Pure Blind / Fade are smaller group owned now.
---
Some are even decently friendly to newer players. ROTE and Unspoken both have a decent number of new(er) players by most small, "elite" group standards, and Reverberation Project isn't too harsh on sp requirements and whatnot afaik. Idk what CONE does for recruitment tho.
---
The lesson learned by you is a simple one. Dont mine in anything other than a procurer or a skiff in high sec. 
---
Reasons why being ganked are simple. If you in a retriever or coveter then it takes next to nothing isk wise to gank you ans so people do it for fun
---
Yes ofc purely for jump freighters
---
I agree with probably 60% of the list, but it's fairly apparent that there are parts of the game that you don't actually play. Upper-echelon ratting/mining should absolutely be the roles of Supers/Rorqs, otherwise there's an incredibly low ceiling to those activities. If you can't Super rat you top out your ratting income after \~5-6 months of training. If there's no Rorqual mining you top out your mining income after like 3-4 months of training. What's the point of growing your skills in those areas, after that point?
---
Some people want to do PvE. There's no benefit to reducing that ability for them just because you don't like it. To be clear: I don't super rat -- I tried it once and didn't really care for it. I do Rorq mine, and it's already been nerfed to hell (50% of previous effectiveness). Just because Delve mines enough to crash prices on a lot of stuff doesn't mean nobody else should be able to mine effectively. Come up with solutions that encourage players to not "super mine" with 50-60 Rorqs out in a system, instead of just cutting all mining down together. It affects Delve less than anyone else, and the rest of the game suffers.
---
and dinobrains complain about a lack of smallscale content on reddit....

No that’s the leet pee-eve-peeers.

Fucking lulz
---
"It's ok to kill defenseless ships in highsec, but when it happens in nullsec I unsub" - r/eve
---
He literally said "Customer Service Rep" immediately after it.
---
No disrespect to the author, but customer service reps require virtually no skills at all, other than "ability to talk to people".
---
Best number.
---
I think for the first one, if you implement the "roving incursion site" idea, all the systems in a constellation will end up with high ADM from people chasing the site across all the systems.
---
&gt; I also don't like increasing Cruiser Warp Speed to 4, HACs are a counter to BS, I don't think they should warp 33% faster than them (is part of the issue with BS being 2, and C 3 right now). I think Frig should also be knocked down to 4 (intys to 5). BS 3 &gt; BC 3.3 &gt; C 3.5 &gt; Dessie 3.7 &gt; F 4. CCP already established the .7 warp speed so .3 should be doable. More over I feel that just makes your support ships land even fast ahead of a fleet, since align time changes aren't being adjusted in conjunction.
---
This I disagree with. Compared with other forms of mobility, warping and warp deceleration is quite slow and gives the enemy a lot of time to react, especially since warp initiation is instant. Almost everything except caps should come out of warp deceleration faster, which makes disengagement harder and results in more things dying rather than everyone being able to just run when an enemy fleet lands.
---
&gt; I just think having cruisers and frigs at 4 and 5 would be oppressive and return us to the post warp speed changes of Cruisers Online with support Frig Ewar.
---
With battleships buffed and their natural predators (bombers and caps) nerfed. Cruisers online might not be nearly as powerful since a smaller battleship fleet can beat a considerably larger cruiser fleet. Pulse apocs can apply to cruisers extremely well and out-ranges them, except for the Eagle which should probably lose it's double optimal bonus.
---
You'll have to deal with systems swapping factions which pretty much means no market citadels since they're going to be auto unanchored I assume. So neutrals will have to use NPC markets exclusively.
---
Basically any coalition in the history of EVE.
---
You don't deserve claps.
---
Yeah, the goal is find some sort of balance. These types of threads exploded in popularity over the last few months and it drowns everything else out. Hopefully one of these two options will work well enough. If not, we have to figure out a more accurate minimum for these suggestion posts. Traditionally we would just use filters for this but the traffic patterns of r/eve changed significantly over the last year or two. Most people who browse now use mobile apps (we cant tell which ones) and filters don't work on most of those.
---
Great topic, would like to see something similar continue.  Instead of a repeating the megathread, run a weekly topic for a specific part of the game using top rated or commonly posted ideas and let us provide ideas and feedback on those areas.
---
My thoughts on some areas that would add something new; flesh out or change existing mechanics:
---
* Resource redistribution - unevenly distribute resources throughout New Eden
---
   * Materials can't be found in every constellation in significant numbers, rarer resources less commonly found
---
   * Some regions should be known for being rich in certain resources, others might have a little of everything in lower numbers
---
   * Tweak resource field caps and regen rates, slowly change caps/regen rates over time
---
* Add discover-able signatures for resource fields, npc wrecks with loot, etc.
---
   * RNG instanced signatures based on travels within a system (your sensors pick something up, provides a reason to move about a system)
---
   * New sensor modules and skills to increase range sensors pick up the signature and boost RNG of discovery
---
   * Must be scanned down with appropriate probes, warped to, can be bookmarked
---
   * Bookmarks can be sold a-la DED escalations
---
   * Wrecks contain some loot, more can "drop" to cargo hold by running salvagers on wreck
---
* Revise tractor beams to include repulsor function with scripts to either pull, push or possibly hold target at a certain range
---
   * Add the requisite stats to be in the mix as new offensive/defensive modules 
---
   * Split into S/M/L/XL sizes with variation to range, tracking, strength, cap usage, fitting, etc.
---
   * Gist is we can fit and use to push and pull based on ship masses, beam strengths, etc
---
   * Overlaps with webs to some degree and might require their re-balancing or removal
---
* Change Omega skill gain by total SP - throwing out example to demonstrate the idea only:
---
   * 100k+ SP = 1x (current SP gain) ;  75k+ SP = 1.25x;  50k+ SP = 1.5x;  25k+ SP = 2x;  &lt;25k SP = 3x
---
   * Whatever the rate boosts are, let's get newer players up to feeling like they can compete with vets faster than where we are at now.
---
There are so many things CCP could do, they'll never make everyone happy but strong balancing moves that render significant SP investment useless needs to be avoided.  I believe they can tackle a lot of the economy issues by tweaking the resource system.  It doesn't need to be a hard change and they can even throw some lore behind it.  Beauty of this method is they can change the spawns, quantities and regen rates behind the scenes and resource depletion is a completely plausible scenario.  This would provide some content as rare or extremely abundant resource fields will become focus of contesting areas.  Mining Ops would need fleet defense, now you have some PVP for taking/holding the field and during the op.  
---
More important yet to the future of EVE is new content.  Add some exciting stuff that gets old players to return and hopefully, keep them around.  I use the example of above with adding more to the exploration career.  There really isn't all that much variety to exploring so adding content in the form of wrecks to be salvaged, resource fields to be found gives explorers more to do and make money on then relic/data sites.  Same with PVP (PVE too) and the tractors/repulsors.  Now your fits might need to account for the potential of a target dictating range through prop mod and tractor/repulsor beams.  
---
New Eden is such a great universe with loyal and passionate players who have supported the game for a long time.  Adding new mechanics and content will bring excitement and more returning and new players than you'll lose (unless it's done really poorly of course). Always focusing on changing what exists will only keep the salt mine production at record highs.
---
CCP - listen and consider the creative ideas of your employees, your CSMs and your player base.
---
No body said they arent retarded lol
---
All depends on the orca fit.
---
Yep thats also why in other games with no full loot people take risks way more freely. The second you can lose something valuable to you it gets difficult. I mean the best and most fun I had doing PvP was when FW was still alive and we just dunked it out in cheap t1 frigs and dessies for hours with no end. 
---
Sadly the big blocs intervened at some point especially snuffed during that time who just dropped tracking titans on anything that moved. And with gallente getting assistance from the big blocks to fuel the vni market the good corps in caldari site just left.
---
Where am I now? Goonswarm because screw getting dunked on the whole time.
---
and orca gets a pretty small shield buffer aside what it has got already. a DREADFUL active tank, but a nice hulltank, but if it has drone DDA's it doesnt have a hullbuffer.
---
I hope you’re flair baiting because SMA doesn’t have a lot of experience with not getting steamrolled
---
The problem isn't the couple of good feedback / idea threads that shoot to the front page - it's the hundreds of ones that clutter up the new queue and drown out things like AAR's, meta game stuff and so on. We're open to suggestions though.
---
I super rat and I think it's dumb, because it's very much a win more activity that encourages everyone with a super to run to Delve/Esoteria/Malpais so they they can super rat under an umbrella. If you don't have an umbrella super ratting is suicidal so nobody does it, and this greatly inhibits the ability of smaller alliances to build their own super force, since super pilots would rather go to where they can make money with their super. Ditto for Rorquals. Eliminating mass super/mass rorqual PvE hurts Delve/Esoteria/Malpais more than everyone else because those are the only regions where you could safely super/rorqual anyways.
---
&gt; otherwise there's an incredibly low ceiling to those activities. If you can't Super rat you top out your ratting income after ~5-6 months of training.
---
I don't see anything wrong with that, allowing new players to catch up by limiting the effects of the SP gap (but not the skill gap) is a good thing.
---
If everything besides the Pie and the Sky section were implemented, i'd be very, very happy
---
Falcon is just a community manager, what the fuck do you want him to do about it? You know he reads /r/eve, you think he'd miss a thread with 600+ upvotes, two diamonds, five golds, etc.?
---
He'll just forward it to someone and it will be thrown on "the pile of player suggestions" - a small plastic trashcan.
---
I could tell you the same thing actually :)...
---
Remember when NCdot and PL were "elite" and bragged about winning when they were outnumbered?
---
nope
---
This will be deeply unpopular, but I'll throw it out there anyway.
---
1. Clone the server so we have Tranquility (current game rules) and Chaos (new rules below)
---
2. Tranquility stays the full blown PvP server, Chaos becomes the PvE server. Yes it's ironic that they are name swapped for how "carebear" they are.
---
3. Rule changes for Chaos server:
---
   1. No sovereignty, you can still place player structures, but there is no sovereignty to keep people out of systems. Abandoned structures can be "restored" after a given time and transfer to the "restorer". 
---
   2. PvP method 1: via faction warfare sponsored in certain star systems/constellations/regions (high, low and null) as determined by the Eve dev team and their desire to move a narrative forward. Participation yields specific rewards that are only available via this method. Basically the devs play the factions more like corporations and less like static entities.
---
   3. PvP method 2: war decking between corporations and alliances targeting specific systems. This would be the way to remove player structures from areas that once corporation wants that the other is occupying. The "defender" can choose to abandon the system to the "aggressor" and end the wardec. The "agressor" can only have 2 wardecs open at any one time, yet can be a "defender" to any number of wardecs. System to be tweaked to prevent griefing and a reforming of the blue donut.
---
   4. PvP method 3: dueling
---
   5. Resources grow and deplete based on player activity. The more activity, the less resources due to depletion of ore/ice/gas and pirate factions avoiding the area.
---
   6. NPC factions invade high value systems in null and low sec. The more juicy the target and/or the more "aggro" the players draw in a sector, the more likely the NPCs will appear with a fleet to take on the players. Think of it like this, if a corp is blowing up Angel rats constantly, eventually the Angel pirates are going to try to fight back. Same for a big ole undefended mining colony.
---
There's more to this game than kill reports and npc corp activities...
---
I think with defined front lines, you can still have market citadels a few systems behind the front, and have warning to move it once the front gets too close for comfort.
---
I know this isn't the point of any of this, but I would really, really enjoy a lore storyline that involved some kind of cataclysmic event - cosmological or AI or incursion/invastion related - that shattered the HS safety zone and sent the empires fleeting outward
---

Amazing to see Noraus not actually pull out his credit card thinking it will get him somewhere.  Oh Wait!  He already payed Snuffed Out.
---
lol no.

Who isnt?
---
That was back when only they and goons could use supers.
---
are there even 324 chinese eve players living in china
---
My guy, i had no problem fighting waffles and getting owned. They at least called me a pussy.
---
Do you call 60 goons showing up to your doorstep every given night as small scale or small gang?
---
The only content I complain about is when Fraternity decides to take 5-10 guys to Legacy space then run away from 3 assault frigates.  Then we get to read how the redditors complain small gang is dead.
---
Just retcon lol.
---
Say the collapse of the EVE gate created "quantum flux instability" or some other shit that radiated out from the EVE gate like the eye of terror, and this instability prevents FTL travel. As a result, FTL was only possible near the edges of the cluster which is where the space empires were founded. 
---
Over time, the instability receded and better technology allowed FTL closer to the EVE gate, which allowed the empires to slowly move inward into what would be lowsec. However capsuleers have no concept of caution and rushed into newly navigable space to create sov null, and Pirates moved in as well to be farther from Empires and their police.
---
Marry them.
---
&gt;try going to a game
---
[Literally didn’t say that](https://i.imgur.com/IaxCwbV.png). Lmao. I was on comms trolling the dummies who engaged on grid with a wormhole.
---
That response makes no sense. You complain wormholers upship and don't leave the hole, I send you 4 BRs of wormholers using the same exact ships (on different days) and doing nothing but roaming.
---
lmao, great job test, must've been a fun fight for your members, what's the plan after blobbing WC? I dont think there is anyone left you havent blued yet
---
They’ve talked so much shit about PL and how we aren’t committed to our deploys and how TEST is this battle hardened group. Well we’re here to tell them to nut up or shut up. They’re going to be homeless soon.
---
Fuck all this armchair dev shit. Seeing half of the posts on the frontpage full of terrible ideas is not helping
---
Yes there is mining and empire building !

 “They worshipped, so they said, the Great Old Ones who lived ages before there were any men, and who came to the young world out of the sky. Those Old Ones were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first men, who formed a cult which had never died. 
---
This was that cult, and the prisoners said it had always existed and always would exist, hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest Cthulhu, from his dark house in the mighty city of R'lyeh under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway.”

Good observation. There's a bit more to the story. If a bot-aspirant truly craved ISK above all else, he wouldn't be in highsec. He'd seek higher-paying forms of PvE elsewhere. 
---
But the bot-aspirant often prefers precisely the lowest-paying PvE that EVE has to offer. He wants to feel that he is accumulating isk—no matter how little, no matter how slowly. He wants that accumulation to be as risk-free and low-effort as possible. 
---
To what end? What's the ultimate purpose in piling up a bunch of ISK that you can't use? Finally, one blessed day, the highsec miner quits. All of the ISK in his account is either sold or goes down the great ISK sink in the sky when the miner fails to resub. So you see, it's not really greed, but something less than that. Something even more base and pitiable than greed. It's a kind of gray, lifeless materialism. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a word in English that adequately describes it.
---
I think not having a profile pic means you haven't logged in after the portrait changes.
---
No u
---
What group are you in? Sure sometimes can get a bit of a dry spell but ive never experienced anything like you’re describing.
---
Overall it's a pretty cool little smattering of dudes, no big coalitions. A few small skirmishes here and there, peppered with china rolling through with a 20 man fleet here and there. Probably the most prevalent demographics in the area are burner mission runners and &lt;1m t1 frig explorers.  Actually lots of fun though. 
---
These threads are fucking great too, seriously I've been actually checking reddit every time we have a fight to see what kind of zany shit is coming up on reddit next from FE.
---
If you were in c0ven, then we are.
---
Yeah for the first 2 years I played the game I was the token newbie in a group of much older players. It's annoying but I think learning from good people who know what they're doing outways that.
---
Min Max is a thing, even at the coalition level.
---
Ahmen. EVE should not be AFK. However, this should come with more interesting and profitable content
---
Yeah my point is it's gonna be risky for neutrals to shop there so no need to worry about them having access.
---
1. 'Newbie' freighters... yeah ok.
---
2. I don't gank them, in high sec or low sec or at all.
---
3. Deployed hunting test at the moment so you'll have to come out here as well if you want to kill me.
---
Wait.. you mean like use those profits from krabbing to fund your PVP? Your MAD!
---
What doesn’t make sense about it. You cited an example that isn’t blobbing.
---
You mean NC 2019
---
It's also ever big bloc ever 
---
"goddamn cowards stop running away in your cruiser gang, come back and fight my cyno ship with 85 titans on the other side"
---
Catalysts are a currency that gankers use to buy content. The K/D ratio is not a concern. Youre thinking like a smoothbrain nullseccer.  Gankers do not play by those rules.
---
Oh fuck surely test will will the war with this fort gone
---
Well I mean it’s protecting the very expensive crabbing toys that the Cruiser gang was after anyway. You didn’t expect them to come in for a cruiser vs cruiser gang did you?
---
:) no i just simply prefer dcu. 
---
Acu is def better for fleet i think
---
For solo, it depends on the circumstance i guess :)
---
I mean, When you had force multipliers in that game that made fighting outnumbered more possible  
---
yea I do.  
---
NC/PL have always gone the Underdog (in terms of straight up numbers) vs other entity's,  
---
game changes, so does the way people play it.  
---
looking at player sentiment on reddit and nearly every discord, doesn't sound like it's for the better however..  
---
(don't get me wrong there were some broken AF things in the past)
---
Do you not have phones
---
I think many people like oranje :) https://dutchreview.com/wp-content/uploads/kings-day-in-amsterdam-2018.jpg
---
It is because CCP support Trump!
---
&gt; I'm simply saying it's CCPs choice not a limitation.
---
Yes, it's CCPs choice that the developer hours that would go into it have not been a worthwhile investment compared to the many other problems they could be used on. 
---
Taking it as given that actually returning to the character select screen is too much of a technical issue to reasonably overcome, the implementation would have to be for the client/launcher to simply auto-restart back to character select. The amount of time players would gain from this vs closing the client and reopening from the launcher is tiny.
---
I primarily run Blue Tiger and Ghostbird skins, but after the last Blue Tiger dale everything dried up tbh
---
&gt;Experience running live game projects, requiring high frequency feature and content updates.
---
Blackout 2.0 and asset safety removal confirmed also HL3.
---
so tapi should shoot themselfes then...
---
I understand the dislike, I get most people just want to have a good brawl and getting blobbed is not fun when you get wiped out.
---
But some of the best moments I've experienced in this game is being in a small fleet of bombers or assault frigates, and being caught and dropped on. If we manage to get out of the bubbles its then cat and mouse for the next 30-40 minutes while we try to escape and then extract without losing more than we take out.
---
Warp from safe spot to safe spot, jump a gate, warp to another safe. Where are our scouts? We need to get back to the WH we used to get here or we're going to have to fight and die. Blap some stragglers , lose more ships. Get out. 
---
Fun, hectic, sweaty palms.
---
Reminds me of when I was younger and we local kids would throw eggs at cop cars, taxis, or whatever to get a chase.
---
Blackout made this sort of engagement a lot more fun but we'll adapt.
---
Blobs won't go away and I consider it as a hazard just like any other in this game, and to be fair, if I went fucking around in some guys backyard and he jumps out with his crew and beats the shit out of me I wouldn't be complaining about it.
---
Why bring any caps if none of them apply to subcaps? People keep wanting to make caps useless against subs but so good against each other. Why the fuck would anyone drop caps against a structure when it can be easily killed by the structure or a subcap fleet?
---
Well now I just want to hang around with test and whore on all their kills just so reddit can unironically lose it's shit about batphones
---
Yes!
---
Looks like aids bruh
---
It wasn't one module it was an across the board increase in value of ISK relative to things built by players. This includes plex. Ratting became harder than mining due to rorqual still receiving the massive protection on panic. 
---
As less isk enters the game demand for isk increases and those not printing it will give more of their product in exchange. So those who continued to rat experienced around a 30% increase in buying power.
---
Ogre's, think its safe to presume you can't use T2 so faction would be just as good
---
One of the problems we've had in GSF is people creating software we came to depend on, slapping it on a resume, and disappearing into a real career with it.
---
There aren't a lot of other places where it's so easy to find a complex project that will be used by real people.
---
i miss Seagull
---
Stop being retarded
---
Goons
---
That might be a matter of taste, but I can relate more to a "simple guy stepping up, leaving his mortal live for an eternal repeating of the pains of countless deaths to be able to safe his parents humble mining-station somewhere in LS from raging rogue drones and ruthless pirates while trying to pay off that odd criminal guys he lended his frikkin lil destroyer from" than all that over-the-top-megalomaniac "some spoiled royal brat goes out to save gods grandfather with this spoon his nanny fed him with". vOv
---
If you havent, go, watch it!
---
Its almost like since seagull left there is noone at all stearing the ship. 
---
They are trying batshit crazy ideas and putting a dress on it by sayin "chaos" to try and make it sound exiting
---
More like herpes
---
You're not making 500m/hour in a C3.
---
Try the simple questions thread or /r/fittings.
---
On top of the advice in the thread join a corp at some point.  It doesn't have to be a large nullsec entity.  Just join a group that is friendly and doesn't place limits on your activities while you learn the game.  Having folks around that are experienced is really helpful.  If you join a corp and you don't like the vibe just leave and find another one.  The major nullsec entities are great because their infrastructure for teaching newbies is very well developed.  Remember that anyone and everyone is allowed (actual CCP authorized game mechanics) to scam you in this game.  What that means is be cautious of folks and what they're asking you to do.
---
Fair enough! Thanks!
---
Maybe it's just you who aren't making 500m/hr in a C3.
---
You are looking at the wrong space to find pvp. You are looking at null, where the vast majority of players are just crabs that will never do pvp. They prefer to stay docked waiting 24 hours until you before they would fight for it. Maybe they should gave played another genre of game.
---
When you realy want pvp go to lowsec or wh, this is where the actual pvp players are.
---
Oh thank you i didnt know about this subreddit
---
Then just join goons or test and you can have arranged fights.
---
No one's making 500m/hr ratting in a C3 with one account, period.
---
If they open fire in hisec, they will become criminals and open season begins.
---
better resist with DCU. Work fine with heavy self rep like this fit.  
---
ADU is more used as anti alpha for fleet or aditional buffer for short fight (with ancylari armor rep for exemple)
---
it's plenty profitable lol that was the whole problem
---
when reward is too high for the risk, it must be balanced. that's why every single "tHeY dIdNt iMpRoVe tHe rEwArDs" poster is mentally retarded
---
As a provibloc member, I support this sentiment. No such thing as perfect safety down here. It's great.
---
Yeah we all suck, now kiss and get it over with.
---
Have you considered that you may just be bad?
---
tbh you shoulda made that thread the megathread and just stickied a comment on there saying what OP said
---
Leave blob groups. Join the small entities.
---
**MAKE EVE GREAT AGAIN**
---
&gt; Nah we hate each other 
---
Maybe like 5 years ago but now your leader tells you he hates a, b, c and especially d. While the normal member jumps on the train to hate them, the leader is doing 5 deals with a, b, c and d.
---
He's in Brave, he's probably retarded
---
Oregonian here: 
---
For metropolitan areas, Portland isn't even polluted compared to the likes of the rest of the country.
---
I'm not the one who has to pull massively inflated figures out of his ass in an attempt to impress /r/eve
---
Here is the IMDb 
---
https://m.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/
---
I mean, what did you expect? This is EVE. People gank because they get a rise out of ruining someone's day. It's just a variant of the Penny Arcade Greater Dickwad theory. It's why EVE attracted people like Erotica 1. People are here to be cruel and spiteful to other people in an environment where none of it actually matters. CCP themselves encourage this kind of behavior. It's not realistic and it's not gritty, but it's what EVE is.
---
Real question is, how long is it gonna last though.  Human nature says probably not very long.
---
Why would I want to pull massively inflated figures out of my ass? Do you know how much effort it took to get them in there? And how would I get any pleasure from them if they weren't in position?
---
We were small and new to null back then. So we were vary enthusiastic about everything. We only had maybe 8 systems lol. And it didn't last long.
---
OK.
---
There is still a difference between what my leader does and what i do. I also hate that i cant really fight some guys, but sometimes you have to decide what you can tolerate.
---
Obviously. I’m just a random shitposter. But it’s obvious you asked them to come.
---
wrecking ball wasn't about "force multipliers"
---
&gt; doesn't take the fight because they expect you to not have shown your whole hand.
---
You're pretty much right on the other points, but getting proper intel is really not your aggressor's duty
---
Yes - but by then it's usually to late. If you don't use something with extreme DPS or alpha, I don't care if you shoot my catalysts - concord kills them anyway. To save the target, you need to kill them significantly faster than concord would do anyway.
---
Honestly I'd be very happy with Eve (or Spiritual Successor Eve) 2.0, even if it wasn't a CCP project. There are so many design decisions I would reconsider that were just clearly born out of early MMO days, or were adopted funky playstyles.
---
Nah dude, I like your answer. I mean, I don't get it at all, but I like it.
---
Even when fully at the keyboard, nullsec ratting hardly worth the time/risk compared to other active farming options.
---
It isn't common?
---
Literally most of the answers here are "Lel they salty, I like salty."
---
I shouldn't have to explain that a game system that fucking requires you to buy a separate account just to move your shiney ship around the fucking map is completely non nonsensical.
---
&gt;  My question is , is it worth it?
---
If you have to ask this question, then you already know the answer.
---
Uninstall
---
Man, you stayed alive forever with a TON of stuff on grid. Out of curiosity, since you invested in some bling elsewhere in the fit, why not navy ENAMs? They're not too expensive compared to the reppers or MWD, at least when people aren't messing with the market.
---
Strictly speaking they're roleplaying the suicide bombing terrorist though.
---
I will usually keep a brick drake or gnosis in my SMB and ship to that if reds pop up in local.  They have mining drones too. :)
---
I also fly with a cheaply fit, max insured, drone platform to reduce the number of times I have to drop my drones and pull out a combat set.  If the number of reds is more than 15, I will pull up stakes and find something else to do.
---
I also wonder why people are dicks to each other IRL.
---
Griefing on alt accs prolly...
---
nO
---
Imagine being a null alliance that can only manage 78 people in your primetime.
---
All I do know is the skins creators hate the bhaalgorn. And it makes me sad
---
If you want to mine, you buy up the skills + injectors to fit an Orca. Be sure you also have a 2nd monitor for Netflix or Hulu as you wait on your cargo bay to fill up.
---
Using the word escalate when applied to Tuskers is pretty hilarious. They might bring 10 people instead of 5, the horror...
---
(for those lacking the context, Tuskers are a _small_, selective recruitment pvp group who tend to favour small gangs &lt;15 of manually piloted, local repair ships)
---
So basically hunting still is catching people unable to defend themselves or getting hard core dunked ? I mean as long as the MER chill the fuck out why not, but I doubt it will have much effect ...
---
#BRING RATAAH SUNSET BACK

and/or get banned by CCP cuz its 2019 and mean words hurt
---
not high res, but here’s the last pic I took of my [vagabond](https://i.imgur.com/ooOBUsB.png)
---
&gt; Nerfing cloaks become justifiable only with pure blackout conditions as cloaks do become OP under it.
---
Nerfing cloaks would drastically change w-space, since now I have a great chance to simply know when anyone else is in space with me (except for combat recons). Might as well bring local to WHs (bluegh). I am guessing it would also make seeding/offensive scouting for evictions way harder, so those get less frequent, and krabbing gets way safer, even if you make changes to WH spawns to make them more difficult to control. The danger comes from never being sure you're alone.
---
you could always use the gates like every other ship class if its too much hassle for you... cynos are an additional movement option, but not the only one.
---
That's a great take on it. You see this all the time with all the old software and spreadsheets that don't get updated any more.
---
Are you high? A 60 man cruiser gang can destroy a carrier pretty easily especially a non-super carrier. Hold him down, and bash the fighters as they come out. And ratting Myrms don’t stand a chance against even a single cruiser.
---
Thats true, i bling enam from time to time
---
not just this time ) cuz i found myself getting greedy and bling it more and more. 
---
like oh dead space eanm is so cheap its only 50m, hmm why not bling my scram too? its only 50m as well etc etc :) its like shopping
---
Yeah, all of the salt in this thread about how Tuskers was going to blob them is making me very confused tbqh
---
This article kind of speaks the truth about me - I did some work with ESI and Python, both new things to someone who has worked with bare metal embedded systems/MATLab for 5 years prior, and I moved across the planet from Australia to Germany and gained an EU Blue Card  because of the skills I gained and could demonstrate these skills.  
---
It is important to note that yes, EE/PhD has alot of employable skills already but the Python/REST Api was one of the sticking points in alot of interviews.
---
Goons have no interest in holding the space, Legacy has no interest in holding the space and PandaFam held the space but is now consolidating in the Drone Lands.  If PandaFam came back up north I'm sure it'd just signal the Goons to return and glass the place all over again.  Deadco/GotG already has space... there's no one big entity/bloc that has an interest or is a threat to that space right now that I can think of.
---
Very fair. Keep up the good work!
---
more small gang roams rather than big slug fests. being mobile is a lot more fun than being an f1 monkey
---
The problem here is that Space doesn’t quite work like that  - resources are limitless, hence there’s no real need to wage any kind of conflict over them.
---
The bad guy wants this piece of rock? Move to the next one and leave me alone.
---
Test will probably just go the Panfam route and rot from within then flail desperately for content when they realize they drove their targets into each others' arms oh wait
---
It was a change that's been needed for years.  To be able to light a cyno on any ship especially on throwaway ibis or fit one to your cap really stopped people engaging 'because of cyno' 
---
I remember the old joke about NC. Doing it so much that everyone who saw a NC. Ship assumed it was fitted with a cyno.  So people avoided them.
---
Now we know exactly what ship is possible to have a cyno and you can then choose whether to engage or not.  And because recons can cloak it's going to be a bit spicy wondering if ones there or not, and theres that element of losing a 200mill ship.  So gets people to really think a bit more.
---
Tbh I wish they would do this for Ewar too.  I think it's time we had specialised ships to only be able to do specialised things. Rather than any ship can fit ecm  or any ship can fit neuts  etc.. or even that's too hard for people to swallow is that they have negative bonus to using them. So you could still use them but would say get a 50% reduction in effectness
---
Never thought of it this way, I now actually understands it a bit more, but dropping a carrier on a NIAuguror because your pilgrim can't kill it is a bit overkill don't you think?
---
Good kill
---
Looks lit
---
I will

&gt;60 man cruiser gang

Eve 2019 boys and girls
---
30? rookie numbers
---
1) Blocks ban super ratting/rorq mining.
---
2) krabbing indexes thru the floor.
---
3) CCP surrenders.
---
GF.
---
Noobship lighting cyno -&gt; useful but bad, agree            
---
Cyno removed from capitals -&gt; kind of agree. Bumping is still a huge issue. You can do 'all in a proper way' yet you can die due to bugged ingame mechanics.                
---
Cyno only on recons and BO -&gt; disagre, more ships are needed. Much more. Maybe it need to be a subcap and cyno require a lot of PG so only big ships can use it.
---
Agree there. Crabbing in null aside from raising ADM's was just idiotic. You either needed to down step to abyssals/empire for safety or push into Wspace. Null was just a W-space with un-crashable infinate mass holes with half the isk rewards oh yeah.. and cynos
---
obviously someone hasn't ran high-sec incursions.. :P
---
It sounds like he's hunting Delve.  Have other alliances put a hold on super/titan rating?
---
By not being 13 years ahead of new players.
---
idk I liked those drifters for anti bot activity. they just need to insta point so bot's can't react/fix it without player intervention :)
---
&gt;Eve needs a refresh, but not an eve 2. Overall you can call it what you want but eve needs an overhaul to bring back the fun factor for both pve and pvp. But making a new game entails making a new game,
---
But CCP has proved to be really, really bad at making new games. (Through their attempts to make new games.) The only way to save Eve is to remove CCP.
---
Ashy is a "he" ?
---
I don't know or care lol doesn't change my comment.
---
Hey I didn't say it would be worth while. And an auto reboot would be good enough for me. Lol.
---
It's just insulting to hear ccp say we can't do it. When it's a choice.bnotbsomething that is impossible. Yes impractical and an abundant waste of Dev time. But my point stands.
---
How about a jump bridge flex structure?  Way cheaper than a titan 'cause it can't move on it's own, lets "the little guy" respond with subcaps from their staging as quickly as the groups with titans.
---
Needs a negative though so that the big blocs use titans.
---
more sophisticated bots use intel bots at choke points along routes and if anything is reported within X jumps to warp off and pos up. and hold there until about 8-15 minutes has passed with no local activity or no further intel reports.. then rinse and repeat.
---
Honestly this is an under rated comment.
---
You mean warp core stabs? :P
---
I would say maybe half
---
Let's all bring EVE to Charlotte, North Carolina. Old home town.
---
I contributed to seat with little then javascript know how from google sheets. 
---
As a requirements engineer it helped me better understand the pitfalls in it development and the general dev talk. Now i have become a product owner with my own dev team. 
---
Got seat and eve online on my cv
---
I know i just like busting it for it because it makes my asthma a lot worse and i can't get there easily on account of the 2 hour drive from where i am.
---
I feel reminded bout my own credo I took from my short time in the gaming-industry: Make teh guys and ladies making decissions about games PLAY their own fucking game. Not with tons of freebies and developer-boni and admin-commands. Make em play it EXACTLY like players play it. Make em feel what it means to hunt null for hours without finding a target, make em feel what it means having acquired one of that "fabulous mining barges" with that "big-ass strip miners" and being ganked 20 minutes later standing in front of nuthin again. Make em feel what it means being a dedicated PvP-pilot and not having the ISK left for a frikkin T1-dessie after a short streak of bad luck.  
---
From my experience most game-design-decissions are made cause of metrics that the managers actually do not know how to interpret, cause they have no real idea how that numbers interact with each other in the life-game.
---
Nothing retarded about my question. If he hates all the skins why did he chose to buy one?
---
Yer correct. CCP did the mistake of making them go outside. GL getting them back without actual new content :P (no a balance pass on citadels / W-hole graphic update isn't content)
---
You could also join a megacoalition, but roam on your enemies with your corp mates if you are looking for that smaller gang feel. Most large groups also usually have smaller groups that can get you more action.
---
Nah. That was eve 2009. Eve 2019 is 200 man bomber gangs.
---
I always look for the bottom of the thread to see what imperium is trying to hide :P down voted by friendlies lol
---
Now that the blackout is gone, I'm sure that bot development will be back in full swing. Once China finishes their Anchor &amp; Press F1 bots, we might see more interesting and less one-sided fights.
---
The key is to make the fleet itself the fun part, so if you come away without that big fight, you still had fun.  
---
I have been on fleets involving, Karaoke, Quiz's, linking porn in fleet chat, role-play, prizes and giveaways.   
---
At the end of the fleet the FC should genuinely thank people for attending, making people feel valued and part of a community is essential to keep people coming back.
---
They actually aren't.
---
Did you read the replies?
---
The few that even mentioned salt simply put it on a list of every possible reason.
---
Bookmarking the sun never came close to giving you a deep safe, afaik. I heard the abyssal thing got fixed, but never checked.
---
In a word with clones, what is the difference?
---
There is no real death, only sleeve death.
---
Props to u/R4d1o4ct1v3_ for keeping his cool underfire.
---
Rorq mining is still active
---
There is no "gain" for the blobbers. Most of them probably didn't get on the KM. It's only bad for the blobbed and the game.
---
In 1 month all the krabs will have skilled recon alts (GG CCP: extra injector money inflow!).. 300mil for a cyno F.Recon is nothing for those retard krabs that do nothing other than rorq mine or super/titan ratt... which basically represents all of TAPIrium
---
Where were you?
---
Ask us in the Scanning channel :)
---
Legacy and panfam share these policies.
---
Pretty much. Getting blobbed is a content killer over time.
---
The problem is that there is a killboard.
---
But whether or not they have them logged in and ready to go is another story entirely. We’re talking about people who skill into a 10th rorqual instead of 8 rorqs, 1fax, 1 recon alt because “someone will save me”.
---
I see that we are not in the same team ;)
---
Only took you 1 year.....
---
&gt; You can fit anything, from a noobship to a titan, to give it no ability to fight back.
---
No ship can fight back in highsec against targets that are not aggressed. Gankers aren't going to show up as suspect on grid to give you a chance to fight back. As soon as you try and open fire on your gankers before they start ganking you, you are the one who gets concorded. And opening fire after the gank does nothing because their death is already a forgone conclusion.
---
&gt;"Not playing" is not your only resort. Not by a long long way. You absolutely can preempt a gank by making better decisions. Even if you don't have alts or friends.
---
Not playing is your only option though. Once you are aware that a gank is incoming you cannot do anything to stop it except not be there when the gankers arrive. Yes the gankers can do nothing with you tethered up except maybe try and bump someone off and probably fail but now you are no longer doing what you were doing before you aren't playing anymore. ***That's not fighting back that's just avoiding the gank.***
---
&gt;which gimp their ability to fight back and/or survive a gank,
---
These are two entirely separate things. The first one is impossible and the 2nd one was never my contention.
---
He smokes weed, obviously.
---
Empire builder btw
---
Sure, but that does not mean you do the monumentally dumb thing of deciding "i'm going to purchase something no matter what" before even looking.
---
OPs complaint comes from a place that he created. If he doesn't like any of the skins he doesn't have to buy them.
---
&gt;because the enemy either just doesn't form up, they dock up when they find out what's coming
---
Because blob warfare is all about having the bigger blob. If the other blob is bigger, you wont show up. It's really a balance failure on CCPs part, but bad players think they like it.
---
&gt;This is unusual in most games because content is usually waiting for you.
---
There is also some way to balance things so players don't get instantly wiped out.
---
It's not as easy as you think, but I'm sure we'll find that out together in the coming weeks.
---
Your argument doesnt hold. There are only 370 from the 'two mega coalition" in this fight. The fight timezone not being even their prime time. 
---
On the other hand the defender mega coalition couldnt even field 300 pilots on their prime.
---
Its not a matter of number members.
---
This is a big problem in the era of 250m/tick.
---
In my day, which was some sort of Tuesday - in the 1650s - if I am not mistaken, we just called that zerging.  No bloopty or blobbty about it, no sir!
---
&gt;60 man
---
&gt;gang
---
We're just talking about slightly different scenarios here. OP was discussing a gang of like 10 dudes, that's what I'm assuming numbers-wise.
---
&gt; drown out things like AAR's
---
Bro there's like one fight in EVE per week nowadays
---
Perhaps.
---
For me, skills I picked up in Eve got me from a part time, short term contract on minimum wage as an office assistant to PMO, currently doing configuration management, but also working on documentation management and quality control.
---
370 isnt a blob, vs a 18k primetime coalition in their staging.
---
The umbrella. Because fights are predetermined, they dont need to happen.
---
Maybe just not as diverse as it was.  Tbh why make it complicated.  Why didnt CCP just create a specialised cyno ship that was probably cruiser sized and not stick a plaster over the issue and create a random solution. 
---
Yes bumping for me is ridiculous.  You cant create a damage application because undocking would be interesting especially from Jita 4-4.   Just remove that silliness altogether.
---
It feels like a necessary evil. Sure a bunch of nerds care too much about it, but it's really nice to have detailed records of some of the biggest fights in the game's history.
---
Full stop no. PLEX works the way it does because it only can be bought with real world currency. An NPC selling it would uncut so many things it isn't funny.
---
If you actually wanted to combat PLEX inflation a bit you'd simply implement a can only be sold ONCE property to it. Plex type A is what a player purchases from CCP. This can be used any way the play chooses including selling it to another player. Any plex bought or traded from another player is plex type B. Which has all of the same uses except for two features: It flat out cannot be sold to another player ever again and it cannot be removed from the plex vault to a standard inventory. It is to be used for game services such as game time, multi train, or skins only.
---
What does this do? Remove speculation from the market on PLEX and make it non-viable as a secondary currency. When it can only be used for certain things and cannot be used as a way for storing wealth it should stabilize eventually at a moderately lower price range that is more based on actual demand rather than the combined forces of demand, speculation, and being considered a better bank currency.
---
Players in this game are so wrong about most stuff. They say they want the game to be harder then move to deep null with huge capital safety. If you really wanted to be challenged you would move your super ratting operation to provi and actually get good at the game
---
Ewwwwwwww
---
I was talking about the comment in the thread that said the average cruiser gang cannot take on the average PVE ship.. 60 May have been embellished but the average cruiser gang can easily kill the average PVE ship.
---
Cynos should be on battleship hulls only.  Covert cynos on anything with a covert cloak.
---
Bring back BS/BC wars.
---
A lot of good improvements.
---
The truth is like a BBC in your ass...hard and painful.
---
Wait until you find out about burner missions and abyssals
---
Focused damage bombs for stealth bombers, because fuck supercaps.
---
Is this gonna prevent jump freighters from transporting goods into nullsec alliances?
---
No i am fine with cyno recons, but having only T2 ships able to light the cyno is bad
---
Hics badly need to be able to light cynos. Without HIC cynos tackling supers in lowsec becomes a pain.
---
Recons are reimbursed, why would they be scrooge about it?
---
change is still shit, just delete super capitals and give me back my cynos tia
---
legacy, horde, and GOTG also put moratoriums on super ratting.
---
&gt; After what Hollywood did with Wing Commander
---
what did Hollywood do? nothing. The movie was made by Wing Commander creator Chris Roberts, and sure when still brainwashed i believed his "we got too few time for preproduction", but now 8 years later "nah"
---
Who also have a tendency to be more skilled than most people in this game. I'd advise caution in a fight being Tuskers in nano ships vs some random nullsec player in "battleships" (which battleships, we will never know).
---
I'm stopping everyone before we get the "F1 monkeys" people dropping below : It's not because you're less skilled than someone that you're retardedly bad.
---
Jump Freighters can jump to regular cynos and industrial cynos. You’ll see industrial cynos in lowsec more often.
---
Join a high sec moon mining guild, most of them are very newbro friendly.
---
10 guys in nanoships can easily beat a superior force of randomly assembled ships, especially when they're more skilled/used to these kind of fights.
---
&gt;Why no notification for wh spawn, will make rolling for wh people longer when we search for content.
---
I think the idea here should be to make *K162s* delayed or not notified, so you can roll into others and others can roll into you without awareness on the victim's part until people start popping through/you scan it down. I don't think your statics/dynamics should be delayed, if that's what you mean, since obviously that just cuts people off from each other and reduces conflict. That feeling of "Oh no, a fleet just popped up on D-Scan out of nowhere" would be really neat.
---
&gt;Do you think of the use of cloak in wh with you heat things? Just seems aimed to cloaky camper
---
Agreed. I think this would hurt a lot of wh aspects, and potentially even negate the hidden wh spawn mechanic in terms of danger due to lack of information.
---
Never said it was, but it is smart to assume than when you're lacking intel, caution is necessary.
---
It's forced on players. It provides free intel which results in fights not being taken or groups form up just enough players to make sure you instantly die.
---
You land in a distance only between the sun &amp; the furthr planet, 
---
So if in your system you have some empty space, you can land there and have a "safe" out of scan range
---
&gt; I came back from making a cup of tea.
---
Is that what you call the Keurig next to you command center?
---
Battleships should be able to wield dreadnaught sized weapons just like dreads can use HAWs. This would give battleships a disposable anti capital role.
---
Oh I see, only military ships (titans, battle cruisers, etc) have to use these new 300 mil cynos. Thanks
---
citadel spam is a real problem, especially since you can drop unlimited number of them, as opposed to POS which could be mounted only at moons. Game turned into fucking chore, magnitudes bigger of what it was earlier back in the days.
---
I'd be ok with giving the widow neut bonus.  Replace it's now garbage ewar.
---
So someone tried to anchor a fort on 03 which is perma camped by test?
---
Kinda sucks to say but you don't really play stratops for fun
---
&gt;Alliance is killing people in shit fits and not obeying the rules
---
This right here is why I left null blocs and now despise them. Being in a null bloc is like living in a country commanded by a dictator who kills anyone that doesn't scream pbuh and follow every single rule to letter.
---
Who the fuck are you to tell me how to fly, what to train, what to do. If you want to be an idiot and lose something because you're being stupid, you should have the right. 
---
But no. Daddy says you have to do exactly as he says or he kills you. 
---
Fuck null blocs with a mentality like this. They've went from die quietly to we will full on kill you and kick you out the door for so much as looking wrong. This is how you hemmorage members. This is how login numbers start to decline even if you give everyone what they want. If your own alliance is going to start executing you for doing whatever you want then fuck it. Leave.
---
The miner "fights back" by being aware of his surroundings, just as he would in any other space. A fleet of neg-ten gank catalysts spiking into system is not exactly subtle.
---
Maybe that says something about the state of the game if enough people are so constantly frustrated that they feel the need to make these posts rather than the old, more positive stuff like propaganda. Just maybe Eve deserves these posts right now.
---
Damn right.
---
Well of course if you don’t want to fight then undocking an overkill response and go camp the gate is the right thing to do. But then it’s just to easy to blame it on kitey bullshit and cowardice. I’m not talking about taking an unfair fight either not even an equal one. I totally assume that you will have superior numbers anyway. Look again at the example they bring 2 Gilas a phantasm and a Loki and not 4 Lokis because they want to be engageable not because they lack skills or isk to be in Lokis. Against that kind of gang it doesn’t actually costs a lot of effort to undock something that maybe can’t guarantee you a win but is thought out enough to guarantee that you won’t feed stupidly. A kitey gang will still fight against an overwhelming number of ships provided it’s not plain stomping it, it’s precisely designed to take inequal engagements and wait for an opportunity to kill something that is overcommitted. But you’re not passive either, you have reasonable tools especially ewar to force them to commit more and make mistakes. You have to be subtle with it but if you achieve it you can actually have a good fight with them by dancing around without needing to be faster than them or web them far away. And you sure can actually have a serious and interesting fight that way. Roamers are often starved for content and tend to underestimate opponents especially if they look like kitchensink. But in the end if you don’t want to fight then whatever just don’t put it on kiting being so op or roamers being risk averse that’s just wrong you’re the one that is risk averse and you think it’s op because only because you don’t know how to fight it without a fielding a hard counter. Sorry if it feels personal or anything but you find this misconception over and over and it’s really annoying because people get this meta completely wrong.
---
You are so damn lucky. All the ghostbird skins go for 1.5bil or more.

**5.3 SOME PLAYER JUST SHOT ME; IS THAT ALLOWED?**  
---
In EVE Online, any player may attack any other player if they choose to, no matter where they happen to be. This is because EVE Online is essentially a PvP (Player versus Player) game at its core.
---
**7.2 CAN I AVOID PVP COMPLETELY?**  
---
No;  there  are  no  systems  or  locations  in  New  Eden  where  PvP  may  be completely avoided. 
---
[CCP's New Pilot FAQ](http://web.ccpgamescdn.com/communityassets/pdf/EVE-Online-New-Pilot-FAQ.pdf)
---
Agree. I think the closer a PVE fit resembles a PVP fit, the more interesting both sides of gameplay will be.
---
Tapi mentality ye
---
Suggestion 1: Make the bomb launcher take up a launcher hardpoint.
---
Suggestion 2: Increase the cap on alliance contracts a character can make.
---
&gt; 370 isn’t a blob
---
This game is really dead
---
You missed player activity plummeting
---
Why doesn't response fleets consist of subcaps? They might lose some
---
So, the vast majority of null is unused, even in very heavily krabbed regions like Delve. This gives coalitions very little reason to expand (and thus wage war). This is the carrot end of the carrot and stick of sov warfare (the stick being the absolute misery of grinding through cits).
---
Ratting in sov null should be high ISK/hr but easily over-farmable, and ratting in general should encourage more PVP-like fits. To me, this would look like very lucrative rats that are easily killed with low-SP ships, but that each individual system/constellation would have a much lower carrying capacity for overall ISK generation. Meaning you'd have to spread your alliance out to maximise farming potential, but more casual players that only have a few hours a week to play can actually afford to buy stuff with a little bit of krabbing.
---
It would also encourage alliances to purge parasitic players that crush anoms all day without contribution to the alliance via industry, logistics, or PVP, because their presence would have a negative effect on the other members.
---
As far as fits, I'd like to see rats do much less damage overall and do more omni-damage, as well as having more player-like AI, including warping or burning off when dying. So instead of players fitting rat-specific tanks with max damage, they'd have more mobile fits with omni tank and tackle, AKA PVP fit ships, or at least closer to them. I think this would encourage ratters to be more active in and prepared for home defense.
---
Specific ship balance:
---
I think it's better for balance to make the strengths of weak things and weaknesses of strong thing more prominent, so you preserve the uniqueness of weapons/ships and avoid making everything boring and samey.
---
Med ACs need a buff to falloff, or damage, or both. Currently they're just flat out inferior to other weapons.
---
BS in general could use more DPS. Currently they do a bit more damage than HACs in exchange for 90% worse tracking, worse mobility, worse resists, larger sig, less scan res, etc etc. More raw damage would actually be a reason to bring them to the field.
---
The kikimora should have something less obvious but still exploitable like its cap or agility nerfed, while preserving the stuff players like about it (speed and projection)
---
Move a high to a low on the Tempest. Two heavy neuts are cool but it rarely has the fitting for it.
---
Give the 7.5 ROF bonus to the TFI. I guess CCP just forgot?
---
Nerf jaguar fitting.
---
Make ADCs take more capacitor.
---
I'm not super up with capital balance but FAXes are straight up anti-content at small scales, I think it would be better if capital reps had scan res like capital neuts.
---
Un-nerf HMLs please for the love of God, they've been in balance prison for 7 years
---
The localized injector subsystem for the Proteus is the source of 90% of its badness (the remaining 10% is small bandwidth). It's just fucking useless, especially the AB cap reduction. Increase the hull speed to Deimos levels and change the hull bonus to 10%/lvl MWD cap use and sig reduction. Also the hyperspatial sub duplicates functionality of the nullified sub. So that could take some looking-at.
---
The combat interceptors have been left in the dust with frig tiericide/AF buffs/faction frig changes. They need some love in general, maybe a unique role.
---
It's really hard to muster the energy care about this game when it's so clear the developers don't.
---
Also a lowsec gate to Stain.
---
Man i hope you are high
---
Bro you are from the orange state or Dutch?
---
Hang on, the issue is they *want* to but skins, but *don't want* to buy the ones that exist. They want *other* options that they *would* buy.
---
Yeah you do. Wyd l8r bby.
---
Definitely overkill, and one day that person may just lose their carrier because they dropped it on the wrong gang or without support.
---
These days people will need to "donate" a 300-400mil hull just to light a cyno. Take this offering, thank the jabroni and extract... or hang around for a bit and see how cancerous you can be to them.
---
Congrats ashy. Glad things are going well for you.
---
The only advise I will give is to not consider anything your "end goal" or dream job. Keep improving and getting better.
---
Another transferrable eve skill
---
hmmmmmmmmmm
---
That's not fighting back nor is it being proactive. Yes you can avoid being ganked i have no contention with that absolute fact. No ganking is not a bad thing. A friend of mine makes barges so every time you guys kill one his get more valuable so i in fact have a vested interest in seeing them ganked. 
---
But you aren't fighting back against gankers in this way simply removing yourself as a target for them. And you are mislabeling what it means to fight back by framing it as such.
---
What sort of bread?
---
All true, but N+1. How many ramjags can you stop?
---
Yes. They decided to buy something before seeing that there was something that they wanted to buy.
---
No i just like calling out whiners whining for whinings sake.
---
Came here to feel, not to laugh
---
There's also enough groups there now to mount a legitimate resistance together, especially if they can pick up a benefactor.
---
Because some people are pricks and like to shoot for the sake of shooting
---
Command ships should be able to light cynos.
---
Incursion sites give you nice BMs that are far from any celestial.
---
No, they want to buy something (a new look for their ship), but there isn't anything they like. You're missing the meaning for the words.
---
They've got to pay attention to FW. Totally agree with you about it retaining new players. I probably would have quit if I didn't join FW when I was a new player. Being bounced around shitty barely active high sec corps while trying to learn how to play was awful. I joined a FW corp and was in a fleet being taught how to tackle and fight the very same day.
---
Only if you include only T1 BPC
---
The terms Zerg and blob have different meanings...
---
You're not wrong about the security status for surw, but you're only locking that toon out of hisec, it can still be used for LS, Null, Wormholes...etc.  That being said, as someone who's been -10 on my main before, I agree it's definitely inconvenient to have to avoid HS.
---
True a skiff would do the trick, but I don't particularly care for situations where the counter at is... Just don't use it.  I've learned from person experience that a hulk doesn't have the ehp to survive a few catalysts even with remote reps.  
---
This last point could be taken as an argument to need rorquals and... That's probably true, but it does sting when my hulk is in more danger in HS for less reward than in nullsec where I can pop my panic to save my hulk alts when a wild bomber appears.
---
Oh is this ok now? I'm going to make a ton of threads about the Legion needing more skins then is that ok i'll get tons of upvotes and feverish defenders like you coming to my side right?
---
Can you cite where it was ever indicated that this was going to be permanent?
---
I have one suggestion for Citadels:
---
When citadels come out of reinforce, the attackers get 8-12 hours to start bashing the next layer. Once under attack, repair behaves normally: No damage for 15 minutes to repel the attack. Defenders now have to rally rather than setting their reinforce time to a TZ where the attackers will all be sleeping/at work. 
---
Basically, drop the nerfhammer timezone tanking.
---
Thats not really true as POSes were so bad it was nearly impossible to set right correctly. If any, there was one POS in system you could hide in (others werent usually accessable due to reactions, hangars etc). And that one POS was quite often hitted by reds, replaced with catchbubbles and kept luring corps with outdated bookmarks. So its really not as same as POSes.
---
&gt;All attributes set to 26 permanently, remaps removed.
---
&gt;Remaps are a bad game mechanic that punishes new players who need skills from many different attribute types. A bad remap can screw new players for a very long time as remaps have a 1 year cooldown. This change gives 39 base SP/min for all skills, which is 1 more than an optimal remap currently.
---
Oh my god, please this.
---
Always having some lowsec between null and high would be interesting to say the least.
---
What parts of the game sound frustrating or incomprehensible to you? Have you downloaded it and tried the tutorial mission?
---
It's 1 thread, not "a ton of threads", asking for more variety in general, not for 1 ship.
---
And I'm not defending OP, I'm just arguing tone being a pedant who isn't contributing anything useful to a valid complaint about the variety of skins available.
---
Pumping iron and smooching your girlfriend hbu?
---
People bring what they have onhand for response fleets, which is caps. Caps just do everything better so why bring subs?
---
The other aspects is that against an organized gank fleet, response fleets are usually outnumbered since you have a short time to pull people together vs a gank fleet that has had more time for the FC to organize a comp. So you come in bigger ships to offset enemy preparation and numbers. There's no one size fits all subcap defense fleet that can counter every type of gank fleet. Capitals can't kill every enemy gank comp but they won't die againt them.
---
GOTG are super ratting as i type this, i've been watching them warp/jump in and out of J1AU for the past hour
---
If he was complaining about the skin variety he should have just said "there should be more skins." That's not what he said he said "i want to buy a skin but i don't like the skins that are available."
---
New coke was released in 1985.  
---
On the topic of agile, I've usually found that its strength is being able to deal with users that claim they want one thing and actually need another.  With a more traditional development approach, they are brought in at the end of the project in time to declare it a failure.  In a working agile environment, they are involved throughout the process and the product team can respond as the discrepancy between their claims and actual needs becomes clear.  
---
Obviously this isn't true of most "agile" workplaces, but most of them don't put the effort in to use the methodology.
---
&gt; you’re the one that is risk averse 
---
You really need to stop that, mate. Attacking people in that manner is rarely a good way to get your point across.
---
Once again, you are claiming that what we *should do* is play their game, on their terms. Which I wholeheartedly disagree with. That is their strong point, not ours, so there's no reason for us to do that. It's just bad strategy to play the game like the enemy wants you to play it.
---
The problem is that EVE doesn't have a formation mechanic. So anchoring is the best we got. Having long range smart bombs would be the literal death of subcaps as the first BS fleet to land on grid would win. 
---
Everything else would get deleted by the fleet.
---
Every system I lived in had a pos on almost every moon, and there was always a save large dickstar (max ehp) online and fueled. There was a corp bookmark for each safe tower.
---
To counter what you’re saying, areas like Provi used to have a station in every system.
---
Well aren't you a bucket of joy.
---
Yeah, those people are definitely more fun to kill
---
I've thought t1 cruisers for the following reasons:
---
* It's still a limited pool (5 per empire + 1 for trig)
---
* Easy to train
---
* Easy to build / can't be manipulated as easy as T2
---
* Can have a pretty tanky ship (maller) but nothing special like nullification or interdiction
---
* But not absurdly tanky like you could get on say a Domi
---
Possibly leave the ability to fit a cyno on the recon as the "special" ship but people will use it les.
---
Think of the little guy, right?
---
Rich from a nullblob member.
---
So is reading your drivel, the last freighter killmail I was on was back in 2018 that we killed at a moon mining op. And in total I've only ever been on 3 freighters and 1 jump freighter. But please, carry on with talking out your arse about knowing everything to do with eve after playing for a month.
---
I park tackle on a bridging titan and get bridged to beacons routinely.
---
Jesus actually is flair baiting though, he's in NSH
---
Yeah, no.  I'll happily blob for a strategic objective but for anything else, I'm a lot more interested in putting a comp on grid the enemy deems engageable.  I will 100% get more kills by presenting something they can contest than I will by overforming them and chasing them all over creation, and it'll take a quarter of the time to boot.
---
Blackout was too extreme. Local is too much.
---
Make people show up in local once they talk in local, target lock someone, or are target locked by someone.
---
And please, for the love of god, get rid of skill training attributes already.
---
&gt; but please i want to spend some money to customize my ships with some other colors.
---
From the OP
---
it's almost like if you want to take advantage of all the infrastructure big groups provide you with, you have to do something in return - like don't do dumb shit when told not to do dumb shit.
---
Your argument is founded on a sort of e.honor, the theory that fights should be evenly matched or the outcome doesn't count. 
---
Krabs are specifically looking to maximize their ISK/hr and avoid combat, and they fit accordingly.  
---
PvP'ers don't care at all about ISK/hr and are looking to kill weaker targets, and they fit accordingly.
---
PvP'ers hunt krabs. Krabs evade PvP'ers. There is no honor to be found. It's like jackals and gazelles on the savannah. It's not as though one could slap a miner with a glove and challenge him to a formal duel and expect him to undock in an appropriate combat ship. He'd just cower in his station until you went away. So you strike when the opportunity arises.
---
It also means you could potentially cloaky camp an entire constellation with one character. Need to fix cloaky camping at the same time then.
---
Surprisingly, I agree with a lot of these changes. Some of them I take exception to though. For example: 
---
&gt; Havens/Sanctums replaced with a single incursion style site per constellation balanced around a fleet of 10-12 players in Battleships. Upon site completion, participants are notified of which system in the constellation where the next site spawns. Factoring in travel time and LP reward, isk/hour should be in the 150 range in Tech 2 fit T1 Bs. Average system truesec applies a scaling modifier on payout. 
---
I disagree with this bit not because it is a particularly bad idea, but because I think EVE has gotten--like it or not--more casual as the age of the player base goes up. Just like I told u/Olmeca_Gold , if people only have an hour or so that they can dedicate to the game when they long in because of other commitments--these days for me it is my children for me--if you change a game mechanic such that things are *more involved* and take *longer to do*, even if you increase the rewards, there are still a lot of people in my demographic who just won't. They will stop logging in, stop doing things in space, stop talking to their friends, etc. All of these things are bad. 
---
&gt;Redo the map such that nullsec is in the middle, surrounded by a ring of lowsec, with highsec on the outer rim. The very middle of the cluster is now an SOE NPC regions surrounding the EVE gate. This makes the pinnacle null regions close enough for inhabitants to fight each other but far away enough that holding on to more than 1 is very hard. [Rough sketch of the thunderdome section](https://i.imgur.com/MM25epm.png) 
---
This might just be my hangup, but from the perspective of common sense, and what we know about how human society develops, it just does not really work to have the 'lawless kind of unknown space' in the center of a big circle. I mean, *from a gameplay only* perspective I think you might be right, but I really value the type of science fiction that has an environment that requires me to suspend my disbelief the least.  
---
&gt; **Wormholes** 
---
You do not seem to include anything regarding the wormholes themselves. I think making wormholes things that you can just 're-roll' until you get the answer you like was a mistake. I would like to see this changed by leaving mass limits on the size of ships that can take wormholes, while making the wormhole duration random. 
---
&gt;**Capitals**
---
Here is how I would change capitals:
---
1. Delete faxes; 
---
2. Split non-supers into two categories;
---
   1. Combat carrier--essentially the carrier we see today;
---
   2. Support carriers, which;
---
      1. Can fit and use a triage module;
---
      2. Are the **only** carrier capable of fielding support fighters and can **only** field support fighters. That way you encourage people to either tackle with subcaps, **or** force supers and combat carriers to be in a fleet with a support carrier to do any tackling.
---
Dont forget “all of eve” wants to kill them.
---
Well, I believe you talk about nullsec, in lowsec I have not happened upon that issue
---
OFC, but the "mainfleet" that comes in is still mainly supers, since they can go siren+dromi+3 light fighters and tackle as well as interceptors with the NSA on.
---
People are using super carriers as primary cyno in the big fights.
---
would also make them awesome for undefended structure bashes &gt;:)
---
Man dont get me started on tackle fighters being as good as interceptor pilots.
---
You can play in whatever way you want but if you actually don’t want a fight just admit it that way and stop complaining about the speed of your opponents. If now you’re actually arguing that you can’t fight kitey gangs without “a couple rapiers or lokis” then you’re just wrong.
---
wormhole guys have fights because they can commit to it
---
null can't commit to anything because if the other side escalates to supers and you can't, or worse do and lose anyway, you have to deal with 2 weeks of alliance meetings, a SoundCloud sota, and a month of misleading numbers and arbitrary data on reddit morale posts
---
fuck null it should be deleted
---
Im whining for what? Is a suggestion for CCP, they are doing orribile skins while they can do lot of money. You have to think bigger, no retarded
---
I agree, kind of. There do seem to be a lot of red, orange, yellow, lava, rust, etc. skins. I too would like to see more variety.
---
Would be cool so long as hics get a nerf to the buffer they can fit to bring them in line with an average recon.
---
However I think it's too overpowered and way too lazy to have a ship with infinite scram and a cyno. Cynos are nice and nerfed the way they are.
---
Most of them arent combat fit either. They compromise a lot to fill their primary mining and hauling roles.
---
For all this talk about how changes to the game are killing it, the null sec mentality, in its current state, is just as big of an offender if not more so. 
---
Change my mind.
---
&gt; It was never wardecs that caused newbies to quit. It was "leaders" who told dozens of players to dock up because a one man corp wardecced them
---
PIRAT and Marmite wardecced everything they could, it wasn't "a one man corp", and even if it was, it would be one man with four alts and neutral logi looking for newbs to gank.
---
Please delete your mains
---
how about you, like, i dunno... start your own alliance then?
---
Not a null player, but go roaming in null on occasion. If someone's living there, fights can be had. You are not, by chance, roaming in large blobs, are you? Then you won't find a fight unless you happen to encounter another evenly matched large blob that is also looking for someone to engage.  
---
I agree Citadels are a huge problem with removing response incentives, but even with them, simply making yourself *engageable* can net you engagements. When I pop out in null with 6 or 10 friends, we typically find people and even skirmishes. Unfortunately, there are sometimes apparently huge numbers of bored people all waiting to blob something, and if they show up like that we'll simply move on. Same would be true with 25 or 30 friends. Bring something people *want* to fight.
---
I'm sure it was Altered Carbon. https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2261227/
---
GOTG had a moratorium, but they lifted it after 1 week since upper dek isn't in range of dreads from anywhere. They aren't using space in jump range of Venal or Fade.
---
You can hit almost all of Delve from 319 or PR-8, which is probably why Goons moratorium is still in place.
---
&gt; I will never agree that risk should be higher aspects of random (for this game atleast)
---
Sorry I don't understand what you mean by that.
---
&gt; I dont fly with small gangs to kill big stuff. And I understand that it would be insanely broken if that would be commonplace.
---
Even without local a small gang can't kill big stuff. Big stuff has big tank which you can't break with 10 guys in cruisers (unless it's shitfit, but shitfit ships deserve to die). But it should be possible for a small gang to catch and kill small stuff.
---
I don't agree with that. FW plexes are by their very nature PVP magnets, and while dscanning the gate can give you a high level of safety, if you warp out every time someone comes to try to kill you, you won't be making 100m/hr doing it.
---
FW missions can be memed at high tier for ridiculous levels of ISK and yes, CCP should look at that too. But the primary mechanics of FW (plexing and PVPing enemy militia) can be safe or high value, but not both simultaneously.
---
turkey
---
Orca can warp off in 10 seconds, you can fit exhumers to do the same. It's damn useful in null.
---
&gt; Who the fuck wants to fight risk averse babies?
---
Now you know why catch is dead these days :D
---
&gt; So people avoided them.
---
A goon once told me that cynos bring fights!
---
Reduce stealth bomber torp range by 50%
---
https://zkillboard.com/ship/28606/losses/
---
i dont see them restricted to HS....
---
Of course there is consequences of loosing a system, you'll have to move your assets to elsewhere or leave the militia. Who is typing this, defends nisuwa with absolute motivation.
---
My opinion of most of the porpoused changes are just to empower the playstyles related to the territorial war. But FW is more, is an excuse to PVP, generate income for pvp, plexes are arenas that everybody uses, militians neutrals...
---
Not all the ideas covers every aspect of what FW is for LowSec IMO, per example I saw ideas to basically will prevent having citadels in the warzones to non erolled groups. Or things like forbidding neutrals entering in the plexes...
---
But I agree it needs some love, we need more more pew pew and more pew pew :).
---
I hope CCP makes  progressive and smart changes, just to do not break the actual beauty of the warzones.
---
And CCP do not lower the payouts as you did with the DED complex which payout is shit from the past winter.
---
No. The mechanic is so broken it must be severely restricted. Covert cynos need a 5 min delay.
---
Should've said viable but I see your point
---
it's almost as if the mentality has been created as a product of the environment people are exposed to.
---
#FreeHuslan
---
Really? I didn't realize it was able to do that
---
That might work for the capsuleer, but not necessary for every "avarage Joe" who tries prying some Trit out of the only stone within reach of the only lil roid-station he could effort...
---
If the ship is disposable, cynos will be everywhere again. Do you understand why they made the change?
---
Because the purpose was to cut down on the number of cynos.
---
&gt;  Caps just do everything better so why bring subs?
---
Which is exactly why capitals need big nerfs for interfering with subcap combat.
---
It's pretty useful the way it is. Lots of people in my alliance were using an orca along side hulls or covetors during the blackout and still making a killing. I don't think it needs any changes, the rorq should be mainly for its compression and huge holds. Orca is not that ship
---
tldr for those of us stuck at work?
---
There's a big difference between 'if you don't follow doctrine we won't save you' and 'if you don't follow doctrine we'll actively kill you'.
---
Why not just remove the ship then? Hic's can't be repped while they have point up and a massive sig penalty. Supers can near alpha hics with 3 heavies 2 lights out after they wipe out the cap and hardeners with a cycle from capital neuts.
---
Supers are safe enough as is in lowsec as is, they don't need the only ships that can hold them down nerfed to oblivion because you can't kill a ratting carrier.
---
yeah where is the honor. 
---
they could just a 70 vs 70 at the sun
---
You're projecting a lot of things onto me that I never said, mate. I wasn't "complaining" about them using Nike comps. In fact I've said repeatedly in this thread that I don't blame them for using those comps.
---
I was simply explaining *why* these Nike comps rarely yield anything good when brought to null.
---
Why not just make supers invulnerable in lowsec then.
---
Read up on the prop mod trick
---
I just believe the guys making decissions what goes onto servers and what "doesnt look good" just have ZERO taste.  
---
Just look at the available clothes and hairstyles. Jesus, most of it look slike shit and the few parts that dont just do not have parts that fit to it to make a good dress. Most toons look like they randomly drew their stuff out of some bin behind the second-hand-clothes-store.
---
yeah - the difference is who's killboard it ends up on.
---
This is actually a guest piece from one of her corp mates, ashy is working in the automotive industry nowadays
---
Shitalk mondays, friendship fridays, whinging wednesdays
---
No disagreement there, but then response fleets need something to help them because they need to fight outnumbered against a variety of enemy fleet comps on short notice.
---
There has been incidents where actual FCs got shat on for doing that cause it "ruined secret diplomatic ties" or "drew unwanted attention from group XY".  
---
FFS, we needa get rid of organization-levels higher than corporation.
---
haha goons dont get this meme
---
WTB content. Call me. 10v10 T1 battleships only. Fight to the death. No podding.
---
I typed up this huge post about how i make all my cash, then thought to myself, fuck that, why tell the world how easy it is to make isk in eve.
---
trigs in lowsec, they're still expanding 4-4
---
Flair baited
---
Thank you
---
Thanks I'll do that!
---
It will never be interesting if ratting is a solo activity. Its too easy to just gank them with a small fleet. Then they are just as helpless as they were with a min/max ratting fit
---
If you want to see good content from attacking nullsec ratting, there needs to be some form of gating/grouping system that encourages both sides to fight on equal terms. Otherwise it will always trend to blueballs/helldunk
---
So four viable ships? And if you end up having to fight a "counter", you just die. Lots of fun! Good balance.
---
Huh I think your right, I might have done a mental flip.
---
I did find this on polygon to support you too, https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.polygon.com/platform/amp/2018/8/7/17660410/the-expanse-tabletop-rpg-kickstarter-green-ronin
---
Seems they planned to make the tabletop game pre EVE online.
---
Russians aren't the only ones botting.
---
Maybe i'd had to much pickle.
---
Honestly instead of limiting cynos by ship type, can we have it so it just adds a huge amount of mass and reduces warp speed in half. Would have dual use for wormhole rolling too
---
Eve is a complex game, for sure the code base is not a simple one.
---
\&gt;better player
---
ye ok
---
translation for normals?
---
Another great fight :) luv ya \o/

Greetings Tenacious Testers!
---
The EVE Dev team have been working on another package of tweaks, fixes and improvements for the October release, which have reached the our public [test server Singularity ](https://community.eveonline.com/support/test-servers/singularity/)in today’s update.
---
As with the last package, these changes are primarily focused on improving the experience for pilots in their first few hours and days in New Eden, but of course many of these will be generally useful for pilots of all ages and experience levels. At this time this list is incomplete, and more changes may be added over the coming weeks or make it into the final patch notes.
---
If nothing significant turns up during the testing period these changes will be released in the October patch. As always, if you wish to help, head on over to Singularity and get involved!
---
**Changes**
---
General:
---
* Un-packaged (and undamaged) items can now be sold without any need to repackage them first. Doing so will automatically repackage the item. In the case of non-empty ships or containers you will receive a confirmation message.
---
* To prevent item exchange scams relying on changing the trade’s manifest at the last second, trading now has a confirmation window listing the trade’s item and isk contents. NOTE: The current UI is placeholder, and the ability to set confirmations to auto-accept has not yet been added.
---
User Interface:
---
* Added a suppressible warning when in a station and attempting to buy an item located in another station
---
* Help Pointer links can now be pasted into chat
---
* Added a filter box to the Shortcuts tab of the settings menu to allow you to more easily find a specific shortcut
---
* Added a default “Launch Drones” shortcut (Shift + F) for anyone that had not yet set a shortcut
---
Tutorial:
---
* Updates have been made to the rewards in the Tutorial and how those rewards are claimed
---
* Adding active states and animations to the Mission and Tutorial info panel buttons
---
**Known Issues:**
---
* TBC
---
Thanks and happy testing!
---
CCP Lebowski for the EVE Dev Team
---
&gt; They will stop logging in, stop doing things in space, stop talking to their friends, etc. All of these things are bad.
---
The replacement activity I proposed requires interacting with friends. The idea is that you hang out in staging, grab 10-12 people who want to run sites together and get a titan bridge to your constellation. The manpower requirements are not that tight so if you run out of time, you can drop out and they run 9-11 man until they find a replacement for you. It's almost like WOW dungeons but 10 man and you can drop-in drop-out between bosses if you run out of time. If you have a carrier you can stick your battleship in the SMA, jump the carrier to constellation, and jump back to staging when done/have to leave.
---
Numbers always win :)
---
Flair baiting?! On /r/eve? Outrageous!
---
Yeah because someone who srated in 2011 didn;t have 8 year old players to deal with and everyone was so nice and cudly to new players on top of a decent npe... oh wait
---
I’m not talking about honor and I don’t really care about yours. If you truly believe fleet of 370 peoples are healthy for the game you are part of the problem. 
---
People love to bitch about serenity but we are doing the same thing at full speed.
---
I'll be damned. I had no idea that NC. knew the meaning of the word 'fight'.
---
Why do you want that?
---
Oh man what a conicidence that TAPI/Goons allways on the same side.
---
Ah ok. Haven't talked to ashy in a while. Still pass on my congrats
---
So the 18k coalition fields less then the blob of 82k character? Im shocked.
---
And you decided to give it all up to re-achieve honorary virginity.
---
Interesting play.
---
Just pretending xdxdxd
---
x if gay
---
18k coaliton vs 83k donut. Who could field more? hmmmmmmmmmmm
---
x
---
The cache that drops from the NPC Sotiyos is being changed from 20k m3 to 400k m3 so now you'll need a freighter to loot it
---
That's what your change does. A 5 minute delay between tackling a super and when you can bring ships to kill it.
---
Thanks!
---
try removing the / from the end of shared cache, seems to be an extra / between shared cache and wine
---
can someone else who wines verify that shows like that always?
---
You mean blueing everyone?
---
I feel shortchanged that you talked about wolfpacks but didn't discuss the state of subcaps that can be caught.
---
Unwilling to learn how to loot efficiently, nullbears have whined constantly until CCP are now changing faction capital caches to only be lootable by a freighter, destroying ninja looting and ninja running as a profession. Will Cable Uta do what the nullbears were unable to and adapt? Will nullbears be able to loot without feeding freighters and titan caches? Time will tell!
---
They're not, and try the "Simple Questions" thread or /r/fittings.
---
coalitions are not there for the members to have fun...is to protect high tier ranked scrubs renting empires and rmt sites...start fuckin learning the eve politics....is couple scrubs dictating the direction.Want to have fun?Join a active wh group or npc based corp harrasing megacoalitions...otherwise u just a f1 monkey,most of the time u dont get even the oprtunity to press f1
---
No, whoever told you that was being sarcastic, or you misheard/misread. 
---
Battlecruisers are ok for c1/c2 wormhole combat sites, they may have been talking about doing that, although its not really exploration. 
---
Exploration is generally scanning down data and relic sites and hacking the cans, for this you use scanning bonused frigates or cruisers, the exact fit/ship depends on if you're alpha or omega, but start with the heron either way just for something cheap
---
Orange is the best color, thus your argument is invalid.
---
What does that have to do with the cyno changes?
---
My experience as a Goon member is that strat ops are less likely to provoke a fight then regular evening roams. Possible due to who am flying with.
---
As for the daily random fleet 's though there is almost always action.
---
Are Wormhole sites worth more than relic sites and hacking?
---
considering that as a collective, a chat room is the most basic thing on the internet, meaning we've been doing it since the mid 80s, the fact that problems like this even occur is beyond mind boggling.
---
Meta less than a week old and we have 10000 words from this fucking monkey about how he's figured the meta out and whats going to happen.
---
Bitch please.
---
bluewagons doesnt allow to pvp, BECAUSE NO TARGERS H@H@H@H@H@
---
Right... so ONE ship doesn't do that then?
---
RIP trade window scams.
---
ccp with all measures taken in last 2-3 years nerfed a lot of content...i hope they nerf structures to the grind(like no tethering for low power ones,shorter timers,no tethering while u got the 10 min agro player or 4 min npc timer).And this vision regarding farmville playstyle belonged to CCPseagul  wich departed meantime.I dont have fun to log in anymore in this game.I f players want farmville 100%risk free let  them be(e)...without my real money
---
Caps are nerfed to a steaming shitpile atm
---
It's almost as if this is the only format you can talk in....
---
Yes environment does influence mentality, but environment does not make leaders kill their own members for not obeying rules. It will change the meta, like using caps for everything, turtling up and so on, but killing your own members for not fitting a ship how you want them to is just being a dick. It's control freak level. 
---
If you like being part of an alliance that kills its own members for not spending isk or real life subbing a recon alt or fitting a ship poorly, then good for you. A game is supposed to be fun though and a leader killing their own members for not playing the game how they want them to is ridiculous. It's the behaviour of dictator. We've got enough of those in the real world, games don't need them too. 
---
Fuck null bloc leaders that do this. 
---
Im waiting for goonswarm to start losing members because of their own fleets killing then. It may not be that many and it may be be the dumb few and people from goons will comment "don't need them anyways" but it's the same deflection as those who said the login numbers were down and those were just bots. 
---
The mentality and culture of kill blocs is toxic to this game. Do this, do that, don't do this, don't do that, play the game this way. Newbros who are subjected to this game style miss everything else that's out there.
---
&gt; Added a default “Launch Drones” shortcut (Shift + F) for anyone that had not yet set a shortcut
---
Speaking of drone shortcuts, I noticed that the recall drones shortcuts also work to recall all fighters, but the launch drones shortcut does not work to launch fighters.  It would be nice if we could also launch fighters with the same keybind as launching drones. Drones/Fighters are effectively the same thing, and having to have seperate keybinds for both is kinda annoying since the eve client will not let you bind the same key to multiple functions.
---
Imagine being this far removed from the average  krab
---
Show me your eve warface!
---
&gt; but environment does not make leaders kill their own members for not obeying rules.
---
if you don't enforce a rule - it's not a rule.
---
Good riddance.  Scamming is fine, but if it depends on a UI being shitty, it shouldn't be missed.
---
One thing i always see get brought up with Asset safety is the comparrison to POS. Citadels were meant to replace BOTH POS and Outposts, allowing for the rapid easy deployment everywhere of a POS, with the docking ability of of outposts.
---
Permadeath of assets in a dockable structure is a NEW mechanic. Simply removing all forms of asset safety (even on low-power structures) would have huge ramifications on how wars are fought, where people stage out of, and devalue the whole purpose of owning space/structures.
---
Im really not sure what the best way forward is, but its not as simple implementing permadeath while docked.
---
Why, load up on more tackle, its as simple as that.
---
This to me is the typical "elite PVP" mindset. You want to be able to roll with your "handle everything" ship instead of risking getting pulled into a fight where you are at a disadvantage, just what you want the hunted to be.
---
Add drone auto-aggression to a module, so people have to be down on something else.
---
and encouraged by ccp;get in rorquals /supers,make dunk isk)fc what do now?quit game is to boring
---
Because it doesn't outright state it's mockery, that's what makes it great satire.  You know Robocop is also satiricial right and is made by the same director?
---
It's a love story in which the protagonist and his high-school sweetheart start out as idealistic kids and get chewed up by the system and end up becoming advocates for their fascist war-mongering authoritarian government...
---
Right from the start rico's quite naive but at least he has the brainpower to acknowledge his own ignorance,  when asked by his teacher of his opinion.
---
By the end of the film hes saying things like:    
---
"YOU APES WANNA LIVE FOREVER??!?!!!"
---
Personally, i don't think this is glorifying facism, when you combine that with the juxtaposition of the outright comedic elements  (do you want to know more?)    -- it's pretty obviously / hilariously great satire.
---
End of an era, though.
---
...to stain.I s my corp mate
---
I’m part of the group that steamrolled you guys out of querious l o l
---
YES
---
Y'all got any changes for strontium based timers?
---
Problem with blackout is that you have no counterplay from local residents vs cloaked 10-100  loki/bombers whaetever ships
---
Idk what a "bloomer millennial" is, but, yeah, the mean Eve player is in his thirties.  So, yeah: we're pretty heavily millennials.
---
LOL is right :)
---
Seems a little OP, what if its just half the loot but all the structures go to hull timer
---
Please for the love of god at least call them the way it should be “kitey bullshit” or “nanofaggotry”. I don’t know where you take this “Nike” thing from but it feels offensive. 
---
The thing is that you can make them different flavours with focus on mobility, control, dps or tank but kitey comps are the only large engagement profile comps you can reasonably bring in null sec. You can use brawly small gang comps, especially triglavian ones for specific tasks but there is no real other option for roaming.
---
I don't have all the answers, I'm not a Dev. But the (beyond extreme) difficulty for any major changes to occur in null since we've had the same groups printing isk under umbrellas for years now is the main thing stagnating the game.     
---
That isn't their fault, CCP messed up sov/caps/structures badly over the years. Right now if you don't have a cap/supercap fleet there's no point to even try to take on a bloc for a real war. And no one that's not one of the other Blocs has had the resources to create one = no one new can break into null. And not everyone wants to just jump into a Bloc to live in null, they want to break in themselves. Which is for all intents and purposes impossible with current system.      
---
The changes in this suggestion post would change that up a lot. And the Blocs must also be bored with the current system considering this came from goonswarm and several people from the other alliances have chimed in supporting it.
---
Why did you decide to remove trade window scams? CCP's previously backed away from banning them entirely, what made you change your mind and take these out of the game?
---
Doing pve sites in wormholes is just different, its more reliable, less annoying, maybe a bit more risky, and probably a little less isk/hr. 
---
The problem with finding relic/data sites is you have to scan all the sigs down to see if there even is a pirate relic site there, and if there is one, you have to hope it wasn't cherrypicked, hope it is from a faction with good loot (angel cartel loot is pretty terrible, while sansha is the best, and others are in between), and hope you get lucky and actually get the good stuff.
---
Over a hour or two it usually balances out and you'll make quite a bit, but I still recommend doing exploration in nullsec if you are omega, the only reason to explore in wormholes is that there aren't as many gatecamps, and dodging gatecamps is only a problem if you're alpha.
---
Both doing explo and running sites give you loot that you need to sell to turn into money, so if you get ganked halfway through you end up losing all of that, so each time you get a decent amount of isk return to hisec and drop everything off.
---
Or, you know, just warp the damn thing like in the old days. Not personal or directed on this post, but a very few here thinks that cyno is something magical that will make the carrier do things it cannot do it without. It takes longer yeah but muh asklepians.
---
TBF most of the UI concerns are overblown (it responds fine, you don't see the isk change if you accept .1 seconds after it lands). You just have to not use the trade window to sell your erebus.
---
Hey Bill. It's Mike anthunt. Used to fly with you in amok.  
---
Your condescending tone is a big putoff and one of the many things that made me realize how much I hate null blocs. It's prevelant in a lot of null bloc members, especially among the "elite" corps in goons and is part of the toxicity that I mention. 
---
You may know how to make a lot of isk, gets lot of kills, and you certainly know the mechanics of the game, but your kind of attitude kills the joy I had in flying with the corp. Just because your way may be the best way to do something, it doesn't mean I want to do it that way. I wanted to have fun and damn the killboard. I didn't care if it was inefficient. 
---
I hope you accomplish everything you want to in Eve. Thanks for showing me why I didn't belong in a null bloc.
---
I'm right there with you man.
---
Found CCP_Quant's reddit alt.
---
Kind words and I can personally thank Eve for my own job, too, but this is a guest post by a corp member. Always nice to hear from you though &lt;3
---
Correct. The reason you propose it is beacuse you want cynos to be cheaper so you can use them more often. This is what we don't want.
---
Instead of killing them, let them die quietly or even let them scream while dieing until someone mutes them. That still enforces the rule of we don't save you unless you follow the fit or guides or whatever. 
---
That's the difference.
---
If the UI isn't acceptable to reliably trade what you intend to trade, it's a bad UI.
---
Fact is, if any pubbie wants to trade with you instead of contracting, it's nearly 100% a scam.  That's not indicative of a good UI.
---
Except people just ignore these threads and any comments therein unless they're posted within a few hours of creation.
---
Stickied posts are always a terrible venue for discussion
---
You want the the umbrella. It's what makes caps invuln.
---
No you're completely wrong in that assumption where the hell did you make that up from and no it's what YOU dont want. Dont  think you talk for everyone and especially not me.
---
in which timezone?
---
I blame the blackout and the bots
---
The last bit will happen anyway especially now after cyno changes and the reduced risk of tackling a BS. And you can avoid at most half the killmails being posted by pulling your ESI out from zkill. It's not perfect but you can withhold a bit of intel and appear snuggly.
---
&gt; That's the difference.
---
so exactly as i just said - all that's different is who's killboard it's on.
---
Thanks, where do you go in game to find a corp? I'm assuming a Corp is like a guild?
---
If CCP put half the effort they've used on NPE (to no avail) towards not sending the current players into a death spiral, they may not be hurting for new blood so bad.
---
You're asking for a gang to kill you, a cruiser won't have that problem.
---
This killboard is everything mentality is one of the things im talking about when I say that the mentality is detrimental.
---
Ashy is a she, however this is a guest post and the author is a he
---
I agree. Nothing about being a line member will ever lead someone to being a better individual player. All I got from a null bloc is space to play in. The rest was misinformation from ~leet~ FCs/other members who told me which ship/fit to bring.
---
True
---
Coalition min maxers are basically the WOPR from War Games. they will always conclude "the only winning move is not to play."
---
hence the stagnation of nullsec and the long slow decline of Eve online.
---
I definitely want to nerf timezone tanking but since you could have an allied group outside your alliance trigger the repair. The way your suggestion would play out is everyone needing to attack right at the start of the 8-12 hour window which is effectively the same as it is now.
---
If ratting encourages something closer to a PVP fit, then ratters will be more willing and able to take part in home defense.
---
I think that CCP should try to encourage more manual piloting in fleets, and I feel that any sort of flak weapon should have very low damage-per-hit; only enough to threaten destroyers and frigates; the goal being to overwhelm logi with split dps, but I hadn't considered node-crash bombs. That's a very good point.
---
New players obviously, as they are the primary focus
---
Isn't the cap 500? or is that just for corp
---
That's simply not true.  Cruiser have the same problem. Even frigates have the problem.
---
Add more pockets of NPC nullsec with stations and agents. Good for hunters and runners. 
---
Add pirate faction capital blueprint copies to LP stores. Adjust the build requirements of all faction caps to be extremely high like the Serpentis ones. Create an analogue for the Serpentis Capital Microprocessor for each of the pirate factions - “Blood Raider Sacred Rites”, for example. Sotiyos are cheesable, RNG dominated cancer. 
---
Give black ops battleships T2 resists and change the ECM bonus on the Widow. At least make our pricy blops survivable now that they’re cyno-capable.
---
That’s all I got.
---
you do realise that the only people that care about killboard stats are the 'elite pvp' types - not the big blocs, right?
---
Because it required the use of a buggy UI. It's low rent even for the bottom feeders in Jita. Don't complain about new player retention if this unintended bug gets fixed that allows brainless scamming of new players.
---
What do you mean by five ships agression?
---
The guy with auto loot script for sotyios will have big surprise waiting on him :         
---
&gt;45677 - Blood Raider Molok Blueprint Armored Cache (Strong Boxes) Volume: 20000 =&gt; 400000.0
---
haha
---
&gt; Is an unarmed mining ship a juicy killmail? 
---
Yes, yes it is for a hull that costs 1m isk to destroy a hull that costs 330m
---
I don't participate in this, but I have spoken with several players that do.
---
The general consensus seems to be, cuz they're a bot, or they're clueless and
---
acting like one.
---
Personally, i think the catalyst is broke cuz it can literally double or triple the average dps of
---
any other destroyer, its like way too much over everything else.
---
But you just said that the difference is which killboard it shows up on. That implies that killboards matter to goons. Otherwise, why execute your own linemember? Just let him die if he's being dumb or is not following the guide lines
---
No, I totally get it, and as a general rule that is something you want to encourage in any MMO; however, I am still kind of concerned about the number of people I see in null sec who crab, while on comms with friends. 
---
This requires very little 'organization' time, and allows people to just quit doing what they are doing whenever. My concern is, again given the demographic of the game, that if you *force*, rather than offer, content that requires people to potentially dedicate more time than they think they have, at the end of the day you will actually see less people undocking or doing any content.
---
Not according to the killmail...
---
Your content inspired me to run abyssals and I really have been enjoying it. Thank you!
---
Yes and so will all the scrublord empires who won't get the loot either cause I with get that freighter killed 10/10 times :))
---
Anyone who thinks a freighter will survive on a grid with diamond rats and actually be able to loot it is in for a surprise.
---
I gave it my first ever silver.
---
ok let me explain why you doing dumb shit in your super is unnacceptable.
---
elite pvp types are the only one that cares about killboard stats, are you still with me? good.
---
if there are two groups. one group will feed you a shit fit super piloted by a mouth breathing retard each time you enter their space, and one that will do nothing but drop 30 supers on your frigate once your gate cloak expires.
---
where are you going to go every time?
---
oh right yeah, to the group that feeds you free kills. guess what everyone else and their mother is going to be doing when they see you get free super kills every time you turn up? they are going to do what you're doing. suddenly the region is swarming with hunters - this threatens the rest of the group, this is unnacceptable.
---
the easiest way to stop motherfuckers doing dumb shit they were told not to? remove their ability to do dumb shit.
---
13 mids? its only 9 from Omist, do you have low JDC or just a nonefficient route or something?
---
Which way do you think is more fun?
---
Forsaken hubs and below still exist, haven and sanctum ratting in supers/carriers won't.
---
Cyno changes introduce some requirements for the farming individuals themselves. 
---
Alliances will organize. I'm not sure individuals themselves will get smarter. Some will still survive. Some will dock. Some will die.
---
Even the change to the very binary dynamic of "tackle a cap, get counterdropped or kill the cap" is worth it. Previously you just wouldn't roam in places where you'll surely get dropped. Now it's worth going for any ratting carrier or Rorqual as you never know how the response will turn out. Even if more ships don't die, roaming is now more fun because it is less predictable.

&gt; All I got from a null bloc is space to play in.
---
which is what most people join for - it's the only reason i'm in a null bloc.
---
i can't hold sov on my own - and sov provides bonuses that i want.
---
i exchange a small amount of my time by going on a minimum of 1 op a month and following some very basic rules and i get access to content i wouldn't otherwise be able to benefit from.
---
i don't give a fuck about being some leet 1v1 frigates at the sun pilot - it's an irrelevance.
---
Its call fixing old out dated ui, most games aleady have a system like this and its frankly dumb it took them this long to fix.

If a ramjag gets anywhere near scram range they would just warp. I’ve flown enough ramjags in my time to know how that works
---
&gt; going about 160 kms in the direction I was ejected then 
---
I think this is your problem if noone has pointed it out, allow me.
---
when you are setting one of these up, *align* to the gate that you are coming from and burn towards it for about 160
---
this will make you be pointed directly at the gate, although with the establishing warp vector code, this seems to be a little wonky these days.

Oh no content in my region whatever will I do.

Use the motherfucker as bait. Don't save him and protect the ones that do follow the rules. It's almost as if null sec is dangerous...

Why build ships and assets if you're never going to use them. It's not like there is any big wars happening.

Wouldn't it be fairly safe to bring in the freighter only after field is clear, then Titan bridge the freighter to safety after scoop.
---
Ugh. I've scammed more super pilots than newbies with trades. 
---
I get it, if newbies are actually getting ripped off for their first 10mil t1 fit thorax, then whatever. But I don't think they are, because I know most of the good scammers in jita and they have a significantly higher minimum-effort margin.

---
TBH waiting for someone at CCP noticing that JF and Rorqual cannot have 400.000 m3 of cargo like they assumed.       
---
Then noticing that none of the sotyios cannot be run in enemy space as :          
---
* people don't have titans around New Eden so they need to gate freighter                
---
* freighter cannot cloack so you need to have structure in system or station where it can dock , as even if it warps off it will be instantly probed and will die.                    
---
* you need to prestage freighters if you want to contest the site, even if it will not drop anything. 
---
CCP make it ORCA size - this will ease people in lowsec, also people can use rorquals to pick up the cans if they drop in enemy space.
---
you don't want 'content' in your home region. you want your home to be secure so you can use the bonuses you get from owning space.
---
otherwise, you wouldn't bother owning the space.
---
Explo is more exciting. Fun when you find a 100 mil can of narrowly dodge a gank, less fun when you spend half an hour finding nothing but cherrypicked sites or lose your ship with half a bil in cargo to gankers.
---
hmmmmm worth?

It was tried. Only got 5 replies all extremely negative. Ofc the eve forums are dead compared to the sub so who cares.
---
I see these things *everywhere*. Deadspace sites, relic sites, combat sites; you name it, there's probably an old Amarr statue atop a dome somewhere nearby. While I don't necessarily *mind* this since it adds flavor to the game, the lore nerd in me gets...*twitchy* when I see it in a Serpentis relic site that's been laid out like the wrecked (Terran!) ships there actually have some sort of spiritual meaning to the biggest criminal corporation in the game.
---
Thanks man, after trying again and failing I took your advice and uninstalled the game
---
As long as local is a thing, the risk is extremely low for nullsec.
---
Ganking miners, mission runners, or salvagers in high-sec is *priceless*. Its about knowing the way someone feels when you warp to their mission pocket and vaporize their Golem. The satisfaction of being a bully is one of those great intangible things that keep people playing EVE.
---
Seriously, you guys are a bunch of psychopaths.

A vague title with a link to hoboleaks with no other explanation. Awesome.
---
Current spawn mechanic ^(looks like) that base on equal chance for each system.        
---
This leads to sotyios spawning in drone lands, angel space or guristas as those areas have few times more sytems than other.       
---
This leads to very rare spawns in serpentis, blood raider or Sansha space.              
---
Spawn mechanic is broken as simply sites are spawning in half of eve map, while almost totally ignoring the other.             
---
Solution is pretty simple :            
---
* make spawns only in NPC space that any one can contest with prestaged ships in region            
---
or          
---
* add 1 layer of randomness before choosing the system, aka choose pirate faction ... and then one of the system in this faction            
---
This leads to more equal spawns across the **map** of New Eden

He don't log in any less, either.

Hi with those fixes can you adjust sotyio spawn mechanic?     
---
Current mechanics focuses spawns in the half of the New Eden leaving other half dry.          
---
Please add 1 layer of randomness before choosing system :           
---
1. Choose random faction  where the site spawns            
---
2. Choose system within this faction

With the freighter needed to pick up the BPC can, there is no way to move such freighter into enemy territory and then get it safe unless you drop structure in system 24h earlier

There are ways to make 3b in a couple hours every single day without interruption. You just have to find a profitable niche and work hard at it. Just because something makes you a ton of money doesn’t mean its not working as intended. 
---
Plus, much ISK and time went into training for you to make that much? How many sub-cost dollars? I waited a year and spent a fit Titans worth on my golden goose.
---
How about you allow people to toggle the war notification
---
No, I will never stop complaining on reddit. That's what this site is for.
---
This. Item contracts already very clearly show things. People still manage to get scammed with them.
---
This'll cut down on the most silly of scams, like a good deal for a charon (carbon) but even those will still find victims... somehow.

Dumb change, stuff like ninja looting is what makes eve eve
---
No idea auto correct ****ed me
---
&gt; we could have docked the hulks on our Orca
---
If mining in highsec, it's probably a good idea to not use hulks in the first place. Skiffs are very tanky instead and will generally not get ganked if fit right.
---
Free intel is causing it. So because the risk goes down, people will bring more players? No.
---
&gt;And you can avoid at most half the killmails being posted by pulling your ESI out from zkill. It's not perfect but you can withhold a bit of intel and appear snuggly.
---
No, because the system is designed by an absolute retard that provides toon name in the KM. This is used to force profiles on players who do not want to be there.
---
Why do you think CCP make the cyno changes?
---
But I don't want to be pointed towards any gate. I just wanted an undock bookmark...
---
Oh, don’t do that unless you want to quit Eve. 
---
For reference, with Omega skills, lots of practice at hacking, scanning, and escaping, in the best region for explo, when prices were higher than they are now, I usually got around 100-120 mil/hr. Buying omega is 1.7-1.8 bil. That’s 15 hours of straight exploration just to buy omega, not including any deaths, or any other ships you want to buy. And starting out, you’ll be lucky to break 60 mil/hr,  not including losses. Which will happen frequently since, as an alpha, you can do nothing but die when you hit a gatecamp. 
---
Just either be happy to stay alpha for a while, or pay the $15.
---
I think you missed the big one, that probably drives this type of person most (though very akin to your #3)

People can risk nothing, invest nothing and blow up something belonging to someone else.

It's not like they don't like kicking over other people's sandcastles, but this type of person would generally never do it if they had any cost or consequences to doing it. :P
---
When all you have is a hammer...
---
All of the below assumes that Eve online is supposed to be a PvP game in the outer regions of space. 
---
With that in mind:
---
The fact that goons has grown to the size that enemies would rather just leave rather than even try to fight is what I mean about them not getting used. Do you like sitting in a giant ship shooting a structure? If so, congratulations, goons is for you. 
---
Sure, feroxes, megas, and other ships get used in fleet combat, but by now, even strat ops are coming up with either nothing or getting mega dunked. 
---
All of this farming that is taking place, all of this asset building is going nowhere. There is occasionally a big fight that happens every now and then, but no war of attrition is happening. The closest thing to it is the test and friends vs frat and friends war. Even then, the engagements are replaced before they are even fought. 
---
And that's fine. If that's the way the game is in null, that's fine. But it's stagnant. There's no one going to battle just because. Everyone is too busy playing Farmville in space to really want to do anything. 
---
This is turning more into a rant but fuck it im already here. 
---
Mechanics is one half of the equation, but when those are changed, i.e. blackout, you get massive community backlash. Mentality and culture is the other half. 
---
One of those has to change for this game to live and it's obvious that the Krabs in null sec complain louder than anyone when the mechanics change so the other one needs to change. 
---
The mentality currently is fall on line or we kill you for it because we don't want content at home. Problem is, "home" now consumes multiple regions and even your neighbors are in NIP agreements meaning there is very little risk of anything actually happening. 
---
Killing your own line members for content denial just doesn't make sense to me. I get that people just want to login, make some isk or build a thing and log out and that's fine, but this complete safety mentality is atrocious. You're in null sec and it's supposed to be dangerous. If you don't want to live in a dangerous place, move back to high sec.
---
I have a lot of free time, and I used to mine, so I know it takes a while.
---
It wasn't, but when it was left for much longer than it was originally announced for people started to assume it would be. Source: /r/Eve
---
&gt; All of the below assumes that Eve online is supposed to be a PvP game in the outer regions of space.
---
it's not a pvp game, it's a sandbox game.
---
you're basing everything after that statement on an incorrect assumption.
---
&gt;  It's just insulting to hear ccp say we can't do it.
---
Have they done this?
---
You said, i was aligning to the dock, if you make it the way i describe, you will warp in from the gate aligned to the station, because you made the bookmark between the station and the gate, not the direction the station put you out at.
---
Why CCP is so focused on making EVE more safe I've no idea.
---
&gt;Why do you enjoy making people angry? 
---
A lot of people, if given opportunity to behave very negative (on someone else) with no consequence, do. It's the same thing that causes trolls etc. on the internet to do what they do.
---
Also, to most people, behaving in a fictional world is not linked to their IRL behaviour / personality. Bringing up IRL behaviour doesn't really help explain behaviour in a game in any way.
---
Okay, suppose you have a module. You abyss roll it. How does the probability work?
---
Is it evenly distributed (no bias towards one end of the spectrum or the other)?
---
Is it independent (modifier on one stat does not affect chances of other stats)?
---
Where is the mean value? If I roll a stat that has a modifier ranging from -20% to +5%, is it 50% likely to be below 0 or 80% likely to be below 0?
---
&gt;wouldn't roam in places where you'll 
---
I mean, if Delve is any indicator your statement is false. Pre-cyno change and pre-blackout we almost always had roamers in Delve. They even did stuff like trying to blap supers and rorquals when the chances of being dropped were 90%.
---
Totally right, i thought the same thing. They should hire an italian designer lol
---
Are you in the same goons that dropped a 200 man titan/super fleet on 20 man Iki fleet the other day? What goon response fleet is ever outnumbered by anything that comes into Delve?
---
razor still exists?
---
Nice salt.
---
&gt;be able to light cynos. Without HIC cynos tackling supers in lowsec and being able to bring in forces to kill them is heavily restricted.
---
Covert cynos are broken, less so now that the blackout is gone, but broken. Then again, maybe it is just bombers that are broken.
---
Because Eve at its core is a game about interaction with other players.  It is by and large not satisfying to play for an extended period without it.  There are exceptions to every rule, of course, and there are doubtless a handful of players out there content to mine, build, and otherwise be completely self-sufficient, but even the most PvE-oriented of players has to interact with the market at a bare minimum.
---
Engaging with the multiplayer aspects is thus key to keeping any decent proportion of players around.  However, the NPE has a hard time initiating that since it (and the career mission arcs) kind of have to be solo by definition.  A new player would be forgiven for trying the game for a few hours and then quitting without ever interacting with another player.  Getting ganked is a kickstart on the path to engaging with other players.  It's not necessarily the best or only way to get new players on that path, but fundamentally that's the reason for those numbers.
---
Mining tends to be a pretty static progression to bigger and bigger mining ships.
---
T1 production is really straightforward and really hard to make money from. Especially in Jita where the real volumes are.
---
Most of the "meta 0" T1 modules are almost only made as input to T2 modules. T2 modules \*can\* be profitable and there's a giant rabbit hole of optimization and tweaking if you like that sort of things. Materials for T2 mostly have to be bought (as the moon goo that goes into them is varied and it's nearly impossible to even have access to all of it by design) but you can optimize profits by building components yourself from raw moon goo where it's cheaper. Really rewards the spreadsheet warriors and those that are patient and buy input materials from buy orders.
---
Nice thing about manufacturing is that it's really easy to start and stop at any time. Not like running a site or PvP'ing where you have to commit a real time window. Very "baby" friendly if you will.
---
You either don't know what an insta undock bookmark is or you misunderstood my post.
---
Goddamn I didn't know BBTB had a fan club!
---
Lol
---
So, in summary:
---
* Triglavians are getting some new things. A "Stellar Fleet Spawner" which sounds like some sort of conduit but is classified as a cloud and appears to be part of a CONCORD-sponsored mission, a "Chislov" Leshak, a "Stellar Fleet Laboratory" that seems to cause an environmental effect when destroyed, as well as a freaking *dreadnought!* Definitely looking forward to that! (Especially if the "friendly" variant is *actually* friendly, lol)
---
* New cerebral accelerators along with BPs for them, and [Kostenadza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Costanza#/media/File:George_Costanza.jpg) implants are back! YAY!
---
* Rogue Drones are getting infested battleships, which I'm definitely looking forward to seeing in action. They need more love, and I eventually hope they become an actual faction we can interact with *aside* from just blowing them up.
---
A hordling once told me that they never drop caps!
---
I will say it again, cynos were heralds of cancer far more often than fun.
---
F
---
Rookies getting trade window scammed leads to them getting discouraged and quitting.
---
Yep
---
New players aren't the people being scammed. It is idiots with supers, rorquals, and Titans. People who should know better not to instantly accept trades. 
---
Also, this is part of the EVE universe. It's what makes EVE...EVE. This isn't WoW. You can lose all your shit if you aren't careful. This change is advocated for a safer more pandering universe.
---
Costanza imo.
---
OH WELL.
---
HI IT'S ME YOUR FRIEND THE CONTRACT WINDOW
---
Escort it. With ships.
---
&gt;p then? Hics can't be repped while they have point up and a massive sig penalty. Supers can near alpha hics with 3 heavies 2 lights out after they wipe out the cap and hardeners with a cycle from capital neuts.
---
They made the change in attempt to directly nerf super-umbrellas, which personally I think is an incredibly stupid idea, by keeping cynos off of capital ships and null sec ratting ships. I do not think CCP really cared one bit about cynoceptors or cynoibises, despite what they say.
---
The problem is that that goes both ways if all you focus on is the extremes. One side sees terrible people whose sole goal is destroying other people's enjoyment and do nothing but troll, harm other playstyles with no consequences and generally be a toxic aspect to the game. The other side sees people that are sore losers and turn to RL threats at the drop of a hat.
---
Having something to actually focus that anger on in the game would help for the "ganked" party, but ganking explicitly has no counterplay so all they're left with is directing the anger at the player on the other end.
---
I guess you’ll have to pay for your stuff now RIP
---
They aren't trade window scammed because they have nothing to trade. People who do this sort of scamming don't care about new players because that is not their focus. Instead, they focus on players with titans, supers, dreads, etc. Items which should not be in the hands of a new players.
---
Now, if a new player uses their CC to buy their way into a Titan or similarly large ship, then by all means we'll scam it from them. It's part of the EVE universe to be able to lose everything. Whether that be by being shot at and subsequently exploding or by other means.
---

So if I come in with my trusty Covert ops hunter, lets say a bomber. I decloak, I point your ratting carrier or whatever. THen I press the cyno button. Stay in space with T1 resists (which all covops lighting ships have) for 5 full minutes (5 times longer than the cycle time) before people can bridge/jump with covert ops ships to me. Tell me exactly how a subcap is going to survive 5 mins against a cap alone without help? If I refit a cap to a propmod and burn straight away from you, I will outrange your point and warp out before the 5 minute mark if I am not just shooting you down first.
---
Same with a Heavy interdictor. They are bricks, but not really made to Face tank a capital alone for 5 minutes. Lets say hics can light cynos with 5 minutes delay, you warp on a carrier ratting. What you think is happening first, the carrier killing you or 5 minutes passing. Hell in that time basically every ratter can show up to whore on the KM
---
It really doesn't matter if the player is new or not wrt justifying this change.  The scam is only viable because the game's UI is bad.  They're improving the UI.  It is a good thing.
---
and?
---
show me a game that doesn't have rules.

Their decision breaks a core part of EVE. It is not a good thing.

For them to be able to get reps they'd need to cut hic tank in half. A max tank/link hic gets comparable ehp to an unfit carrier. Hics tank more than makes up for it, it's already extremely difficult to kill a pair of coordinated hics with logi.
---
They did blackout and too many players stopped playing. CCP is beholden to the community and unfortunately the bulk of the community wants safety.
---
Yay, we get our own dreads!

At minimum, I’d say buy two months of subscription, use that to train into a buzzard, covert cloak, and get your scanning/archeology (ignore data sites, they aren’t worth it) skills up. Once you have that, it’s a lot easier to get money
---
This hurts my heart :(
---
Where is my long lost grimdark universe? Where are the HTFU's?
---
This scam is most common in Jita (no titans or supers) and affect new players almost exclusively. Really this is a good, be it, very small step toward improving new player retention. Don't get me wrong, im not saying scamming itself is the issue, but i dont mind when they tighten down on the low hanging fruit (lazy scams) that affect newbros most.
---
I know who roams in Delve. It isn't (pre or post blackout) being roamed wrt how packed with targets it is. You can't talk about merely the number of people roaming in isolation from how much targets there are. If you have half of farm rorquals, supers, carriers; you have to get half of people roaming in Eve or else you're a negative to the ecosystem.
---
So having cap's there will insure they can have things like SRP and more isk? It's more about small corps and alliances learning and wanting to live in space a bit more dangerous and profitable than highsec but can't contend with medium/large alliances or the mega coalitions.
---
 I know low sec still needs work and the citadel spam surely hasn't helped any but having cap's and supers dropped on you all the time in low sec just pushes more and more people to the mega coalitions or out of the game because there is no where else to go but highsec or join one of the big blocs. There is no middle ground and most people don't want to live in wormholes because they will just get evicted. In low sec its almost impossible to get evicted because of npc stations.
---
&gt; and affect new players almost exclusively.
---
This absolutely untrue. All trade scammers focus on pilots with assets worth a lot of isk. That is, supers, titans, and other items worth lots of isk. New players are NOT often trade scammed because they literally have nothing to trade.
---
It's a UI bug. It isn't intended. Adapt. Go back to spamming local.
---
Or tracking down a gigantic asteroid, building engines all over it, and then setting it on a collision course with an enemy citadel. The system would in all likelihood be broken as hell and/or impossible to implement, but it would sure be fun to watch!
---
This is because EVE is not a PvP game, whatever the marketing says. It is a resource gathering sandbox game, where PvP is only an option and used by the minority of the players. This game is like Civilization in space. You can have PvP, but most of the time there is no reason for it, so most of the people don't do it.
---
The "core thing" I reference of the HTFU mentality which EVE was built upon. Here it is explained well: https://forums.eveonline.com/t/october-further-qol-new-player-focused-changes/191022/21?u=shadowozera1
---
Er'ree day
---
A sandbox game of which PvP is a core component in the **outer regions of space**
---
The game stagnates when you remove a core component, which goons have. Not completely of course, things still die in delve. If you want to kill eve, continue to remove aspects of the sandbox by controlling how a line member can do things. 
---
All im saying is that the mentality of null is negatively affecting the player retention. Part of that is when they start killing their own line members. Eve is touted as a sandbox MMO with giant space battles that happen in the lawless outer regions of the map. It's no wonder why people don't stay when they get Farmville 2: Farmville in space in the outer regions.
---
Nerfing different ways to make isk is a bad thing. HTFU and go back to mining.
---
agreed, i miss the old phobos paintjob
---
&gt; Second, wow you really thought that i've bought a skin without even take a look on it?
---
No your words implied you decided to buy something before looking to see what there is to buy. I would not go to the store determined to buy something and then complain because i got something i didn't like/need. If they didn't have anything i wanted or needed i would simply leave.
---
&gt;I just want to buy a skin for a couple of ship that i frequently use because i have damn 5 dollar to burn,

You should put it in the feedback of the website then not on a public forum where anyone can comment.

Only one Super/Titan production upgrade per region. One Sotiyo per region with only a handful of build queues.

That would definitely be nice. I've seen some really pretty stuff in Elite: Dangerous and putting that potential in EvE would definitely convince me to go sightseeing.

Dude.. you just said that said that. Do I have to dig up a quote? Every time it comes up they say they "can't" if they came out and said it's not worth the Dev time then fine. But I haven't heard that I've heard it's too hard. That's the excuse my 7 yo gives me when she doesn't want to do something and that's not good enough from professionals.
---
nullsec doesn't seem stagnant to me. did'nt goons just glass all of NC PL recently?  as for the game, ccp is desperately trying to kill it so people move over to their mobile platform.
---
Print it as large as you can and post it next to your screen.  The sites are generated, there's no consistency to map.

You are tied to the fax as they are immobile while in triage and useless out of triage. 2 fax is not usually needed, triaged fax cannot be repped and if active tanked, they can either perma tank or die in a fire. Buffer faxes again either live long enough for the subs to win and hold the field or die before triage ends. Long slug fests might have fax swapping triage but then you run out of cap boosters and the whole thing falls flat.
---
I know nothing of cap heavy fights but I expect in that scenario whoever churns through the other side's faxes with their supers/titans wins and faxes never live long enough to be repped in that scenario 2-4 doomsday should kill a buffer apostle and 10 supers should eat one every what, 10-15 seconds?
---
How you know you won the fight when there’s more hostility out of PanDaFam on reddit than in 03-4.  
---
Fucking joke of a coalition.
---
Besides Anom and cyno suggestions, this is a good list. I would nitpick and point out the flaws there. Probably put those on the backburner until the other things are sorted.
---
Honestly, the math works out that 1 fax is the same as 4 T2 logis in cost.
---
God the salt is goooooood tonight

There are other regions than Delve to roam.
---
Lack of mobility is the big killer. That fax is not moving once it's triaged. Any opponent with higher mobility will leave or kite.
---
&gt; which goons have.
---
yes, the only entity to actively deploy their supercaps in the last what, 2 years? are the ones who have removed pvp.
---
come the fuck on mate, who are you kidding here? show me any entity that has mobilised as many pvp assets as they have in the last 24 months.
---
NPC stations in the Drone Regions, TIA!
---
Cripes.  They're not taking away the ability to scam.  They aren't even telling you you're not allowed to scam via the trade window.  They're improving a UI that can be deceptive, or, at worst, flat out lie to the player.
---
&gt;Its too easy to just gank them with a small fleet.
---
That's actually a great side-effect. Encorage groups to form into small-group fleets to go ratting - sorta like 5-player dungeons in WoW.  More social than everyone AFK ratting.
---
I have often soloed 1 vs 10. And that is totally fine. A single cap on field and you can't do that anymore.
---
I'm always skeptical of complaints like this. I'm in a freakin enormous alliance, which is itself in an even larger coalition, and I'm swimming in content.
---
Are there some boring blueball stratops? Yeah, of course. Plenty. When that happens you just have fun shooting the shit with guys on Mumble, and chalk it up to the price of having fun the rest of the time. A big part of the appeal of Eve to me is that it takes legit work to accomplish cool stuff. If you want the cool stuff without doing the work, you're just free riding. 
---
Like, what's the balance of content to blueball ops you go on? If it's 50/50 and it still upsets you, I feel like maybe you should go play a game with more instant gratification. It's its worse than that, you need a better alliance that takes fights.
---
They probably think that why bother making good clothes and skins when no one ever sees either because there's no more walking around and in space you're zoomed out so you could be a barf of purple and pink and you'd never know it? ;)
---
Bad UI design I guess
---
I should have clarified: Removed PvP in their home region. Good for them. Krab in near complete safety. Build those big ol toys to destroy frigates with
---
Which yes, they have deployed.
---
Please show me the brs where these epic battles occurred against the enemies.
---
Or are you talking about the undefended structures you guys killed. 
---
Good job on that one. Want a sticker?
---
I fly my fax like once every few months (small lowsec PvP alliance), I fly my guardian almost every week, sometimes multiple times a week and I'm *always* welcome in fleet, you always get "I need one more guardian, please someone x up" in comms. I don't care who's fleet I'm on.
---
Maybe they make it so that simple + attribute implants are covered by insurance clones? That way players will be more likely to buy the implants in order to speed up their skill training without having to worry about getting podded and losing a set of implants worth millions.
---
Just a thought.
---
Hmmmm or.... small gang stay in low sec where they belong?  Make low sec (and eve) great again!!
---
Also, a structure/item/module something that can turn off local in a system until it's killed.
---
Devotee could get a buffer nerf maybe, but Broadsword, Onyx, and espically Phobos don't.
---
GET UP AND RORQ MINE LIKE THE REST OF US! SCAMMERS ARE A BLIGHT ON THIS GAME'S HONOURABLE MINING COMMUNITIES!
---
I get that people feel this way but it's not what eve is supposed to be about :(
---
you mean the fights we didn't have because everyone but goons refused to actually go and pvp?
---
if you want to be mad that "big blocs" don't pvp - goons aren't the ones that are actively avoiding pvp.
---
seems you just get upset that people in delve won't feed you free kills - if you don't like the flavour of pvp you find in delve, try TKE?
---
It'll definitely be more interesting if a PVP fit and a PVE fit overlapped more. When I'm out running a site in my PVE ship, if anything pops on Dscan I'm gonna be out. I don't have points, I don't have webs, I'm all in on one type of resists that my hunter is already aware of. You'd get some decent content attacking ratters of any variety if it was possible for the ratter to be out in a fit that could take a real fight and still PVE efficiently.
---
Just checked, i had 12 mids last I checked the route for structures. Could take a shortcut via stain but meh. Could also "optimise" the route in impass - catch but i like the structures i use there. Have plenty of cyno characters and 2 jf pilots. So the trip goes fast and the pilots with low fatigue ready to drop on frat or a save.
---
You seem like a fun kinda guy
---
This, SO MUCH. Not only will it get players used to PvP tactics that they can practice against rats (who will still be dumber/weaker than actual players because there's only so much the AI can do) but it will also give people running NPC sites a fighting chance against someone who decides to drop in on them because the fits are either identical or similar enough to not make much of a difference.
---
Yes, it's like a guild.  It's in your "hamburger" menu at the top left inside one of the drop downs.
---
Game rules and player imposed rules are not the same thing. One is a limit on what you can do within the programming of the game, and the other is another player telling you that you can't do a certain part of the game because it looks bad for them.
---
I bought the game and pay money for it so I can enjoy it, not so I can have some dude who barely logs in tell me what I can and cannot do in it.
---
Glad I left null blocs a long time ago. Haven't had this much fun in this game since I joined it years ago.
---
As someone else pointed out, you have to go through that anyway. Amarr is the way to go first, followed by minmatar and caldari (which one first depends on your alliance's doctrines). Gallente is distant last. It's only like 60-90 days extra to get all 3 vs. going straight for one of the faxes and faxes is a whole lot of staying docked / at logging screen waiting for call to login / jump that might never come and then dying (triaged faxes always die if the fight is lost, triage is basically self tackle.)
---
T2 logi is being part of the fleet from the start and actually having an active role in all the fights, not waiting for an escalation or a ping that might never come.
---
/CCP_Lebowski Please take a look at these.  Most of the info in there has cross-community support.
---
"hey guys, what do you mean i can't be on your team because i don't want to participate in the stratergy you're employing?"
---
This is incredibly far from what i've observed. Anyone that has played a decent amount of time knows about this scam and how easy it is to not encounter.
---
The decision not to blue test and fight for content lol. Tests desire to have everything blue is pathetic.
---
I do it from FW lowsec when I do because I'm a filthy -9 pirate anyway. But I don't run t4 in blinged out gilas either.
---
Decent point, I'll raise this with the team, thanks!
---
how can they attract new players when the old one are just bored AF and some of them burnout frequently (including myself)  
---
history of great fight empire building and shit like that bring me to Eve but now i know everything about that and understand that's just "a joke" (fake conflicts, fake risk, boring mechanic, blue donut-land, time consuming AF...." just say "Stay away"   
---
Eve can't be attractive his gameplay is awfull and in intuitive if CCP want new players they should entirely rework their game, some small change are great like skill on demand but thats not "NPE" you just make something stupid less stupid, if you really want new players then make them dream about Eve and for that we need great war again not just annual structure bash or grind-simulator-online

---
not perfect but a good begining
---
No. These changes aren't only for null sec, and they're not only for umbrella type defence.
---
They are also there so that _any_ common ship in LS can't cyno snuff titans on your head. 
---
By having a recon you advertise cyno ability. Having potential cyno's on any t1 cruiser breaks this.
---
Goons originated on the Something Awful forum. They are frenemies because they're so big there's not much else that is large enough for them to shoot at.
---
&gt; It will never be interesting if ratting is a solo activity.
---
Then maybe make rat sites using the new AI and ships that are best done as a group? Bringing a dozen or so people along to fight the rats as a team effort would be a nice opportunity to learn how to command a fleet and work together as part of a group.
---
I don't disagree. They've removed the time sink required to hit "end game" and are handcuffed to expecting a majority of players to have multiple accounts for PVE because it scales in a broken manner.
---
Good analogy. All the buildup to the moments of crazy makes the crazy even better.
---
PanDaFam is a little more than 18k dude
---
I don't think this is true.
---
Gone are the days where tackling a maller means snuff titans or hull pen dreads land on your head
---
It just sounds like less dynamic, slower paced, more expensive FW plexes but with fewer fights per time invested.
---
"Yes" but it takes a really long time to get there. Most of your standing loss will be with the other side's militia corp and not the faction.
---
At that level, your job is more to babysit krabs than have fun.
---
bLuInG aLl Of EvE iS sO fUcKiNg OrIgInAl YoU gUyS
---
You realy think 83k in all tz will field less then 18k which play in 1 tz? Even if you divide the 83k with 3 for au/us/eu tz you still come up with way more then 18k. And then there are the guys that play in more then 1 tz.
---
No. That would negate my whole point of taking auto aggression  off, and making it possible for large multi boxers only having to recall drones, warpe next site and launch drones. Rather then having to actually pay attention and order drones around.
---
No. Im not upset because im not getting free kills. 
---
What I mean is that goons has farmed so much and gotten so big that fighting them is simply the same as right click, trash ship. You've done this by blueing everyone under the sun that's near you, or crushing the tiny alliances that don't fall in line and then using that entire mega force to just kill literally everything. The fact that capital ships are the most efficient things to kill sub capitals is one problem. A problem which needs mechanic changes to fix. The other problem is the blueing of every single neighbor and then killing blues if they dont fit their ship a certain way. 
---
Goons have removed PvP and instead brought in NIPs that essentially kills any true invasion style PvP by neighbors. Again. What goons has done is definitely part of the sandbox and s totally viable way to play, but the stagnation of the game due to politics over PvP is the problem. That's all im saying. The only PvP that goons and other null blocs bring is limited engagements between mega blobs. And even that is getting fewer and far between. 
---
We used to have major wars every summer but it's now to the point of goons just deploying capital fleet, right click, jump, kill undefended structure, go home, build more big ships. Is that really fun for you?
---
You talk of me being salty about not getting easy kills, goons only get easy kills with mega blobs. 
---
I rarely ever travel to delve now because of the capital response meta. I'd much rather fight a gang 4 to 1 in sub caps than 20 to 1 where the defender has capitals on every gate. Take a look at my killboard. It's not pretty, but it's fun.
---
You could enlist your corp into Factional Warfare. You would immediately be allied with other corps in your faction. You could join their fleets with your corp to learn pvp basics. Eventually even find a cool alliance to join. Better to join alliance who you have already played and fleeted with than just randomly joining someone who says that they are cool but actually aren't.
---
Just tell everyone to make highsec hauling/market alts and maybe even mining alt if you enjoy that. You have 3 slots for characters on your account so you should use that option if you join FW. Because joining FW is bit like 24/7 wardec. Though doing FW plexes in lowsec as a group will earn your corpmates a lot more isk than they would make mining.
---
As someone who's last 8 years have been customer service, you don't even need the ability to talk to people for some places. 
---
So happy to be done with that shit.
---
Get a room you two - burn off some of that excess energy like two rabid hyenas.
---
I think first you should know about half the jargon is just typical MMO stuff with the lingo changed.
---
We dont say guild we say corp, we dont say quest we say mission, we dont say mob we say rat (pirate), we dont say gate we say cyno, etc.
---
No you just measure others based on an idd definition of batphoneing
---
True enough. I've never had to work Customer Service, but I've had friends that did and I've worked for plenty of companies that had their own departments...and it amazed me what type of people they hired.
---
God I love that Prodigy album.
---
Right im sure they’ll stop killing shit after this last Fort lol
---
Let me explain with other word.
---
The only store in the town sell only orange apparels, and dont have any clothes for my size (legion).
---
From years he still only have orange or red clothes, and the other option are go to the vintage store and buy a blue t-shirt for 400$ that went out of production.
---
Now if there is another store i could go there to buy my clothes, but there is any store, neither a fabric that would allow you to design and produce your style clothes.
---
Now after years and years, yes i could do a legit rant because there is still no t-shirt for my size, because i have the money and i want to buy another t-shirt after 5 years.
---
Games like League of legend litterally make millions with skins, i cant see why they are not getting that people would buy more skin or exterior mods to customize their ships. They could really make tons of money for just adding a pallette color system like warframe or "hats" like team fortress.
---
Thank you for posting this thread. I fit up a retribution and tried to run a filament only to learn that I needed cruisers. Apparently conduits and filaments are different.
---
This is a legit complaint. But it's not the one you presented in your OP.
---
Ill take all that except putting cynos on hics.
---
I haven't seen my boots in a decade :(
---
When tapi need help from goons every timer, frat kinda has to ask others for help.
---
Guess origin. ahoudlnt have wydotted. If they hadn't they could of just left and been not my fight. 
---
370 person battled are healthy for the game as it gets more publicity to the game.
---
You just described incursions. Problem is anyone who comes to gank incursions will just bring more than the  incursion runners, and then just dunk them. 
---
There has to be a limit to how much the attackers can bring, or a way for the defenders to respond and bring reinforcements before they loose all thier ships.
---
the mentality of "If it's too good to be true. it isn't"
---
I live all these idiots complaining about batphoning. It's like 60 goons whoring a *totally uncontested structure*. Bunch of histrionic little bitches up in here.
---
As Sergeant Schlock once put it: ["Sometimes you have fun, and sometimes the fun has you."](https://www.schlockmercenary.com/2003-04-07)
---
Which is a problem with no easy solution, because good tactics and strategies involve stacking the deck in your favor as much as humanly possible, and being on the receiving end of a curbstomp just isn't fun.
---
When yea cause goons showed up more often than Panfam  .. do you even kill board? Don’t even have to be in that conflict to see through that weak narrative.
---
There's probably one that can spawn a faction frigate extremely rarely and which could drop up to \~300m in loot in the best possible case. And if that happens to you, hang up your hat and stop playing, you've expended all the luck you'll be afforded, ever.
---
Otherwise, it's literally nothing. If you want to do combat mission like thing that drop good loot, look into DED 1/10, 2/10, 3/10 and similar. They are on the same level as L1/L2 missions in terms of difficulty but they can drop actually valuable loot with regularity. That said, they have limited spawn rates and are heavily farmed and must be probed.
---
Anoms can also be done for the rare faction spawn and the more common escalations but that might require going to lowsec and/or upshipping for the escalations.
---
The rolls are all independent, the distribution in the range seems linear, so 80% likely to be below 0.
---
&gt;As with the last package, these changes are primarily focused on improving the experience for pilots in their first few hours and days in New Eden
---
You're doing it right. 
---
Please continue on this course; more new players will go a long way towards alleviating many of the problems EVE currently faces.
---
Are you an actual chef? Looks amazing
---
Yup exactly how I feel about both.
---
55,688m range on Meson ... you're running a Strong Frentix, right?
---
I'm pretty broke right now, hence why I'm trying to get it with ISK.
---
So a further slide into frigates online, hold on to your butts.
---
Not for much longer
---
Let’s be real the south war is giving 0 publicity for the game. Nobody give a fuck, this war doesn’t even have a name. 
---
For Origin. It may be hard to understand or believe from the outside but we are not really into FRT. Don’t get me wrong we are in their alliance and have access to their services, but we are not under any obligation from the alliance leadership. With the current sov mechanic you kinda need to be in the defensive alliance if you want to fight for them. And tbh the BL ticker was getting to strong, FRT give us way more engagement possibilities.
---
Flaring up?  I haven't heard about spontaneous combustion since the early '80s.
---
And it's been alphaed by supers.
---
So Lonely and no friends :(
---
Why the fuck they didn't recreate dust 514 for PC. They tried to make a new pc shooter and the gameplay demo they showed us was most horrible demo I've ever seen. They already had the perfect product they could have just iterated on. Uh oh.
---
setup an access list, make corp leaders the managers/admin of the list
---
blue everything on it, red everything that is blocked.
---
Just like life
---
I have an idea to improve the game. On the logoff screen where we are asked "did you enjoy playing the game today", can we have an uninstall button next to the downvote button?
---
While there are elements of cyberpunk in the lore (reminiscent of the schismatrix Bruce sterling stories and all) eve is probably more traditional space opera a la The Expanse than even far future cyberpunk a la Pat Cadigan.
---
It certainly plays around with the tropes when it comes to capsuleers. I mean, capsuleers are basically free-floating digitized consciousness that can move from body to body. Reminds me of... well reminds me of a lot of cyberpunk. Altered Carbon comes to mind as one of the more recent (although the books came out in the early oughts.) The SOMA game. Brain uploading is a common transhuman/cyberpunk trope.
---
Great content as usual.  I'm surprised no one has commented on your great choice of music for your vids.  Thanks again.
---
Right. Cause bait wasn't a thing back when you could have a tackle and a cyno on a ratting ship.
---
Mayo? Mustard?
---
In other words, make a tedious part of eve more tedious? There are actions for the sake of making things better and actions that make things worse. This would make things worse.
---
I d love a good ole Zerg in EVE...
---
Just dualbox logi alt. Problem solved ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Ok, so the reason blackout failed is because hunters could unavoidably gank anyone without any warning or retaliation. On the other hand, the game will stagnate if its possible to have perfectly safe space where you can only loose a ship if youre not paying attention.
---
Local blackout itself is awesome. In almost no case should players be able to get perfect, instant, risk-free intel. They should, however, be able to defend thier space from looters, if they fight them on relatively equal terms when the attackers do decide to come in. Creating safe space should come at a tradeoff that makes you vulnerable in other ways.
---
Like, if you want local, it also cynojams  the system. Or, a cyno inhib also creates prevents cloaking in the aoe
---
A couple active gatecamps should be able to stop even cloaky nullified roamers from breaking into space, but that impenetrability makes the gatecamp vulnerable to assault.
---
Maintaining a vulnerable military presence at the gates to your kingdom protects the farmers, but gurantees a fight for an attacker, and allows that to escalate.
---
My whole entire play style and enjoyment in the game is currently spearfishing enemy fleets away from their triage or logi. I would be open to this idea if CD destroyers we’re immune to to effect, but leaves the ships snagged on the cool down. Currently in WHs you have perma point hics, LR point proteus and a plethora of small ships chasing you 24/7.
---
Decidedly not.
---
You do know that hatred towards miners was a social engineering construct to get people to train drakes, right? You aren't actually supposed to believe it.
---
Actually, outfighting known blobbers is the most fun.  And there were groups who did that.  But alas, there isn't much rock-paper-scissors or piloting skill in cap warfare.
---
Whose life are you improving the quality of? Honestly, there isn't a lot there.
---
Fix kikimora vs interceptor balance
---
&gt; Dude.. you just said that said that.
---
Did I? To be clear it's actual curiosity, not trying to call you out or argue with you about it. I am legitimately curious if they have ever actually said they can't do it versus a more nuanced phrasing.
---
Still, "can't" is accurate here for all practical purposes. If they had a bigger team and a more time and there wasn't already a massive list of more important problems they could likely do it. But since none of those things are the case, they can't.
---
It's too bad we don't get to see sun graphics often with normal gameplay. 
---
That's one thing I like about elite dangerous. When you drop out of jump as you're hopping between systems, it dumps you out right at the star, so you can admire the graphics all of the time (or burn to a crisp if you're too close).
---
&gt; Why didnt CCP just create a specialised cyno ship that was probably cruiser sized costing 50mill
---
They did that, it's just it's BC sized and costs 300 mil.
---
mega cringe
---
*popcorn intensifies*
---
Why can't you bring a HIC and a recon?
---
This post right here, this is how you regain your lost virginity. Godbless
---
Hmmm
---
posting in a spicy thread
---
Covert cynos are a bit broken, but a 5 minute delay just removes them from the game. I still think all cynos should have a spool up similar to the inhib (which I'd probably bring down to 30s, not the current 1 min) so you can actually drop an inhibitor and have it work.
---
Honest question. You’re a csm. Why do you hate eve so much? You’re trying to blue the last group left in the game putting up a real fight.
---
e
---
Nuts!
---
tL;dr: Legacy offers to blue the last remaining neutrals, contacted Guiness World Records and paid the registration fee to get the WR of "Most blues in a garbage spaceship game"
---
&gt; we will treat you much the same as we would Providence or any other neutral entity
---
Actually quite a lot, because the targets for small gangs could (and often did) have a cyno and drop capitals on you. That meant you had no option but to fly super kitey and on the edge of disengage. But now you can't have brick tanked cyno ships (a small gang might fancy its chances against the recon).
---
They really don’t like you guys.
---
“Neutral”
---
Thats a dead playstyle unless you’re ratting in sins.
---
Congrats for killing the only content You dino brains have.
---
"we will treat you much the same as we would Providence or any other neutral entity."
---
Reading is hard.
---
He seems to dislike Snuff Box. I'm not really sure who they are though. I heard hes really close with Snuffed Out and works with Hywanto regularly.
---
 D0nnieDark0 turning in his grave at the news of SNUFF BOX being hounded until death by TEST ALLIANCE PLEASE IGNORE
---
That’s definitely an option, but the idea woukd be to shut down the cyno before things load. 3 af’s aren’t going to kill a cyno that fast.
---
if thats how you read it.... thats not how it works
---
Vily how do I aim a boson?
---
Vertiso pls
---
Treat you like Providence, did you even read it?
---
Eh, delete logi.
---
Sincerely, a logi.
---
Firstly I agree going on ops in a doctrine ship is fine supporting your alliance is great. What I don't agree with is corps threatening their members with Awox or corps not allowing people to use their own fit on fun ops.
---
Oh sorry, you are right. I shouldve asked : What flavour of blue is :" cant invade and will defend if invaded"
---
All looks great.
---
It's excellent that they've fixed the trade window to make it actually functional. I don't understand why they've left it broken for so long, tbh. Scamming through bad game mechanics isn't clever and it isn't good for the game. People expect a double-confirmation trade window to give them a secure trade, as it does in every other game, and for it not to do so is just bad UX.
---
He's trying to save us all from a witnessing a long, slow death of the game by killing it quickly and mercifully.
---
There's also incidents where random idiots like myself take some corp mates, have fun, shoot enemies, die, and get SRP'd for it.
---
"What kind of a F\*\*\*\*\* do you have to be" Vily - 2k19
---
Well sure but then what's the point of even having the trade window if it doesn't work.
---
Scamming people by outthinking them is fine and part of Eve. Scamming people by bad UI is not good for anything.
---
Again, simply wrong on many counts. Gankers often gank on -10 characters, which can be freely attacked in hisec at any time. Basic mechanics.
---
Even if not, as soon as they aggress, they are freely attackable. Basic mechanics. This is how antigankers operate every day, and mining ships defeat ganks every day, in hisec. It’s by no means a foregone conclusion. This is a complete misconception.
---
You seem to have this defeatist attitude... 15 seconds is forever if you’re paying attention.  You keep saying you can do nothing and this is simply wrong. You seem to be speaking from a position of no actual knowledge on the topic, just a hyper-pessimistic misunderstanding of how it actually works.
---
If you lack basic understanding of game mechanics, and make suicidal fitting decisions, sure you’re going to get dunked. But don’t extrapolate that to some fantasy that the gankers are all-powerful. The people with actual extensive experience on both sides know this is simply not true.
---
Test alliance attempting to blue the last part of eve (circa 2019)
---
this is some retarded ass meme shit vily. even for you
---
So many angry posts already lmao
---
the lore of capsuleers and how far ahead of regular people is kinda cyberpunk but told from the other side - we're the unfathomably rich, 'near-godlike because of technology' assholes that every cyberpunk story is about tearing down
---
this has zero impact on the actual gameplay of course, but in the lore it's definitely there
---
Restoring local after nullseccers chose to scream and cry rather than HTFU clearly shows that CCP have given up on HTFU.

a post in which Vily begins bluetralling the other 50% of eve 2019 colourised
---
I was in TEST for 2 years and know Vily to be a just and fair minded leader.
---
He's just trying to not create an absolute wasteland and crush a lot of small corps, etc.
---
If it turned out to be an area like Tribute/Vale it would be good for content and the game.
---
The real question is can Legacy actually do it.
---
Alarm clocking to bash Raitarus isn't content.
---
Stop roleplaying.

Posting ultimatums about in game politics *is* content

OOOOooooOOooOo...ooooOOooooo Oh yes.

Panda's aren't extinct yet. Soon you'll only be able to see them in the PanFam Zoo. In their natural habitat, of course.
---
In a system with alts (or friends) something like this will always be gamed by using a neutral alt to get fake kills.
---
It's not hard to understand, the new player experience and tutorials have always been shit. Believe it or not, it's better now than it was in the beginning. Only slightly though.
---
YEAH BECAUSE THIS IS AN ACTUAL SPACE WARFARE SITUATION WITH MILLIONS OF LIVES AND BILLIONS OF ISK ON THE LINE!
---
posting in a spice thread
---
[Probably the same way your buddy penifSMASH aims a lance.](http://i.imgur.com/nh2KwhZ.png)
---
&gt; Of course there is consequences of loosing a system, you'll have to move your assets to elsewhere or leave the militia
---
Except you don't because there's Upwell structures everywhere.
---
I, too, am colorblind, can't distinguish blue from white and have a difficult time reading.
---
TEST ALLIANCE PLEASE BLUE strikes again
---
Im ok with either outcome
---
Honest question? Why are you so bad?
---
You can run a abyssal site in a frigate, however you need to 1. Form a fleet with yourself and with whoever you'll be running the site with (up to 3 frigates) and 2. You need 3 of the same filament that you wish to run. 
---
When you want to run a filament, right click on your 3 stacked filaments, click use like you normally would, then click "activate for fleet". Then you can use the filament it makes in space like a gate, and you'll go in :)
---
To some people they are. And if they arent contested it's just going to be drop a carrier or something on it and say gg
---
I know there is ton of very talented IT guys who play EVE and they create lots of apps or 3rd party tools. What I mean is that is not an ingame "skill". 
---
Learning how to recruit/lead people is a skill you learn ingame, but you can´t learn coding ingame. ;)
---
Is this generous offer open to the newest member of the Winter Coalition - Pandemic Legion? We have no honoure to retain, hmu.
---
Why even post this vily, when u can have fights...be happy for that !!! We still are still waiting for GOTG to grow some...
---
this is a quality shit post.. didnt think you had one in you
---
Hey idiot, how am I supposed to read it then? Are you not bluetral to Provi or what?
---
Did all the talking in third person fry your brain?
---
That's why they have to be exterminated before they can get it up and running again, the loss of bot income has clearly killed FRT's SRP and morale.  It's been pretty obvious over the last couple months.
---
No salt tho, already enough in this thread
---
Can i get list of another "neutral" entity? Osmon homeless maybe?
---
Isnt tapi take all their station year ago, after pl tryed to kill provi? You think it enough neutral?
---
Bruh, 2 alliance that operate at polar timezones isn’t great content, I think everyone here can agree
---
Welcome to the cancer that is CCP's sov mechanics.  And then people wonder why people would rather blue than fight.
---
no, we arent. we ignore providence. BOTH sides of it.
---
FW suggestions:
---
- Remove the missions. All they're used for is LP farming by people playing the tiers and sniping the trigger ship. FW should be about PVP, not mission running. (You can leave the agents, just make them not part of FW and not have their payouts tier based.)
---
- Change how the tiering affects payout - there's a huge incentive to switch sides to the winning side. I'd probably just remove the tiering altogether tbh. The price of LP will settle as appropriate to the amount given out.
---
- Pirates should go suspect if they enter a plex, so you don't lose sec status shooting them. (Lore: interfering with the CONCORD-mandated war zone)
---
- Disallow anchoring Upwell structures, or make it so you can't dock in any structure if the wrong side owns a system, whoever owns it. Citadels have completely destroyed the value of territory.
---
- Do something about dplexing, it's not fun and it's bottable. Tbh I'd just remove it and have systems dplex themselves at say 5% an hour
---
- Only allow oplexing within 2 jumps of a system you own, so there's a sense of a battle front and progress
---
What?! LOL... VINDI.. Botters... OMG I am laughing so hard.  
---
You probably think we're Chinese too.  
---
FML.. now that's comedy.
---
TO THE GERMAN COMMANDER
---
The possibily to kill a ratting carrier is nice but:
---
You are solo/small group capital users. 
---
Want to move throught lowsec/populated nulls for an ops? Get ready to play feed-a-recon roulette every midpoint. 
---
Want to hunt or counterplay a skilled, reasonably risk-averse hunter? Everybody and his dog will check your /reset/group/833/ zkillboard state and dock up/form a hyperdunk composition once they suspect you a little, especially in lowsec.
---
People are able to use expensive toys to kill everything they can catch in their area with pretty much zero risk now and this is meh.
---
Low key admits Legacy can't hold that space either, want those FRT allies to switch sides anyway.
---
That is some Kissinger-level diplomacy right there.
---

Do you think he's seen how many structures FRT have in Detorid?
---
inb4 all feedback is ignored
---
a learned tapi :D
---
Only if you French me in front of your friends
---
&gt; Even if not, as soon as they aggress, they are freely attackable.
---
Attacking them is a token gesture at best. Their death is a forgone conclusion.
---
&gt;You seem to have this defeatist attitude... 15 seconds is forever if you’re paying attention.
---
You still seem to have this misunderstanding that i'm a hisec miner upset about ganking. I'm not i live in a wormhole and have never been ganked once in hisec my entire career.
---
And it was my understanding that -7 was where you were freely attackable anywhere in hisec and -10 was you were not allowed in hisec anymore and had to recover yourself a bit or you'd be shot on sight by faction police or concord or something.
---
Again tho i'm not upset about ganking. Gank to your heart's content i do not give a singular fuck. I'm upset with your misrepresentation of what you can do to avoid ganking as "fighting back."
---
Makes sense - test blues all of eve, but still thinks they're neutral despite never invading and having a safe word between FCs for when it gets one side gets too rough with the other.
---
What sort of cringe posting is this
---
lmao both sides calling each other out for blue'ing too many entities.
---
Yet we all know if this comes down to a KS fight, both sides are gonna use the batphone to all their blues.
---
Of course we have, we're in their space all day every day. Don't be a mouthbreather.
---
Funny seeing as I've seen you reference you were part of tri at some point in time,  how did tri work out again?  panfam pets in the drones is it?  The former DRF is doing far better than tri now. :P

How can anyone read it another way coming from TAPI.

how far has roleplaying fallen

Test is even trying to blue their last enemy now, inspirational.

haha yeah. Just like how b0t was neutral to PL for so many years! We just didn’t invade them because of all the epic content at our doorsteps. But we could have!!! Smiley Face :)
---
Your SALT feeds us. Keep feeding FRT
---
hey guys i'm the leader of the second biggest alliance in the game who is blue to the biggest alliance in the game but we are still looking for more blues so come on over
---
:)
---
I'm still waiting for the day when Gobbins unblues PL. It's coming.
---
im saying we dont have ANY agreements with provi.
---
ok
---
Take two freighters and they won’t know which one to alpha first
---
Man I miss these types of posts!
---
An EXTREMELY rare occurrence.
---
I dont see anything about an offer to blue anyone. Just a statement they would be treated like a provi alliance. We kill them all time
---
 Un-packaged (and undamaged) items can now be sold without any need to  repackage them first. Doing so will automatically repackage the item. In  the case of non-empty ships or containers you will receive a  confirmation message. 
---
Based on spaghetti code and loooong living statement of impossibility doing exactly this, i wonder how much time did developers burn in this little thing.
---
And know tapi want to blue more alliances lmao
---
Ok this should be embarrassing for every legacy member out there lol
---
hi u ok
---
So you don't want to blue up Fraternity itself? That sounds strange coming from TEST.

Classic TAPI reply. A slight variant on the “lol u mad??”

too bad you weren’t fun enough to actually grow DNG. if it makes you feel better, I did point to you for many years as an example of what not to do to grow your corporation - you probably helped a dozen CEOs turn their Corp into successes! :)
---
That's more like Imperium + TEST, they're not allies!!
---
There is no real good answer to this. Maybe he knows that the last real enemy and fight this game has left is the one against The Imperium and TAPI needs as many allies as possible beforehand.
---
I dunno, shitposting against the Chinese kinda feels pointless, almost like you're barking in vacuum space. It's not exactly that you can expect a wall of dank counter-memes in Mandarin to spice up the trash-talking.

true, maybe vily is just seeing the long game!

sadly I think the only fc in test with that capacity is PGL and he’s afk.

While I appreciate your enthusiasm your history is wrong. As DnG drifted from what we were I started my own corp that grew quite well. What I found after herding 100+ cats for a few months is that space leadership sucks and Eve is terrible when other people depend on you for fun and I walked away and let it die. 
---
But that's not what I meant anyway, I just meant in general. Like have you ever just looked out the window and listened to the birds? Take a walk with no agenda? Drink plenty of water and get a good night's rest? The world is your canvas, why not paint a little sunshine?

Here's the thing I think you're missing with an example 3km AoE turret: Four battleships shooting flak to drive off 8-12 frigates is fine. Even at say, 200DPS/1200 alpha.
---
250 Battleships firing at an anchored fleet is now a _300,000_ damage alpha. To each ship. Command Dessies Instantly Die. Cruisers Instantly Die. BCs Instantly Die. Other BSes _might_ survive. You would N+1/F1 **so much** harder that subcap doctrines become "Alarm clock and be on grid 12 hours early." Anything else feeds.

Defense fleet rarely get the intell at the last moment and reship into a counter setup while being able to use heavy assets.

I don't see why the hell responce fleets need more buff.

 Carrier is cheaper when you adjust for insurance. Also due to low buffer relative to cost incursion ships are very vulnerable to tanking especially logi.

I do enjoy clubbing seals. Please come again
---
Provi Won the last time so i guess its a step up.
---
WOW, should rename TAPI to "The Blue Man Group"
---
Oh those Ferrari boys
---
I don't know to explain this more clearly living in lowsec isn't profitable for the fast majority of people doing it they make their money outside of there own space, remove capitals and this still applies LS is alt heavy income low and pvp heavy it's a horrible environment for new corps to try and grow in.
---
Now in your day to day life in LS carriers really are not that common unless it's over a citadel or a bridging titan here or there. 
---
But you might well say but removing them has no cost and that's the biggest wrong, it's to only space for a non-sov carrier to be staged really as you can't be camped into the station ( unlikely with NPC null where you can be camped in and are just screwed ), this would lead to less and less carrier and fax pilots in k-space that is not aligned with a big bloc, along with making moving out of your bloc as a carrier pilot basically impossible ( without just selling it ), keep in mind the same applies to titans/supers and given there production is limited to sov null already it is gonna massively hurt supply for people again that are not in a big bloc.
---
Yes, we have too many of all of them I would absolutely agree but right now the balance of power between big null blocs and everyone else is already massively in favor of big null coalitions making this worse in favor of making space that isn't all that great to live in still shit but more accessible seems like a terrible trade to me.
---
&gt; ganking explicitly has no counterplay
---
This seems to be a common misconception in this thread, anyone who's actually done it knows how wrong this is.

Ganking has no counterplay *if* you can't be bothered playing the game and want to afk in max-yield fits in 0.5. Nor should it have counters under those circumstances - you're basically botting at that point.

But the question becomes why would you want to? Everyone says "neutral" doesn't mean neutral but the only time they consider it actually neutral is when you're willing to invade the other guy. But why the fuck would I want to do that when I have plenty of space and get everything I need from right where I am? The only answer to that is bad blood, which he said they don't have against the little guys, just frat and elo basically.

Expanding on this suggestion, I would change the capabilities of each rat to match what the ship they're using is actually like and bonused for, and shuffle their names to indicate what you can expect from them like the Triglavian ships; no more EWAR or logistics ships flying at you guns blazing, they're going to hang back and support their fleet. I'll use the Serpentis frigate rats as an example of what I'm talking about:
---
Name | Ship | Fit | Details
---
---------|----------|----------|---------
---
Initiate | Velator | Railguns, drones, sensor dampeners, and armor repairer | Newly-initiated Serpentis captains and crewmen get assigned to these ships, and they'll keep at range so they can shoot you with their railguns while their scramblers (hopefully) keep you from locking them and their pair of Hobgoblins harass you.
---
Agent | Daredevil | Blasters, stasis web, afterburner | One of the most dangerous frigates the Serpentis have, this ship is meant to get in close alongside its buddies, web you, and then melt you.
---
Defender | Incursus | Blasters, microwarpdrive, armor repairer | Brawler that gets in close to its target as quickly as possible and then orbits.
---
Novitiate | Violator | Blasters, stasis web, afterburner, armor repairer | The aggressive, close-range counterpart to the Initiate, these ships will get in close using their afterburner, then orbit you as close as possible to take advantage of their fit's tackling abilities and blaster DPS.
---
Safeguard | Maulus | Railguns, sensor dampeners | Stays at a distance to scramble the sensors of enemy ships and shoot them with railguns. Simple, but effective.
---
Patroller | Atron | Blasters, stasis webifier, warp scrambler, microwarpdrive | Found in sites, these guys charge in close to scramble and web you.
---
Partisan | Tristan | Railguns, many drones, afterburner, warp disruptor | Kiting Tristan that keeps at a distance, using five Hobgoblins to harass the enemy and the disruptor to prevent them from escaping.
---
Protector | Tristan | Blasters, drones, afterburner | Brawler Tristan that gets in close to fight alongside its Hobgoblins.
---
Scout | Atron | Blasters, afterburner, stasis webifier, warp disruptor, warp scrambler | Found as part of roaming squadrons, these ships are opportunistic and will tackle anything that looks worth the fight so their buddies have an easier time killing it. They will also call in reinforcements
---
Spy | Imicus | Expanded probe launcher, EWAR drones | This ship is something you will encounter in every system in Serpentis space and more rarely in other areas where they operate, like Outer Ring and Syndicate. They stay in safe zones and periodically scan the system with combat probes. If they see a juicy target (or someone with really low Serpentis standing) they'll try to scan the ship down for an allied fleet to hit it. If *you* scan it down and manage to kill it before it warps off, you'll find a lot of valuable data in their hold that you can give to the Serpentis Corporation's enemies, like CONCORD, the Gallente, or Mordu's Legion.
---
Watchman | Incursus | Railguns, afterburner, armor repairer | A kiting Incursus, this ship will orbit its target at range.
---
Warden | Navitas | Remote armor repairer |  Renamed from "Guard" so the "Guardian" prefix doesn't make it sound silly. Stays near the back of the group and tries to repair ships that take damage.
---
Avenger | Virtuoso | Covert ops cloak, railgun, torpedoes, bomb launcher, warp disruptor, sensor dampener, target painter, covert cynosural field generator | These guys are special rats that you will only see if you *really* piss the Serpentis Corporation off (-10 standing), with an increased chance of spawning the closer you get to Serpentis Prime. Depending on what you're flying at the time, you may be ambushed by as many as seven Avengers at once, and if you're in a capital ship they'll light a cynosural field to call in a support fleet.
---
The rats should also drop modules that depend on what their ship would be fit with and what prefix/level they are. Again, I'll use the Serpentis as an example.
---
Prefix | Tier | Capabilities
---
---------|----------|----------
---
N/A | Regular | Use Gallente ships; T1 hulls, ammunition, and modules. "Chief" variants use meta modules.
---
Guardian | Veteran | Members of the Guardian Angels, they're uncommon enemies unless you're hitting a mid-high level site, where they'll be the norm. T1 Gallente and Serpentis faction hulls. Modules are the best T1/Meta available and some of the more common T2 modules. "Chief" variants will use Serpentis faction hulls exclusively, Guardian faction modules, and Shadow Serpentis ammunition.
---
Shadow | Elite | The best ships and crews in the Serpentis Corporation, rare but powerful. They use T2 and Serpentis faction hulls. They fit T2 modules and use either Shadow or T2 ammunition, depending on their role. "Chief" variants will use Shadow Serpentis modules.
---
Please let me know what you think of my idea!
---
this is funny....you killed a few ihubs outside of Chinese TZ, reffed structures...outside of Chinese TZ and here you are claiming victory but refuse to fight the Chinese on their prime time when they are formed at 100% full force....
---
Not much different than NC showing up to Frat timers, honestly.
---
Keepstars are cheap though. There is no reason to fight over them.
---
But why fight if victory is not certain?
---
Maybe keep them from showing up on local if they're cloaked?
---
Did the goons approve of this search for additional grand-children?
---
They got a nerf. It's called Cyno Changes :(
---
Maybe CCP could find some middle ground. It's clearly too "easy" to drop a cyno and teleport a fleet, and it's far too abused.
---
reported enjoy ur ban
---
Lol keep drinking the Kool aid
---
Threaten them with ships, that's fine.  Tell them you're bringing The Little Astra That Could along...  That would be war crimes level shit.
---
I mean.. Test were able to kill a winterco fort in there stageing in China prime today but winter was unable to kill the same thing on the same day in there own stageing in late EU
---
Lmao, don't think its possible to come off as more of a whingy little bitch than this.

I feel like everyone should just blue the goons. I'm cool with going AFK for 6 months while these Eve politicians argue over the different shades of blue. Maybe then their member base will realize they weren't true "leaders". Instead, corpses with no backbone.
---
Panda hibernation season is coming. get ready to go sleep pandas.
---
Do you want something with that salt?
---
Agree with the specifics of some of these, disagree with others. My main point here should be that they should undertake a holistic reassessment of FW mechanics to see what works and what doesn't.  Then whatever changes they come up with, they should consider having a few major / unique events a year that offer FW players a sense that their participation has lasting impact within the EVE setting.
---
The frigate version is a bit more fun anyway, imo. Clearing sites is pretty demanding at T3+ (or at least unforgiving of mistakes), and you get triple the drops from a given site.
---
If your idea of "not stagnant" is shooting undefended structures for a month then I don't know what to say.
---
Good bee, you get more honey.
---
It's not that hard to field a counter to a fleet that's showing from your staging system like you have you full doctrine pool to reship in the hostiles have shown a fleet already and are unlikely to be able to reship.
---
Anymore that might be a little high given the stagnation
---
No, but he did.
---
Yeah it like all those diablo style mobile mmorpgs, basically clones of diablo, WoW and other big games. It's kind of nice to play since my PC took a crap on my but yeah I opened it up today and was like EVE is that you lol
---
live for the salt
---
I have literally joined the smaller entity in almost every major eve war. I prefer content to blobing.
---
Legion skins.  There are only three.
---

---
orange and black
---
Tengu has 10 skins.  CCP be all like pfft nobody flies X ship so why bother making skins for it.  Anybody else would be like hey nobody flies this ship maybe something is wrong with it.
---
Exactly! At its best, this is what FW does for the game. I've spent nearly a decade in FW, and in that time I've seen a pattern of brand new players recruited into my corp who learn to love pvp.  Some stay, some move on to other things. On many occasions I've seen those folks go on to become FCs / content creators elsewhere in the game, whether its with their own lowec pvp corps or even in the major null blocs.
---
Space ships is a serious business ok. Blowing up ships is fun but talking on discord about not blowing up ships. That shit right there is the good good ok. Dont get it mistaken.
---
Who you fly with does not define you as a pilot. That sort of sentiment would really ruin this game, oh wait..
---
Not winning fast enough?
---
ko ?
---
I'm not free riding, of you read the post,  you'll see that I'm an FC and did a lot to try to make content. 
---
I also revealed what percent of the fleets I attend actually see content.
---
Eves ui can basically be controlled on a mobile device, it's not like other mmos where you need 5 toolbars and hotkeys to do the basic functions. It would be nice to see a mobile version of Eve but I dont think many generic devices could run it.
---
Feel free to link a few that had quite this level of ass pain
---
"TEST" you forgetting to include The Imperium and FIRE coalition in there, also dont just say "TEST" when Legacy as a whole has been forming for their fleets, give credit where credit is due, us Brave Noobs are tired of going on TEST fleets and not even get a thank you cuz "TEST" is doing it all alone
---
it's not even that they would ignore feedback, it's the equivalent of putting a patch on a bleeding knee of a patient with a heart attack, I mean sure you kind of helped but he's dead anyway if you don't do something about it...
---
Probably legacy design when carriers could use drones.
---
Yeah. As well as offering perfect safety to krabs, which denies roaming content, it also offers perfect intel to larger fleets, and that means both sides know who has the better fleet. Unless the losing FC is really bored he's not going to take a fight he knows he will lose.
---
"doesnt count cause i said so lol"
---
I was thinking something along the lines of a 500m AoE turret that when fit in, say, 7 high slots with perfect skills, does \~400dps/800alpha. If the centre of the AoE is a randomized distance from the target (say up to 3km), the chance of hitting the same ship repeatedly is low unless the target is very large, but the DPS is too low to be effective against large targets, meaning its effectiveness is limited to hitting blobs/anchored fleets. Dropping a ton of flak-fit battleships on an enemy would be pointless, since they lack the alpha and DPS for mainline combat and could be countered by the opponent bringing their own regularly-fit battleships into play, and the number of battleships required to reliably hit a single target makes their spammability limited. An enemy faced with a large number of flak battleships could merely scatter to where each ship is greater than 3.5km from another, avoiding all of the DPS. Flak should be something that can be easily handled by logi when shooting anything bigger than a destroyer, while logi can happily sit outside of the flak's range. Flak should only be effective by overwhelming logi by splitting DPS evenly across a large number of grouped smaller ships, which can't individually handle the dps.
---
With a flak weapon like this, I really can't imagine it being practical to have more than two flak-fit battleships in a 30man BS fleet. It would be too specialized of a counter to spam.
---
You can't win deploying test to detorid the same way you failed in 2015. So instead you are just gonna try pick off their low hanging fruit. I thought you knew tbis gsme but 2 for 2 thats gotta suck.

On behalf of all my fellow straight up chill logibros I gladly accept this honour and the large and generous monetary reward that accompanies it.

I found the delicious point where bitterness burns right through your tongue and turns into sweetness in these comments. gj reddit
---
cringe posting over a cringe post lol
---
Remember everyone, Vily is allowing you all to work with Snuffed Out, as they are not on the naughty list!
---
lol u scurred
---
dude...
---
:blink:
---
This. I don't get the hate.
---
scurred people join goons and tapi because they're afraid if they did anything else they can't mine.
---
This flair can yield amazing things... :)
---
Yes and it wasn't for the reason you said.  Rise specifically said it was so that they could adjust the stats on a ship as another knob for balancing cynos rather than having to balance the cyno modules itself across a vast amount of ships varying from noob ships to titans.  This would still pretty be in-line that goal, that's 18 ships all the same hull size, 5 of which are logi.  If that's too much they could even reduce it to the t1 ewar cruisers which would bring it to 4.
---
LOL now you edit your post and still have wrong information... LORDE botters... lemme guess, you think they are Chinese too?  
---
Get outta here.. lol  
---
Bro, do you even eve?
---
I'm imagining it... but that part about them not getting evicted but being neutral standings is really breaking my immersion. 2/7 experience, going back to Beat Saber.
---
Man, torvald you’re mining some serious salt in this post. Haters gonna hate... keep up the great content. It’s dudes like you who are going to help get proving conduits to spawn in USTZ.
---
Right. And this is part of the cyno changes that affects wolfpacks that you didn't say boo about. Hence my original comment.
---
Wtf kind of wolfpack is killing supers and titan anyways? It's called a wolfpack for a reason. Wolfpacks kill caribou and shit, not goddamn triceratops and brontosaurus.
---
I've never seen so many people so upset about us taking ihubs and sov and killing things in a spaceship game.
---
I think it should be impossible to warp into deadspace sites even if you scan down the ship(s) running it; the ganker has to use the acceleration gate just like everybody else. Being able to warp directly to a room without using a gate violates the lore and discourages players from running those sites in low and null.
---
Also, the more I hear about EvE gankers, the more I think that they're less "content creators" and more "content deniers". Does anyone else get that impression or is it just me?
---
nice thing about a 160 km mark is that you can use that and the station model as a reference to get more out from there ( warp a 100 from it put the BM over the station undock bm ) test repeat, especially useful if you making undocks in space that isn't high-sec, as you can do the process mostly cloaked.
---
Yup, added that to my list.
---
you are really mad at this man, calm down
---
Is it not a fact that NCdock has shown up to a few FRT ihub timers?
---
TAPI's victim mentality is low-key impressive.
---
Sounds like you need to get out of a lame nullsec Corp and join FW or wormhole life. 
---
Nullsec is just for stupid role playing losers to get their boss people around fix.
---
I've seen gankers describe themselves as "content creators", but the behavior you're describing sounds more like the people who would do that are content *deniers*. Is anyone else getting that impression?
---
Is it surprising that HTFU is brought up by people complaining about changes because the majority of updates by CCP are on a trajectory of pandering to a playerbase insistent on safety?
---
(No, its not)
---
So it wouldn't be a deep safe if you could end up on someone's scan that is warping between celestials
---
WHY AREN'T LOGIS ON BATTLEREPORTS YET?!
---
why are people like you so upset that we're taking ihubs and sov from FRT and destroying their space things?
---
All your blues fit tethered one citadel thanks to genius design decisions.
---
mfw globby is goodposting at the newbros -- wait no globby was always goodposting wtf
---
Brave didnt took anything, it was given to them by those Russians that left... Brave couldnt hold shit against that 20 man group that went there and wreck their shit and took the systems for frat

Serious question to anyone in Winter Co. who isn't in Fraternity. What are you all gonna do when Frat fucks off to the sov they already have in Oasa and Perrigen Falls? They already have their exit plan in place. How long do you think you have until they hang you all out to dry?
---
They haven't found out after years of the same, why would another 6mo change things?
---
You can take their ihubs and tcus but you dont have to blue them after. Also this was a jab at vily because he called me a "supporter of bots" for being on the winterco side last week. Now he wants to take in the botters into his sphere influence and doesnt actually care about destroying them lol.
---
Good thing CCP also agrees that Null should have no conflict drivers.
---
What happens after a war is mostly won? I mean...PL would burn someone out of their space and rent it but that kinda lead to the eternal TEST/brave grudge and where we stand now.
---
Preserve some smaller actors, hope they grow big and leave a neutral entity bordering your regions...seems like a coherent strategy.
---
I mean if TEST does burn out every last alliance, instills someone or rents then what? Sounds like too much work to me.
---
"Nuetral"

That's cute.

this is the real travesty right here...
---
Imagine having a grade 2 reading comprehension.
---
Shark prince! Ooh Ha Ha !
---
Lol test can’t win the war and even if all the sov dropped today they’d  keep it about as long as they can stay erect
---
They are part of a balanced ecosystem  of content.
---
It's a sandbox mate. Newsflash: !&gt;not everybody cares to circlejerk to pvp content.!&lt;
---
I'd love to take credit for that but I cant.
---
I will always hunt you. In a wormhole probably. Better this than be a pet of legacy. (Bluetral) you may call it. I'm no pet. I'm your enemy
---
When you actually miss that the whole point of the post is that the war test started to kill botting now they are accepting surrender from bots and for them to keep their space. Nice!
---
Not really. He doesn't address the reasons immediately. One of the reasons is they wanted to break up the umbrella beacuse of the isk faucet. This is at 11 mins or so.
---
&gt;This would still pretty be in-line that goal,
---
No. Cheap cruisers would be disposable and nothing would change, which is what you are after. You want the isk of null sec with the safety of high sec.
---
I/We have no stake in this war, so no ass pain here mate. Just taking the piss.
---
There was a point? Guess I did miss it.
---
Wasnt Vily crying to Snuff after they dropped on TEST titans and calling him a faggot and shit?? I mean that burst of anger like a little girl was pretty funny
---
reading is hard...
---
Ya thats where actual reading comprehension comes lmao but hey you listen to what dady villy says. Wont be long before the game is dead.
---
Ya dw they are "nuetral"
---
Wormholes... jajajjajahahahahahahaaa
---
PanFam will protect them.
---
Get a AMD Ryzen and you will notice a massive performance increase in all functions. Also get a m.2 NVMe ssd in order to maximize on this.
---
This has always been Vily's strategy though, the entire idea of fighting something his own size terrifies him and always has.  If you notice every time some 2000 man alliance attacks him he paints this 'ALL OF EVE' narrative and blues 3 or 4 more things up to shore up his defenses.  He was a cuck when he was in Goons, he's a cuck now, the only difference between now and then is the amount of coke he does.
---
k bro, glhf
---
And TEST.
---
Fuck I love Grath
---
Is that what happened to Fleet-Up?
---
Honestly what would be nice is test blues winterco and we all hit imperium. Will that happen? No. At this point there's alot of bad blood and vily doesn't have the balls to oppose imperium.
---
What are you able to run t4s in (or are you not running t4s)?  
---
I'm trying to gauge the risk of running abyssal sites as a way to make some occasional ISK for ships/fits.  Have been going back and forth as to whether I should skip FW altogether and engage people as I please in lowsec.  Sort of leaning to the latter as PVP is what I'm after.  I thought FW might be a good way to make ISK and PVP but it seems the hunting isn't always productive once you join a militia (according to recent comments I've read anyway).
---
No such thing as too much salt
---
good work guys i'm sure you'll really enjoy the game when half the map is officially blued. :O
---
You *are* a supporter of bots.

amd ryzen 7 pro 2700u and u will  feel power
---
My doctor seems to disagree
---
I'm not completely incompetent at logi and I keep whatever T1 logi cruisers (and Deacons) might be necessary on-hand in case the usual logi people aren't around, but I prefer being on killmails. The other guys are appreciated, though.
---
Well said, Vily will always have a victim complex.
---
It was vily who said faggot. But my point was the snuff box Corp has had nothing to with the alliance snuffed out for years.
---
It's just anti-dino stuff. All ills in eve are dino/goon.
---
IDK if you wanna get hit with that paintbrush, but everyone legacy side knows Brave and all allies are good buddies.
---
Thank god he's afk. Gives us a break from listening to him slap his gums together while eating gumbo... "WHAT THE FUCK YOU STUPID FUCKING DICKLESS INTERCEPTOR, I HOPE YOU FUCKING DIE".
---
😋
---
Pretty sure this war was started because we wanted to pew pew, but sure, let's not ruin your narrative.
---
Do you listen to your own firesides?
---
We also go help provi with objectives on a fairly regular basis whether or not anyone besides the local LS groups is actually there on the other side of the fight.
---
Not my narrative if vily said it to me in local
---
So in the end all of null is fully PvE except for people not living in this part of space? :thinking:
---
I can't even read through this mush. Why can't we just play a spaceship game and pew pew each other? I don't give a rats arse about whatever shit this is.
---
Change the reinforcement from the TZ to something similar to the old Stront fuel Timers that a POS has. (maybe giving a small bay for shield timer and a larger bay for armor timer) Once the shield is below 50% the shield bay could not be touched. The same for Armor. I remember hitting a POS to just below 50% but not RFing it till later to have the timer come out more in our favor.

riiiiiiiight like Evictus not falling apart, Requiem following them steps or breaking and Tickle MIA but they are all "good buddies" that if  they dont join TEST pings they get repercussions lol
---
If you guys enjoy wh space, move there. You will find fights, not every day, but theyre there if you look hard enough.

The great thing about a sandbox is you can play it how you want. Sorry kid that Vily isn't playing it a way you choose.

Frenemy: Short for friend-enemy. It's someone you like to fight with, but when the chips are down you'll defend them.
---
Blue: When you set standings, for personal contacts, corp contacts, or alliance contacts, you can set different levels. These levels control the color of icons in your overview. The defaults available are -10 (red), -5 (orange), 0 (gray), +5 (light blue), and +10 (dark blue). "Blues" are the people that you or your group have set positive standings toward, but who aren't in your corp (green) or in your fleet (purple). Most groups use a "not blue -- shoot it" policy, so blue (or green or purple) are their space friends and everyone else is presumed hostile.
---
Pet: A pejorative term. Group A is a pet of group B if they're blue to each-other and the speaker doesn't think group A brings anything of value to the relationship. Means the speaker thinks group A is weak, small, or both.
---
*RuneScape* makes bonds untradeable upon being sold to another player, but with the possibility of making it tradeable again by spending a portion (I believe a tenth) of its value.
