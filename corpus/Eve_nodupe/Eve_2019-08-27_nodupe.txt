If I was Rise or Fozzie I'd already have this shitstain on block.

[Purging intensifies]
---
any major bloc who **wants** to come help
---
the difference between gating for 45+ minutes vs 5-10 minutes with a wormhole in the mix can be significant in entities wanting to help, it can be the difference between not knowing if you are going to get blue balled vs a guaranteed fight.
---
strategic objectives vs opportunistic objectives
---
I get your point but its not like its a collective conscious making decisions together. More likely when people are fine with something they don't say much, but the ones who are upset are the ones that come to complain.
---
Its true that someone is probably going to be displeased with whatever they do, but I doubt its the same people making an uproar in every case.
---
&gt; That isn't stifling the ecosystem, it's growing it
---
Thats growing YOUR ecosystem at the expense of the entire rest of the game.
---
Theres nothing I'm going to say to convince you of that fact and you're incapable of seeing your personal bias adjusting your attitude but at the point things currently are at, you're an oppressive force in the game by sheer bulk.  
---
The large groups aren't fighting each other because the outcomes are already decided, and the large groups make it relatively impossible for any smaller groups to form without the 'permission' of the larger groups.
---
Tears? What are you talking about? Are you ok? Like do you need help?

They must be in the camp that likes grindy games like PoE or something. The lot of em are masochists. Or rather, they think we're masochists, because I seriously doubt any of them actually PLAY the game other than in testing or dicking about.
---
You understand that there are plenty of WH entities that focus almost entirely on PVP in J-space, right? Equating some WH entities that fail at whaling with a failure of an entire area of space failing to adapt is horse shit, but then again I'm pretty sure you know that.
---
Eve is dying cause the players that have stuck around are literal cancer, new players leave because of this, while older players inevitably move on to other things simply because eve just isn't that entertaining anymore
---
Lol! I have to earn my way this time though I appreciate it. I paid my way before I took a hiatus. $1100 later and I’m barely at a point where I have a stable enough income to *consider* flying pvp ships for pvp. Lately I’m using them to make mission running easier. I’m the worst, I realize this.
---
lessee... grind rocks or grind psychotic pygmy fish people for hours on end... choices choices

Ask for your money back.
---
*Flagging will continue until morale improves*
---
I think they'd be broken.  Also, not CCPs fault that people jumped the gun and injected into shit before things were set in stone.
---
I dont know CAS runs small gangs and seems to kill quite a bit of init just fine even with the supers init likes to undock
---
Lol, too funny. Keep going please.
---
Great post!
---
I will be able to tell my children's children that I saw the beginning of the end for EVE, they'll ask when was that, and I'll reply 2008.

Umm, they are called corvettes now. Get with times man!

Duude just perfect

---
That time when i scanned a 2 wh jump route through my static to get a cap home. As my scout was approching the first WH, with cap ready to undock and warp on WH after a few cynos, i hear the WH activate...  just a Chim collapsing in my face... CURSE YOU BOB!!!!
---
Server.
---
Let put it in that way:
---
Those entitys that Focus on pvp in j Space dont go to reddit every other Day and cry about umbrellas.
---
So if any of those guys feel offended then im honestley sorry guys but youve seen yourself whats going on out here.
---
Indeed i was aiming at those who try to whale in null and fail horribly. And in at least 60% of those cases its a Case of "didnt prepare properly and failed but it must be the other sides fault"
---
And now CCP is listening to those and just runs down the game by any metric we as players have
---
Now every "trololol these are just bots" heats up but you guys can go straight back to pit you came from since its Not all bots in reality there 8s a whole lot Veteran players unsubbing as they are tired of puting with this shit while the Real issues get totally ignored.
---
I just spent an hour reading through all of these replies and all the complaints can be summed up by either "this is a tedious pain in the ass" or "lmao this is dumb"
---
If y'all remember correctly, this game isn't supposed to be easy
---
It isn't CCP's job to make things easier for you or to coddle you as you jump through space
---
If anything, throwing a wrench in your gears every now and then is good for the game
---
And honestly, making JF's more dangerous to use is GREAT  for the game
---
No activity should ever be 100% safe here
---
That's the point of EVE

I've legit been enjoying it.
---
And if you stop paying over $130 per year, you cannot use skill points that fall into the Omega area, cannot fly a large number of ships, etc.
---
I kind of agree with most of this post, although admittedly I haven't played EVE in a long time. 
---
I've been watching this Chaos era from the outside for a while, and while it's been fairly interesting, this latest change to cynos really just gives me the impression that they're flipping switches on and off in the hopes that it reboots the game. What EVE's been lacking for a good long while has been, essentially, a vision for how to move forward into the future. 
---
Like... maybe farming the same null sec system eventually depletes complexes and materials. Maybe the only way to get more of them is by jumping to unconnected rogue systems and holding them long enough to bring in the bigger ships needed to properly harvest the wealth of the system.
---
Accessibility is big problem too, but I'm afraid that CCP keeps thinking that the way to solve this is through a computer system, like a better tutorial or something. Personally, I think the only solution is to ditch starter, NPC run corps and pay real live players ISK to run starter corps to help players get their bearings.

Don't worry once we drop below 0 then Eve will suddenly have 2,147,483,647 players.

just like ur mum

Hey, CCP, you might want to reconsider those cyno changes. 
---

Wait for patch notes next time if you're not okay with risking sp.
---
Player count isn't players online in nullsec. If those bots moved to highsec, then they're still being counted. If players leave nullsec and go to high/low/jove space, they're still counted. 
---
If highsec is 90% of the player base and the average has been around 30,000 online, then ~3,000 of those are in null. If the player count is down a few thousand due to null changes, then that means even a 1,500 player drop in nullsec at any given timezone is HUGE. That would be a 50% drop in nullsec population.

Shot in the dark here but how about CCP remove bounties from ratting and instead add bounties to pvp, you could scale it based on market values of ships/fits or whatever to prevent abuse. So you have an incentive to PVP solo or in fleets. Imagine if nobody could rat anymore and the main casual source of income was actual pvp. Imagine making isk every time you alpha off another muninn or pipebomb a whole fleet at once or better yet, pop a titan. Would kill botting as well, force them to move to mission running or whatever, gotta be a pain to programme that.
---
Combine it with player deaths (non-alliance, non-blue, valued by hull value and size) driving the security status down and we might have a workable dynamic security status system.  And Jita would likely go -1.0 the first day...
---
Ook ooo motherfucker
---
Haha, yep.
---
did you not hear? the decline is due to the gap between faucets and sinks. so when the game is taken off line, that gap will be gone and eve online will be perfect.
---
If you log off, then take a vacation in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic and enjoy a Blue Lagoon cocktail at the bar.
---
I paid 3 accounts with real money and i went to 1 account only. All other accounts were paid by plex. there is no reason to pay them too. that means i got from 11 to 1 omega account
---
"You mean the target"
---
It's so hard to kill unfitted alts in frigs, if all you want are killmarks.
---
Yes. But my goal is for them to run as long as possible. I light them before work and they will run all day due to the cargo space.
---
Aaaaannnnddd this is what drove me to quit EVE. Exactly this. Good Job CCP.
---
It really started taking off in 2016-2017.
---
&gt; and olmeca be here farming this dude
---
So your new player happens to be a Rorqual, super, or titan pilot?
---
&gt; In some of those wars fighting over moons played a substantial role.
---
Goons vs Bob had little to do with any in game resources
---
Halloween War was kicked off by Asakai, which was technically started over a moon, but not really.
---
WWB was started by Lenny because of his Casino getting robbed by SMA, and PL and Test wanting revenge on goons. Nothing to do with moons.
---
And obviously the war last summer had nothing to do with moons
---
So, I really don't think adding "content drivers" will help much
---
I mean you can only adapt the bots so much. People are finding workarounds easily enough, like just burning back to gate and jumping in again to glitch them out.
---
Since CCP Rise said he does read these types of threads, I’m going to risk commenting on a Reddit post just to say the following:
---
My close friends who I enjoyed playing in wormholes with and then in Null with, all left EVE not because it got boring or we got stomped or we didn’t have access to x y z. They all stopped playing because they got into the last year of college, or got a job, or a significant other, and couldn’t keep up the 3-5 hour time sink during a day to play. 
---
We loved what we did, and maybe we could have been more casual in the end when we realized we couldn’t go hard at eve for as many hours as we used to, but in the end we just fell away from the game because no one could find the time required. 
---
Please address the time needed to enjoy the game or get content or whatever you want to call it. I want to game with those nerds just one more time, riding into hell through a static, or bashing a structure that’s got defenders, or getting my shit kicked in by a C5 Drifter.
---
Please. :(
---
&gt; just like ur mum
---
What the
---
Totally agree. I also think it's the best way to introduce new players to PVP and fleet combat.
---
Because it’s CCP and they like to think they know their own game when they don’t
---
Mwd cloak trick, ive done dst runs to null before, aslong as there are no bubbles, your more than likely going to have no problem
---
If this game wasn't spreadsheet enough. Geez
---
Trying Wow and spawning into an Inn while to belfs RP their fetishes was a shock, finding out people RP in eve is more of a... "ok, cool" thing you never knew. Did not expect either.
---
Made a nice picture too.
---
Duck? Were you trying to be insulting? Overreacting much?
---
Ya that's why I mentioned pos spam
---
DOOM!!
---
So I agree with you that they cave in, but they don’t commit fully to what is being requested and will 100% of the time result in something broken. The CSM (you can check the minutes) have been requesting consistently for rorquals to be removed as a mining superiority and to take HAWs off Titans and as a result they only go 50% which just pisses all sides off.
---
This subreddit needs to be cleansed with indiscriminate walls of fire.
---
Have you not noticed the site is going through a major overhaul?
---
Shit is beta yo
---
Be patient.
---
and no I don't need full functionality to please you nerds :)
---
EFT's.
---
I would have no problem fund manager and milking those fees regardless of market performance.
---
Ah yes, it feels good to know that we are back to misrepresenting the point that the smallgang community tried to make by calling out the MER meta.  
---
But to reiterate for the billionth time: It is not about being able to kill capitals with small numbers, it is about having other stuff in space that it is engageable for a smallgang + the standard response to subcaps shouldn't be dropping capitals on them.  
---
It also shows how well you understood what the point was because you are conflating three distinct playergroups: wormholes, smallgang and bombers bar (which are the only true "whalers" in that list. and i think they are the best example for the ship balance being shit. If it requires 100 dudes+ to have any chance at scoring  kills other than vnis, the only other commonly available target at the time, i might as well not do it).
---
And it is ironic that you think that ccp is listening to pvpers for a change is bad considering how hard they tried to please anyone trying to farm isk in the last 3 years in null.  
---
Quitting the game is quite a severe reaction to such a small amount of adversity. It has been 2 months of blackout and you are already pulling out the nuke of quitting the game.  
---
Meanwhile you are completely ignorant to the large amount of people that quit the game over the last years because the pvp was so stagnant/pointless.
---
Yeah, Mr. Mong messes that up a bit but what he’s basically talking about is:
---
-	have scanning alt in system, within 14.3au of likely areas for deep safes
---
-	have probes out, move them as far away as possible, hit analyze to get them to warp, move them back to deep safe area but don’t hit analyze
---
-	wait for known cyno alt to show up on dscan
---
-	hit analyze; probes warp and (hopefully) get you a one-hit on the JF
---
A few counter-points to some parts:
---
F2P can eat a dick.  You spend 10x more in that model. Look at what plex and injectors are doing -- sure they get more money. Plex are not generated items so make money from the weirdos that grind ISK as a second job while the person buying plex dictates what they want to make from each plex.
---
However for many people that have stuck with the game for as long as we have, the sub is precisely what keeps us here.  I can pay 15 bucks (at max price) per month and my character improves whether or not I have to deal with my kiddo, wife, dog, the sky opens up and floods my house, etc.
---
F2P is \*always\* P2W. Except in EvE's case its F2P&lt;Subbed&lt;kids with parents' CC.  In all of these other games it's the same way.
---
And for some crazy ass reason, most of the kids nowadays seem to \*enjoy\* the grinding in these games. Look at HS care bears that piss away they're days mining/ratting to plex. Look at the PoE crowd -- hell the company is Grinding Gear Games, FFS. Or Warframe, which is stupidly popular after years.
---
I think they should go back to when 1 plex paid for a month sub, and completely fuck off with the free sp and injectors.  That was when we had the high numbers if you recall.  If they keep alphas that is kinda cool, and I think that they do keep content going.
---
I don't think you can (but I might be wrong). Evernus will retain your transaction history but you have to download it within that 90 days.
---
"F1 to pay respects" would have a new meaning.
---
Fully Automated Luxury Gay Space Communism belongs to everyone.
---
r/wallstreetbets would like to have a word with you
---
Calm down bro, you're gonna make Stainguy feel like he has competition for the r/EVE "Chimp of the Month" contest
---
I prefer the triple leverage inverse ETFs
---
I've seen three different explanations
---
* Solar sails, for added flight speed (explaining the Minmatar ships having the highest speed)
---
* Heat dissipation panels (because heat dissipation in space is pretty yikes)
---
* LADAR Antennae (Really doesn't feel like that's how antennae work, but I saw it in a blueprint for the Hurricane)
---
Great game, hard to keep the play time down though
---
Every time I went to war with PIRAT they docked up
---
Are we talking about the same group?
---
With adding content drivers i don't necessarily mean adding other types of ressources to the game. I am thinking more along the lines of changing the current ressource pool to one where scarcity is common and where you have to fight to have the right to harvesting ressources.  
---
Localising ressources more heavily would also help with this, as you'd either have to invade/pay extra to get what you need (while also giving groups the option to starve the market of their local commodity).  
---
This would ofcourse be quite a complex system, and to avoid that one group sits on the most valuable ressources for too long you'd have to shuffle it up regularly. Which in turn would mean groups have to become more mobile, which will reduce their size quite drastically.
---
you mean they have multiple servers.... it's like a baby game.
---
True. We are a force to be reckoned with; but we are neither indestructible nor undefeated. And we are not oppressive to the small fights and conflict in many area's of space such as Tribute, Vale, and most of low and wh.  
---
But your right, many of the large groups do not fight each other because we lack any reason even though we want too and elements such as Hilmar only making us ball up more.
---
Corp Por!
---
What are NPSI fleets?  How do I find them?
---
Yeah, I see that having numbers quickly reinforced will frustrate the opposing side.  Maybe it could have a back off or something?  Like, 1st time you die, you're only 1 system out, then 2, then 4, 8, etc. up to the max of where your medical clone is?  Just a thought.  Quick action and immediate fights are what I think is needed based off how other games okay today, but I could be wrong in applying that philosophy to eve.
---
Good tip on changing the medical clone before a big engagement.  Thanks!
---
It’s the need for instant-gratification that is ruining EVE and everything else.
---
Recently I've become a cloaky hunter  but I've missed a few kills due to the target delay while decloaking. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. I'm also looking into running a bomber as tackle due to the absence of the target delay. I would only do this if the rest of the fleet is on grid because bombers dont really have enough tank. Suggestions?
---
This is about the most insightful post I’ve ever read on r/eve. The Aging Playerbase section especially hit home on all points.  
---
I’m 32 now with a toddler at home. When I first started playing I was still in school! Work and family demands prevent me from staying up til midnight or 1AM on the reg. And it’s virtually impossible to ever set aside a couple hours of eve time that align with fleets. 
---
So what do I do with some smaller windows of downtime instead? Netflix, Twitch, or a couple games of Overwatch. 
---
I think CCP was smart to add some difficult content like abyssal space and abyssal PVP that you can log in and do for a 20-40 minute play session but even that gets old pretty quick. 
---
I don’t have an answer to turn it around but everything you wrote rings very true to me.
---
End game in EVE is so, so much better.
---
For a guy who tells everyone in every thread about how you quit, you sure do post a fuck ton about how you quit, and it's every single decision of the day that did it.
---
Basically if you think the older newer stuff is old, you might agree with me more than you think.
---
Wait...eve has an end game
---
Did you just write 5k words to tell people that you died because you logged off in a belt and that that is somehow anyone elses fault but your own? Jesus Christ.
---
Agreed, but it fuels the greedy companies.  And it's what our capitalist society wants, yesterday.
---
True.
---
Now this is how you post.
---
Okay so we have a bunch problems in one post lets go piece by piece
---
The MER:
---
I never said the MER is great. In fact the developments are really concerning but fixing your MER by driving those off who make it that huge isnt the way to go if you check my previous comments on a different post there was a solution discussed that should serve both small Gang guys and the MER.
---
In short Anomalie should have a rating similiar to ded ratigg that says what ship they should be done in if you Overkill you nerf your payout if you go below that recommendation you get a buff to payout for the effort and the activity it takes.
---
For The groups:
---
If you wanna distinct the three groups then explain pls why 2/3 of them are doing the Same just with different results.
---
On the listening to PVPers part:
---
Its Not Bad listening to them as this is content. But following bad ideas with eves Level of Player retention is just worse then waiting a few more weeks and bring up the Real issue to Adress.
---
On the quitting:
---
1. I never said i would quit
---
2. Its Not just about the Blackout but also about the cyno changes upcoming and the Overall way this is going.
---
As laid out by OP and several other posts they Not just shoot at the wrong target but they are also missing it by far.
---
And for the quitting Part i can Tell you for Sure that most Corps in null rn encounter a severe issue of Cash influx through taxes which actually is backed by the latest MER and this Overall means that there are a a lot of guys now Not logging in to Do their usual stuff and therefore also likeley Not showing up for content so we loose players Day by Day even when they are Not showing up on the unsubbing metric yet.
---
While I am a PvP oriented dude, this is just plain dumb shit.  CCP would never let you be ISK positive with PvP kills. It would just spiral down till one dude was left with all the isk and no-one else could afford to buy anything that could shoot back.
---
FFS people can't you just be grateful we don't have to train all of our JF cyno alts into bombers?
---
anything a human can do in a video game a computer script can do better, in time they will account for the jumping out and back in bit.
---
tell me i'm elite
---
pretty much
---
How would you be screwed if you didn't use the SP for that? The SP he's talking about is obviously the event/login SP, and it doesn't expire. If he would have waited till the changes were finalized, or fuck, even on the test server, then he could have consumed the SP then. But people jumping the gun on shit that wasn't finalized and wasn't even on the test server yet.
---
I GOT A WARNING FROM GM DAN FOR CALLING A DUDE A PUSSY FUCK DUDE YOU JOKIMG ME RN
---
I don't agree with you at all, no matter what era of eve we're talking about.
---
I came back after drifters and blackout. CCP got rid of drifters, and blackout risk was managed by using T2 mining drones instead of excavs. Cynos just make moving and logistics a giant pain in the ass. At some point you realize that your hobby for the last 10 or 11 years just isn't fun anymore and you shrug off the some $40,000 in PLEX and subscriptions you sank into that hobby. I don't want to admit the sunk cost and walk away. I mean I built a $6,000 computer exclusively for multi-boxing in EVE. I'm guess I'm just disappointed I don't look forward to playing EVE anymore and haven't come to terms with that part of my reality isn't going to be a part of me and I will likely lose my friends I made in EVE over the years. I still kind of want to fight for the things that would make the game playable for me with the small chance that CCP might actually care about it and give me a reason to come back. 
---
As for /r/eve, I enjoy 
---
1. Throwing around my disposable income (basically why I played EVE) at things I find fun; and my gun safe, garage, and ammo room are all full so now I get to buy Reddit Gold.
---
2. And I enjoy showing my discontent with the state of my favorite video game. Having EVE's L33T reddit legion tear me down and tell me to fuck off is a sick kind of enjoyment I guess.
---
CCP just wanted to implement a dirty hack without doing any dev work or re-design. Seems "Chaos" is just an excuse to make stupid changes and test it in production instead of thinking anything through. At the same time pissing off most of their player base.
---
I just don’t think you really know what you are talking about.  You think SBUs are old.   So you are obviously a noob.  /o
---
That is complete and utter horseshit. The change for cynos was advertised with more than adequate time for logistics groups to train their cyno characters into a covert cyno, even an astero can mount one and be safe again in 30 seconds. With jump freighters being able to take covert cynos, you can keep a cyno cloaked and hidden and only be exposed for 30 seconds or less. There is zero excuses beyond "CCP is changing something and I don't like it."  
---
Capital and super capital warfare are the styles going to be most affected and I have little sympathy for it when the default answer to pretty much everything in null, and in some cases low, was to drop caps on it.
---
Meh. It gave me an opportunity to vent. I was actually quite looking forward to using cov-ops, although I agree with others that it seemed a 'strange' mechanic to have in the game. Having said that, the 'industrial' fix is even worse. Having to slow-boat industrials around to your mids? How tedious.
---
Having to sell stuff I just bought isn't really a problem although the wasted SP is. I'm still annoyed about that. Cov-ops V on a hauler cyno alt *is* a waste of SP
---
10k que is super optimistic, friend. I just saw a 29k que on Stalagg.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Clone_states#Alpha_skill_set has the details. Basically you get first few months of ship progression for free. T1 ships aren't less powerful, more that T2 ships (which you can't fly) are specialized to narrow roles while T1s are usually generalists.
---
We need more baby seals in the game.
---
fucking nate is a bad influence, hy's mom shouldn't let them hang out
---
unpopular opinion but if they left the proving gate open 24/7 abyssal pvp could be this.
---
I don’t think the issue isn’t attention span, its the older demographics.  Adults have obligations that need attention that may only leave them with free time for a half-hour to an hour at a time.  A game that takes 2 hours to do a fleet isn’t practical for a person with a job, a wife, and two kids.
---
Then you can just sit a cloaky in there and bridge a bomber fleet in after the timer ends.
---
if you're USTZ and still looking for one, I can log in and give you one
---
my .02:
---
1)  The control scheme in the game is dated and the limited maneuvering options are pathetic.  If they invested the resources, they possibly could have updated the game with a new engine were you could use mouse steering, etc, to make it more exciting to fly. I know you can double click to move but it's lame.  I think a lot of players are lost on the first day when they see how basic the piloting is.
---
2)  Its a terribly bland social atmosphere.  Just a chatbox.  Walking in stations was actually a good idea from a social perspective.  They fucked it up with the micro-transactions, but fundamentally it was a cool idea.
---
Without the above, the game is just too clumsy and alienating to the average player.
---
The rocks don't make funny noises tho

Outch time for a little tayra expedition
---
Eh, so eve is doomed no matter what?
---
No shit duder - nothing lasts forever, and definitely not video games.
---
What's your point? The CCP should just let it stagnate until it dies?
---
Nah, let them change it and try to fix it. 
---
You suggest that it's better, or necessary to cater to people basically logging on and ratting or mining while chatting because they don't have the time anymore?
---
Hard pass. I'll take my chances with change, it seems so will CCP. Sorry about your playstyle guy (I'm not actually).
---
It's just a game man, ofc it's going to change and eventually shut down. Move along with your life baby, it's a big world outside!
---
Happy times incoming moving my cyno-indu 19 jumps through nullsec...
---
&gt; This is very much a nullsec (maybe wh?) mentality.
---
It wasn't always like that though. You gained more the more time you put in, but it wasn't the cost of entry.
---
That does beg the question: how do you get the younger demographic to play the game? How do you lure the 16-22 year olds with infinite free time away from other games? I know I started playing when I was in college, but that was over a decade ago, how do we get the modern college student playing?
---
But yes, I agree for those with little free time then null sec isn't really gonna work usually, that's why Eve needs to offer other areas of content!
---
Not your bro, Guy. Also I do not know who Stainguy is and there is no "Chimp of the Month" contest. Try harder. Like reach deep down and really unleash your inner reeetard. Your shit is lame.
---
This right here is the problem.  There is no change that is worse for the blocs than for anyone else trying to live in null.
---
We've got the resources to park faxes and caps next to every rorq ball.  Small folks can't do that.  And we need more small groups in null if there is going to be more conflict.
---

I respectfully disagree. Swimming upstream can be a strategy if you are good in your niche. Because you are doing something that nobody else is offering.
---
Take paradox interactive. They do grand strategy game, not exactly the most popular type of game around. EU4 is from 2013 and has 11K average concurrent players. CK2 is from 2012 and has 8K average players. Hearts of Iron from 2016 has 24K average players. EU4 median age was 26 in 2016 ( couldn't find the average). 
---
And honestly, their learning curve is as steep as Eve Online. And each game is for the long run.
---
Only difference i see is that their NPE manage to have meaning while avoiding to put the new player in a boring cocoon : just pick an Irish opm or the BBB at start. Eve on the opposite throw new players in decade old PVE without informing him/she about the larger and much more interesting world.
---
On another style Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld and Oxygen Not Included also have a player base while being harsh.
---
All those are single player games but why not : Eve has such a complexity and endless possibilities that I truly think that its target audience is not only MMO players but it can draw from this crowd.
---
Maybe don't pick a real that is completely full and then complain about it.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
You spin your titan in a keepstar until you get bored and unsub.
---
Not your Guy, Buddeh.   
---
I was going to ask how much Mittens pays you to whiteknight for Goons on r/EVE, but your "passion" seems to be genuine, so I can only assume you're just that into riding his E-Peen.  
---
Relax, your virginity is safe. No need to be angry.  
---
Found a photo of your average goon after crying about changes on Reddit:
---
Brb,  Setting up some tornados
---
Even not AFK at all and paying attention to the best of your ability, it is extremely likely you will die in anything under a capital ship at the moment.
---
Really? I almost never have two hours of uninterrupted game play. 
---
I do nothing in this game except solo roam, and almost exclusively in nullsec.
---
I've spent maybe 5% of my time in game in a cloaky ship, and very few of my kills are miners or ratters. 
---
Yet I still have plenty of fun flying around and getting into fights. 
---
The key is, don't worry about your killboard and don't let it get to you if you lose a ship.
---
Remember, this is a *~video game~*
---
In no way do you need two interrupted hours to do *anything* in this game.
---
You can be your own FC you know, learning curve may be steep - but if your time is limited, don't have fun on someone else's schedule.
---
How are you getting one dude left with all the isk O_o
---
Now that's classic!
---
Nice! 
---
I've won so many times, my 2007 toon is at around 50mil.
---
But a system like this has never existed, and wasn't necessary to create all the previous wars. And however its designed to work in theory is unlikely to be how it actually works in practice (see every other large gameplay change CCP has added)
---
I think they just need to remove stuff like anoms in favor of belts, and then buff belts to keep up for the inflation that has happened. Makes warp speed being important for ratting, and even mining to a degree, makes people spread out, and its worked in the past so there's no reason it wouldn't work in the future. 
---
I honestly wouldn't be against redoing citadels so that athanors have the same functionality of a pos, shorter timers and no asset safety, and then making the bigger combat focused structures similiar to stations with full asset safety but a limited number per system (per region would be too easy to exploit, goons could anchor keepstars in border regions and no one else would be able to use keepstars in that area. Per constellation might work, though). Add a couple extra service module slots to everything to reduce the need for structure spam, and add another one to make tether a service module.
---
Again, all of this keeps with the stuff that we know works, but improves it. Creating new and regularly shuffled stuff is probably just going to backfire, although as long as they don't fuck up wormholes too bad I will be fine watching the fire from mine.
---
IF YOU WANT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS AN ALLIANCE THEN STOP EVICTING RANDOS UNLESS YOU PLAN TO LIVE IN THEIR SPACE, AND START PUNCHING UP

^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot.  ^^Feedback ^^appreciated.
---
Sooooo...CCP...I invested a few bil into covert Cyno training for freighting. I fucking want that SP back.
---
Exactly.
---
So for example let's say there's a 10 AU stretch of "off-scan" space between two celestials, and let's assume it's the only "off-scan" spot (for simplicity's sake). So you put 3 people in a line along that trajectory at bookmarks 2 AU apart from eachother (a little overlap is good here), with their DScan set to 2AU.
---
You have them launch probes analyze a spot just out of DScan range, 15AU away.
---
After they analyze, they set their probes to pinpoint, 1AU, and then move the box directly on top of their ship.
---
And then they just sit there mashing DScan - "any cyno ship" (so the smoothbrains don't split hairs here) on DScan, and you hit "analyze". With a little luck and good skills, you'll get a warpable hit. And since you're only warping at most 2AU, you have a good chance of landing on grid and getting point.
---
Thanks suicide bot, I really need your support in these trying times.
---
Now THIS is quality dark humor
---
It's all Veldspar, if you're curious. I'll take suicide gankers on my runs with the solace that I did it to myself.
---
Good bot
---
Do you propose any solutions?
---
I mean, local has been on and off (mostly on) in null sec for two days, and not a single comment from CCP. I think at this point, we might need to start contemplating that the game's owners and developers might not give a single fuck.
---
I resubbed because of blackout, and I'm still here, so I'm happy.
---
Can deploy probes and hide them off grid
---
&gt;  How would anyone know to probe? 
---
Cause it's one of the top systems to jump a JF in to get to highsec?
---
If you don't have time then you obviously don't solo roam. What do you need all that isk then if you get SRP for everything you lose? To inject a 5th rorqual?
---
You seem cool and chill.
---
1. It doesn't matter that the DScan is only limited to 14.3 AU. There are only limited locations where safe spots can be made off D-Scan range from a celestial. So you park your guys spaced out along that path with DScan set to 2AU.
---
2. You only analyze once. Your DScan is set to 2AU and probes are pre-staged in pinpoint, 1AU, right on top of your ship. There's a good chance of 100% on the (insert generic cyno ship so smoothbrains don't harp about it) itself. A JF will definitely be warpable.
---
3. Using this technique I've gotten 100% on a Rifter I was hunting during a war. Almost tackled him too but he was in a moving safe and was 60km by the time I landed.
---
4. No need to cycle probes, you're only scanning once. You're not adjusting.
---
You must be fun at parties
---
I've never played WoW because DAoC was still a thing when it came out.  I don't know if Classic would appeal to me or not.
---
I am...  it’s just some people try to talk like they know things when they don’t.  It happens.   I’m used to it, and I’ll shut it down.
---
It’s pay to winnish nowadays since the new company took over
---
Yes, and i stated *another* T2 freighter. Different T2 versions are designed for different tasks; it'd be recycling the same hull but that's not a huge issue.
---
You nailed it.
---
Eve just can't keep new players. 
---
Goons will tell you they are amazing for newbros because they have great roams going out hourly 
---
It's bullshit, new players quickly realize that the prearranged corm and caracal fights between goons and test are horribly boring and not worth logging in for, so they rightfully don't.
---
OP has an excellent point, eve is tough if you don't have lots of time. It's totally doable, I do it - but many won't.
---
Lots of this is the proliferation that eve is only ok to PvP if you are in a group, which you now have to wait on multiple people's schedules to align and everyone's time gets wasted. Not worth to new players.
---
Then if you want to solo PvP because you don't have time to wait for fleets - you get told to go to FW. BUT fw actively punished you with sec status of you PvP someone in a... PvP zone?
---
Eve could definitely use some changes to engage players that don't want to commit large amounts of time to the game at once.
---
They put up as much of a fight as they could under the circumstances. They didn't suicide their titan fleet, but they fought where they could.
---
There are sooooooooooooo many more goons that init though... they can push through 3-4 candidates. Instead they'll get one init in.
---
Found the Rorq Miner.....probably got raped by Olmeca multiple times. 
---
#RorqLivesMatter 🤣🤣🤣
---
Man only 250 gigs of space?
---
yeah what the fuck is going on
---
Actually the  solution is blatantly obvious. CCP has always tried to nurf a part of the gameplay or buff another but it doesn’t address the underlying problem. The ability to blue anyone and over sized alliances. Just taking away the ability to blue corps and Alliances then reduce max alliance and Corp numbers. There would be ways around this but it would take to much effort. The reason PH and Goons our as big as they are because they have large social structures that organize lots of sub groups but the key in game mechanic that makes that possible is being able to blue those groups. Cutting out bluing would also address the age old problem of lag.
---
What? Dude you're doing it wrong. If you want to PvP why did you pay for toons to Indy? 
---
Just buy the packs at 60% off from Green man gaming once or twice a year and transfer shit to your alt and sell the stuff off when the prices get high. 
---
That's more than enough isk to whelp like it's your job.
---
have you not read the new changes to logistic with JF, now it is an industral ship with an industral cyno 
---
updated right after the free skill points events ended making one think it was just another f you.
---
don't get me wrong cyno are OP but once again ccp goes with the biggest hammer they can.
---
Is it worth playing in spite of that or not?
---
No
---
I can't tell if this is a joke?
---
No it’s not or no i should?
---
Just no
---
I wonder if he would consider making this project open source.
---
Called it. They walked it back. We'll have regen-tanked industrial permacynos on keepstars forever now.
---
remember it wasn't just free sp they also did the daily sp rewards for npc kills
---
Haha, did this once myself. The worst were the items that ended up on high sec islands.
---
I gave up after working for a few hours to collect it, now it just sits in my assets driving me insane (it's been 2 years...). Some day I'll convince myself to just thrash it all.
---
And yes, it was also veldspar.
---
It is, unfortunately, not.... I made very very poor choices.
---
Day tripping through wormholes or clowning around FW is basically all I have time for nowadays, and it is absolutely due to irl considerations of wife, daughter, and job. I left null when it became tedious, where ops were basically structure bashes that had no payoff 2/3 of the time (shield + armor). 
---
Say what you want about Dominion SOV ca FozzieSov, but the game really became less fun after that change. 
---
Now yeah I got some friends, we go camp WHs and pop explorers, or go spinning around plexes in FW, but it absolutely doesn’t feel like I’m doing anything besides picking fights for the sake of fights. 
---
Not sure where I’m going with this really, but I agree with you FW is the only casual PVP, and WHs if I have a bit more time. But it used to be in Dominion era, I felt bad missing OPs. I wanted to get counter dropped, or at least blow up a stick... why the fuck would I feel bad about missing the enthralling experience of chasing fucking Tristans with SOV sands off an iHub? I just don’t fucking care anymore.
---
"Buy cheap and reprocess it for a tidy profit, what could be so hard?!"  
---
How naive I was just 2 weeks ago. And I'm probably never going to end up moving it all either. Lol.
---
So one thing you have to realize is that it isn't just EVE's population that exploits a system for maximum benefit, it's all players of all games. When you build a system you have to assume that people will exploit to the maximum, and you have to remove those exploits to the greatest degree possible.
---
Case in point: The VNI. You have a ship that is cheap, low sp, doesn't require attention, makes nearly as much money as it's T2 brother, and can be run on an alpha account. No one should have been surprised to see them proliferate.
---
How do we solve the problem of the mega coalitions? I'm not sure we can, nature has a tendency toward Pareto Distributions, and we are seeing the results of that now. The only way I can think of to stop it is to create a system where shit dies a lot, and is also replaced easily. Sort of a large scale long term RTS game. Titans and Supers need to be dying in massive quantities every time there's a battle, and miners on the home front need to be pumping out capital parts to replace losses. That is what a healthy game would look like. 
---
What we have now is a blackout killing PVE in Sov Null, when the real issue was that Supers don't die enough, hence everyone was stacking them up. Rorquals mass mining things wouldn't be an issue if they were replacing losses instead of adding new numbers to the count constantly.
---
The problem is players who have been around for 10+ years(at least myself, I can't speak for others) get bored with frigates, losing a tristan is not fun, killing one is not fun, and when I fly something that I do consider a risk or fun in FW space no one will take the fight unless it's a blob
---
Yeah I know. I did the whole thing wrong. I don’t want PvP to be my main thing because I’m pretty well shit at most video games, but I like playing them anyway. I’m the guy who could lose a t2 Cane to a reaper.
---
thats another way sure
---
Please gift your shit to me :)
---
Not now that I’m trying to do it right! Trying being the operative word
---
Don't even worry about it dude, we all have embarrassing losses. 
---
Just PvP of that's what you like and don't worry about your killboard.
---
never tried bro.
---
Ducks are cuties.
---
bro 😎💪
---
Haha well just do whatever it is you enjoy in the game, even if you're bad at it. Doesn't matter if you have fun.
---
If you aren't having fun the just stop playing the gAme and go find a game you do like!
---
That's a slippery slope if I ever saw one.
---
I would fight just to kill another group for the fun of it. Problem is it is no longer fun, you can't fight titan super spam with fax without more titan super spam. IMO thats the real problem.
---
I am not going to multibox 20 rorquals for a year to "catch up". Either balance those ships or there is not fun in running a war.
---
Nope
---
Hey, half way there! :D
---
Lol a turbo goon with wormholer flair.
---
I JOINED THE MIGHTY BEANS A FEW MONTHS AGO. ONE WEEK WITH THEM AND I REALIZED HOW FAST SHIT WAS GOING TO HIT THE FAN. FIRESALED MY SHIT AND WENT ON VACATION. I MEAN YEA IT KINDA SUCKS THEY GOT EVICTED BECAUSE OF BACKSIDE DEALS BUT THAT'S EVE. I MEAN IM JUST KINDA TALKING LOUD AT THIS POINT NOT REALLY RAGING. HEY MAN I HAD A GREAT DAY TODAY I HOPE EVERYONE IS ENJOYING THEIR MONDAY.
---
Free players are pretty limited in what you can do. Can’t really mine except the smallest worst mining ship, can’t do level 4 missions, can do exploration but can’t use a cloak or nullification. Can do small ship pvp, but might struggle to pay for it with the limited pve income.
---
You can get into it without paying but i suggest to join a corp that will help you and you can pay with jngame currency
---
DAoC was great, I played Midgard on Merlin and RvRvR was always fun.  Wish more games adopted it instead of only two factions for the most part.
---
I chose the flair of the loudest most autistic screechiest group there is so I could fit in here on r/eve. It is what it is.
---
New players kebab still? :D But those are easy games to jump in and out of, despite the learning curve.
---
I need to log in to EVE more often (or maybe even less) ... racing to blap an NPC frigate with as many sebos as possible is a thing now?
---
Loosing. There's not a bot for this one? Cmon reddit
---
It was a special event. Not a normal kind of thing.
---
I’m liking it plenty. The logistics part of Indy scratches the right itch. I have to believe that some day I won’t be a terrible pilot
---
My whole playstyle has pretty much been solo, much like what it seems you do. Get a T3/Strat and go on a safari. I primarily played in wormholes though, where it's fairly empty. The low value ships that are mostly afk never appealed to me much about null.
---
But it still doesn't change that eve requires a significant time investment, by which I'd you have a couple other things, there's not much room for "progress"
---
Do you know of any that would be willing to help out, and what do corps have to gain from that?
---
You won't get better if you don't try. But if Indy is what you want to do then have at it!
---
What corps you in? Or are you?
---
&gt;this game isn't supposed to be easy It isn't CCP's job to make things easier for you or to coddle you as you jump through space
---
true
---
on the other hand
---
the game is, at some level
---
supposed to be fun
---
vOv
---
Completely disagree, I'm sorry you now have to put in slightly more effort for your jump freighting, cost it in, or get good like some of the big dudes and run 12 JF at a time, they can afford the 20k m3 per jump I think, also if you're smart you could probably seed the popular mids with Indies... Or purchase at a slight premium if you're lazy, many options...
---
My corp accepts noobs as far as i know, they did accept me. Also they gain a pilot that can help them once he knows more
---
Miss the blog :D
---
Eve is a Pay To Play game with a overly generous experimentation period!
---
It's not a pay to win at all! You can expend real life money and get ahead super fast, you will probably do something exceptionally stupid thought, something that will cost you much more than you can stomach... All because you went all "fuck it" and payed top dollar to get to a point you didn't deserve to reach, let alone were even prepared to be. o/
---
HOLY DANM
---
lol, love it
---
underated comment i cant give you enough upvotes.
---
&gt;Once upon a time, Goons and TEST were sworn enemies. 
---
You know before that time, Goons and TEST were best friends and goons helped cultivate TEST in Curse.
---
Idk man, I think you should try it in null.
---
Take a cloaky to a mid size blocs space and start shooting their ratters or miners.
---
You'll find a surprising number of dudes in hulks, ratting ishtars, rorqs with excavators, etc.
---
These are all high value targets you can rapidly melt whether they are afk or not. 
---
Then you'll get a response fleet to play with. 
---
Just check out dotlan and go to the bright spots.
---
You really don't need to do a lot of research or setup. 
---
Honestly it's kind of advantage if you pop in, kill a couple ships, skirmish a bit - then go cloak up in a safe for a couple hours while you take the kids out. Come back and repeat. 
---
Just don't be afraid to lose your ship, take fights you can/should lose. Those are the most rewarding wins anyways. 
---
If you're only going to fight the easy wins then yeah you'll really beat yourself up looking for the "right" fight.
---
Praise Mittens! But for real though. Your shit is weak. and I like it! As for my virginity, how's your booty hole looking? Let me pop my cherry on your sweet hershey hole and pack in that weak shit. Hit me with that social media. Lets meet up in Vegas, turn my whiteknight into a brown knight.. I'll bring the Red mascara too, I want you to look like you are crying blood when giving up that booty to me.
---
You're lame af kid.  
---
Just keeping it safe so PC Reeeeeeddit doesn't get upset  
---
You, however, are a good representation of goonswarm, since we already knew it was full of people with less than stellar IQs
---
Those Paradox games do not require hours-long sessions. They are single player games, you can jump into a Stellaris game genociding xenos, stop and go take care of stuff for an hour, then come back whenever you want. Nor were any sort of commitment needed: you are always at full power and the only thing you lacks compared to an experienced player is skill, while in EVE you will have a desperate skill (the mechanic) and ISK gap as well.
---
Frantically, you don't even need to get good at Paradox games at all. You can be completely shit, stuck on Civilian difficulty, but still enjoy kicking the Allies' face off the Earth with USSR. Not so much for EVE.
---
Don't listen to the people saying don't play it.  Try it out for a bit, see if you like the game and want to take the plunge.  You wont be making enough isk to play for free on omega without the game being much more involved.
---
Right now a lot of reddit warriors are negative towards the game because CCP are working on taking away their win-buttons.
---
That's not how it works. Not even close! You, good sir, clearly don't know what you are talking about, and your unfamiliarity with this shines through your comment clear as day.
---
You can't spin a Titan in a keepstar. It remains frustratingly stuck, only allowing slight jiggling up and down.
---
You've misunderstood me. What I meant was that the game needs to provide ways to get content --- including PVP content --- in a short period of time. Cutting travel time by buffing WH spawn rates and the like for example can work.
---
You like to take weird assumptions and let your prejudice fool you during our exchanges. Maybe it's you who need to see the big world outside?
---
How is it pay to win?
---
How do you change the game to suit the aging population I stead of relying on new players that have a lot of time?
---
Yes the game isn't pay to win
---
Fantastic. Thanks for the quality laugh you gave me. Upvoting away
---
Hahahaha I already have all the cyno stuff trained to V on 40 some characters. I've been playing for over a decade dude. It was more about not being able to light a cyno with a rookie ship. I move fleets of rorqs, capitals, and sometimes super capitals at a time through nul and sometimes through low sec. The initial announcement was for blops battle ships or recons to have hard cynos which was retarded, and still is. Jump freighters are my side bitch. 
---
CCP could have put a mass limit and area cyno jammer after effect on cynos, but no, they went and killed the ability for 95% of ships in eve to be used in logistics. 
---
It was a poor change, poorly thought out, in another long line of poor changes that are driving a portion of the player base away because eve isn't the fun relaxing game it was (i lived in w space for 6 fucking years so dont give me that nul bear bullshit, i live there now and enjoyed it, but I've done just about everything in EVE). Eve is becoming too much of a chore and a job for logistics and indy types, which is what i do when i cant find pvp content or dont feel like or have the time for pvp. 
---
Some of us are grown ups with jobs and families and other shit outside of EVE.
---
Have you ever hauled indy ships in a jf?
---
Some of those systems are lowsec. 
---
Use a HIC.
---
It's the society that is forcing our playstyles to converge onto so-called instant gratification. If you want to blame the gamers for having a real life and trying to get as much content as they can during the limited time they have --- try again.
---
Ye that aswell. Keep forgetting alphas will affect. I do the same and all those accounts will up the numbers as you say. I mean, we can put it in a simple way, the entire purpose of a login event is to make people log in. So there is 100% a positive effect and I think people keep underestimating its actual effect on the counter.
---
Not op.
---
If the disease is caused by old age, near post scarcity, dead grudges, and too much time commitment...
---
then maybe it's time for a reset.
---
Make EVE 2
---
Olmeca, the bulk of the stuff on that agenda, other than FW stuff, is all things that would directly improve your own playstyle. That's what I mean when I say "your agenda."  
---
&gt; Let me just make up my mind here with knowing things you don't know and I can't talk about. I have an educated guess that, not me as a CSM member, but the campaign itself affected stuff. I am not even saying anything final here.
---
And as I said before, even if they are telling you "yeah, we made the changes because of your video" that's probably bullshit designed to blow smoke up your ass.  It's what I said - people will always say nice things to your face, even when it's bogus. Don't drink your own koolaid.
---
I think there's a lot of reasons why people prefer shorter games, i would consider myself an older and hardcore gamer, yet i now enjoy short games. 
---
I think my personal reasons are not even time constraints of having a job, more the ability to drop the game at a moments notice to do something else whether IRL or with someone in another game.
---
EVE isn't something you can drop like a hat, you need to make sure you are safe, especially in more expensive ships.
---
How long did you wait for rats to spawn in your desired belt?
---
Having more buttons to spam and rebuff 24/7 isn't innovation.
---
Reading.  Try it.  Specifically:
---
&gt;That doesn't mean this is fucking hell, it's a pain in the ass for no improvement.
---
Nerfing blocs is buffing low time commitment content, how can you not see that?
---
(Probably because you belong to a bloc?)
---
Bloc content is fleet fights, even when they advertise "small gang roams" it's still usually a mid size fleet of 30-50. That takes time. 
---
Much of that "content" is prearranged bs fights between two blocs, those aren't fun more than maybe a few times.
---
Blocs actively discourage anyone bringing content to them (everyone from brave to goons does it, just on different levels). 
---
Meaning that for others to roam to their space it takes time and coordination.
---
That leaves you with FW which is canned PvP at best.
---
Nerf the blocs, Nerf the cynos, Nerf the cit spam, all these things promote more low time commitment PvP. 
---
It's the answer you're asking for, just not the way you wished it would happen ;)
---
It was sad. One of my corpmates used to camp OSY-UD (Serpentis Mission system) for 12 hrs a day or something, and he was so notorious during the early days of Fraternity's rise that some people might still remember him. I used to camp OSY-UD with him from time to time, and the thrill of blowing shit up before the response fleet gets to the pocket... Man. It was fun.
---
Then he got a girlfriend and he haven't touched EVE since last year
---
On the cruiser around 40-50 mins between attempts. The battleship took hours for rats to spawn. I don't know if it was the weekend or what but I think it was 3 maybe 4 hours waiting for the rats.
---
It’s a great game. This sub is salty from a few recent changes impacting some of the large older player alliances. Highly recommend diving in, getting your ship blown up a bunch :) tons to do
---
I was thinking along the same lines. The landscape has changed in so many ways, but Eve hasn’t changed to adjust to those new realities and changes
---
I think you're lying to yourself if you don't think eve, more than any other game, has players that optimize the hell out of everything and exploit everything that can be. The game is nicknamed "spreadsheets in space" by some and actively requires a lot of research to get a good grasp of many of the game's mechanics. Where "all games" tend to have a great deal of inattentive or casual players, players that will dip into things but not get in deep yet stay longterm, eve is not like that. Even less active players knew to multibox some rorquals or go carrier ratting in umbrella space for safe maximum gains. Because those that don't bother to do research and calculate won't really stick with EVE longterm, it's not a game like any other.

As for your system "where shit dies a lot", that's how null used to be before megacoalitions, when players were more actively looking to make their own thing with smaller groups rather than being a tiny cog in a megacoalition. Big part of that is the mentality nowadays, which is rather apparent in a lot of the "the game is dying because these changes" on here. Having the "thought out strategy" arrive in 6 months with ample time and details for the big groups to adjust to the next best thing for maximum ISK and minimum risk/PVP wouldn't change anything.
---
When I was a boy I played a very cool game called Eve Online.  They gave you a ship and told you to F off.  We would spend hrs playing and actually set alarm clocks to train and get up for good fights.  Those were the fricking days....now people want to game on their own terms, with no effort and in 20 min blocks....

---
I agree utterly about the difference of commitment. My post was more about how a studio can be competitive while specializing in a unique niche of game.
---
Of course in single player, you can always pause, save and reload later. By definition, there is no persistent universe.
---
You can tone down the difficulty but I think most paradox players come for the opposite. Otherwise they would play other strategy games with a less complex system or generic 4X. Imao Stellaris lost a bit this wibe.
---
Just saying that if Paradox manages to hold its own, CCP can.
---
Holy crap the truth behind this.  I have seen so many corps dissolve (Including one of my own!) because out of the \~70 people in it not one of them has the time for the responsibility.  The ones that are not closing shop are often coasting on AFK leadership.
---
If you wanna die with dignity you have to die as an infant cause the rest will probably shit and piss themselves. Its just a bad excuse dude, you are totally disregarding that good changes will buy it more time and instead arguing that we should kill it faster so it aligns with what you perceive to be dignity.
---
Also its a cowardly approach to arguments because you cant lose. If people argue these changes are bad you just pull youre oneliner and thats that. 
---
Not to mention that this is the worst way of doing business, like ever. And you might not understand it but using that argument only serves to exclude you from the discussion, not the other way around.
---
right click trash.
---
Yes, ignore the naysayers. I'm sad I even have to say that. A lot of people think the game is past its prime, but it only is,if we let it be. There's lots of corps out there to help newbros. It's a game that requires dedication, so be prepared. It's worth whatever you put into it. Fly safe!
---
I think its pitch really.  You have to bitch at just the right pitch.  Think of like, the original AOE titan event that got them nerfed 30 days later, or the hictor shit for wormholes, now this cyno thing. 
---
They fuck up for sure, a LOT, i'm a fairly vocal critic, hence me saying they cave. 
---
I think its gotta be something you can figure out with a tuning fork or those magic sticks they find water with.
---
Tedious is never good
---
Since its a sandbox are not the players supposed to create the solutions and the content.   
---
Seems that OP is pointing out that alliances won't all in fight each other, and the economy is too relaxed and stable, and people are bored.   
---
Wouldn't the alliances actually just going full scale against each other change ALL of that.   
---
Whats the point of leading an alliance in a game you smother by doing very little, instead of eternal war and glory.   
---
That seems to be the problem.
---
Some of the time local comes back by accident in a random rotating-system way, so technically it is more of a rolling brownout. Especially since it smells like something else that is brown.... chocolate!
---
Ryukyu for the win.
---
&gt; Nullsec gameplay has to become more accessible and flexible too.
---
For that to happen, megacoalitions need to cease to be, at least in their current state. If all your neighbours are blue and no enemy can come anywhere near your territory without being automatically vapourised by a blob of supers they can't counter, it's obvious there's not going to be any activity other than PVE.
---
Keep talking dirty! Gonna make that booty pay for it, have you begging for more!
---
This is more or less EXACTLY what happened to my alliance. Over the years it turned into only myself and 1 other very dedicated director/diplo carrying 90% of the leadership burden, managing people, politics, leading fleets.
---
After a while due to real life pressures my co-leader no longer had the time to put into the game and called it quits. I also had real life pressures. A new job, a dating life..I used to have real life dates interrupted by Eve Online drama. I couldn’t do it by myself so we found a nice cozy bloc (Provi) to join. Something to where my guys could still have structure and a place to play.
---
I passed leadership off to a dedicated and talented member of our leadership team but sadly our numbers have never grown to what they were.
---
I still feel guilty. I feel like I abandoned my guys. But I needed a life.
---
&gt;  Fleet Ops that claim to last only one hour are scams,  Losing a subcap has become a non-issue, 
---
One guy in my corp says never fly a ship you can't afford to self-destruct and alt-F4.  Its so true.  I don't have time to gate 3/4 of the way across the map after shooting undefended Fortizar #73,489.
---
People are surely quitting because the product just got better and more fun right?
---
No but sometimes when you blow a ship up, there is an autistic screech noise
---
Hey bud you're almost to 40 people. Proud of you
---
Contrary to what others might have you believe there is no 'right' way to play EVE, do what you enjoy doing
---
Eve that we know and love is dead for years and chaos era is more like a long overdue treatment.
---
"Ultimately those subscribers are not in fact benefiting anyone with the way things are. Mutlibox alt drivers do pony up for the subs which is good for CCP, but overall game health is bad"
---
I disagree having more chars in game to shoot is a good thing. 
---
"cap proliferation and easy ISK printers, and results in overall *less* revenue because so many others are unsubbing because EVE blows if it just becomes a sandbox full of end-game krabs and cap umbrella hot droppers. "
---
some of this i agree with, easy isk printing heck i only need to log my char in once every 30 days and boom easy isk 
---
cap proliferation, this issue was pointed out to ccp.
---
when the rorqual changes happend a lot of players back then stated it would become an issue the role of the ship was to over powered logistic, fleet booster, hauler, compressor and mega miner 
---
Skill injectors, now you could always buy a char but that char took time to train wasn't a case of i have xxxT isk and want 1 of each standard titan please faction titan pilots ohh and i need 30 rorqual pilots hit buy on injectors 5 minutes later theres 40 new capital pilots
---
All current changes do not address these issues 
---
blackout rat/mine we have our super fleet on standby ready to drop on anything/one that moves
---
after the cyno change rat/mine we have our recon/bo and  super fleet on standby ready to drop on anything/one that moves.
---
as you can read the biggest issue isn't really the ships in game it is the skill injectors and ccp won't change that. there is an easy fit too current sp injectors become free all use area injectors and then you item link the new injectors remove caldari frig sp get a caldari frigate injector
---
Come do FW stuff in ships for like 8 mil, and sell the loyalty points you get from FW back for even more frigates.   
---
There are corps that can help you out as well.
---
&gt;This is very much a nullsec (maybe wh?) mentality. I have always lived in lowsec and nowadays I have maybe 1 hour (sometimes less) to play on some weekdays and I’d be lucky to get 2 or 3 straight hours on the weekend, usually not. However, I pretty much always get satisfying content and a few good fights in FW lowsec even with this short timeframe. If only CCP breathed a little life into it it could be great but alas
---
Exactly. EVE is involved or involved as you want it to be. There's a niche for all time constraints.
---
I won the game a while ago simply because i don't have time to commit 4 hours a day for this game. Shit I can barely play 1 hour of Squad, let alone get myself involved with 12+ hrs server lag battles
---
Give it a month or two and they will roll the whole thing back, after people have invested SP and ISK into the change. More chaos. Trying to deflate the economy.
---
The players will absolutely not do anything to help.
---
The players are literally entrenching themselves in fortresses of safety to make money in that they don't use.
---
That's why CCP is shaking it up, that's why CCP is nerfing the nullblocs, because they *are* the problem, certainly not the solution.
---
I agree. 
---
I wonder though, if there are more and more experienced people being left in the game, why are they not taking up doing the management work? Are that many getting so much more busy as the average age shifts from 27 to 32? Or is it just no longer feasible to come close to the massive economies of scale the blocs enjoy?
---
that's going to be all anyone does anymore is drop blops fleets on people. Because that's the only fleet you can bridge with a ship that costs less than 300 mil.
---
Very much this. We need more reasons to actually break things rather than just try to force people to forget they even exist.
---
Activate the siege mod
---
Talking about that sort of stuff in jest is usually not funny. But the bot pushed it so far that I couldn't help but laugh anyways.
---
I stopped playing because it was just getting too boring. Very org I was in never did anything fun. I was in maybe 3 super big fights. The rest were “patrols” 
---
I originally wanted to play this game solo. A freelancer who would work with multiple organizations doing odd jobs or something. This never happened. I didn’t want to be in a huge group with ridiculous rules and teamspeak. I hate teamspeak. 
---
When alpha clones came out I played again. Maxed out my character within a month and flew the best ship I could without having to sub. 
---
Half pointless. Joined a small Corp, did patrols. Then did more patrols. And then some more patrols. 
---
Then I quit the game.
---
there are plenty of solutions posted many a place but it always rings on deaf ears . The fountain battle happened because it was ccp modifying the need for more resource elsewhere that a certain group did not have in abundance .This was a conflict driver. Living in nullsec should be hard but not surviving in null sec. At the moment its hard to survive in nullsec . Supers and Structures made nullsec safe not the way we crab or cynos . Killing rorqs was still possible before blackout ..now you find less and less rorqs each day because once a dude dies he is not stupid enough to fly another one. Even more easier way to say is .Make the resource easy to grab but repetition of it must be difficult . So ratting must be easy but setting up but structure to dock up and safe up when hostiles come shud be curbed. Hostiles should be visible without it there is no conflict . Intel like cynos ,active players in system, active kills and zkill reports should be thwarted. Without fixing structures attacking cyno navigation is like trying to cure amputate your leg when you are having a heart attack.
---
Why would you bolster numbers if youre testing something? There is no way you can get any viable data from that test.
---
Here's my fix.
---
You swap the location of Null and High regions, like, drag and drop where regions are on the map, with regional gates reshuffled so there are connections.
---
You swap Deklein with the Forge, Fade and Pure Blind with Lonetrek, Branch and Tenal with The Citadel. Syndicate with Sinq Laison, Everyshore with Fountain, and so on. All player structures besides jump bridges stay the same, region internal topography stays the same (save CCP some work). Regional gates are added/repointed as needed.
---
Now instead of null blocs sitting in 4 hills in 4 corners of the galaxy, it's 1 hill in the middle and a thunderdome. The closer you get to the middle the better the systems get, but whoever has the middle has enemies on all sides.
---
That would be all of them today, the ques were at like 19k.  Its kinda crazy that blizzard underestimated the load they'd be under by this much.
---
A travel ceptor with zero refine skills can haul enough compressed ore to build at least two sigils and 3 with better refine skills.  Most of NPC null has both refine and industry available in station systems (NPC Delve has a refine in every system, and industry in 8 out of 11).   
---
Worst case scenario, you have to wait 2 hours and 40 minutes to build your cyno ship and then possibly have to gate it 1 or 2 jumps.  NPC null, besides the standard chokepoints, is pretty dead.  THen once your JF is around, you drop-ship in a few more sigil builds and you're GTG.
---
I expect that we'll see more people seeding these ships throughout the galaxy and it just won't really be a problem, as long as you don't mind overpaying for a cyno hull.  
---
In the olden days, it used to be that without expanded cargoholds on your rookie ship, you could only light a cyno without them if you had cyno V and had a velator. Everyone lit cynos with frigates and industrials back then and we all survived.
---
This change is way way more tolerable than the skill cliff for cyno V/t2 ships, the expense that goes along with that (seeding cyno locations, eating the inevitable losses, etc).   The only thing we're missing out on is the ability to cyno into jammed systems with JFs, which was the only good change about needing covops.
---
Anyone who says you'd simply cyno into a safe spot - while that would work for one-off JF jobs - is just retarded, because you could not reliably do that with JFs as often as one would need to accomplish the work which JFs - especially multi-boxed JFs - actually do.
---
Mm that didnt age well.
---
Close.
---
The pro move was to contract it to yourself, accept it as corporation, then join fleet.  Bam! instant rookie ship due to fleet join session change.
---
The beauty of Eve is that it caters to different playstyles. The lowsec enjoyment without significant responsibility certainly works for many. For others, they want to guard their forts, raid those of others, graze fields, or build civilizations.
---
The subtle OPSEC is honestly impressive, no massive black boxes just little ones over the important stuff
---
Very true. FW frig duels are quite the niche gameplay.
---
so really the black out forced you to play the game not just be afk and make isk,  so why not just make it so you can't be afk and make isk 
---
there are so many thing that ccp could do to make it so you can't just afk and do pve.
---
It was the lesser of two evils. At least one could reap the benefits at the other end.
---
Eww darkness
---
You're right in that there's a long list of things yet to be nerfed for nullblocs, it hasn't been near enough yet. 
---
I'm being it'll be sooner rather than later. CCP has identified it's problem child and decided to do something about it.
---
I agree killing something that can fight back and maybe win is far better than a target that can't
---
I mean, each of their realms for classic hold 9,000+ and multiple are full...
---
How do you pay for your ships? If you answer is Plex, well then, someone, somewhere, is grinding that ISK for you...
---
It's not high on the list though. Killing t1 gameplay is higher up on the list.
---
I name all my rookie ship cynos "Epic Solo Kill." 
---
Some people laugh, more often they get quite upset.  Hey man it's just a ship name!
---
Wait, translate it to us.
---
How the fuck there are that many WH in a single system?
---
What do you mean by the second part of that?
---
Industry lvl1 comes pre-trained on characters nowadays, which is all you need to be able to build a t1 industrial.   
---
But yeah people will (and are) still bitching.
---
For a dying game that sucks, the playerbase sure are pretty heavily invested.
---
I have no idea how that happened, but I'm angry and blaming mekwel for it
---
Also, chill on the blackout whining. Hostile are visible when they start killing you even if they are cloaky.
---
They are also visible every single time they jump a gate or wormhole. Now you just gotta watch your entry and exit points and use dscan instead of just looking at a list.
---
If I do end up playing do you think they’d be willing to take on another person?
---
\&gt;  The legit fights are great. 
---
When you say things like this, it makes me wonder if you have really been playing 2006, or you're just shilling. What are you confused about? You get fights where other people are, and you don't where they are not. And sometimes, blobs eat you alive. 
---
This has always been Eve. Unless you are looking for handouts, it is also what makes those non-instanced, non-curated moments fun.
---
Lowsec would be fine if they *banned capitals from it* and make sub-caps rule that space where the largest thing is a battleship, and the largest structure is a Fort, maybe even an Astra. Make null the place you step into the big toys, and change blueprints or something to make caps rare and terrifying again like Titans used to be.
---
There needs to be an accessible place to newer players have smaller corps that won't just get absolutely shit upon by groups with an unassailable capital sphere. This is why so many just don't, or go straight to null.
---
How would i live without this game :(
---
Fun is subjective. You have a minority that has more fun at the expense of the majority group. Thats a net loss.
---
Danger isnt the issue. The lack of counter to it is.
---
Meaningful for who? The guy that gets killed and loses his isk because he couldnt counter cloaky ships?
---
Who are gonna take care of them? Sure as shit wasnt the small gangs or CCP that did it. It was the very same people who now cant do it anymore. 
---
They wont be affected as much as you might think. 
---
So no, this isnt the dark before the dawn.
---
We need eve soundtrack on spootify T_T
---
dreads suck outside of siege.  its the siege module that gives them their strength, and weakness.
---
go down and see how ppl want to fight . Yeah when you get engaged on by 50 bombers on your carrier and die in an instant its called whelping not fighting . There is no combat there even if i am aware situation . if i wanted to live in wspace i wud have .
---
I miss writing it at times. :) But I was utterly burnt out and so tired of dealing with strong emotion. I'm not actually able to do water off a ducks back so I take it all in and it just wore me down. I never developed the think skin needed to be a good Eve player.
---
Un realistic idea based on 10 seconds of forethought: 
---
We/EVE makes robo/AI/automated leaders of corporations. They set semi-random algorithmic goals to do things (go somewhere on space and do something (blow things up, harvest, build etc.)) And then players are incentivized to participate in a way that is somewhat structured and organized by an ai!
---
I say this because this is the only game around where i could see them somehow working this into the story to somehow make sense.
---
Answer: Nope, it's fine.
---
EVE already is EVE 2, its been constantly upgraded for over a decade.
---
CCP just failed to react fast enough to fixing their ill-thought gameplay changes years ago.
---
yeah but as i said . you are trying to get the wrong end of the stick here by nerfing cynos . Interdiction is a thing in nullsec water boarding gates with bubbles . So saying if the you want to respond to a timer and if the enemy has full gate coverage with seboed ceptors and battleships on the gate . Good luck getting your fleet to the objective . You will be force to fight on the gate which will reduce the type of ships you can fly even then  all the enemy has to do is just stall you until the structure repairs and you are back to square one .
---
https://zkillboard.com/group/902/losses/
---
Found it
---
Also, the ability to securitize.
---
Got it. Idiot me. I thought I wasn't supposed to activate siege unless it was an emergency. Read my forums wrong.
---
Eve Online: Exists
---
Star Citizen: I'm about to end this game's entire lifespan.
---
Duh, but what use is a probe off grid?
---
You cant wait for the conclusion as it will get more obscure the more time goes on.
---
/r/eve jobs possibly, you can apply and brose corps in-game as well, there's more there than on the subreddit
---
Lol, please. That's hardly the norm.
---
Even if it were, tough shit. You still live under the umbrella of boson gatecamping Titans... 
---
Somehow you still play the victim.
---
There's a lot of difference between a scram kite tormentor coming into a novice on a web kiting atron, and there being a half dozen t2 frigates and cruisers sitting on the warp gate of a novice.
---
The latter is as common in my experiences in LS as the former. Nothing makes the latter fun.
---
we've had a smaller playerbase in this universe before and survived.  so no.
---
what we need, is a reason for conflict.   as whats the point of war right now besides a fight.
---
resources? any space has all you need.
---
evicting to claim for yourself?  with citadel spam and reinforce, its a chore. no fun.  and takes so much time. can't reinforce an entire system of POS with some dreads and supers like old times in under an hour.   dmg cap artificially makes it so you'll be spending alot of time.
---
and grudges of the past, are largely....empty now.  those with real grudges or rivalries have either left, buried the hatchet, or dont have the motivation after so long.
---
and getting more territory..is just more work. no gain.
---
For sure
---
Also while writing this i just realized i may have accidentally invented one of the things that killed WoW for me: the LFG system. 
---
Which could I guess be acceptable if it's worked into the world to make sense and not just a magical convenience app that removes all social interaction from the game
---
Ye it recovered nicely around the SP events. Hmm wonder if they are related somehow.
---
\&gt;  force a squeeze. 
---
And repeat ad nauseam till we have squeezed the last person out of the game? No.
---
So they just smash the analyze button all day until they get a hit? But if can't see their probes on scan that's a clear sign no one can probe me. Am I missing something?
---
Anyway. Covert cynos for JFs won't be a thing, so why you arguing about it.
---
I don't pick the order of nerfing do i? I already said they haven't gone nearly far enough.
---
Every time a Nerf happens people talk as if it's both temporary, and the last one.
---
Most likely it's permanent and there are many more to come. 
---
Only time will tell.
---
Ramp-up mining rate might be a way to balance Rorquals.
---
Not sure how to do it though.
---
not everyone live under bosoning titans in nullsec . hahahaha . See this is why ccp is killing the game people like you who stereotype nullsecers . if you want new groups into nullsec first support them . United federation of conifers is one of those few small groups out there and we dont boson stuff on gates . And we have fought imperium and Gotg more than once.;
---
Anyone else have a problem with the tech 2 siege module but doesn’t know to have it active for dps or is that just me?
---
I'll take "What is D-Scan" for $500 please, Alex.
---
Even better; use a sunesis. Those things can safely go through lowsec tanking or dodging smartbombs, instawarp and carry 1+k m³.
---
There is simply no denying the damage now after so many poorly thought out changes compounded have drastically warped EVEs economy and created groups with unassailable wealth.
---
There was a time Titans were rare, and feared, for example. Something that took concentrated effort from a big group to build *one of*.  Losing one was *massive*. We need EVE to return to this kind of era.
---
On the same note as being their own person and making a name for themselves - most friends I've introduced ended up leaving because of the constant need for alts. Live in a WH? Better have scanning alts. Mine? Rat? Better have scout alts out, and probably a scan alt to check for WHs opening.
---
You launch the probes and then send them up out of the system, out of d-scan range. Then you can move the marker back down into the system so all you have to do is hit analyze to bring them back.  Then you watch d-scan or local and hit analyze if you see something happening.  
---
Like I said above, I haven't tried this myself, but there's gotta be a reason JF pilots jump straight to a station or citadel.
---
You can't put that glue back in the toothpaste tube unfortunately.
---
Yeah I was going to add onto the original post this idea but you've more or less covered it. Development of leadership personnel in Eve is difficult, especially since there is so little mid-tier content in the game. You're really either a Hisec shitlord/Nullsec newbee or you've got a few rorquals and at least a super. I think a lot of this has to do with the stagnation and abandonment of Lowsec. Many of the most accessible and active PvP groups are led by FCs who cut their teeth in Lowsec back when there was actually a reason to live there.  
---
  
---
I really don't know how CCP resolves this idea other than addressing the concept as you would a tiered system of accessibility. Some alliances (particularly larger alliances like Horde, Goonswarm, and some smaller entities which sort of do the same thing like Waffles, Rote, etc.) really do a decent job of pushing people into overcoming their fear of leading fleets but honestly I think the actual content progression of the game has a long way to go.
---
I don't fucking die to that shit. But that's entirely irrelevant to my subject line.
---
Yes, I have been playing off and on for 12 years.
---
Except blacks op cyno could have been lighted at a deep safe (instead of a station) and noone would have ever known that you were there. You could have shipped loads of JF deep into enemy space (without using any NPC citadels) without anyone noticing. That was a big buff to JFs.
---
like i said does amputating your leg cure you from heart attack no .. so the game is dying . easy . Imperium and jump gates from delve to pureblind.. but here we are nerfing cynos as if they take cynos . If anything nerfing cynos will make small groups harder to hunt because we used to use nullified t3s to get out of bubbles and reach our target .
---
It’s not just you.
---
Its less players. By a lot. Check the MER. 
---
Bots Im quite certain werent affected all that much. They most likely just moved to HS and multiplied there. In fact Im quite certain we have more bots now than pre-blackout, its just that people are reporting them less when they are in HS.
---
Lol 50 minutes lucky you. I've been sitting at about 700 minutes for 3 hours
---
Not to you, which I understand.
---
But it was surely fun for the other crowd to gank you. Same reason people have insta-locking gate camps. It's never fun for the ones at the receiving end of these things. 
---
But again, such is Eve, as there is social contract that requires "fairness" or consensual engagement.  Right?
---
Or would you prefer there to \_be\_ a social contract with fairness, and consensual engagements?
---
I know exactly who UFC are. Some good guys, but mostly pretty blobby and yeah you guys run lots of very cancerous gatecamps. You just aren't particularly good at it haha. 
---
I happen to belong to one of the small null entities. 
---
Living in null and being in a bloc is not the same thing. UFC is a bit better than blocs, only out of a lack of means though. 
---
I've never seen UFC *not* try to blob me while solo. They won't even engage if can't blob.
---
Right I agree. 
---
But the thing is if CCP doesn't change it, it gets worse and over time people leave.   
---
If CCP changes things, then some people will leave, likely more then would join because of the changes.   
---
So in a purely selfish money making way, isn't it in CCPs best interests just to do the bare minimum in changes and let the players smother their own game over a longer time period, so they get the most amount of money of lifetime from the game, with the least amount of effort and payment of wages ?
---
Reread, your just repeating yourself.
---
Upvoting purely for the random capitalisation
---
I understand how they do it. But if JFs had covert cynos they'd never know when to move the probes . Currently they just camp stations anyway.
---
dont worry xD
---
btw, take a look at phoenix. if you want wierd dmg without siege vs in siege.  missiles got wierd properties.
---
I'm betting your aren't successful irl having just made that statement.
---
EVE needs some popcorn content, which lowsec could be if ccp would ever get their head out of their ass
---
I didn't get ganked, man. I'm not going to warp in on unwinnable fights (often). My complaint is that the very space in Eve where you've got the best chance of finding an "honorabru" 1v1 is pretty damn hit or miss on exactly that.
---
eve will be long dead by the time star citizen releases, so will all life on earth
---
Lol blobbing you is a problem in nullsec wow . Ok . Our conversation ends here because obviously you think nullsec shud be like FW plex where 1 v 1s are honored . Again its because ppl like you who are whining continuously who cant roam solo and get that dank bot kill after 2 hours of roaming . May you ruin other small gang content .
---
Productively I presume
---
Balance changes need to be written as an RFC.
---
"We're thinking of doing X, Y, and Z, but not committing to it. We want feedback over the next month. After that, we'll do one of three things;
---
* Say we've scrapped it, 
---
* Announce we're committing to the plan and give a release date,
---
* Propose changes P, Q, and R instead, and repeat the feedback process again."
---
The important trick is to make it abundantly clear what is and is not confirmed. And that speculators speculate at their own risk, and will be ridiculed if they complain.
---
I agree that asset safety is bad.
---
This is actually one of the most well presented arguments I have seen on r/eve in a very very long time and I, sadly, have to agree completely.  
---
As a guy much older than the mean age, I can say from my experience, your points about the shifting demographics are absolutely correct.

I think we (many older gamers) also get a lot less forgiving of gaming companies screwing up games, or gameplay, we like.  You find a place for an enjoyable activity into a tight spot in your day, sacrifice time from other interests, only to have a gaming company literally try to dismantle ‘your’ game....and do an awful job actually reassuring you that they are not going to keep doing it.  The general response is HTFU or leave...well...the older I get the more I think WTF am I doing with my free time  when faced with that.  
---
When I was a kid I kind of brushed off this stuff, but now it just reinforces the idea that they are not interested in you playing and your place in the sandbox.  
---
I just see the current optics of CCP as the worst of all world.  They are making many current playing players unhappy because a lot of people dislike the current changes and trading them for people who have already left the game and in hopes of attracting new people that they are crap at actually keeping.  
---
Well...time will tell.  I just hope that CCP understands that their customer base are now lawyers, doctors, engineers, parents with kids,  with a crap ton of options for their time and money.  Most of us are actually working hard to fit a game that we love into very full days.  I expect very few are happy with CCP telling us, in so many words, that the gameplay you enjoy is crap and HTFU.
---
What's that?
---
I don't think SBUs are old you fucking shit-for-brains. 
---
Did you just gloss over the pos spam bit I mentioned?  I was fucking there for the n+1 bullshittery. 
---
I was asking you to fucking define classic. You have yet to do so, so fuck off.
---
5Head post
---
But the people who started playing in the last 5 yrs or so are still working hard for their first super/titan.
---
Guy is talking shit. NS was against lifeblood. His side argued for it actually since they stated it would create more content and that blocs were getting isk for free.
---
Blocs disliked it because it meant less direct income for them.
---
Managing people sucks.  It's hard, thankless work.  Why would you sign up to do it in your leisure time?
---
That's my excuse at least.
---
Eve is wirth playing in a small and medium sized corporation. Join a guild and have fun for weeks ahead. I joined a small guild with members from all over the world.
---
Didn’t stop the fact you still said it, and then tried to act like a duck to cover up being a noob. Give up.
---
social democracy != communism
---
I'm missing the point here. You grind out ice while waiting for WoW to actually let you in?
---
I wan something that ramps up on large rocks because it could have some binding effect so you can’t use it without some risk and if it take more then ~10k m3 to full ramp up then it’s useless in standard highsec belts
---
Yes. Can I please short Nestors? I was too slow on the way up, but I’ll be damned if they don’t go down soon.
---
Very well said, I think you nailed it pretty good.
---
This definitely rings true for myself and it’s kinda heart wrenching. The truth is a year and a half ago I came back to EvE with some vigor and motivation but the truth eventually wore me down. The time commitment is just unreal. I said this in a “should me and 3 friends start playing EVE” post the other day, it takes 10 hours of preparation for 1 hour(usually much much less) of results. I can’t just login and rat in my wormhole without scanning the chain and setting up scouts or else I’m just being a completely ignorant incompetent player. You risk losing whatever assets and establishment you have by being rushed and careless, then you’re back to square one of spending countless hours just to set up a safely farmable hole.
---
Why would I dump countless hours of preparation and even more time of mental planning just to make sure I can grind isk for an hour or two when I can just jump into a game of LoL and have just as much fun with less stress and worry. 
---
I fucking love the concept of EVE and the depth of it but the truth is a game of this nature MUST require time commitment for it to have the amount of depth it does. I wish it could be any other way, but the EVE most of us know and love CANT BE.
---
If only they could shed their .... dirt eating lives and join
---
I think that's a bit overblown. Calling it 'Useless Ceremonial Cyno' would convey a pretty clear role.
---
I just now read it, I hadn't heard of it and didn't see a thing for it, which is my fault. And I do agree that recons and blops only for cynos is a bit much but it will be better than the current version of drop a cap on EVERYTHING.
---
And that's UFC folks, only interested in blobbing. 
---
Don't stop though, I still take you kids out. And you've never caught me so, winning I guess.
---
 But it's not as if you dudes are some sort of white knights, nor are you a small gang group.
---
UFC is just what nullblocs would look like if they were poor, weak, and unorganized. I actually chuckled when you dropped that name like you were proud if it.
---
I can appreciate a good joke about Communism, because everyone gets it.
---
You literally have shit for a brain.  I went over 3 different eve eras, and asked which you want back.
---
Your absolute sewer of a cranium made the rest up all on its own.
---
There's no fucking duck or cover here.  POS spam is right in my goddamn original comment.  Idiot.
---
That's..... actually a really good idea.
---
Not just you.
---
Your opponent is under no obligation to provide you a fair fight. You are under no obligation to do likewise.
---
Imagine any other game where one group of players work together to build something massively expensive consisting of many moving parts like an umbrella and then have it nerfed to shit because they were being too good at it? In a sandbox game.
---
Like the umbrellas cost trillions of isk and they are supposed to be equal to a couple of billions (at most) worth of ships. In no other game have I ever seen progression being buttfucked in this manner.
---
Alright let us do a practical example. A popular destination for jump freighters is Ignoitton, 3 jumps from Jita. Dotlan has the radius listed as 24,6AU, but i am pretty sure that is supposed to be the diameter not radius.  
---
According to your theory you want to have multiple accounts covering celestials with pre-staged probes, while they also dscan constantly for a covops.  
---
Let us say you cover the 2 outer most celestials with probes. With a radius of ~13AU we get a surface area of 530AU² for the system, we will have to substract a big chunk to account for areas that are not reachable by conventional methods. Let's say the surface area is 250AU², that sounds alright.  
---
Your 2AU dscan probe ships cover a combined 25AU² of those 250AU². That equates to a 1/10th chance to actually catch something, but in reality it is lower because after getting lucky with the JF randomly jumping at that range to your celestial, then you will have to react in time and after all that you still have to secure tackle on the thing.
---
This also means that you have to monitor 2 accounts all by yourself, possibly with a group of friends on standby to execute the actual gank.  
---
I have no reliable number of how many JFs come into the system but i'd argue 2 per hour are on the busy side. Let's say they are being slow and they take 15secs to get into warp after jumping in. That leaves you with a 30sec window to catch something every hour. And i think that is being generous.
---
I also didn't know that we are now counting not catching a frigate in highsec as experience with combat scanning Jump Freighters. Also the scenario you describe is one where you have plenty of time to pinpoint the ship in it's safe by dscan and only then drop the probes on it.  
---
All in all you are setting yourself up to be utterly disappointed by how ineffective you would be.
---
I am proud of it atleast we are small group trying to live here . Your elitism pls tell me any other new group trying to live or hold sov without blueing half the universe yes .
---
&gt; opponent is under no obligation to provide you a fair fight. You are under no obligation to do likewise.
---
No shit. I didnt' post and ask "we should force players to engage on mutually-acceptable terms?" did I? I asked where I could find 1v1 t1 frigate PVP.
---
Setup contracts with Freight companies to move it all, proper collateral... then gank your own shipments.
---
So its not the members that grind isk to get their big ships to help the ones that dont have them? The umbrella is magical? Things you learn on reddit.
---
We are blue to no one, and we don't take the game seriously. We just have fun. 
---
You get pushed in by our roamers fairly regularly actually.
---
Well, it seems like you're asking for good fights to be handed to you, rather than roaming around and creating them yourself.
---
The only way to fix this is to make resources region-specific and stop infinite anomaly spawns in the same system. Break mega-coalitions and force them to spread out. Make wars happen for territories. 
---
Basically, EVE is too safe atm, people have too much isk because they can field caps/rorqs/supers and titans for pve and pvp without much risk or thought. We need to stop that. CCP is moving in the right direction and shaking up some comfort zones but there's still a lot of ground to cover.
---
I've felt for a long time that the map needs cut in half at very least. It bums me out ever time I go roam and go across 40 systems with fuck all in it. That makes me not want to even try that often because my TZ is just inactive and so far apart. The map was built for 100,000, and we have 15% of that.
---
Drifters/Trigs could be part of that fix. The invasion can be the lore reason to kill the old Empires, Concord, and reformat the map into something smaller and far more dynamic.
---
name ? do you hold sov ? if not silence
---
yeah thats such a small addition that would make a huge change
---
Well I am sitting at work at my own company which allows me to be able to talk about eve during work hours....so I am not doing that badly.
---
What do you mean? This is the Classic WoW experience.
---
No sov. I'm not telling you name of Corps I'm in but your recognize it, is v small though.
---
You make the actual gameplay engaging and fun. Not just align/approach/orbit and turn on guns. 
---
If it was anything more engaging to fly your ship and interact with the world, new players would jump in and get hooked quicker.
---
Same. DAOC forever!
---
1. EVE needs resource scarcity and more garbage systems to make the good systems more appealing.
---
2. I'm not usually GRR GONS but goons did destroy NullSec with their "metagaming" and "shady backroom deals"
---
3. CCP has been implementing fast-play content - Abyssals, FW (needs fixing). 
---
4. CCP needs to reduce complexity, streamline the UI, and make resources scarce.
---
C4-C18 wormholes (Drifter Wormholes) get an absolute ton of WH connections to K Space, we rolled into one recently and it had ~50 connections of which ~30 were to nullsec.
---
This is the result of every single play style other than null sec getting massive nerfs for a decade. It’s why I don’t play and why none of my friends play anymore. It’s sad that eve is dying but it was obvious even a few years ago. 
---
Problem is, because of how null works it’s obviously the most vocal community in the game. So really they are probably 95% of the players at any in person meetups, this clearly has the effect of devs only hearing things null people want. 
---
I think that deaths of the game that got beefed out of existence that allowed for shorter game sessions are permanently gone. There is no putting that genie back in the bottle
---
I mean most rocks out in null have upwards of 200km3 so maybe need work on that scale a little bit. Nice idea though.
---
Actually that more than likely indicates mediocrity at best, which is what your previous comment strongly sounds like. 
---
Do the bare minimum to squeeze it the most money with minimum effort? 
---
If that's what they did the servers wouldn't have stayed in so long.
---
U can do incursions and then go omega off that but it will take time and isk to train into that but it’s doable
---
People will use that in low/null/j-space as well. Sounds like it'll displace the Rorqual which gets a similar binding effect when it sieges. 
---
If it doesn't displace the Rorqual, it'll very easily displace Exhumers.
---
I’m a carebear atm so I didn’t know that
---
Yea true
---
Stonks
---
No it's not. Not anymore.
---
Welcome to the wonderful world of injectors.  Maybe he'll try to bring it to HS and get wrecked on a gate.
---
TBH I am not sure what the fix for cynos really is. But this sure as hell isn’t it. This will barely affect the people abusing the cyno mechanic the most, and seriously screw over the smaller corps and solo players.
---
The positive change I can see is that there are no more of the ‘every ship of worth has a cyno’. Tackling a shiny T3C, battleship, or cap will no longer be instantly met with bosons. That is a positive.
---
The negatives outweigh this a fair bit though. Basically cynos are now stuck on expensive hulls. Okay, at first glance this isn’t an issue. However, the intended effect will be neutralized by the larger blocs being able to just SRP the cyno ships. It will also mean that these hulls are going to become stupidly expensive, further pushing people away from them and putting them further out of reach for the average player.
---
The effect I can see is effectively “Unless you are in a large alliance with numerous people that have 5 cyno alts being kept isk positive by titan-ratting, your jumpdrive is disabled”
---
Perhaps a dedicated hull that *cannot* cloak at all, but can fit and light cynos, would work.  
---
Perhaps making the normal cyno module disable the ship from cloaking, and using other detrimental mechanics that makes them not useful as an ‘on-grid cyno alt’.
---
However, the current proposed change is going to completely screw the regular people over. Small corps that don’t have alts and ISK to piss away will now all *have* to use a Frog service. Solo players are just left without any assistance at all for moving normal caps or supers for that matter. So small corps are now having to invest a ton more effort and time to just… move a freakin’ ship.
---
So basically the changes as they are currently proposed would have the opposite effect than what is desired.
---
If the goal is to make capital ownership a royal pain in the ass by introducing a tonne of tedium and stupidity, then as-is it is. But if you’re trying to do what the stated goal is, then you’re going about it in the wrong way.
---
\[edit\]  
---
The more I think about it, I think the best method to ‘fix’ the cyno issue is to make the module only fittable on frigates or cruisers, and making the module fitting-exclusive to the cloaking modules. For instance, if you have a cloaking module on a ship, and attempt to fit a cyno, it will error, stating that the modules are incompatible.
---
I literally spelled out that I spend hours roaming around lowsec looking for 1v1s. Thanks for the input though.
---
Ha. I wish so hard.
---
No.
---
It comes from the fact that before injectors and rorqual mining fleets didn't take 2 hours to get on-field and kill shit, like most fleet's would be in a fight within 30 minutes of form up, the idea of the 2 hours to form a fleet is something that comes from the modern meta, not something that was standard.
---
The idea that historically new players were fine with 2 hour waiting times for fleets is mostly myth, the reality is eve players optimized the fun out of the game to the point where 2 hours before fighting is the new standard.
---
Looking at this from a broader scope and since you took the time to properly structure a post, i might throw a few more things in my reply that you didn't directly mention. I'm sorry for this, but this post makes you sort of the legible, worth reading and replying to, ambassador of the "sov nullbear reeee brigade". So i might mention a few things not directly said by you or aimed at you, but seen mentioned a lot by people who come from a viewpoint similar to yours (even though they can't meaningfully articulate it because of all the salt causing too much frothing at the mouth). Basically, this a lot of words to say "i'm sorry i will lump you in with a bunch of screeching manchildren, but you're the first one to present something close to their point of view in a way a normal person can read and understand" :P
---
Basically, i'm replying to a group and not you personally, because you are the first coherent representative of that group.
---
With that being said, some of what you say i agree with (mainly among the observations made), but the solutions usually proposed by the people in  your part of the eve demographic i highly disagree with (mainly the "keep the game easy/adjust to how the rest of the industry does things" vibe). Ok, making the PvE side of things a bit more engaging would not hurt at all, in fact it would be great, since it's been the weakest part of eve since forever. Other than that, well...
---
I could write a small novel on this subject but to be honest, it all boils down to one thing: players want the same goodies they'd been getting when they could sink more time in the game, without actually putting in the gameplay time anymore because they are now older and have jobs. In other words, this line of reason says "we should slowly kill the game for everyone, or the bittervets will quit for good and kill it faster by quitting". But if this dilemma is true, it's not even a dilemma anymore: it doesn't matter what you do, because death is the outcome in both cases.
---
The solution often proposed is that we should make the game easier to account for an older player base. Well, hell no. The game is trivially easy compared to 10 years ago, making it any easier will suck any notion of challenge and enjoyment out of it. Source: my own personal experience.
---
I came back after 12 years with 2 characters across 2 accounts and 800 million isk across their wallets in total, plus some forgotten and left over ships spread around the map, most of which i couldn't even fly on alpha clone status. I made a new exploration alt on one of these accounts to try out content that was not in the game when i originally quit. I played on and off for 9 months across 2 years. At the end of it all, i had made 12 billion through very casual play, without ever leaving hisec. (Ok, i did wormhole dive and join NPSI roaming fleets, but what i mean is that my base of operations and staging was strictly in hisec). And that's as an alpha clone, with gimped trade skills and a bunch of extra taxes placed on whatever i did.
---
Since then, i have played 4 more months and i am at a point where i can pick up the game and play for 1-2 months whenever i feel like it and have the time for it, plexing my account with isk. I'll soon be at the point where i can plex both of them (actually, this month i made enough to plex both next month and still have leftover billions, but i probably won't yet). I'm not in null, and i'm not even playing full time. I just play a lot for a couple of months whenever RL is not too demanding on me, and then take a break for the next 3-4 months when i have other stuff to do.
---
The game is a walk in the park with a nanny holding your hand and shoving a milk bottle in your mouth every step of the way compared to 2005 or thereabouts, especially if you have some assets and isk accumulated or (most importantly) some SP and existing game knowledge from previous play during more difficult times. I think players should just play the game and stop expecting expect CCP to spoonfeed them the whole way.
---
But then, is it too hard for groups of older players to keep putting in the time? Possibly, but nobody's forcing them to stay in sov null. If it stresses them out, they should move to another part of space (hisec industry, lowsec small scale industry/combat, npc null nomads, wormholes, or a mix of all the above, etc) and start fresh. Of course, to do that they'd have to accept that they can't have the good ores and the dank ratting ticks or whatever else lines their pockets there, they'd have to actually log in and look for their own content (which is usually easier to find than in sov null in many cases anyway) and they'd actually have to learn how to fly they own ship, instead of waiting on discord for pings only to log in, anchor up or cyno in and F1. However, this bit of extra involvement and loss of isk is worth it, because in exchange for it they would get lower operating expenses (they'd make less isk, but they'd also need less isk to keep doing what they do), a more relaxed play style and (this is important) a bigger impact per hour played, because now they are one pilot in an environment of a few dozen or hundreds, instead of 1 in 10000 or more.
---
Personally, my opinion is keep the game hard (lol, it's been easy mode for years, but still) and let the players adjust. And if a bunch of older dudes leave sov null to do something else, this will **finally** destabilize the landscape and either make newbros more relevant and needed (if half your vets leave, suddenly you have half the capitals, half the logistics, half the experience pool and half the people able to fly your doctrines, so you'll have to make do with newbros in kitchen-sink fleets for a while) or make a bloc weak enough for another to pile in and try to kill them. In other words, stagnation solved. There's no reason to keep pandering to the old guard if having them rotate to a different playstyle will be better for the game in the long run.
---
**And i say all this as  a returning bittervet who's almost 40**. Get good, or limit your scope and be happy with what you can comfortably do, or get out of sov null. But don't expect your definition of end-game content to be served to you by the game on a platter in a manner that destabilizes and harms the game, just because you now have a job and a kid. The rest of us want to play too and if something doesn't change, in the end it will be just you, your 30 cyno/capital/rorqual/PI/SP farming alts and a few other dudes just like you in the server. **You are not the only ones who can make the game die by leaving, the rest of us can as well, so let's cut the drama and thinly veiled blackmailing and play the game instead, shall we?**
---
TL;DR Start doing things the hard way again if you want the game to have the slightest chance of maintaining some interest and relevance for newcomers, or pander to the old guard and have it slowly die of stagnation. No, the "but it will die faster if the vets leave" is not a proper argument in favor of the old status quo, because if the outcome is death in both cases, it's not even a dilemma any more. If that's the case and death is inevitable, then it's even more important to change, either as a last ditch effort to shake things up, or simply for the sake of going out with a bang. If the game is to die in 12 months, i'd rather it died in a ball of glorious dumpster fire, than with everyone peacefully running havens or mining spod with their farms of alts. At least a catastrophic ending would be fitting for its legacy and ethos of a sci-fi space dystopia.
---
Yeah man running my own company is mediocrity at its best, hahaha.   
---
Before you get more upset for no reason.   
---
I never said thats what CCP should do. Or what I should even do.   
---
I said SPECIFICALLY  "So in a purely selfish money making way, "  
---
If you were CCP and you knew making changes might cost you 40% of your income per year, and bring the game to a close in 3 years. Or make little to no changes and lose 20% of your income per year and bring the game to a close in 5 years.   
---
Wouldn't you choose the longer life span, and keep more of your employees actually paid for a longer time ?  
---
Personally I would rather them massive shake up things and enjoy even for 3 years, then leave of boredom after a year and hear about it dying 4 years later.
---
Bro. Random hasn't logged in since December 2018 and WAMPS is mothballed.
---
Yep...pretty much the ‘classic’ WoW experience that I remember.
---
Miasmos is the best bet tbh
---
Maybe they actually want it to improve?
---
Yes but a side that can at best amass 20% of null isn't going to take a fight head on with 80% of null.
---
They need to break up the map and assert a real progression curve somehow, so newer players can have fun without worrying about being shit on by capital drive bys and similar nonsense. 
---
My own thought on this is get caps, forts, and keeps the hell out of lowsec at minimum and encourage sub-cap play with small/medium structures where newer players can matter, have their own areas to dominate, and play with people their own level. The ability to write their story as you say without being an F1 jockey.
---
Hey, i miss you.
---
&gt;This also means that you have to closely monitor 2 accounts all by yourself for long stretches of time
---
No. Why are you making shitty assumptions constantly? If CODE. can camp 1 gate for 12 hours I'm sure some group would sit and mash DScan on multiple players for a few hours to score an 8 billion ISK kill.
---
The rest of your post was just wrong on all levels. We're not dealing with "surface areas", we're dealing with straight lines, and very limited areas that are off DScan from any celestial.
---
Depends on what you call worth going into. https://eve-marketdata.com/industry/ore . Look up your anomaly to figure out what’s in it and plug in your yield per hour and figure out if it’s worth running for you brother.
---
That aside there isn’t good money to be made mining in hisec unless you’re botting something nice in a secluded system, where you don’t have to worry about ganks.
---
CCP Games: [dowsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowsing) for balance since 2003.
---
NDA
---
We need 2 things in Eve, 1: a reason to fight and 2: mechanics to allow us to fight without burning out. If these get fixed the game will be rejuvenated.
---
Ofc, there are more stuff that needs to be dealt with but those 2 alone would make a massive difference and create a total war scenario.
---
Do you have reading comprehension issues ?  
---
Which do you think is more likely by CCP ? this is twice that you have entirely missed what was said.   
---
Since you seem unable to get what I am saying in the slightest. Instead tell me what you think will happen.   
---
That CCP will make massive changes, 40% or more of people will unsub because they hate the status quo changing, and Eve will find a massive influx of new players from.... WHERE ?  
---
Is is 13 years old and on rent seeking status for YEARS, you can see that by all the changes to things that haven't happened in a decade. Its job is to just keep monthly income ticking over so that the people have jobs and the power bill gets paid.   
---
You think they are going to suddenly after 13 years switch entirely a different direction and get rid of half the playerbase and put their jobs at risk. Because ?
---
Yes but probes are in space, the wait for a big jf to appear on dscan  then move the probe onto of you and scan you down
---
That is unfortunately against human nature. Wormhole space ended up like that up until hard knocks fell.
---
Maybe if you don't have 4 regions of blue around you, you can undock and get a quick frag.
---
Just have the wormhole mass variance (+/- 25%)  in random wormhole spawn and not in the statics. That way you can keep how wormholers find content and do logistics stuff but punish people who try to roll migrating wormholes for safety or safe krabbing.
---
&gt; punished you with sec status of you PvP someone in a... PvP zone?
---
One of many reasons Lowsec just sucks ass, pure and simple. Its just a place between hisec and nullsec basically. Every time I head out in a frigate to find some action, and jump through 50 systems with *nothing in it*, I feel like I am wasting my time and money on this game.
---
Why are your asking a question that has already been answered and intending you have some intelligent insight to offer? 
---
They are already making changes. 
---
Since the above might not be clear to you, I think the course of action most likely is the course that had already been set. 
---
Best of luck running your own business, I hope you have a backup plan where you aren't the one in charge ;)
---
Can confirm... Getting real fucking tired of deplexing from CN/RU bots
---
Drop in combat with t1 fit atrons (or equivalent) would be neat
---
*Combat Recon intensifies*
---
I hear you man. I tried FW once for a few weeks. In the end it's much see you describe it. I get more fights roaming null many times. 
---
And I don't love paying off sec status at the end of it just so I don't get got by faction police on a gate in hisec if I gotta walk away from the computer for 5 mins.
---
Now it pads your net worth.
---
Can people stole from player wreck we kill?? Because someone ganked me but kinda forgot its 0.5 sec, concord came and my drone blast him  
---
Then i take a look at cargo container with blue color, loot everything then go back to station to store it all, after that I came back to loot blue wreck, I saw someone in Jackdaw sat waiting near the wreck, I ignore it, then I click loot all, but I didn't get all of it...  
---
How can I prevent this in the future??? My gila has low cargo space...
---
Like a true New Eden citizen.
---
My main goal is to have some passive income from an alt doing some safe mining while I figure out something different to do with my main. 
---
I have got some parts for a missile boat Drake (I last played 2012?!) to run missions on - but I got caught up with work and ended up falling out of the game. I’ve got some capital behind me, but I want enough where I can learn how hard I can push a ship and lose a few while I gain mastery of the game. 
---
I have a bit of free-er time and I do find mining space rocks quite relaxing and it allows me to do other stuff while feeling like I’m achieving something in a game. 
---
I guess that mostly means some hi-sec mining on alt and learn some missions on main is the initial way forward?
---
Cool story bro.
---
up vote for last cyno
---
Set up sell orders where it is. You'll be surprised who will buy it.
---
I was sad when I found out my mi Max 3 is also incompatible :( sad pepe
---
So either way they have to still mash the scan button. Not saying it isn't possible. But then they have to scan me down and warp to me before I warp to the gate. Can they do that in 15 seconds?
---
I think the fix for this is re-engineering the map so that those who are on the level of frigates for example can hang with people their own level and have a true progression from there to the big toys and big fights, and be able to fight for owning real estate at each of those levels so players feel like they matter, even if all they can pilot is a T1 fit Rifter.
---
Yeah not many serious JF pilots were bitching about covops cynos. That *was* the silver lining. Now it’s gone and this whole change is categorically shit unless you’re the small minority of hunters who were bad enough to not get kills under an umbrella.
---
This will be a great change for nullsec content I’m sure.
---
Yeah phone typing and didn't feel like fixing autocorrect
---
Its a nice theory but its not true. NS is the reason why people are even staying atm. You think anywhere else is keeping the retention numbers up? How? Look at PH, Karmafleet, Brave, look at their sizes. You think those players would have even stayed in the game were it not for those groups and tons of players that took the time to teach them the game.
---
Youre shitting on the people that have taken the time to help the newest players the most. And now that option is pretty much gone because newer players have it much harder in NS.
---
But youre correct that retention numbers are abysmal. But that is not even close to being NS fault. Newer players dont know anything about the game in any real way, why the fuck would what happens in NS even affect them? And even if it did, how would they even know?
---
Its just a bad reason to blame NS for yet another thing that actually is quite the opposite of the truth.
---
If you were gonna light cynos on stations in those nullsec systems using a covops or bomber then you probably deserve to have fed dozens of bombers until you figured out how to light covops cynos.
---
This module idea might be more feasible. 
---
Make cyno module only fittable to frigates, destroyers, and cruisers. Then make the module disable nullification (similar to higgs and yachts), incompatible with cloaking devices (can't fit one while the other is fit), and perhaps, while the module is active, the host ship's capacitor is bled completely dry to provide energy for the reaction (prevent over-tanking and reduce 'on-grid cyno-alt' usage.
---
Don't worry man, it wasn't your fault that we've been declining, I just really feel like it's eve itself.  I know I can't get fired up about it for anything these days.
---
hahaha so triggered because someone asks a question.   
---
You seem like a little whiny bitch with nothing going for you and no idea of real life.   
---
In other words you have no ideas, no nothing, just a dumb fuck who gets emotional when someone doesn't think the same way he does. You haven't thought anything through in the slightest, you have some real shocks coming up when you get a job.
---
Eve is at its core an RP game. The rivalry will always continue but we need sparks to ignite them into full blown wars.
---
Till Hilmtard decides titans can't dock anymore and/or are removed from the game.  Then you can't even spin them!
---
Hey now, don't disparage the good name of Waffles. We had nothing to do with that..
---
Funnily enough some of  the individual servers have more actives than the entire EVE cluster right now.
---
They added this because they can't ignore hidden posts like they do with replies.
---
Haha, the internet's a funny thing. I can promise you without question that my career outshines your business, even if your are successful - and I probably have a lot more free time to :).
---
Anyways, to keep asking the same already answered question? Come on bub. 
---
CCP had the ideas baby, they are implementing them. Idk why you thought to ask which course of action they might take some as they've already taken it. 
---
Have a nice day and enjoy the game.
---
Yes you can be scanned and tackled within 4 seconds of showing on grid
---
Ye most def. Its become common practice for companies to have egos instead of being businesses. They keep blaming the costumers instead of actually listen to them.
---
It is hypocritical if you complain about losing players from your playstyle, while being okay with said playstyle being the reason that we have hemorrhaged a lot of pvp oriented players.  
---
I would like to see a wide variety of playstyles for every type of player, and i would like every player be able to pursue the goals they have set for themself, wether they be pve or pvp related.  
---
That means that every player has to be ready to compromise on some stuff.  
---
I love blackout, but i would be totally fine with moving back to "normal" local if in turn we get stuff such as the cyno changes (i don't understand why you think that ccp is moving in the wrong direction, it will help fix the broken escalation chain), changes to rorquals turning them back into a boosting not-mining platform, reducing the amount of available anoms in null forcing residents to spread out, objectives that can be poked by roamers to provoke a response fleet,...
---
Null residents will still have FLEX structures protected on citadel grids, Ansiblex no-fatigue highways and absolute supercap supremacy to defend their space. It is not like you are hopeless lambs lead to the slaughter by the changes.  
---
This is why i get irritated when i hear null players complaining about this perceived exodus of players just because you are facing adversity for the first time in 3 years.  
---
Would you react the same way if your space was getting invaded? No, you'd form up and defend your sov. So where is this whiny attitude coming from?  
---
It is reminding me of a spoiled kid in the supermarket aisle throwing a temper tantrum because it can only have 2 types of candy, and not all three. You still get candy, what are you upset about?
---
The fix is correcting EVEs truly abysmal progression curve and reformatting the map into something that isn't so anciently rigid. 
---
How about a system where the maximum fleet size is a small gang, Cruisers the biggest class, where noob groups can fight each other in t1 garbage all day long for dominance of planets and other resources to continue progressing outward into more difficult territory. A new corp incubator if you will. 
---
Frankly, fuck the Blocs, its catering to them that is killing this game. If EVE is to ever have a second renaissance of sorts then it needs massive change, or EVE will die with the last few power blocs being all thats left.
---
I am new myself. Yes, it is pretty fun. Try to join a corporation ASAP, lots of things can only be done in a group unfortunately.
---
Communism with extra steps.
---
Dscan, unless you only cyno into a completely empty system like people can be cloaked. 
---
so the moment you jump freighter appears on dscan people hit analyze point it with a bomber and well rip jump freighter.
---
I chop it up to them no wanting to spend the time or effort into wanting to fully understand an issue, and just flinging poop at something until they get something in the same region where it's not completely broken. Then, somewhere down the line, they introduce other stuff that opens the wound back up and now they have a serious issue they could have dealt with initially.
---
Also lol @ the people following our conversation down just to up or downvote shit.
---
Look, I understand. I do, but I do not agree that moving fleets of capitals or supercaps should be stupidly simple and often cheaply. I do agree the announcement of recons and blops only was restrictive, I have since day one. My problem was always with the cynos in general being mountable to every ship regardless of it's role or class. Especially with capital proliferation.   
---
I know what you mean when it comes to logistics, its is often a pain in the ass. And I don't have a good answer for it. CCP did  announce the industrial cyno, which I was not aware of when I made my original reply, but I want to wait and see when it comes to normal cyno changes. As it stands now, caps are too easy to drop with little to no risk with disposable cynos. I feel that if you are planning to move/ drop caps and super caps you need to stomach the loss and deal with it. As it is now, I cannot count how many times I roam and see caps or super caps almost everywhere I go.   
---
As to the last comment, I work and have a family too. IRL comes first and foremost.
---
Me too!

10,000 nerds, per server to be exact. Multiple servers....Hmm? If only some other game I am thinking of right now could pull off those numbers. Hmm?
---
I was so looking forward to covert ops jf dang, I was already half skilled into it!
---
&gt; The biggest problem new players face is lacking things to do
---
Bingo. There needs to be something like null that only allows the Alpha skillset or something. Cheap, fun, and players can matter in battles for territory and resources with T1 ships
---
Could even do something like introduce a matching system for PVP similar to the Abyssal ones. I thought it would always be awesome if EVE had a Gladiator kind of arena system, new guy can grab a ship and do something immediately with someone his own level.
---
Oooof
---
Not at all lol. It strengthens the capitalist system instead of replacing it with a purely socialist one.
---
Eve was a marvel of its time, there wasn't anything like it so it had a captive audience. There are infinite more options around these days with better graphics, UI, design and PvE and less ancient architecture. I mean, we only just recently got 64 bit, I don't know how you attract the young demographic with what we have.
---
Oddly one of most fun moments in eve. Guristas epic arc, the one mission you get a suicide ship with a giant bomb and you fly it right into a caldari carrier and blow it to hell
---
Wasn't the whole moral of voyager not to use her as a weapon?
---
They can't entice me with sp. I have had my toons since George Bush first term. 😆
---
No. Why are you being so disingenous constantly?  
---
There is a pretty big difference between sitting at a heavily travelled gate, or waiting for the random JF that may or may not come at any second to jump in.  
---
There are people farming Jump Freighters, but i can assure you they are not using your method :)  
---
And also once again you lack an understanding of the mechanics at hand, because you can "triangulate" safespots all over a system.  
---
Also nice argument that you want to plaster *more* accounts on those "lines" that you are describing. You do understand that most jump freighter pilots will just go to a safe, not just the areas of space that you want them to go to.  
---
And man that JF pilot won't be suspicious at all when local is suddenly spiked by +10 people over the usual because you and your buddies are wasting their time.
---
Lived in null fighting alliances every day from release till around 2k12. The null situation right now or woefully boring.
---
"Without the benefits"
---
*looks at anom respawn rate*
---
Lolk
---
I mean, im 26, working 45 hours a week. In retail.
---
On grid? I'm talking about a far out safe spot. Geez
---
Sounds good!
---
How does this affect unexpected long absences from the game?
---
If I'm an active player, but get hit by a bus and spend three months in hospital without being able to press your proposed 'Asset Safety Button', what happens to my stuff?
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
The biggest problem to me is the way new players are introduced is like throwing in minnows with sharks, and being shocked the minnows are an endangered species.
---
I think people do want to fight each other, but EVE has to offer that fight for far cheaper for newbros. The problem is now its like "cool, I have a Condor, I guess I need to wait 4 years to get a Capital ship to actually play the game now". This is bullshit.
---
Megacoalitions are a symptom of that problem, not a cause
---
Can you probe scan and warp to a JF in 15 seconds before it warps to the gate?
---
I'm taking hypothetically about people using covert cynos for JFs.
---
Best idea I've seen is to have asset safety remain for large structures and deminish for smaller ones. Along with a reduction of timers for smaller structures as well.
---
wp
---
Saw flair and moved on. I’m sure eve is extremely uninteresting from a goons perspective.
---
Less easy krabbing. Anything that interferes with it will get whined on.
---
The people that you're after have all basically quit, or learned to enjoy other content.
---
It sucks, but that's the reality of today.
---
Nothing different than waiting for your blackop fc to call jump and maybe you waited all night but nothing happens, that’s even worse.
---
Ok eve is not a FPS you have to make isk to do pvp and pvp is going to cost isk. Plus this is a game that you have to think about and plan what you are doing it's not just jumping in and start shooting.
---
Plus pvp is expensive to learn, most people aren't going to like losing tons of isk getting blown up by bitter vets, it's not fun to have to start over going back to mining to get enough isk to buy a new pvp ship.
---
Then add in that the rules keep changing and the nerfs keep coming. 
---
Cycle that about 3-4 times and people leave the game.
---
Definitely, people will haul shit all over empire space for peanuts. **Peanuts**.
---
I don’t know why they hate themselves so much but it’s a good deal for everyone else.
---
First step... is finding a Corp that you can be a part of.  Find some guys to do stuff with. I will tell you that doing solo pve in hisec will not stay interesting. It’s fulfilling to be part of a unit. 
---
Mission running is a relatively chill thing I would save for your alt. Your main should have your fun stuff. Tier 2’s for pvp kicks and other stuff. Tier 3’s for higher level pve. 
---
I’m a one man show only one character so I don’t have that issue.
---
1. Corp First
---
2. Explore all parts of eve before you pick one.
---
Ps no problem dude it’s a big game
---
I agree with this idea. 
---
Players actively defending their assets should be the only from of asset safety.
---
Want asset safety? Dont take your stuff where its dangerous.
---
Want timezone tanking? Collaborate with players in other timezones.
---
We have these options which drive content and community and yet so many want artificial systems in place that stagnate the game.
---
Don't fly what you can't afford do lose. If you want to fly the big guns learn to actively defend the big guns.
---
They could have. But no! Everyone hated the gong and CCP took it away. And now look where we are. The rocks do not cry out. They do not gurgle. They do not amuse us.
---
I promise you, if the gong had been popular, we would have asteroids with comic sound effects by now. We were fools in our disdain.
---
Honestly short version yes.
---
It doesn't take that many cycles to probe a capital down, you should be able to one-shot it most times.
---
yes, it takes like 1 cycle to probe one down it's a capital hull there massive.
---
once it is a stupid waste of isk to m3 but it is something i'll have to do the bigger question is will the module bpo come out before the change or after
---
I've been playing EVE since 2014. Granted not as long as some, but it's a fair amount of my time invested. Yes, I liked to PVE, I don't see anything wrong with that at all, I paid for my subscription with real cash, so I'll play the game the way I want to.
---
CCP reinvented the Rorqual, which made me skill into it and want to use it. Then gradually after that, nerf after nerf after nerf. I took each nerf with a grain of salt and kept using it, but with each nerf I seemed to gradually loose interest in this beast that I'd spent a lot of my time on.
---
The last straw for me was the blackout. I moved out of null and went back to Highsec. The alliance I was in, went from a 700 character alliance down to 200 odd after I left (coincidence maybe). I tried to adapt, but the nerf bat kept swinging so much that I just lost interest completely and barely even login anymore.
---
The above is the TLDR of my Eve career. I get that some people love to PVP and some people love to PVE, there is no right or wrong way to play Eve (despite what some of the loud people on /r/eve will try to tell you). All these changes to me, are to encourage more PvP and I'm just not interested in that. The way I see it, prior to these changes there was nothing stopping anyone from going out and fighting each other, but in reality all the PvP population wants to do is gank PVE players. That's not fun for me, so yeah I'm out and winning EVE :)
---
And here comes the guy who keeps trying to defend the fail  of "chaos era" that its more than clear that is a total fail. those changes arent solving shit, and definitely they arent in good direction... if they were in good direction there would be no post like these every day...
---
Check out the eve uni website. Most basic mechanics in the game are well documented there
---
I think it can be, but CCP will have to make unpopular changes to do it, which will either save the day or tank their only real money maker.
---
Hey bro! Love the enthusiasm! I have always felt the same way about the game. Feel free to join our discord https://discord.gg/eeCX7ch for questions about Dreddit and also dredditisrecruiting.com Looking forward to seeing you. Good luck! o7
---
Hello Novver,
---
The closest thing to a guide that's around is the (Eve-University Wiki)[https://wiki.eveuniversity.org]. It's not super complete, but it's  the best around. 
---
Your best bet is probably to join a newbie-friendly corp. Eve University runs actual classes in game, and is well respected. The big Player-run alliances each have a newbie-friendly corp or two. Goonswarmf has Karmafleet, Pandemic Legion has Pandemic Horde, and Test Alliance / Legacy Bloc have Dreddit and Brand New Bros. I'm in Dreddit, so of course I recommend them. lol
---
Any of these corps will teach you how to play, what ships to buy and train for, and how to fight. If you're interested in Dreddit, we have a (public Discord. )[https://discordapp.com/invite/eeCX7ch] and (application wiki. )[https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/corps:dreddit:joining] For the others, I'd recommend posting on /r/evejobs to hear from the recruiters! 
---
Whether or not you join Dreddit, I really really think you should find a corp of like-minded people to help you along. This game is big and confusing, and can get lonely and boring pretty easily. 
---
Rule 1: Don't undock in anything you can't afford to lose!
---
Claytonius3
---
Correct answer
---
Getting Evicted. Deliver random BS to person. Structure dies. Aggressors kill ships that were delivered to person. As Trumpty Dumpty would say, fake news.
---
Jspace is noch place for the weak
---
Feels more like shattered whs, but i dont mind
---
GONG
---
you are at least 100% right
---
Where do JF lives
---
waaaaaat
---
danm, thats is scary
---
can you print a lot of iskies on them?
---
You make valid points,  you are forgetting the biggest point.  CCP has had 16 years of money waisted on a whole lot of other failed projects, way too many for me to list.  They have never paid true attention to eve.  Now that an actual pay bonus is involved,  instead of real fixes for real game problems and mechanics we get cheap tricks.
---
Just for plex tho, everything else became dirt cheap
---
HOLY SHIT BEANS GOT FUCKING WRECKED THAT IS THE MOST ONE-SIDED BR I'VE EVER SEEN WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED INNER HELL
---
Aww muffin you salty
---
&gt; I don’t think the issue isn’t attention span, its the older demographics.
---
I don't know that this makes sense (if you're talking about the industry as a whole), considering that the likes of Fortnite, TFT, etc. are hugely popular among young gamers, and they are the peak of drop-in quick-play games. I don't know why, and I don't know when, but at some point the younger crowd lost their appetite for long-play games, and it really shows in the type of game that gets the players these days.
---
&gt; There are infinite more options around these days
---
Are there? What other true sandbox MMOs are there that don't completely suck?
---
A) Provi is hardly a major nullbloc
---
B) No one (except bigger nullblocs) is going to be unseating any of the major players any time soon. Even GotG is pretty secure, and Frat can always retreat up north if they ended up getting evicted. And even if Imperium/Legacy evict all of pandafam they’ll just move somewhere else in the north.
---
&gt; Those Paradox games do not require hours-long sessions. 
---
While that may be true... I'd like to see anyone play an hour at a time of EU4 or CK2.
---
Then you had your flair correct before you changed it.
---
Ask your friends to move it.
---
&gt; Big blobs have always been a part of the game
---
But *one singular big blob that outnumbers everyone else 5:1*? I don't think this has been a normal thing in the past, at least not for this long.
---
I’m a simple man. I see people that want asset safety and i upvote. 
---
Vote for me CSM. I’ll make asset safety dissapear.
---
Just remove it.
---
&gt; Just taking away the ability to blue corps and Alliances then reduce max alliance and Corp numbers.
---
Respectfully, are you new to online gaming? Every game I have ever played, players formed alliances regardless of whether such a mechanic even existed. Hell, *even in io games* people form alliances somehow, games where the average play session is 10 minutes and there's no chat at all. And in every game I've ever seen put some sort of mechanical limit on the size of a group of players, they bypassed that limit. There is no way to force players to attack each other unless you literally make their ship automatically shoot any non-blues nearby, and even then they will just coordinate to stay out of range.
---
I believe the official position is that CODE is ok specifically because it's roleplay. Otherwise it would fall under CCP's anti-harassment policy. My data on that is *ancient* though, so I wouldn't put too much trust in it.
---
I just got a Test Flight invite last night.
---
Why would it die?
---
Yeah, I think this is a pretty big part of it. A huge part of why I hardly play is not because it takes 2 hours for a fleet. It's because it takes 2 hours to have a fleet, and you might not even see any action. While shrinking the map doesn't automatically put EVE into fortnite levels of "instant action", it would go a hell of a long way toward making action a lot easier to find.
---
It only takes a few seconds to win or lose a fight, the issue (and what takes the most time) is *finding* the fight.
---
Eve would be alot better if you actually piloted your ship instead of issuing instructions to it through a spreadsheet style UI. I just dont think it's possible without making a whole new game. It was ok 10 years ago but it's starting to really show its age and I feel more and more disconnected from the game because of it.
---
Hows the loot from t2/3 compared to t4/5? 
---
I did 7 t5 sites today and thought i was gonna make more.
---
It's not pay to win.
---
The using is just the normal game.
---
The free to play is an unlimited time trial
---
Just remove asset safety.
---
Idk.. i never really watched it. 
---
What if they let you bet with isk?
---
God I would be so stoked if my two favorite subs had a love child.
---
Lol 3xETFs on Veldspar
---
I remember then 400m was worth 20 bucks. Ah, good old days.
---
You’re a bot
---
give it to me instead i’ll double it
---
Lmfao, i love this guy’s name. “ducjahtx Hinken”
---
Me looking for Combat Site be like
---
Nothing will ever be enough.
---
What the fuck is that
---
Look both ways before crossing the street
---
The free to play limitations are still a great way to know if you'll want to continue playing the game as an omega. It's what got me hooked.
---
99% if the other don't know a single other person in the fight?
---
citation needed.
---
But then the July one happened and who was on top?
---
And then Olmeca closed up shop.
---
I mean, Eve is pay to win, but simply buying Omega is not.
---
One cycle to probe. Once you catch it on d-scan. Which can be anywhere from 1 to whatever. Then howevwr long it takes to warp. I'd put my bet on the smart JF. I'm sure dumb ones get caught all the time. 
---
I think people pushed back too hard on the original cyno decision. To lose covert cynos is huge.
---
Not really? if you want ISK you want C3/C5/C6 wormholes (C3s for solo, C5/C6s for pairs/trios or, if you can afford a Krab dread, solo in caps), do note that WH sites are *much* harder than K space sites
---
So why didn you just play on a private realm that never updated?
---
Except that isn't how it is.
---
Shooting the first dude in a week or the 90th dude in a week gives the same exact hit.
---
10k queue for the ONLY Oceanic pvp realm at 8 am
---
have cloaking devices use fuel of some sort.  Problem solved.
---
I want asset recovery to be removed from nullsec.
---
This will get rid of citadel spam and capital proliferation. 
---
More loss and risk in nullsec, economy will go up, more shit being lost, big alliances will have more meaning in their wars. 
---
I think it’s the ultimate thing Eve needs.
---
a bot that warps to one of those tacs if someone gets too close and reports anyone who appears on grid with them.
---
If you have no one who you could ask to asset safety your stuff then you lose it. But another option for a system like this is the ability to get a GM to trigger it for you by submitting a ticket which you could easily do on a phone.
---
I need to resub another account so I can run 2x side-by-side on my 49" UW.
---
No it isn't.
---
Nothing can be acquired for real money that can't be acquired in game.
---
Get a hyper ceptor  or 3, sit on tacs.  then use cloaky bubbles. All the while reporting.
---
Naw man, these guys think they know how to fix the “problems” in this game.
---
This game is dope, been playing for a couple years now. The best part is the friendships you form.
---
And then because their death clone is set to the system you killed them in they just come right back.
---
RIP server hamsters
---
Classic WoW. 
---
LoL
---
&gt;The Cyno changes have already caused a significant drop in player concurrent player counts as players unsub to protest the change. I doubt the game will just die because of this one change, but the controversy is pushing EVE further into the abyss. 
---
So this is really about you not liking the necessary Cyno changes. It's only controversial if you don't understand balance.
---
I know russian and did not hear him communicate. He actually guessed targets and checked profiles
---
Eve was never alive to begin with.
---
So what your saying is roll up alpha accounts to asset safety whenever i want got it.
---
You can’t prevent it but they become suspect after so you can freely shoot them.
---
Ouch
---
This is correct. The over-reliance on the blob has made it difficult to find solo/small gang content.
---
I made an alpha account for wormhole seeding.  I've just been training it, but decided today to play for a bit on it with no help from my main.  I spent about two hours running relic sites out of LS and C1-3 wormholes.  Ended up with around 100 mil ISK.  Even avoided a Loki trying to combat scan me.  Exploration definitely feels like the best way for new players to earn some isk while also getting valuable in game knowledge.
---
I'll make two notes:
---
1) This is why eve added micro transactions.  A game can have very few players and still make tons of money due to 'whales'.
---
2) The fact that time is limited more so now then in 2003 (due to all the interesting crap we can do away form the pc) is why i would not be suprized int he slightest if eve echo's becomes more popular then eve normal.
---
&gt;Then if you want to solo PvP because you don't have time to wait for fleets - you get told to go to FW. BUT fw actively punished you with sec status of you PvP someone in a... PvP zone?
---
FW is also mostly dead outside of certain systems which are occupied by smaller blobs in HG stuff with link alts making it effectively impossible for new players to play there.
---
what's that phrase?
---
oh yeah, adapt or die.
---
It takes a full 15 seconds to warp from the moment you land.
---
Now assuming a casual rate of 1 dscan every 5 seconds ( that's not really spawning dscan ). 
---
It gives you 10 seconds to probe down the jump freighter meaning you have 1/2 cycles and a warp, that's perfectly possible.
---
Like the only ship that jumps to coverts in a safe are blopses and that's mostly because they can A cloak B are a battleship hull that means it's a lot harder to scan one down.
---
He's just bullshitting. Real clean IP addresses that are not shared cost \~$20-80/year on average. (Though of course there are some blackhat ways to get around this, though it does introduce some additional maintenance/effort)
---
Then what are you talking about with POS or asset safety? Because POS had timers and Stations had a type of asset safety.
---
Yep. The only way to kill bots for good is to make \*all\* ways of gaining ISK in-game \*require\* a human behind the keyboard. In the industry at large, capchas and the like is used, along with detailed analysis of user activity, along with making gameplay/activities that are \*very\* difficult for bots to be created for.
---
Unfortunately, all of this would require massive, massive changes to core eve-online gameplay.
---
Is Eve kill?
---
They come back forever.
---
That honestly sounds like a lot of fun
---
Just go in Deklein they're all over.
---
Who the fuck would write that shit, you are such a fucking loser, classic.

Your career is cheetos you fucking larper.

see a ping? tough shit, i'm busy killing npc tutorials for SP because  SP is just outrageously valuable that literally nothing else is worth doing until i've sucked at that particular tit.
---

---
as you can see, if it takes me 15 mins to get my SP, that is worth anywhere between 60m/hour and and 200m/hour - and lets be real, it doesn't take 15 mins to kill 1 tutorial npc even in a single civilian rail gun corvette.
---
are you dumb or pretending to? the cyno was covert.
---
Haven’t actually played for the last couple of months lol
---
But how active are the people who log in?
---
I think the answer is we need fresh, young people to take the torch from the old bitter vets.
---
Its really quite comical how much the big boring blue doughnut is thrashing about this like a child that needs a nap.

He comes from a line of creativity and hard working ancestors.

---
And when you are in-game, there's literal queues to do quests. It *is* the legit classic experience, and it's why I'm never touching Classic. I'm *way* too old for dealing with the lack of over a decade's worth of Quality of Life improvements. 
---
However much reason there is to complain about where WoW went, it has polished itself like a motherfucker for a very long time, and if you ever actually played vanilla you should probably remember what a fucking nightmare it was in comparison to modern. 
---
Without the draw of exploring a grand new world and everything being new and amazing, I wouldn't go back to vanilla if you paid me. 
---
Of course, this might just be me being old and cranky. I just don't see what people are expecting out of Classic.
---
guess you haven't seen the front page of the sub?
---
the black out and how it's changing the game is literally all people are asking or caring about.

So NPSI stands for Not Purple Shoot It, when in a fleet your fleet mates are colored purple on your overview and as the name suggests these fleets shoot anyone who isn't purple. Anyone can join these fleets so even people who are at war with each other will sometimes be in these fleets together and NPSI is generally respected by the community so your chances are turning up to one of these fleets and getting ganked by them is minimal. Sometimes they even give out free ships for you to fly, especially if you are new. I recommend beginning with Redemption Road if you are able to make the time they run, they will give you a ship and explain everything about how to move as a fleet and tons of other stuff, they usually do this on every fleet but 1 a month is dedicated to newbros with even more explanation. The other groups generally flash-form (ie they'll announce the fleet 30 mins or so before it begins and it can be anytime someone feels like running one) Spectre Fleet is the big one and you'll find them in the public channel of the same name. A popular streamer named Bjorn Bee also runs these type of fleets and they are usually alot of fun. I haven't really done NPSI for sometime so I'm a bit out of touch, if anyone has info on other groups help this guy out please. ;)
---
I think they are a great introduction to pvp, once you get used to what's going on stop anchoring on the fleet commander and practice flying your ship manually, this will be an essential skill later on and nothing compares to practicing in a live PvP environment.
---
Good luck. ;)

Especially exploration. Best relic sites in the game and completely safe!

This question is literally impossible to answer, we don't even know what makes a game "worth playing" to you
---
BRAWLING IS FOR NERDS WHO DONT WANT TO PUT THE EFFORT INTO ACTUALLY PILOTING AND BLOBBING GAYS
---
**FUCK BRAWLING, KITEY BULLSHIT FTW**
---
nice.  Btw you mention best subcap pvp ship.  I heard they somewhat nerfed T3Cs a year ago or so?
---
when were you when eve was kill?
---
Mate don’t say that :(
---
I used to trade with region-wide buy orders. Modules used for frigate PVP mainly... I wrote a tool to compute freight routes for the stacks of stuff: when enough had piled up in one place to make it worth moving I'd write a public courier contract to move it to the next closest station to the hub that had a decent-sized pile. Eventually fat stacks of easily-sellable highly-profitable stuff would wind up at the hub. And yes I still have small piles of crap all over the region where I did this years ago.
---
Not sure that would work anymore. CCP shitcanned the value of a lot of meta modules when they did a big tiericide pass on them a while back. Meta-4 guns would probably be worthwhile.
---
What. The actual. Fuck.
---
Classic wow will die before Eve does
---
All for an empty pod kill that I back in seconds
---
It was a joke son, relax
---
I managed to kill a 300m Garmur in NS with my Domi before his blob got me.  It's amazing how long people will stay on grid to try and keep a BS pointed.
---
The cyno lasts 30 seconds.
---
So are you lighting cynos with hostiles on grid with you for JF activities?
---
i ran into this exact bot earlier. in NC- there is a bunch (like 7 or 8) of botting myrms running sites together with about half an hour timer before the bot undocks them again
---
How about you answer some of my questions first? 
---
Why should a titan not be countered by smaller, faster ships (like every other ship in the game)?
---
How is the cost of a titan relevant in any way to balance discussions?
---
I actually want HAWs removing altogether, there is no reason for them to exist, but I'd take polarizing them as a compromise.
---
You want the titan to be rock, paper AND scissors (which clearly has nothing to do with the fact you own one....), if you can't see why that's bullshit then I eagerly await your salt from the incoming nerfs.  ;)
---
Best answer...remove sp upon death in your pod and make the pod cost isk
---
Mostly wrong.
---
Most EVE players were always highsec "ghosts" who never really interact with anyone and just run missions and nullsec was always just a very loud minority.
---
Yes, Fortnite players of today will never touch EVE, just like CS players 15 years ago never touched it. These people never mattered though, it's not a game for them. Same with player age, old players quit... well guess what, they're supposed to be replaced with newer players. No one cares you have three kids, you're not the center of the universe, get the fuck out and can I have your stuff.
---
Finally, bringing FFXIV's single-player story as an example of good MMORPG PvE design is fucking retarded and so are you.
---
30 seconds with the reduction on recons.
---
&gt;my friend you are beyond help and you, more than op, are the disease that s turning this wonderful game into some watered down, sociopathic solo playing theme park mmo. 
---
You're an idiot.
---
&gt;I just told the poor bastard to get in a fucking corp? why is that a bad thing, are you nuts? is this some bullshit sjw ing for noobs because you re afraid they re gonna turn off your precious servers? Would you want fleet finder to put you into pve fleets or wha the cock? 
---
You don't know what sjw means do you..?
---
And no, I want the mechanic to be explained to new players. Because it isn't in its current form. 
---
&gt;the more you handhold them at the start the bigger the chance they d turn into the mouthbreathers that complain about ganking and wardecks in hs and about cloaky camping when they re penned into null by these charities/slave enterprises that are nullsec noob corps. 
---
No, the more you explain to them at the start, the more they'll understand the game. The less chance they'll leave when something that was never explained to them happens eg. A high sec gank. And a charity is pretty fucking far from a slave enterprise, you're using two opposites to try to make a point and it's not working. 
---
&gt;yes the npe could use a lot of improvement but what he whined about was really stupid.
---
He's a new player. His points about the new player experience are less stupid than yours. He's going through it first hand. 
---
&gt;Downvote me only if you think i'm right and you don t like the truth :p
---
Nah, I'll downvote you for being an idiot. Everyone else is downvoting you for the same reason.
---
Good thing that isn't the definition of Pay to Win then. 
---
Can you spend money for an advantage? If yes, Pay to Win.
---
Yeah, I had read that and felt like even with all the other changes this was a buff.
---
More options for moving your jf around safely and an even smaller time cost.
---
Loosing is a word though
---
That is actually kind of funny to watch. But would be pretty easy to kill with a saber, no?
---
&gt; Is there really less "active" player or just less bots farming ? 
---
if it's less bots - there wouldn't still be posts on the front page whining about bots.
---
What if Eve is not kill?
---
Why 3b and not 9b?
---
Just allow an alt on the station to light a cyno on the station for fleet without u docking.
---
Eve has, is, and always will be dying, but will never die.
---
I’d recommend having a stock of pirate frigs, cruisers, kiters etc
---
In this case any content is content you can engage with. You can even fight 10 man frig gangs in the right ship. It’s only the true turbo blobs that are unfightable solo.
---
Even better the vigil cyno makes the beacon and allows ANYONE to jump to it.
---
There was a bit of an overhaul a while back that dropped them from 5 subsystems to 4, which did take them down a peg. Just made them "amazing" rather than "how do you do anything against them". The only one that really ate it was the Proteus, which unfortunately has been left not really knowing what it wants to be. (Best use I've seen for one recently was as extended-range hard tackle which can actually be repaired unlike a Devoter.) As far as the others go though, you can fit them either solo or fleet, shield or armor (as appropriate obviously, don't bring a shield Legion) and have them fill almost any role. (Like the only things they don't do are the ridiculous DPS of the Leshak, the high-speed kiting of a Retribution or an Orthrus, or the comically long range scrams of like a Lachesis.)

EVE is VIBRANT compaired to last year....didnt you hear what Hilmar said!? VIIIIIBRANT i say !!!  (quickly give them 100 more sp if they undock)
---
That's not the definition of pay to win.
---
Pay to win REQUIRES paying to win.
---
Ie. Unique powerful weapons and gear.
---
Eve has the subscription, which could be arguably pay to win since it is actually restrictions but it comes from just an old subscription model.
---
Nothing else gives you a unique advantage. So paying only accelerates.
---
For example, a person who has been playing since 2005 with 3 trillion isk, and 4 accounts at max SP. Can you pay money to have an advantage over him?
---
Additionally 15 secs in a JF is a poor metric.
---
A fully expanded JF without any implants will jump much much slower.
---
Additionally as you d scan, the decloaking of the cyno ship would trigger you to be hyper vigilant just before the JF jumped.
---
totally missed the mark multiple times

i think this section accurately describes why i'm less active in eve than ever before.

this weekend, eve got sidelined so i could make cookies. i literally spent more time in front of a fan assisted oven than i did in front of my computer. I never thought i'd ever say that.

AH-AH-AH-AH-AH

You will be surprised, but almost everywhere you can use math to improve performance, sometimes it costs to much effort or money and you are like 'ok, I think intuition is enough'.

Nothing you just said is required for a game to be considered pay to win.

Monetary expenditure = advantage.

Doesnt matter how small.

Doesn't matter what type.

Doesnt matter the degree.

Now fuck off and let me masturbate.
---
&gt; Even if you're ping-warrioring, having content served to you on demand, it takes a SIGNIFICANT amount of time to play.

and you gotta pray that ping happens when you have 2hrs of uninterrupted time.
---
You will find no better sandbox MMO in the world and there likely will never exist one as good as EVE.
---
Now try to calculate how much time it takes to scan ECCM'd bomber, complete warp to it and lock it... I am quite confident this is way more than 60 seconds even for virtue tengu/covops.
---
Hint: OP can do this as well.
---
For someone named "HTFUnerds", OP does a lot of crying about well established game mechanics.
---
Mmm tell me more about rebuttaling arguments Bill. Sounds sexy.
---
Oh haha
---
Of course. I'm taking the best options. What if my cyno ship was never cloaked? What if I was MWDing and afk at some far safe spot and laughing as you spam d-scan every 5 seconds. 
---
And if I had a covert cynos you'd never know when it was lit. Once you saw the JF I'd be aligning and ready to warp before you even started to probe. 
---
15 seconds later and I'm in warp and you just finished your probe. Too late.
---
Good post!
---
I think you have some great points, so if I sum it up for you
---
1) There's no shortage of resources / ISK - so no real reason to fight except grudges. 
---
2) Eve is old and worse than Elite: Dangerous
---
3) The mainstream games nowadays don't require a ton of time to play.
---
I agree completely with 1) and think that should be adressed.
---
2) I don't really agree, we already have a massive influx of new players every week, and I don't think the reason we're losing them has to do with Elite: Dangerous. Improving the UI / UX however, sounds great.
---
3) The mainstream has moved in that direction, I don't think Eve was ever a mainstream game, but there's still a ton of interest in the type of game that eve was. 
---
Not ever going to compete with Fortnite, but for those of us who feel that playing Fortnite offers nothing at all, there's something there, and the big numbers of players trying out the game each week attest to that fact, they are looking for something more...
---
It's /r/Eve

I've been trying to get into EVE Online for over a decade. I keep coming back again and again, at least once a year, and I keep giving up after a few days. Understanding the game and it's interface isn't as hard as people say (it's just a little overwhelming at first and not very well laid out). The game play systems (at early stages) are simple and more similar to other MMOs (and single player space games) then people seem to think. There's an insane number of layers that use that as a foundation, but at it's core it's just like any other MMO (or single player space game) mechanically.
---
The problem is that beyond the pretty graphics and immersive nature of the interface and setting, there's no accessible hook and I get bored really fast. I don't expect to be handed tons of quests like it's WoW, but there needs to be a goal of some kind to work towards, there needs to be a feeling of progressing towards that goal with everything you do in the game, and it has to feel attainable. All those games you mentioned have clear goals as part of their core gameplay loop. Simple ones, at that. Fortnite: Be the one alive at the end. Overwatch: Complete objectives to win the team vs team match. Borderlands: Shoot bandits and aliens to get to the Macguffin. KSP: Get your cute aliens into space. Rimworld: Survive a planet that hates you. Mario: Jump on things to complete levels. Minecraft: Get resources to build cool things. With simple (and sometimes abstract) goals like that, everything you do in those games feels rewarding. Every kill in Fortnite feels meaningful, every time you get a point from an objective feels meaningful in Overwatch, seeing your Kerbals launch just a few feet off the ground feels meaningful because it's progress. Even going a minute without dying in Rimworld feels like something is progressing.
---
Every game has a goal and a core gameplay loop, even if it pretends to be a sandbox game where you 'set your own goals'. A game can't exist without a goal or a core gameplay loop, even if it's an abstract one. As far as I can tell EVE's core is "get money". But the problem is that there's not meaningful feeling of progression, especially early on, and even if there was, "get money" isn't a particularly exciting goal. On top of that, it's player base undermines that goal because people have unfathomable amounts of it represented in ships that are unattainable by a solo player who doesn't submit themselves to a giant group. If there's another goal or I'm misunderstanding the core gameplay loop, feel free to correct me.
---
There's so much to EVE that seems great on paper or from afar, but for the new/solo player trying to get into it, they're greeted with a boring tutorial, dry combat, and loneliness. (Unless they want to join some giant group where they're just a +1 to a member count of people who likely won't remember they exist after an initial welcoming in a Discord or such, in a game they barely understand and have no real investment in.) I long for a "cool space MMO", and EVE has a massive framework of ideas and concepts and mechanics that could make it a truly great one for players of all play styles, time availability, and skill levels. It could even become the greatest sandbox game or MMO of all time.
---
At the end of the day I find myself going to simpler or smaller games that do better at selling their premise, have goals that seem attainable, and don't require me to join a giant group just to play. I don't even like games like Fortnite, but it presented itself and it's core loop with perfection. I knew after a match or two I hated it. With EVE, after a decade of periodic attempts, I don't even know if I hate it or not because I can't chew off any of it to get a proper taste. 
---
I have no idea why I sat here for 30 minutes typing this. I guess I just wanted to vent my frustration from years of wanting to give it a shot. I hope this 'outside looking in longingly' perspective adds something useful to the conversation.
---
TL;DR: The game sucks at selling it's premise, and the core gameplay loop isn't satisfying or rewarding enough for a new player to keep them on the hook for more. I'm also bad at TL;DRs so just read the rest of it.
---
IMO, you should not lose security status while shooting at people inside a PLEX, it's a warzone, *accidents* happen :)
---
That being said: Shooting at people enlisted in faction war should have an impact on your standing towards that faction, because shooting at the *soldiers* of a faction should have *consequences*.
---
Heck. If I had the option to JF to a safe in a covert cyno or risking an instadock jump at a station. I'd take the safe spot. I've seen too many capitals bouncing off stations.

Downvoted as requested

You can easily get few months out of it without paying.
---
EvE Classic when.
---
Test Lances Please Ignore
---
&gt; It's not a pay to win at all!
---
EVE is literally the most pay to win game on the market.
---
On the most extreme end of it, you don't even need to play the game at all, you just swipe your keycard, sell PLEX and then pay other people in-game to do shit for you.
---
A bit, I don't think one should talk in teachy manner when clearly not getting the concept discussed. All of his words could be summarized as 'I think it's an overkill', but yet he goes into discussion and trying to argue without even knowing a single part of the subject (here i'm talking about risks, not exploration)
---
i have a throng that follows me around to remind me im a bad person.
---
Or if you really want a fight that bad just walk into someone's staging...
---
It's a shit TZ though at the moment.
---
Then pay to win isn't bad.
---
But also, you're wrong: https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pay-to-win
---
It's clear he isn't asking about way to spend money in game, otherwise nobody would have an issue with that except the most entitled assholes.
---
If only someone said this would happen
---
Oh wait they did... a lot. And were downvoted to hell and told "gtfo krabs" and that this for sure wouldnt happen
---
YOU WOULDN'T SAY THAT IN AUTZ
---
No no, it's worse when he calls out that the cyno is up, and you open the bridge, but you put the wrong fuel in your bridger, so the fleet can't jump and the FC's tackle t3 gets killed by a krab.
---
I may or may not have been said bridger earlier this week &gt;_&gt;

Appreciate the work Squizz :), but is it intentionally getting removed as part of blackout (ie zkil delay) or is it still in development?

Dude, are you spamming that d-scan with some macro key trigger? Talk about botting.

That's what happens when the bots logout

can we flag local?

Yep not necessary to go so wide, if you want fast fulfillments then 1 jump from Rens is usually enough, 2 if you want to really get things moving - it wont move faster beyond that. Whole region when you have some stupidly low buy price that no one else cares about.

There is a group of 10-15 dedicated voters that downvote me and scale off by ~5 or so each comment tier of a conversation chain.
---
Every two years, since monoclegate, I see a well thought out post like this. The disease is the sluggish changes. I think CCP has been afraid of radical change and trying new things since 2008.
---
I wish I could sink the 8 hours a day I was able to in the past, but I can get what feels like more done for less time in other games. EVE is a mistress, a trophy wife, I no longer have time for.
---
I get not wanting to rock the cash cow, but I think a return to radical change might be the medicine EVE needs. If I resubbed today, the most I'd have time for is to update my PI, update the prices on my sell orders, and maybe run a Haven or a few home defense fights, if anyone even came knocking. There's so many ways to make money in EVE, the real problem is the time sink to collect, rinse, and repeat. I truly miss getting stuck down a wormhole chain for half of a day exploring relic sites.
---
I have to admit,  the ability do load a ship full of fellow nerds and bring them with me is amazing.
---
Sadly, while the underlying mechanics seem to be there (take an Upwell structure and give it movement), my guess is we are far away from things like this in EVE.
---
Get your little staging at crowded system or nearby.
---
Then you can get fight against whatever they bring, so you’ll get more fights and have fun.
---
You’re too restricting yourself to little T1 frig in this very stacked game, when lots of people can afford faction frigs.
---
yeah but

Hardly. You don't seem to understand what I'm talking about.
---
How are they going to move my personal assets without me breaking EULA by account sharing?
---
I honestly just didnt play it beyond the first bit because it is a massive time investment, and not the fun kind that video games should be, from the way levels work to the way that it's free to play as f, to even how the market is run, this game is a slog. And through it all, I still have no idea what I was supposed to do, i bought ships cause people told me too, i mined cause people told me too. I mean, there is the quest system, which is in itself a boring slog.
---
In conclusion, it takes too long to do literally anything and as of such I'd rather play a game that respects my time.
---
I'm so confused with all these cynos.
---
So why would anyone now fit an industrial cyno in a blockade runner or DST.  I mean why.
---
Normal t1 will take you ages to get anywhere.  Blockade and DST that's a fucking expensive cyno and they are also long to train into.
---
I'm confused right now with this whole thing
---
You're just going on about extraneous stuff at this point, but haven't refuted the central premises of my strategy. See ya bud.
---
People do pilot their ship. This is how nanogangs work.
---
They don't think it be like it is, but it do... if you're in one of [five specific special shattered wormholes](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Drifters#Drifters_Wormhole_Systems). The number of wormholes spawning in these five systems has changed several times over the years, and is now *quite* high.

Hey that is some super flying. I do think they should move away from residential areas during exceptionally close proximity. Statistically, alone, I think that's not wise. Would it require just a wing tip touch or even a slight wind speed change to precipitate a fatal outcome? Im not completely sure. I think they should limit very very close proximity flying to non-residential areas, even if its a show.
---
And people will start crying that they took their way to express their opinion and emotions ... It's fine and kind of fun that way, so let it just be ...
---
its a fan club, you should sell them all hats
---
I agree. Too many people seem to assume that "new players don't stay because of X in null, or "titans" or "isk inflation" but people are not even aware of these things until they get immersed. 
---
I can see why people resist it, but the new player experience needs some more hand holding to show what's possible.
---
Hmmmmm I agree with some of what you’ve said but I feel there are other problems facing new players you haven’t mentioned.
---
I started playing about 2 years ago and have experienced being solo, being in a small Corp and am now currently in one of the largest alliances. I love this game and barely play anything else anymore but it has problems.
---
So from the perspective of a new player these are the things I think are wrong with the game:
---
1. Boring as fuck (depending on what you do): to be fair there is plenty to do that’s not boring but one of the simplest things a newbie can do to generate isk is mining. Mining is by far the worst grinding I’ve done in any game I’ve ever played. Worst than Diablo, worst than World of Warships/Tanks. I nearly quit the game because of it but then I learned about PI and SP farming and all was good. NPC agents are trash, nearly all of the PVE content is trash. The handful of friends I talked into playing walked away after a couple of weeks of this.
---
2. The endless alt accounts: not long after starting I watched a vid of a CCP dev talking about the multiple accounts he has to service a main, like this was normal. This was at EvE Vegas I think. Totally lame. So I thought. I now have 12 characters that essentially work to generate isk for my main or are deployed for specific tasks to support my main. Now I have to retrain my 2 cyno, PI, SP farm alts to cater for the new cyno changes, fml. To play at a certain level you need to commit serious amounts of time and effort. A new player can be disheartened by this.
---
3. PvE is trash: oh look, Drifters and Triglavian’s invade. Well, the Drifters were interesting but then they fucked off and nothing has changed. It all feels the same. Nothing changes. Empire borders don’t change. NPC space doesn’t mean crap all, except to allow people to dump caches of ships and equipment for their various sigs. FElW is interesting but ultimately means nothing on a galactic scale? Why can’t I fly through a system where there’s currently a battle between Gallente and Caldari forces? On a massive scale.
---
That’s all I can bring myself to write. I’ve lost feeling in my legs and my boss is probably wondering why I’ve been in the toilets for this long.
---
I don't think this a very good solution. 
---
Supposing I'm hit by a bus, it's not at all unreasonable for my phone to wrecked. 
---
And then assuming I get access to the internet another way, I have to 2FA on a new device. 
---
Assuming that's resolved and I can properly log in and submit a ticket, the ticket has to sit in the queue until investigated and actioned.
---
What happens if the following happens;
---
1. I submit a ticket, asking for a GM to push the button on my behalf, 
---
2. The day after that the structure is attacked, 
---
3. And subsequently destroyed, dropping all items not button pushed,
---
4. A GM finally gets the ticket, and discovers the button to push blew up a few days ago.
---
The GM going to say 'tough shit, we didn't get there fast enough.'
---
Let me know if I missed something.
---
well, it would truly be chaos, and Eve would likely draw a further crowd of spreadsheet geeks for a year or 2 who just want to play with said feature. It would also upset settled and growing player isk reserves... so not a bad idea.
---
That’s the fate of adult amongst children. You can never be sure that your words will not make them laugh like mad while you wondering what went wrong.
---
I know this feeling being team lead of group of 4 kids aged from 27 to 40.
---
I mean it's the best-case scenario for the jump freighter if it fails in best cause scenario we don't have to look at the other options. 
---
But your right that's a max skill full Istab fit.
---
Damn, that's a shame... Covert cyno for jump freighters felt so nice!
---
Ok, so we still have cyno fleets with industrials, which is ok I guess, but it only works on jumpfreighters so it will still be crippling. 
---
But I lold about the cyno vigils: "We understand that you want cyno vigils back, and we will give them to you! In the form of a slow moving T1 industrial..."
---
While less jumps will be a factor, I doubt this will address core issues which OP has described, namely everyone being buddy-buddy with everyone else, people having RL responsibilities that get in the way of sitting in a 14 hours long TiDi-fest etc.
---
&gt; And subsequently destroyed, dropping all items not button pushed,
---
remind me how long it takes to kill a structure in null. And remember no asset safety in wormholes.
---
Oh and lets not forget that your situation is a minority of a minority of cases. So few as to not be worth halting potentially helping to solve the stagnation problem threatening to kill the game.
---
If you were never claoked, mwding.
---
Id be on grid with you cloaked... waiting for the next one. When you light the cyno, ill move my probes over you. Thankfully because you were mwding, id be more tha  150km from you and aligned.
---
You lighting the cyno would appear on my over view, making me hyper alert. The jump freighter tearing space noise would trigger my probes
---
Id have your jfing in what 6 seconds?
---
We got rid of some.
---
While it is pretty close, since they are moving at the same velocity, touching or gusts wouldn't likely cause much issue.
---
These machines are pretty stable.
---
While maybe this isn't a perfect example think of what it takes for nascar crashes to occur. Its not the light side-to-side contact that causes the crashes. It's significant off line pressure.
---
It's to the benefit of actual players though.
---
If you were never cloaked, mwding.
---
Id have your jfing in what 6 seconds? Call it 10seconds because id probably be doing something stupid on my alt.
---
30 minutes?
---
I'd wait that out.
---
It's still easier to catch them now than before; now, once their :30 timer is past, they forget about you. Just sit and wait cloaked for a bit and get your free bot kills.
---
If you have manufacturing close to mids, its &lt;100m3 for compressed ore per indy.
---
Not really.
---
People said this would happen, and it has.
---
And people knew that.
---
The caveat is that they are still at greater risk than they were before and at greater cost.
---
Wow them numbers are really bad, its not like there is any other games that are 15 years old and attracting a mature audience right now. If something that a lot of the users would leave eve temporarily for it certainly would not of came out last night.
---
I think they're doing t deliberately - as in 'this is chaos'.
---
I thought this was Stellaris when scrolling down my feeds. Looks really good!
---
I chalk it up to you being old and cranky. Meanwhile I am farming salt by doing simple things like cutting the line.
---
Go to amamake only after a long fruitless roam when you’re desperate for some some explosion, even if it’s your own ship. Try finding a nice loop around the warzone and ideally fly something that can deal with the disadvantage of being the one that punches in. You should definitely get more than one fight per hour that way. If you can’t come up with a route yourself you can check out Jebi’s stream on Twitch (Evelog). He usually does exactly what I just described.
---
I audibly lol'd
---
Nothing wrong with that but that doesn't make you some kinda authority on how sov null should be balanced by CCP
---
Half this sub are getting off on shit changes because theyre that petty they just get off on others not enjoying the game.
---
 The other half are either concerned for the long term affects of the short sighted changes or are directly affected by them making the game not as fun as it was before.
---
... you realize with plummeting real player numbers, bots returning, and “only” the people who do nothing but small scale pvp celebrating that this won’t end well, right
---
You strike me as the sort of person who when he stubs his toe curses out "DAMN DIRTY BOTS"
---
Why is this only applicable to killing structures in null?
---
Taking away reasons to *come back* certainly threatens to kill the game as well. While it sounds like a minority of minority cases, CCP *is* worried that people losing all their shit while unavoidably away will cause people to quit permanently.
---
Fuck off with logic on this sub thats a capitol offense
---
Another post about the size of the player base at present. The only reasonable conclusion - at the moment - is that the 5 year downward trend continues. 
---
There's insufficient data on individual indicators such as: Black-out, SP event, individual changes, botting / RMT bans, ISK/bounty deltas. Some of those are good, some are bad in terms of increasing or decreasing playability or desirability. 
---
I think there's room for CCP to do better, I question whether Goons are objective about that at the moment given Mittens ranty rant about how inconvenienced he was at having to delay his war. Bit cringey.
---
Errm no thanks I have played the game  from the first year on and off over the last fifteen years although I enjoyed playing it is no where as good experience as now, despite it's current issues... just my opinion!
---
Citation needed on all 3.
---
And then also an explanation of the logic of the conclusion.
---
Yup the recent changes make eve more tedious in null, and force out players who just have a single account. Tedium should never be game design.
---
Yeah, I appreciate your comment. I also thought that even if it was just a touch it wouldnt precipitate a catastrophic event - IN THIS scenario... 
---
Its just that dem machines, well you only need 1 of a variety of factors to fail for said catastrophic event to become possible. Personally, on that basis alone Id move them away from residential areas.
---
Grab an upvote.         
---
I feel older that i am, still &lt;40, but when i play eve ... i cannot do any serious activity as i don't know when 'RL will call for me'            
---
While i was not injecting ^(except for a single char to fast move out a nyx - aka current HEL pilot) over the years i got a lot of assets.       
---
Funny is that it didn't relate to my farming ^(as i hate farming) but to changes CCP made.        
---
I was always to lazy to move stuff so at various points cans with stuff that i had spiked from like 300mil to 40bil and from a guy that could afford a dread i got to point where i will have stock of 3 titan hulls.            
---
But yeah i am riding on CCP bad decisions, i mined like 1bil in rorqual ^(because i had char with skills ... and recently actually wanted to see how the moon mining looks like to know how to hunt those guys),  and simply don't have much time to lose ships so i am just adding new hulls to my stock.                  
---
I agree that CCP decisions are bad. You need alts with recons ^(have 4 ready, 2 are lacking just cruiser V ... have recons already)   so this will be not such big issue for older players but just so harder to do stuff for newbies.                
---
Like i remember when i trained my cyno and lighted cyno for my alliance caps for the first time - was so proud.           
---
CCP is making EVE ... ugh ... well at least the addiction will die with the game.
---
Dude don't even try arguing with these guys they just get off on being big ol pussies complaining about the blob when their harmless pve target calls for back up but loving the blob when they can bully the smallest. 
---
The absolute irony that most of the people replying to you here are pro chaos era changes citing that it will fix stagnation and everyone against it is antiprogress yet will sit here and give you shit for wanting something that would make FW actually fun again
---
Abyssal pvp is for you then - 1x1 at quite significant price and risk.
---
the delay on zKB got removed weeks ago. It was just a Test.  
---
Squizz sayd its in Beta and a ongoing developemend. So i guess he will Implent all things step-by-step  
---
Good Work Squizz &lt;3
---
I have two subbed accounts with six trained characters in varrious states ranging from two million skill points to ninety million SP's. Out of these six I have two mains, one I use in 0.0 alliance warefare and the other main in faction warfare during the lull time in 0.0. The remaining four characters are used for roles such as cyno's alts, trade, industry, etc.
---
Contract your shit to your friends?
---
Oof sorry
---
Managing a corp or an alliance is a pain.
---
I can say it is the most boring thing that can burn you after the logistic role on those organisations. You know those people that run back and forth with their JF and their own cyno alt network because you don't trust anyone in EvE.
---
But as you said then you have to move to a place that they semi-automate the managing process with the use of 3rd party tools.
---
I would like to see a cap on corp and alliance members and reduce the standing list so you can't have a big blue list not even red.
---
I don't know if that will bring back more people but I believe EvE has started to decline from the time that you can "play" without even log into the game.
---
Yes try it why not, you may find being an 'alpha' state account might limit you in the future however at the start of your experience you will get a good taste or flavour of the Eve online.
---
my old friend.
---
How? I've been hit by a bus and stuck in hospital. 
---
^(read the comment you reply to next time.)
---
&gt; 1 of a variety of factors to fail for said catastrophic event to become possible.
---
Not really. It would take multiple.
---
Pretty sure the blue angles crafts are still fly-by-wire, so in the event the machine got bumped significantly, the computer would take over.
---
So then it would take multiple sensor failures.
---
Nomad + 3 faction inertias + Nomad implant set + 2 webs (from ur cyno ship) = enter warp in about 3-4 seconds.
---
&gt; less logistics strain
---
I think that the logistics aren't that difficult on a general thing.
---
It's more that if a corporation gets larger and larger with still only 1 dude handling logistics, that it gets crazy.
---
Individual logistical demands are still exceptionally low, so even if you just scaled up logistics in proportion to other operations, you'd be fine.
---
The overall gaming environment I think is a major point.
---
The core gameplay cycle isn't remotely engaging in EVE, and it's the depth that makes it good.
---
But people don't get that far because of the first part.
---
The game really needs a more engaging core gameplay cycle. IT doesn't need to be super ELITE or Star Citizen level, but at least as much as some other basic spaceship combat games (Surely eve can manage something as much as that Space Armada mobile game)
---
The depth will keep people, but the game is super inaccessible since the gameplay is boring and the ui is confusing.
---
But also, I don't think these changes are fixing symptoms of the game, they are fixing the causes. The symptom is big blue donuts. The cyno and black out are things putting pressure on those big blue donuts.
---
Good music choice.
---
Oh hi Vargurr
---
Some of it is just not really WANTING to.
---
Sometimes I just want ot pop on and do something.
---
EVE can be pretty bad for this, since most of the engaging stuff just doesn't happen on a whim.
---
Ummmmmm when 1000 + bots stop logging in you think it's not going to affect login numbers. All data has been screwed by bots for the past several years if you can't see that in the economic report.... well......
---
Oh yeah, same here. Ran a wormhole corp, passed the torch because of RL and took a "temporary" break that last for 5 years. I never would've won EVE if it had sucked my dick every now and then, that's for sure.
---
So uh, CCP... you know what to do.
---
And the bots just moved to low and hisec or stuck  cloaked ships on gates into their pockets. But you keep on with your scapegoat if it nakes you feel better about a dying game
---
They already are rotating even within the blocs. A good number of bloc corps ive seen are just rotating ceo every 3 months on a core of vets.
---
In my experience ive had the opportunity to director for a neutral group emulating horde model with about 60 active players in null. It was 25h of work per week. Not even in fleet. Every single one of the other directors and ceo (5 ppl all several years into eve) never logged back in after 5 months. Why? Because of domino burnout.
---
So the bloc main advantage is indeed linked to scale: just being able to take a guilt free week off your eve duties. 
---
Think about it as walking on ice: two points of contact and it breaks. Four and it holds. If a director is lost in a group with 10 its much less additional work than if youre only 3. So the real success factor of big blocs is their resilience to single people defection.
---
I live in a wormhole and I hunt all the time.. I guarantee you that there are people better that can and will fuck you
---
Oh did they..... And you know this because..... Eve has been dying for years so what's new?
---
Damn, that sucks. I probably took your stuff by then tbh
---
Because it takes only 2 braincells to figure it out. But whatever you must be a bot.
---
And the game has only got more tedious the more ccp changes the game.
---
Hey man, FFXIV's story may be garbage design, but it's a *special* kind of garbage. But yeah, it ain't going to merge with any other MMO well.
---
looks at isk made in a c5 in 2 hrs looks at what you said.. 
---
your point is?
---
I logged out to run to the store, came back realm said medium population. Go to login said I was 4693rd person in the queue and the wait was 71 mins. I thought wtf server popation said medium. The original release of wow I never remember queues that long.
---
Eve free to play is like a unlimited trial, keep that in mind.
---
There is still alot to do en explore the game mechanics while you're not subbed.
---
It is a good way to expierence and know if you like eve enough to sub some day.
---
Or half is angry their easy way of life that was unhealthy for the game is being changed.
---
The other half s concerned for the long term survival of the game and believes some significant changes need to be made to undo the damage caused by the last few years of changes only benefitting group 1.
---
Time-consuming? Yes, the deeper you go the worse it gets obviously, though you can stay casual. Worth it? Very much so.
---
Driving and using a cam or smartphone is not allowed over here....
---
You're up there with olmeca on disingenuity
---
I think there was several seasons of cat suit design that I do not regret.
---
I played on Merlin also but was Albion. Best pvp mmo ever.
---
Who cares ? I'm having fun. Imo Eve fun is not to crab 24/24 with no risk sorry
---
You are reffing clean IP's as "new IPs"... Why would anyone do that as that would be expensive. 
---
A Clean IP in terms of beating CCP Security, is just an IP that is not on the global recognised VPN list. e.g not being used by Cyber Ghost or tunnel Bear etc etc etc...
---
CCP look for commercial VPN's and update a host list. Naturally this helps defeat opportunists, but not the semi professionals ++
---
they have banned 13.000 accounts botting related in 2019
---
considering they did not catch all of em
---
when you ban one 2 more take it's place with modern automated botting creating algoritms
---
they are getting rid of them alright..... carebears and ratters that dont usually put money into the game and are burned out.
---
The only people that left are the real players bots don't leave, why should day? it's usuall business and looking at jita prices it's become more lucrative, PLEX has went down and there are less players to hunt them down that do than hunting now in the dark.
---
The small voices are right it's just a cashgrab
---
Adapt and overcome is rubish, not everyone has time and patience to gate 30 systems in search of content
---
Do you have information on Daily Active Users? 
---
I only have access to Peak Concurrent Users from eve-offline. Is there extra information available elsewhere?
---
And doing nothing risks killing the game entirely. Which is worse?
---
Contract it all to an alt, hell, use a new Alpha account if you must, never look at it again.  It'll always be there "if you need it".
---
I only have played in the last 7 years when I had loads of free time from unemployment, a job that allowed downtime and kept me at home at times, been unemployed or seriously sick and out of work for months.
---
lol
---
2 things to get around CCP. 
---
Hardware Masking
---
IP Masking
---
You can now bot without worry to your main accounts.
---
Serious question will the mining barges will be able to light the cynos?
---
mining is very entertaining profession
---
Hiting 1 dude in a week and hiting 90 dudes in week doesnt give you the same exact hit.
---
Not enough eye beams. Sylgar would not be pleased.
---
Weird challenge but GJ at doing it.
---
Bring back gong CCP please
---
As an EvE player. Ive got experience TZ tanking. So im an EU player on US servers to beat the mob area crouds!
---
The issue is more that finding a way out that leads to a wormhole nearby home takes some time
---
what the fuck
---
lol using a macro to smash that DSCAN and then complains that someone is cheating..
---
On a Monday night? That's more or less how it's been for years. In Fountain we'd rorqual mine all week from 6 to 10 am server time and literally nothing would fly through, but I didn't hear anyone complain about that on reddit.
---
yes, but the OP argues its pointless as within a few minutes they come back. Also by killing them you are just falling for a delay tactic so that the actual money making bot can get safe...
---
EVE is not a piloting game. You are supposed to command your ship, not pilot. That is a very important distinction.
---
Is the current gameplay less exciting than it could be? Yes. Would flying a battleship with a HOTAS be even more boring? Fuck yeah.
---
It is what it is - if the target notices on time, there isn't much you can do. Make sure you are as stealthy as possible before decloaking - that means removing probes from d-scan unless you're using them. One thing you can do against frigate explorers is to fit a bunch of smartbombs, then decloak right on top of them and volley them. SBs aren't affected by the targeting delay.
---
It actually lets you change skill queue? That's pretty impressive. 
---
Android when?
---
apple only at the moment ? don't see it on the real app store yet.
---
Yeah I just updated my skill queue from the app.
---
You can buy SKINs in the app. This is dangerous.
---
thats some dscan macro dude. is that even legal ?
---
That's rude dude, I was a CS player and I'm now playing Eve since 2017
---
Sorry I might be missing your point - you're saying you *do* have the time to take on these responsibilities?
---
Faction titans should have lots of particles in form of isk bills or mix of other currencies flying around their beams...
---
Wow classic had relatively great pve. Daoc had the pvp. There was nothing in Wow like the keep fights or emain style roams. The closest Wow had was the Tarren Mill(?) city stand off which was a bit like camping a portal keep in daoc eg go too close and the guards blap you.
---
Good idea to be honest. This is actually prety much like Elder Scrolls online map looks with the very centre being total deadzone with no rules whatsoever
---
When darkfall first released. 12h queues - never logout.
---
Some people are born beancounters and paper shufflers - they enjoy it :)
---
Honestly I just miss Vanilla's quirkiness. There was something wonderful about having a Barov peasant caller and a gnomish battle chicken and popping them once an hour made you feel POWERFUL because your DPS would go up 30% for a minute.
---
Looks like you missed the broadside of not one, but two barns.
---
You can trash it all from within the assets menu
---
1. The piloting is fine as-is. It's a game about being in command and seeing the big picture, it does NOT WORK with first person view and a flight stick.
---
2. With you on that one
---
3. Abyssal sites are a thing. They recently started including PvP arenas you can run. Expensive, yes, and risky, but a step towards what you describe.
---
It was a bank holiday in the UK. Fwiw.
---
Most people wouldn't, they'd just go and do something fun.
---
&gt;instanced
---
No. This would end tranforming EVE to WOW. Everything should happen in the open world, just give player a reason to meet and fight, and make the map smaller, New eden is too big
---
I would obviously come back. Then cloak up. Warp away. Find another safe spot to light my hypothetical covert cyno. Jump my JF in and align to gate all while laughing at how stupid you are. Then I'd warp off and jump the gate. You'd be feeling like a lost puppy.
---
I doubt it. But thanks for playing.
---
Looks like now, went to old app... Chose creator... Second app listed there :D
---
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ccpgames.eveportal2android
---
Actually this might be better test than without it. Bots are gone and you keep real people logging in, so you can estimate the number of bots you had
---
Not to mention Test, at its very beginning grew up in north (was it Deklein?) under the supervision of Goons as a sort of offshoot.
---
I mean honestly like the faction police are mostly a non-issue, you can generally avoid them relatively easily ( i warped battleships truth high-sec while being criminal ).
---
/me hot drops a freighter to save his barge ;)
---
It's legit how I play. I read about D-SCAN a year ago, been running data/relic, huffing gas, scouting and spamming V ever since.
---
&gt;it made it harder for me to at least make a decent amount of ISK in my limited free time due to the fact that it made subcap ratting riskier
---
Just go in WH, it's so empty and random so it's safe... Most of the time.
---
after spending so many years developing null as they did, now, after they got acquired by PA, they are out to get nullblocs. That sure is a change of gameplay, and PA is behind it and we know what PA is famous for. 
---
what bothers me more is they are dishonest about it
---
Ideally don't spend much time in bad systems like Sosala (always blobs, baits and overships like succubus is the default answer to a T1 frigate), Siseide (sit in a plex for 45 minutes with 50 people in local only to get backup blobbed by SOBR as soon as he realizes he's not going to win). Amamake is really hit or miss, depends on the time of day. The whole Eszur -&gt; Kurniainen -&gt; Sosala circuit is really dead these days as the frontline of the FW war has moved up north.
---
The best 1on1 systems are probably kamela, kourmonen, auga and huola to some extent. Lamaa is worth passing through and even sitting in sometimes.
---
Time of day due to TZ makes a big difference, there's almost no point trying to find pvp in the dead hours (peaking around 4 hours before downtime).
---
but the blackout killed all the bots
---
never, since ccp is trying really hard to burn eve down
---
You can find the same bots in Aridia low sec operated by a certain low sec russian group.
---
Only CCP can fix botting.
---
Yeah don't get me wrong, we've lost a lot of the fun weirdness over the years, but a lot of that has come about as a result of carving out huge tedium from the gameplay loop. 
---
One of the things I miss the most was the hilarious engineering stuff. Gnomish in particular, even though big booms could be fun too. High risk, high reward dice rolls there, and it really heightened the fun of PvP in particular. 
---
World PvP was another amazing part of WoW back in the day that has pretty much died too. 
---
Vanilla had its perks. It's just that a lot of those grew tedious over time, and mostly shine in rosy nostalgia goggles more than reality.
---
I honestly have no idea what just happened &gt;.&gt;
---
its not in all apple stores yet every store in every country is not the same as the other it will take a few days / weeks for this for those that wonder US is most time a head of all others
---
Pixel 3a here, iam being told to fuckoff as well
---
The only bad thing about that number is that one of them was you.
---
Don't worry, you're right. 
---
The game can be extremely pretty. In this case however it looks like shite.
---
i imagine literally in space
---
sad but true. gottem
---
if only. too bad eve peaks at like 5k now? maybe 20 when stars allignn
---
And how the fuck are you supposed to do nullsec logistics - or anything more than a gate or two deep into LS - with a T1 industrial as a cyno. That's moronic.
---
Hi. I do alliance logistics sometimes when I'm not too busy on KSP. This is still missing something really important: an option for capital logistics (just moving from Point A to Point B, usually from buy location -&gt; staging) on a small scale without spending huge amounts of isk. 
---
**WHAT I PROPOSE: make "industrial cynos" an option for all capitals, but if you jump anything other than a JF to it, it offlines all your modules** so you can't combat-drop with it; you can only move around. 
---
Optionally, double jump fatigue so it's a profoundly shit option unless your goal is to minimize effort. 
---
WHAT THIS WOULD DO: I could still buy a cap in Rakapas and jump it to Villasen to fit up and hand out to corp for a fleet. 
---
WHY THIS MATTERS: Lots of small-alliance types buy caps off the local market, then jump them to staging and fit them up. We'd like to keep doing this without needing high-effort protected moveops on a regular basis. It's actually really great if people can do this on their own and be basically independent, since it frees up people like me to plan fleets or Duna missions. 
---
This would make it a lot more manageable for anyone who does solo/smallscale cap pvp or logistics to move and stage stuff, which is great because it lets us get to the content without having to put tons of extra work into setup.
---
What if I'm botting
---
Iww come to tawk to you awain uwu
---
Is this the new 4-4?
---
I like puppies... innocent and cute.
---
But GF good sir. You got away. 
---
I killed the next JF that tried.
---
your brain is dying
---
There is also a chance, based on how large the playerbase is, that a non-commercial IP is stuck on a blacklist already from a previous "customer". For something as big as WOW, for instance, it's significant, as many of these teams are fairly liberal in their IP bans and don't really care if they are getting collateral damage.
---
&gt; Nullbears
---
&gt;net PvP loss
---
Pretty sure Nullbears will be happy about this way more than 'lol u angry'
---
OMG That was the funniest 3 mins of my day Im not really Shocked
---
Because the bar keeps getting higher and higher. 
---
The forced shutdown of the API system was a REAL big problem for small to midsize Corps.
---
Corps who had a developer and actual server infrastructure got a lot of benefits out of the new system. 
---
Corps who used 3rd party tools to manage applications and Corp members got screwed. 
---
The ESI system also handles errors in the most stupid way possible.
---
Say you request 10 attributes of a character, but one of them is no longer valid (because CCP Changed a way a value is handled). Most systems would return a N/A or Null value, and give the 9 actually valid attributes. The ESI system says "Something's Wrong. Try again in 60 minutes" and returns ONLY that.  You don't know what's wrong, only that something is wrong. 
---
Due to how the ESI stores cashed values, you basically need to wait 60 minutes to get an actual attempt again as well.
---
I can't imagine a dumber way to handle errors like that, that doesnt involve the server trying to send you an electric shock if you ask for it wrong.
---
They are almost all on HS space, you just need to plan the hauling route. Good luck
---
If there is no statistical significance test, then to the trash it goes.
---
agree daoc is still the best :(, warhammer online was okish but rubbish mechanics and gw2 wvw ended in people stay in each other and nuke the other blob totally shitty gamestyle. Sadly teso never caught me much. Mythic creates a new MMO atm a true daoc 2.
---
&gt;  ... KSP2, games that do not require you to sink a lot of time into it. ...
---
KSP2 is not yet a thing and to get good at it one can and will sink a massive amount into it ( at least if it will be like the first game)
---
I still stand by the opinion that WotLK was the pinnacle moment for wow. It had a good amount of QoL improvements, pvp was at it's best imo, good content and all the quirkiness that made wow fun. Also you can correlate it to the fact it saw the most subscribers ever. I think until now with classic maybe, it hadn't been beat. I mean it wasn't perfect but you had arenas, great story, amazing raids (except for ToC), and the first time we saw guilds compete for world first Lich King kill, if you're into that sorta thing. It was pretty hype and amazing to watch looking back on it. Funny enough and conversely I could have cared less about the recent race to kill a content boss. Story? Challenge? Pacing? It's so carrot on a stick. 
---
Once LFG and the test phases of LFR came through during wrath, it was a sign of things to come, and it's been downhill since.
---
You upvote those that want it removed* ?
---
&gt; They wont though, because the same thing happened with Aegis sov. They got their wish list almost to a T, and afterwards people hated it.
---
I would like to point out that people didn't want "Aegis sov". They wanted occupation-based sov, meaning that arbitrary stuff like physical flags with timers and shit should go completely. Instead people were given same shit, but with sovlaser instead of guns, a lot more targets to sovlaser and extra grind associated with entire system.
---
Maybe you could argue that specific wishes formulated by some people were granted, like scattering points of interest across space, but in general Aegis sov was actually very much against what people wanted, which was killing other players' stuff and moving in being enough to be considered an owner.
---
You further that many if the players like these changes.
---
i remember how the dev's of WoW tried to cater for Daoc players with promises etc. Still today daoc Housing &gt; WoW Housing lol. And don't let me start on keepfights, repping chains, sieges. And the all mighty FFA Dungeon Darkness Falls and the epic shit you could do there while hiding etc. I played as Infiltrator and as Animist and as Shaman. Full 3 Realm Experience ftw :P
---
I noticed no one replied to this so I thought I'd take a crack at it.
---
You mention how other games _claim_ to be sandboxes. Eve _actually is_.  One of the key components about Eve is picking a goal and then the core gameplay loop evolves around that. For many people, it's "get a battleship" or "get a billion isk".  Those are pretty standard first goals to get to where you'll see real actual progress. But because Eve really _is_ sandboxy, your goal(s) will change and the core gameplay loop(s) will as well. After some time you may end up with a group (and it doesn't need to be a large one) that has a goal of "holding a system", even if it's a highsec or lowsec or NPC  null or WH system where you don't get your  name in the top left. Maybe your goal becomes getting a rank on zkill, or so much isk destroyed or the achievements squizz made. Maybe your goal becomes to _produce_ battleships instead of just buying one, and to take over a market segment.
---
All of those things I listed above _each has a core gameplay loop_, many entirely distinct from the others. Eve's problem isn't a lack of a core gameplay loops, it's  showing people (such as yourself) the multitude of loops, and explaining how _each one_ is a perfectly valid and fine thing. It's a variety show, there's no headliner.
---
Exploring the universe and beating whatever obstacles are in your way is the heart of Eve.  But there's a lot of universe to explore, so you need to pick where you're gonna start.
---
Honestly just find a corp that's active in your TZ and you're set. You can join a power bloc if you want but there may or may not be fleets in your timezone and they may or may not usually be extremely boring structure grinds on a regular basis.  
---
Depending on what you want to do - if PvP is what you're after, find a corp specifically doing that and have some fun.
---
Tribute and Vale are mostly being used by goons right now as farm grounds, the fact that somebody else their flag is on the map really doesn't matter all that much when your fun roam is 250 jackdaws ( like no small gang is gonna fight that ).
---
The idea that your just one conflict driver away from this massive war is bullshit, you had a highsec conflict between horde test and goons you all choose to end that via Diplo.
---
Now there is also the issue of no eve war ever truly being about resources.
---
Skyrim and the witcher series were pretty successful as well and are long playtime games. Granted you don't have the same actual cost (monthly sub) or time cost/pay to skip of training times to contend with if you want to get the biggest/best things. Can't think of a successful game with a similar skill system to eve, and that's been the biggest reason most of the gamers I know haven't been interested even if they had more than enough playtime every day.
---
Industrials bud.        
---
Curent cyno ship takes like 500m3? T1 industrial 20.000 m3.         
---
So if you want to move 5 cyno ships worth like 5mil ISK ... you need to use 100.000 m3 out of like 320.000 m3 you have in your Jump Freighter.           
---
The best example that CCP don't play EVE as they don't know about such obvious things.
---
Hard to read with the font size changes, but you say you need alts with recons, which is hard for new players? why are new players in caps that they need to move solo, why aren't they using their alliance and corp mates to help them, much like you remembered how proud you were helping your friends out with their move?
---
WoW Classic can't get me i was lucky back then and i got a spot as Druid (Alliance) for the fine raids. We finished Naxx back then, the hell i play that game again and need to skill 3 different path to be a healer or 3 rd tank.
---
There are a few faction warfare alliances left that sort of do things and might be able to teach you the ropes. Eve University I'm sure still does things. You could potentially join a Nullsec alliance, but be warned you may get lost in the crowd and it might be harder for you to pick up the nuances of PvP. Honestly just find a group that's active in your timezone and learn whatever you can - even if they're shit at the game. Have fun dying and figuring out how to die less.
---
Same during the bag8 "content astra" end of july, we put everyone on the same channel 2 minutes before the undocking, everything suddenly went blank.
---
It was a bit awkward
---
Give it a try, see what you prefer doing, figure out if it's too time-consuming for you.
---
Aside from time you will spend doing that, trying the game out is free.
---
Otherwise it's a bit hard to tell since the game still offers very variable experience depending on what you expect and what you prefer.
---
&gt; s. I thought it would always be awesome if EVE had a Gladiator kind of arena system, new guy can grab a ship and do something immediately with someone his own level 
---
That's the cool thing about Eve, nothing stopping you from just setting something like this up on your own.
---
You (the general "you, not the specific) keep saying that the large blocs are nearly unbeatable and can't be challenged.
---
What's stopping one of these blocs from arranging something like this? It'd be trivially easy for them to fund hundreds or thousands of fully fitted T1 frigs, dessies and crusiers (probably even battleships). Likewise it would likely be trivially easy for them to fully secure a chunk of Empire-adjecent (to keep travel times down) null and hold open invitations. They could even payout cool prizes for winning. 
---
Invite the newbies to come, stream it.

You guys missed every single one of those shots on us and we didn’t even boosh, you all saved the roq but like the amount of sabers and dd’s worth of Isk you spent to keep us from killing the roq is worth more than the roq you guys saved lol

This is basically the point of the corp I've been conceptualizing. Look up  v o i d - g a t e  in game and read the corp details (they are just conceptual and are subject to change as needed) Let me know (char: Noxi Void) if you'd be into contributing to a group like this.
---
They also don't have the same price structure. Most strategy/rts games are pay once play forever, while eve is pay forever play sometimes. how many of those EU4 players would prefer the experience of having paid 720+ dollars from 2013 instead of 60 and playing when they feel like it? Even buying every expansion for hearts of iron puts it at less than a year of eve, and probably more varied content.
---
More people play and log into individual WoW servers than the entirety of eve lmao...
---
TLDR: Another one of 99999999999 posts about "Eve is dying" but this time talking about cynos. 
---
In 3 months we'll see more posts about "Eve is dying" but featuring some other reason. :D
---
You can buy anything in the nes on the app
---
... pretty much. I can't find any real fault with any of that. The game really hit its stride in that expansion, and had amazing story moments like Wrathgate etc. 
---
Of course, it also doubled down on the dailies thing which was a personal bugbear issue. I hate it when games try to manipulate me by adding fucking *chores*. Especially when they also make those chores the *only* progress path for reputation rewards, etc. 
---
Grinds are evil on their own, but at least let me turbogrind what I want by tryharding over a few days rather than making me do the same damn thing every single day for months on end. 
---
Chores and log-in rewards are frankly vile artifacts of the MMO genre, as far as I'm concerned.
---
Your suggestion literally is the existing probe mechanic.

I'd rather believe CCP couldn't fix their chat so they disabled it rather than this.

I know this is just a very particular situation but, Ima lay it out nonetheless maybe some more align to it.   
---
For me eve started in 2006 and have been playing on and off since then (just to set the context).I'm near 40 yo now, kid and wife the whole thing. I can play for much less time however eve still caters. What i've found doable so far:  
---
1. I play in whs (no need for stratops and not watching your assets 24/7) 
---
2. I am part of a small corp of like-minded and about the same age people who understand the issues and have some of their own
---
3. I have some alts on which i run solo activities or things that I can get involved pretty quick - exploration, ded site running, abyssal, mining etc.
---
4. Most importantly : I guard my playtime - even if we're in a fleet, i try not to play more than 2 hours per day when I get the chance - we would get in, get to looking for content in whs for about one hour, if it works out, fine - if not we get to play something else or whatever.   
---
What i'm getting at is that 
---
a) there are ways to play eve if you don't plan to actually make your life out of it, and treat it like a game (would you spent 6 hours per day to play civ, every day? guess not) 
---
b) eves offline training queue caters to playing when you want (other mmos require action to progress character) 
---
c) eve has places where you can just get some of that sweet spaceship slow game going (which are not pvp) if you like that
---
d) it's just a matter of focusing on what you can get, given your circumstances
---
I'm still having fun   
---
o7
---
Imho, as op said, there needs to a viable option, and a role, for people who need to do a quick pickup game, either pve or PvP.
---
My suggestions, burn it all down - even more than CCP has already done. If people are going to cooperate anyways, make their survival contingent on it and resources super scarce. Turn it into a zombie apocalypse scenario where small pockets of players survive against pressure from the big bad. Make it so a single frigate finding a safe route from a to b, in their exploration frigate, a big deal. If an unstealthed ship gets spotted, have ever increasing waves of enemies swarm in - you're going to mine, you're going to have to hire people to defend you for every turn then run. Give the players a safe zone of wormholes that they can move around and engage in PvP without getting squished like bugs, but, make them totally bare of resources, so that a new player huffing in a frigate's load of gas then running, is a meaningful contribution.
---
In other words, enforce a brutal resource scarcity and increase the value of any pilot. Let, causal players automagically beam into a corps "Merc" hub, where they can take on missions to deliver X amount of material, or courier something from a to b. Jobs that can be done in a low tier, semi disposable ship provided by the corp. But, make those ships the only ones that are easy and inexpensive to produce. After that, they can work up to something more challenging like pathfinder missions in a "relic" astero that can no longer be easily produced and is a very limited resource. My 2c.
---
I used to play a lot till about 2016 (when test was evacuating wicked creek,) until I found myself annoyed with one of my kids because their demands were interfering with my op schedule. That's when I uninstalled the game... would totally jump back into a version that offered an option for pickup play.
---
Just tried it on Android. It works fine. I updated my skill queue from work. You can't do much on the app yet but it's a good start. (Ofc you can buy skins !)
---
I'm very late to this party but I want to bring up one thing that you sort of touched on indirectly: the world has moved on. So many things are just _easier_ now. Anyone can have voice comms for free with Discord. $5/mo VPS will get you forums, and SeAT/Allianceauth will get you a full range of services (for free!), with clear instructions on how to set them up. And there are legions of people with the experience to do this. None of this _existed_  15 years ago. Shared hosting was crappy and/or expensive. There  was a few orders of magnitude less folks with experience with these software products. Apache wasn't even  10 years old and Nginx didn't  _exist_ when Eve was released. Wikipedia had barely broken out of its infancy. Now you can make your own wikia in seconds and everyone knows how to edit them. Automated tooling with free SaaS products makes things easier.
---
All of this tech (and the capacity to use it, cheaply and well) has had a huge impact on Eve. You touched on this as well, but a great deal of what drives conflict is information asymmetry. You don't know something, so you commit to a fight or a conflict that maybe you  wouldn't  have otherwise. But with all of that tech talked about above, you know _everything_. And you know _everyone_. It's hard to _avoid_ knowing people on the other side of the conflict and you talk and narratives get despun and you know damn well if you won that fight or not you can look it up on zkillboard, the impartial arbiter of (isk) victory. I don't think this is a fault of Eve, and I really don't know how you'd solve it. I've been mulling it over for a few years now and have no good ideas. It's certainly not specific to Eve though -- for longer than Eve has existed, _Diplomacy_ players took to playing "gunboat" Diplomacy where identities were hidden from all but the GM, because people would know names and formulate strategies based on that, rather than the actual work at hand.
---
To sum up the rambling above, information asymmetry drives  conflict more than anything else, especially at the local level. But we live in the information age. Keeping things unknown is _very_ hard, and players have incredible tools to get around it now, which CCP can't do a damn thing about.
---
Even from the gameplay trailer from some months ago it was obvious fitting and ship control are different from the main game
---
I mean my new vitalshift skin for the eagle is easily the prettiest ship in the game for me right now. The color changes and all that just looks so nice
---
Prove they're breaking it.
---
All they are doing is exactly what you told them to: put alts on gates.
---
Fuck yes, burn new eden to the ground and let the smaller player base fight over what ashes and embers remain.
---
So its live?
---
If not "I only play games that exist"
---
related: ck players \*have\*probably played upwards of a few hundred buck on expansions/dlcs from 2013 onward, but I get your point :P
---
There's a ton you can do in alpha, and a ton you can't. If you are happy with the tools you have  then just stay alpha. Join a group of other players who can provide the things you can't and you'll never notice the limitations of alpha state as a negative.
---
ahh... the skin! :-)
---
Yes Machs but the point being that this was their latest one and we have been asking for years for them to be allowed to sell us them!
---
Never getting that gate cocksucker.
---
Yes and no. The issue has multiple factors. I stopped playing in null-sec blocks because I couldn't get arsed anymore to stay behind a Titan waiting for Goons/NCPL/Darkness/Whoever (pick whatever baddy you want) to make a move they will never make because blue balls. So basically the idea is good for small scale engagement, while it won't necessarily change the situation for large scale engagements where blue balls will still be blue balls.
---
Yeah fair enough, likewise mate.
---
Which country are you in? Deffo not on Play store in UK
---
Well I like the moa/eagle type ships aswell :p but the new vitalshift skins specifically make them look really nice
---
in a videogame yes
---
Ran a small fw corp for a few years who were reasonably sucessful within our own niche.
---
Many changes were made over the last few years that made maintaining our playstyle too much hard work and loggin in became a chore.
---
Years of skill training, effort and cost(ISK and $$) wasted by CCP. We had put in the hard work only to be fucked over time and time again.
---
I'd never go to the effort of building up a corp again.
---
This is why so many people are happy to sit back and watch all the groups who pushed for the changes that ruined small gang pvp get a taste of their own medicine with the blackout/drifter stuff.
---
Lots of people are fine with EVE dying  - I suspect many are playing until the last hoorah just so they can say 'I was there'.

With eve actually dead what will you play?   
---
Serious question.

Someone tag a ccp employee on this. That's actually an amazing idea, instead of having tht great systems on the edge of the map, have them dead center for competition. Really cool idea.

Dude, just...stop. You used to be mildly funny, now you're just sad. Your daily thousand-word rambles aren't providing any real benefit to anyone. Go back to bitching about lowsec connections to Stain.

---
Too fucking true. 
---
 Wrathgate, uldur, alexstraza. As well as amazing zones that were also _designed_ around flying mounts showed real artistic direction. Those leveling zones and raids are unforgetable. 
---
I remember doing a weekly and a few daily quests. I never felt required to do too many or anything that wasn't enjoyable I'd say. Except for the shoulder enchant rep grind. Either way as daily quests suck, I felt it was manageable. Weekly quests were the most important and you could technically ignore almost everything else IIRC. 
---
This brings up the reason I absolutely despise retail wow currently. World quests are nice in theory for end game content but having over 100 daily quests is so ridiculous. Add in the dozen more weekly objectives like each tier of each raid and so on.  When BFA launched everyone raced to do every damn one of those world quests, just to do them again the next day. How masochistic can you get. I suffered greatly in terms of gear, ilvl progression, for my sanity. Everyone said "gotta do those WQ's man, gotta level that azerite necklace". Fuck.. That.
---
Sounds like you need to stop crying and find yourself a new game to play already. The issue with EVE isn't the game itself, it's the player base. They are the ones that have caused the problems and essentially ruined the game. The game used to be about great wars and fun. Now you Null Suck kids have gone with diplomacy and making coin instead of doing anything. "We agree to stay in our own space and not invade the space of others". Sissy girls. You want to make it fun again go and take downa large alliance.
---
You are correct. it's extremely hard to take away something sweet without angering the playerbase but not impossible imo.
---
I thing multiple small changes with some time in between would have been better...
---
Or if they must be big and radical do them one at a time with tweaks afterwards. Not just dumping a pile of shit and saying HTFU.
---
Best advise here. My Corp usually has around 20 people online but we are always doing things together. Joining a large group makes it very difficult to really get to know people.
---
No thanks.

This is also why ppl reeing about EVE dieing based on player count dips is ridiculous. As CCP has said there's much more important metrics than player count and this post proves it.

They should just add a frigate hull to the hauler line, make it a modified venture convert the ore hold to ozone and let it fit the new freighter cyno, problem solved.

I think also the endless scalability of grindy income with time is something that should be looked at.  Unfortunately I get that in a game that allows infinite alts it's going to be harder to pull off.

2h can also be plenty in WH for pvp. Depending on how quickly you get a good connection.

Wait wait, lemme just: "Only CCP can kill Eve" XD
---
I play both too. It Is nice to have a game with just play and some goals on the horizon, some things you MIGHT feel like doing today... nothing set in stone.
---
ok, so good job ccp?
---
Stop being so fucking stupid, it's starting to get depressing.
---
Yes, there's Already a thread about it.
---
Oh sorry
---
Those two sides you speak of are only in your mind... well, and in that koolaid bottle you've been drinking.
---
Just let it happen.
---
So, the main impression I am getting from reading this thread is that a lot of the blame for "the lack of things to do" in Eve seems to stem from people blaming the large null blocs for being responsible for massive stagnation in Eve.
---
To a certain degree I agree with this, though I have never been a big 0.0 guy so I honestly don't know nor care too much about the large blocs. The thing that strikes me is that you seem to be expecting CCP to be the ones responsible for creating the content for you to consume.
---
This, I guess is a pretty logical stance to take, CCP is the developer after all. That said, Eve's charm and draw has always been the fact it's a huge sandbox where the players are free to do whatever they want. There is nothing stopping the large null blocs from providing a lot of the content people are asking for - there is nothing stopping Goons or TEST (or whoever the fuck) from arranging PvP tournies available to newer players or any other sort of content.
---
The blocs just seem unwilling to do so, which to some degree is the fault of the members of those groups. Nothing is stopping you (the members) from suggesting and pushing for your bloc to do content that would be more inclusive to newer players. For example, the most fun I have had recently has been with the WarpToMe incursion community. True it's not the most exciting content in the whole world, but it is open and it is reasonably available to new(ish) players; what is stopping TEST or Goons from doing similar things? Or from doing other, more approchable content?
---
Another thing I have noticed is the complete lack of any options for asymmetric warfare. History is full of stories of small, highly mobile and highly organized groups taking on larger groups (See Afghan Insurgency in the 80ies and 2000s, the European resitance duing WW2 or the IRA in Ireland ). Sure you cannot win, but you can totally drive a truck bomb into a strategic position or run demoralizing campaigns of attrition.
---
This, simply is not an option in Eve. There is no way for a small group (however organized) to effectively hurt a large bloc, their power comes from their structures and their immense fleets of capitals, and there simply is no way for a group of unequal size to take on something like that. It is not like you can load up a Typhoon with explosives and bump a moon drill to death.
---
No clue how to fix this issue.
---
it is.
---
I searched for eve portal and it came back with the old one
---
I love atticus i am gay for atticus
---
If you have another account, use an inty or a sabre, 
---
The bomber is a good option as well if solo ganking for T1 explorer.
---
I just googled that, answer lies somewhere in old forums:)
---
i think if there s a will there s a way with that guerilla warfare. Bombers bar does it, wingspan did it, olmeca did it and a lot of cloaky campers did it too. 
---
if these efforts would be focused and people would actually care to do them, they would hurt the larger blocs.
---
&gt; Not to mention that this is the worst way of doing business, like ever.
---
Nope. Every software product has a lifecycle. Some outlast their expected end. Others are dogs that die pretty quickly. All of them eventually will go away. Not being able to face that is cowardly.
---
As for it being terrible business, the truth is a company that doesn't create new software to replace old is not doing a good job of running their business. CCP might already have closed Eve down except their other attempts fell flat. In the end, the only good decision was to sell off their product to someone who will rake in as much money as possible in the game's twilight and then use the purchased IP to build something new.
---
I am not saying I WANT Eve to die. I am saying it must end as all things are wont to do. That might be as early as this October or it might be five years from now. You need to accept that.

I, too, have been on fleets which have encountered WAFFLES, Fweddit, and various other groups like that. It generally hasn't gone well for my brawlers, but you don't see me whining.
---
&gt;Cloack nerf when?
---
There's really no good reason. You have time to either warp off or call for help before it can target you unless it's a bomber (and those are untanked enough that if you look at it after you get a lock, it will explode). And this would ruin wormholes worse than people are implausibly claiming that the Blackout did to Null because it would needlessly overburden scanning ships.
---
Upvoted! Played 14 years this game but now it s empty. It was so good. Like it much more than eve because you didnt need to do pve to do pvp.
---
They didnt listen to costumer and now we are all gone. Like it s going to be in eve.
---
&gt; it is extremely likely you will die
---
God, this IS a great time to be playing!
---
And you're right. I've lost a couple of PVE ships since it started. That's what happens when you undock; you risk being killed.
---
Embrace it, dude! Then go out and kill something! :)
---
Or just include noobships or T1 frigates.
---
&gt;Even if you're ping-warrioring, having content served to you on demand, it takes a SIGNIFICANT amount of time to play. 
---
Can you expand a bit on why that is? Works fine in my experience.
---
I dont pvp sorry, only run 200 bot rorquals under the umbrella.
---
remove the information apis endpoints so we dont get system indexes anymore via web, in fact remove all but personal/corp info and have killmails only show what dropped, not what was destroyed.
---
I lost a 2 bil machariel to 5 claws (interceptors). It only happen once, then you learn.
---
But what about the people that need to light cyno vigils? Have you even considered their gameplay?
---
have ore anomalies spawn rats continously that will incentivize the presence of a guard fleet.
---
it's still in closed beta. I've been a backer since the beginning (DAoC fan) and I've once or twice installed and logged in to the beta but frankly I'd rather just wait for the finished product.
---
It's an honest, no bullshit, no p2w, RVR MMO that does things the old school way. DAoC should have been the template for new MMO's, not WOW.
---
Actually, these bots where there before and just needed local
---
&gt;You have time to either warp off or call for help before it can target you unless it's a bomber (and those are untanked enough that if you look at it after you get a lock, it will explode).
---
This is the case on paper but not really in practice. In practice, dealing with getting dropped on by a bomber fleet is frustrating. Any halfway-competent FC is able to pick targets they know they can beat, while avoiding targets they aren't sure about. Bombers are pretty much untouchable while staging for a drop and immediately after their target is dead, and even a small (ca. 10-15 man) bomber fleet against the right targets can kill the target before the target can do anything. The local changes made the bombing playstyle a little too strong IMO, and this comes from someone who enjoys being in bomber fleets.
---
What do you define as 'harder'?
---
oh so someone jumped to someone else cyno - unbelievable to newer folk how can that be :)))
---
To say 1.5bill/hour farming is risk free is silly. You run the risk of dying the moment you land in a site, even with the best setup, a well prepared group will kill you.
---
i did find it interesting that the most production is done in jita, which is shocking considering how much more expensive it is to do so.
---
Sure, you can do hit'n'run sneaky PvP with bombers and other cloakies. But can you make a serious impact on the bloc's actual power? You can get some kills sure, but can you actually **hurt** Goons or TEST this way?
---
I’m still here
---
Wut? Last time I logged on was a while agi and on average it was 20k logged at all times. What happened?
---
Nice.
---
yea to add i would want to point out thay eve came about around the same time wow did - wow ramped up to some million ccu, eve peaked at 63k. 
---
so it wasnt a mainstream game then and it isnt one now, that's not an issue.
---
Eh, I’d love to finish a drifter hive site one day.
---
as usual garreth your too dumb to see the point.
---
infact you actually just agreed with me in a way. your saying to not pressure any sov nullsec to live how we want it to be, ie: your saying its a sandbox.
---
well, you should not enforce YOUR way on others like you are, thats what the battlefield is for. Main goal of players in nullsec are all slightly different. but im sure theres way more after the pvp side of things like ive said i want, thatn people out to dominate.
---
those who want to dominate tend to live in lowsec because their group is too small to do anything worthwhile.
---
And a rollercoaster of training plans.  I've gotta go switch all my accounts off of trying to quickly train into covops.
---
To be fair, I skim read them so when I go looking for the gold in comments section I have a point of reference for the best bits.
---
and it happens - what we see here is bitter old vets clutching at their playstyle and assets
---
I do for lots of threads. Not SG’s though. It’s either a low effort shit post of crying for the poor goonies.
---
The cyno changes are only tedious to you because cyno allowing cheap and instant travel for whole fleets was incredibly broken.
---
still how often do you have to pay more than 100mil?
---
Have you got any shred of proof behind the botting statement?
---
You still havent stopped the massive isk faucet that is WHs. Or any of the other endless farming things.
---
But I replied to your statement of the game being better and more fun. People dont tend to stop using products if they get better.
---
We can do it. We just need ccp to give us the tools to do so gradually. Resource scarcity would be a good start imo.
---
Doesn’t someone broadcasting a corp/alliance fleet in the fleet window do 90% of what you need?
---
I still hope that this game will end with a great re-exodus through EVE gate or some other superwormhole into EVE 2.
---
in ratting,
---
the extra 20dps you get after having those skilled to level 5, then gets multiplied by the amount of DDA;s you have, and then every single second of your ratting FOREVER makes you more money.
---
in PVP
---
i can assure you, each little skill matters, local tanks in cruiser and below in this game are super balanced IMO. and missing a level 4 or 5 skill in something your flying can mean the difference of putting enough pressure on your opponent to break his tank, cause him to make mistakes etc.
---
if your doing something you should have those skills up, the one skill personally  have delayed is each gun's specialization skill to 5. this is something i will change, but because i fly with all different weapon types having ALL those to 4 benefits me better. i do ant them to level5  though, and plan to add them all after my current 200day queue lol
---
That is why I recommend frigate and small gang PvP to new players. Because if you just align/approach/orbit and turn on guns you will get wrecked.
---
You are being captain obvious here. Im saying we dont need to rush it towards its inevitable death. With the right approach this game got more than a few years left in it. But losing tons of subs isnt the way.
---
So lets say I send you a mail right now with a link to the fleet im in, the second down time rolls around and I have to make the fleet again that link I sent you no longer works, with the system i propose above, it would..
---
I did say its an edge case thing, but there would deff be some people who would use it.
---
There are no other games, only Eve.
---
" our saying to not pressure any sov nullsec to live how we want it to be,  "  
---
No what I said is you are full of shit and have no idea what sov null was made for.  
---
"those who want to dominate tend to live in lowsec because their group is too small to do anything worthwhile." That's why NC, Goons, Snuff, Test and Horde all have nullsec sov......
---
Yeah, i know that. I did some iskies in a dual C3, many years ago. 
---
Then i had a "hotdrop" on my knee
---
Yes CCP also this is actually also CCP response for the memorial cyno.     
---
No vigils but industrial ships from now on.
---
Yea, so, who’s in charge of the fleet of the boss that made it’s gone?
---
What if I don’t want to be in fleet because I have work to do in station?
---
 Online:20000 + new app,eve online :5000
---
But we are not discussing what nullsec was MADE for, we were discussing what keeps people in nullsec
---
In fairness though the default overview and UI settings are absolute trash. They really should incorporate a better default that is more intuitive.
---
You do realise that to get the 1.5b/hr you need to be using a dread, where you're sieged for 5 minutes at a time. If someone rolls into you, you're pretty much done.
---
Yes it has higher reward, but also higher risk, we can sit in a carrier aligned to a atructure.
---
Players are terrible at game design.
---
Sometimes we can catch problems.  Sometimes individuals can have good ideas.  But groups tend to be absolutely awful at it.
---
Sure! But it s good for noob or vet that need to train a fucking long skill. I like free SP.
---
1) massively devalued SP
---
2) all present safety, incl. all the nullified crap
---
3) lack of conflict due to di-/monopol of force and blob of titans
---
4) bots
---
fuck this game.
---
Alright, back to PC I go.
---
if you don't wana be in fleet don't join it ? not sure what your asking here sorry.
---
Enemies can only bring 3 capitals but in your home you can bring many like 30 dreds
---
Andrei Vassaliev ?
---
more titan / super / FAX. there has to be a top.
---
i wish the tech tree did not stop at titan. it meant goons caught up with everyone on titan numbers. as no more progression could be made. too late now though
---
sry replied to the wrong post
---
As if.
---
You chose a one-sided perspective.
---
I pointed out that there is a mirror position to that.
---
If you take issue with that, then you are only recognizing how stupid your own argument was.
---
Both arguments presume only one side cares about the health of the game, which is a retarded position to take.
---
He's gonna go join Gevlon. Actually, I'd rather have Gevlon than StainGuy.
---
not a global launch apparently not even on all the iOS app stores yet.
---
Hitting the first dude and hitting the last dude does.
---
That was entirely the point being made.
---
That 90th dude doesn't give you a different hit than the first.
---
I bet it's safe no one can roll in and kill you instantly.
---
Psyop pls
---
What do you think alts are for?
---
That's not a macro lmao, it's so easy to habitually spam dscan.
---
I'm sure many are farming in their home where 30 dreads will come to back them up. Well there's one group that does that and it hasn't helped them.
---
It's more like 500 iirc.
---
Spoken like someone that doesn't know how to use dscan.
---
&gt;But we are not discussing what nullsec was MADE for, we were discussing what keeps people in nullsec
---
So we are talking about something you know nothing about?
---
It balances out the economy, introduces a risk balance to nullsec, opens hunting up to more than just the disdainfully incompetent, makes the game more engaging than simple local counts.
---
Your argument about bots is under the assumption that bots are the only reason the change was made, also bots are STILL at greater risk under blackout even with the work arounds.
---
He has a very good point, and it does not read as bitching. 
---
CCP DEVS dont play the same game we do. And when i say we i mean all the players.
---
Lowsec is a wasteland with a few oasis. You need to jump to the contested areas of FW to find fights.
---
I'm just a little concerned for that Gkey dude its gona get fatigue
---
CCP have had a piss-weak merch store for 16 years.  
---
Why change now?  
---
Who needs money when you can spend your days making snazzy looking but functionally crappy new UIs?
---
lol. you do make me laugh garreth xD.
---
whats this? youve just realized you have got the complete wrong end of the stick and now your switch it to an insult.
---
nah bro, dont work with me.  the wierd thing is im saying what keeps me in nullsec. and many others, your telling everyone theyre wrong xD
---
your not my bro, fam
---
Yeah, the thing usually is - you can train other skills that will be more valuable for you. Sure, if its a Ishar/gila/whatever only alt, than you will get all those skills to V eventually, but more often you are in a situation where you decide not to spend months to maximise to level Vs but instead you go for something else e.g. PI, other ships you might want to use, more alliance doctrines, different PVE activities, industry, scanning, covops etc. etc.
---
You want a permalink to a fleet, yea?
---
If people aren’t automatically joined to it at login, and they still have to look up a evemail or MOTD, then why not just look for broadcasted fleets with the fleet window.
---
And if the fleet boss/commander is not there, how do you determine who gets FC?
---
In my corp the first person that’s on makes a fleet and it gets broadcasted.
---
Everyone else in space that comes on joins, if a higher ranking person comes on, they are offered FC if they want to lead, or if the first FC doesn’t want to lead anymore,
---
And its also easy to setup via any macro enabled keyboard.. I did it myself when living in a wormhole.
---
Hey bud, mind extracting the APK and hosting it on google drive or something?
---
I'm having issues getting google play to let me download.
---
Fly there in a ceptor.  Trash it.  Fly back.  It's no longer in your assets.
---
&gt;whats this? youve just realized you have got the complete wrong end of the stick and now your switch it to an insult.
---
its a bot you fucking idiot...
---
*Separate* app?? Why not just update the old one?
---
&gt; Your device isn't compatible with this version.
---
Fantastic.
---
I honestly get that and frankly zero fucks would be given if you had it macro enabled. I mean its just a KB bind, a far cry from botting etc..
---
just follow the rest of us and usub till CCP decide to unfuck eve
---
no shit sherlock, have you seen its name?
---
my side cares about the health of THE game your side cares about the health of YOUR game
---
They have already announced intentions to hit wormholes.
---
But you're also ignoring that WH are more chaotic by their nature.
---
Play this in the background and you have the true classic feeling. https://srv-file7.gofile.io/download/4WFAXa/wow_waiting.swf
---
The Gate is red
---
You're the one who responded...
---
yes, it's perfectly safe. we make at least 10b/h, while being afk and safe.  
---
it's really easy, just find you hole and do the same !  
---
do it
---
I think it's the opposite.
---
It's a terrible point and is absolutely just bitching to bitch.
---
It's not hard to move T1 industrials.
---
The nullblocs pretty much perpetuate the feeling of being a cog in the machine, or a drop in the ocean though for some players. Some players will like the feeling of being part of a big powerful group, but some will feel essentially isolated since they're not forced to form relationships with others, the way you kind of have to in small groups.
---
The problem as I see it is that the "Join Brave, KF or PH" solution is nearly the only one proposed to newbros because smaller groups don't have the marketing power that the blocs have and they don't work for everybody. And it's not how a lot of veteran players started either.
---
Mine too, dont get why though?
---
You can trash directly from assets.
---
You get that this goes against the "make eve more dangerous approach" right? Thats why that approach is rather stupid because what you are stating here is what they should have done a long time ago. With some changes ofc.
---
If you had stashed SP to train cynos, you literally had zero reason to waste them until changes are live. Just saying, you have nobody to blame but yourself for that.
---
its quite a bit over 500 like 580 or something but unless you are shooting EM you gotta fight resistance too so 800 dps tank isnt unrealistic
---
It is, for certain categories. Logistics savings, all materials in place. Turnaround time is a key value for Jita. And it leaves me some time for my Tornado at undock and local chat. :D
---
CCP: "You guys have phones released in the past month, right?"
---
They already do on the forums. Mighty fun to read 🍿
---
Did you read what I wrote earlier? And I came back to play Eve after latest changes. And a lot of my old buddies are coming back after summer if they keep doing these changes. None I know have quit the game because of these changes. A lot of people I know have said they are having most fun with Eve in years.
---
Goons hate that.
---
Because a jump freighter is about 9bn and carries 3x as much (making it suitable for huge scale mineral moving and the likes).
---
It’s very good so far. I added several skills to the queue, bought a couple of cheap skills, and injected a few bonus SP just to check it out.
---
It needs much much more hand holding. Imo you should be guided atleast into your first player owned corp before the game lets you go. Until then it should constantly give you suggestions and reward you for trying stuff out.
---
But honestly, theres too much complexity in the game and alot of that has gotta go. Just look at the amount of mods we have that all pretty much do the same but are named a bit differently. Imagine being a new player trying to fit your first real ship. This is what makes new players quit.
---
Pve shouldn't be risk free. But right now we have risk free hunting.
---
They all count Bro and yes that first one really is a sweet thing.
---
I don't think flipping switches is necessarily what they are doing. One big problem with Eve is that the game has been figured out. People are so damn good at going through the complexity of the game that abyssals were figured out in a few days. Although very tedious, drifters were figured out in a few days as well.
---
Back in the day, a lot of the fun was innovating with new fits and fleet comps. Discovering some of the tenets of the current fitting meta (ie: don't fit armor and shield tanks) was a great feeling back when the game was new, up to maybe 2013. Innovations eventually became standardized and metas are pretty much set in stone.
---
I think CCP is trying to break the meta and change things up. League of legends would have died years ago if the champions weren't reworked every season, with a constantly rebalanced and evolving meta. I think (and honestly, hope) that CCP is trying to do the Eve version of that rebalancing.
---
 You're up there with olmeca on disingenuity   
---
oh look i get to say this again
---
Sure they do. This is a change to make EVE less like farmville and more like what made EVE successful.
---
Lots of people like Farmville.  And lots of people get mad when you move their cheese or make changes of any kind.
---
Put the money into coding.
---
It used to be that way lol there's a reason it got removed
---
EVE does not need player groups.
---
Solo battles are more exhilarating than fleet battles for non leaders.
---
Leading a group feels good.
---
Helping a player group operate feels good.
---
If the players in the group express gratitude.
---
 Officer appreciation day. 
---
  Tell your officers, thank you for helping run our organization.
---
I joined Pandemic Horde because I like solo and fleet combat.
---
App won't authorise my character\account at login. Done the 2FA piece but nothing happens when I press authorise
---
It was nice to see the goon flair and blackout and know what the rest of the post would say.  Saved a lot of reading.
---
Join a C2-NS/Cx wormhole corporation. Roll your static to get around different parts of nullsec. Fly nano ships that can go fast and apply far.
---
Make FW pvp again
---
So, you wouldn't wait... you'd go and do something more fun.
---
Needs another year to cook, but I'll certainly try it.
---
Resource scarcity would hurt smaller groups at first but eventually it would cause internal conflict for the major blocs. They would fragment as their elites claim resource rights while their line members starve. The line members would then join smaller groups until they become larger groups swarming against the elites until they fall. At which point... we have a dynamic system of rising and falling empires where only those who adapt survive.
---
You can get push notification when you extract SP.
---
I'm sorry you can't AFK rat or mine anymore. Change is hard on all of us but the more adaptable will survive.
---
You are absolutely right. I know of a lot of newer players that didnt fit in and they left. But I also know of tons more that stayed because it was a welcoming place and they got the chance to build a home and catch up in terms of SP and isk. 
---
But, there are no better options. Taking care of new players require tons of manhours and isk, 2 things the blocs have plenty of. This cant be said about smaller groups. Is it good for the game? Fk no, but its better than new players leaving right away because they didnt have anywhere to go.
---
I've done this. What really sucks is I used to be able to trash stuff remotely. Now that seems not to be the case, so cleaning up clutter is a PITA.
---
It's really better to just use an exploration ship and die rarely, as long as you're good about dropped off loot regularly.
---
Use a heron or whatever and pick stuff up in a travel fit interceptor.
---
I played for 13 years. I quit because as I got older I couldn’t justify sitting on a titan for hours or sinking time into the game where not a lot was happening. 
---
That along with fatigue and then the sov system changes just spoilt the aspects of the game that I enjoyed. 
---
The final nail in the coffin for me was skill injectors. One thing I did love about eve was that you couldn’t just buy your way into a big ship and have the skills to fly it. It took time. Now players can buy several rorqual accounts and farm semi afk. It became pay to win. 
---
I tried everything from invention, incursions, mining, low Sec rancer Gate vamps and several years in 0.0 alliance warfare. Had titans supers etc etc. 
---
I no longer wanted to sub three / four accounts and orbit an anchor at 5km spam f1 and broadcast for reps. 
---
The changes to local chat look good but I feel that came too late. 
---
Whilst I hope eve continues for decades as it will always be my all time favourite game I now prefer games like world of warships where you can log in shoot stuff take out your brain after a long day. 
---
Star citizen is starting to looking really good maybe in a few years I’ll try that.
---
how? log off in-system. no intel bots around that.
---
Die Middie punk!
---
Yours truly, Hib bard.
---
Not remotely these days. Something something POS code...
---
Aren't you limited in nullsec to similar fashion? I mean jump ranges yeah...
---
I don't know too many farmholes with 30 caps on standbye. In fact I don't know many homes with 30 caps on standbye. The best examples I've seen in a home hole is 7 caps max, 2 of which died. 
---
I don't think some of you understand the dynamics of how wormhole space works. You can't really have a major blob alliance in a hole and make it work like nullsec. Yeah you can cap blob, but are limited by members generally.
---
Heres the thing, you are assuming what made Eve succesful. And that you can replicate it somehow. But totally disregarding all other factors. If you had launched Eve today it would have died instantly, its simply another world today than 16 years ago.
---
More like you won't listen to anyone after asking a question.
---
It's your JF. Do what you want.  Good luck.
---
This statement alone says way too much about you. You have no real response to what Im saying so youre just calling me a krab. Without even knowing if its true or not. Its amazing actually.
---
He's saying he doesn't want to deal with more people's bullshit when he's playing a game. Retail is notoriously bad for the bullshit/hr you get to deal with.
---
Hunting has always be almost risk free, I don't care If I loose a 200m stratios time to time... Actually I don't even mind the risk, it won't stop me from hunting. 
---
And if its risk free it's because you decided it! Never understood people who solo rat in Vni and complain about dying. And there is other way to defend yourself than the titan umbrella... 
---
At least hunters creates event. What's the point of making isk for decade? Maybe it's just my opinion but krab online is incredibly boring.
---
Dude, no. If you wanna see if x affects y you dont introduce z. And you are assuming the bots are gone, they never were. They started changing behaviour around the drifter invasion which was before the blackout even.
---
Anecdotal evidence is always the best kind of evidence. Right? All the fking numbers saying more have left than returned means nothing, it cant be true cause you dont know any of them.
---
Hey, I know you won't listen to anyone trying to give you good advice, but there's a bright side.
---
You're right maybe 60-95% of the time.   That's more than half! You can *probably* get away with your methods at least some of the time. 
---
Good luck.
---
sign
---
The 3-5 groups don't bother me much hell they poped a porpoise i bought an hour earlier and i didn't rage instead we talked for a bit and i said happy hunting. It's the 100 man loki or bomber fleets that pop up blap a carrier/rorq and moon walk out that annoy me.
---
Wouldn’t have a clue how to do that man, and I’m on iOS anyway. I found that it doesn’t download on phones, I tried mine and my partners phone and it didn’t work, I tried both iPads and it worked, if you got a tablet give it a whirl.
---
It needs some dread wrecks. Hopefully sometime soon.
---
Strongly disagree unless you're counting monthly subscription.
---
Most P2W games stop your ability to progress or compete without paying.  After the monthly sub, EVE relies more on player knowledge than anything else.
---
Wreathe with hyper rigs and inertstabs is actually faster than any other cyno-capable ship post-change.
---

---
&gt; Most P2W games stop your ability to progress or compete without paying.
---
Literally no MMORPG does that.
---
&gt;After the monthly sub, EVE relies more on player knowledge than anything else.
---
And?
---
The old app and the new one are completely different under the hood and as such it's not something we can just push out an update to. For the time being they'll have to co-exist on the store but eventually we'll sunset the old Portal app and then drop the "2019" from the name of the new one.
---
What's WoW housing?
---
Agreed with most of that. Part I would disagree with would be the balance in the economy from the player/bot perspective.
---
People might be less predictable than bots, they are however capable of making many more different mistakes a bot never will. So since the numbers don't tell us anything about the ratio of ratters vs bots killed I would be hesitant to say it's made the botting problem better.
---
Yes, bots are more at risk now then they were before but so are players. So it might still be the case that bots are less affected by Blackout, in which case I would say that is a bad development. Since that would throw the economy off balance again, in favour of the botters even more.
---
A lot of people are talking a lot of shit. Subcaps are still by far the most used ships in the game and most def in NS fleet engagements. Caps dont get deployed all that often (cause they are honestly not that good) but people that dont live in null think thats all we do just because we drop caps for defense purposes.
---
But a jump freighter carries less than a half of a normal freighter.
---
So basically you have no position other than extremist rhetoric that ignores any point the other side makes?
---
No, I would wait.
---
My character would sit there.
---
&gt;Pay to win REQUIRES paying to win.
---
It doesn't.  Your game can be pay to win even if there's a "grind 2000 hours to get it all for free" option.
---
I would not call eve pay to win because player skill trumps any amount of money you can spend and it's not close. And if you're putting a bunch of cash into your ship, you're just creating a loot pinata.
---
One of the measures of success in EVE is how far you can stretch resources to achieve larger goals.  A person who makes systems to acquire resources in game will always be more sustainable than a person burning a credit card.  In fact the credit card warrior burns out so fast in comparison that it's laughable.
---
And most people wouldn't, they'd go and do something fun.
---
Can't you online modules on a friendly carrier\\orca\\nestor? Offline mods, drain ALL the cap, and strip 30\~70% of the shield (depending on the Cyno skill level) + docking and tether denial for a minute sounds much better.
---
And you choose to express your care for the health of THE game by discouraging new players?  Seems pretty disingenuous...
---
I've avoided ships besides t1 frigs to this point because, while isk isn't an issue for me, I still would prefer to be proficient with FW/plex PVP in general before I'm fighting in bigger plexes and ocassionally getting baited in pirate frigs instead of t1 frigs, etc.
---
It's already in Google's play store
---
Im not saying dont rework everything connected to capitals.
---
lower fighter bomber damage,
---
lower anticapgun damage
---
lower the single target DD damage
---
lower the %buff on the armour plates you put on supers. (along with lower thier tank.
---
it still would take the same amount of cap dreads to kill a super, but it would take alot less sub caps.
---
bringing the two closer together. is what i am suggesting as an idea
---
LOL, if you are NOT the one controlling the ACL of the Citadel (aka your private) a station will always be safer than a citadel. It takes huge amounts of retardedness to die with a JF or a Capital on a Station (choosing wrong station falls under point 1, massive retardedness)
---
&gt; e.g. PI, other ships you might want to use, more alliance doctrines, different PVE activities, industry, scanning, covops etc. 
---
Im not saying DONT train the other skills at all. you can get level 3 in all of the skill here quickly and with no hassel.
---
im saying it is Worth then getting level 5 in the things you do or use the most.
---
I honestly dont get why this new cyno cant be fitted to everything. Its a cyno that locks out all other capitals except for one specific thing that wasnt gonna get hit with the nerf bat. Whats the point in making JF movement more tedious.
---
i mean, by yourself you can t but if you gather enough willing people you could make a dent. 
---
for goons you re talking about the same level of effort as you would need to drive  said truck in the heart of the civilized world - would take time, coordination and would be prone to fail. 
---
Also the only true force multiplier you can get is trust, unlike explosives rl.
---
why would take an Itty 5 and  ... WHY?
---
Nereus is the way to go
---
The new app is built in unreal 4.
---
Depending on how old your phone is, it might not work with it.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pww4x0/introducing-eve-portal-2019-edition
---
He is saying it wasnt designed to impact logistics. And he is right. The complaint was superumbrella and capital drops on small gangs, not logistics. Its a big difference.
---
It ties into the fact that CCP doesnt really seem to know what theyre doing since they dont actually play the game.
---
Hey roqs have to seige for 5 mins and they only make 150m an hour.
---
I think the price is fine. The mechanics of the game almost requires alts. There should be some changes to alleviate those restrictions (like allowing more than one corp).
---
&gt;You’re too restricting yourself to little T1 frig in this very stacked game, when lots of people can afford faction frigs. 
---
I've only been limiting myself like this cause I am so new to the fast-pace of FW fights that I wanted to at least lose like 50-100 t1 hulls before I "grew up" into faction/frigate hulls (and destroyers). Maybe I'll have to graduate early, heh.
---
It's really sad how few people know the power and glory of the radial menu.
---
ikr
---
Thats literally passive play. Now swipe that card a few more times and build a Capital and just do what you like to do. Let's see how long you can stand.
---
I don't think you know the difference between P2W game and
---
P2P[rogress] game
---
Yeah... because that vehement that recently died was an example of perfectly safe capitals in WHs.........
---
Ssssh, just let stupid F1-monkeys reee at him and feel better, but still know shit about game mechanics, economy and so on ... everybody needs a relief sometimes
---
Ok, thanks, I'll check out the stream. This is generally the sort of thing I have been doing. I have a bunch of hulls and mods staged near amamake and tama, and I'll usually check amamake/tama to see if there is a quick "fair" (I know, I know) fight to be had before I run like a 15-ish jump loop and end up back there to try again.
---
On a good day I find 3-4 fights in an hour, but on off days when I roam 2-3 hours and don't find any "good" fights, I end up rageposting like this. I've usually flown brawlers and scram kiters, but maybe I need to work on more web kiters and legit kiters to try to get a fight even when it's something the closer-range t1 frig would just get overwhelmed by like most/all faction/pirate frigates.
---
It adds the flexibility of the fleet members joining before the fleetboss.
---
My point was - training lets say medium rail spec to V will probably be a worse option compared to lets say training Minmitar cruisers to V so you could also join muninn fleets with the main dps ship and not just eagle fleets.
---
Ofc, it depends on the skills. There also quite a few skills you can't live without V.
---
How, I can’t see the option of doing so
---
Make sure you tell everyone where you're going too... for reasons...
---
I mean, WoW had its "You think you know that, but trust me, you really don't" moments.
---
It'll be funny if we will learn that he was right about that in a few months.
---
&gt; left click and hold for a second and slide to show info
---
Imagine not having radial menu bound in 2019.
---
That is essentially requiring payment though, because the real player will virtually name acquire that.
---
That's a token amount of in game accessibility.
---
I feel like getting all these bigmouths into a single dread farm just to watch when their perfect safety they claim they have is not so perfect and they both get their dreads gobbled as well as their ass podded out of their own hole.
---
That's what alts are for!
---
Poor Indigo
---
&gt;Choose one. Especially when it's at the rate you cited. And you have to actually haul it out of the hole to get the ISK.
---
It's as safe with critting your holes as many people keep saying krabbing in null was so yes, if null krabbing deserved a nerf for making too much ISK in that amount of safety so should WHs.
---
that would depend on what you use more. do you use a t2gun rupture more or a munnin,
---
if your in say, panfam, they will use munnins alot, and ruptures at gatecamps only.
---
you just listed two different level5 skills, i thought you were the one saying not to train level 5 as it takes too long?
---
Your device isn't compatible with this version.
---
Older phone?
---
but eve should be safe for newbies!!!
---
I've got a 3 year old pixel XL that's starting to show it's age.
---
I can still run the app just fine, what are you using?
---
An LG G3.
---
Perhaps. I've got an LG G3.
---
lolno
---
Flair checks out.
---
Probably it, 2014 is pretty dated in terms of smartphones when you only get a couple years of support.
---
Ah, bit older than mine then.
---
Hopefully CCP can improve it, so it runs on a larger array of devices. It does seem like a significant improvement to the old app.
---
&gt; note: this means that Jump Freighters will not be able to jump to covert cynos as we originally planned. This is an alternative solution, not an additional one. 
---
How is this not the important part of this link xD holy shit i was looking forward to covert cyno JF's
---
Last time (in null) I engaged in what I thought was a nice and enjoyable fight (my HAC vs a battlecruiser), I got hotdropped by a fucking supercarrier. PL, of course.
---
Lesson learned I guess. Would like to see some more "solo/small gang PvP" opportunities in null.
---
Yeah it sucks and it sucks even more that an upgrade costs an arm and a leg these days...which is why I've been clinging onto my G3.
---
same
---
You're not going to get an honest answer here, asking the addicts.  They want more subscribers into the game to boost the declining login numbers and to provide them with new, easy, targets.  CCP is proving they have no idea how to fix it themselves, as chaos is the opposite of design.
---
NONE of the people telling you it'll be great actually play EVE casually.
---
Lol what? So you have a much faster drop than usual after implementing something extremely divisive and the only reasonable conclusion is that something else is causing it? 
---
Have you even read the MER? Which is CCP data that literally says there is less activity going on in the game after this change. Less activity corresponds with lesser players (or atleast accounts) online. Its not rocket science dude.
---
I'm pretty sure I could play EVE mobile on my phone and yet can't even install a simple ESI interface app. lol
---
I feel yah, I'm still on a Galaxy S7. 2016 phone.
---
To be honest i've not seen a reason to upgrade, you can pick up an S7 for like $200 new these days and it's still getting security updates.
---
Would recommend.
---
How many people are "enough"? Are we talking like a significant percentage of one of the large blocs or could a smaller group of say 10 - 15 people actually do something?
---
That's the thing, like most groups in other MMOs tend to be 10 - 20 man groups, this would be similar in Eve if those smaller groups had a honest chance to do anything, but against large blocs with hundreds of real people in them (each with 5+ accounts) ; what chance does a group of 10 people have?
---
Let me be clear here, I am not saying I think the game should be balanced in such a way that 10 people can have a stand-up fight against a group of 100 people. The only thing I am saying is that with the game being like it currently is, there simply isn't a way for any group who isn't the size of a major bloc to effectively fight said major bloc; and this is certainly not helping the stagnation. 
---
Re trust: I totally agree. That is one way a small group could fight a large one, the fall of BOB was fucking epic.
---
All of this said, I think that the lack of asymmetric warfare is only a small part of the percieved stagnation of Eve.  I still think a large part of why the game feels stagnant is because the large blocs (who could be creating content) simply are not creating content.
---
It is easy to blame CCP, but we the players cannot act like we have no responsibility. We are the ones playing the game, we have tons of freedom (way more than any other MMO) and we chose to use this freedom to do nothing.
---
Well, you can't reorder the character list, and it's a basic feature.
---
That's a fact, not an opinion.
---
This is a very good answer. P2W has no clear definition per se. It depends on the game and circumstances.
---
Nice shot Girasmelli!
---
Pvp honor grind each season was dumb. Arena in bc and wrath was the funnest pvp I've had in any game. Very challenging and competitive.
---
I was doing the same thing!
---
I'm on the s7 edge. No issues running the app.
---
You're not missing much. A lot of basic functionality isn't there yet.
---
Please no Doom.
---
Same issue on my end pal, feels bad! T.T

---
You've clearly never krabbed in a c5 and it truly shows.
---
Please experience it yourself before parroting other peoples opinions on reddit.
---
Then perhaps a solution would be to allow the 3 characters on 1 Omega account to log in simultaneously?
---
Its nice to see all the "my playstile is the only valid one, get rekt krabber idiot" folks go in " let me explain" mode when you point out their bullshit. If only we had counters for narrative spinning on this site.
---
I dont get why people keep using asset safety as a silver bullet. We already have structures that drop loot, industrial complexes. Nobody is rushing to kill them. By your own logic people should be running all over the place popping them but its not happening.
---
And nothing used to drop before when there were more wars.
---
Maybe, and here Im just speculating wildly, there are other factors at play?
---
That was after Curse, when Deklein was given to Goons, TEST recieved the testagram pocket there.
---
It's all Veldspar, he's gonna need a freighter - a couple of those are more than 4m units
---
It's a free market. Start building and selling TI industrials around common JS stops.
---
First time in a while i see a goon talking sense, but really eve is old... and children don't like a game where patiencen is a thing, they have overdosed on high colorful plastified battle royales (which existed wayyyy before fortnite)
---
Ah, got you. Thanks.
---
&gt;Players are terrible at game design.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Sometimes we can catch problems.  Sometimes individuals can have good ideas.  But groups tend to be absolutely awful at it.
---
You'll have to elaborate on that a bit. I don't see how that's relevant to my comment.
---
Ohyeah no mines working fine. All good on the S7. Just talkin about feeling the not wanting to pay for an upgrade part :P
---
Except he's not. The only reason blizz is actually doing this is because they finally realized people DO want it and they can actually get money from it. There's more than enough that wanted this to keep it afloat,  despite what all these "it's JuSt NoStAlGiA,YoUlL AlL qUiT aFtEr a WeEk" people
---
I managed to jump on for 15 minutes this morning (working from home) and it was glorious. The pain of seeing new spells, but not being able to afford to train them. Trainers actually being relevant again!
---
My quiver and arrows were back (Yes I'm a hunter - deal with it! ;))
---
Getting Mark of the wild buff from a a player running past.
---
Not knowing where the quests were.
---
Red mobs in the starting area again!
---
People talking in general.
---
Why didn't I take a few days holiday? I have played retail for a couple of years now, but got a month to check out Classic and was taken right back!!!
---
For sure the s7 is a solid phone. Had it for 3 or so years, can't see me upgrading any time soon.
---
No, no, no. There are ofc legitimate skills you need to train to Level V (for T2 guns, T2 hulls etc etc. or just all around necessary skills like CPU, powergrid management, JDC etc), I was just implying that its a matter of choosing which alternative is best for you - training lets say a weapon specialisation to V (which most likely won't change your gameplay or experience much) or going for something else that will enhance your gameplay.
---
For example why should I train medium rail spec to V if it only gives a small and in the grand scheme of things insignificant bonus and also only a portion of my alliance stratops are with eagles? I want to fully contribute so thus I choose to train for muninns which is the other main doctrine. Choosing not to train for that specialisation skill gives me more for the same training time.
---
Sure if you have like 40+m SP, or you aren't playing that active, you will train more and more skills to V.
---
Also, I wonder how long it will take before CCP abandons this project?
---
Too bad its 1 on 1
---
You are also assuming they are not gone. You dont have the stats and i dont have stats either. Since ccp is not releasing their reasoning, thats all we are doing here :D
---
Generally i would agree with you but you dont even know what is x and what is y. you are just assuming what it is
---
Cheers for the app falcon it's been too long without an update o7
---
Both should be options. Manual flight of big ships is generally stupid but frigs and stuff could totally benefit from more responsive manual flight.
---
Fleet warp is a thing
---
Alright, thanks for the advice. I definitely can't keep straight what systems/groups are most likely to give a good fight yet. I can't even remember names of people I've fought, lol. It's enough for me to try to remember my wins and losses to improve a bit for my next fight still at this point.
---
I know TZ can be a big deal. My usual hours are mid-USTZ (like 0100-0300) so it's not the busiest times but not bad. I really wish I could fly during EUTZ for the higher population, but it's really just not a tz I can get online for hardly ever.
---
Here's the blog post.
---
Built in UE4. That's interesting and cool!
---
Liking it so far.
---
Dont fking touch asset safety. It will not become an incentive for more "real" wars. Its one of the dumbest assumptions I have heard. Why the fuck would blocs go to war over some potential loot when they make shittons more just by sitting at home and defending their Rorqs and supers?
---
Troll post
---
What? Mine auto filled the passwords.
---
Well really depends, that sounds like a bit of a shit garmur pilot depending on what your fit was. He should be able to pace your drones and defang you whilst keeping you pointed in all honesty.
---
But it's not how the game works. There is no option for manual aiming/firing and stuff. The engine is not made for it. If you want to fly fighters and shit, go play Valkyrie, E:D, or literally any of the million other space fighter games.
---
Android? I'm using ios
---
Ah... i see
---
fleetwarp with disabled brain, warping instantly on decloak of hostile into a bubble that is on dscan that was setup during his last rewarp timer ... mkay ... looks totaly manual to me
---
Same in my motorola Moto g4.... CCPlease?
---
You bastard... xDDD
---
x is the blackout. y are its effects. You cant measure what the blackout caused in terms of activity if you have incentives to log on. Its just basic science man and you know it. 
---
Its an assumption based on what Ive seen and heard. Bots are not gone, I have seen the change myself.
---
Well written post and good points. Some additions-
---
&gt; Economy: The Utopia that was Never Meant to Be
---
* Not having Resource Scarcity and having an overabundance of nullsec systems that, for a simple upgrade fee, you increase the resources by ratting and mining MORE.
---
* The only answer to everyone having something is to make new somethings... but as you mention with an aging playerbase with less time, this becomes even more monotonous of a chore.
---
* Hardcore games like Rust address this through wipes which aren't feasible in Eve.
---
&gt; Culture: The Ageing Player Base
---
* There are many games (Escape from Tarkov, Rust to some degree) where you can get your hardcore, risk items/loot for it all, in a much quicker time. EfT in particular gives me all the shakes that Eve gave without the boring grind to look for or set up a fight.
---
* It's worth mentioning that offensive fights take so much longer to setup and execute. Critical structures have multiple RFs and minimum time to complete the RF. TiDi makes it all the more awful. No one has time for this shit anymore. It is ironic that Goons have easily the strength to stomp out the rest of nullsec but unintuitive and excessively grindy offensive mechanics are what stops them (that and 0 reward for executing them).
---
&gt; Looking Outwards: The Rising Competition and the Complacency of EVE
---
* As mentioned above, plenty more hardcore games are out there to get the fix that Eve once gave. Eve can create compelling large scale fights which no other game can currently... but at a certain point it becomes total TiDi cancer. The 01Y fight with Snuff/GOTG was probably the greatest example of what this game CAN be but won't due to TiDi putting a hard limit on large supercapital brawls.
---
&gt; When pressed about how EVE is going to recover, they say "a massive influx of new players" will rectify it.
---
* I don't think any of us that are anti-carebear think this is going to happen. To be honest the best possible outcome right now, for us 'elite pvpers', is the chaos mechanics usher in a higher degree of conflict and carebear salt (cause tbh we've had 2 years of the HTFU and 'do what we do' rhetoric). We all agree that the game is dying but better to go out with a bang than Rorquals mining into that good night.
---
Neither of us *know* which would kill Eve faster, or even if either would actually kill it. It's stupid to ask for an answer to that question. 
---
I pointed out a weakness in the proposed system. Don't misinterpret my words as "Here's a fault, therefore the whole thing is bad and dumb." I'm trying to make it better.
---
Well the thing is. If you implement "dynamic environments, accessible UI and economy, and less time-consuming content", will it still be EVE? Do you want a casual version of EVE? 
---
The "meaningless grinding" is actually something that gives you a sense of acomplishement long term and is one of core values of EVE. BUT you need to feel that you CAN actually compete and achieve something special. In the age of thousands of Titans and all SOV taken by unevictable groups blue to each other, there is virtually nothing you can achieve to be special. More so as a new player. And this hoplessnes is what drives new players away as well.
---
I dont think that making EVE more like todays shitty popular casual games is a good way to go. I think the game should stay as it is for people who are interested in this type of game. BUT and here is the important part:
---
The game NEEDS TO RESET. Just wipe the server and start anew. Because the overabundance of everything and lack of new players who feel they cant compete is killing the game. Let EVE stay the hardcore grindy and time-intensive game for those who will appreciate it. But it need a new blood and new age. Bittervets who already achieved everything are not contributing to the game meaningfully anyway. And I am speaking for myself too.  
---
Let the game return to simpler and happier times, where you can actually achieve something great again.  
---
Just look at WoW Classic and its success. Its a different game, but starting anew in a simpler setting is something that people appreciate.
---
Yep, Android. 
---
Might be a Google thing maybe. A lot of my passwords autofill
---
Not sure what you mean.  I've been playing for years mostly only paying for my subscriptions and I have a respectable amount of wealth.
---
I have no problem competing with anyone regardless of how many thousands of dollars they may have spent.
---
Which app are you talking about? There are many different ones out there
---
Grats! I think I saw you in local yesterday! Let's fight!
---
The one ccp released today.  
---
Allows updating skills without logging in when your omega for example. and is alot more reactive than the old eve online app (official ones in both case made by ccp games)
---
Cyno changes inc, for better or worse!
---
Despite the memes, a decent percentage of Eve players will have gone to WoW for a few days. That's not something the state of the game would have changed much.
---
It was hot so BBQ time not eve
---
Great, my phone isn't compatible with the app --"
---
I'm 99% the dude is a not, but in the off chance he's a legit spodbrain, get a screenshot of him turning on his lasers. All at once in a couple seconds? Bot or input broadcaster. 2 minutes of lasers going online? Terminal spodbrain.

FUCKING FUCK FUCK SHIT FUCK my phone is too old to install it.

For sure, I was baking.

Somehow my first batch of cookies came out more like brownies. A happy accident.
---
The news are recent for me. 2018 is a recent event.
---
Just because there was no "formal war declaration" doesn't mean "the war vs 1 man armies" isn't live.
---
Are you a "one man army" able to move goods 4+ regions with zero interaction with another human being? 
---
Congratulations! You sound like you're "now in the cross hairs to expunge a cancer of the game". 
---
Make "Massively Multiplayer Online" great by enforcement making "Masses of Multiple people working together" again the reason for others to log in.
---
Are you saying eve is dying!? 
---
Whilst you mention aging player base as your reasoning and I agree that new players need to get involved I suspect eve will begin to attract new players once the UI is improved (which they are working on finally). Content whether it be pve or PvP can be found immediately if you know where to look. If a little bit of danger means your content is ruined then this game was never for you but I suspect the players who have played for a decade are very much able to cope. It’s the newer skill injected carrier ratters who have never had to learn the core game mechanics who are struggling. I see it like running cheats on a game - you get to much to quick and there is nothing to train towards/no long term goal to get excited about. Wow a Titan is the best ship in the game ? Nice I’ll fly it tomorrow. Then what. Players used to have to plan for 12 months to fly a carrier. Often an alt being side trained to help support it. It meant time invested - a sense of accomplishment. I see so many threats to leave to go play classic wow and I die a little inside that these players picked up eve in the first place. They are the rorqual pilots, the safety in numbers people, the risk averse. The game has been in decline but finally after so long it is being revived.
---
Nullsec blocs will start to fight once ccp introduces scarcity. It’s coming. It’s human nature. Eve has been dying since 2003 and other then the fact everyone who has quit keeps posting on this sub I’m seeing more action and new life in game now then ever before.
---
Well, I realize they had a lot of time to think it through and through. It's been years. But some part of me still says that you can profit off nostalgia just as well.
---
That, and it's just beyond me why on earth someone would prefer vanilla to BC or maybe WotLK, so there's that.
---
il fight you
---
Where abouts did you see me in local? Also who is you? :p
---
I resubbed briefly a bit ago only to find some parts of lowsec also succumbing to blob warfare. Too many capital's and supers across Eve, just a batphone away.
---
So true.
---
Can you give at least a hint at the requirements? I have a dual-boot tablet that can actually play actual EVE when in Windows, but not a fancy skill switcher? Srsly?
---
Sounds like a great thing to me. Now the Jump-freighter pilots won’t have to train Cynosural Field Generation V!
---
So, when can we expect the skill queue write API to be available to players? :sun:
---
I think it's inevitable that instanced PvE and PvP are going to the future to CCP/PA strategy. While it may mitigate the problems listed in the OP, it is potentially at the peril of the dynamic of 0.0.
---
TBH if that post from a few months ago is accurate and injectors made 32m the year they were introduced vs the 9m from subs, the sub could be reduced to 10€ from today's 15 without much issue. But hey, CCP gets to decide if it's viable, or if they even want it.
---
grinding is just like doing chores irl. it´s not even considered effort.
---
Still miss DAoC hardcore.... just can't get myself to play on the broken homebrew servers
---
Yes... but it can jump.
---
Cell phone tech super duper annoys me. My droid turbo is still running great and has better specs than most of the budget phones I see for sale these days... but because it's old, newer apps won't work on it. QQ.
---
There is still room for everything in EVE, just depends on what you expect of yourself, how "relevant" you want to be and so on. There are jobs that are "literally" fulltime in EVE, and there are thousands of casual players just utilizing the structures such "content-makers" create or just stay in safer areas of space doing some Mining while having a beer and chatting with friends.
---
TLDR : You can now add/remove/reorder skillQ on your phone with this app
---
It’s the ciiiiircle of liife
---
You have to be real stupid to send a server command from all of your accounts at the same time while botting. Even basic bots I expect would have some kind of delay. 
---
In general stop trying to conjecture bots just use the report bot button it's not hard to realize in a game that runs in 1 second increments it's hard to tell a human from a bot and just shut up about it.
---
The cyno changes are causing you to quit the game ? That is a shame.
---
Frigate PVP.
---
Not sure where I saw you. It's a miracle your name triggered something in my brain at all. I'm usually too overloaded with fighting and trying to figure out what happened why to remember names at all :)
---
Explanation: Sitting in the station spinning in my crow and I think I see the missiles clipping the launcher in front of them... You get away with it this time CCP!
---
Fight me in Lamaa
---
So... CCP is spending development time re-doing what the community already completed?
---
I took a vni into brace space yesterday and was poking 6 rorquals for some kind of response. A harpy and tengu came in but wouldn’t leave the cluster of rorqual reps / links. Then a Titan came in. 
---
Test have been welcoming roaming gangs recently and everyone is having more fun. If the other blocs weren’t so quick to undock overwhelming force they might actually get the content they are looking for
---
Sounds like goldrush in AoE2.
---
Thank you the explanation about the corporation WAMPS. WAMPS is a corp for small group pvp.
---
The reason I call it 'flipping switches', is because what they're doing doesn't seem to really be getting at the actual heart of the problems that affect EVE currently. These are, essentially, very simple 'solutions' for issues that require a certain level of complex response. 
---
Take Incursions, for example. These things have been figured out ages ago by those who play them, and are largely 'safe' PvE. This is because CCP's only approach to PVE is essentially "overwhelming damage with simple triggers". To put this another way, the way a lot of PVE is set up is actually pretty heavily skewed towards the 'risk' side of risk vs reward. If you screw up, there's a really good chance you'll lose your ship. As such, players study the systems and take them apart-- and because those systems are so simple to begin with, the result is PVE that's largely risk free. 
---
But... turning things like NPC bounties off, or messing with the rewards isn't the solution here. The solution ought to be to keep adding additional systems on top of what already exists so the outcome is much harder to predict. There shouldn't be *one* version of a nation commander outpost, but 20, each designed in such a way that fucking up is costly, but not a total wipeout (or else players won't play the content to begin with). And, for heavens sake, the triggers should never be the death of a single NPC or a single NPC taking damage or whatever. 
---
&gt;I think CCP is trying to break the meta and change things up. League of legends would have died years ago if the champions weren't reworked every season, with a constantly rebalanced and evolving meta. I think (and honestly, hope) that CCP is trying to do the Eve version of that rebalancing.

I don't doubt that CCP is trying to shake up the meta, but what concerns me is that I'm not sure they're willing to really dive in deep and get at the actual underlying problems that have gotten the game to this point. And I'm not certain restricting cynos to certain very expensive ships is ever a solution to any problem at all.
---
How would they make money off new phone sales if you didn't have a reason to upgrade?
---
Yes it is. I run a public fleet this friday, hit me up if you would like to see to shoot spaceships, dont worry about ships, we provide everything :)
---
Got a link to that community app that lets you change your skills from out of game?
---
Congratulations on your solo kill sir. I am happy for you. I am glad that you found action in low-sec.
---
And get push notification when you or someone extracts SP from your char :)
---
&gt; Reduce the size of the ad's... litteraly takes 40% of my phone screen :(
---
Archy, you do realise this is CCP right? If they're not ramming PLEX deals down your throat, they're plastering Falcon's mug all over the launcher.
---
If you want a good UI, you aren't going to get it from CCP.
---
Obviously.  Sometimes it doesn't work.  I've had items stuck in assets I'm unable to trash until I fly to the actual station to trash it.
---
That’s my point. It doesn’t matter what my drive is, and you don’t have to get it either. Everyone enjoys different things and wants different things out of this sandbox. No where did I even mention plexxing an account or struggling to make isk to do so. I make enough money IRL to comfortably plex 6 accounts so I could focus on whatever I wanted to do in the game. 
---
I have a personal problem with being willingly inept and incompetent. I’m not interested in being the subject matter of the next “this guy lost 3 freighters in a row on the undock” Reddit post purely because I was too lazy to take the steps that I KNOW I should take to ensure I’m not low hanging fruit for the next well prepared guy. That’s not how I like to live my life, if that’s how you like to play the game that’s cool.
---
Regardless of what you want to do, I would say there’s not many play styles that allow you to access “content” with less than an hour of preparation. The most quick and care free way I ever played this game was actually running L4 missions in high sec(we all know how bad that isk is plus you’re missing half the game that way) because I had fitted ships ready at stations with agents, you jump in, run a few missions and dock up safely. But in the grand scheme of things whether you are saving for PLEX, a titan, skill injectors, a Rorq, etc. the amount of time you have to dumb into those farming methods to reach that goal is pretty excessive.
---
It wasn’t one game mechanic or another, just the overall time the game absorbs. You clearly did miss is, I’m not “complaining” about it, I was agreeing with OP on the perspective he offered. And I’m not “doing” it, I stopped playing EVE earlier this year, I just browse this Reddit to see what the next crazy chaos era implementation.
---
Zzzzz
---
You said you were unsubbing so your collection of hulls can collect more dust. Make sure you move your stuff to npc stations before asset safety is removed

sadly; can always hope!

im not fond of fighting people in high grade snakes with my 6m sp

You sad sack.  Really?  Go and play a real game.

iOS... I can see your issue there.

I think the older one was outsourced, this one done in-house.

How do I link Google remote desktop app?

Rorquals ruined this game. Get over it grab a barge
---
Also a hunter! &lt;3
---
very well could be, guess a statement like "apps officially supported by ccp"
---
Im too poor for high grade and i can fly t1 to fight you, podding included. No implants :)
---
Only two out of the three torpedoes in a launcher actually fire they just alternate between the two. The third is for show. This is probably due to a limit of two animations per launcher/turret.
---
I would love bc. That's when I started. I'd settle for vanilla after what wow has become now. Completely different game for a different audience
---
There are also equally as many posts every day from people with only good things to say about these changes and black out etc.  Yeah we get it, null bears and botters who have benefited from risk free PVE in null for years aren't happy.  Most people who undock for solo or small gang pvp seem to be pretty happy about these changes.  The Goons/Null bear group think on the subject is fucking boring.
---
Add skill training to ESI, and I guarantee there will be one within a week.
---
As a player of charity, allow me to first apologize for criticizing so heavily when you don't really play.  
---
If you want, I can "invest" your isk for you while you're away ;) ;) ;) ;)
---
The built-in remote desktop on windows is muuuuch better, and I say that as someone who used CRD for years.
---
With current blackout it is quite easy to identify them, not by the way they target rocks/rats and activate mining lasers / weapons, but by the warpoff &amp; rewarp mechanics. These bots just use local chat and Overview to detect hostiles, but not dscan. Also they do not log who enters or leaves system. So you can sit there cloaked, and analyze them 1 or 2 cycles. Then send them docking by uncloaking, put bubble into Anom they were in and wait for rewarp timer.
---
In this thread we have a moron that doesn't know what fleet warp is. Or a guy that doesn't know just to hit report bot and move on.
---
Chaos 😂 XD random changes
---
sorry, but that is reatrded narrative sperg
---
Imagine paying for a game where you wait hours just to play it.
---
Man, I'm not even in my 30s yet and it's getting harder and harder to stay up until 12 to 1 AM for EVE.
---
There's already a feature that allows you to stay partnered up with your friends after downtime. It's called being in a Corp. 
---
Then when you form a fleet, you make it visible to Corp members and they can join at will. 
---
Fleets are like Parties in other games. And no other game leaves you partied up every day. You form a party when you're working together on missions or raids or whatever. You don't just form a party to hang out. That's what guilds and Corps are for.
---
I myself am a 16 year old who just got into Eve, and  thing about my generation is we don’t have the attention span/patience for such a game. Eve doesn’t have the shock value or “intensity” as other popular games. This is only a minuscule contribution or eves downfall, but a solution to this seems hard as eve’s whole allure of a slow growing game is its downfall. Most or almost al of my friends prefer fortnight or other 5 minute match games, but the reason I love eve is because I prefer
---
spending a day of my weekend instead of an hour a day not only playing the game but with life in general, I prefer long whole day experiences over habits/routines, another reason why is the sheer immersiveness not in gameplay but political science, human behaviour, economy, philosophy... and the unknown... I think why I like Eve is that the game design is a perfect match for a small window of people like me, and people with my type of personality are a dying breed. I think the current state of Eve is fit for a niche of players which is a small amount of people. I think the game can either change drastically inviting new players and killing old ones(Eve V2) or accept that the demand will never allow the game to grow.
---
Gave a little speech there, I’m just a dumb stubborn kid, but I still hope that it might bring a new perspective from someone like me. I haven’t pondered much about the topic and me response is based to my 3 week experience of eve and replies to the post. Please bare with me that I don’t understand most mechanics of the game since I’m new. Please criticize anything you disagree with/ think I’m wrong.
---
(:
---
So instead of fixing the old portal they just put out a new one? Wtf Ccp
---
There's a built in one? 
---
I was not aware of this.
---
they did not include T1 Industrials, they changed it. JFs will not be able to jump to the Covert Cyno.
---
It's more like 500 mil an hour safe for some of us. Not all of us dread it up. But yes we deserved to be nerfed and a lot of the things we use deserve to be nerfed
---
I used to get great solo vs. gang or small gang content in entry systems such as HED-GP or PF-346.
---
Yeah... There's more hardpoints than you can actually control...
---
I still want the anubis ear antenna things

No this is a sister of eve station I believe

Warp means nothing because fleet warp...
---
But if he put all his mining laser in same tic; sure report him!!!
---
Uhhhhhh idk what wormhole you are living in but I've never lost any of my rattles (tfw when you cant Nestor with a alt). I've made filthy amounts of money as well. Crit all the holes in your c5 static have a scout on the main structures if the Corp there seems half active if someone rolls in hit the refit to your cloak fit (remove drone link for cloak) and then hit the gtfo off mod on both screens warp them to two separate safes. Has always worked for me.
---
Now we need PI on it then we don't have to log in anymore !
---
Agreed. 99% of r/eve doesnt even play they just bitch. The rest of us actually love the game
---
**Well i can say the same about you, because you are really wrong .AND YES I KNOW YOU MAKE 1.5 Bil in a C6, no don't talk to me about the risks you have NONE in reality.**
---
So lets just agree we know very little about each other and maybe next time on reddit before you go *ahhahaha you got wrecked @nullse*c think a bit. Cause now you get the reverse of it.
---
They came after nullsec first now its wormohole time.
---
&gt; Given that we’re building the new version of EVE Portal in a completely different engine, it’s not possible for us to simply release the new app as a build update for the original, so for now we’re going to name the new version “EVE Portal 2019” until we phase out the old app and remove it’s SKU from the Android and iOS stores.
---
&gt; We’ll then rename the new app to “EVE Portal” once this transition is complete.
---
I don't remember how to set it since I don't need it anymore, but if you search remote desktop in the start menu it'll come up.
---
Anyone know if I can download and play on both my iPhone and my Android? Or is it one activation code one device?
---
The issue is that CCP DEVS dont play the same game we do. 
---
Train Reading to level 2 at least when you reddit.
---
so you're saying u die bc ur too bad to use umbrella lol
---
ok cool
---
i keep farm u noob
---
u can't farm me i drop u
---
They finally did it in the Warlords expansion but it was kinda halfassed.
---
Point is that Jump Freighter pilots never had to do it in first place.      
---
Character that light the cyno had to initially ;)
---
ib4 your character deleted or your phone factory reset ... *something.ini*
---
And dies
---
Except the blue blob has been growing for many many years, long before rorqual changes, supercap proliferation and all those other things people point at as "the real reason". I don't think it's correct to just label it as a symptom that will go away when you do -insert action to fix "the real reason"-.
---
You can "trash it" remotely.  There is a button for that.
---
You are right when you say warping simultaneously alone does not prove botting. I would add then that you can stopwatch the rewarp intervals always to increments of 5 minutes usually starting with 15.
---
Always with full minutes, if your log says locking failed at hh:14:12 his timer will reset to zero at hh:15:00.
---
Imagine harbouring a KNOWN AND BANNED ISBOXING RMTER :joy:
---
no need to get riled up dude, why would you mix personal stuff with your game habits is beyond me tbh. good for you that you quit, as it seems it was more than a game for your and was def causing you grief so that's that.   
---
If you play it my way, you get less stressed about and you still get to play it- that's all i'm saying. It appears your drive is more of an intellectual matter - like you're trying to, you know, "be the best" in eve, which I can see why it would lead to a burnout.   
---
Myself I'm playing to get away from a life where I have to be precise about everything and actually try and be the best I can be, and into a place where I can take (much more) riskier actions and get some sort of emotion out of that (be it a glorious loss or a resounding victory). I've hauled 40b in a cloaky hauler through null, I rat with the holes unrolled in a pair of combat fitted domis \*for the sake of it\* not because I need the isk but because I like the fantasy of it (and because it lures people into getting ganked). I put guns on my haulers and like to fly polarized navy drakes and surprise content people in the face, idk - having fun. in a game.   
---
now you want to take it on that other side and can only have fun if you rat in complete safety (even though you can afford to play without ratting) - that's on you buddy, but srsly, good thing you quit then.
---
Whether they're bots or not, your OP only describes fleet warping. 
---
Care to update it with more details? I don't understand the point of this thread otherwise.
---
I was unaware of that statistic. Thanks. I really think that a change to Omega pricing will bring in new players and help to keep them. It wouldn't be an issue if that is not something that everyone agrees Eve needs. I see thread after thread of reports of lower peak logins and people claiming that new player retention is low so I really hope that CCP considers my ideas. I have posted this on the official forums as well if you'd like to join the discussion.

Agreeing with another post. If I was able to adjust extractors on PI then it would be an app I would use. The way it is right now....

WORTHLESS, and a waste of time and resources better spent elsewhere. Usual CCP garage.

Silver Miner is just a very passionate miner who has never been banned for RMTing.

Warhammer online was ok while levelling but the endgame just wasn't there

Yup, I agree.

Sorry for the late comment, but what setting gets the ship type and distance in blue/green on your brackets?
---
That post is just a sarcastic reply to all the posters always saying that it is totally natural and all explainable with high APM, fleetwarp or the likes that one person manages 50 accounts with no visible delay.
---
And this one would cloak AND jump
---
The issue is that the players believe Reddit has significant influence of the developers, so there's now a bitching on Reddit metagame.
---
Hopefully CCP is getting all their feedback from the CSM and ignoring this shit.  They're aiming for a better game in the long term while knowingly pissing off a fraction of their current player base, as any significant change in a 15 year old game would do.  It's a bold, refreshing strategy that flies in the face of the modern business model of keeping the status quo and using barriers to entry and buyouts to prevent competition.
---
But hey, goons as an organization have decided they don't like it, and they're really good at toeing the party line.

Also remember too, it's still summer, people are away.  You'll have plenty to shoot at next month.

Ingame chats to out of game means was in ccp's mind when making the new chat system, before they do that i guess i'd be good if it worked in teh first place first....

So you cant light one in a venture?

EVE can be chess, solitaire, or fidget spinners based on your spectrum level.

Htfu

&gt; Neither of us know which would kill Eve faster, or even if either would actually kill it. It's stupid to ask for an answer to that question.
---
We have an example of a dead server in Serenity.
---
&gt;I pointed out a weakness in the proposed system. Don't misinterpret my words as "Here's a fault, therefore the whole thing is bad and dumb." I'm trying to make it better.
---
You are pretty clearly trying to maintain the status quo.
---
Think the problem there is it'd be far too easy to automate. Then we'd have some serious SP farm botting problems.
---
You choose a device type when you apply for the alpha test so I’d assume it’ll be one code per device dude.
---
I played alpha clone since it came out up until early this year. You'll be fine
---
For small gang type stuff not as much, because the people/fleets are usually more flexible. But the larger the fleet generally the longer it takes to get the ball rolling in my experience. I think more people are on that side of it.
---
If you're just looking to find something to kill, it can be managed a lot faster than doing something like an op, where even going out to make some timers takes quite a while.
---
Those structures only drop loot when you kill them with an in progress job. So all you have to do to deny the attacker any loot is cancel the job before the structure goes low power.
---
That is exactly why we have to wait till next spring. We don't know. Numbers might be just botters and isk farmers leaving.
---
Oh, thanks.
---
I dropped the game before Cata, so I'm not even sure if I can say I know what WoW is about these days.
---
You are such a self absorbed fuckwit my dude.
---
Because my scenario is a specific hypothetical and you all seem to want to prove a different hypothetical that make you correct. That's not how any of this works. LOL
---
But in the case of fleet warping (as described in your OP) there would be no visible delay.
---
I think you need a better example to get your sarcasm across more clearly.
---
You can buy and inject skills from the portal as well as swap which skills are training from this app. 
---
This shit is awesome just from that standpoint. It also means you can interact with your eve character from anywhere. I'm hoping this means pi will be next.
---
If only that were true.
---
It'll be funny if they will start releasing expansions for vanilla the same way they did originally, lol.
---
Jesus, grade A autists have careers these days?

Might have to give it a go. Chrome remote desktop is a bit data heavy, I chewed through half of my data plan with it last month, I was only using it for about an hour a day.

 Ninja Uitoh is still playing in a different alliance.  Ninja Uitoh  is still playing the game. He or she logs on daily. You are wrong SpaceGump.

I would be OK with that as long as they stopped at wrath. Arguably the peak of wow

No situation is perfect. Even for station cynos. But I'm pretty careful. You may catch someone else, but catching me would be highly unlikely.
---
Yes it does, the hit is differrent depending on your status as you comit the evil crime of pvp.

&gt; we forget that Eve is supposed to be a video game and we forget to have fun playing this game.
---
I didn't at all. Ccp, on the Other hand...

Or PUBG or Apex or SC2 gold minerals or even slitherio. Put the valuable conflict drivers in one place with a gradient radiating outward. Whoever is sitting on the hill reaps the rewards but also has enemies on all sides. If you can't quite get on the hill you can be right next to it and still get more rewards while you build up strength and plot with the other runner-ups to take down the king.

---
Send your space friends to me, we need more dudes in our T1 shit
---
But you can manage your skill queue
---
Well, it's against human nature to kill one of our own species if we can avoid it yet in eve, player behaviour is entirely the opposite. Human nature, when talking about such large-scale behaviour in a fictive setting, is entirely malleable. All it takes is conscious action and a reason to take it.
---
Null players need to both be willing to break off and stop being member #47941 whose actions don't matter and go off into smaller groups across null, and they need a reason to do that. Even just the "willing" part is very difficult at the moment, let alone bringing in sufficient reason to. See these changes tossed out to upset the years of stagnation and people are decrying it because their giant blobs are no longer the safest way to play the game and get high in-game income.
---
Can’t tell if I’m being dumb or if adjusting skill queue isn’t working like it’s supposed to. How do I manage/update my skill queue? I’m tapping all the things to no avail. :/

DAoC was still the best fantasy MMO I ever played.  The RvR with keeps and skill combos that were directional and needed to be done in order.

Used to run with 8 to 12 man groups and we could AoE 50+ man zergs with the priest stun and enchanted ball of death.

EeeeeEEEEeeeeEe.

Especially now with blackout its better and easier in one way (in regions where the inhabitants still use their space and fight and not sit docked crying on reddit) because you will not get reported by Intelbots when you are still 10 jumps out. In another way it is also harder, because many groups seem spooked by blackout and stopped undocking. So you might not see anything but some bots still running in remote renter space areas. But the space of HORDE, Imperium and GotG (in their timezones) is quite alive and blackout for sure improved chances of having fun during nullsec roaming.
---
I hope they add contract management to the app.  It’d be nice to get a notification once someone picks up/finishes a courier contract, and be able to set up an item exchange on them from my phone.

It literally takes zero skill to use fleet warp

Really? Who?

If you're feeling overwhelmed by the massive amounts of info, you'd do well to focus on the magic 14 [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The\_Magic\_14](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/The_Magic_14), work on the tutorial agents, and then just look up the info you need when you get to it.

Welcome back o7

&gt;There shouldn't be *one* version of a nation commander outpost, but 20, each designed in such a way that fucking up is costly
---
Isn't this what abyssals are already though? Every abyssal run is different and some T5s are so hard that it's nearly guaranteed that you lose your ship (although you are overall making ISK since most spawns are not as hard). There's even 3-man frigate abyssals that add fleets to abyssal running. There's also the trig invasion which both have a random component (the trigs you are fighting are random, every fleet is different and there are no obvious triggers) and a fleet component (you often have to fleet up to fight them).
---
I don't see every player jumping on those (even if they have equivalent or superior rewards to ratting) and they are not saving the game.
---
Yep, that is always a good place to go to. You have to know what to expect, and scout a bit, but usually you will find solos or small gangs there, trying to bubblecamp or stuff ...

Derp.

&gt; Go do some faction warfare!

How am I defending bots? If you suspect someone is a bot, report them. That is not defending them in any way. You claim they all warped at once, exposing your stupidity in fleet warp mechanics.

I mean, can you even read bro?

With no super / fax / titan, hell yes.

&gt; I mean, can you even read bro?

You asking this is hilarious ... or ridiculous ... or both ...I literally wrote a whole article about how to determine and abuse the bot behaviour on warping.

how do i put the 2fa code in? if i minimize the app it restarts/crashes

First off precursor ships second off the amount of isk we make should be nerfed and I believe that would solve a lot of what I believe to be problems. I shouldn't be able to invest less than 2 bil and easily make my money back. But it does take a alt if you dont have a friend.
---
I would say not worth it at this point.
---
I agree that to test something you need to do a small change and measure it.
---
But you started with an assumption that they are testing something. They might not even do that :-D I merely suggested that we dont know what they are even testing and what metrics are using, in return you are trying to prove your point that is based on an assumption.
---
Login incentivies they introduced won't hold you online for more than a couple of minutes (or maybe they will?). Just like you pressing a link is one metric and amount of time you spend on a page browsing it is another. They have all the metrics and we have none. There is a lot of stats to measure player involvement. Again, they might not even test for blackout or maybe their test is gonna continue for half a year with all the regular activities, like login prizes, events and such.
---
Based on what i've seen in null space, bots are gone. And again, all we have are our own observations since we have no access to the data.
---
They're not multiplayer though so I'm not sure they really count in this case.
---
Well done!  But don't you say one more unkind word about the rocket kestrel.  :)

I am fervently awaiting Camelot Unchained..
---
&gt; but in reality all the PvP population wants to do is gank PVE players
---
bullshit, you´re just making yourselves easy targets because as you stated yourself: you´re utterly clueless when it comes to PvP.
---
Two realistic options you have: live in npc null or, like somebody else pointed out, C2 with null static. 
---
All ship classes can be used to great effect but the chance of getting dropped increases a lot if you fly BC or BS. 
---
Due to blobs + cynos kiting is the solo/small gang meta in null but brawling can work well with certain ships and if you choose the right targets.
---
Passwords are obsolete, why no fido2?
---
&gt; The trouble is always what mechanics would encourage people to like actually strike out on their own, to fight each other, and to dissolve these massive super blocs. Of course, any such mechanics, whatever it may be, will get immediately screamed about by majority in those groups benefiting from it and fall flat.
---
You aren't wrong about the screaming, but the only real solution I see to super blocks is removing corp/alliance reputations so you literally cannot blue people to expand. Would practically limit sizes to alliance size at that point since while possible to use overview to see alliance corp status, it is inconvenient enough to not be practical enough for large blocs imo.

Looks like they were planning on killing a Fax but nobody (in a sizeable group) had point.
---
No there should be unrollable wormholes (a new connection other then the static) that can go anywhere and maybe one or two in each hole
---
Where are the original silver miner accounts anyway
---
Idk man, it sounded like a bit of a whine about, you know, the fact that you need to take time-costly steps into getting eve risk-free - I merely wanted to present him an alternative and he hits me with 
---
&gt; I have a personal problem with being willingly inept and incompetent. \[...\] if that’s how you like to play the game that’s cool. 
---
what do you answer to that?
---
Lol this is hilarious. Test alliance please join, and pay taxes.
---
Yes no silly games allowed
---
You sound like a nice fellow. /s
---
Did you read the rest of my posts, the ones where I explain how to identify botting behaviour also on warping? This way is proven over many times, if you want to see the victims just look here https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99008988/losses/.
---
That mining farm died to the same mechanics, hunter spooked him into fleetwarp, preset bubbles catched him. If he was a human, he should have seen the new Mobile Warp Disruptors on dscan.
---
It's a drag and drop for moving skills around and you can delete them by swiping in from the right (I'm on Android so there might be an IOS only bug)
---
How is my phone with Android 8 not compatible? It's the most generic Samsung cheapo-phone...
---
What is a "gate cocksucker" ?
---
what phone is it? android 8 is quite old no?
---
&gt;Which I find hilarious because, look at how much worse the numbers could be if it weren't for the free SP events?
---
This is the saddest part of it all.  The data is much worse.
---
You know, Eve ~~is~~  was not just PVP. 
---
But then again that's the only thing CCP actively supports. Talk about a sandbox where everybody has to smash castles or be told that he isn't having fun.
---
the absolute irony in this statement
---
You know you can transport the compressed ore for 10 hulls and 10 cynos + a 10 run BPC to each of your jump points for a 10th of the space or less?
---
Wait got a spod crust left in my brain.
---
Only real choice would to open a new server maybe give titans a boost but make build reqs insane maybe some time gates mats that only a few of can be made a year.
---
i drink the water from tuna cans
---
It needs Android 5.
---
I got the J3 2017 Android 8
---
No clue what's wrong...
---
Only CCP can't fix botting
---
Probably because the web/app devs are not needed for balancing or other ingame stuff?
---
You are right, it's not just pvp, but I believe that even those who never touch pvp might be good to try a change of pace once in a while.
---
I mean, you want to spend any time at all in your life killing a pod of an alpha over and over that doesn't matter one bit if it's banned?
---
In other news, I am turning 40 now and just resumed playing, because I have more time on my hands these days than I did 5 years ago when I quit EvE. So vOv
---
You seem confused.
---
How is taking something away and then giving it back for a daily/weekly/monthly price giving more advantages? In the worst case it's a zero-sum, in any other it's at least increasing the burden.
---
Anyway, I'm just happy that instead of proposing a version that you would be ok with, let's say a delayed local, you went with the insult.
---
&gt;I think this is important because botting has become a huge problem for Eve
---
They moved to high sec. The low sec FW bots still exist.  CCP didn't remove the problem, certainly lowered the isk/hour but the bots still exist.
---
What are they doing, rally points? Link constellation.
---
I said nothing about manual aiming/firing, although in my dreams for the distant future of eve some ships could have this feature. Manual flight can be really useful for maintaining transversal and optimal. The desire for the option to fly manually with responsive controls Is valid.
---
Banned for rmt :(
---
And yet you couldn't recognize a fleet warp. I could write an entire article on Applied Physics and how it proves birds are nothing more than drones. It would not make me an expert.
---
Can u accept my bot alts into corp bro
---
TIL Dscan tells you if a ship on it is a neutral/hostile or a blue so that decisions about hostile status can be made.
---
I never said any unkind word about it? I just simply said I shit fit it. I'm working on Rockets V right now and then rocket spec.
---
T2 launchers and ammo gonna be so good.
---
Is not banned. Are you dense?
---
ty :D o7
---
Might be easy indicator that people don't like the changes. Could be useful metric. 
---
Also we saw the blueprint on the test server days ago, so CCP changed their mind in what, a week? What are you?
---
How would this in any way change what is happening in this video? It's an alpha character with no use other than to warp to gate and look at the overview.
---
Yes actually.
---
you are right, friend. The thing is I feel (i would love to know outright) that the pve things have been made tankier and tankier in an effort to get even the most risk averse out to play. which it succeded and now it s taking it back with the cyno changes. 
---
cause the way i see it - the counter to turtling up under a super umbrella would be the ability of the people to kill things by surprise dropping enough high damage stuff. In the age before caps/supers it meant bombers. Now it means dreads and supers.  
---
So if you were an established group that grew large enough to be immobile, you will raise the indexes, people would know and hunters will try and farm you. The group will lose its meaning and people will try and distribute risk across multiple regions and basically wallet tank the occasional hunter.
---
One hardpoint is a pair of turrets or launchers :)
---
- Lowsec: Amamake is the Gal-Cal FW hub.
---
:thonking:
---
NO
---
He was permanently banned in spring 2019 for isk selling, this is widely known. He made new accounts and switched from input broadcasting to scripts for mining. It is fine to allow botting and isk selling in your alliance but just be honest friend.
---
is that cross platform in-game purchases ? Woot
---
Null Roaming: Delve, Fountain (Imperium), Kalevala Expanse + Malapais (Panfam), Detorid (WC), Omist (Mangoes), Esoteria (TEST), GE-8 (BRAVE Atrons), Tenerifis (Russians), Paragon Soul (Weird Krabs), Feythabolis (Scared TEST Renters), Providence (Get dropped), Cache (Iron Crown bot Procurers and Caracal spam). Have fun.
---
Let's stand back, together... you and me. Not your opinion vs. my opinion.
---
Let's look at things from 30,000 feet up where the details don't matter, only the outcome.   
---
Someone that isn't having fun or isn't able to enjoy the game is no longer playing it. That's all that matters.   It doesn't matter if you agree or disagree. It doesn't matter if you or I think it is valid or not. The fact is, someone else with a different opinion feels a certain way and is no longer playing and saying "good, leave" is about the worst thing any of us can say when we need player population.  
---
As for holding your temper? That guy literally was just using well spoken talking points and it wasn't aggressive at all.  Maybe you are taking things on the internet personally?  
---
You repeatedly said "I don't get it." That's ok and it's not the point. You don't have to understand why he thinks the way he does. He doesn't have to understand the way you think.  What we should do, is at least be sympathetic and understanding to different opinions even if we cannot understand them. People do different things for fun and simply because you or I or anyone might do something different for fun, doesn't mean that other person isn't equally permitted to want to do something different for his fun factor.
---
Now now, that's just getting picky... :D
---
Dropping cans with 10,000 bookmarks and after 10 minutes of being screen locked on a gate, arrive at your death clone. FUN!
---
The statement that you have to put a lot of time into the game to enjoy it is also very much a player created problem. Say you only have 2 hours per day to play the game, you can easily use that time to get involved in a good amount of smaller gang lowsec fights before having to log-off. If you are deadset on not going to lowsec, well you can be part of smaller sigs or groups(wow small groups actually exist, who wouldve thought?) and quickly be on the doorstep to a hostile neighbor. Its easy to say that the game is not enjoyable when pretty much all of nullsec, except one region or two, live with neighbours who have both nips naps and whatever kinds of agreements.
---
Lol no
---
they where also banned from goons a few weeks ago so it might be another guy
---
But at the same status, whether it's your first or your 90th it's the same.
---
Gotta do this by the numbers apparently.
---
Loss is permanent throughout the game.
---
How is it unbalanced? No, really? What makes it unbalanced if you are forced to rat or mine while attending to the client? Remember, your attackers have to find you and in doing so, they often use probes, which you can see in dscan. 
---
I take issue with your claim that it is extremely likely you will die when you undock. If you live in a less dense area, you won't have as many hunters per hour jumping through and should use Dscan. It won't help every time but you're not going to die repeatedly because you're in the hinterlands anyway.
---
 If you live in a more densely populated region, you should have decent intel and still be using Dscan. You will see more roamers but you will usually know about them when they are several systems away (at which point you can dock or take other precautions).
---
Now, I do think the cloaky thing needs some adjusting. Not in the initial attack, mind you. The decloak and gank should still happen. I'd like to see a way for responders to catch the cloaky fleet if they are quick enough. as the invulnerability of the cloak is the only real problem (IMO).
---
Still, that's a small balance issue and believe me, the cloaky peeps will REEE if it's addressed every bit as much as you are over losing total safety.
---
Well, since you are in Templis. Why not set up that time to do some frigate or cruiser gang roams in lowsec, or perhaps npc nullsec? :) theres not much stopping you other than having a few ships ready, and a jump clone in range of content.
---
You are 15 years too late, dude.
---
Welcome back! Good to see more people return.
---
Great sarcasm. Not like any of us have jewd wormholes before to make a few billion isk in a few hours with all entries pushed to critical...
---
Is it just me or are the frequency of dumb ideas increasing?
---
Damn fine drop, son. The loot fairy likes you!
---
Not really. Null is quickly becoming wormhole space
---
Asset safety, Super umbrella protection would like to have a word.
---
For some reason, I was sure this was a battleground for Gal-Cal, thanks to my idiot brain. Updated with better destinations.
---
It's possible to do one thing while saying your doing another.
---
You are missing the point here. What you are asking leads to easier/faster profit. The exact oposite of what they are turning the game into.
---
The lesson you should have learned is: don't go near rens.
---
Yo, I used a software that lets you create custom brackets. You also have to enable the showing of brackets all the time.
---
Unfortunately I did it on a different PC so I can´t give you a direct link atm, but I am pretty sure you will run into it after a bit of a googling.
---
Thanks. OP has a good point though. I never actually realized fully how much of a commitment this game is before I resubbed recently. Or I just forgot, lol.
---
I have no idea who the person in the screenshot is. But again, report bot. Use it if you suspect a bot.
---
a very poor and easy-as-fuck to abuse way ....
---
Stop being an idiot.
---
A reset sounds great in principle, but it'd kill the game for sure.
---
Think about it, you mention WoW classic as an example of how a whole new world would revitalize the game. But, you completely underestimate the differences in the timescale of progress. 
---
Even in classic WoW you could be end-game ready in a month, maybe two depending on how many hours of grind you put in.
---
To get to the point some of the old guard players are at now in regards to skills and material wealth has taken them years, *litteral years*. They have spend years of their life on organizing people, amassing wealth, writing software to support their organizations and building diplomatic relations.
---
You do a reset, you effective wipe out a not insignificant portion of those people's entire life. Even of null bloc life seems cushy and easy, do you think it was easy for those guys to get to  the point they are at now?
---
You take away those guys' progress, I doubt they'd come back.
---
That said, some kind of "natural" disaster that would cause the loss of a bunch of ships and structures, probably wouldn't hurt.
---
Fuck I heard this in real life
---
Very nice pic, thanks
---
this cant be emphasised enough.  
---
peanuts.  
---
stupid low. like 100m collateral, 30k m3, 20 jumps, for 500k isk.
---
Well dont let that discourage you. If you have limited playtime theres still a lot to be done, usually you might just have to organize it a bit yourself also :)
---
Ultima Online is have to agree had the best PVP for older MMOs.
---
The mental gymnastics required to defend someone who's previously been permabanned for RMT yikes
---
Something that is more difficult but fun to do, not something that is easy and boring to do.
---
I think you’re muddling my words!
---
These Bots only augment the old bots used for single accounts in a very poor way. Most ratting bots (still) rely only on local (that is gone) + overview (thus the gate grid pod). 
---
What they don't check:
---
- is the char seen by gate pod in overview on entering system still in system / has he left 
---
- has something changed in dscan 
---
So just enter system, gate pod initiates warpout of ratting ship (bots obv. tied). Find the Anom he was in and the structure he is docked at, place Mobile bublle, wait out rewarp timer --&gt; kill it.
---
There is only one industrial in the game, and that's the Itty V.
---
The struggle exists man. Bedtime at 930 for this guy
---
WoW classic has been out for 24hrs.
---
Quietly spins ship
---
They are shooting they's one foot. not mine. At this point i couldnt care less. It actualy feels good not wanting to play EVE anymore.
---
Alternatively, they could not be morons and avoid this easily avoided problem.
---
The existing ratting and mining rules within the blocs give you an idea of what they’d do with scarcity, and “give everything to the elites” isn’t it.
---
&gt;Managing people sucks.
---
This, not many people like to build organizations. Not surprisingly, people who manage thousands in-game likely have experience doing it in RL.
---
vro i've been playing eve for 6months now and I can't take SOV with my 5 bros.
---
i Think Eve Needs A Wipe
---
look At Classic Bro It Works?!
---
Nonono, you guys. :D 
---
I meant to, but i was not even trying. There is a subtel difference between those two.
---
Hmm, i travel aridia daily, never seen some, must be one of the deadend pockets.
---
Not way back. We used to get texts at 3am that sometime brought in a fleet to attack a POS when everyone was sleeping. That was long before capital ships.     
---
Asset safety and timers were not around a long time ago. If you lost a system you lost everything in it. And it could happen anytime.
---
lol so to you haws are anti everything xD, no im no where near that level of isk, one day maybe. See the thing is balance comes in fitting, if your fit to kill a specific type of ship and you catch it but it kills you, then its pilot error or skill point difference. Whys the cost of a ship relevant to balance? Is that a real question? Why should any body build anything that takes time and effort if it didnt. You must be really sad when a your t1 frigate gets smacked by an assualt frigate, let me guess your next salty post will complain about how your 500,000 isk ship cant scratch a 30 to 40 mil assault frig. Let me guess, you want every fight you take to just work out for you no matter the difference between you and the other guys ship :D, you should win :D, like why should the other guy win if he built to counter your ship type, why should he win if he put more effort into making sure he won :D. I hope you can see the sarcasm, im sorry bro i cant nerf common sense for you. If you simply dont have haws because you dont know how to deal with it then thats on you. Ive seen titans melt to dread bombs, about 30 dreads to 1 titan is like a heated knife through butter. Sorry that you dont have enough friends to hunt one, sorry you cant make the 2 bil too tag along with the guys who do. I'm realllyyyy sorry that your buckets of salt dont control the game meta xD. Mind you, titan haws application where nerfed by like half a lonnngg time ago. Hey go take your t1 battle ship and 1v1 a Marauder, you'll understand how ship cost investment matters. Or better yet, how about you go build a kronos, or a titan, maybe then you'd understand how significant ship cost is. Listen my guy Im allll about balance, I have nothing against it, Im fully against gutting any ship just because some guy doesnt know how to adapt. One thing you should realize is if your level of play is small time, then dont expect to stand toe to toe with the big boys and think youre going to have a good time.
---
But if I do that, on the internet of all places, how can you be sure it's 'clearly' or not?
---
Nerd
---
Using iOS. No problems with 1Password.
---
Not available on a moto G6 either
---
Maybe options would be good, add trust funds while at it.
---
What about a new trig wh, that can be used both ways, but on the other side there is nothing, you cant take isk, skills, minerals trough it, and you have to start new from scratch.
---
The nice thing is, you can always jump back to the old cluster where you still have your skills etc.
---
Its basically like a new server
---
You can do the same thing I will... Once the APK from this app gets out, I will just download and install it!
---
If the phone can run it, it will!
---
If not, you will just be looking at a blank screen filled by a error message that the app closed.
---
Hit me right in the feels
---
No need. Severe resource scarcity would cause internal conflict and collapse most empires. It would thin out the groups who remain in control of the resources as the groups struggle against their own weight. More small/medium scale entities would take form and continue to fracture large groups as they struggle for power. Eventually the server will reset itself into the balance it's meant to be in.
---
Unironically flying a Sigil through HED-GP does sound pretty interesting tbh. For setting up the chain anyway.
---
sitting around for 30 minutes doing nothing.  And at the end, you get to kill a bot that doesn't give a fuck?
---
 ... amazing game play experience.
---
And people wonder why subs are dropping.
---
Lots of garbage.
---
With the new changes coming in? No.
---
Except, I live in null and wormhole space concurrently? Id rather keep my carrier in havens for consistency and safety, and my rorquals in the enormous (and occasional r64). Only dread rat once a week when anoms actually spawn in the hole.
---
Once again you are proving tou have no idea what you are talking about
---
Which is pretty much the problem attempting to be solved. If you don't have a massive cap fleet you don't stand a chance.    Caps should only be useful against other caps. As we have seen in countless fiction and IRL naval battles a massive ship is completely useless against smaller ships. Currently if you invade a cap fleet gets cyno dropped on you and it's game over.
---
Good catch!
---
Try reading the OP
---
public courier contracts: there are people shipping stuff for 200k isk/jump highsec-to-highsec.
---
don't undersell yourself.
---
People don't want to sink their entire life into a game, they want an escape, not another job. They want to play for a few hours, log off, and not worry about it anymore. And they sure as hell don't want to have to have 20 accounts to play the game. How many other games do you need to have extra accounts just to do basic mundane daily tasks? None that I can think of.
---
Squad boi - you try the zombie mod?
---
AHAHA
---
Do you guys don’t have phone ?
---
*it’s a joke*
---
I mean I appreciate your'e having this well needed talk with yourself, but you don't need to think out loud here :)
---
\*quietly waits for next blue ball fleet ping\*
---
Not much to say but lol at all the null Krabs upset. So much opportunity for chaos with ccp ceo's planned changes.
---
We had alliances going full scale against each other this time last year. 
---
The problem is, no one is going to commit serious assets to a lost cause. So, after the goons won and everyone realized fighting them head on was futile, why exactly do you expect anyone to suicide a superfleet? The Tribute war is as close to a full scale war as we’re going to get for a while; fighting over Ihubs is doable even without supercapital supremacy. And we have a similar war going on in the east right now. 
---
People like you seem to think that wars full of glorious battles with people yolo’ing superfleets for the sake of it and no one ever blueballing could happen if one small thing changed. The reality is wars like that never happened, and never will happen. Content denial is always a powerful weapon, supercapital fleets are too important as a strategic asset to risk losing, large battles are always boring f1 pressing simulations even without Tidi, and FCs and logistics people burn out if you ask them to keep going too long. 
---
We’re currently in the middle of a war between pandafam and Imperium + pets. Until pandafam is completely defeated and loses their space to an Imperium friendly alliance, and is unable to simply take more space somewhere else, there will always be that war.
---
same with rattlesnakes. Remember my cheap fit? it's 1.4b each now
---
On its current path it will die, if they stop being batshit insane it might be worth trying out lmao. Why even lie to new people.
---
First of all: It has no benefit. 
---
Then it devalues your time spent farming ISK if you do it through faucets. The more cash people create the less your tick will be worth.
---
I agree with most of this apart from the elephant in the room: (1) Plex and (2) injectors.  (1) brings us the "pubbie" who can PvE to run one or more accounts and (2) brings us the "super pubbie", who can PvE in end-game content in multiple accounts.  With this CCP managed to devalue the two things that are most important in the game: the hard work required to earn (thus the sense of loss when you get capped) and genuine `vet' status, important for long-term players.
---
I got a password manager on my phone and copied the pws over 🤔
---
What I mean is each torpedo launcher model has three torpedoes in it. Only two out of the three actually 'launch' one torpedo per cycle. I'm not talking about multiple launchers here it's the same launcher.
---
You'd expect it to go left mid right left mid right but it goes left mid left mid etc.

Just reset real life lol.
---
!!! I also returned after years for the changes.
---
Too bad Star Citizen (reeeeeeeeee) is still as scammy as usual. I should have splurged in that game naively when I first heard of it. :(
---
You missed something, you cannot take a game how it was 15 years back, put it online and hope for success. Nowdays eve have competitors
---
You mean manually copying and pasting for each of your accounts... That's not Password Manager support... That's copy/paste support...
---
Eve Online will never have a "server is full" message.... coz you know.... its dying and all that....
---
Well I have fun ruining botters days and saving the economy of the game i like from their ISK flooding (at least a bit, everybody can do his part). Luckily I am atm in the position to not just kill their botting ships but also the citadels they use and the ihubs they rely on. Their daddy alliance is shit
---
You deserve this damned upvote.
---
old blanchy didnt have a que, old blanchy is my father
---
Fair enough, can you enlighten me? What do you envision would happen if severe resource scarcity was introduced to EVE?
---
&gt; organizing people, amassing wealth, writing software to support their organizations and building diplomatic relations 
---
The really bad thing is, that only the wealth part would go away. IMO, that is the real reason EVE would not survive a reset.
---
That's the BR I was looking for
---
&gt;Bedtime at 930 for this guy
---
Sounds like an early riser. My alarm goes off at 4:45 and I'm in bed by 10PM. My wife pokes fun at me for being an old man but let's see her get up before the roosters every morning. 
---
I guess I am old-ish, though. AARP have been bugging me to join for a couple of years now.
---
dude, I absolutely get what you're driving at, and I get the dude's plight as well. I'm simply stating there is fun to be had in some other ways (which he outright dismisses by personally calling their, uh, practitioners at least stupid - by my quotes). How is that a well spoken point ?
---
What I initially tried to do was to get the dude back by showing him that I, personally, got to play the game in a way and if the game wasn't fun the way he played it he may be trying my way, as it works for me (as his ways worked for me too, in the past, when I had more time to play). What I got in return was a series of "well spoken" insults. Well fuck him then, with this attitude. 
---
If he (or you for that matter, or anyone else) would take the time to understand how other people think, maybe the bitterness will wear off and people would enjoy what's offered.
---
i brought my vexor to wormhole space yesterday hoping to stand a chance agaist drifters and now most expensive ship i can afford is tristan, and i lost one today trying to get to lowsec

This is a good post.  I get online basically the same 2 hours every single day. If I can be online by 9:15 I will take my friends out on a fleet. If its even 9:20 I do all the wallet/admin stuff I have to for the Corp and then log off for the night. Wasnt quite like that before I had the kiddos and 6AM mornings.
---
The blocs would conquer more space.  If your scarcity is fixed, they use those systems.  If you implement scarcity via depletion, they do something similar to crop rotation.
---
You pop a rock and suddenly every rock in the belt aggros you and starts slamming into your ship. You depserately try to align out, but alas, it cannot be done.
---
You pop a cyno and wait for a rescue fleet of Rorqs and hulk barges to come save you.
---
\*You have died\*
---
I agree with you. I'd like CCP to address the elephants in the room (FW, NPE, Supercapitals, Citadel timers) and then launch a new server instance. I love our shared universe too but the game has 16+ years of legacy content and entrenched leaders that the reality is no new player can ever hope compete against. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised to see months of 100,000+ PCU if CCP marketed a relaunch (new server instance TQ can keep running).
---
Im still butthurt over warhammer failing so hard. It had so much potential that game...
---
To fix that you would need to remove HACs completely, I think. Or buff structures so that it’s impossible to kill them with just a HAC fleet. 
---
Because otherwise you can just take a Muninn fleet and fly around under the guns of all the dreads and Titans in the world and kill a keepstar out from underneath them. There would be no point to ever dropping caps in the first place.
---
I did go from eve to games such as these. That's pretty much what this whole topic is about. People not engaged by spreadsheets online anymore. The UI is not immersive downvote me all you want but its true.
---
Once your neighbors change every few hours by mechanics alone then nullsec will be equally chaotic.
---
Well you already found your way dude
---
Once the bots automate locator agents that won't work.  But I suppose at least the latter costs some ISK.
---
If you aren't trying to keep up the OPSEC and you haven't named yourself Falcorn, Falcon; I'm going to be so disappointed.

&gt; The game NEEDS TO RESET.

The game NEEDS TO RESET.
---
I would actually be down with them powering up a new server with mechanics dating back to 2009-2010. I'd be happy to start over with minimal SP and a long time grind to caps. If they gave each pilot 5M unassigned SP, it'd be plenty to start having fun without causing the balance issues that SP trading has caused.
---
Would be quite an effort, thus I think luxury options like locating chars seen entering system only is viable for larger farms or Super-Bots (idk if they still a thing after blackout)
---
I play every day and I enjoyed the few days off my queue. And I like hillmars ideas. Though I'm a heretic who likes chaos and if I wanted to just farm there are a dozen other games to do it in.    
---
Log in: collect rewards: log off. Most mmo's these days. Get a decent small Corp and it's log in, what y'all doing, and having a blast doing whatever. Abyssals, roaming, missions, combat sites, even drunken mining. The only thing missing is the alliance wars of old.
---
(the browser embedded in the launcher doesn't support it yet. It's a desired feature)
---
The outcome seems a bit inevitable though :)
---
Nah, if they reset the game, I (and I'm sure just about everyone else) is done.
---
I've spent far too much time building this fake little world my fake little character lives in just to have it erased and start over.
---
I know, but at least you don't have to manually type out secure passwords.
---
You spent too much time around people who know how to dodge bubbles....
---
It's also not like people in your group set up bubbles too, for a billion of reasons, so as a miner, I would not be too concerned (maybe a bit more if they in direction of my warpout structure).
---
I have no clue about his other actions, so I will leave this to CCP.
---
No there must be witch hunts everyones a bot unless i can kill them and if i can kill them theyre probably a bot too also youre probably a bot yay blackout and other braindead remarks
---
A reset would literally kill the game.
---
I would like CCP to think about launching another server instance though. It might kill TQ but it will also give an opportunity for a new generation of EVE players to start over from the ground floor.
---
 If CCP fixes some obvious problems (FW, NPE, Timers) it could be more successful then TQ in the long run.
---
It requires you to have a special code on top of having the app installed.
---
Ccp effectively sells sp now through extractors in the cash shop. So they promote the idea that new players can’t have fun fun unless they have a lot of sp to catch up to the vets. But there is nothing worse for the morale of a new player then to use real money to buy plex to get injectors and then more plex to get an expensive ship only to have that ship blown up the minute they undock or jump system into lowsec. 
---
It would be much better if ccp focused on creating real  pvp opportunities for content in the small, cheap, new ship level.  Ccp should be encouraging new players to have fun while they grow as players.  Just as an example - There used to be static ded 1 sites. These sites only allowed frigs in. Sure they were farmed but they were also great places for frig combat. Right now only fw space has readily available locations limited to frig combat. Why not spread similar systems around to the rest of lowsec and maybe even highsec?  Why not have gated combat systems in highsec where if you jump the gate you are flagged available for pvp?  And just to clarify I am not talking about instances - but rather acceleration gates that limit ship type, but are open to everyone. Imagine how much fun new players could have if there was an acceleration gate in a new player system that was limited to nub ships and allowed the new players to shoot each other in their nub ships?
---
an EVE Classic...would not end well.  considering how the game was it would be nightmarish for people.
---
now a version of EVE from say 2010 to 2013 range. yeah that would be sweet.
---
aka a time when there was a reason to go to war (oh Technetium, how many wars it caused.......its a pitty we dont have a reason these days...maybe a return to Technetium supremacy days)
---
-----------------------
---
not saying a wipe. but giving us a reaosn to fight in current eve.
---
-----------
---
You're retarded. Eve is/was HIS game. He deserves to be able to cash out after entertaining us for over a decade, you entitled prick.
---
C'mon! My phone is not that old CCP, wtf?
---
I'm talking famine levels of scarcity. Something to challenge the assets of EVE. Big blocs not just conquering more space but pushing people including their own out of null just to survive.
---
The old one was an outsourced application. Instead of continuing to give money to developers who don't work for CCP, they're now giving it to developers who do work for CCP, and have at least *some* understanding of the game.
---
Wow, this is actual autism.
---
The ability to pause my skill queue on an alt on the same account to switch skill queues will be handy
---
i lost a ship
---
I can't be the only one that thinks the UI is 90% of the reason new players quit
---
&gt; CCP is ~~making changes that some people strongly disagree with~~ throwing mud against the wall to see what works.  
---
FTFY
---
And yet fleets are the primary way for people to get into fights. 
---
Why not make it easier to setup and leave a fleet up? 
---
Why must disconnections cause such complications when they don't need to? 
---
Why not have a fleet beacon or something so it doesn't require a player at all times?
---
Yup, I'm up at 6 so I try to go to bed before 10. After getting my dog, I spend lots of my time with him and by the time I'm done doing adult stuff I hardly want to sit in front of my computer another 2 hours. I don't have time or the drive to go on a fleet for 2 hours to shoot a citadel or nothing (more often than naught) where I can just lay in bed and watch TV with doggo.
---
Good post. Here's one of EVE's biggest problems: It's fucking boring.
---
Everything in this game requires way too much effort for so little reward (reward being gameplay that is not boring as shit). Whether it's PvE, PvP, industry, or traveling from point A to point B, EVE is almost always boring as hell, and it almost always requires a significant investment of time and effort.
---
I think there are some "simple" things that could help (conceptually simple, not technically simple), like dramatically increasing warp speed and acceleration across the board. If literally everything in the game didn't take hours upon hours to do, maybe it wouldn't  be so damn boring.
---
I guess thats why these bots do not recognize dscan changes, as if they run in populated systems they would have to warpout on every blue newbro that decloaks an Astero in a Relic or so. Also the point of defensive mobile bubbles on ingates or the likes.
---
BuT tHe BoTs HTFU aDaPt Or DiE nUlLbEaR

So you say the plan to tackle that Fax was pointless?
---
Tempted on their lifetime subscription but too likely to get burned and only try it for a single.month before realizing I hate it and it's just not the same.

“They’ve gone plaid”
---
this thread is full of fantastic ideas.
---
All jokes aside.. the 3 month slope is 16,000 players less for exactly right now, albeit on a Monday.. but not a weekend. That is INSANE.
---
&gt;makes the game more engaging than simple local counts.
---
Or just develop intel network? Blue eyes?  Log off traps with hyperspatial sabres? No real hunter had any issue with kills since people felt safe.  When people don't feel safe, there's less targets.
---
Sure, now imagine being the 30-50 man fleet that tackles something juicy only for a half dozen titans to be jumped in and start Bosoning.
---
The "no risk" hunting options are taken because you cant take the other options. 
---
I'd love to be able to take even smaller fleets and skirmish over a carrier or Rorq kill with the subcap response fleet. Those fights were the best. 
---
But they dont happen any more, and it isnt because I stopped calling for fleets that can fight.
---
This BR is the best example you can get, as this is the 2nd try of a guy that already was permabanned by ccp on 50 Accounts for ISB-input broadcasting and proven RMT. These are his 50 new Accounts, still in Retris as not trained/injected into his usual Mackinaws
---
I am waiting. All of the people on that subreddit are saying to wait until full beta, and I want to enjoy it.. so I am waiting to relive my Midgard glory days.
---
meh dead game tbh
---
They don't add to the maximum SP
---
Well, my point was that there's gotta be a top and there's no reason it couldn't have been subcapitals... But now you've made me realize if we get superdupercapitals that are big enough we could make them counterable by flying frigates inside and blowing up critical components like some sort of Eve Online Death Star.
---
15k people waitlist on a wow classic realm... i guess 14,9k are eve player.
---
Based on downvote rates, it seems like pvp players will say/accept anything for a free kill. 
---
Normal/covert/freight cynos. Allow all 3. 
---
Stop bending your ways just for your minority crowd that feeds on the other group of players for content.
---
Bought 4 multi character training certificates to train JF alts into the new cyno changes (covert) that no longer need to be trained into the cyno changes due to another cyno change (industrial).   #thxCCP.  Can I have my isk back.
---
So it has a feature that eve doesn’t have. Switch characters that have already logged in. Now if they could as that to the game,that would be great.
---
Idk, all frigates do = approach overheat repeat. Cant play frigates any more, its literally rock paper scissors and short fights. The only advantages for new players i see are faster warp speed (easier to find a fight) and low price. Eve could really use some warp speed buffs for all ships.
---
autofill on 90% of phones these days geez get with the times
---
Surprising. Bots and their makers have adopted faster especially in bot tolerated regions. /u/ccp_falcon
---
I, too, can draw arbitrary lines over a graph.
---
You should be measuring peak to peak, not just wherever you feel like. Yes, there is a decline, but not nearly as much as you're making it out to be.
---
Lol, they could be logged in waiting for that que time!
---
If you use Aurora Store (drop-in replacement for Google Play), you can spoof your device info, so in theory you should be able to download it then by spoofing as a newer device.
---
Whether it runs well (or runs at all) after downloading is another matter of course, but worth mentioning.
---
Hey man props to you for being a rational thinker and thanks for trying to talk this guy down. It looks like he came in here just to argue in the first place. I made a response to the OP saying I strongly agree with some of the points he made, really wasn’t complaining at all, just emphasizing some of the reasons EvE will fade over time. I even told him in my initial response that he doesn’t have to understand it but the guy clearly just got defensive and I guess lost his temper(?)
---
And for the guy seeing red, I’m not looking for a reason to come back to EVE. I’ve left and come back plenty of times. I’ve tried many play styles, I’ve seen all this game can be and it’s beautiful and glorious. My “complaints” weren’t about EVE as a game or certain mechanics, it was the fact that doing everything I wanted to do and enjoying every aspect EVE has to offer is just downright time consuming. If you go through life without understanding that people are going to do what appeals to them because... well it appeals to them(in this case not being a willingly incompetent fool) then you’re probably not going to make very many friends or gain a whole lot of understanding. You picked this battle trying to validate your lack of understanding for my approach to EVE by saying I don’t have to play that way, and if I don’t like it then just don’t play. You must severely lack reading comprehension skills because you completely missed 1. I WANT and CHOOSE to play that way, and 2. I DONT play anymore. 
---
I’m sure someone else on this sub is waiting for your wise input somewhere, so move along. Thanks for playing!
---
Yeah the pithx x-large got expansive :-(  
---
With 3 accounts you could run a a triple leshak setup at 800/900m each
---
Yeah I noticed this overhaul yesterday I know you know what you're doing. Hopefully I can make it to the next charlotte evemeet and chat you up about evewho. Best resource you make in my opinion as a recruiter.
---
It's a Monday to a Tuesday, which isn't a huge difference historically. You can feel free to measure it day to day and share the results. It won't make it look any prettier and arguing it is just semantics. This isn't a eve is dying reeee thread. It's simply numbers.
---
wonder how many are playing WoW Classic.  or waiting for CCP to give us a reason to go to war
---
the only thing it lacks is a fitting simulator, evedroid does that and its pretty handy
---
It’s also boring. 
---
I resubscribed after a year. No more blobs I said. Managed to play for 5 days and found myself spinning again. 
---
Unsub.
---
You can take issue if you like. It's still unbalanced towards attackers. Dscan won't save you against cloaky groups doing drops. It's laughable how safe a group of stealth bombers are. You can fly a cloaky T3 into enemy space with no danger to your ship at all and than cyno in X amount of ships, all the while giving away no intel whatsoever. Why would anyone want to PVE at the moment?(which btw is such a soul crushingly boring activity anyway)
---
&gt; It's a Monday to a Tuesday
---
No you aren't. It's a Sunday to a Tuesday
---
The bots don't care, in regions where bots are tolerated and encouraged like on this [video](https://youtu.be/XN4iK1YM-aU)\-- they just adopt.
---
I feel for you, I have just resumed playing after 5 years away from the game. I'm 54 and now that the last of my 4 kids are in their senior year at college and in getting closer to retirement, I finally have the time to invest in the game.
---
You need to use &gt;1month all started well over the month now.
---
That's brilliant, it would also probably increase traffic in whs because people.would be looking for the shortest distance to hig sec, which is now more spread out.
---
a target might be aligned and one cycle of a large neut might suck off all the cap and the target can warp at the same instant. The small nos is there to minimize that chance to practically none.
---
Good stuff and has the login music? Cool.
---
My idea was more like limit an area to Alpha only skills or something like that. There is still danger since as a new guy you will still encounter gangs and better fits and better pilots. PVE activity would still be a risk at higher tiers. It would also be about letting newer players experience sov style warfare on a smaller scale where a capital alt is not a requirement.
---
I think obviously what I said was pretty general, not a fully fleshed out mechanic
---
You sir, do not know  [Anti-Nub Incorporated](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98199571/). Ninja Uitoh is the CEO. You do not know this player. Reddit can go fuck itself.
---
Too little too late.
---
maybe don't go to sov null dumbass lolol
---
OP's brain is about as smooth as Grathy's.
---
 [Anti-Nub Incorporated](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98199571/)  is an active corporation. You know nothing.
---
I don't think any game is worth dropping out of highschool for.  I do get having addiction in highschool though, I spent too many hours playing EQOA and WoW.
---
meh..... giant wall of text to tell me the obvious, despite even the best efforts of ccp eve these days is premium grade "meh"
---
Actually, you are right. It was a Monday on the 3m I looked at which went from 33k to 17k. I can admit that was in error. I looked at one and jumped to the next. So from a Monday 3 months ago to a Tuesday today, -16k players.
---
would be better if CCP made low sec more interesting / profitable. low sec is the highest risk space atm, and has nothing to gain from it
---
I too take 2 random points and draw a line between them....
---
Anyway, at this rate EVE is dead in 2-3 months, right before winter.
---
The 3 month slope from Monday the 27th at 33,168 to Tuesday the 27th at 17402 players is down 15766 players or 47.5%
---
&gt; That's the cool thing about Eve, nothing stopping you from just setting something like this up on your own.
---
Sure, I've seen something like this in the past, but it requires someone to manage it which like a post above notes, not many have the time to lead a project in EVE these days. This could just be something the game itself could manage instead.
---
As to the blobbing issue, Im not really sure. Limiting max fleet sizes perhaps to start. 
---
True, it would be easy to run T1 all day, but that the point I think. Make combat easy and highly accessible on the lower tier
---
Look at the 3 month slope. Tell me again it's two random points and meaningless. Tell me that in an honest manner.
---
Yeah but the goon candidates will just switch to init before application dead line......
---
the game is dreadfully boring for those who want to make things happen
---
the game should incentivize people to go out and fight each other in every way
---
I think the pack sales were to inflate their numbers for sale. I don't see those happening again as PA tries to realize ROI
---
Hi, how did you know I am a huge fan of https://www.de.wikiloops.com/musiker/Grathy.php ?
---
Could erase high-high holes but add a number of dual-highsec static C2's or something with short hole duration.
---
Perimeter to Hek is either 45 jumps or 1 through a C2.
---
I think you need the normal Interface to play properly. 
---
What would propably help would be an automatic Camera, like the Game Star wars Empires at war had, that could be enabled in the Options Menu (since it would eat more CPU/RAM with the camera active). Some control windows would be visible on Mainscreen and the Output of that Camera would be recognised as a Camera in your OS so you could easily include it into your Streaming Software.
---
Yeah blizzard has stated medium pop realms today have more people than back in the days full servers max load
---
Assuming OP is true (I think it is), then EVE is not salvagable.
---
The only way out is for CCP to create a new game with elements that make EVE compelling (scifi sandbox, meaningful losses, risk-v-award) but is consistent with modern player expectations and playstyle, and allow time for players to migrate over a time so that player organizations can survive.
---
I really hope CCP has a secret skunk works team working on the next generation EVE.
---
Grow a pair lol
---
have your tried getting good at the game
---
For me eve feels 'solved'. 
---
You want to do anoms? Heres the ship you need.
---
You want to gas mine? Do this.
---
You want to mission? Heres the exact guide with all the triggers.
---
Pvp? Join a zerg.
---
Incursions? There is a guide for that.
---
You can plan out your isk per hour to the decimal point if your mining.
---
Exploration is the only randomness factor in pve.
---
I like this app so far. Much more useful than their first attempt. The UI is pretty solid and the functionality is useful. Some observations though.
---
- you can buy things on the New Eden Store with Plex but you can buy Plex with $$$?
---
- the back arrow/button shelf on the bottom on my pixel 2 disappear using the app. This makes it harder to switch apps (like me using lastpass to get my login info) or hit the back button.
---
- the ad for the shift skins don't actually take me anywhere. It would be nice if clicking on adverts for things in the NES would take me to that page in the app.
---
and nothing of value was lost
---
you run the risk of dying the moment you undock in null
---
Any well prepared group will kill you
---
new pilots are strong at heart. They fight and fight.
---
so then why are you on reddit making the things worse?
---
Looking at the 5 year slope, we have been at this point before.
---
"Well I have fun ruining botters days and saving the economy of the game"
---
sadly, you are doing neither.  But, that said, if you enjoy doing what you are doing, then more power to you.  Have fun.
---
Or, I could go and have fun.
---
“One downside of this is of course that as a game engine, if its latest features are to be utilized to their full potential, we have to stick to a recent engine version, which means that Portal will not continue to be compatible with some older smartphones that the old version of Portal can support.”
---
From the dev blog
---
I don't  trust your linear regression.
---
Your graph is bad and you should feel bad about yourself. If you're going to manipulate data to fit your shitty narrative at least do it right.
---
Here's a more accurate depiction of what's happening: https://i.imgur.com/71IVlwf.png
---
I hate upvoting on reddit
---
but it is funny the same people who post “die krabs” “fuck your safety”
---
come in DROVES to spam “wormholes are so dangerous and hard :( so much skill nobody can live it’s so hard you don’t get it k?”
---
There wouldn’t be so damn many people doing it and defending it if it was truly that unviable , remember that
---
I have that code.
---
I just can't get the app.
---
Play store just says item not found.
---
Eve's playerbase has ALWAYS been older than most other games.
---
Can't get podded out anymore unless you forget to use Jump Clones.
---
Convenient that you would pick a US national holiday for that set of numbers.
---
If you pick the sunday may 26th, you get a peak just shy of 34k. Compare that to sunday august 18th, with a peak of about 30k, you only get a decline of 4k players over two random comparable days.
---
Still a decline, yes. But not nearly as bad as you're trying to make it sound.
---
So basically just log off traps and awoxing.
---
Any other item results in all but the most incompetent getting away because of the strong imbalance.
---
never underestimate the amount of autism eve players are willing to put in to get a dank frag
---
they will dscan out your hidey holes and then have probers waiting to hit you
---
lol WH's are for PI and PvP. And the occasional gas site.
---
And i live in wormholes since forever. So there i am more right, also i too can lie on the internet just like you. 
---
Delete WH space its useless and only 20 max 30 people live there anyway.
---
They dont have to “fix” it. Just keep tweaking and changing the dynamics so the meta is always shifting so that by the time everyone adjusts to how its broken, its already changing again.
---
I will take that.
---
you advocate for the maintenance of the status quo and then tell me that you want what's best for the game. We know where the status quo will take us: to serenity.
---
you cannot say something like that and not share your recipe fuckup
---
Nice. :) I approve.
---
Get a Machariel and you have a chance of 2-3 bumps pushing him out of drone range, and then you can scoop his drones. Not worth it unless Augmented or Harvester.
---
I appreciate that the app has some new functionality.. But why the fuck couldn't they just update the app they already have?  Why did it need to be a new one?
---
Tbh if you posted the dev challenge from another account it might have gotten upvoted, reputation is a killer within an edgy community.
---
But id add a challenge.  Someone from CCP grind up a titan of their own with no dev help or plex from a new account.
---
See how “easy” they are to get casually compared to the frigate roaming playstyle they seem obsessed with
---
How am I to know some dude has been banned if he is on new accounts? I'm not friends with them and getting their character names like you.
---
&gt;because almost every corp i know cannot replace a director even if he is already half assing the job
---
Sounds a lot like RL tbh.
---
what if i already did that this week?
---
I know, thats why this is one loophole to kill them. Currently iI mostly stumble over bots using 1 system exclusively, they would live much safer when checking dscan.
---
Thats not nearly as much fun as new toys though.
---
Give us more tech 2 and tech 3 variants of caps and super caps. Or fuck it, or even a whole new class of ships bigger than titans.
---
Adjust both the resource faucets, and the resource sinks.
---
EVE players getting in line to play WoW. What a time to be alive...
---
IM HOOKED ON PHONICS!
---
Yeah, too many carebears out in null.
---
Here is an additional image, for people calling it arbitrary. From Monday the 27th of May to Tuesday the 27th of August. 3 months. The exact same time of the day on two days that are typically very close (not a weekend). We've all heard that there are less during the summer. Now we are hearing there are less back to school. There is a lot of "whatabouts" but it's still a numbers game.  
---
[](https://imgur.com/a/wwN1q04)
---
Nothing stops you from doing it again!
---
Grumble grumble floating Nyx.....
---
Also, we can even go so far to wait until today's peak to make it peak to peak and it's not going to get much prettier.
---
What a coincidence that this "other guy" has the same pattern (49 Mackis that are atm Retris because not skilled up yet + 1 Hel for Rats) in the same corp ... c'mon ... do not insult the people, some of them are not that dumb ...
---
What?  You don't have any clue do you?
---
You know what's convenient? Every single time any numbers are posted, there is a reason that they are vastly less. I'm curious, will those reasons ever run out?
---
No shit, sunday peak to monday/tuesday two hours after downtime results in a 50% drop of logged in players?
---
Jita - 404 not  found
---
totally not banned or anything like that
---
&gt;  which is hard for new players? 
---
For me it's just a PITA to train the alts up so that all can sit in a recon. The cost of losing them is also an issue as I'm no longer able to play enough to replace recon after recon.
---
 I'm not quitting the game over it but I do think I'll be dumping most of my caps in the near future and keeping only a couple for fleet calls. In a lot of ways that's a good thing because I'm tired of caps/cloaks online. Let's have some T1 subcap fights for a change.
---
Speak for yourself, friend.
---
The 3 month is a Monday to Tuesday.
---
The 3 month slope is 33000 players to 29000 players. You should learn how to read graphs.
---
Well, I did not refer to "how" he warps, but to "when" timed exactly in 5 minute intervals to the second ... looks very manual to me ... i can literally picture tha guy sitting in front of his 50 Accs., looking fiercely at a stop watch and then alt-tabbing through 50 Accs. in about 2 secs to undock them ...
---
Works on G5, so yeah might be an old phone thing.
---
Just imagine... all those fleets that have been bombed over the years... it's like we have been overlooking the botting menace this whole time when it's been right in front of us!
---
is almost like data analysis is complex or something. real life advice: stay away from it in the future.
---
Eh what? You mean the years of max krabbing with 1 war per year was "just pvp"?
---
There are people available to lead and organize, they are the ones running the blocs. Again, there is nothing stopping the members of those blocs from pushing for their leadership to do something like what you are suggesting. 
---
We as players of Eve have the freedom to do almost anything, we can establish and run our own markets, we can set up wars and seriously change the political landscape and we can completely wreck the economy if we so chose. CCP has given us the freedom to do all of those things, but for some reason peoplechose to sit out deep in null doing the same thing over and over again, while complaining about Eve being stagnant.
---
That's what weirds me out the most, to be honest. A significant portion of the "Eve is dying"-crowd are members of the large blocs they blame for the stagnation.
---
Seriously, you want to see change in Eve? Start leaving the blocs, you are free to do this. But no, people keep whining on here and on the forums for CCP to fix the issue, but they have the power themselves.
---
That's may point - the app doesn't support autofill...
---
Sort of like you and grammar?
---
Yeah I came here to say the exact same thing. The development of another leadership Corps to follow up on your guys who are already doing the job is actually incredibly difficult. This fact holds true not only in real life but also in game. Well we've been able to do is to build a community that encourages people going out on a limb and trying to lead fleets. There's no hard restrictions or limits or red tape and we don't limit anybody other than their ability to plan and be creative. But that sort of maturity does take actual maturity. And it's not something that is easily found both in the real world and game so why are as we are in a relatively good spot now we weren't in the past and I know the large amount of hard work we've done to get here.
---
There's no secrets here it's just something you have to learn preach and practice.
---
yes.
---
Go to WoW forum with the rest of your Blizzard fans!!!
---
*It's a joke*
---
Eve is what you make of it. You don't have to do anything, or you could buy 100 frigs and get into faction war. I stopped worrying about isk long ago. Too many people try to be wealthy and simply forget to have fun. 
---
Another problem is there is so much you can do, but you won't know what you enjoy until you do it and that takes time. 
---
What Eve needs are more ways to cause chaos and conflict. The number of K-space to K-space wormholes should be increased by a factor of 10. 
---
Eve should also be constantly changing. New regions every year. System security changes. Gate changes. Planets and moons dying. Planets and moons being born.
---
It works for me
---
I love giant fleet battles, where very pilot counts towards failure and victory.
---
Fuck yeah, now I don't even have to log in Eve, can just play skill queue simulator from my phone
---
No, but whenever someone wants something to change it's always "do PVP"
---
Man, you have a creative imagination. Consider becoming a writer. I know where the status quo takes us, and I don't want to go there either. 
---
The idea that OP lifted from Facebook needs polish. I pointed out an area that needs polishing. You tried to apply some polish, but it didn't work. Me being against *your* part of the idea doesn't mean I'm against the idea as a whole... nobody thinks you're that important. 
---
Go try again with a different way of fixing that problem.
---
Can’t we love both (:
---
Unironic who?
---
Why not grind rocks while you wait 50 minutes in queue to then grind psychotic pygmy fish people?

So there goes like 95% of the people then.

Suggestions that EVE implement something like pvp battlegrounds from WoW, where you click a button and get queued up for some quick and dirty pvp action, are met with mindless rage. It's not just that particular idea, but virtually anything suggested to address to issues OP raised, other than "make krabs even easier to kill!", is met with indifference at best.
---
Then again, CCP's version of battlegrounds would probably be one team full of pvpers who actually queued for the battleground vs a team of people who were mining, afk docked, or logged off.
---
and they will be back or just move to another region.  The only thing that ends up fixing the bot problem is if CCP actually steps up and works on a solution.  Until then it will continue to persist.  And again, if you enjoy it, then have fun, but bots are a problem that the playerbase can't fix by themselves.
---
K bud.
---
Keep drinking the kool aid.
---
"you try to pop a cyno, but realize that you're not in a black op battleship and your cyno doesn't work anymore, and you won't get any more hulk babies with your Rorquals".
---
&gt; Go try again with a different way of fixing that problem.
---
how about no. because i won't actually make any kind of impact.
---
Notifications for when your PI extractions expire would be nice
---
Sure - a programmer can add a delay loop for inputs, but someone doing input broadcast won't.
---
I'm all for getting Eve to extend it's life for another few years.  Problem is too many mistakes were made and the last 5 years of development got us to stagnation.  No Eve can't be saved and really, as an MMO it's lived beyond it's years.  It's time to look forward and not back --- take the lessons learned and start with a clean slate.    I don't mean leave Eve to die, I mean create a path to a new star system and let members migrate from New Eden to New \_\_\_\_\_.   I think it's time.
---
Wow...you're full on retarded why the fuck did I reply to you? :S
---
That is true, but one can start making a change and be persistent towards CCP
---
“Better to bear those ills we have, than fly to others we know not of”
---
So the takeaway is that the app still doesn't have ghost fitting?  God damnit, why is it that EvEdroid had the best ship fitting, but never got updated.
---
Accidently bombed my own bombers wing, but it was cool because everyone could not stop laughing their asses off. Then we 3rd partied one of the biggest fights of the year in 01Y-ED was a good week.
---
It said that to me 10mins after I downloaded it when I had left the browser tab open. Maybe they've temporarily taken it down or Google is having issues with the store.
---
Honestly if you keep posting how to identify bots all it does is make the programmers better.
---
It's not my job to wade through the posts that you've decided to spread your information over.
---
If you'd have updated your OP with relevant info initially, then this chain of conversation would have been completely avoided.
---
Regardless, thank you for updating the OP, even if it was condescending and still doesn't get your point across very well.
---
I see an absolutely mind blowing amount of random unsolicited opinions. I don’t see anyone asking or caring who’s unsubbing
---
&gt; Without a solid reason, alliances will never go balls deep into warfare, knowing that the risk far outweighs the rewards. 
---
And thats the problem. As long as people think they need to be some internet leader and hold tight to that power they won't do shit. Why not do it for fun? Like in having fun playing a game.
---
And the next problem is what we saw in the last "war" where Goons deployed with way to many people for the enemy to fight back. As long as every new player that comes gets direcvted to "join horde/test/whatever" we just get 2 massive alliances and becoming Serenity.
---
Zz
---
I was going to reply to this by pointing out how bad your data analysis is, but you're doing a better job of pointing it out than I could ever hope to.
---
Hmm...kids are reduced to begging on reddit for people to undock and feed them free killmails.
---
The blackout is proceeding as predicted.
---
It’s two random points and meaningless, and also you’re dumb.
---
Because you and others who post here didnt go past hi school and got no clue about basic methodology.
---
lol at the procurer still mining away like nothing is happening
---
So you won't do anything, but you're upset with the status quo? 
---
*Riiight*.
---
“No more blobs”... That means no blobs. 
---
Smartyboi.
---
Also chat to get pings from in-game while at the grocery store.
---
Is it compatible with the new cyno changes?
---
I guess i'm biased since my alliance is small so we  don't drop caps so by the time the subs get there the carrier is long dead and they fuck off ironically the big blocs and big wh groups always run it's the smaller corps that have the balls to fight
---
Low sec has local. Highest risk in your dreams. Low sec isnt inherently higher risk than null. It is only high risk because of player entities dropping caps everywhere.
---
I'm sympathetic to the argument that covert cyno drops and the ships that use them have balance issues. I've suggested that cloaks should get a 5 minute cooldown after jumping through a cyno or after aggression timer ends. This won't help your PVE loss but it might make the drops more risky in there's a support fleet nearby.
---
Serious questions:
---
How many PVE ships have you lost since the blackout began? 
---
How many hours have you PVEed in null since the blackout?
---
What would you estimate is your risk to isk ratio?
---
Who said anything about unsubs?
---
The company simply needs to concentrate on EVE and not every shitty side game that invariably is utter shit. But these are the guys that made their ground combat shooting game on the fucking PS3 instead of the PC or both for some God damn reason.
---
There are more fun ways of using alt than waiting for 30 minutes.
---
You are incorrect. I did JF for a long time and got rid of mine after the change was announced. I'm not upset that they changed their minds...I was fine getting out of that game, but for actual courier services the change had very little impact other than "now my cyno alts have 45-47 more days of training to do the job they do today". Covert Cynos for JF are only useful for forward stagings or trying to jump it somewhere for logistics purposes. Standard JF Couriers don't care about that at all.
---
As an example: I have 5 cyno alts around the galaxy that have a stockpile of 50 Cyno mods and 90k+ LO a piece. If someone were to kill my cyno alt (which honestly happens very rarely) it wouldn't matter to me at all. The JF is always safe, since it's jumping citadel-to-citadel.
---
I was really hoping it would show the status of industry jobs, market orders, transaction history, and PI extractor status.
---
Though, being able to edit the skill queue is really nice. Looks like I'll be using two phone apps for now depending on which functionality I want at the time.
---
Yessir, i am a simple man.
---
I'm typically not one to bash CCP in here but this is pretty fucking stupid. Particularly the need to somehow seed t1 industrial around to use JF. 
---
This is astoundingly stupid.
---
A corp mate came back from a break, ran 30 ish t5's, never once saw a pvp gate, disconnected on time 31, died and hadnt made his money back on the ship.
---
He is now back on a break. There is potential in trig's stuff, but it needs another few passes. Something CCP is famously good at.
---
Why bother making models when you can 3d print the ship?
---
Make a new corp...? Huhhhhh
---
Yeah, I downloaded the old app by accident as well. I searched "Eve Online" and downloaded Eve Online Portal, made by CCP games. That is the wrong app. :(
---
You didn’t abandon them. U did right
---
You sound salty af, get a grip.
---
Sounds like a bug to report. I was able to use the android task switcher to open up the authenticator.
---
As a workaround, the authenticator codes are good for 60s. Get the code, then login, don't tab out.
---
Not I, for I am a wormholer (btw)
---
Then why am I able to see structures on zkill today that are dropping billions in loot?
---
I haven't lost any pve ships, I don't really pve. I make isk from reactions. The rest of my time in the game is spent deployed abusing the very same game mechanics I am arguing are too op.
---
Well the question is, if your goal is the journey, or the destination. The destination seems to be something everyone is currently bitching about.
---
Nice one!  Bet you’re hooked now!
---
&gt; Maybe I'm reading into this \[...\]
---
&gt; t any pve ships, I don't really pve. I make isk from reactions. The rest of my time in the game is spent deployed abusing the very same game mechanics I am arguing are too op.
---
So you literally don't have any idea about what you've been talking about. Got it.
---
The flaw is that EVE is really a tactical game, with the catch that you only play one unit (per account, I am well aware of alts and group leaders/FCs having to command more)
---
In any other game, you would just send out a squad of hulks for mining, assign an industrial command ship for boosts and call it a day, with your only worry moving the resources back to your base.
---
In EVE you need to play the SCV, Villager or whatever and accept go back and forth until you don't need any more minerals (hint: you always need more minerals).
---
Battles are the same: You click "attack" and either win or loose. Sure, manual piloting/module management/fleet tactics might give you and edge, but in the end EVE is  a macro game. It doesn't matter if you kill 5 ships for every one of your enemies if your enemy is just building 10 new ones.
---
With the permanent loss of items and shps, your grind also never stops. Everything you do ingame is for the purpose of either aquiring materials to build and equip your ships or earning ISK to just buy them. If you don't lose much, you do not have to spend so much time grinding to replace stuff.
---
I find it hard myself these days to go for the grind and sometimes just spend the whole EVEning just looking for new fun in the game. Not saying I am really successful so far...
---
/thread
---
congratz!
---
100%.  I played it enough back in the day to know I never want to go through that again.  WoW was a pleasant gaming chapter in my life, but I've moved on and I could never go back.
---
Congrats you got trolled by a pod. 
---
Obligatory bot word
---
3k++. 
---
We should have a competition.  100 plex to the winner of fastest bump of an orca. 
---
D
---
They never said what metrics though.
---
For me his numbers are realistic - as i play during this online spikes.         
---
I feel those online drops.
---
I do actually because I do all these things I am talking about. You just seemed to think I was on the receiving end, not the other way around.
---
First of all - I totally support the notion that people should go out and do things. That's a good thing. People should do things. 
---
That said, it seems what you are implying I should go do is PvP. I have no interest in PVP. 
---
Don't get me wrong here, I understand that PVP is an integral part of Eve and I respect your right to do so, even if you do it against me when I don't want to be PVPed. But PVP is not why I play Eve.
---
If you shoot at me I'll totally shoot back (if I am able) and to a certain extend I would like it f you showed up to shoot at my mining ops. Mining, while comfy and casual as hell, does get a bit mindless at times and having to actually worry about organizing security would make it way more rewarding for me.
---
What I enjoy doing is cooperating with people and building things. I like the idea that me and a couple of others can spend time organizing and doing industry and then after a while we have a cool house in space. Did we get there in the most optimal way? No, we could have just plonked down a huge chunk of cash, gotten 10 alts each and just bought the thing, but that is besides the point. The cool part in building your own stuff is that **you** built it, the time **you** spent organizing logistics and doing spreadsheets turned into a cool citadel that people can use.
---
I know I'm probably  weirdo, but I actually **enjoy** managing people, setting up logistics and doing all that boring carebear stuff. I don't care that I could do it way more efficiently by simply getting 18 rorqual alts and doing it all by myself, but I have no interest in doing that.
---
1. None, i lost more PVE ships with no blackout
---
2. A lot of hours
---
3. not applicable
---
Check out [the sick slope before the blackout](https://i.imgur.com/7meVs1r.png) when everything was fine
---
Null is a lot more higher risk because of BO.
---
Thank you for this wonderful contribution to the community, sir.
---
From responding to w's in standing fleets, it looks like people lost a ton of stuff in the first couple weeks and then just gave up. I think that's particularly true for subcap and carrier ratting.
---

---
For Frig Abyssals it was like that from start, because of your 2 fleet buddies.
---
&gt;How many PVE ships have you lost since the blackout began?
---
None, only using ships with covert cloak for pve
---
&gt;How many hours have you PVEed in null since the blackout?
---
Maybe 20? Being very selective on activities and times
---
&gt;What would you estimate is your risk to isk ratio?
---
No risk, only doing things where enemies cannot easily engage, such as deadspace sites. Plus using scout on said gate.
---
I miss when you used to make funny shitposts instead of just cry
---
People move on with their lives and change jobs, I think you are reading way too much into that simple fact.
---
Love it! A giabt step in the right direction! Now add a fitting tool and contact list à la smartphone and we have an app I'd gladly use to replace all the third party tools with.
---
We're all dying.
---
at least you're dedicated to role-playing the terrified, battered blackout victim
---
F
---
Ill play.
---
1) zero PvE ships lost. All were shelved day of blackout start.
---
2) 20-30 minutes of total pve the last month to collect daily SP bonuses
---
3) risk - isk ratio = 0:1 (I now buy/sell and making loads of isk completely risk free. Also sold over a hundred recon ships the day cyno changes were announced)
---
4) no losses due to no pve. Did lose a Loki and BNI on fleet ops, both SRP so pvp losses are at zero.
---
All in all I'm doing pretty good. Logging in for the odd ping for content, and to collect my free shit
---
Why not add a video capture ship. No high slots un-targetable. No need for using overview. Just able to join fleets for recording ops. Cool camera controls and gets special credit on kill mails. Would be great for YouTube and twitch.
---
Make cloaking devices require a fleet effort then
---
"Hi" school is it?
---
Not won't do anything, can't do anything. I make suggestions to make myself feel better about it not because i can do anything about it.
---
yes I know, I strongly think about it. Full shak or a mix nestors/shak, easier to multibox.  
---
But I still have my faithfull tinker rattles, I will keep them until you come to gank my ass =P
---
Because it's possible means that it always happens right?
---
So, you are saying that CSM candidates representing alliances should be in those alliances for longer than a year?..
---
An excellent post up until you talk about the cyno change.
---
Making the game accessible or playable in short sessions is different from allowing you to roam new eden in a supercap alone or to move all your assets on a whim anywhere in the galaxy.
---
The game has become smaller, and with it increased the player "density".
---
When I started playing EVE, I was in a small corp, and 10 men in fleet was the weekend event. And we faced comparable opponents. I then moved to FW space, and it was even lower in scale. And I would be able to play in short sessions.
---
You seem to be blinded by your experience in recent nullsec where nothing short of a 50men fleet content exists. Because of the reduction of the size of the game.
---
Dynamically speaking, small groups will grow. And with growth the chaos will decrease, and any meaningful activity will require more work. But that doesn't prevent these large groups to collapse and allow the rise of new smaller entities. In forest it takes a wildfire for the cycle to begin again. The chaos Era could very well be this wildfire.
---
Game industry changed, but so can EVE, but first it has to get rid of the people screaming against any change and preventing any new entity to grow.
---
If the galaxy can become big again, small entities may grow, and in a small entity, you don't need 20h per week to do anything. You don't need a supercap to have fun. A new cycle can begin.
---
eh they did the same with everquest back in the old old days
---
&gt;  i lost more PVE ships with no blackout
---
I think I'm pretty much even with pre-blackout losses but I'm a bad. :)
---
You must work for a TV channel as the statistic guy. Quality graph and very accurate. Can be trust.
---
From what I've heard the perks are good at CCP but the pay is a bit crap. Perks are awesome but sometimes you need money for those big purchases in your life
---
Enter system. Covert cyno friend in off scan of pod scouts. Exit system.
---
Someone “coming back to eve” to make changes that greatly favor one group over another was a warning sign
---
But there’s no changing it, and let’s be real.  Hilmar, Falcon, and especially the people that profit off their agendas will *never* bend or change their minDs
---
So just roll with it
---
What is the central premise then?
---
Still waiting for highslot-mounted cat ears...
---
You don't even know. CCP already said they have metrics which say activity is increasing at phenomenal rates while MAU ( lolwut? ) is the highest in like forever.
---
My, would you look at all those pve players no longer logged into to provide targets for pvp players. 
---
**There's still content!** says the increasingly nervous pvp player that screamed for blackout and can't be wrong.
---
wormholes are better anyway
---
I can't imagine the commitment you need to successfully run a corp, yet for 8 years. All the best!
---
To amplify this, Goonswarm exists because we have a trust fund party boy sociopath and his cadre of variously focused autists running it.  The front line direkkktorate changes constantly as new people with time on their hands come and go.  The membership subs and unsubs as their life and whims allow.  But that core keeps burning.
---
Zero. By ccp’s desire i got rid of all my vnis and barges and moved to strictly capitals when in null defensively. 
---
You can’t beat or catch a smart bomber multiboxer
---
You can’t beat or catch a risk averse t3c
---
But they sure as hell can easily beat and catch vnis, myrna, domis, gilas, barges, or anything they want really.
---
It’s just the new meta, go capitals or deal with losses more often
---
My ratting alt is using an Ishtar somewhere in TKE, I haven't done much ratting because atm I don't have that much time to play and I'm confortable with my isk reserves which I use to PVP... but let's say something like 4/6 hours a week on average since the Blackout started.
---
Never died, but had a couple of lame tackling attempts and one or two close calls that were really fun.
---
Main difference for me is that since the Blackout I'm getting less isk because I can't just release drones, orbit and go do something else around the house while looking at intel channels from time to time; no I have to at least be near the keyboard. 
---
I'd say that's a great and possitive change for the game, even if my lazy afk isk making activity got fucked.
---
"Managed to warp his ships simultaneously into preset bubbles. "
---
You also stated to me you weren't there, you are up North, so your knowledge on the timing is suspect. Like I told you, I will report them, even get them kicked from GSF, but you have also not provided even a scintilla of evidence of botting or that this person is the previously banned player.
---
In-game pings for fleets? The heck?!
---
I don't give a shit about the destination. I'll never be the best at Eve, I'll never fly a titan or even a supercap and I don't give a shit.
---
I like hanging out with my buddies, shitposting in corp chat and getting neat ideas about what to do and then doing them with however much efficiency we can manage (which, usually isn't a lot).
---
I have fun.
---
I've been ratting with a Gila since blackout. Still 0 losses and I've gotten jumped plenty of times.
---
So you want people to switch to "small" groups in null, but you also want to drive everyone out of null.
---
What the hell is your end goal?  And how that small group supposed to hold an entire region in order to get enough resources to support itself?
---
Amazing.... everything you just said was wrong.
---
You are right, we don't know. They are making a statement based of metrics they aren't showing us and aren't quantifying.
---
Delegate or Die.
---
The problem with this world is in this generation every loser is now a winner. Every failure is a success. Instead of having a drive to get better where the fit will survive and the meek will perish, we have a world where everyone is equal and entitled to their share of everyone else's pies. Skill, willpower, knowledge it no longer matters because you can instead demand everyone else carry your sorry ass along on their shoulders. 
---
Worthless generation of me me me me me me me me
---
I know, right! I almost drew the line even steeper.. but I figured it would be called out for satire a little too quickly. Almost on the money I think.
---
Ok.
---
Evaian here. Are you talking about your NBSI alliance?
---
I think I've seen you in FW space as well, I'm usually in a gang of 3 or 4. and we just plex in high traffic areas hoping for fights. Tried some solo with a Tristan but died to ridiculous solo pilots in your corp.
---
No no no. This is all fake. You have to look at peak to peak of the third day of the 2nd week on the full moon only and anyone missing is obviously botting and not missed and anyone else was just an idiot that didn't pvp anyway.
---
This is a great idea, not just for mobile but the game client as well. Such a pita to log out, log the other character, pause, log out, login, etc.
---
Rote Kapelle is Recruiting
---
You are confusing the type of space with the group size operate in them --- group size has no relation to whether someone can play with fragmented time periods whatsoever. Wormholes tend to have small corps, yet they tend to require the most rigid time schedule and most effort. FW and lowsec tend to have smaller groups that do things on a whim, but then you also have groups that do organised effort and capital fleets. HS tends to have solo players or really small corporations that are more casual. And of course in null, you have people who devote a lot of time, like the management, and the people who are just paying taxes and doing minimum amounts of PAP needed. The problem is the majority of EVE's playstyles require consecutive blocs of time, even in lowsec you aren't guarenteed a fight in an hour's game time; and then eventually you will have to ship your ammo/ships and that alone is likely to take an hour.
---
Your proposition that larger groups make things more time intensive and difficult doesn't make sense to me --- if they do make things more difficult for members why aren't they disintegrated already? It just doesn't hold up. It sounds like you are desperately promoting smaller groups and forgot why large groups exist in the game (and in general).
---
When we were attacking  TEST keepstar in perimeter, someone was doing this to our leshak blob. It was by far the best defense. the keepstar then would primary the leshak that was flying away from group because we couldnt rep it anymore
---
If you were aiming at a KS, I do believe that you missed..
---
Maybe a bit unrelated but i wonder why people in eve can own an unlimited number of large (unpackaged) ships without any kind of upkeep costs. Arent there crews to pay? Fuel and operational costs?
---
I be out in FW space hunting bots. So fucking many of them.
---
Today all I've seen are Tristan bots, yesterday was all Ventures.
---
But we have blackout like in WH and cyno changes are coming!       
---
It will be better now.           
---
**/s**
---
Nobody cares about killboards, least of all me. I'm also going to blow my shit up in the next few days.
---
The three month showed that at 9am EST / 1300 EVE on Monday the 27th of May, which was in EU heavy time zone (hint: not a damn thing to do with a US holiday) there were 33k people playing and at 9am EST / 1300 EVE time on on August the 27th (today a Tuesday) there were 17,402 people playing. Please tell me how that's not a massive decline. I'll wait.
---
You mean pve is solved.
---
You've never properly pvp'd have you?
---
What part of the url are you copying ? whatever I try it doesn't work for me.
---
Any chance you could give me a link, or are you telling me to find it on my own? If so, then can you tell me when the resizing happened so I know which old forums to search?
---
no
---
Lol
---
itt: bads wishing the game wasn't hard and 1st day shit fit rorq pilots find each other on a role playing website, unite, and have gay intercourse
---
A corvette is free, frigates are cheap, especially meta or T1 fit. Nothing can stop you from blowing up ships.
---
&gt; which was in EU heavy time zone (hint: not a damn thing to do with a US holiday)
---
Do you know why that's an EU heavy time zone? Because US dudes are typically at work during that time. But it's a US holiday, so they weren't at work.
---
Do I actually have to explain how holidays work?
---
IMO it peaked in game mechanics in BC, and peaked in PvE content in WotLK.
---
WotLK started the dumbing-down of the game mechanics, which tarnished the expansion a bit for me.  I liked that in Vanilla and BC you could actually be significantly better than another random player with the same class and gear.  A good rotation meant you could, say, tank much better than someone just mashing on cooldown.
---
As someone that has become involved in the management of a small null alliance recently the biggest bugbear i have and i believe it's caused the stagnation of null is the current sov system. 
---
 Null blocks hold too much sov that they don't live simply because it's impossible to take just one system.  CCP pride themselves on it being a system the small guy can defend, but it's quite the opposite, small groups cant take even the most lowly sov because the large group will put a 100 man group on the nodes making a system impossible to capture.
---
This limits the "new blood" forming alliances and challenging the established order.
---
Change the system, change null! ihubs and tcu that self explode if the ADM isn't above 3.2 for 10 days or anything than what we have now.
---
Thanks for raising awareness. I never rate apps buy will make an exception to compensate with 5 stars.
---
the call was to get in your most expensive ship and get it blown up tho?
---
I am Spartacus!
---
Stupid thing removed boot.ini from my phone.
---
I don't know that many people in the us that get up at 6am-9am and run to the computer to turbo nerd. But.. yea.......
---
&gt;For Frig Abyssals it was like that from start, because of your 2 fleet buddies.
---
I know but this is from the solo one ie cruisers
---
And you posted on Reddit about it, why?
---
So says the bot apologist
---
Playing Komm Süsser Tod on comms while our faction fort was burning was one of the highlights of my eve career, made me love the song even more.
---
 ^(Beans will be back soon™)
---
I mean... you sound really angry that someone else posted about something that has nothing to do with you.
---
See ya in about 5 years ;)
---
Ask a Rote guy in local in Tribute. We'll accept.
---
what in the world
---
Most expensive ship that you can replace, always following Eve's golden rule of only flying what you can replace. If all you can afford to replace is a corvette or T1 frigate, then go blow it up!
---
I'm pretty sure most of can look around us (in game) and see that activity is doing the complete opposite of what they say it's doing. 
---
As the weeks go by, more and more of my alliance mates are turning into ping warriors.
---
Times I log in where there's 15-20 dudes in teamspeak shooting the shit, lucky to see 5 now. 
---
Ping for a rorqual or a super to kill and within minutes theres 50+ in teamspeak. 
---
The more they take away from peoples reasons to log in to play outside of pvp, the less people log in. The problem is compounding when people who come on to casually play, hunt, pvp, gank now log in to an empty server with nobody to talk with, they too will stop logging in.  
---
That's where Im at but I am fine with waiting for a discord ping for something juicy to kill. For some maybe its not.
---
Just report the comment as spam
---
Using a citadel is still 1000 times faster and easier than using the station and dealing with the people that camp , gank , or w/e on them. Iv run enough jfs in the past years to to know what im talking about , thanks
---
Was it that rorqual death that finally did it?  
---
Jokes aside, /rip - sorry to see you break up.
---
Okay. Didnt know that. Thanks
---
Heres challenge for you-stop cloaky camping and fight like real man.
---
I recently started putting weird buy orders 40 jumps wide, for scrap metal, in the bunch of regions.
---
 And I still havent gathered all of the "loot" omg ... 
---
Loading asset menu never felt that painful..
---
Hey that's cool if care bearing is your thing. My post is mostly a counter to the negative "eve is dying, it's the apocalypse" posts. I'm suggesting that people just go out there and leave the seriousness of the game behind. For a lot of people that'll be just flying carelessly.
---
Controversial Thought:
---
If you remove the ability to compress ore, do you create (at least some) scarcity through increasing the difficulty of moving large amounts of ore in an efficient manner
---
I wish we could sit on our gates waiting for them to lead to somewhere interesting. Shame that wh space is boring as fuck though, it could be great
---
Imagine caring about app reviews.
---
IDK how it may play out with things like server populations, but I'd love it if they ran Vanilla for a while, then started a BC server and let you move your Vanilla characters to it.  Or keep them on a vanilla server.
---
And then follow that pattern through all the expansions.  Stop where you like it best.
---
A everything CCP does, they only do it half-way because they fail to think it through.
---
Afaik they did not remove any of the map information that can be seen from everywhere if people are active in a system, so the change they did is very onsided.
---
And the cyno changes until now look like a hot mess that have not been thought through even a bit.

Hilmar account spotted.
---
It’s legit a good app so far. Skill manipulation is a pretty awesome thing.
---
Then you must not know that many eve players.
---
Or someone may have mined that moon secretly. Sorry for potato quality comparison image.
---
flatulence from the crew.
---
capsuleers do not require a crew, and so use synthetic flatulence.
---
Ok so when a ship blows up in null it goes to asset safety. Interesting.
---
Only I wasn't talking about traveling. Try to take a fight with a player who shoots you in highsec and you'll see how much of a non-issue the faction police are.
---
Are you literally salty because he adapted and is playing smart? Fuck that's some mega salt...
---
I have left a 1 star review as well. Enjoy
---
Good job, that's about all it does.
---
It lacks a lot of basic functionality you'd expect from an app. Even from a guy releasing something as a pet project, much less a big company.
---
I'm not defending bots I'm just saying that most of the bot accusations on Reddit are bs based on conjecture and in that sense a waste of everybody's time.
---
But I just lost my Loki like 2 days ago. Wasn't an exciting fight either. I perma repped their fleet until they started bumping me off the station so I just turned off the repper and let them have it. Took like an hour before I gave in. Tough little bastard but I replaced it with a thrasher cuz most people ignore it and a buddy and I went out and immediately killed a praxis
---
my device isnt supported  &gt;:U
---
also, traces cant be seen on Dscan, nor be scanned down atm
---
Imagine carrying something in your womb for 9 months for it to grow up to post shit like this
---
That thing still works? I'm impressed. I had a G4 for six months before it died on me (manufacturing defect). LG's phones are renowned for their terrible quality control.
---
Not sure which version they do and do not support, but maybe you need to look at actual numbers. https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards
---
* Zero hours doing pve since blackout.  
---
* 2 hours a week doing PI as accounts run down, with total time with ships in space around 15m a week. +15b  
---
* Responding to a few fun fleet pings and some rescue drops.  
---
* Reducing down to a handful of accounts as most run out of time (from credit card) over the next 10 days and then a few that run until November and then we'll see.
---
Well, Most will blow right past the hour sure, But I can just pause it and walk away *IF* I need to. 
---
Whereas in eve, Its going to blow past the hour no matter what, And I am fully commited with no turning back at that point
---
Same deal when I play KSP, I'll go to play a small session, But leave the stuff in progress whilst I walk away and shower, Before coming back to do more, And then walking off to cook food, Then coming back to do even more
---
Most likely stats similar to your activity tracker aggregated over time a much better metric for whether people are engaged with the game than just plain being logged in.
---
Does anyone care? The game has a cancer called imbalanced mechanics across the board. They are balanced out by flipping the seesaw in the other direction.
---
 Jita 4-4 needs immediate rework.
---
Try manually piloting your frigates my friend. Makes all the difference.
---
Of course a price reduction would result in more players. Truth is we don't have access to the data of actual causes for unsubs/reduced user count. Just because there's a reduced user logs doesn't mean that translates to reduced revenue.
---
It's very unlikely they'd lower the price because their strategy is clearly value leader and not a cost leader.
---
My G3 lasted 3 years before it died and that was with heavy use. Got a free replacement that I've had over a year now.
---
I logged in 3 times on 5 accounts over the weekend to collect free skillpoints first thing each morning, and then went to enjoy the weekend with my son. Had a great time not playing eve
---
I personally had not put as much stock into something Sort Dragon was championing, the loneliness factor. When local was broken this week, or fixed, and I was checking something- I saw like 20 people in local. I realized that I had been missing just knowing real, living people were around to chat with outside of my single mumble channel. It had felt pretty empty, the kind of empty when you play a single player console game and beat all of the content and now you are just running around at the end and all of the NPCs repeat the same dialogue over and over because the story is over.
---
Can you give us a minimum iOS/Android version please? Is there somithing like architecture (arm/arm64) limitations?
---
Lore-wise, IIRC, the cost of the crews for their lifetime wages is included in the construction of the ship. Capsuleers are all very, very space-rich compared to the wages of regular people.
---
&gt; but the only real solution I see to super blocks is removing corp/alliance standings and cap alliance size at a lowish number so you literally cannot blue people to expand.
---
Cool, So we just run 10x the amount of GSF Alliances, And then use out of game tools to blue each other up.
---
That’s a capability we have never had until now.
---
Does this app contribute to the MAU or any other player count metrics?
---
But that shouldn't excuse them for the rest of the app being completely half arsed.
---
I've always used the same few handles when I play games - they're no secret :D
---
42 people and counting would like to have a word with you...
---
I’m going to miss you.
---
&gt;The only way to fix this is to make resources region-specific
---
Good news!  We already have this.  There's moongoo you can only get in the North, and moongoo you can only get in the South.  As well as region-locked ice.
---
Problem is everyone needs all the raw materials.  So we just trade in Jita.
---
&gt;Break mega-coalitions and force them to spread out.
---
Which means they conquer more territory and there's even fewer groups in null.
---
If you want conflict, you don't want the blocs to spread out.  You want them very dense so that there is room for other people to be in null.  The more people, the more friction.
---
Oh look, an arazu sitting here all alone, FREE KILL
---
does it work w/ mailing lists and such?  the old one would let you read new mails, but you had to go to the "recent activity" tab.  you coudln't view your mailing lists by just going to the "mail" tab.
---
and what about sending mail?  That would actually be awesome.
---
Depends on when a player converts to using injectors, which is not going to be new players. Using your numbers that's a 33% reduction in 22% of their revenue. They'd immediately go from 41m to 38m, or a 7% drop in gross revenue. To make up for that, they'd have to add many more subscribing players.
---
I appreciate that there is some sort of push back against the whole r/eve is dying meme. I have fun in Eve but when I come to r/eve it's always a pool of negativity that hurts my interest in the game. I've mentioned it before but just about all of the times I remember "quitting" eve was because r/eve catastrophised the fuck out of one issue or another.
---
Soon as they add PI/Industry interactions I’m down.
---
yes if you join a null alliance you can get good fights in null every day if you want
---
just get a ratting ship that can also pvp
---
solo/small gang hunters will show up to fight you when you are at anoms
---
then it's up to you if you want to 1v1 / 1v? or call in standing  
---
remember that most people have no clue what they're talking about. most of the best advice I've gotten is from people who killed me 1v1.
---
hey thanks for showing how weak your argument is, resorting to name calling smh. You have something against people with disabilities too? What a scumbag, guess this ends our talk.
---
&gt; investing money before a TQ patch note
---
&gt; Exploration is the only randomness factor in pve.
---
No, not really. It's the same bunch of sites everywhere.
---
Now we need PI to have a usable interface that might be fun in someway to we don't have to hate it so much anymore !
---
Repacked my DED Tengu last night, haven't ran a single one since the blackout. Going to try and make more ISK through pvp, and relic/ghost sites to help make up for lack of income.
---
It wasn't even the hunters that were bitching though. It was everyone else trying to use any excuse they could to argue against the proposed cyno changes. 
---
"What about cyno vigils? We shouldn't need to train extra skills to light cynos for a vigil"
---
"Why should we have to train Cyno V to move a jump freighter?"
---
"CCP is just doing this to make us buy injectors"
---
Well, they got their wish. They don't need to train Cyno V, they can fit it on a T1 hull for vigils, and they can light it with their current skills(unless of course they were rookie ship cyno alts that only had cyno trained).
---
Be careful what you wish for.
---
Rage on  little man . THE SALT FLOW from our post is real
---
SOE "Rainbow Warrior" class Atrocity Documentation Reporting frigate, named after a legendary vessel common to the mythology of all four empire factions, and thus assumed to derive from the stories of the pre-collapse civilization of the cluster.
---
It could document whaling ops.
---
I too am against a total wipe... but the idea of a "natural" disaster does sound interesting. 
---
Maybe another pulse from the New Eden system happens, it could throw the gate network into chaos, pilots would have to learn new routes, or it cause all the current links to wh space to permanently collapse, maybe something that huge would actually cause some systems to supernova destroying ships, station, planets etc... In any sec. 
---
That should seriously impact everything in the game. CCP could randomize which systems are destroyed. Travel to the destroyed systems would require new ships and modules to get back into them, and traverse them safely. 
---
Players who do manage to get in could find treasures left over, establish new gates, build new routes etc... 
---
The skyboxes would have to be reworked with the creation of multiple new nebula, each system could have natural phenomenon that effect ships differently causing even more new specialized ships, modules, and skills to be needed and produced. 
---
Such a Kaboom would throw empire space into utter chaos, bounderies rewritten increase in CONCORD need etc... 
---
Just one mans thought.
---
Wish I'd had this a few weeks ago when I got popped in my Gila on exit in high sec

I'd imagine that's because outside of mining or incursions I don't think there is much of a social element to PvE/industry. That's what I think people are really looking for.

Out of game tools don't let you modify the UI and show things as blue on overview/local. Would it be possible to organize larger in some way? Probably but it would be no where near as simple or effective as it is now.
---
I mean you could remove Empire Control and Sovereignty to reduce corp cat to 601 and limit Alliance count to say 5-10 and you have an effective organization cap of 3000-6000 instead of the effectively unlimited there is now.

Would I rather ten 6000 member super powers instead of one 60000 member one? Yes.

'Demographic and industrial' There is more of case X, so there for less of case Y. i have read an anti sunscreen argument with similar points.  Just because there is more of X doesn't mean there less of Y.  I mean maybe there are just more gamers.  And as a game like Factorio has sold over 1.5 million I think its safe to say there is still a demographic for games that are a time sink.

I wouldn't call it a boycott, there is just no reason to log in right now. 
---
Even less once it becomes too painstaking for me to do free JF logistics for the benefit of the alliance.
---
I think it's just a bit boring and too snowbally in general, but yeah it is really fun when it work the way it should. A revitalised FW definitely will help the game a lot, especially with new players, but other types of space also need to be looked at.
---
Sure, I'm pretty comfortable with people who share your attitude no longer playing.

And nothing of value was lost.

I will continue to play eve online.

Boycott what? Getting rid of players that don’t want to actually play? Why would we want to do that?

why do i suspect that enough people  stopped playing the CCP have had to change the policy and offer skill points to get people logging into the game lol . Well reap what you sow

They also have functionally infinite ore. You can only dead rat a few hours a month before running out of sites. Running outside of your home hole massively increases risk.
---
The biggest challenge I've found with streaming the game is that it is very difficult to hide your exact location so you can't really do anything sneaky. If CCP added some kind of streamer view that could hide location information and even names that would be helpful.
---
why? are you trying to accomplish something?
---
Reminds me of Enron and Worldcom changing their reporting styles every 2-4 years before they got found out for fraud.

I wonder if people will still be parroting this once the only things flying in null are other nano gangs and blops groups.

I've also seen people ratting in PVP fit VNIs/Gilas/Myrms. Which isn't impossible, it's just a horrendous source of isk. Might as well be venture mining in high sec belts.
---
Yes! I totally agree with that. But CCP has put themselves in a tough spot here. If you got 3 characters that can all log in at the same time for 15, that's a huge price reduction from having three accounts with the same permissions for 45. 
---
Obviously, to address the dumbness of three restricted characters on one account they added the multiple character training thing but that's 20 AND doesn't can't log in! Comparing the $20 MCT to a year omega sub at $11/month, the MCT is egregious! They absolutely should fix this as it's a clear they want multiple accounts over characters.
---
IMO, CCP should drop this stupid incentive for multiple accounts altogether and incentive more character slots on the same account that can log in with other characters logged in only IF the character is omega, not the account. 
---
Then they could do discounts for a second, third, fourth character slot. That would be WAY simpler.
---
That EVE needs incredible evolution to keep pace, or can continue its gentle decline, is unfortunately something CCP appears to have realized years ago.  Hilmar, and the rest of the execs, took option B: keep EVE in "maintenance mode" throwing off cash, and invest that cash in other games - each of which failed miserably.  All of that money - much of which could have gone into modernizing EVE - has been lit on fire, and EVE may no longer be big enough to be worth the significant investment it now needs since you need to catch up on years worth of work that should have been done.  And many of the devs who wanted to do that work and could have done it were basically shown the door through CCP's complete indifference to investing in them and their game, and are now elsewhere.  CCP has some good devs left, but not nearly the number they need to revitalize the game.

Google says: An opinion or conclusion formed based on incomplete information.

The incomplete part mainly comes from the fact that EVE is a game running in one second increments so it's very difficult to tell a person apart from a bot based on observing them alone.

Ah, right.

why deal with so much more risk for so much less in null?  Just my thoughts, anyways
---
&gt;I mean
---
They almost need to come up with a way to hand out loyalty points for all PVP activities--even if you die doing it. I am at work, and don't have the time to make this a real, fleshed out idea; however, in principle I agree with you. A reason needs to be given for people to want to take (and seek) fights, even ones that it looks like they might lose.

Only for when you're already doing stuff which involves large quantities of ISK. Until then, go with attribute enhancement implants (to train skills faster, leave this clone docked most of the time) and implants that boost your fitting space if necessary. Don't worry about a Slave set or a Crystal set or something for a while.
---
&gt;My main goal is to have a long range sniper ship
---
You're in luck. Lots of the most popular stuff is based on this. In big Null fleets, Eagle, Muninn, and Ferox are this. In Providence, Cerberus fills the same purpose. For smaller stuff, Jackdaw, Retribution, and (beam) Confessor are probably the top ships for this sort of thing.

Somehow, it still hasn’t been topped..

---
&gt; Again, there is nothing stopping the members of those blocs from pushing for their leadership to do something like what you are suggesting.
---
Well, kind of but you are forgetting that EVEs older players are bowing out overall, and no one is replacing them is the real problem. EVE needs new leaders with the time to actually do it. Older groups are just imploding or being absorbed into the blocs when leadership fails, making the consolidation issue worse.
---
&gt;We as players of Eve have the freedom to do almost anything, we can establish and run our own markets, we can set up wars and seriously change the political landscape and we can completely wreck the economy if we so chose. CCP has given us the freedom to do all of those things, but for some reason peoplechose to sit out deep in null doing the same thing over and over again, while complaining about Eve being stagnant.
---
​
---
&gt;That's what weirds me out the most, to be honest. A significant portion of the "Eve is dying"-crowd are members of the large blocs they blame for the stagnation.
---
&gt;Seriously, you want to see change in Eve? Start leaving the blocs, you are free to do this. But no, people keep whining on here and on the forums for CCP to fix the issue, but they have the power themselves.
---
I feel you are completely ignoring how CCPs actions have created this stagnancy in null. The players are not the problem, laughably and long broken gameplay mechanics are. Lowsec's descent into irrelevance. Blocs have had infinite resources and no real challenges for far too long, SoV warfare is boring, grinding citadels is boring, there is no reason to fight for anything anymore really. With no conflict drivers things just become a static wasteland of krabs. They choose stagnancy because doing anything else doesn't feel worth it, and that is the real problem. 
---
Just saying "well people can choose to do something else if they wanted to" isn't good enough, there are some core issues that are causing this stagnancy that need corrected, mainly from compounding problems CCP created and never bothered to fix or balance before adding the next broken thing without thinking about the bigger picture and economy of the game.
---
You seem content to do nothing about any of it and let things continue until EVE is just a handful of blues
---
Go to war with high sec, its helping the Imperium retain members immensely
---
Will do that! Thanks!
---
My wife and I both had that phone and they both died in about the same time. Never buying LG again.
---
nope. i get -2 in 1 fleet. i never shoot pods cuz that would fuck my sec stat even much more. even if i go solo...shit goes negative pretty fast, as i already explained...if u have to chose to ONLY engage suspects and criminals..then the content in lowsec is abysmal....
---
and the next comment about " simply buy tags..hurrdurr..." will make me explode.
---
i only have ONE fucking omega toon. i am not one of those nerds with multiple accounts raking in the iskies and lol about poor people....
---
so 2 hours of LS fleet, causes me to run clone soldiers for a couple of hours afterwards, or waste a lot of isk on tags.
---
since i despite any form of pve in eve..im spacepoor, and i dont want tto be forced to do dull shit just to pay that sec loss bullshit.
---
a lot of "smart" people in this comment section, most of them prolly does pvp once per month and dont see where the issue is.
---
makes me gringe , when i get " smart" awnsers from plebs like this -.-
---
Wife aggro is the most dangerous aggro from Day 1 of EVE
---
Are any of the OG RK folks even still playing?
---
Exploration is definetly one of my preferred gamestyles, especially in Elite. Will try out everything though :)
---
F o7
---
Nah, Seitu Mipo or sth
---
So fucking real...
---
I have no problems with either of these, will check it out! Thanks!
---
Yeah I know that but if someone is the hole and I am out of dscan range of the hole I potentially will not see them scan it and jump into it. Which would mean I would have less control over the statics.
---
Exactly.  Mix up the rat types, spawn areas, if they scram/disrupt/web or not and the variation of ships spawned using RNG, or even how many groups spawn and interest I think would increase in PVE.
---
With taht much mining he could apply to goons
---
This made me think of a great April Fools event; where Triglavian armada shows up and destroys Jita 4-4 Station. Causing mass chaos. Then at downtime they rollback the game to before the event.
---
&gt; Getting rid of players that don’t want to actually play 
---
... the way you and the other pvp-nerds think it should be played
---
That's what you forgot in your reply, FTFY
---
HA KNEW IT
---
pretty sure this is the lowest graphic preset.
---
Serious question, as I'm not familiar with bots but I believe I've been seeing one in my own system recently. If you are blue to the capsule at the gate does the ratting/mining ship warp out? Or does it go on with whatever it does?
---
If they really want chaos then I think this would bring A LOT of it...
---
It would make regional markets great again as well, and make WH much more important for logistics.
---
But if we do this, reduce the jump ranges of capitals significantly.
---
u read my comments? u realize i only have ONE omega, i simply cannot afford to plex multiple accounts with real money. so yeah fucxk you and ur " smartass" awnsers.
---
people like u want to make me punch faces. feel free to pay me an omega sub for a second account if u shit money in real life. thx.
---
Missions are just some of the possible drudgery you do so you can actually play the game. Nobody even *wants* to do them. ;)
---
He can feel free to use his hands while he still has them. I'm sure that some people in TMB are eager to change that.
---
If you don't want to hurt the players, don't strip the modules from their J-Space citadels just because you're whining about how unappreciated you feel.
---
Guess what. I, and probably a lot of other people, have more an attachment to my home citadel (and a few previous home citadels where I have some stuff) than any ship that I've ever owned.
---
💀 the beans are dead 💀
---
Wilco, will read on about this!
---
I read that Naga is a good ship aswell.
---
What's your snapchat bby? I'll add you to the snap group uwu
---
Skill injectors are a thing. Go buy some plex, sell it, and you can be a veteran in a matter of clicks.
---
What's the best way to get into industry? I bought &amp; researched some BPOs that I chose by looking at IPH, only to realize that IPH had totally screwed up market prices, and nothing I've done has totally fixed it.
---
Also, what are some of the groups running invasions, and is it worth it over incursions? I'd be willing to sacrifice ISK/hr for something a little less mind-numbing.
---
Oh yeah, I remember doing that.  Never do that.
---
yess so the krabbing alliances can destroy the pvpers who wont have iskies for pvp shippies.  
---
whats  wrong with being an old woman you sexist cuck
---
Omega-only though
---
so ya'll gas this wall of text up but can't give me one ragevote? SMH TL;DR
---
Lulz, “Pvp-Nerds”. You’re playing a PvP game. Somewhere null became so easy that players forgot that.
---
u agree to pvp on undock. thats the first eve mantra. so if people feel they have to shortcut through dangerous lowsec, just because they too lazy to move the longer secure route, they should expect to get rekt. 
---
thats how eve works, u know?
---
and my whole point is, i DONT WANT TO DO SHIT PVE to grind my sec status back. i log in, undock, and go shoot players. thats eve for me. and for a lot of other people..hence eve is a sandbox PVP orientated game.
---
pvp is crucial to eves economy. no ship losses, no work for industrials, no industrials, no money for miners..and so on...
---
also NULL and WHs are DEAD man. u would know that if u would be a PVP dude like me, and not a casual " once per week pvp roam" guy.
---
thx.
---
TBH if I wanted that I'd probably be playing something else entirely.
---
yes, this ccplz
---
Yep. 1DQ local is *always* on. I figured that this is most likely due to the number of people parked in it being so high, because the rational part of my mind says there is no way CCP has their shit together enough to turn on local *just* for staging systems.
---
No and they are barely managing to do anything atm really.
---
[Uranus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Uranus2.jpg)
---
Some gas giants just look kind of boring.
---
This kind of change with a resource depletion and pirate factions "retreating to bordering low-sec to rebuilds" would make this viable. 
---
But depletion I mean regions doesn't go fully depleted, they just gradually degrade so a 30k man alliance depletes it fast, but a 5k man or less alliances in a region actually is small enough for the region to "re-energize" so it becomes more of a target over time for bigger groups.
---
Well the idea is that the 4 most valuable regions are clustered in the center (or even overlapped on each other, but not directly connected to each other through gates. Such that there are "overlap" areas where you can hot-drop each other's farming regions from staging without your staging systems being in range of each other. Not having direct gate connections (and adding Fatigue to Ansiblex) will make it harder for one blob to own all 4 prime regions at once.
---
Except it's not. You are completely ignoring the fact that many of the US people that would normally be at work at that time were not because it was a holiday. The number you quoted was at 3pm EST, which is when many US people would normally be at work, but that wouldn't be the case on this particular day.
---
That's why picking that particular monday to base your entire analysis off of is either disingenuous at best, or stupid at worst.
---
Good guys win again.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I think CCP was smart to add some difficult content like abyssal space and abyssal PVP that you can log in and do for a 20-40 minute play session but even that gets old pretty quick. 
---
I agree, but even with quicker access to fast casual content, they really need to address the timers for getting ready to leave. There are so many session timers associated with switching around your ship and pod, it's really frustrating.
---
It is. Attack battlecruisers aren't really as suitable for general-purpose ships, but if you find a situation where you are using one, it's worth its weight in gold.
---
Get fucked
---
Like the fleet finder?
---
arghhh ur like the 20th dude who obviosuly has ZERO clue what hes talking about.."simply go 0 or wh " u realize  NULL IS DEAD esp in us/autz, same with wormholes...so i take any pvp content i can find..and it often ends up in lowsec.
---
and i really dont like to repeate myself over and over, but it seems i have to, because a lot of people commenting on this, seem not to be able to see things from a different view except their own...
---
i DONT have multiple accounts, i have ONE omega toon. and i hate eves PVE and pretty much most forms of isk making ingame, they are dull, repetitive and dumb.
---
i purely live of pvp loot, i pay my plex and ships with it, and thats a pretty hard living.
---
and on top of that i have to grind clone soldiers, or do shit pve to get isk for those tags....
---
thats just fucking retarded.
---
i have the feeling most commentators here are krablords with multiple omega accounts raking in the iksies for them, and barely do pvp at all....
---
CCPlease: Fitting tool!
---
Just downloaded the app.
---
I use the fitting tool ALL THE TIME on Eve Droid on my phone (a third party app).  PLZ if you want to expand on this, make a fitting tool!  Include DPS charts like PYFA just added and EFT used to have.
---
Thank you to the awesome team that put this together!
---
Zero. Zero. Divide-by-zero error.
---
Will have to undock my rorqs next month, or later depending on skill injector prices and what stupid ships i feed to frat. Did the max crab thing months ago and have been living of that and skill farming.
---
You get 3 characters/account. Training a hauler doesn't take much time.
---
With a triple monitor setup and 2 alts.
---
Who're you?
---
Yes a few.
---
Are you the guy who left the 1-star app review? You seem like a real nice guy.
---
The graph in this image is for 1 month. We have been discussing the 3 month. Check out that image or go look for yourself.
---
I think unsub and play other games is a better challenge as wasting isk.
---
It will be a great day when the game does finally die off.
---
Agreed! I resubbed to the game as a returning player from 2006 on a new account and the skill events made getting into my ship of choice way less painful (and even allowed me to dabble in a few different areas). Although some of the level 5 training times are a bit foreboding down the line - it is nice to know that I can enjoy different careers and at a so-so level with a bunch of skills @ 4.
---
Maybe, there is a third option.  You're just wrong about all this.
---
Thing is though if someone is smart enough they can always make another bot. Which is why I suggest bring the time a bot can farm and the time a player can farm more in line with each other so their effect is reduced.
---
i do NOT camp ls gates . 
---
u sound mad salty.
---
i roam ...also makes no sense to me to solo engage non blinkies on gates and shit, because gateguns.
---
i dont have multiple omega accounts....to logi myself, resebo myself or torake in the afk iskies to pay tags and shit....
---
im talking about the general lowsec pvp punishments, u find tons of non suspects in plexes and shit...so u loss sec status when engaging them.
---
wheres the logic on that?
---
at least give a suspect timer on entering plexes.
---
the complete LS mechanic is out of date and should have a heavy rework tbh.
---
if u dont understand that..then i cant help u.
---
The lower you are, the less the hit hurts (percentage of the difference to -10). I spent literally years between -3 and -1 without too much effort. But yeah that was leaving in LS, so running plexes etc which helped a lot.
---
I'm sorry, it's my fault. I assumed you could read.
---
If you actually look at those graphs, they show they date of the day in question. I shrank the graph scope because it was easier to select a particular time of day that way. It's the same data, just zoomed in.
---
Not that I've seen. We've been fighting them in vale. While they've provided good content for people to learn, the quality is nowhere near what it used to be, and they rely heavily on a large group of blues + superior numbers to win any fights.
---
you sir, clearly dont understand what this post is all about at all...
---
highsec gankers have nothing to do with ls punishmnet, they will keep ganking you no matter what, since its mostly TOONS of people and they only used to facemelt yozr freighter in niarja.
---
go by a brain. rethink your post.
---
and then try again mate.
---
Why? I dislike the indy cyno too, but you provide no reasoning as to why they should remove it? What are your concerns?
---
Wish I knew his username now..
---
why
---
Same. Logging in to reset extractors on planets is a pain
---
Do you really need an explanation on free vs paid and **why** this distinction matters?
---
2 epithal due pi multiboxing; 10m total  
---
6hrs per week for pi farm; 0hrs per week for pve (DED, relics)  
---
60,0000:1
---
But to add my alliance group slowed to a halt thanks to blackout despite the initial spike of vets returning
---
I'm wrong that it's highly unlikely a pve ship didnt die to a gank?  
---
Maybe.  Maybe hes the one true krabbign god who has surpassed all of eve's metas and statistics, the one who can defy logic and abilities and balance itself to krab in peace forever invincible.
---
I just... doubt it.
---
sorry but it was probably deleted for a reason
---
There's a downward slope but your specific line could only have been drawn by an imbecile, sorry.
---
true. theres plenty of problems with lowsec.
---
also theres plenty of problems with eves playerbase and  general understanding of pvp, looking at some comments i get here..makes me want to punch peoples faces
---
any krablord/highsec sperglord comment on my post, is kinda invalid to me. 
---
u agree to pvp on undock..no matter which region of eve.
---
people tend to forget that and be like " reeeeee, u filthy pirate...."
---
I will edit my post :)
---
No AAR, mods please delete so I can get karma
---
Hey man, he wrote 14 paragraphs and used big words, it is obviously a sMaRt IdEa

Fuck you CCP. Waited years for a this, only to have them cut support my phone version. I bet it's a cool app but I sure as fuck can't install it or use it. Excuse me for not having a thousand dollars to waste on a new piece of plastic. My phone was expensive and only 3 and a half year old LG, and they've cut me from support. Got the latest OS updates so that can't be it.
---
In what world does a 3 year old computer or phone get it's app or program support dropped?
---
I'm so pissed at this. Late bought LG G Vista 2 here, same boat
---
Oh am not an Alpha, I am Omega. 
---
Just if I was gonna spend even more cash I'd rather actually buy other games.
---
https://i.imgur.com/rhkzZXo.jpg
---
as long as it’s only used by jump freighters I see no issue
---
well u still have those plex mechanics, people like to forget that.
---
same with gategun/station gun shenannigans.
---
so nope it wouldnt be just nullsec without bombs and bubbles.
---
also booshers have to set themself to criminal to be able to boosh in lowsec,is kinda retarded too....
---
I was great with the changes until they affected me

What you said:

Snuff racist to china in local whole fight big dishonorable ...
---
Only flew with you guys for a month but sad to see you go. Fly safe and GL to the rest of the guys
---
&gt; why deal with so much more risk for so much less in null?
---
How can you accurately judge the risk without attempting to continue as you were?
---
&gt;You’re playing a PvP game

found your fault: sandbox =/= PVP game

avdot, the coolest chinese corp with sexiest FC alive, sayler, joined us a few days ago and averse guys are being kept on a leash so you can shove your racism accusations up drone wangs ass
---
ok, then pls explain? people give 0 fuck when they can get their hands on an escelation/ded runner in lowsec, they will murderface him for his shinies.
---
and the last thing u want to care about is your sec stat when u can get nice loot/kill.
---
so explain pls how sec stat would prevent u from getting rekt in lowsec?
---
and dont tell me " i watch locla for blinkies". cuz if that is your only defense..then ur an idiot.
---
I’ve already lost tons of ships, I don’t need to do it again to see the meaning of it.

Yea that was my point. These being entirely free is a bery important factor in this discussion yet the guy I was replying to totally missed that.

---
I can't believe you've just lumped all of China into one race.  It sounds like you are the real racist here.
---
What if they get pointed and stops trying to warp? Do they have to initiate warp again and wait 3 minutes again?
---
"I wasn't actually retarded! I wAs JuSt JoKiNg!"
---
I'm just going to let that speak for itself. You've made my argument for me.
---
Updated my post. Sorry completely forgot to include reasoning. Duhhh
---
&gt; You're measuring from a weekend to a weekday.
---
Even beside that, he's measuring from a weekend to today's datapoint.
---
PCU is around 1900-1930 ever day, so his endpoint is still climbing.
---
Data analysis is hard with stage 4 terminal spodbrain, I guess.
---
Game where PvP is fully enabled without the ability to disable = PvP game. Thinking that Eve is in any way shape or form not a PvP game at it’s core is delusional.
---
No, the way people get into fights is by being in the same space at the same time.
---
The way people stay organized while out roaming is by being in a fleet. Which means having a leader, a fleet commander if you will, who gathers everyone together and keeps them organized. You can't just keep a fleet open without direction forever. That's not what they're for.
---
If you want an automatic association between you and your friends, make a Corp. If you want to leech ISK and LP off each other while you run missions, form a fleet each time you're all online.
---
Sad to hear but all the best with RL MASSA.  Enjoyed my time in the corp harassing Goons, long live the Corm fleets of Doom!
---
are u retarded?
---
yout totally dont get what this post is about, and i honestly dont have the nerve to explain eve to you. as i had to awnser plenty of seriously stupid comments already.
---
u probably do pvp once per month.
---
i make a living of pvp. i do NOT run any pve/mining or whatver krabshit ..i also dont have mulitple omegas raking in the afk/passive iskies for me. to pay for tags.
---
boy, theres so much more to it. but again...i dont want to explain eve to you...
---
Literally me
---
You do realize you have a track record of posts claiming to be the authority on retardation... what does that say about you? Hrmmm...
---
The premise of your argument is that EVE is dying and will die soon.        
---
I do not accept your premise, on the grounds that people have been saying the exact same thing for a decade and a half, and we're all still here.
---
I'm gonna miss you too O2jayjay ;)
---
As long as i can mine while at work to kill time, i'm happy.  Now let Americans into the alpha damn it
---
All they had to do was tie SBU resistances/HP to sov index. That would get the result of "making" people live in the space they want but also provide ability to actually use capitals in a meaniful way for sov fights.
---
you probably run pvp once per month.
---
2hours of smallgang in lowsec, ( not even shooting pods) and u be -2 easily.
---
dont forget the 5 dollar for 1mil SP starter pack :)
---
I'm also space poor mate, so here are some possible solutions for you that will probably give you better results than complaining on this subreddit:
---
1) While you roam in LS, go for belts and hunt Clone Transports to get the tags yourself (the lower the system's sec status more expensive the tags), while at the same time boosting your sec status a little by killing rats. Bonus points if you manage to kill Mordu's Legion NPCs for their shipline BPCs.
---
2) Your account is Omega, not your toon; use one of the extra characters to train a hauler to get things from HS. T1 haulers will do, but if you get to Transport ships a DST full of ships will last you for ages in LS.
---
Hope this helps, have fun o7
---
It's not like the new changes made a difference in regards to that. Eve's UI was always stupid inaccessible to new players.
---
Only Jump Freighters can jump to Indy Cyno's. If the payoff for your bait Indy is to drop a 10 bil ship on field with no offensive modules I'm OK with that.
---
Can you not?
---
If people gave a shit about your cause, they’d come to you.
---
&gt;You do realize you have a track record of posts claiming to be the authority on retardation
---
That's just blatantly not true.
---
It was just what I recall from a long time begore, my sec status has been around -10 for at least a couple of years.
---
I.. i can buy ship skins remotely? Dear lord.. there goes my wallet.
---
With that amount of protection, I wouldn't move either tbh
---
meh... Is it Christmas already? Paint the walls with ~~holly~~ text
---
Joined NC, bored to death? Connection?
---
He has multiple farms set up.
---
The other day we watched him mine out a Medium belt, dropped carriers on his Freighter full of the ore he'd mined, his hel bugged out and started aligning into space, his rorq started approaching into the athanor it was on.
---
Meanwhile, with carriers cloaked in a safe I noticed his barges were all now mining in the small.
---
Warped a dictor over and then a carrier just above and started killing his bargers with a carrier while his rorq continued to align to nothing inside of a athanor.

---
Why would you leave it crit want to die to a kiki fleet or someone who keeps you bubbled long enough to get a way in?
---
Of course I'll be sarcastic because it's rng if you die assuming anyone in the game is rage rolling.
---
Only jfs can jump to those cynos so I really don't see any issues with that. For everything else, u gonna need a force recon or a black ops battleship to light a cyno for caps/supers or regular fleets.
---
New plan to kill corps. Have them join NC.

It would be cool if it did tho

Worthy adversary, GL

I came to EVE because of the player created 'lore'. Because of the big wars. I'm not a content creator by my nature and I don't tend to get very invested in games. So I choose to join Horde after starting the game 1 year ago. To ride along and witness how the stories unfold from the inside. But I guess I came too late to get what I want. It's all stagnant now, there doesn't seem to be any meaningful conflict.  
---
Horde moved, and I missed it (because I was not actively playing - cause why bother if nothing actually changing?). Now I don't really find the motivation to log in and recover my stuff from asset safety.  
---
I think the game needs more resource scarcity. The big power blocks need an incentive to fight. Not for content, for the lifeblood of their super umbrellas: for ore.
---
Reminder this is the (in)famous Theran

I still remember my first Solo Kill with a big smile.

---
They have to git gud.... Realistically though by small I mean relatively small compared to what exists now. I expect there would still be plenty of empires, just less hyper condensed mega entity's
---
CCP always stated they wanted to revamp corp/alliance management.  They never really did (ACL lists, Security, rights, Roles, etc etc).  Leadership always gets burned out because running a group is real work compared to other game communities.
---
Players that are plugged into great leadership teams that can be Eve Focused for 10 hours a day (minimum) usually thrive.  If that doesn't happen, the group doesn't happen (to a certain membership count)
---
You get micro groups like us (S&amp;T) which are basically just retirement homes...but do not alter or change the game in any drastic way.
---
I want the completely helpless ships that I shoot to be very expensive, not throwaways.
---
I mean technically if you run your modules to the point of complete cap drain your ship can blow up....just not in a self destruct manner.

I have pvp'd for 2 hours every  day since the Black Out started.

I’m finding that running even a small corp can be quite the task, I’ve been playing for almost 10 years and it appears I still don’t know shit about this game it would seem 😂

Hahahaha, this post is irony gold.

You talk about people accepting the 'rules' of the game and then complain about the rules.

The fact you don't want to live with the consequences of your actions speaks volumes, dude.

Indy Cyno can only be targeted by Jump Freighters. Capital battles won't be using them. To bring in your Carriers or your Titans or whatever, you'll still need a Force Recon or Black Ops.

I miss working with newbies, I remember isk doubling one in my Corp after he was sad about something.
---
Asking the real questions
---
What if your goal is to die?
---
I get that, and it's not really your, or the hunters fault. 
---
The doctrines that these groups have on hand, are generally limited. Smaller groups that will try to fight back are the exceptions, rather than the rule. So why would they have doctrines based on the exception that they're going to get to use once or twice a month? 
---
To hit the bigger targets they need to be agile and high damage. That generally mean sacrificing tank, which means they cant take a stand up fight in them. 
---
In other words, the lazy fucks that drop dozens of super caps ste hurting you as much as the hunters.
---
&gt; Not worth it unless Augmented or Harvester.
---
You're forgetting about doing it just for the salt.
---
&gt;the Indy Cyno to the update and made the whole thing completely pointless

Are you actually this stupid? Or are you bitching over something that no one else gives a shit about?

all these smartyass dumb awnsers in this threat...and you expect me to stay calm and all nice and friendly ? XD
---
its pretty obvious where the problem is, and still i have to explain it a dozen times.... 
---
o/
---
interestingly leaving the game and this sub would have more of an impact.
---
Yes it does
---
I have continued.  I am making the best of the changes i disapprove of.
---
That’s how
---
Nightmares have always been my favorite fleet comp.
---
TBH titans are overrated. They’re cool looking and powerful sure but the massive titan battles that make the news are tidi cancer fests, difficult to move/sell if you want to ever leave your alliance, and for most people a massive investment you might not get to use more than every so often. I’d much rather have my sub for the next year and 40b of subcap to throw around than a titan
---
@ZateoX ...... yes even with casual amounts of play time.  EvE is well worth it
---
TAPI puts when?
---
Down vote for your downvote
---
As a leader of Micron Technology I'm sorry to say we are not recruiting. But if you find us and fight us...tendies will be had.
---
i lost 0 ships, but i’ve bombed stuff with a few SB alts. 
---
It’s not hard,
---
Only about an hour a day tops
---
Hey could’ve been 2 1bil tengus to the same DED site. I still cringe in shame
---
I fixed some of the formatting. If you feel that way why are you on this sub though? Especially in this social climate...
---
Meanwhile I'm luring those less than one day newbies to use my promotion link for the 'free' 1 million skillpoints and telling them that 15 euro start bundle is value of their lives.
---
You're partly right. You're also wildly wrong because your premise that nullsec is the cause is hilariously backwards. Nullsec are the only groups successfully retaining new players.
---
This biggest problem Eve has that makes it a niche game is that when you join the game, you finish the tutorials, you get dropped into the Eve Universe. Now what?
---
Every other MMO tells you what to do next and draws you an arrow to it. As a new player in Eve finding something interesting to do is difficult, and finding actual direction is even harder. The all too common story for new people in Eve is to finish the introduction to the game, sit there and wonder what to do next, then log out forever. Even those who do find initial direction quickly run into a SP wall where their options are either skill injectors, or months of skill training before being able to do anything both useful and fun.
---
This is why new players who join the large nullsec groups stay and why new players who join the smaller groups tend to wander off. When you join the nullsec groups they have programs and teams of people to help newbies get started, to help them set goals and gain some direction on what they should do next. Few of the smaller groups are capable of this.
---
One of the biggest issues that new players with the game is that new players FEEL like they can not affect a change to the landscape of EVE. They join realize the ship they want to try out is 30 days away and quite. Seriously who wants to wait 30 days to fly ship they find interesting (wo injecting yourself with money you don't even know you want to waste on some ammo). Who wants to play a game where all the vets are flying huge ships which take literal months/years of training and catch up? Who wants to play a game where moving stuff from A-&gt;B is a huge pain in the ass?
---
EVE has been dying since 2003
---
Wow this is pure cancer.
---
not really, what would make more of an impact - just leaving, or taking someone else with you? i'd stick with number 2...
---
I assume you mean sleepers, if you really took a vexor up against a drifter post the loss mail and I'll replace it. 😂
---
&gt; I have continued.
---
Um, no you aren't. Sure you continued playing but you ceased these activities. While it's interesting to see the snide comments from people who take their balls and go home, I'm more interested in knowing if the people who have continued are experiencing a huge uptick in ship losses.
---
I'm not against this in theory... but there's a lot of other thing such as fundamental game issues which should be addressed first imo.
---
and how would they do that? does everyone on the internet magically know everything that gets posted? I'm fully aware that the petition will not make any difference even if the entire population of eve signs it, and yet people like yo specifically make me wish it did make a difference...
---
dont have alt on that account.
---
also t1 hauler passing traderoutes to hubs like jita..is suicidal and asks for a gank
---
so that is no viable option.
---
i could train an alt into a viator or such. but that would take a while.
---
probably i just forgot that first rule of eve is : create multiple  omega accounts, or at least skill inject an alt on 1 omega account to be able to fly cloaky haulers.
---
sad the NPE  doesnt teach u that ,right away ..nor did the tutorial 9 years ago....
---
\-.-
---
I can say the same to you, bud.
---
Reeee?
---
wow this is an original comment!
---
Tbh I saw first rage line and missed all the rest..
---
:) well then i just reminded you how fast u lose the first couple of points of your sec stat, u get -2 and less, pretty fast...guess it takes a while to surpass -7 and downwards...
---
Its hands down my favorite sub cap ship in the game
---
&gt; why on earth someone would prefer vanilla to BC or maybe WotLK
---
Because they can start with classic and work up to those.  And sell them.
---
I appreciate your post. Do you have a corp and are interested in alliance/recruiting?
---
oh yea, sleepers, sorry my mistake, funny thing i didnt even managed to get to the gas site even because i was bussy scanning down gas site i previusly mined with venture but forgot to bookmark and i didnt check the dscan
---
Doubt it. I'd be gone in 15 seconds. Don't underestimate me. Goes both ways pal.
---
Returned to the game at the start of the month, and I haven't PVEed much since. Busy IRL with moving back to college and other responsibilities. Been busy in game moving shit around or on stratops.
---
But in the ~6 hours that I have ratted, I have lost one Myrm (90 mil counting my MTUs) to make about 250 mil. In the 2 or 3 hours that I mined for ADMs, I lost no procurers, mined about 40 mil, and I got a Cruor killmail chasing an assfrig gang out. I don't know the amount mined (donated to Porpoise pilot), but in trying to bait bads (dinobrains) into cloaky loki gang of our own, I got on 2 more frig killmails in my proc.
---
My isk to risk ratio is about 300m income:90m lost, or a profit margin of 330%. 
---
This seems acceptable to me, I dont see the extreme risk that others are claiming either. I will admit that where I live is forever away from highsec/npc null, but we are not under the wider umbrella of our coalition. And we have nightly cloakies and assfrig gangs, and occasionally blops hunters roaming around. We're not provi,  but we get baddies roaming around often enough.
---
Technically if you don't use any capacitor at all your ship can blow up. Just not in a self destruct manner.
---
Sweet non-statement
---
WE HAD GIRLS IN CORP??? WHEN?
---
But frat is blue to RR? what the fuck is their blue list up north.
---
Oh look, another post saying "Hey I can't find any pvp content, make it easier for me" 
---
&gt;Things which, in excess, are toxic in pvp videogames: Invisibility, invulnerability
---
I wonder if there's anything that's just like this in eve? 
---
You want content? Put things out in the game that encourage players to undock and go do things. Not mindlessly grind, or roam, or camp, or whatever. Make it npc based, or pve based, just make it something that pushes players together.
---
OK, I'll go ahead and gate a T1 BS from Jita 4-4 to the D-P Keepstar once a week. 
---
Rules: T1 BS Hull | No use of OP TAPI jump bridge network | no docking, but can tether. 
---
Should I do a Typhoon or an Armageddon?
---
New player missions that provide SP rewards for learning about mechanics of the game when?
---
this guy is spamming at this point.
---
There are no sleepers outside the sites though so I'm not really sure what happened here...
---
but seriously, MASAD was a great corp with a great group of people. Everyone has different play styles and dronelands is def not for everyone. We had no idea how to become space rich but we had tons of fun shooting peeps. Seriously gonna miss flying with yall.
---
I'm not saying they removed botting completely, but they certainly hampered it. And while many of them may have moved to Low and High sec, I'd imagine many of them have stopped playing/unsubbed as it's become significantly harder to Plex your account.
---
Now one change I think needs to be made by CCP immediately are changes to Athenors in HS. The fact you can mine Null sec class rocks in Highsec is pretty bullshit.
---
Stuff like this is exactly why I tell people how important all these skill events are. Even with their problems it is a net positive for the long term health of the game
---
They hate Mangos apparently? All I know is Frat came through WH killed Mangos and fucked off.
---
Change the url to "removeddit" and rest normal to see deleted comments but don't tell anyone I told you this
---
oh boy, another 200iq comment.
---
it is  some dumb RULE im complainign about, as this rule of sec loss is useless .
---
and agreeing on pvp when u undock is what makes eve, eve.
---
and at eves current state, pvp players tend to find more content in lowsec then in empty 0sec, or dead wh space.
---
discussing this with people like you is kinda like trying to explain cold fusion to a cow.
---
im pretty sure u never ever complained about some dumb mechanic in eve. cuz ccp is perfect, and eve is the epitome of flawless games.....
---
man u make me sick.
---
wait what?????? Didnt WoW classic just launch and has fucking 2 day ques to log in? You really think ppl don't want grindy games that take time? The problem in EvE is that there is no reward currently for grinding. Why invest the time when you want to build a corp of friends to go out in null and make a name for yourself and then realize you have to bend over to the doughnut. CCP will break most of the doughnut i believe. look how empty most of null is now under the Test/Goons/NC./Frat lands. I go hunt out there and it is a few bots with pods on gates, otherwise ghostlands.
---
When new bros have a reason to grind this game other than "You can be a f1 monkey in a giant alliance" you will see it breath new life. 
---
EvE is a open book that we all right in, to make a story we are all a part of. Except the story has been narrated by the same 10 ppl, more or less, for 10+ years. People are not going to be excited to write in mittens pages or graths. They want their own page and thats what the game has lost.
---
Lol I wouldn't fly shit in that system cus I know what waits on the gate out or on the gate one system over.
---
What's your proposed fix for jump freighters?
---
Will CCP not speak on this issue?
---
You know less then nothing.
---
Maybe but it's still 10x slower than now and you come across a camp well forget it.
---
But I still.dont get the thinking behind using a indy to light a cyno. I'm confused why this was even thought about. Can some explain
---
Which specific race in China?
---
implying this game have 5 years left
---
15 seconds is 11 seconds too long bud. People literally keep toons tethered on stations prepared to short scan a certain perimeter then they tell the guy with the scanners where to focus. You can literally die if you take longer than 4 seconds depending who and what is operating in the system
---
I was def throwing shade at cloaking and panic but didn't want to over-stuff my post with stereotypical QQ.
---
I go out and find PVP but it feels like a toxic waste of time lately. The game mechanics give us nothing of value to fight over. 
---
More dynamic PVE is a step in the right direction I guess. CCP seems to be playing with the idea.
---
Heard that when I first created my account in 2007. This game has many years left.
---
Whoah! We flew together a few years ago!
---
Make your own post and see how it does then.
---
If the entire population signed, it would make a diff btw. No way you’re getting even 1% tho.
---
Indeed! I’ve been around in eve :)
---
True point
---
I don’t use subcaps to pve.
---
I just look at the newer players who can’t afford to upgrade and their average death rates out where i live.
---
The average “i’m tackled” to “nevermind im dead” is less than 15 seconds.  Isn’t worth me to “show how big my balls are” by blindly feeding people who i literally cannot catch otherwise.
---
If you want to experience it, skill into a myrm or something and rat for 3-4 hours a night.  Report back here and see if you can refute what i’ve seen second hand... because i am not willing to pad lazy pvpers stats personally
---
I'm fine with this change but you, CCP, need to do a much better job at planning your changes and having a strategy for this game. You are currently jerking us all around with changes you make one week just to back away from them the next. The "Season of Chaos" should not be an excuse for you to not have a plan. Creating a chaotic gaming environment for an established game in an effort to stir the game experience up is an admirable idea. You guys don't seem to have a plan and are just throwing random ideas against the wall to see what sticks. Get your shit together! It shouldn't be a "Season of Chaos" for us just because you guys can't form a coherent strategy for the game.
---
To unlock the ability to jump, There should be a hacking minigame which must be completed within one minute but no sooner than 50 seconds after start. The minigame can only be started on a Npc station undock or outside of tether range of a citadel.  If the hacking fails you can start again right away to keep it balanced. 
---
Upon successful hacking, nodes spawn through the constellation you are in which must be entosised to power up the jump drive isotope converters. The JF must remain undocked and untethered for the duration or everything is reset to zero. 
---
This will add some chaos to JF's
---
I used a t1 hauler for ages without a problem, it's a totally valid option so stop wanting everything on a silver plater dude.
---
You assume too much from me, and keep missing by miles. But sure, keep trying if that makes you feel any better.
---
Good luck finding solutions in forum bitching.
---
Some of the best moments in my early thirties and late twenties was flying with Templis. I feel that so many of us havr moved on because of all the reasons mentioned in this post.
---
1. 3
---
2. 10-15 hours a week
---
3. Moderate to high risk, but that is because I am bad at the game and have to have my buddies come save me from welping.
---
its still available (the reddit pitchfork team didn't protest hard enough)
---
That was not clear in my post. The thing is that with larger group, at any given time you connect you should see more people. When an enemy come to your space, they too will see more people to fight. If they are not enough to face you, they can go home. If you face them and they are not strong enough to face you, they will ultimately move away, collapse, or recruit to face you.
---
So if you live somewhere where there is a large group, you will have to grow or to become part of them. Or have a group of an equivalent size.
---
With small groups it's easier for a new group to come because the threshold for survival is lower.
---
For the time, it's linked to this. In FW it's easy to have a short session because it's easy to find opponents of your size. Or at least it was. The time to gather a fleet is proportional to the number of men inside.
---
Of course I'm talking about the "pirate" type of player. But EVE is an ecosystem and pyrate and carebears need eachother. But I'll get to it tomorrow.
---
You're life must be pretty boring if this is a cause you fight for.
---
What is the entire population though?
---
Ask Mass if he remembers fighting two Vargurs with exodus? This was when he was in MOA.
---
I remember doing that with antibiotics when I learned npc buy orders were a thing and that people just dumped them from missions, 10 here and 20 there.
---

If isk was payed out according to click intensity roqs would be on 1 mill and hour dreads would be on around 500m and supers would be somewhere between 20 and 30 billion isk an hour.

it's your not you're. this does provide some fun to my existence, well pointed out! go grab a cookie, you've earned it!
---
I'm actually in favor of the changes and I feel it's more about balance than anything. Force projection was still out of control. It made entire regions practically invulnerable to any sort of real assault.
---
Delegation is your friend.
---
Lol. That or a spool up for jump drives. 6min per LY traveled. So a 10 LY jump takes 60 min to spool up. Unable to dock or tether or spool is reset. Has to jump within 5 min after spool up or the ship self destructs. Hacking minigame to determine which region you land in.
---
Interdiction immunity?
---
1. on all my accounts i have lost probably 6-7 PVE ships. . (raising ADMs suck.)
---
2. maybe 12-14 hours total. 
---
3. 3:1. When i am not trying to raise ADMs i usually run DED sites which are actually pretty safe to run. It takes a bit more attention than running an anom, but the isk is better and you can just bounce if something super spoopy shows up.
---
Stealing expensive things increases sodium production.
---
Nope sorry.
---
You can get great fights everywhere.  You just need to find a group that wants the same kind of content, and you need to learn where you can go to find the fights you want.  
---
That does require a little work.
---
The other comment about ratting in a PvP ship is great advice.
---
You’d be surprised by how much managing 3 dreads take for one person. But Yeah, soups are more apm intensive but are able to stay aligned and have the ability to light a cyno and call in for he.... oh wait.
---
EVE sure is losing its reputation as a cold, hard game that drops you off in the middle of a vast universe for you to figure out
---
Now it just guides you through the early game and gives you a taste of skill point injections
---
And we wonder why skill injected rorqs and supers are so common...
---
How would that make JF hauling more risky?
---
Then it will finally be the pirate infested den of scum and villainy it was meant to be. Enough of this farm and fields bullshit, that stuff belongs in lowsec/hisec.
---
Also, you forget that pirates need to make money too. We're just not so pathetically whiny about it needing to be safe.
---
A lot of people play for the investment in the game. If you just removed that I wouldnt be surprised to see ~20% at least of the playerbase just never log in after the reset.
---
Which also leads to asset safety. IF something came up in real life (medical emergency, family issues, unemployment etc) which meant you couldnt log into the game for a period of time, but when you came back all your assets were gone because Goonswarm didnt like the way you looked upon the Mittani etc? A pretty good way for people to good "I had a good run but thanks for all the fish" I do agree however that it should be limited to say fortizars and up and maybe tied into fueling/fitting as well, that way abandoned structures could end up as loot pinatas.
---
Structure Timers: For active, manned and defended structures the timer system isnt too bad. The fact that you can throw down 100 raitaru/Astrahaus that follow the same timer mechanics without being fuelled or fitted just blows. Grinding out up to 9 day timers cause troll citadels werent thought of to be a problem...... 
---
Do I think the POS reinforcement timer system is a better mechanic? To a point. If not well maintained/planned you can gimmic out a favourable timer for the attackers which means the mechanic isnt 100% in the defenders favor 100% of the time. It requires activity to make sure you get the best out of the mechanic.
---
Resource Sarcity: This is one I can both agree on and also say its missing the mark completely in another aspect. Resource scarcity i high traffic systems would be an interesting experiment. Higher used systems have longer respawn timers on belts and anoms. Lower used system have lower etc so it prevents having 30k players in 10 systems but it wont encourage the wars people think will happen as currently the reward/risk/effort ratio's for wars are completely out of balance and the fact that it takes magnitudes of effort and risk for such little gain has lead to a stagnation of the game.
---
Moon Mining: An interesting proposal but does mean you now have to attack mining fleets under the threat of citadel guns. Good and Bad IMO
---
&gt; Barge fleets are content... 
---
This I really have to disagree with. Barge fleets are fish in a barrel for someone to shoot/bomb. The fact that the scalability of rorqs was never questioned/considered is more of the problem IMO. More active gameplay for the rorq would have stemmed the madness (think fighters on carriers)
---
Not gonna lie I had a tent up the whole time I was trying to type that
---
The spool up is a good idea. 
---
Eve just needs more hacking minigames in general.
---
Like hitting d scan has a 5% chance to make your scanners vulnerable to space viruses. If it procs you have to complete a hacking game. If you fail you lose d scan for 1 minute and appear on local.
---
The Activity Tracker should have SP rewards. Gives new players a feeling of progress.
---
How many Reply you got from your corp m8s?

We'd need his definition of casual also...
---
You think this would happen, a lot of expierenced players want nothing to do with managing you guys.
---
I keep seeing the term "whaling ops" tossed around and can't help but be reminded of my younger days hitting up the bars...  it was a sad life...
---
Remove jump drive -&gt; add interdiction immunity
---
Interesting and well thought out. Reminds me of that other post that talked about Eve's original appeal, which was to conquer and that we've now conquered Eve. In a way that what made Eve fun is gone because of our human nature to stabilize and create peace. You point out a different take and it's interesting also. I think you're right and that shows that CCP needs Eve to change. They need new players and the game needs to change.
---
Maybe the real future is in a new game, rather then maintaining and reinventing the existing one. But I doubt that's as feasible. 
---
All of this has also made me think about the future of Star Citizen because it's doubtful they can overcome the same problems CCP is facing. 
---
Time will tell.
---
I already lose ships I cannot afford ha !
---
2x Tengu, 1 Barghest.
---
I plan on next to loo
---
se my Machariel or my Vindi while I'm drunk af lol
---
I agree with your considerations, but I think your arguments are something we can't deal with, nor CCP can.
---
What CCP can do is to slow down this process, and all they did during the last years went to the opposite, injectors, xl citadels, blackout and now cyno changes, but mainly the first two.
---
I completely understand and agree with people quitting the game, they invested a huge amount of time, money and in game resources to build their dreams, it could be a titan, a super, a rorqual or tee perfect JF hauler.
---
CCP behavior since the introduction of injectors is like spitting in their eyes.
---
Those people are the base that sustain the game with their subscriptions, maybe they don't buy plex because they invested ton of resources and time to be able to sustain their expenses, but they are a constant income for the game.
---
Injectors are the main cause of this mess, injectors caused capital proliferation not null safety (null has always been safe).
---
Someone will argue that rorqual is the cause of the excessive capital proliferation, but think about it, with the exception of titans rorquals are the longest ships to train, they require ton of SP just to sit in the ship, and I'm not considering Panic or excavators training.
---
Without injectors we would have only  a small fraction of rorqual pilots we have today, same for titans and supers.
---
But the damage is already done! Well CCP can fix it if they want:
---
- turn sp injected back to injectors
---
- limit injectors use to toons with max 5M SP
---
- give people a free SP remap per toon if they used injectors
---
But new players need injectors! They will flee if they have to wait months or years to be competitive.
---
That's false, it was like that since this game was born, everyone complains about it but it was not a problem until they introduced those damned injectors.
---
And it's not true that a new player needs injectors to play, fleets are mostly in subcap, today like it was in past. Capital ops are still rare and today most of the use of these capitals is because of this crazy proliferation caused by injectors.
---
Already have my aliases in all lower 48. Mother fucken Trump baby

Unfortunately there’s not a lot out there to shoot at these days near where we live.
---
hmm why cant i find it in google store? i can see only the old version ...
---
This is an interesting point. It's clear Eve must reinvent itself. Also expected the player base will fracture and get upset by the changes.
---
IOS
---
You can just say "Remove Jump Freighters." It's the same thing as your suggestion.
---
why?
---
0, which is good... I was thinking if I should leave the corp and rename my account, but luckily nobody cares
---
Which is understandable, since only the sender knows the answer
---
That's really sad to hear. I think CCP definitely should revamp management, no way people should be like having like a second job even if they are the leader. That's just unfun.
---
&gt;im talking about the general lowsec pvp punishments, u find tons of non suspects in plexes and shit...so u loss sec status when engaging them.
---
&gt;wheres the logic on that?
---
When you’re in LowSec, look at the top left of your screen. Does it say something like “Gallente Federation”, or “Amarr Empire”? There’s your reason: you’re in **empire space**, and shooting someone that doesn’t have a suspect or criminal timer is *illegal*.
---
You commit a crime and your security rating drops. It’s the same in HiSec as LowSec. Shooting someone in the most gang infested and least-policed area of Chicago is no less a crime than shooting someone in front of a police station in Beverly Hills. The difference between the low security of Chicago and the high security of Beverly Hills is the available police response. It’s the same in game.
---
If you want to PvP without losing security rating there are two areas and two mechanics for you: NullSec, wormholes, war decs, and factional warfare. You can also choose to only engage legal targets.
---
LowSec is not “a PvP area” any more or less than any other area of EVE. If you want to live in empire space, you obey the law or deal with the consequences.
---
You still have the best char name and I still think you need to yolo a solo dread.
---
Ty
---
EVE is not a theme park or an arcade game. Actions have consequences.
---
I just looked up “eve portal” in the app store, opened the listing for the old app, then tapped on “CCP GAMES” to see app releases by the same author
---
The new app was then listed
---
not a bad idea.
---
Saame ! I went to help a random new guy who was stuck in the tutorials because I didn't know what do of my evening.  
---
I was with my Talos and I reckon I lost it when he told me that my ship was huge and he thought couln'd play long enough to have a ship like that.
---
I transfered him 500M ISK and bought him 1 Talos and 1 Megathron so he can buy plenty and lose plenty :D
---
Yeah, it's stopped working for me too... Someone is maintaining Evernus currently, however, I haven't tested it myself so give it a shot for yourself :) http://evernus.anver.ee/
---
Three anything seems impossible for me i have very bad muliboxing skills. Honestly i think high APM PVE activities is a mistake. The less click intensive the more complacent the target is. When i was super ratting i never missed a thing going on in local or in intel channels. I was there hitting buttons like a madman. I never roq mined but i could imagine they went entire seconds without glancing at local or dscan.

barkys corm storms!!!
---
Do a walk of shame, and burn your SIN's
---
but yeha, hope nothing bad happen haha
---
Flew alongside you lot in MC and occasionally afterwards too. Usually a pleasure. Gotta respect the willingness to let something end rather than stumble on in living death. 
---
o7 
---
Until you return.
---
While I think skill injectors have contributed a lot to what's wrong with the game, I have to say that even as an old vet the recent skill point events have changed my game experience immensely for the better. It's allowed me to try aspects of the game I wouldn't have put SP into training if I didn't have a pile of unused SP burning a hole in my skill queue, and after all these years I'm finally getting a little into solo PVP and have gotten a few kills. It's given me a new reason to get excited about logging in.
---
You can get shot in HiSec so your argument is really: don’t undock.
---
interesting argument. Well done, you win.
---
I had... They removed it! :(
---
T1 hauler is fine, L2 MWD/cloak trick.
---
I was gonna make a shitty spai joke, but only Horde spies would communicate with their superiors in Evemails trackable by ESI
---
Fobs, invasions, exploration, pvp, abyss, etc...
---
Lots of options, come try it out!
---
Someone upload the APK somewhere please! Yes we know there is a code etc etc etc... but we can't fiddle and try to get it to work without the APK in the first place! Even if in the long run it ends up not working.
---
I'm proud of you
---
who uptooted this woot of whex
---
Only thing more universal than trit
---
post here with system you plan to do this in
---
That's not what I meant or was trying to find out. I was trying to find out how to avoid ever having the same issue as the OP occur to me; I had sometimes thought of hosting a LAN party with a friend (who is Alpha, I'm Omega) but after reading this thread I'm never ever doing that if there is any risk of some automated system banning my Omega accounts for "alpha abuse" the second it sees both them and myself logging in under the same household IP address.
---
psshh... manage Theta for a year and I might consider you legit.
---
Maulus navy is the king of venture bot hunting. 4 points scram with range bonus.
---
Where ever you are you are blue to me. Much love to the man who first inspired me to pvp and then took the time to show me how it's done. I'll be waiting and hoping you will return. MASS A DEATH corp will always feel like home.-Kayi
---
Lol. I can't even sit in a cruiser or online a medium gun. I took the name pretty seriously! Couldn't resist training destroyers though since they use all the same guns as frigates :)
---
Achievement unlocked: Kafka trap.
---
Correct me if I am wrong but, are you seriously implying that Rote needs blues to win fights?
---
... who?
---
Have corp.
---
Not interested in recruiting at the current time.
---
Why did you literally draw an arbitrary line from the first peak, the the last trough. You can't do a graph that way dude.
---
You are basically comparing a peak play hour/day at the beginning of a period of time, to a trough/lowpoint play hour/day at the end. 
---
I'm not suggesting that there is NOT a slope. Because there is. But your representation of the data is you drawing a line from the high peak to the low trough. No.
---
Remember when Goons hated miners? I ‘member.
---
I know that Ninja Uitoh is still playing as a CEO, after loosing 25 Billion ISK in leading WAMPS.
---
That's not silver miner that's gold miner
---
Do you think as a newbro I got 8 months to fiddle around with the game to figure out if I like it or not in such a busy clustered game sphere these days?
---
The biggest barrier to entry is that everyone else has been playing for so long and you gotta wait months to unlock things that are time gated rather than skill gated.
---
Hahaha what a load of bollocks
---
Settle down, boomer.
---
flew with yall back in the MOA days for some time, o7 old friends.
---
Literally what the guy is talking about.
---
Out with the old, in with the new.
---
Trot to build the ship, salt to fuel it.
---
I have no intention of being a free kill when counter-play doesn't exist. 
---
I do however enjoy that my advanced levels of no content for you has caused such a reaction.
---
This makes no sense. Are you trying to compare the trillions of isk worth of assets in the umbrella with what exactly?
---
weak copy and paste, try harder
---
&gt;haha I said boomer haha fuckin gottem haha
---
So what, you can deny the attacker loot by moving your shit like literally at any time right?
---
Gas Giants kinda look like that though
---
i mine
---
That's not what I meant. I was trying to find out from /u/CCP_Falcon how to avoid ever having the same issue as the OP occur to me; I had sometimes thought of hosting a LAN party with a friend (who is Alpha, I'm Omega) --- but after reading this thread I'm going to throw them some cash to upgrade themselves to Omega. I'm not letting them login as Alpha in my house, ever.
---
That's September patch.
---
Lol youre funny!
---
Lets change something today, see the direct results, ignore them and wait a full year? The scientific mind at play!
---
Thats a shader test sphere. It's fine
---
Thank you for picking me up when I was down. You are a good guy.  Have fun hunting, fishing, boating and off course snowmobiling! All the best!
---
Victory.
---
It's almost like they're not actually new player but sock puppet accounts meant to try to put off the image that a particular stance they're advocating for is more prevalent in the community than it actually is....
---
But my man, they are calling it a test:)
---
Not arguing against that. But they do affect in a stricly positive manner.
---
Just check on this reddit man, bots in NS are not gone. They have adapted. And I saw a massive uptick in exploration bots in NS before the blackout.
---
he made funny ones?
---
wait like what?
---
I spent a decade in low and null before I came to CCP.
---
Ive been gating a carrier around null for a week and no ones tackled me yet. Ive also been dropping dreads in random citadels within 10 or so jumps of my staging just to see if anyone will fight me. Nothing yet.
---
So far we have never seen them fight us without a laundry list of blues. We've incredibly reluctantly temporarily blued with our neighbors and one friend of theirs as a matter of necessity.  
---
   
---
Rote has brought unspoken, no visual, jag, nsh, pinecone, and many others to literally every fight. The funny thing is it's mostly no visual structures/sov that they've been defending.  
---
I've seen them do the usual stuff vs phorde or other newer groups, but fighting any entity that fights back...yes, they seem to need their blues very much.
---
just make a zero capitals version of eve, lmao
---
&gt; You are not authorized to download this file.

You cannot join safeblob. Maxrisk
---
In theory sure. But that only happens if we get inflation which we didnt have pre-blackout, we actually had deflation. What we are seeing now is inflation which means that your isk is worth less today than before. 
---
Theory and reality arent the same. Im not saying I like bots but their effects are massively exaggerated and the data doesnt support the theory.
---
The damage done to the economy due to the age of chaos is much much worse than bots ever have.
---
My first week or so in EVE I met a Russian with broken english. He needed to move a hulk and I had a Badger 2. I dunno why he needed it moved. I can't recall if I thought about stealing it. I moved it for him and he gave me a strip miner worth about 1M isk. I was so happy.... that was 11 years ago.
---
Would be funny watching Cheetah pilots blow themselves up by initiating a medium length warp an instantly draining the capacitor to 0
---
Why did you start the slope on some arbitrary day and part of the graph?
---
Eh, bloody file hosts, try https://filebin.net/i0w88hxvb2msyfed
---
Stoopid roun eye
---
I understand the investment aspect which is why I think a very gradual change in this direction would be best for the game. It's a difficult issue. On one hand eve isn't a theme park and we should do what we can to stop it from becoming one. Eve should be dangerous and not everyone should be able to fly every ship without the player skill to do so. On the other hand, carebears support the games monetary stability so we would need to ween then off of the ships and tools they shouldn't be flying rather than slapping it our of their hands and encourage them to commit to the game if they really want to be using that stuff that bad.
---
I don't like the concept of structure timers in any form. I feel like structures that aren't actively defended should be vulnerable to destruction at any time. FAX's could be reworked to heal structures instead of ships maybe... I'm in favor of removing timers completely and reducing the unanchor times drastically to compensate.
---
Resource scarcity won't fuel the wars but resource famine would eventually imo. That combined with lack of structure timers would force players to be proactive to hold their power and secure the limited resources.
---
I imagine small refinery's wouldn't have offensive capability's. So fighting under citedel guns would be situational. Ore anomalies would also be a large part of the meta and account for a large % of available ore.
---
Barges wouldn't be fish in a barrel if rorqual's provided AOE damage resists to mining ships. Also mining fleets should be defended with a combat fleets anyway. If they wanna shoot your miners they'll be taking return fire while they do it. 
---
War's should take place as a series of battles often as an attack on another players industry when they are forced or choose to expand beyond their reach. In the asteroid field, at the hauling caravan, in the hacking site eve. Mining barges, haulers, explo ships, etc... these ships should all be actively (generally defensively) engaged in these battles that make up the war. Then again I'm a starcraft fan so that might be where I'm drawing my inspiration from but I like the idea of all of these "units" being a part of an interdependent system that operates in close proximity to each-other our of necessity.
---
10b? You gotta pump those up those are rookie numbers
---
I left one too. Felt great
---
I mean, it is the same thing with the old app. Nothing new
---
Nothing like instant gratification to make the game more enjoyable for you.
---
wrong.  kids play minecraft and they play it endlessly. you are only playing eve because it was all you had, all you knew. and it will stay that way because you dont have any time or patience to look for a new game.
---
That's a macro dude. You can time it and see it's more precise than what a human would actually do. It tics at the same interval every time.
---
Beginning of graph when set at 3 months = arbitrary.
---
👍
---
Thirsty gamer boys lookin for that space water.
---
 Made me chuckle. Take an upvote.
---
this post was a bunch of wishy washy bullshit that didnt really address what really is wrong with eve.  and its that the wars everyone want to happen in eve, literally cant happen because the game cant handle it.  and now enough people are aware of this, that they either have left the game because of it or tried to steer their activity and the activity of others away from such goals, knowing the unpleasant end result.  i dont know how you wrote all that bullshit without mentioning this ultimate game killing fact, seems pretty obvious to me.
---
EVE Online is a game of niches. What CCP needs to do, as the playerbase ages and younger players (with a different culture) start the game, is to expand available niches.
---
Some people just want easy, fast, accessible PvP for the sake of PvP. While I personally disagree with that play style being congruent with the nature of EVE, it is a valid play style. Factional Warfare is one way of promoting fast, accessible PvP - FW is basically perfect as a concept: You can make enough money to fund PvP doing it, making this money is a net ISK sink (LP store), and the PvP can be as casual (small gang T1 frigate roams) or as involved (caps) as you desire. There are some issue with FW as it stands which need iteration, mostly concerning bots, neutrals, and citadels.
---
Some people just want fast and quick PvE and to make a few bucks. Abyssals got that covered.
---
I think changes to LowSec to make it a more viable place to live are in order. Upcoming cyno changes might address that.
---
NullSec definitely needs to get nerfed hard. It's too easy, safe, and lucrative. Resources need to be rebalanced and there needs to be depletion. Sorry but infinite resources on demand is broken. Infinite resource at a much slower trickle makes more sense.
---
The UI definitely needs a major overhaul. Especially PI. PI still needs the option to "save configuration" and to share configurations. I'll write more later but I have to nap before class.
---
I remember 🧠 reading 👓 his posts 📝 and LAUGHING😂😂😂at his shit💩posting about the gate⛩to stain🌃🌠. Now he's👨🏻‍🦰just another goon🤤NPC whining😭😭😭😭about how eve is dead☠️😵
---
That’s obviously not what I meant, you absolute fridge. I meant the vertical tarting point. Common sense would’ve suggested starting on one of the peaks.
---
120,000 is less than 320,000 so I don't see the problem here...
---
Don't respond if you don't have a clue to what I'm talking about. This is about the hypothetical covert cynos that were going to be implemented. Yes you can scan a JF once it jumps. If you d-scan exactly when it jumps. If you have probes out and ready. I would cyno in a JF anyway if I saw probes on scan. And if you manage to scan them in time you need to warp to location. Hardly 4 seconds pal.
---
I think you think you're far more important than you really are.
---
Also there was a time your group would have foamed at the mouth for this kind of content, yet here you be.
---
The ingame map has an option to show the systems you visited for example.
---
So elite.. an exploration Heron.
---
The hero PH needs, not the one PH deserves..
---
You'll be a worthless F1 cog in no time flat. Well done.
---
Im with you. The game is old, it needs brackets to differentiate players far more than the current system does. But the philosophy of the game prevents it, which is why we have so few players atm. 
---
HS should pretty much be free of PvP, FW space should become larger and not allow caps. Supers should be allowed in LS but they lose all their perks (so logistics dont get fked up but theres no point in using them there anymore), LS gets isk they can live on and so on.
---
We need, like you say, real progression and to get rid of tons of complexity in the game to allow for a smoother newplayer experience. 
---
But without these things, NS is the only place that can actually keep the retention up. I dont like it, I would much rather have a vibrant HS, LS and NS but its better than players just leaving the game because its too complicated and they are lost.
---
And also, you say something massively good that people keep forgetting. People need to be able to play with people on their own level. Right now small gangs are getting buffed to be able to take on NS more easy. But nerfing NS hurts when big gang wants to fight big gangs. And its still not good content for small gang, no matter the buffs.
---
But like I said, the games philosophy is holding the game back. If people were to actually start accepting that you cant eat the cake and have it we would be able to get changes that will allow us to start a new golden age.
---
I'm new to the game, and newer to the app 😅
---
So do I lol
---
You know what. Not terrible idea.
---
It's a mystery
---
It's still on their web page
---
A Corp like you guys will be missed :(
---
Have the iOS app, it looks gorgeous :-)
---
"Remove Jump Freighters."
---
OR 
---
Remove jump drive.
---
Add interdiction immunity (and a little warp core strength?)
---
Allow them to jump through a personal wormhole to any C2+ J-space system that has a JF beacon set up by inputting the beacons code before jump. Disable JF's from docking or accessing cargo of any kind in J-space to prevent unfair j-space logistics. With the right intel this would allow you to find a shortcut to your destination through J-space with more variables in the path and more travel time = more risk without heavily sacrificing identity?
---
I did the same thing with Long-Limb Roe a couple of years ago. It’s not even worth contracting to an alt to pick up.
---
Your home looks familiar...
---
Delet this
---
The game would crash and be unable to recover if jita 4-4 actually got destroyed. So much old code is anchored to stations.
---
Delete me please.
---
Lol.  That's straight out of a space opera.  Love it.
---
Heard about it and can fly it, but lacking a lot of gunnery skills. My drone skills are essentially 99.99% perfect for an alpha clone though.
---
Though I doubt I'd really need the rails for venture bot hunting anyway and just let drones rip them apart.
---
This doesn’t change anything about that. If anything this makes areas even more secure in some ways through flex structures.
---
Using the exact same time on two different days paints a pretty accurate picture.
---
I was taking the bait until I got to "rorqs should provide AOE damage resists" lmao, nice troll post
---
1) 10 losses / 296 kills
---
2) No clue, usually around 4+ hours a day
---
3) By what metric? I frequently fight against overwhelming numbers in small gang fleets with my mates in the enemy staging system, where I live, and I often field expensive T3Cs or capitals behind enemy lines to gank carriers and supers.
---
That said, I also use evasive tactics to counter the numerical disadvantage and work hard to gank my enemies in ways that reduce their ability to fight back as much as possible. Stealth bombing (bombs or torps), sniper tengus, hotdropping, etc. The risk in those activities comes from getting set up more than the execution, and often involves very blingy ships. Might only lose one rarely, but man those losses hurt.
---
People rarely fight over moons now. It wasn’t the content driver POS’s were.
---
All this will do is increase citadel spam of more athanors and region areas just changing what places they mine every few months.
---
You can take down a Flex Structure. A massively tanked supercap with Fax support, not so much
---
It is very different from buying a character on the bazaar. They come with a fixed set of skills, which may or not be what you want, and you can't use them to add SP to your main character (before extractors and injectors). And while people could farm characters for the bazaar, it was a long term investment and you had to be very confident in the meta to farm e.g. Naglfar pilots. Now you get a guaranteed stream of SP from a farm.
---
"i could go and fight for x resource, but i know if i stay here it'll just turn up eventually - so why bother going and fighting for it?"
---
Don't bother. There's nothing to see. Someone else already did it. It took years. 
---
Seeing as you frequent r/eve you probably already know eve will be dead by then.
---
Ok thanks
---
No it isn't. You can time the interval and see they're more precise than a human could naturally do. Not to mention the amount of strain on one's finger after pressing the button that frequently for a prolonged period. You would never maintain that accuracy much less keep that up for the length of time he's doing it. It's a macro and he just busted himself.
---
Wooow, mister! I'm new too and that's awesome!
---
You sound like a nice person. I bet your dingaling is as huge as that Talos. ;)
---
Don’t have to awox with blue scouts especially covert cynos. Traditional click click warzone and let’s queue In instanced games for immediate gratification and play candy crush shouldn’t apply to Eve, develop escalations and intel and kill, not this it’s so hard to hunt bs. Work at it.
---
yes... but were you exposed to Theta?
---
People have already posted this boring ass opinion. Take your own advice and throw away your computer, you grumpy old fuck.
---
So much edge.
---
/r/eve asked CCP to deter botting and afk accounts.
---
CCP went after these people.
---
/r/Eve surprised when these people do not [log in.](https://i.imgur.com/sohWhy9.png)
---
It would take you dramatically less time to take down this mythical supercap than a flex structure purely because of damage caps.
---
I don’t understand even remotely how this cyno change would make it easier for people to “assault” areas like Branch, Delve, and Southern Drones. It’s not difficult to use beacons to get into systems that are Jammed, recons can be fax repped and get well over a hundred thousand EHP, and defenders would still have a significant advantage of being able to use ansiblexes to get around permanent bubble trap systems in certain areas.
---
The only thing these changes do is make it somewhat less convenient to escalate pre-planned fights such as timers, much less convenient to escalate response fights, and significantly less convenient to escalate organic fights such as B-R. The meta post-changes will be to attempt to get on field and actively deny your enemy a chance to reinforce or counter escalate. Whoever arrives first with caps will have a massive advantage that didn’t exist before.
---
Story of my life
---
Yeah you retards ruined the game enough that no one wants to play it
---
Thankfully CCP has finally pulled their heads out of their asses and are trying to address this
---
Fuck yeah let's kill more reason to fight over things.
---
All the best mate hope you come back at some point.
---
Pretty but buggy. Mail can't send. Back button on the Android OS does nothing. Back arrow in the app will exit the current task versus going back to the already typed email. Doesn't save drafts. It's a bit frustrating.
---
GL in real life.  o7.
---
Yeah Idk why the app does that, so much spam from it
---
Maybe the seed coukd be tied to MER. Higher MER= 
---
Lower chance of good moons.  Could cause some issues with the crabs getting rowdy.
---
I know it could do that, I'm just a sucker for lists and organization.
---
What would your response be if it was factually reported by CCP that most of the accounts not logging in are.. in fact, not bots?
---
Another thought. Players don't play because of their investment in the game. They play because of their investment in their idea of what the game is. When the game can't live up to that idea or present something better people are gonna leave regardless.
---
I also realize I didn't mention asset safety. I just feel like its not hard to keep some assets tucked away in case of emergency. I know IRL stuff comes up but the hardcore aspects of EVE shouldn't cater to the individuals inability to keep up. It sucks to lose stuff but if people are so attached to their linear progress in EVE that they can't enjoy starting from the bottom when they lose then they shouldn't have that stuff to begin with.
---
Eve should have amazing immersive content for all play styles but the competition at the top should be ruthless and won through skill, commitment to the game, and involvement with ones community. Anyone who thinks they can mindlessly grind isk and skillpoints to success should get their castle knocked over if they overstep into dangerous territory.
---
Will pay 100m ISK to whoever gets this to work lol
---
This is generally an excellent post and it's a shame you linked it to 'reee cyno nerf' in the title and conclusion.
---
I don't agree that compressing space is a good idea - the size of umbrellas is already so large that the blue donut can project pretty much everywhere. Or at least, if they were to compress space then they need to nerf capital mobility to at least an equivalent degree.
---
Anyone who sticks it to the goons are good guys, we'll miss you **MASS A DEATH**
---
NSH already did lmao rip
---
Well, I somewhat agree that Eve shouldnt slow down because some cant keep up. It goes against the idea of a sandbox and the philosophy that Eve should be dangerous. But many dont agree, why we nerfing NS atm so small gangs can stand a chance.
---
Asset safety shouldnt be removed but we do need a new structure for offensive warfare, staging citadels. Those can have asset safety but we also need a revamp of fozziesov and we need a reason to fight. In that world it would make more sense to lose asset safety on certain types of a citadels.
---
Logistics is the one thing you dont ever touch in a game like Eve. It will kill NS faster than you can imagine if it got nerfed in any major way.
---
Yes, we need more destruction in the game. Which is why we need NS to actually have a reason to fight in NS. Small gangs are cute but they are not what brings destruction (in comparison).
---
Rorqs should be able to mine but without excavators. They should make less than a hulk. But honestly you can do it another way, just dont allow Rorqs to siege within lets say 500kms of another sieged Rorq. This way you drastically reduce the amount of Rorqs in play and force people to actually use barges.
---
Not yet
---
As much as I’d love that to be true, it wouldn’t do anything. 
---
I love the idea in theory of how athanors forced people to mine the moons, by putting ships in space, but the sad truth of it is it was a failure. There simply doesn’t exist enough people in eve to cause conflict over these moons. There’s more than enough to go around, and it’s a lot of effort/time to mine them.
---
Honestly having athanors passively mine 20-25% of the moon value would generate some content over them because then there would exist some minimal effort way of controlling moons and making isk, while still keeping the status quo of people in space mining them.
---
Oh except if it’s an industrial phone it can use cynos
---
&gt; they won't actually ever blue each other seriously (TTT stuff aside)
---
The TTT pact is demonstrating that they will, in fact, effectively blue each other rather than fight over valuable resources.
---
Only to mining ships and only to the degree that its balanced as to not make them "fish in a barrel"
---
I'm getting mixed messaged
---
" barges are excessively vulnerable to bombers to the extent that it makes them unviable"
---
"AOE damage resist buff for barges would be OP"
---
Idk hard to win with yall. which is it?
---
Yes.
---
And as I said, only log offs and awoxing (logs only barely) can get anyone but the most incompetent.
---
The sp has been awesome. Really helped round out some playstyles i was hoping to get into
---
Bet you're the life of the party...
---
Yes, i am (the other fried didn’t give avatar because i didn’t have titan v, but after mass test i will) i’m on sisi now
---
That's cool that you want to make content, but relying solely on players to do so is why we are stuck in the first place. 
---
We need aspects of the game that we cannot control well as players that give us reasons to be out doing things. PVE has always been the driving factor behind the game, without that we have a shitty pvp game that requires you to grind for stuff to shoot with.
---
Spreadsheet would be my guess. Or message the person who did it without losing a ship and see if they will tell you how they kept track.
---
I bet you have download 1 TB+ of Alex Jone's podcasts
---
* 1 loss across two characters
---
* About 33-34 kills.  
---
* About 2-3 hours a week on average over the last 8 weeks. Usually one fleet and one response to a tackled rorqual.
---
and buy skills from the market
---
That was kind of my idea for a ORE titan. It's DD/industrial core would enable it to go up to a moon and do a moon pull similar to an athanor. You'd be able to choose how long of an extraction it could do but you'd have to be stationary for however long you set it for, similar to a rorq with an active indy core. It could also have a boson DD that  you warp to a normal belt and boson all the rocks and vacuum them into your hold, again... you'd have to be stationary to do it. That would allow people to come in and ninja your moons and belts but at a lot of risk to themselves.
---
Aside from having to spend all of that time re-scanning, it's not a bad idea at all. I'd upvote it.
---
I dunno about you, but I RF random peoples citadels just to poke the hives and see what swarms all the time.

Is rather be exposed to the open Chernobyl core than Theta and, by extension, you

---
I really miss the learning skills
---
If you would like to try pvp as soon as possible, there is a tons of fight in low-sec (Place where you can shoot all the baddies). I can give you a discord link and you join us whenever your ready. Learning with others bros is always easier and funnier. Hit me up if your interested, don't worry about ships, we will provide them for all the fleets. o7
---
Few people have demanded it be safe. That's just your kind projecting your prejudices onto us. 
---
All we really want is the rewards to warrant the risk, which it doesn't. Right now - short of super ratting - you can't even out-earn basic high-sec mission running. Things like incursions and high-level Abyssal running make null-sec income from subcaps downright laughable in comparison. - I don't buy it for a second that you "pirates" will throw your killboard stats down the drain to get out-earned by level 4 mission runners in high-sec either.
---
Not that I think you'd actually stay in null after all your targets have left. Sets of nano gangs *not* engaging each other, and blops groups failing to find anything to drop on, will quickly leave in search of the soft targets they really want.
---
I love small gangs and I think they should be able to damage larger groups in some small ways but I'm not asking for them to be able to overthrow a large group alone. NS fragmenting into smaller groups wouldn't force everyone to small gangs, We'd still have plenty of reasonably sized empires I think.
---
I agree with your points on Rorqs :\]
---
I'd like to see capital ships in general work optimally only when placed apart from each-other to give battlefields less of a blob structure. Perhaps specific formations which could be formed through some kind of autopilot system which must be maintained for certain command bursts to work.
---
'This needs to be its own post. Great idea
---
I have no experience using Android, much less developing for it, but I get the impression that the wide variety of devices and software versions means there’s no easy list of what is and is not supported for Unreal 4, unlike Apple which can say “iPhone 5S and newer” or similar. 
---
Here is the [official compatibility doc.](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Platforms/Mobile/Android/DeviceCompatibility/index.html) it talks about “profiles” and capabilities but I don’t know how you’d determine those for your particular phone, sorry.
---
Sure, when I get home.
---
I am coming from Linux so previously I had to build it myself from Krojew's sources, unluckily the guy maintaining the site you linked does not provide executable for linux nor the source, which could be considered dangerous, also the evernus domain was already bought by some fishy ad service:/  
---
Also the problem now is probably that the EVE API has dropped the Evernus as application from their thrid-party app list, looks like they have to be linked to a valid domain.
---
I like doing something of that nature. I just take it a step further and wait until I think they are almost asleep and poke their private parts to what response I get
---
Investment is great. But this is eve. Investments should be (more) vulnerable, especially outside of high sec.
---
I’m on a 6s Plus and it works just fine. The store says it works all the way back to iPhone 5s and iOS 10.
---
I've heard that somewhere before
---
Ghey, that's all!
---
What damage would **that** be?
---
then good luck convincing your entire coalition to uproot and move.
---
Doesn’t show up in the App Store tho. Also are you sure you’re not looking at the old eve portal
---
You can store literally everything in a citadel and move it risk free, albeit at a slight cost. In wh space you risk everything you have in the hole, hence why evictions for loot are a thing...
---
yeah getting those newbros hooked on instant sp, the first taste is free, the next one is the low, low price of 250 plex
---
CCP's behavior reminds me of back when the CIA started selling crack cocaine to inner city neighborhoods
---
Found the wumao
---
maybe try n recruit less mouthbreathers then? Theres a fix to your problem you know
---
Good luck brother
---
&gt; I meant the nullsec hunters who think this whole change will mean more frags
---
I don't think that's why people are happy about cyno changes. It's more about not getting capitals dropped on you at the drop of a hat when you're trying to engage anything.
---
Has no one successfully balanced hobby and their significant other? I've been in a relationship for 10 years on Aug 29th and this has never been an issue.
---
I only seem to be able to add new skills on my omega account.
---
Couldn’t you do something less obvious like put his face on a “Payday” poster with the bank being robbed being eve on fire with pve ships being destroyed or some shit?
---
This is lazy copy pasta
---
I agree with you and that's part of the reason I made this thread. We have the creativity and motivation to do cool stuff in eve but the environment and tools are lackluster at the moment.
---
I'm all for PVE content; however, I'm not sure how much of that should be AI spaceships. I feel like there should be more survival elements to eve that require us to go out and interact with the environment and fight with each-other over the needed resources.
---
It's less of a grind if you're a resource extraction ship forced to go into the battlefield and survive while extracting. If all resources we're contested nothing would be a grind.
---
It's because of the wardecc, you need to wait until it ends.
---
Send isk to Sadic Anark in game. TIA.

F! Its sad to hear this but im glad we had a chance to fight together!

Best wishes for all of you!

Discord already has an app.
---
even more so i think
---
Guns are optional for ventures. Neuts might be an option for high slots if you go after atrons or executioner bots. Tristans can be an issue though bots don't usually fight back.
---
T2 scram is really useful with maulus navy and some kind of scan res boosting mod to reduce lock time.
---
yawn
---
Looking at Eve Portal 2019... and yes you can’t seem to find it via search in the App Store, but follow the store link in the article above and you get to it.
---
They still apply.
---
Not sure about the actual math but building components in bulk does give a discount.
---
That's going to be a sad reminder
---
Check online numbers from before blackout and now.         
---
Now  ... did we truly had 8-9k bots online or we actually lost so many players.        
---
Online numbers are still dropping.
---
...till he makes off with a Keepstar.
---
1 : 15-20, counted alts loses.
---
2: many at the firsts three weeks, have less time since
---
3 : Its relative as I flew a cloaky loki alot, but I took a lot of bait and small camp or roamed while locals had possible gatecamp setup, It paid off sometime but often I found myself feeding badly.
---
Oh ok nice. Ccp put the app in the iTunes Store. Great job
---
Yeah yawning is literally what the entire playerbase is doing while EmPiRe BuIlDeRs tell them structure grinding for no purpose is good content. Not that I expect someone of your *very obviously* limited intelligence to be able to manage more than doing what someone else tells you
---
I feel like going out and mining anything valuable should always feel something like resource wars with players instead of AI basically.
---
Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer.
---
You're meant to have fun in life. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Have fun with it. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.
---
Even the worst thing we can do here is good. And maybe, maybe, maybe... Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it.
---
I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. In this world, everything can be happy. It is a lot of fun. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast?
---
Oh Look another #MemeCSM post using someone else's ideas and then fucking it all up.
---
Oh man y'all are pathetic.
---
Moon's haunted.
---
This....i'll line up with other responsible adults to be killed by CODE with Eve Classic.
---
The comment section of this post will fantastic. There's not much better content than watching morons reeee for more safety while promising that they love PvP!!!
---
What do you think of this jump freighter change?
---
"Remove jump drive.
---
Allow JF's to generate and jump through a personal wormhole to any C2+ J-space system that  has a JF beacon set up by inputting the beacons code before jump.  Disable JF's from docking or accessing cargo of any kind in J-space to  prevent unfair j-space logistics. With the right intel this would allow  you to find a shortcut to your destination through J-space with more  variables in the path and more travel time = more risk without heavily  sacrificing identity?"
---
Sounds like something someone too bad to build an empire would say.
---
Imagine different people with different opinions. 
---
Barges are vulnerable. That’s the point.
---
And another fine Dick envy poast.  WAHHHHH you built an empire and I didn't wahhhhhhhhh   CCP it's not fair!
---
a pretty great guy started a whole alliance based off this concept close to a decade ago
---
As /u/ahengle says, you can't reduce past 1 per run.
---
just a tip for the math:
---
ceiling(max(runs,round(Base Materials * ME modifier * structure modifier * rig modifier*runs,4))
---
ME modifer is (100-ME)/100, so an ME of 6 is 0.94
---
structure modifier and rig modifier is calculated the same way. the smaller than 1 value. 
---
Rig modifier is multiplied by the sec status modifier, before being subtracted from 100 and divided.
---
All the rounding happens at the job level. (the round(,4) is there to deal with a pesky floating point issue)
---
The only dick in sight around Big brain Bill, is the one CCP is ramming inside.
---
I think there's just as many other players who would jump ship if the game continued in the direction it was going.
---
tl;dr
---
Yeah, was thinking about just using an inty and having it warp in once main was in position. Thanks for the advice!
---
Sounds like something someone who is equivalent to an NPC would say
---
Make a better argument.
---
Reactionary behavior doesn't actually tell you much about reality.
---
Hmm I didnt think about smart bombs. I'll have to play around with some fits. Thanks!
---
I agree that they should be vulnerable, just not to massive cloaked burst damage...
---
The apk has been compiled for arm64-v8a ABI; it can only run on 64bit Android firmwares. Unless CCP recompiles it for the 32bit ABI (armeabi-v7a), all of us with older/cheaper mobiles are f#$%ed
---
What a dick!!!
---
Lmfao dude that’s gold
---
I'm hoping some people show up with decent responses and not just complaining about you.
---
Maybe you could explain how it's all fucked up?
---
Are we still doing the whole "Pretend PCU is representative of the health of the game" thing? I love this one
---
It's on the list right after the lowsec gate to Stain.
---
You're not *that* new here
---
I'm feeling really attacked right now.
---
perhaps you should spit the dick out, it doesn't belong to you.
---
LIGHT THE CYNO!
---
Excuse sir, we are conscripts of the mighty empires. We PvP only so we are not thrown off our lands!!!!
---
implying the earth has 5 years left :\^)
---
Because null players catching up now is joining the donut and training into a ratting carrier.
---
&gt;But scarcity wasn't a reason for rivalries since B-R times. 
---
Since basically ever, but yes.
---
&gt;The rivalries died, because of the new umbrella meta actively introduced by CCP with citadel patch + Rorquals + injectors. 
---
Nah, not everything boils down to this.  For one, some rivalries lived on well into the modern era, not really ending until the entities themselves did (see: Co2).  The dying of the rest is easily chalked up to a stagnating, aging playerbase with well established entities where the leadership regularly hangs out together.
---
Good thing every field is as bountiful as one could possibly want! Now no one has to PvP, we can all just get rich!
---
This was actually something I was thinking. As a newbro, its frustrating when you *really* want to play the game to have to wait weeks or months to do something. When I start a game like Eve, I want to get right into higher tier stuff so I can learn. Which is why I left HS so quickly. These SP boosts have been huge in helping me finish off both skills that are fun (new ships, better weapons) and skills that are needed (like Cap Management V, etc).
---
Get fat and rich. Ping is out? Oh let me sit on the Titan for 30 min for maybe a fight.. wait nope no fight. Alright back to the colossal.
---
He has to wait for his Alliance leader to comment on this before he can make an opinion
---
I have the solution to all the capital reeeeeeeeeing
---
Behold, the super-duper capital. The size of a keepstar, it wields the might of the gods, the power of complete grid erasure with the push of its blackouthole generator button.
---
Bristling with a vast array of 128 high angle weapon mounts, able to single handedly crush entire fleets of titans, it is the pinnacle of might throughout all of new Eden. 
---
The Galaxy itself will tremble at its arrival.
---
Fucking stupid game ruining muh isk/hr......
---
Either way is fine.
---
Decent responses help foster a civil debate for the good of Eve.
---
Toxic flames gain me more CSM votes.
---
Does smartbombing missiles still work, aka known as firewalling? I see torpedos have 375hp which means I should be able to kill them with 2 large smartbombs if they are timed right.
---
I'm a little evergreen. I always try to see the best in people.
---
The sinking ship and delusional reddits has been a great source of entertainment. We all know CCP will continue to the "age of chaos".
---
Nullbears cried so hard about the cyno changes - mostly concern trolling about the impact on skill training and JF pilots, even when they aren't actually the things they do - that CCP changed the cyno changes to remove the one thing that gave you a new ability.
---
You mean you're making another 150 accounts to get re-elected?  #HypocriteCSM

Use your brain if it isn’t so full of spod already

Remove asset recovery = fixed economy and capital proliferation
---
Doors  break on iron wills scum.
---
ohhh sweetie. quit it. that 90% is ringing right now
---
So what are you playing now-a-days? 
---
I'm another of those players whose formative eve-years were spent reading great posts by the likes of you and Jester ... heck even Gevlon was good for the occasional tinfoil-based laugh.
---
Also join the channel SF Spectre Fleet in game or one of the other many NPSI groups. Not always the most experienced FCS but usually very fun nonetheless.
---
&gt; In the end, it is very probable that Eve won't survive a transition to a more sustainable game. It catered to the low risk PvE side of the game too much for 5 years. At this point, the game might have lost enough PvP'ers to the compensate for the PvE players leaving the game. Moreover, the sheer propaganda and organizational powers of null mega empires do not make it easier to balance the game against their interests. Even Hilmar is getting so much flak, so I am not even surprised why I am getting it.
---
&gt; I think we should remember that at the end of the day a video game is essentially a piece of artwork. Yes, it is a moneymaker, but the money will flow only if the art is good. The best pieces of artwork, software, websites, etc. are made with that assumption. Eve is an extremely niche piece of art which defies the standard industry practices. But there are enough people in the world to enjoy this niche.
---
&gt; Therefore, major design decisions should boil down to making the artwork as interesting and fun as possible. And an interesting/fun Eve doesn't involve completely casual players boson ratting with no individual/personal requirements; just because the industry is casualized. Even WoW still have Mythical raids. In contrast, an interesting/fun Eve is where multiple PvE/PvP playstyles have a legitimate place.
---
We dropped on a few ratting domis at the same time as a wormhole gang warped on them, had a little fight with them in the haven. Was very good content.
---
i can't tell if they're very fancy meteor impact craters or cool lunar cities, which is what i was hoping for. kind of assumed the space elevator would connect to one
---
we are all dumber for having read this.
---
I think you both miss the point of my "investment"
---
These are the people who have invested lots of time to gain blue print libraries, alts, skills, resources, infrastructure to be able to do what they want to do in game. 
---
If you turned around and said you need to start from scratch again tomorrow I guarantee there will be a good portion of players that go "got better things now to invest all that time in"
---
Interesting rebuttal. I am enjoying these essays.
---
Something that appears to be undisputed is the aging player base and life changing which translates into different gaming experience, wants and desires, such as complaints about it being a time sink. But this seems to ignore the realistic need for new, younger players who will put in that time sink. To me, this points out the obvious need for CCP to reinvent the game in modern terms in ways that appeals to a younger audience while doesn't completely alienate the existing base, which is a huge undertaking. 
---
I'm not sure that the industry is casualizing but Eve is arguably falling behind. New players must buy the game and that simply means the old time players just can't be the primary focus. CCP needs to find a way to be around for 20 more years with a seemingly stagnating game.
---
Can we call it "The Derpstar" ?
---
This is exactly the point. I have a newborn at home and can literally walk away from CK2 (or Rimworld or Dwarf Fortress or Stellaris or or or) at any instant and that is just incredibly important at this point in my life. 
---
It means if I want to undock in EVE at this point, it basically is VERY late at night (when the other kid, wife are asleep) or in something so cheap I'd happily sit it on a gate in Amamake for the hell of it. =)
---
I get around this problem by not having 648382 accouts
---
imagine literally being told how to vote by a bloc ballot-sheet
---
Thats an awful lot of words I didnt read. But im assuming tldr is caps bad ree goons
---
Oof
---
Loved it dude.
---
I got a switch so I've been binging Zelda and RDR2. Right now I'm not able to focus on anything because I'm supposed to be studying for a promotional process. But I have so much work my little brain is fried.
---
I've been doing a lot of reading. I backlogged on reading while playing. I'm catching up on the expanse series. I stopped counting my book reading by March when I was somewhere over 20 books for the year. I read 12 on my cruise back in June. So, a lot of reading. 
---
I log into Eve but I just don't have the focus to play anymore. Plus, my dogs don't really get me needing several hours of undisturbed time. When I was playing my dogs were all older. I got Inty at the very end of my time on the CSM. Puppies and Eve playing don't mix.
---
I miss the people I had good times with. I don't miss the seething anger that floats atop the community. All that constant negative energy exhausts me.
---
Remove asset safety at the same time remove ALL NPC stations. Nothing safe ever!
---
Honestly, I don't think EVE *can* survive in a recognizable state. The main appeal of the game is, really, consequence. If your ship blows up, it, everything contained in it and all the work that went into it, are most likely lost for you. Sure, some things might drop and the wreck might get salvaged, but probably not by you. This principle used to carry into all aspects of the game. It's what made battles like Asakai or B-R special; what gave them their gravity. They were real strategic setbacks for the loosers and resounding victories for the winners. People in and out of the game were amazed by the organization and economical depth that was necessary to make the costs and implications of those battles as quantifiable and apparent as they were. Some of the indirect effects and lessons from those battles still affect the meta and economy today. 
---
But since then two things really happened: 
---
1. The gaming industry at large has moved away from those very consequences as a driving factor in gameplay, and most players either don't have the time to, or don't want to, sink as many hours into achieving alliance goals and building up assets to then blow them up *for fun*.
---
2. EVE has lost its consequentiality to a degree. Citadels with asset safety, cap umbrellas, rorq mining and infinitely scalable PVE have led to players (and entities) not feeling as much of a sting when loosing assets as they used to. The leadership of those entities has also gotten much more risk averse (or strategically smart, however you want to call it), which is why the poster-boy massive nerdfights that are the big appeal of this game don't really happen, or if they do, aren't as decisive anymore. The last B-R caliber fight I remember was X47, and we basically instantly pulled back as soon as we noticed we *might* get fucked.
---
So to sum it up, EVEs style of gameplay is simply not as interesting to the general audience as it used to be (and it was always a niche game) and even the ones that interested are loosing that because of gameplay changes, some inevitable through a maturing and developing player base, some through poor design choices on CCPs part. 
---
I am convinced that EVE will essentially "die" for all intents and purposes as soon as the chaos era ends (or when CCP does something even more unpopular than the cyno changes). I simply can't see this game being around in three years from now. Sure maybe people will still be online, but EVE, for real this time, will be kill.
---
Man Dave, not even you can be that stupid
---
For the listed example of engineering complexes you have to cancel the jobs and thus forfeit the materials for it to deny your attackers from getting them.
---
Im typing it right now hold please.
---
Could always RMT to keep that from happening
---
Can you hurry up? I look rly dumb because I don't know what to parrot yet
---
Shit, I’d considering quitting if I lost mine. Trading is how I make all of my isk and I rely on that a lot. Thanks for the heads up. Making a copy tonight.
---
one thing great about warframe is that i can just jump into action immediately, do my 10-20 minutes and leave :) still i am gonna be with eve as long its there and i have the time
---
oh, there was never any doubt. I'd like to see more grovelling, please.
---
Are you including Jovian space and w-space, or just k-space?

&gt;OP doesn't explain how he identified bots
---
they're just fleet warping stop making false accusations
---
&gt;OP explains why they are bots
---
stop telling programmers how to fix their bots!!1111!
---
Long pretty well out post and then every single suggestion does exactly what you said we should not do, trying to fix symptoms instead of cause
---
As long as when it shows up on grid, Slayer is played at max volume throughout the entire constellation regardless if you have sound on or not. Then yes, we can call it the derpstar
---
haha jokes on you if you actually read it
---
But you all told me all the bots got banned. So they can't possibly be botting.
---
A massive amount of small ships should be able to destroy a structure eventually. All the defenders need to do is break out the rusty smaller ships. And caps will still serve their role as they will make dropping a structure 50 times faster if brought in offensively, and the defence will need their cap fleet to stop it.    
---
But everything under capital really needs to become relavent in actual war again. Back in the day bs with fighter wings for defense were used to drop POS. The battles that ensued were epic.
---
Trust wouldn’t mean anything if he steal your Keepstar.
---
I want to puke
---
imagine not hitting at least 1/10th of the fleet with that many bosons
---
Actually OP made an observation that is explained by a mechanic in game.
---
I'm trying to discern when I went from going "BBTB2 has a point" to "Is this drooling retard ever going to write anything that isn't WE DA BEST AT EVERYTHING AND CCP IS ALWAYS BAD XDDDD"
---
I too know of a game mechanic that allows me to auto-return to mining exactly 5 minutes after I warp off
---
Have you not read  hilmars Twitter feed? This is new change pre overview blackout
---
Sweet Jesus. I've seen some stupid shit in this sub, but goddamn.
---
you can move a blueprint library in a luxury yacht and be 99.9999% safe    
---
you can't asset safety alts, skills and infrastructure in the first place, so any changes to asset safety wouldn't affect that
---
No. Don't twitter. It worked fine yesterday as I said. Give me the short version
---
please.
---
Problem it would be the best scout ship.
---
&gt; CCP to reinvent the game in modern terms in ways that appeals to a younger audience
---
Issue is that this likely requires an overhaul of the core moment-to-moment gameplay. While EVE's gameplay may have been pretty good in 2003, in 2019, Mobile games often have much more engaging moment-to-moment gameplay even in this same genre.
---
EVE's depth is great, and I don't think we need anything at the engagement level of star citizen or even ELITE, but something a bit more than what is essentially a text-based RPG with a visualization.
---
I’m glad you mentioned the age thing. I started at 16-17 years old and now I’m 33 but at the beginning I was already playing with older players. We are the old people now. We grew up with different types of games. :/
---
It could be worse though.
---
Because it may create a situation where the goon horde now has a motivation to just stomp over all space.
---
But they would also have to deal with opportunistic strikes back home.
---
I'm joking I think. It sounds to me like you have unchecked some "states" in the settings or have overwritten other saved tabs by accident
---
Works on the LG G6
---
You should do the opposite, the more NPCs killed in the system, the worse it becomes for ratting.  We want people to move, not congregate.
---
&gt;!Remindme 5 years
---
 !Remindme 5 years
---
You know that Uitoh is a stock name that the game suggests, right? Not everyone with that name is the same player.
---
Hmm might try re importing saved overview..
---
They had a huge issue with a seller not producing Nyx models
---
I'm so tired of this "player base is getting older" shit as if the whole player base was 16 when the game came out and nobody has joined the game since unless they were also 16 when it came out... WTF is this? 
---
Firstly, EVE has always been known for having an older than average player base. Why was this argument never seen in say, 2006?
---
Secondly, players of all ages and lifestyles play this game, nobody gives a shit if you don't have time to play anymore, that was your choice, just quit and go play a casual game.
---
How does this fix either of those? Asset safety is by-and-large used by AFK people, and capital proliferation is fundamentally removed from asset safety since people have to, you know, undock to use the capitals that proliferated and oppress gameplay.
---
&gt;perhaps they shouldn't do it in the space that's supposed to be risky
---
If it wasn't risky you wouldn't have to constantly have a fleet of faxes etc ready at a moment's notice to save people.
---
Of course some people will be able to balance life and hobbies, but we are just remembering those whose lifes are just too hard ;)
---
Can we alternate between Primo Victoria by Sabaton?
---
Dude's not suggesting a reset. He's suggesting mechanic shifts so that entropy keeps up better with creation.
---
Guessing you didn't see the OP before the edits.
---
You do have options to reduce it.  
---
Like you said, injectors are definitely an option but there are more.
---
You could sub multiple accounts and have each character training towards something specific.  (The multi training on one account isnt worth it IMO unless you are going for a support character IE trader or planetary interaction)  When you do multiple accounts it lets you utilize multiple characters at the same time.
---
You can also buy a character.  This option is good because the character retains its value and can be re sold should you not enjoy it. 
---
Then there is learning implants and attribute optimization.  IE if you are training certain subsets of skills they all use the same attribute you can optimize your attributes to cut down almost 30% of the training time.  
---
Sure some things take a while to skill into, but you can do a lot with low skills.  Many players have 50-100 million skill points and at any given moment they are probably only actually using 10-20 mill sp.  Hell many alliances still use t1 for most of their doctrines.  It looks like you are really far behind but you really arent.  
---
For example if we are both flying t1 armor cruisers using lasers.  Sure I might have max gunnery skills but I am only using the skill points in lasers and support skills.  The months I spent specializing projectile and hybrid are useless while flying that ship.  The shield skills and missile skills will also be useless.  Shield will give a tiny bit of benefit but nothing really notable.  The real advantage comes from organization and the Fleet commanders ability to take the right fights.
---
It was always fun fighting you guys and gals! Fair winds and following seas!
---
Sunk costs man... spent 15 years on this baby... gonna see it through instead of cutting the losses.
---
&gt; Check online numbers from before blackout and now.
---
I've mostly ignored this argument, but I guess it deserves more. Let's start with the obvious: all else being equal, more players online is better. A bot is less valuable than a human player. A multiboxed alt is less valuable than a main. An alpha player is less valuable than an omega player.
---
The factors that I would consider are the content that you generate for yourself and the content that you generate for other people. CCP will also consider whether you pay them money, as they should.
---
Note that a plexed alt grinding a PVE activity that scales well scores just about *zero* on two of the three factors listed above. You aren't getting much marginal entertainment out of multiboxing your 5th Rorqual. Some, I'll grant you, but you're engaged in a rat race. The more ore you and your competitors mine, the more ore you have to mine in order to get the same isk reward which you turn into a fun reward. (Rorquals are just being used as an example here. This applies to any heavily multiboxed PVE activity.) If you PLEX your alt account, then CCP is not getting any real money out of that alt, so that one's precisely zero.
---
This leaves only the content that you generate for other people. And that's what the blackout is addressing.
---
We'd all be happy if the online numbers went up, but it's not just about bots. It's about the bots *and* the multiboxed VNI alts run by humans. It's about how one casual strategy was dominating another casual strategy so hard that it warped EVE's economy. It's about making the explosions easier in nullsec, because CCP's bet is that is healthier for the fun ecosystem overall than just adding more players to it.
---
That's a good point. 
---
It would be interesting to see actual data on this. My point is just that as a player ages their likelihood (on average) of playing the game most likely decreases, therefore new players are essential to the survival of CCP. How CCP addresses that problem will probably irritate parts (and a vocal part) of the player base.
---
I think this is what's happening right now.
---
If you get pointed you're pointed. I don't typically spend much time bumping people but I'd assume the idea is to bump a freighter and keep them from warping long enough to get enough dps ok grid to kill it before being Concorded
---
Hilmar isn't destroying THE game, he's destroying YOUR game.
---
This right here. I feel that most FW corps understand this and make their corps as newbie friendly as possible.
---
If a newly elected CSM member is saying that 'eve is dying' ... i think it is bad.            
---
Let me tell you little secret.          
---
Pve nerfs is one thing, cyno changes another - but in most of the cases people that i know that quit stated something very simple.       
---
**"If they wanted to live in WH space they could do it long ago"**               
---
Blackout was one of the dumbest CCP ideas.         
---
Sure it killed big part of botting, but also many people that disliked the idea of lack of local - some of them lived even in WH space, but found it quite unappealing.                  
---
Well, i hope that CCP will think of something and invest cash in making eve viable again instead of going for small (1/0) database changes.              
---
Did i lost faith in CCP?        
---
Yes - like how many warning signs you wanted to have before you actually see that you are moving into wrong direction.              
---
**But those are healthy changes for game** well i don't say no.       
---
I only say that current player base don't want to play game eve is becoming.             
---
Funny as it is EVE is one of the few games that cannot hold new players, but those who hook up play the game for years.             
---
The hope is in PA ^(like WTF), unless PA will decide to reset the EVE and actually kill it - they are the people who will need to do something to actually fix the game and put work into it ... as guess what they bought the game for a lot of money.
---
I do know Random. Check out my name on Eve Who and you'll see why. I also know who's alt Maliu Galax is and it isn't Random.
---
I'd say you're barking up the wrong tree but what you're barking up isn't a tree at all.
---
I believe so. It's a little tricky to test.
---
tried importing old overlay. No good. even opened windows calc to make sure nothing wrong with the number keys. They're fine.
---
/u/ccp_fozzie if your 'golden non block child' on reddit is saying you are killing the game then CCP really fucked up
---
You know that HK is back in rage right? They still have pretty much complete control over c6 space too. 
---
I don't know what you think has changed, but the reality is that the destruction of hks keepstars was just some structures getting killed and not some radical shake up of wh politics.
---
I like this.
---
I have read a variety of posts regarding the blackout and Cyno changes some containing the highest levels of REEEEE from both sides of the argument and some very balanced defending their positions with reasoned argument accepting and debating the others point of view. In the end I submit the final arbiter will not be the great and benevolent god bob but rather Alan from Accounts. Alan will look at income as against outgoings and tell CCP either the Blackout and cyno changes were the greatest thing ever and CCP are making bank or they are losing money hand over fist as omega accounts begin to drop to Alpha (obviously this is a step process as they will all not drop at the same time, but Alan has this covered in his financial projections) and unless something changes quickly they are going down the tubes.  If in the opinion of Alan its all good standby for even more chaos perhaps on steroids if on the other hand Alan is not happy stand by for a screeching turn under the cover of "Balance" In the end we are but dust in the wind and Alan will decide what way its blowing.
---
Please show us on the doll where the mean Empire man touched you.
---
Damage caps, and the sheer number of subcapitals certain groups can field, makes that impossible. Without damage caps you could easily single cycle any structure with a massive dreadbomb, and with them capitals are useless against structures.
---
Yeah you can't join because of the wardec. Sadic is right.
---
goons bad?
---
The fantastic nebula we have in EVE don't really exist IRL (at least not in the density and variety we see ingame), but at this point they're pretty integral to the look of the game.
---
You cannot ignore online numbers when they drop like 8k ^(some say 14k but i guess they compared weekend to normal work day)    
---
Still those are insane numbers.              
---
Instead of blackout CCP should address multi boxing, rorquals ... but no this bring $$ .... well shit, i guess now finance guys will need to ask PA for some cash as the online numbers are going constantly down.
---
Yeah this is dead. Numbers are what matters, and the Meta for a long while has been shifted to consolidation.
---
In the past they could make a
---
Difference since the citadel expansion however and skill injectors its all a numbers game now
---
Definitely impact craters. Would be awesome if systems like Jita, Amarr, New Caldari, etc. had unique models for populated moons around the trade/lore stations though.
---
One of my favorite things to do is to help a hard working newbro with some isk.
---
I had a newbro die in an astero after getting a dank 150m relic drop, and I could hear in his voice he was dejected.
---
I just quickly wired him 250m isk, told him to keep up the hard work.
---
Next post you're going to be telling us how this is great for goons and terrible for the little guys because only you have the manpower to deploy moon bashing sigs (spoiler: nobody cares)
---
are you in a command position in a fleet
---
Things like the TEST Friendship Cyno Fleet are probably why they thought about this tbh. Permalight nereus' on the jump route from Jita to their staging.
---
That makes sense. The guy maintaining Evernus commented in this thread, so maybe shoot him a pm and ask him to upload the source somewhere?
---
How dare you disrespect Yodik
---
Flew with a few guys from MC basically same as other Alliances/Corps some main players either stopped or restricted play time due to RL issues. The others tried to step up but its a massive commitment and in the end they couldn't make it work so they disbanded. If there was drama those guys never mentioned it, shame I enjoyed fighting them they were good opponents.
---
When I say reinvent, I mean to shake it up, improve the UI and graphics.  Eve is a tremendously unique game. SC is working to be Eve, but I'm very skeptical it will ever be par to Eve's complexity. 
---
I don't think the data supports the idea that gamers are all "mobile gamers" (Although that market is growing, but I don't think it's at the cost of the other markets). Last I checked, strategy, grand-strategy, and RTS were among the highest revenue grossing genres for PC gamers.
---
How long are the cycles for a reasonable moon extraction? Yeah, never mind...
---
Not in a fleet at all at the moment. Was using it to tag wrecks in terms of priority determined by cargo scan. Hmm I might have still been in a fleet from solo frigate abyssalling earlier. You have to be in a fleet for tag to work?
---
Where in the requirements for CSM did you see anything that said they have to be in a specific alliance for longer then a year?
---
To be eligible for the CSM, applicants must meet the following requirements:
---
* Your account must be older than 60 days at the time candidacy applications close.
---
* Characters on both Alpha and Omega accounts are eligible to run.
---
* You must have a history of honoring the EULA and the Terms of Service. We will screen every applicant thoroughly and EULA/TOS violations on your record can result in a rejected application.
---
* Your account must have updated and correct information at the time of your application. This includes; your real-life name, correct date of birth and the same email you use to submit your application. To view and edit this information go to the account management website.
---
* Candidates must have reached 18 years of age. If the legal adult age in your home country (the age at which you have the legal capacity to enter into a contract) is higher than 18, that number applies instead.
---
* As an applicant, you must consent to provide your personal details to CCP, including your real name and a copy of your passport. CCP needs to affirm your real-life identity for NDA contract purposes and the ability to travel to summits in Iceland is a key function of the CSM.
---
* If you do not currently have a valid passport, we will accept a picture/scan of a valid and approved passport application accompanied by a picture of your driver’s license.
---
* You must consent to share your country of origin with the EVE Community and having it displayed on the EVE Online website. You will not be required to share any other personal information with the EVE community.
---
* If you are running as an “alt” and you control a character that has a reputation in the EVE universe, CCP may require you to run under that identity at its full discretion.
---
TL;DR classic wow dropped today.
---
Sadly it seems to be going the way of star citizen. Turns out all those paper pushers that push "genius" game devs to get something on the shelves actually serve a purpose.
---
How about that.. I fleeted with myself like I was with the abyssalling. Tag works again!
---
ASUS Zenphone 2: It is not supported :(
---
I didn't have the idea that gamers are mobile gamers.
---
My point was just even mobile games have more engage gameplay than EVE does on the moment-to-mlment basis. Let alone serious PC games.
---
The graphics are pretty amazing in EVE, but they're glorifying unengaging gameplay.
---
I for one will miss you - we had good times when we lived in Fade and Pure Blind as MH, GSF and SMA. You were spot on as an enemy and are one who will be firmly in our memories as legend. Good luck in whatever you do and hope you return at some point.
---
o7 fella.
---
That was the problem! I would usually solo Abyss first thing in an EVE session and never bother to leave the fleet. Thanks Bro!
---
Strong the Autism in this one is.
---
exotic dancers, please
---
Seriously, dude is a fucking disgrace.
---
I would be happy with blacker sky in space. Amarr regions are especially overly bright.
---
Every game needs new blood to stay alive, my point is that their age is irrelevant. I'd wager retirees have quite alot of spare time to play EVE if they so choose. ;)
---
&gt;It would be interesting to see actual data on this
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVWC6I-FLEA
---
Just admit it, when you were a newbie you probably asked equally dumb questions.
---
I’m hoping that people would actually fight back.
---
No asset recovery = more caps dying = more caps needing to be built= healthy economy 
---
If you’re going afk, don’t go to nullsec.
---
We're legitimately already having people refuse to start playing the game because the wealth accrual of legacy players.  Without a way to meaningfully damage those stockpiles there isn't much point in competing.  The proposed X% dropped and the rest getting asset safety-d to an NPC station somewhere is a perfectly reasonable solution.  If you get so worried about it you can move to an NPC station and deal with the constraints that offers.
---
My character is over a decade old. There are niches that I have spent months, and some, over a year perfecting. I'm not starting out in a frigate again. I just won't.
---
May the Spirit of your m8's guide you, have fun out of eve and enjoy life! And when you come back someday you find your old friends still hang around!
---
My respect for your efforts and duty's.
---
Sure will.   
---
Also I just finished testing cross-compilation of your REvernus on Linux (MS is already working hard to enable C# on Linux, add Mono to it and it's all starting to look nice).  
---
Unluckily I found that WPF will never be supported by Mono (hard to port) and the issue about making WPF cross-platform on dotnet official github is now two years old and was obviously shot down by MS(?) right from start.
---
Hey, could you please provide the sources ? I would like to get a working piece for compilation on Linux.
---
CCP should actually give new players catchup mechanics of course this would help more alts/bots maybe but the real people else maybe missing out. Also they could implement catchup mechanics for Omega's only or something.
---
My EVE installation has become cancer aswell, it's just eating my free time!
---
Do I want a dedicated alt for FW? Where's a good place to look to get into FW?
---
I actually just asked this to Signal Cartel, and brought up a few of the logistical challenges to it. The holes are obviously numerous, especially after the recent change that led to ~60 being a normal number of active holes, from ~25. They also don't let you warp directly to them, making it take much longer to pop in and out of holes. Their lifetime isn't always 24hr like most other wormholes, and iirc despawn much quicker. Then there's also the Drifter Menace that will hyperdunk you if they catch you.
---
Tldr: massive pain for little gain.
---
&gt;I'd wager retirees have quite alot of spare time to play EVE if they so choose.
---
Sure, but twenty-somethings moving into family/professional life are, as a group, going to have less time for games like EVE that ask for quite a bit of time/effort, which has always been what's being referred to there.
---
i help newbros with isk or ships always, but i make some stuff out of it like a trivia time etc. and only characters which are younger than 90 days and no alts are allowed to enter etc. :)
---
What would you be looking for in an "Eve Classic" ? Less ships to fly?  Less stuff to do? No players with quadrillions of isk? Honest question, not sarcasm.
---
Yes, sadly WPF is a Windows-only framework for the time being. I was considering using Avelonia to allow the project to be cross-platform, however the framework is still a work in progress, and the DataGrid (which is the most important part of Evernus basically) was still in development when I started making REvernus. If there was a better cross-platform UI framework for C# right now, I would have used it. If one comes out, maybe i can try to port the project over to be cross-platform!
---
Making alt accounts though instead of just alt characters is one of the biggest flaws though.
---
I shouldn't have to make a second account , I should be able to just train my alt, 2 characters but one account timer is a hell of a flaw for a paid monthly game.
---
As an ex Moa and co2 member I've seen Massa Death around.. Sad to see you leave
---
Any time someone talks about building a palantine keepstar, link them this;  
---

---
Perhaps the view provided by Scanner will be more helpful:  http://www.steffengerlach.de/freeware/
---
I much prefer it to windirstat
---
Remove half of nullsec, force everyone together and there’ll be conflict.  Remove half the wormholes too.
---
and not hauling billions in it. If you got that much money, save some multi char training and get a multi training certificate for t2 industrials (or just inject)
---
What app?
---
Plus the in game map won’t help you with wormholes, you’ll need an external tool for that.
---
Good point!
---
thing is most people use 360 degree dscan. i agree that this guy is suspicious but sadly a fleetwarp fail can still mean hes a multiboxer and not a botter unless you have more evidence.
---
Even just the ability to name the modules similar to ships, would really save me some time sorting through a lot of modules!
---
What? Where's this? Agency screen?
---
Oops, didn't mean to attribute an idea to you that wasn't yours. I see your point, though.
---
This is amazing.
---
TBH, it would be nice if you could extract the mutaplasmid from a module so you could sell it on the market. You only get the module back, you don't get the mutaplasmid. It kinda sucks to have a hangar full of modded T2 modules with crap rolls and nothing to do with them but trash or reprocess.
---
Probably took their doll if we are being honest.
---
Im stuck on the authentication screen. After a while it says there was no handshake. Any help would be appreciated.
---
warp off while the bomb is travelling, it's not instant.
---
But then there would be no risk in rolling faction modules.
---
Just enjoy the hatred that comes from the flair
---
It’s like you can be completely serious and still disregarded as a troll no matter what, go nuts!
---
That's ok... Come to Nisuwa anyway : )
---
MC had a little comeback more than 2 years ago but is now folded mainly into PL or NC so far as i saw. Gamestyle with the Citadel and Fozzie and Skill Injectors killed "mercenary capital projection's". Unless Goons/Test or whole Pandafam goes for hire there is no use for it, sadly we only have 4 blocks left anyway in nullsec. Those who life in between are just allowed to exist cause nobody want that space and all want some content grounds to roam.
---
I scan these out on a daily basis for hunting purposes and honestly it would rank at the top of my list for the most mind numbingly boring task in the game. The payoffs are huge but I'd recommend you get 4 to 5 people and all build the map at once cause it's just so aids now with the amount of wormholes.
---
This guy is so fucking dumb its painful read sometimes. Any worthwhile pvp corp/person left Theran a long time ago... dont know why Sort bothers to keep them around.
---
Isnt Amok still Goonswarm Federation? ^^
---
The settings page on iOS has a line item for "Skill Trainning(sic) Complete"
---
&gt; so I used "Reply" option in EVE online app
---
Ok, but twenty-somethings moving into family/professional life existed in 2006 and the default response to their requests to casualize the game back then was to go play WoW instead, why are we suddenly taking this argument seriously? Because those people were 16 then and are now moving into family/professional life and have suddenly flipped their viewpoint? Fuck those guys, go play WoW you casual scrubs. :p
---
Thank you so much for this. I needed some quick SP and didn't know about this :)).
---
Good luck to you and your future endeavors. It's sad to see some of the oldest corps going away, but it's totally understandable. I just thought about it today how old the game is, and that even when I started playing in 2005 a lot of the players I met were in their late 20's  to early 30's.
---
A lot of people did continue for a while, and proved that the old ratting/mining strategies aren't sustainable. The only semi reasonable income source for old-school thinking I've seen so far is R32/R64 moon mining, where the income is worth the feeding cost. And access to that kind of mining is limited at best.
---
You also don't need to be out there literally dying to see the danger. Much in the same way that one doesn't have to literally get hit by a train to understand how dangerous that would be.
---
If you've spent any time scouting gates for whatever reason, in populated nullsec areas, you'll see what I mean. The sheer amount of Stratios and blops droppers (prospects, bombers, prospects, recons, and yet more prospects) shows very clearly how doomed old-school ratting and mining is. It's very clear to anybody paying attention that we are currently living in a blopsers paradise.
---
That is an incredibly wild stretch of the most tenuous logic.
---
in the world of android, don't be a peasant and get an iphone lmao
---
Is this an area-51 reference or a tide ad reference...
---
Ahh is that the new Eve portal? My one year old phone can't run it ☹️
---
Ccp never said they would make more modular ships. They online mentioned cruisers because they are the "middle" ground of subcaps and hence is a popular platform
---
MAGICAL TELEPORTATION OF ITEMS SHOULDN’T EXIST IN EVE.
---
Yeah. But it's nice having my corp rather than alliance
---
Personally I embraced fw when I abandoned multiboxing and alts. But no, it's not needed.
---
Depending on where you play, you can jumpclone or fly to fw space and deathclone, jumpclone, or fly home after _ hours of fw pvp.
---
Tama and amamake are the two biggest systems for fights, I think. They often aren't "good" fights because higher numbers mean more chance of getting zerged by 3 people (lol) or baited or whatever. But the lowsec a few jumps out in any direction from these spots are where I go.
---
I've seen people suggest finding the contested fw systems on dotlan and going there to find people. I haven't tried this.
---
I just fly as a "merc," not actually joining fw, figuring that means I can find fights against other neutral parties and against both sides of fw. Joining a side would require an alt or dedication to fw cause your corp has to join entirely or you join the NPC fw corp. Joining let's you earn LP for capturing plexes and kills inside plexes I believe.
---
So it's like my Goonswarm flair, but even more so? Great! ;)
---
Which has nothing to do with the economy or proliferation. Asset safety is literally the most minimal component to capital proliferation. Supers and titans being dockable, a literal torrent of unending minerals via Rorquals, and about 4 million other things are much higher on the list of things responsible for the flagging economy and everyone and their mother having supers.
---
Nice. Enjoy that adrenaline rush while you get it :)
---
If the risk to rolling faction modules is that important you can just prevent players from extracting plasmids from them.
---
Side panel under Subreddit info --&gt; Wiki/Links --&gt; Flair requests
---
That's not an argument I'm making, and doesn't really vibe with what I've seen argued.  
---
The point is simply that EVE's model doesn't make for a healthy game unless they're pulling a good amount of new players in, which is only going to get harder (I mean, really -- subscription MMOs in TYOOL 2019?).  Lack of good influx of new players + your "average" player aging into more IRL responsibilities = a decaying game.
---
Keep trying to install it. That's just a feature of **CHAOS ERA!!!***
---
Industry is a massive topic and often margins are incredibly tight have a look at this intro page from Eve Uni to give you a bit of an idea. [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Industry](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Industry). Incursions tend to require expensive ships though some groups will let you run in basic fits as long as you work to upgrading them. Invasions as far as I can tell are a bit more relaxed with less emphasis on bling fits and high skills, though Incursions have been reduced ot one rather than two in high sec they make good isk and concord LP is always in demand (you sell it for isk as well)
---
Go back and forth between amamake and kamela, while checking out side systems like Dal. You can almost always find another T1 frig out looking for a fight.
---
Yep, can never get lucky if you don't allow any opportunities to get lucky. Its good to plan for your opponents to be as competent as you can imagine, but you'll miss opportunities if you don't consider the mistakes they might make as well. The downside of only taking fights you expect to win is that you sure feel like a dumb asshole when you lose.
---
EULA conform my ass. Goons are the #1 abusers of input-broadcasting while calling out others for using it and other bots.

damn BR looks like fun but poor booshers :P, is there a reason your bifrosts/storks dont cram 2 boosts each so you never run out of them? (i mean i know you prefer the boosh over boost, but you had enough boosting ships on the field to actually have 3 times backup for every boost you want)
---
We're all ~~mad~~ **bots** now
---
A lot of people here consciously or subconsciously are only still here because of Sunken Cost Fallacy. Take that away, and they leave.
---
Less top-heavy, more focused PVP engagements. Faster to get into and get out of. Not really the way it "should" be, but would keep the flavor of Eve and draw in those who want more instant gratification on login. It isn't just the Fortnite Toddlers either. I have played Eve off/on since 2004, and most of the time I spend unsubbed is due to life/school/work/family. During those times I don't stop gaming. I just shift to a game like an FPS (I don't play Fortnite or MOBAs) or an old-school throwback RPG that I can pick up and put down. Getting right into action is not impossible in Eve, but definitely not as quick as say launching Destiny 2 and just going to a planet, or loading your save in an RPG and going right into combat.
---
Most PVP vids I see, are maximum zoom-out and watching overview with tactical overlay. That's another issue with Eve, imo. Some of the most fun I have in the game is tracking targets and watching them go KABOOM... but I only do that during PVE. It just isn't something you do if you wanna win in PVP (typically).
---
I love Eve how it is/was, tbh. The stuff I listed above is just what would keep it going and draw in more players.
---
True, it isn't all "Classic" Eve type stuff, but even resetting and going back to an earlier starting point in Eve without it being so top-heavy like it is now... that might do the trick. Not really fair to those who spent 15 years building an empire though, is it?
---
A separate game with some of the above ideas, or a game within the game. Join this PVP sandbox, dip out when you are done having battles. Isn't that kinda what Aether Wars is about?
---
Been away a while, just coming back. Sorry if I seem like I'm speaking out of turn... but I'd rather see Eve evolve than die. My only hope is that we'd have sort of offline Eve if Eve ever dies. Just a small game to go fight rats, spin ships and remember the good ol' days. Maybe smallscale P2P PVP even? Something like that is better than no Eve, imo.
---
I agree except the dock denial, the idea is this is for "that one dude who went on deployment but had work and couldn't catch the train back but wants to move his dread back home now", so it needs to be viable for low risk solo moving. 
---
If it costs 30m to light the cyno, that's also OK, it doesn't need to be *no-risk* solo moving. But 300m/jump pretty much kills solo cap ops.
---
Please keep your null sec care bears out of our wormholes.
---
Okay I see where you are getting the laundry list of blues now. I mean they have been buddy buddy with cone for awhile since rote isn't a capital warfare alliance, and NSH in the same regard. 
---
Although, they are a very focused small gang group that does a lot of tht style of pvp consistently, but they also use a batphone (like all entites do when needed) to counter hostile fleets.
---
Just a reminder, Customs Offices, count as Structures, and thus make you war eligible. I think there is issues with transferring them during a war. if you drop all you structures, (Customs offices, and Citadels, ect) then you can no longer be at war and the war will end after 24? hours.
---
I think Abyssals are actually pretty good design overall, but it's the rest of the game that needs the philosophy implicit in the Abyssals.

Didn't he take all the ISK he got and go silent?

Because when it becomes easy and normal to multibox capital ships it becomes an arms race that isn't healthy for anyone.

#WORMHOLER BTW 
---
Honestly wormholers do seem to be a very, very vocal ^and ^obnoxious minority
---
I doubt a bloc f1 monkey would have even realized there was a ship there, let alone warped to it and burned 90km to it.
---
Actually just got back into the game and have to say I’ve gotten a few of my friends into it for the first time. 
---
You know how nice it is to just let my tell me what they want to do, then explain the agent finder thing (new one) is perfect for them to play WITHOUT me. 
---
I can honestly say most players who stuck it through Eve more than likely had dedicated players there to help them learn. Most of my friends who quit said it was because they just didn’t want to play without me.
---
i understand that :) but goons are fine like every other block :). i heard Nc. starts to undock again sometimes hehe.
---
Yeah I was in a different channel talking to just novac guys and it was working fine then moved into that one when I was getting poked about it and it was muted. Just unfortunate setting and one you don’t even know to look for until it happens.
---

How would it be a free loot pinata if there's 100 goon/test/pl lokis that are going to be waiting for it in that j-space system?

Sit on the jita 4-4 undock with a PVP fit T1 cruiser(Cheap ? buy 10), and take duel requests for a while. You should be able to find who you are looking for on the undock.

Where is the evidence these players aren't being replaced though and the decline of the player base isn't because it's a subscription MMO in 2019 or because CCP killed their play style or a million other more tangible reasons?

It just comes across as one of those "this is my personal experience so it must be everyones" type arguments.
---
Actually yeah you're right... Barges should be basically fish in a barrel without a defending fleet to escort them.

Yeah just pay for multiple accounts or spend a hundred plus dollars on buying a character what a great newbie friendly game

There was this one dude that took the “take a t1 frigate and fly until you die, repeat” he took a breacher into GE- at least a dozen times over the course of a couple days and asked the person that killed him questions every time, it was really cool seing him go from not understanding basic mechanics to soloing interceptors. A Corp mate of mine ended up giving him a bil after a lengthy discussion about fitting and flying tactics.

Do you really think they'll form up like that for every single JF jump? If enough people don't go for the JF's the majority of the time and let them pass through in peace they'll let their guard down eventually. Seems like a prime whaling opportunity to me. They can only send so many reinforcements through the JF's exit hole without rolling it and ending up delivering way off coarse.

Oh, nice. Thanks 😊

---
Except you're demanding "famine" level of resources.  That's not compatible with this statement.
---
Which is why I asked what your goal is.  Because right now you're just flailing about in....anger?  jealousy?  elitism?  I haven't a clue because your proposals don't lead to a coherent goal.
---
&gt;Where is the evidence these players aren't being replaced though..
---
vOv  Ask CCP.  It's not an unreasonable speculation, much like the reasons for the "summer slump".
---
&gt;...the decline of the player base isn't because it's a subscription MMO in 2019 or because CCP killed their play style or a million other more tangible reasons?
---
It can, and almost certainly is, more than one thing!
---
my dumm ass not looking at dscan because when i was in wenture nobody attacked me so i felt safe, somehow vexor was more juicy target or there was nobody there when i was in venture
---
Sadly, I have other things that I have to attend to beyond keeping up with whatever the narrative of the day is and how it fits in with the currently mandated doublethink here on /r/eve.
---
If you would explicitly spell out the damage GSF has caused, perhaps some of us *spodbrains* might take it to heart.
---
After all, we do need to be told what to think, right?
---
People will always min/max and find cheeses around the things designed to curtail their chosen playstyle. However, the days of Lowsec piracy and ransoming were fun, but Lowsec isn't what it used to be. More pipes to NS, more Lowsec that matters and needs to be controlled/fought over. Push players out of HS more and make the risk higher, reward a little lower and make it really a struggle. All of the top-heavy stuff prevents this. People will just go to a NS corp and farm/SRP, they'll join a WH Corp that farms and they'll avoid those areas until they have to go into them... but the risk will be "meh," as they have "already replaced" everything.
---
This isn't true for all players, but most people have been here a while and there isn't really anything making them poor and risk-averse. The risk isn't high enough and the adrenaline isn't there.
---
Quick battles, quick payoffs, quick to reship... but maybe not immediately reshipping into something that's worth 1BIL ISK. It used to be you got in fights and then reshipped into your next fit FRIGATE or CRUISER that was waiting on you.
---
I dunno... maybe none of that makes sense. I haven't been a big risk-taker during large stretches of Eve, so maybe I'm part of the problem.
---
The problems are of game design. If reward scaled with risk the game would not be in the shape it is in.
---
Mining isn't worth it, so sure, ore anomalies are equally so
---
Well, they introduced t3 destroyers, but did not follow the modularity of cruisers.
---
Besides reducing t3 cruiser subs, they nerfed at least 2 of the 4 racials into the abyss.
---
Old one let you send mail.(this one does too. Tip, hit the blue plus when composing a mail, to add a recipient. Then search and select)
---
This one does too. Same issue with mailing lists though. You dont see them in the mail view, just the notifications view. Though you can click to read from there.
---
It can also be oneshot by a doomsday in null.
---
It's not harassment when it's based on in game aspects.
---
Sorry Olmeca the original arguments from the original author are more convincing than your arguments in my point of view and taking into account the social aspects of IRL countrys in which most of the playerbase exist. CCP's 0/1 changes on databases won't cater any new player experience or bring a new ui. Those changes don't help rettain players or get new ones. CCP used EVE players for a long time as cashcows for their side projects. Now its time for them to put EVE on the main agenda of investment if they want to hold that cashcow for another 10+ years. Else the cow will die of starvation made from lack of Invention and Investment. Cyno Changes and Blackout are a bad idea from CCP and don't even fight any symptomes actually they will critical affect the life of the patient :P
---
Well you were outside docking range.
---
To send mail, hit the blue plus on the recipient, search for them, then select. The ux sucks there. Just like the old one)
---
Just typing the name doesnt work
---
I was already sold, but i'll resub. After all these years sucking at eve, I get a little weary of the grinding, and go off to other games. But your post has reminded me why I pay CCP. 
---
I pay CCP my sub, so they keep making games. Game these days FUCKING SUCK, they are all white washed bullshit. PC friendly fit the mold, garbage. Like day old mc donalds food, and we just eat it up. How MANY FUCKING CLONES OF A MOD, FOR ARMA 3, DO WE HAVE TO FUCKING MAKE !!!!!1111
---
okay, so anyways TLDR 
---
CCP has BALLS, and Ill pay for that, you can keep your "SAFE" fucking garbage, and go play fortnight/OVERWATCH/APEX/PUBG/ \*\*\*\*\*\*\* with the rest of them.

You'll be doing 3 totally different things predominantly?

This gets my vote. This is probably the only thing I’ve read so far anywhere that makes perfect sense in real world terms. And funny thing is I expect this has been the case for awhile now. I can’t say where I sit with the changes CCP are making but I’m willing to just go with the flow. I’ve had characters in this game since 2004 and have taken many breaks - I resubbed all my accounts back in July and am really glad I did, its been a blast being back in eve and I want it to continue.
---
SNUFF are totally trustworthy guns for hire!
---
 XD
---
Seriously though, I do share the... admiration for true mercenary groups. Although I never been in one, in fact, always fought them. For whatever reason, they always did seem worth of admiration. But, as others pointed out - they are no more.
---
There's a list of every system in the game in the SDE that CCP distributes and steve converts them to other formats at https://fuzzwork.co.uk/dump. There's a CSV for solar systems which excel and other spreadsheet applications will be able to read.
---
To be honesst, i would have prefered they rebranded T3 cruisers as Battlecruisers, and then switched into the same mechanic T3 destroyers have with a "on-the-fly" dinamic change of abilities.
---
It would have been more interesting, without totally encroaching or overlapping with other hulls.
---
yes, fleet with yourself and you'll have tagging capability.

---
My corp uses IRC and Ventrilo.
---
I think that has happened ingame as well? Maybe my memory is fuzzy...
---
MC never really was a "mercenary" though. They only worked for BOB. Everyone else who could have afforded an expensive mercenary force was hostile to BOB and thus unable to hire them.
---
Pandemic Legion and Black Legion were legit mercenaries for a while. They did what they were paid for, no matter who paid. But if you are an elite mercenary alliance you attract a certain group of players. They are all very experienced and opinionated. And so these entities change into just another nullsec entity.
---
Lmao
---
This'll age well.
---
I’ve been wondering about how new T3 ships would be implemented, too. I thought it might be cool for CCP to expand the tactical/strategic mechanics to other ship sizes; tactical ships shift between modes, strategic ships are assembled with subsystems, and they can be found in all sizes from frigate to battleship.
---
Of course, there’s probably a multitude of reasons why this is a bad idea or just not going to happen, and I’m sure you will all tell me why.
---
Cool story.
---
You can literally ask a mod. But your big brain can't figure that out can it.
---
Totally agreed. Lesson learned.
---
Modular ships are, to use a technical term, a complete fucking nightmare to balance. Either they're op as fuck, or they're useless. Because you dont just balance one hull. You have to balance each possible combination. Which is an insane amount of work.
---
No reason to think they would.  The Imperium superfleet hasn't become any more assailable, and living in NPC stations doesn't become more dangerous.  The only thing that changes is how you store your supers until the wave passes.
---
\\o  :)

I fully support your lifestyle choices and I think it is great that you and your partner can get married now.
---
That’s a great idea actually. See I’m running this isk-doubling charity for the orca pilots crippled by the trig invasion but I’m running out of funds. If you send me your isk, I will double it, then send it back to you so you can invest it to get even more isk. Then we split the profit.

Good. Fuck Sgeine and his ilk.

This, but roll back cyno changes, and you have my vote.

Tbh if y'all in null sec all left no one but other null sec guys would care. Like seriously go on leave nothing will change anywhere else lol, maybe less dreads dropped on my cruiser/bs solo roams but that's it.

I do like the idea of moon mining solo in a rorq, but plss no vaporizing entire belts, think of the Spod.
---
There are enough assets in game to keep plenty of empires running for a good while. If the game gets stale CCP can just tweak the resource numbers gradually until we reach a point where all play-styles are both viable and challenged.
---
There isn't a specific coherent goal. This is just an exploration of concepts and mindsets. My attitudes towards EVE are mentioned multiple times in this thread. There's plenty of context to help you understand what I'm getting at.

Dude, you are dead wrong and out of touch with reality.

As long as you only do it once, I doubt it will be a problem.

Remove abyssal mods. They were a mistake anyways.
---
Can you help me understand why it isn’t worth it? From my perspective, having a passive alt sat in a mining barge bringing in a side income while I do other stuff seems to be a decent approach. Space Rock mining is also kinda relaxing, I like to do it while I indulge other interests?
---
Pfff T1 indys are a shit KM, I think losing the odd T2 is an incredibly small price to pay for flying an invincible hauler across the galaxy in a few minutes.

It has a smaller isk value than the cost of electricity to run the game.

I can't even imagine being dumb enough to think this has any bearing whatsoever on reality.

This makes a lot of sense. I honestly don't understand the point of the MCT either. The ones I've gotten from bundle packs got sold immediately.
---
Yeah I just rechecked and now you can find it listed if you search "Eve Portal", this morning it was not there so may have just take some time to post as a new offering...

Honestly, I think they need to fix the sky-box first. Some regions are pretty bad.

---
I have to say that the last 5 months my focus has been in Albion Online, and they got this "GvG season" ...which in itself is just constant war to achieve points and earn cool rewards (special mounts in this case).
---
If there was something similar, that entinced every nullbloc/alliance and whatnot to fight for "e-peen and e-honor" with some ingame item to show it....it would be an interesting option, that kind of engagement thou requires dedication and commitent..so it catters to certain players.
---
But also Albion has the quick-PvP fix, arenas, 5v5 matches that have ingame money reward but also a cost (the items you use wear out and you need to repair them). 
---
The same concept in eve would be awesome, people fighting and destroying their ships in arranged matches, earning perhaps an alliance-sponsored type of currency that can be exchanged later?.  Even outsiders "betting" on the winner/loser and also creating an additional ISK sink with taxes applied there.
---
The tournament itself was just the playground of a few elite, with their rich sponsors behind, and people stared at it......it didnt have any meaning in day to day eve.
---
I like what you say, and i agree with most of the points, i just see there are missing opportunities for not allowing "eve" to evolve as the market has..... people have said "arranged fights" are not true eve nature....people have said "eve is for empire building", but then later whine how time consuming logistics and everyother task required for goal is just nonsense.
---
Eve needs to evolve, it needs to have the entire gradient of fights
---
Quick PvP
---
Medium commitment PvP (i think FW fits nicely here...no sov, limited logistics, isk/loyalty goals)
---
High commitmnet PvP (Wormholes)
---
Endgame PvP (current nullsec sov).
---
And each of those gameplay ecosystems need to interact with the other in the market.
---
No super / titan / fax
---
CCP sadly didnt invest much in eve and won't doing it in the future, the recent changes show it. Its a low cost investment without innovation or invention. I still don't get how CCP Falcon, Hilmar and all the other Dev's who read the threads, do their job, play the game don't see the issues eve have and try to improve/invent and invest. Your side Project's failed, now you do Mobile Stuff and invest a lot in it CCP but this will fail too. When you don't cramp up your shit to your main cashcow the cow will probably go into starvation.

Oops... I didn't realize this comment was in this thread. This thread is mine and the one I referenced in my last post.

you need to be in a fleet and in squad/wing/fleet command positions to tag
---
Ya know, a solution to the PVP and overview/tactical zoom-out, would be having a recreated battle/replay or alternate view. So, if you were streaming or recording, you could output the combat with zoom-ins and tracking, but on your screen you are actually zoomed out and watching boxes and clicking your overview.
---
It would make the game more streamable, especially if these replays could be interactive and just on a delay. Otherwise, the streamer would have to setup things as to what is tracked/shown on the output.
---
I used to play Paintball semi-pro/amateur in tournaments. Back then, ESPN was trying to find a way to televise it. The problem? You can't see the paintballs easily and there is no focal point. When you show the whole field, the paintballs are a blur. When you zoom in on one player... something happens that's more interesting on the other side of the field. This is why focal-point FPS/multi-view screens are better (with smaller teams) and single-ball sports which use the ball as a focal point. They also have replay and picture-in-picture, slow-mo, etc.
---
well like online video games to me break out like this:
---
PVP vs. PVE
---
Then PVP has small scale, giant battles, etc. etc.
---
PVE has all the other various things
---
SO 80% PVE 20% PVP  was what I was thinking, but looking into getting a hecate once i've saved up some money
---
Sec status actually gives you some understanding of what is going on in the system and who are those people in local. Yeah you kinda can grind your sec status back to trick unsuspecting crabs, but thats taking some kind of effort and drives low sec economy so thats ok. Yep you still can get ganked in ls even by 5.0 pilots but you gotta stay vigilant anyways. Plus low secstatus makes gate camping riskier because you actually can be attacked with no consequence by any passerby.  
---
Yeah and watching for blinkies helps avoid getting killed.

command dessy with defender missiles helps too, they don't even need a whole fleet. counters exist, people are just lazy/greedy and have tiny brains. why use that command dessy on the off chance you get bombed when you can have +1 covetor on grid?

At least the Voyager probe does. Very old-tech, that one.

what if I told you it was meant as a joke because Theta and Horde standing comms are absolute cancer and it's like herding cats with down syndrom in order to protect them and so I was insinuating devs should be exposed to the tortute that is these two nullsec protective services groups as a comedic exercise? or was that too much and my humor wooshed too hard over everyone?
---
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with CONCORD in Jita. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Panaja Paukonsuo. From what I can gather, she commands CONCORD from a Marshall-class battleship just outside of the Caldari Navy Assembly Plant. She's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defense, take this beast out, and break their grip on The Forge.

I can’t believe how dumb you are.

yeah no dude you're just dumb.
---
the mutaplasmid isn't the expensive part of the equation, it's the module. if you're only risking the mutaplasmid you're removing the significant risk

For example, a Tobias web can be 40bn+ ISK, a mutaplasmid to mutate it is like 200mil.

You're right about other games pulling your attention.  There are so many I have on a backlog to play/finish.  Octopath Traveller, Vampyr, Breath of the Wild, No Man's Sky, Fornite, and more.  And many of the super engaging ones are fast-paced without losing anything.  Pick up and out down a game in 30 minutes, whereas in eve it takes a long time to even get into a ship of choice.
---
SP month was great.  Keep on with it ccp
---
I was like oh god what in the fuck is going on in this post. Then I looked at the OP. God Bless Jesus.
---
You enjoy structure grinding, says plenty about why people universally call you retarded. Some players, that actually have two brain cells to rub together, realize that it's shit gameplay and unenagaging. But I get it, it's all that little pea in your head can manage, it's not your fault.
---
Well, my post was bad sarcastically but i guess if i was to create a "eve classic" I'd do:
---
Caps cant use gates
---
Citadels on low power are one timer, no tether
---
No asset safety 
---
Blackout stays
---
Supers/Titans all have mat costs like vanquisher/vendetta
---
Revert jump fatigue changes
---
No HAW guns
---
No moon mining in high sec
---
People could move current characters over but not isk or ships.
---
100 isk cost = test server.
---
In other words, we are not supposed to EVER build one! lol
---
&gt; Yeah not many serious JF pilots were bitching about covops cynos.
---
Were any? were literally ANY serious JF pilots bitching about the incredible buff to safety that allowing us to jump to blops cynos would be?
---
thanks =) i have been talking to some of the other cva dudes about this and we really think it will help alot
---
yeah it's almost like different people, have different opinions
---
&gt; If every time I lit cyno in a 30-40m bomber on one of the stations in these systems I was gonna get blapped by some dick in a tornado, I would be pretty annoyed.
---
Sounds like you're absolute trash tbh. Light it at a safe in a recon with a ton of ECCM running, and a few webs. Web your JF into warp the moment it lands. The chances of anyone landing a 100% probe hit on you before your JF is in warp are 0, before your cyno is down and you're cloaked/warping off in the recon are also ridiculously slim. 
---
But I mean, if you want to light it on station in a bomber, obviously you don't care about throwing isk away.
---
gottem
---
Yeah, I get that I can pop open a web browser, it's just good UI/UX to have that ability in app. Tie in something like Google pay or something and oof the app could easily turn into a wallet drainer. It's just one of those things that would make sense from a business standpoint. Why have barriers between people and their money?
---
Yeah I can drag up from the bottom too. It's just one of those minor annoyances thing that make the app less pleasant to use. It's all about that refined UX.
---
Aw deleted your other comment calling me a “bittervet”?
---
These catch up mechanics aren’t good for the game and are bad for new players. Once the catch up mechanics run out for you you’ll feel lost and slowed down.
---
are you saying if your friend was running for a position and shared the same opinion as you and promotes legislation that doesn't shit on your family unlike the other guy you wouldn't vote for him/her?
---
Haha, you should have seen how hideous it was for the noob before injectors .
---
&gt; In terms of loosing a JF it's not, most people here don't know what they are talking about,
---
Found the guy who has no clue what he's talking about. Covert cynos in deepsafes are far, far safer for travelling through regularly camped lowsec systems, than industrial cynos are.
---
Appreciate it, and no I didn't. I just didn't appreciate r/eve being attacked for disagreeing with your point when it was (to me at least) very clear why your idea wasn't going to work.
---
Sorry if I offended you, but also you did tar everyone with the same brush just because they disagreed with you which isn't cool either.
---
arranged matches or "arenas" would be nice as a quick PvP fix, FW is a sort of midtier, you need leadership and at least some time commitment to hold systems and deploy counter fleets.
---
Well, it's a fairly common pattern on r/eve for people who make simple suggestions to receive personal attacks for their trouble. This isn't that friendly of a community.
---
Pretty sure the 128848th amendment to the New Eden constitution says that the right to cloak shall not be infringed upon!
---
Fair point, but on the flip side, if you come at that same community with guns blazing you're going to get shot back at.
---
Cat girls?
---
There is an amazing Android app that does just this: Eve PI.
---
Highly recommend!
---
🤨
---
I like.
---
This is absolutely one of the core issues. I was a director for over a year and when I left no one wanted to take over. Honestly I think a lot of it is that the overall attitude of players has gotten worse over the years.
---
Social media and killboards mean leadership and members have to deal with in game failures outside of game far more than they used to. It certainly discourages people from trying to step up. Plus there's now a whole suite of IT services that are expected to be provided now. When I first started it was just TeamSpeak and maybe a shitty forum.
---
Game mechanics have obviously contributed to the stagnation, but I think leadership burnout is also a major factor. I don't have any good ideas for fixing it unfortunately.
---
" note: this means that Jump Freighters will not be able to jump to covert cynos as we originally planned. This is an alternative solution, not an additional one. "
---
Jesus... I just spent the last week training multiple characters towards that.
---
you can still cloak! just with reasonable limits on how long
---
I already know my path , and yes I did delete it because it was rude on my part.
---
Catch up mechanics are to the benefit of the new player, making them wait like you did 12 years ago is a bad decision.  
---
But hey, you have very strong opinions about this, so whatever I say won't matter to you because you think only your way is correct.
---
Good troll post, i was reading until it got into the parts about Trump and the US
---
well played
---
:/ sounds like you're an american that has a hard time being honest about the state of your country. take a step back and look at what it all means.
---
ESI exposes this already
---
CCP seems to have buffed resource generation to hell. Have they done anything to balance production? If capitals are too numerous and spent on trivial engagements then I propose the following: 1) massively increase capital production and 2) make rapid re-deployment of capitals a no-go. Sure you can respond with ‘fuck you’ force and hot drop a small gang with a dozen capitals. But if a serious incursions happens somewhere else at the same time, those capitals that hot dropped the small gang won’t be making it there right away.
---
I also saw someone else complaining about Cyno changes killing capital on capital fights. Can people not push into sov and force capital fights? Or does that go against the big blue donut? Can’t have your cake and eat it too.
---
Man you are really triggered right now, like unusually so... sorry for liking other gameplay styles? Dropping bombers on ratters is too easy, running around in a pvp ship and killing ratters is too easy... I prefer studying enemies, setting up traps, establishing narratives that hurt enemy moral, dread bombing supers, creative pvp strategies people don't normally utilize, guerilla warfare, creating trap and bait scenarios for targets, hunting hunters, and burning down a region after the hard work is said and done - kinda the cruise control R&amp;R after a long day.
---
I'm sorry your EVE experience only consists of "right click - jump through portal" or "right click - orbit ratter / miner" lmao.
---
Man that's pretty pathetic.
---
Unless you’re mining in a procurer or skiff, your miner will get ganked in hi sec at some point. AFK mining in hi sec is almost just as dangerous as at keyboard mining in WHs. I get the mining, but the ink/hr isn’t very good and with the hi sec ganking I don’t find it enjoyable or relaxing much anymore.
---
I remember eve-classic as being a massive log-off fest with near-live updated "pilots in space" maps, unscannable deep safes and constant making of +15km gate bookmarks.
---
Of course if two fleets did decide to fight it was Ravens at a hundred ks supported by jammers and people rarely seemed to die. Also without dictors or anchorable bubbles it was near impossible to catch and keep an opposition fleet about even if it committed at first. 
---
These are not the classic memories you are looking for. Move along.
---
Sniff sniff that spod right into your brain.
---
very thoughtful response  🙄

lol. I'm never not going to read it like that now.
---
Good luck
---
Those are three pretty different sets of skills that basically require three different ships. At best I would say get a Sisters of EvE ship and you can do combat and exploration in it. I would kind of focus on one for a bit.
---
Haha I Get It! It's Like The Cruisers Are The Parents And The Frigate Is The Kid xD
---
Ccp made Rorquals ruin this game, fixed it for you, and na I'm winning eve already
---
Not to worry, new guy. You'll be dead long before the minute and a half is up.
---
I mean I try not to speak in absolutes in scenarios where I can’t possibly know but I don’t know a single JF pilot who was upset about that at all.
---
They all assumed this was the “bone” CCP was throwing us for deep dicking everything else.
---
*yo*
---
**chill lmao**
---
reddit is discovering the same thing with putting an absolute nutter on the csm as a funny joke that we discovered with xenuria.  first, the joke is on ccp, and then rapidly the joke is on you as well.
---
If you can’t outmaneuver fatiguing supercap umbrellas with the most powerful whaling tools that have ever existed in the game, the problem isn’t supercap umbrellas, it’s you.
---
CCP failed to revive
---
That's what Jita is for.

They don’t even need to rollback. They have that fancy new look for 4-4 on SiSi.
---
I hardly think a single side comment, no matter how snide, is "coming at the community guns blazing". Plenty of people make such snide comments, and it is not as though I'm making a long rambling post about how "toxic" the community is or isn't.
---
Can anyone tell me what the song at the start is?
---
Hey now, stop trying to bring actual experience to this discussion.  We know from r/Eve that the best ideas are the ones that come from people who have no idea how things are actually done.
---
yes bro. but that's a destroyer
---
Gr8 b8 m8. I r8 8/8.
---
This I did not know. Thxs!
