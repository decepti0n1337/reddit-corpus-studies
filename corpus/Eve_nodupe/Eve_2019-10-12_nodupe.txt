I cringed at 1600mm-plates on a Cap. Then I saw one isnt even T2 but Meta4... Ho-Lee-Chit... That... I... You know... Dunno what to say... O,o

That is a really good suggestion! It shouldn't be difficult to build, I'll work on this
---
yep reason i left null and went to low not to mention i was mostly only out there for pvp and lets be honest that dont happen with out a 100 jumps and then you get dropped on my 30 caps
---
Hi Michael, I too am an evecoholic
---
Surely that will fix the game
---
Not really the stations are Corp owned just like citidels only diff is what type of Corp owns them. Npc or players.
---
I could agree with you in Npc null where pirates hold sov unless the Corp has positive standing with the locals.
---
Lowsec is usually still controlled by the empires in most cases..
---
Then don't?

They still haven't figured out the proteus was nerfed

Willing to bet he doesn't listen and tries anyways. No armor/drone skills, but can fly a Loki 👌

Fountain for free fountain big gulps of content
---
I'd use nullified just to move around but you could also use it during pvp. Contrary to popular belief I think HAMS are actually good if your application skills are up there. Use some crash as well. I think a decent fit will get you 800-900 DPS.
---
Damn, nice one guys.
---
sell assets hold liquid then?

Discord-based seems like an odd criterion. I’m curious now. Why is that important?

there was hellfire I module afaik they were first named smartbombs doing thermal damage.

I mean they really dont. If you are talking about 1 vs 1 then maybe. But 1 carrier against 10 will get defanged in a matter of minutes.
---

What carrier changes?

Welcome back!

Either you’re just bad at shitposting/baiting, or an actual brainlet

Also hemorrhaging talent to Riot

&gt;Expectation is some people are still salty about chaos Era and quit till its over or other people are downsizing there 10000 man rorq fleet.
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
By almost you mean twice as much?:)
---
Not arguing against it but bhaals are due to goons. The others are more expensive. If thats still an issue then drop rates should be tampered with. But just killing a playstyle isnt good imo.
---
I doubt you go nulli cloaky when u do sites. I dont think Ive ever seen one and they can be combat probed. Or your ship atleast.
---
If those are core skills it would be a 9 month headstart - worth the effort of escalating to CCP
---
When you see Gideon + Gnosis... you know good content is about to happen.
---
because it;s a game, not real life
---
Clearly a lot of decisions about EVE's design are based around economic realism. If it's "just a game" you can just go play some space-action shooter and not spreadsheets in space.
---
I'm trying to understand what about bots makes players so angry. Like I said, I've been out of the loop for about 10 years. Is it literally just order book chasing?
---
7o.
---
They want to hang out socially on a VOIP during playtime
---
Interesting concept. Judging by your post you seem to think of it as an offensive weapon for wormholers, but I can also see it as a defensive early-warning system.
---
It doesn't look like it would be overly difficult to extend this to filter on system/constellation/region basis, so it could be used to warn people of new connections into their areas of operation. Could even be integrated it into intel tools like Near2 for instant-alerts.
---
It's a game, meant for players to play. If you're letting a bot play the game for you, then it kinda takes away the point. And it makes it harder for the other players since they can't bid faster than your bots. It's annoying as shit to see that a bot is playing the 0.01 games with you ***the instant*** your order is posted.
---
&gt;I'm trying to understand what about bots makes players so angry.
---
bots in and of themselves aren't necessarily an issue in sandbox pvp games, it is though in eve because of CCP's inability to properly balance risk/reward.
---
People dislike bots because they give players an unfair advantage, being able to profit without playing is cheesey and gimmicky and not in the spirit of eve online.
---
Order book chasing is honestly one of the most basic type of trading bots. If you really need an order filled _right away_ you should be making market orders. Those bots exist because of the profitability of the spread, and it is a job to maintain that spread. You could split the spread in half with a limit order, and if the bots are dumb enough to chase you there, you can use that to buy/sell at a discount.
---
What's stopping you?
---
You *really* don't want answers. You just want to justify why we should accept your reasoning that market bots are fine.
---
Fixing FW is not on the Roadmap. Roadmap.... hello???
---
That's cause people have a harder time empathizing with a$$holes (even if you may not have been such when the hamster died RIP - I hope you are not a liar as well and there was a hamster...)
---
Somebody post the checklist
---
The show is basically McGirk broadcasting for reps and everyone is just waiting for him to start choking on his own vomit so they can point and laugh.
---
FYI there are no magical people who pilot spaceships with their minds in real life either but here we are putting up with that shit anyway
---
People leaving because of local.
---
&gt;That being said..dps Fighters aren't the problem..neither is application.. It's all Support fighters
---
See you say this, but I've seen plenty of posts saying a fighter damage/application need nerfing. It seems everyone has their favourite point to bitch about, and it won't stop until a Loki can solo a Chimera. 
---
I also disagree with the tackle point. A carrier's specialty is targeting. The only siege module it has turns it into a coffin in order to increase targeting. It's designed to be able to target and engage from vast distances. Being able to tackle makes sense, since you can chose to fuck off before fighters get close in 90% of cases.
---
In my personal opinion, a carrier should be the primary threat to small subcaps on a fight due to its application, since it cannot come close to a dread/Super/Titan DPS against larger targets. HAW dreads are the current kings I think, which I don't really agree with. Supers may need some tweaking, as they're absolute monsters, but regular carriers aren't overpowered at all. A Leshak does more DPS and (depending on pilot skill) can solo a carrier.
---
Carrier and supercarrier are very different ships. 
---
The carrier is absolutely not the single largest problem eve has. 
---
Additionally what's your issue with Rorqs? They take ages to pay for themselves, and are massive content generations. Ease of scalability is the only concrete issue. And no I don't have 12 of them, I bought one in the blackout cause it was cheap, and don't even have excavators.
---
Cringe
---
he can lose freighters every day for a year and still be isk positive
---
you on the other hand, are just mad
---
&gt; This was staged on sisi!!!111 /s
---
Sadly thats not possible as the sotiyos don't spawn there.
---
&gt; Sad this play style got killed.
---
its still alive and well ;) https://zkillboard.com/kill/79343718/
---
Considering an insured freighter is approximately 300m isk to lose it'd still be worth it to deny the loot if you're feeling petty
---
Great contribution to the discussion. I am super glad you took the time to think of something important to say
---
you can solo level 4 security missions,dont need nestors
---
Tastes differ.
---
Well, you're dual tanked with 3 weapon systems and no damage mods...
---
Players WANTED all these toys though. Players were crying out for alliances and would have gotten moist at the concept of having their own sov/citadels etc back in the day.   
---
You can't "fix" EVE by saying "don't play this way". Some changes help, fatigue made a big difference TBH. But people want to make their own empires and there isn't any reason for CCP to stop that. Not sure what the issue for small PVP corps is, in Horde I regularly see smaller groups come out and kite and brawl with standing fleet in various locations. Larger fights can be pretty entertaining too. Back in 2005/2006 i got bored of null as it was just gatecamps and blueballs for large fights even if the odds were even, simply due to server issues or FCs not being able to commit/lose sizable chunks of a fleet.   
---
But yeah, this idea that CCP needs to force the blocs apart and disband alliances is stupid. Players form groups, they will find ways around anything. I would rather see some slow changes to anoms or so (which have been happening). But it is a fine line for CCP to try and balance. TBH Lowsec needs more love, as that seems to be the ideal area for smaller scale PVP.
---
Local, bookmarks and d-Scan should all be part of a new redesigned overview. But since ccp is focusing on new players instead of fixing 10 year old bad design choices it won’t happen any time soon.
---
Don't be silly if the content is hard and needs resources to do and it takes effort and organisation and then the results of that can be taken away with ease then it destroys that content.    It is absolutely right to have done something like this so that people do this content and use those big powerful ships for something interesting.    Vily was absolutely right to push for this as being better for the game.   Accept that this is high end content for end game players, done dusted move on.
---
I have to say, this is absolutely one of my favorite parts of this game.  I was actually thinking about cross-posting that vigil invite to others outside our community.  I would love for others to see how a competitive community can act with civility in times of need.
---
I am taking a break atm, but I have participated in many vigils in which I never knew the person.  It's incredible to me how simple the action is, yet it is a profoundly important statement to those who are now missing their comrade or loved one.
---
The best part is no matter what side of a war you are on, I have rarely if ever seen vigil ships get shot on their way to or back from a vigil ceremony, even being held in enemy territory.  Even better, nobody takes advantage of these times and drops fleets.
---
It just goes to show EvE is not as salt filled as most people think.
---
He was voted onto the csm!! obviously a smart man
---
All this talk of betrayal and hate coming from the guy who's corp leader sold keepstars to test without asking the owners then proceeded to moon walk away from eve.
---
Yeah I now. I mean speed is still a thing where 2 Nestors are better than any solo ship, but I am posting this to find out what else I could do with my 2 beauties.
---
bro he is in TAPI alliance - if he wasn't so good explain why TAPI can be bluer than papa smurfs left toe
---
yeah of course! :) bring the finns back!
---
you uncloaked well before it died and they still call you a scripter/botter? 
---
if they want this not to happen they only have to park some cloacked sabres around the NPC structure and then bubble the fuck out of it just before it dies
---
Gooniverse 2019
---
Those tears tho.
---
Some of the best people I have ever met were in this game. There is no other community like it. You might might meet one asshole here or there, but most of the time, even people that get the best of you will offer some sort of input to help you out for next time.
---
I've witnessed people that were mortal enemies in game drop the shtick for a moment to pay their respects for a fallen soldier irl. Class acts. It's a hard pill to swallow knowing someone you had good fights with will never fly again. :(
---
If the pirate career is too broad for you, I can help and specify a bit more. So you can switch to [Suicide Ganker](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Careers_101).
---
TIL: fixing some silly mechanic abused by 1 person and hated by everyone else is an abuse of CSM power.
---
Disable the option after you warped to it. So you can only sell untouched escalations
---
I think it was an AA meeting.
---
Didn't get enough follows on his Twitter.
---
I like it. Keep drinking
---
Yeah, some of the skills were “irrelevant” to me at my stage in the game so it was nice to be able to have a fresh start with triple the skills. I followed a goon 30 or 60 day skill guide and cherry picked what I “thought” were good for me
---
I wish I stll had eve in me. I just dont. I play flight sims and enjoy handcrafting nowdays.
---
Your confusing fc requests with you yelling at people calling them gay
---
At the base level you are correct, it was setup as a way to end the war, but  in many cases the defender is not able to do this, so intent yes, but in actual effect not really.   When I was in the war dec discord I wanted something that even a noob corp could blow up, but that was me.
---
I know that the structure itself is irrelevant, but the war dec fee of 100m does start to add up.
---
Nothing changed in terms of war deckers until players started to group up and carry out events like these.
---
Putting a cap on wars could have been the way to do it, but I happen to believe that it is better if players do this type of thing and that Fortizar being blown up was a consequence even if PIRAT knew that they would lose it.
---
I want to actually make a post here aswell and explain why i personally am very unhappy with the changes to sotiyo loot . before you call me a cry baby and tell me to adapt yadyada please read what i have to say.  
---
the main argument made by /u/vily and /u/progodlegend was that the new mechanic allows for escalation and combat for what pgl called "elite pvp" .  
---
i want to say that , before the patch the way to outloot chor/cable was to use a rorqual which would 10/10 times allways loot faster than he ever could in his dst. i will not go into all  the details how to set it up cause its waste of everbodys time but im sure chori can confirm this if anybody is interested. NOW , assuming we still had the 40k crates , TEST and other slowbrainers could use their rorqs to loot faster than chori , forcing him to either let you have the loot , OR drop dreads on your rorqual which leads to the escalation and pgls so wished for "elite pvp".  
---
BUT , and this is why i personally am very sad about this is , instead of using their brains and some smart gameplay and getting the same results they are getting right now , it is the CSM that is beeing abused to alter game mechanics in favour for lazy/incapable players who dont want to sit down and use their 2 braincells on how to beat chori.  
---
the fact that the CSM gets abused like this is a wide known fact , but it doesnt lessen my bitterness about the way things are going.  
---
idk   
---
i guess u can call me a scrub and crybaby now.
---
ps : ill steal ur loot fgts
---
The Nosferatu is there to fill a slot as well, and to use in case of anything getting really close. If you can't fit it, it's not mandatory.
---
Drones work wonders with the Arbitrator.  Also stick to only one type of tanking. You got shield resists, but no shield regen (passive/active). Once your shield are gone they are useless.
---
Garmon (2014 AT AlaaaaaaaaaHHHHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhh) was the worst or the best according to your point of view lol.
---
Use a different ship. Honestly like someone else said already. If you have to ask this question you're not ready to fly a loki. Not only will you lose skill points if you die, a good loki fit also tends to be rather expensive.
---
Also train drones. I don't care what ships you're flying, most have a drone bay, and drones add a decent amount of DPS to any ship and should not be ignored.
---
The other important thing with solo cloaky pvp is that you need to know what you can and can't kill in that ship. The most important aspect of cloaky ships isn't that people don't know that you're there, because outside of WH's people have local to know that you're there, and anyone smart is probably already checked your zkill to see what ships fits you tend to fly. The advantage is with a cloaky ship you get to determine if you want to take the fight or not. And for that you need to have pvp experience that you obviously don't yet have.
---
So just do yourself a favor, before you start flying expensive lokis, train up your drones skills and practice in stratioses (or is it stratii?).
---
Eat a dick, I like 16 boxing procs and “stealing” the moon ore in hisec.
---
Don't burn straight towards enemy ships, burn 90 degrees to the side to keep up transversal.
---
And that is retarded.
---
Willem Crane was a notorious welp artist when I was in Horde. He’s gotta be in the discussion.
---
ah
---
i mean did u read my post ?
---
why can't you drop on the freighter?
---
How exactly does using freighters lead to fights? They instantly die to the smallest of dread drops so at best you're getting &lt;1b of naglfar kills in exchange for the loot.
---
Well, fill us in dude.
---
&gt;It is simultaneously the greatest source of safety (because you can curate down to 0 or 1 connections) and the greatest threat to safety (because you can roll 15 holes much faster than you can scan 15 jumps down a chain).
---
I suspected it would be something dishonest like this. If something causes 12t in loot, which was actually more than the bounty prizes in null, anybody should rightfully assume the safety part of this is what matters and pretty much disregard everything else.
---
&gt;Things that could be done less intrusively, off the top of my head:
---
Players have demonstrated that if they are in control, safety follows. The game must therefore control hole spawning. Mass can act as a "filter", but should not allow for "rolling". Risk and isk need to be balanced.
---
Shoot me a PM, I'd be down to go fly with ya once ina while.
---
&gt; We also need to do something that makes fighting happen for longer, it's far to easy to leave a fight.
---
Can't warp with an active weapons timer?
---
You can - but it won't lead to any sort of fight. You can frag it with a single dread - so if that's what everyone's looking forward to killing then it's a success.
---

Biting the hand that feeds you is bad, so good luck with your adventures
---
How would you suggest I do that? The vid is intentionally vague. One can make guesses, but that's about it.
---
&gt; So you admit then that you were ordered to clear Cache for purposes of  retreat; you were not ordered to occupy the sov necessarily, but have  now set down roots so you can entrench yourselves in there. 
---
We were ordered to take Cache, Clean it up, set a keepstar for a Titan highway for WC.  
---
&gt; Why would WinterCo. care to do this? Cache is a fallback position  towards Outer Passage. There is no point to settling down in Cahce or  killing canerous medium structures. You are deluded. 
---
Because WC was starting to settle down in Cache, and in agreements with N, Defense fleets were formed to assist with stopping Legacy putting structures down in Cache. Makes sense to stop stupid fleet warps that many seem to fall for.
---
&gt; helping the evacuations mainly. 
---
Riiiiight. I mean if you were the Vulpines, I could agree with this. But that's hard to believe when we see over 150 ppl in E5T asking us to pop moons for them when a Legacy Fleet is anchoring an astrahus in front of the keepstar you are using to bail out from.
---
Spin it how you want.
---
But, given the recent logistics and deals with N and WC. We can tell you're simply lashing out because you have 0 understanding of what is actually going on. And rather than to get real information, you simply argue every point to try and spin your silly speculations in your favor.
---
You're in Orgin... You know as soon as your content dries up a little, you guys are just going to leave and go where more content is.
---
Sure would I be able to do them solo. But that’s not what I was asking for ;)
---
I mean you're the guy who said it was broken this just looks like a dude looting a wreck.
---
Yeah the nos aren't really gonna be used, just there in case something did get close.  I just though it pretty useless having more drone links as you will have greater drone range than lock range.  Weapons will have no bonuses on this hull and add very little dps while draining cap.  Add a tractor beam if you want loot.
---
you are crying as hard as carrier ratters during the 260m ticks nerf, grow up
---
It doesn't take long to get them to 8/10 ME TE. And if you buy losts of them you won't have enough manufacturing slots for all of them so you as well might research them.
---
No reason not to research the ones not currently in use.
---
Hey Wormholer. I spent 5 hours a day pressing 'orbit' on a Smugglers gate in my Vexor Navy Issue for 6 weeks to buy my Super Carrier. Therefore it deserves to be overpowered and win against players with the same thought and actions inputted as my VNI in the Haven. No, I don't use hotkeys, Yes, I use EM Fighters against Minmatar T2 Armor Tanks, Yes, I use my Heavy Fighter bomb ability to clear our own bubbles off tackled ships so they can warp out. And when I over-extend and actually start losing my Super to a 4 man destroyer gang, I just press cyno. 
---
You just want to solo supers in your exploration buzzard ITS A CAPITAL SHIP. Oh sorry, that was the wrong copy/paste response for this thread. You'll have to forgive me wormholer as you know I don't like to press many keys on my keyboard :)))

It was too much to type out the entire name?

But maybe I don't log in enough I suppose.

I don't know what sort of anger you have in you or what issues, but I would ask you kindly to please make an attempt to not use the term "pay the ultimate price" in a video game. It's a free internet and you can say whatever but it's just an honest request from a stranger. 
---
Thanks.
---
&gt;No:
---
Then you will continue to not be able to do that.
---
he got voted into the csm cause he was on the legacy ballot, him having any skills or not is 100% irrelevant and unrelated to the election(see dunk)
---
Why shouldn't
---
I have time to waste. Tell me the rorq strat.
---
Welcome to balance, where you can't exploit a mechanic and bitch to keep it around. Do you like it?
---
who gave you reddit post privilege?
---
Good for you. I don't always look down on retards.
---
To be fair the mechanic was incredibly dumb when you needed a ceptor, dumb when you needed a DST, and dumber now you need a freighter. 
---
With a proper fit and good reaction time it's really not possible to actually probe and warp enough scram strength in time to catch the DST before it warps/MJDs off into yonder. Then, if everyone is actually on the ball (unlike this video) it's just a coinflip on whose loot call goes through to London first. 
---
It's almost as if they should have sat down and rethought the sotiyo mechanics instead of just changing volumes....
---
The TAPI whining was pretty funny though
---
How is it an exploit? Literally anyone can do this.
---
I want to add that the mining industry is profitable indeed, that yes for sure you can grind for Plex, but not at the beginning as your skills would be at the bottom your profit/h isn't going to be enough. On top of that, that's the only occupation where it isn't interesting in term of ships availability when in alpha.
---
It's a double-edged sword, my friend. You can't create tech to give you an advantage, while at the same time complain that they are using the same tech to gain an advantage for themselves.
---
ehhh recruit newby tell em he has to scan 1000 wh and do 100 courier contracts before becoming a full member...problem solved and of course rince and repeat
---
Is this CCP's way of crowdsourcing?
---
The usual fitting formatting is borrowed from EFT, a 3rd party fitting tool. The EVE Online fitting window can import and export fits based on this format; see the hamburgermenu "import &amp; export" in the lower left (browser tab open)
---
This is honestly a great idea to invite PVP, add it to low and hisec too! Implementation might be a little harder however due to the citadel spam now but with the rewards more people will attack them and they'll slowly get cleared out. To make this even more efficient make it so Industrial structures can only be anchored on celestials. This also limits space more to fight over. Wormholes I can see allowing 1 of each per wormhole to force people to fight for wormholes they want too or just anchoring Industrials on moons to base. Makes even wormholes have to fight for the best space instead of 6 astras in a WH.
---
Makes sense. Why not Mumble, Vent, or TeamSpeak? To me the choice of tech is less important than the goals and attitude of the corp.
---
Grid control: None
---
Combat Probe: AFK Netflix
---
Time Uncloaked: More than 20 Sec
---
And they call you a cheater... 
---
 That just show how bad they are with MMO in general....
---
Do we know how long CCP has been aware of this issue?
---
As long as they disagree, of course they won't change anything.
---
How do you think the sausage is made?
---
What about fax repping the freighter? 
---
I don't know if anyone is willing to jump more than a couple of dreads to actually provoke a fight, but that might happen?
---
That's great. He tried, and the nerf arguably worked as he got caught.
---
This dude is shit on so many levels, loved to fly with him tho
---
Supply wasn't as high, and you couldn't piecemeal them the way you can with injectors. The character bazaar has nothing like the impact on the game that injectors do.
---
That irrelevant particular individual made csm cry to ccp and let tapi scream even more retarded as they already do. Doesnt really count as irrelevant to me.
---
Bots were basically pushing up the price. There is also the cyno chance, but people claim its business as usual, so it may not affect the price much.
---
Titan chars were quite expensive on the bazaar IIRC and there was a much more limited supply of them.
---
I'm really not sure what the whining about this change is for.  If you want the loot, fight for it.  Form up and drop on the freighter.  Gameplay based on who's server tick goes to london faster is silly.
---
Any awesome person want to provide a transcript of the relevant bits for those of us who can't listen? Thank you thank you in advance!
---
most people consider them irrelevant, basically they only serve as a function which takes your ship's ehp, concord response time and the total value of your fit/cargo as variables, and determines the risk of your ship exploding in hs as you go past certain thresholds. this in turn introduces some checks to the ecosystem.
---
for the most criminal activity possible in game, you could say it plays out in a quite orderly and systematic manner.
---
aside from that i have mixed feelings about globby's shitposting around here
---
and yet somehow you're like 30% of the total comments in this post, while not paying attention to this particular irrelevant individual
---
really gets the noggin joggin
---
I'm more surprised he didn't get shot by goons.
---
You still haven't provided a source on this being solely on vily despite the csm minutes disagreeing with your lie.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/dgjl2c/our_place_in_the_food_chain/
---
fun fact: this "effort" is being "orchestrated" by a guy called Doctor Per, whose sole EVE activity consisted of camping jita 4-4 undock in a blap loki with blanket decs up on all major NS alliances etc. – until PIRAT kicked him off the undock. he's still salty about that, and you can bet that if he ever accomplishes his dream of defeating PIRAT, he will be getting right back to it.
---
in all honesty Zkill is overvaluing the hull by a little bit, I'd say that kill is in realty worth like \~54b
---
I said fully fitted, I did not say: properly fitted.
---
I'm not OP - I have no idea. Maybe "discord" is like "coke" is for soda to some people
---
I am so confused by all of this, these are some of the worst ship fittings I've ever seen and they're *capital* ships
---
Very good on you for putting them out of their misery and letting the world mock them for their insane stupidity but also like how is anyone allowed to create ship fits like this???
---
This character was created 2016/11/30 21:19

Pretty sure he could have directly trained into a titan in almost three years, assuming this is a dedicated capital/titan pilot.

Forget ninja harvesting. Cytoserocin has been more expensive for a long time now https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/ore/gas.php

Most of these sotiyos are spawning deep into someone's super umbrella or into their bloc's control. There is no fighting here. If there is any escalation the super umbrella will appear and helldunk you.

What is really stupid is that one of the biggest ninjalooters of these is in test, so this change is hurting test more than anyone.
---
&gt;I would love to see proof of a lesh murdering a properly fit carrier I would enjoy laughing at that carriers stupidity. Because a lesh can't deal half asuch as a carrier can its hilarious to think you would lose one to it. A fleet sure but a single 1v1 that's hilarious and your a crazy person. Proof please.

[What about an Ikitursa?](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78598746/)

[Or wait how about soloed by a Loki?](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76734488/)
---
Neither of these fits are particularly bad they did at least put on some core defense field extenders and had a damage control along with at least a decent amount of shield mods.
---
You can defang a carrier pretty easily fighters don't really have much HP at all.  Most people I see in normal carriers not supers are using T1 fighters which at max skills are about 3,200 HP and the tech 2s are about 3,600 HP.  Support fighters have more they're about 6,200 EHP but there are only 3 of them to a squad vs 9 in the DPS squads.
---
Carriers also cannot fit scrams or webs to the ship themselves because the NSA module increases the activation cost of all EWAR by 9,999,900%.  You also can only have one support squad out at a time so if the carrier has webbing fighters out there is nothing keeping you on grid and you can just warp out and back again.
---
Yeah, I'm thinking about actually writing down a schedule. I've sleazy found that an hour easily spans into two... or so.
---
like i said, i don't have an opinion on bosons because i don't get bosoned and don't see it as an issue
---
that's not deserved.  I flew in some of his fleets; he was a good fc.
---
I love Reddit!
---
Cloud huffing is a big time investment to train for a new player, even barring the ISK cost, and unless you live in a wormhole it's hard to make money efficiently.
---
I have the Amarr on hanging in my game room!
---
I don't remember: how easy are the rats there to handle? Wouldn't you need to clear those first? They had some nice lootdrops.
---
So a corp that provides funny content for the rest of us, nice

Yeah, you have to come from black ancestors in order to be black, how surprising!
---
If you hold the q key you can select a range and direction to pilot to so you don't keep going forever.
---
Why is it only minmatar.. game makers purposely made it so you have to play minmatar
---
Economy noob here, how is that true? Surely more isk is destroyed than looted after the kill, right?
---
I really, really miss the old Dino turkey holding a briefcase.
---
I'm glad you did.   I would have missed it otherwise.
---
I refer the honourable gentleman to the answer I gave elsewhere in this thread.
---
Yeah totally missed the other dude's posting, you can't hide stuff in paragraphs it is gonna get lost.
---
On the mobile app if you go to the subreddit list page, click the ... menu on the top right and select "change user flair."
---
On PC you should see an (edit) button next to your name on the sidebar below Subreddit info.
---
Reading?  Nobody got time for that.
---
Okay thank you
---
And one of those was a tech2 to boot! This thing was protected to the teeth.
---
Where are the moderators? This was already posted including AAR in https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/dgjl2c/our_place_in_the_food_chain/
---
good post just didn't really see it becuz most people don't pay attention to paragraphs, only saw it after their former corpies flagged it on discord (notice the comments that its the first time they've seen it)
---
That's great. I hope CCP sees your passion for it and actually fixes the warzone some time soon.
---
&gt;I can't think of a worse thing for a game like EVE - where people spend stupid amounts of time and effort planning ahead and building communities; where strategies and goals can take months or even years to achieve - than the devs not being able to even tell us what the game mechanics will be like a month from now.
---
Yep, the basic gameplay of EVE is pretty crap, it's only real strengths are community and the long game.  CCP seems hellbent on killing the community, and they've proven they have no issues ruining the long game through implementing random shit without thinking of the actual effects, so that breaks any trust and so removes one of the only things keeping a lot of people playing EVE.  Sad part is, I don't think they even understand this still.
---
If I wanted to just play a FPS 360 noscope game, which seems to be the crowd CCP is after, there are about a billion other games on market that do it way better than lolCCP does.  It makes no sense.
---
the magic that is those CALSF gila fleets
---
Oh, for sure, this is true for all factions. The new Rupture could be Caldari, if not for the paint scheme. The Minny designs of old were a mess of antennae, trusses, protrusions of all sorts. The OG Stabber/Vaga hull looked insane, and I loved it.
---
Well you need to be blind on both eyes to fit your Titan like this.
---
The killmail above goes way beyond having tanked up the wrong fuel or other kinds of fuckups.
---
Killmails like these are the reason we get so many dudes chilling in our space waiting to drop on some retard who fucks up.
---
If you join into Goons or the Imperium or one of its affiliates in gerneral you get bombarded with guides on how to fit yout ship, what to carry in your cargo, where to go for alternatives if you're to poor (fuck off you're flying a Titan) and in case we can import from Jita too.
---
Goons have a massive backbone in Industrial shit, if you desperately need something you can sure as fuck get it in Delve. I'm Certain!
---
Its pretty hard to shitfit something, especially since CCP actually did a good job with their simulation tool! Everything is crosslinked and you can doublecheck soooo easily.
---
That pilot was just obtuse and should be forced to take part in the most "how to basic class 101" there is.
---
People without clue that wanted to have a titan really bad before injectors, would just buy the character from bazaar.
---
Both ability to get enough isk and ability to find a seller without getting scammed or hunted down one mid out were the limiting factor here. Arguably ability to just contract/market sell titans (read: Keepstars) did the most harm here.
---
i dont know if the its still the same or if its changed i do know back when i cared sigs spawned at a set amount for a region and you had to run the sigs to make more spawn but they spawned in other systems i would guess this is the case
---
Okey so you want more risk, thats the thing right?
---
Can I ask you what the actual risk for the hunter is? Cause the way I see it, there really isnt any on that side either. Cause they can also be cloaky nullified as well right? And a good hunter needs less than 1 minute to scan you down.
---
I honestly dont really care either way but I do understand the issues of removing gates (like it would crash the entire thing cause your bookmark wont mean shit) and such will create issues. Can there be a better way? Probably ye. Will it be in the hunters favor? I dont believe hunters should have more advantages. 
---
But is this change relevant? Like dont we have a long list of things that would actually be better to change first?
---
It's pretty crazy to think that sometimes individuals aren't exactly the same as your perspective of their entire group huh! Welcome to teenage level comprehension of social situations.
