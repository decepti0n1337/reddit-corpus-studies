Looks like the guy got tired of losing all his viators and finally bought a neutral JF

Lmao. Thx
---
hey i was really against you before when i was brainless goon but now I gotta say keep up the good work man
---
2006 pilot here, i can fly frigates and destroyers, can ship spin like no one else. I'm also very lonely since my corp disbanded in 2010
---

---
If you don’t mind training into minmatar, the republic fleet firetail is decent at that. However, you’ll never really get under the guns of a frigate/destroyer, and a close range for cruisers will still hit you, especially if it has scram/web/neut equipped. Also drones will shred you. 
---
I would also suggest to try and join signal cartel. They are a explorer friendly group that can help you with finer point of exploring.

Is this a meme now?
---
I think you’re missing the point.
---
The best way is to join a big  newbro. nullsec corp, and either solo rat with a Vexor/VNI (if your Corp is half decent they’ll give you a dozen fits when you ask for one), or go on ratting fleets until you can afford/skill into a Vexor. 
---
Also, don’t only pve, that isk you are making is worthless if you don’t use it on some pvp ships

dumbest shit ive ever read

I like how the OP went straight for the best dread out there right off the bat. GG. 
---
U should have went rorqual then you would be able to have most other caps in a few months because isk.
---
Loosing shit you didnt want to lose is part of the fun of playing this game.
---
Sometimes you get great content, sometimes you are great content

it was probably an alt

Don't you go criminal for shooting wrecks?

and I hope he ganked him
---
Do you also do crossfit?
---
TEST's already got Legacy Coalition. Could be, they live near enough.
---
4 characters can run a top and a middle complexity P4 in a wormhole with daily extractor resets and factory resets, collect P1 every 2-3 days for average of about 100m/day. Making two top tier, two mid tier and one low tier complexity P4 on 8 characters going by the same scheme gets about 230m/day. There is probably a better effort/isk point than the daily reset, esp if hauling volume isn’t an issue so you can stop at P3 (P4 adds ~10% value over P3 but importantly halves volume).
---
I did not say I didn't nano or don't theorycraft, I said I don't remember the last time, other than what's mentioned, because I actually have a busy out of game life. But you can assume away cause your opinion means about as much to me as an annoying teenager. I swear there is a saying about assumptions 
---
Your kinda changing the goal posts here, but regardless. Eve has always been about bringing the right tool for the job. If you are unwilling to adapt, maybe stay in high sec. 
---
A proper gang that has been thought and theorycrafted by someone with a brain can easily outdo a super, but if you don't bring the right tools for the job then yeah your just Gona get memed on. 
---
If your not piloting ur ship properly then you are also Gona get memed on by a super. A siren only has dank speed for 20 seconds with a 60 second cooldown. If you find that oppressive then again your not bringing the right tool. 
---
But your assumptions are just making you come across as an arrogant "knowitall" so I guess I'll just end this "debate" with, you do you,  I'm out :) 
---
This is very relevant
---
Wow. This thread. Let me sum this up for you.... 
---
Urgaypwnd. 
---
Become a Wormholer and rule all the douches. 
---
Wormholer btw
---
YEah, I went through that phase (being ganked with 50+ mil in my Heron's cargo hold, inside a Wormhole).
---
The answer? Go for the Astero (it's quite easy to train its skills) and CovOps cloaks: being able to jump in &lt;3 seconds and instantly cloak during warp is the ultimate satisfaction.
---
You'll then be able to jump around undetected, scan EVERY exit or site from 100km wnhile cloaked in order to spot every threat or camp, and generally enjoy an entirely risk averse experience.
---
Someone shows up on your 360° d-scan? No problem, jump and cloak, then either wait it out or go for the exit while you are stealthed and untargetable.
---
Combat probes on d-scan? Good luck to your ganked, you'll just warp out and cloak, jumping from planet to planet while your attacker tries to jump around and find you on the D-scan before moving his probes.
---
So yeah, get and Astero e COvOps cloaks. The end.
---
That's what the group has been called internally to Legacy for over a year.  It's happened whether you quote Mean Girls or not.
---
The cheap exoplanet hunter skin can already coat catalysts in the New Order orange.
---
The only ship I remotely care about losing is my Legion.  Everything else will be replaced in time, but T3C also require retraining skills due to SP loss and that's a pain in the ass. 
---
You've got to learn early on that everything you undock will blow up.  Consider the ship lost from the moment you hit undock and just be pleasantly surprised if it makes it back to a station in 1 piece.  
---
I fly fancy pirate frigs in FW daily and lose all of them, but I like the way they look so I keep buying them.  Yeah I could just use punishers and merlins and stuff, but Dramiels, Cruors and Damaviks look cooler. 
---
When I run out of isk, I moon mine in a pair of retrievers, do some exploration and sell off LP from FW plexes and then buy more shiny shit to whelp. 
---
You'd like to feel a lot wouldn't you. Sorry princess, not this time. Go gobble that dick you boring, shit ass cunt. 
---
Yesterday I lost my precious succubus so I wrote a farewell letter about it to my corpmate who was also flying one for some time. Remind yourself that it was just an internet spaceship, harden up and reconsider your fiting and tactic so you won't lose a ship this way again.
---
The Mackinaw is most efficient for long haul trips. If you have to go a long way to sell your ore, and there aren't many rats, then a hulk isn't good because you'll waste time going back and forth over many trips, and a skiff isn't good because you don't need the bonuses to drone hitpoints and damage. So you can see they're each good at different tasks
---
The Skiff has more cpu so it can fit more shield because it has bonuses that help it fight stuff. This is the safest ship for solo mining
---
The Hulk is efficiency king but small cargo hold, so it's best with a Rorq/Orca or with a citadel nearby
---
Make jumpgates hackable so you can coopt one to bring the dread fleet into same system/in from other side?
---
Reinstall. Reset sett8ngs. Clear all caches. Buy new computer. And or dnt care about it
---
Almost like the idea would force capital ships to return to being strategic assets only as they’re difficult and slow to move around...

I know.. I know. I get a bit itchy when people exploit things or just being dishonest. Be it real life or games, I can get a little too emotional in my responses at times. I love you all. Be safe out there. ☺️
---
Right but you know I like to pretend. What is the name of your corp?
---
That's been a thing for a while in Test.  I think Sappo made it famous.
---
117m in 4 days?  It probably took me 4+ weeks to make that much as a newb. I'd say you are doing great.  If you want to avoid losing items you might want to try banking them in a mobile depot,  or doing runs back to safe space more often.   
---
Anyways if you went and got  70m in a few hours you can probably do it again.  And in hindsight 70m is going to feel like a cheap lesson. 
---
Are you that one evictus guy that had to delete his account since everyone called him autistic or are you a new one?
---
Where is gooneddit squad to dv this 
---
&gt; How is that different then an F1 monkey in a Dread bomb? 
---
if you think any entity outside a null blob can afford to have people f1 monkeying in their dread bombs I've got a bridge to sell ya. Even the 1kish char alliances that are competent enough to reliabily do this shit at this scale such as skillu and snuff have their drops *heavily* multiboxed, especially skillu. 
---
I know you're far beyond saving so don't even bother but that needed to be said for the people(especially newer players) who might be reading and get caught up on the bloc koolaid.
---
You go and put those lasers on. You be you. I believe in you. 
---
I have done all of that, including buying a new computer, ironically. 
---
All the ass mad on this post.
---
This! I still look back happily on those times.
---
Im the cloaked loki on grid.
---
Wish they died
---
Had someone steal the stuff from the site I was running last night. Didn’t really care because “cool man, you’re faster than me and I’d probably do the same thing if I could.” The irritating thing was him dropping it all in local and kept talking smack. I get it man. You got me. 
---
OP's username check's out.
---
OH! that explains it! Guten-tag my dear friend!
---
I'm genuinely surprised it hasn't been brigaded yet. 
---
The Mackinaw is far more efficient than the hulk if you have to go a long way to sell your ore. It's great at that. It does not need bonuses elsewhere. They could do away with 2 of the mid slots and it would still be great at what it is intended to do
---
The T2 barges all need to be good at specialised tasks or one would be absolutely better than the others all the time
---
The Mackinaw is great for a solo highsec miner that just wants to mine and then ferry their hold to sell at Jita. A Hulk would take more than 3 of those trips for 33% faster mining - not worth, a skiff would need more trips too,,and the buffs to it's drones would be redundant - not worth
---
I get that you want the mackinaw to have more build options though, have you tried using a cpu overclocking rig and skilling your support skills?
---
6/10
---
Mining with anything of their than a Rorq is for pleabs. Oh wait, I’m a pleab, fuck. 
---
This is a bad thread.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The fit is solid. No reason not to have a salvager in the last high when your already max'd on grid and have some random cpu spare. I mean sometimes you get some intact places and make 50mil. my only dissapointment would be the T1 vs. T2 salvager. it takes so much longer with a T1 salvager. I expect more next time. 
---
Lol the fact that you don't think "dank speed for 20 seconds with a 60 second cooldown" is not oppressive....when combined with a dromi with the same effect. Means that those long-range fighters have the same amount of time. The fact that you don't think support fighters are oppressive also makes it clear that you don't follow any of the major discussions or arguments. If there is one thing 90% of Null FC's and Nano-gang'ers can agree on - is that siren's and dromi's are oppressive. o7 m8. Enjoy this week's Meta Show and Fireside!
---
Wormholes can be awesome but terrifying.
---
Yes, time is precious, and yes, it can be really horrible losing that loot, but ask yourself: What did you learn? Was it worth it?
---
The gut reaction may be "fuck learning, I just lost 3 hours of time", but you lost three hours of time to some pixels and data entries in a video game. It may sound harsh, but it's true that none of this really matters in the long run. We all play to learn and have fun, and if you learned something critical in 4 days (learning to stay aligned took me 3 months) then you're going to be a lot better off.
---
 
---
Remember that you didn't spend a lot to make a lot, and you should remember what to fix for when you try splashing a hole again.
---
Happy exploring!
---
Good enough. I'll take it!
---
your best bet is to ask them what you done wrong 99%of us will tell you what you could have done and i pesonly reinburse very new but i wouldnt expect it 
---
Hey. This is really good.
---
I’m 15 years into this game and I am far away from being good at solo pvp, but I love to just grab a ship and go learn. Whatever happens, I’ll learn something new whether I die, kill or just come back with some new thoughts. 
---
Few games feel this alive where everything is really PvP. 
---
*has medclone in Hek*
---
:surprised_pikachu:
---
that's actually a pretty clever fit, replacing the medium for a small and a damage control.
---
superior even, since you can drop the overdrive and replace it with a mag stab. I'm not experienced enough to know which is more useful - i will hand it to you, you've outplayed me here.
---
Not being mean, but htfu.  You made the choice to stay out for 3 hours without returning to dump your loot.  Accept that that choice had consequences and they are negative.
---
If you have a pricey load in your cargo, dont do another site.  They are where you are most vulnerable and stand the biggest risk of dying.
---
Yeah,well, eve is kind of addicting, its a unique game. I had my first high ups when i looted 7 mil from site,then 20 mil, then managed to up it to 40 mil, and then, big low came when i lost those 70 mil today.
---
Thanks dude, I might pm you tommorow.
---
Oh yeah. None of us multibox.
---
Shame collective rarely undocks lately...
---
wat the kek is dis shit
---
they are the same guy? 
---
Thx for the tip.
---
Heh, thing is that I was aware of the danger lol, i was stupid though and risked it anyway. Once I saw combat probes in same solar system as me,and first one ship,then second ship, I knew I might have been done.
---
I however stumbled upon extremely good WH,it had like 25-30 sites,never seen anything like that before. Was harder to give it up knowning that when i return there might be no more sites left.
---
As an alternative, I would also recommend trying null explo.  It’s (arguably) bit safer because you have local, and if you find a good area to explore in, it can be just as profitable.  Safe flying!
---
Weird flex, but OK.
---
:bigthink:
---
Thx dude, why do you think Nullsec is better than WH? Does it contain better loot?
---
Lots of good advice in this thread, so I'll just add one thing - congrats for having the guts to explore out of high sec on day 4 in the game. 
---
Taking some risks is what makes Eve fun to play.
---
I can't wait for this shit to dissip8? 
---
Haha.....you know this is eve right?
---
Fleshlight more like.
---
What are the Russians writing in Jita? 
---
Thx,but I have a question:
---
Even if i bookmark it,but in a WH that would eventually close either naturally or player-induced, how will i return to it if I die? 
---
Or is there any way to find that WH once it would close?
---
Its not combativeness, it's pettiness. If he was ganked, he'd rage quit and never come back
---
Please consider this our formal apology.
---
 " I was aware they may have been looking for me"
---
and thats where you messed up. if you are decloaked in space and they want it bad enough they will come for you. if your interested in whs i would suggest you find yourself a wh corp.
---
This is so old that it even sounds new...
---
Happy cake day there, capsuleer!
---
I got like this, it made the game unfun, equated any time spent doing anything other than rorq mining as a cost in rorq hours. Sure way to burn out. 
---
I can assure you, dude with 20 rorqs wallet wont hurt spending 2 hours getting rigs and maybe a break will stop him burning out.
---
I retired to a wh with a trillion isk, I'll be back when it runs out.. any day now!
---
Thx :), they might be worth time only for LP I think, scanning would be more profitable however.
---
I did basic missions+combat and explorer, skipped the rest.
---
If i return, maybe I will do them for LP.
---
Seeing radist on killmail and his alt on tackle - it was less than a minute killmail.    
---
Was lsh btw. 
---
Welcome to J-Space.
---
Sounds like a great ship, friend of mine showed it to me, it costs I think around 100 mil just basic,right? I think I would definitely cry if I lost it. 
---
That guy really fucked Upt.
---
More like my 60 250m ships (going off t1 BS because that’s more realistic, or if that still seems implausible, my 20b of dedicated whaling comp ships, or my 4b+ of bombers) can’t kill a 4b ship that can safely hide the other 5b if it’s value...
---
That said, I agree with your reputation of the idea.
---
You mean the ‘accidental small smartbomb’ skin, with some taste of Concordokken?
---
where was that said?
---
55 for the hull -- pm me your ign and i'll contract you one when i get home
---
Thanks:D.
---
I was watching youtube tutotial videos for half a day (alfa to omega videos) and asking a lot of questions on rookie chat ingame. Learned a lot about game that way quickly,especially about scanning. Learned about the rest by myself. Game has a steep learning curve,but it is fun. As of right now I am going through weird phase of life where I want to learn about complex stuff,especially games (I still probably dont know 70% of the stuff).
---
It all started with Empyrion month ago, continued with Elite,and now Eve.
---
Nobody cares about your wormholing. 
---
Btw, I crossfit. 
---
I always wonder if the people who get told to kill pods trying to exit the system feel about not fighting in the actual battle.
---
I assume it means to continue the string of nines, just ran out of available digits to display the number. The value is the same using le old math tricky
---
x=7.99499999...
---
10x=79.9499999...
---
10x-x=9x=71.955
---
Divide by 9 and say YEET
---
x=7.995
---
How do you know someone is a wormholer? They'll tell you. 
---
Why didn't you also push his shit in
---
So epicccc
---
Don't bother with L3s in a battleship, just do L4s. It's much more worth it. 
---
At least it was just a small dread fleet from Domain. FC though he would have brought too much :D
---
Unecessary to say that this was a well planted trap and we took it.
---
Good Job so far from W.R.A.T.H, VO and SC for coming in and say hi :) 
---
if that happened to me i would immediately go and get a gank catalyst
---
I know,it was my fault. I did like 50-60 wormholes before this one and never encountered a player (or only rarely, but not hostile one,it was mostly just scanning ship except for these 2 that I encountered, and 1 of them destroyed me though ) and mainly,never a problem,therefore I considered WH to be pretty safe despite what I read. I was still pretty causious and paranoid, so I kept scanning. Made a mistake today, I thoughr they wouldnt kill me, even when I found combat probes in WH. They did.
---
now this is shitposting
---
I miss jamal 
---
what in the fuck
---
tldr
---
One day you will count in billions not millions and these losses will be nothing
---
Locator gank him for a month saying these are my killmails
---
Thx, I was doing high sec+low sec sites during first few hours after I finished tutorial missions. When I made my first few mil I decided to go for bigger fish, because I had enough for 1+ heron ships in case i died. I thought I wouldnt lose anything.
---
The fact that they are referred to that internally is hilarious, because that means even *they* don't consider themselves legacy unless test is present.
---
Just call them test pets and get it over with.
---
This isn't mine. Someone shared it on a Network Engineering slack server and figured others may get a kick out of it. 
---
I wish Jamal was still with us :( 7o
---
WH's are probably farmed by people who know what they're doing.
---
Nullsec you can see who is in system with you, you spend less time scanning too.
---
Everyone feels like that at the start, it gets less stressful to get blown up after it happens the first few times. 
---
0.o
---
I missed you
---
gout part 2 :(7
---
please don't mock someone's honest feelings about their lost friend thank you
---
Thx dude, appreciate it, not sure if i want to accept it :D. I mean,sounds great but I would feel bad if I did it. Im undecided. I will think.
---
Thx a lot :).
---
RIP Jamal, my only regret was that I didn't get to hear you say wormholerbtw one last time ;_;7
---
The gout got my best friend :(
---
Jamal was one of my best EVE friends, even though he would constantly dog the boys. Some of my fondest memories are from when he decided to do superelite DED runner hunting for two weeks, before losing interest and skill extracting all his hunters. Or when he decided to do solo super dropping on krabs for a week before losing interest and skill extracting his super. He also was a great ISK maker - he showed me how to C5 farm (which he did for a few weeks, before losing interest and skill extracting his Rattlesnakes) and how to Supercarrier rat (also extracted).
---
One summer, I visited Jamal and his boyfriend Yaolan in New Zealand. They had just gotten a shipment of 'toys' from another member of this little crazy group of psychos we call Capsuleers, Judy Mikakka. We frolicked late into the night, and I still look back on those "kiwi nights" sometimes as I drift off to sleep.
---
Either way, what I'm trying to say is, Jamal was a blessing to the EVE community, and he will be sorely missed...
---
My first thought was "oh shit, Olmeca just lost a lot of drones."
---
mods? 
---
&gt;  From reading forums, ppl were mostly nice towards &lt;new&gt; accounts,not this harsh.
---
You weren't wrong about this - the eve playerbase is often uncommonly nice towards new players, particularly compared to the brutally ruthless sort of reputation the playerbase has. What you were mistaken about is what 'being nice' consists of.
---
As you can see in this thread, veterans are generally very willing to give plenty of advice to new players. In fact, the biggest problem is often getting us to shut up! Similarly, you will very commonly find veteran players gifting newer ones ships, gear, or quantities of isk. This usually *won't* happen if you rage at losses or beg for stuff (vets view these negatively), but if you show enthusiasm and a willingness to accept loss and learn from mistakes despite inexperience you'll often find yourself gifted isk or ships - even from the people who just blew you up!
---
However, this doesn't mean vets will 'go easy' on you and not blow you up. Eve is a brutally darwinian sort of environment, and absolutely everyone is potential prey. Vets aren't going to *not* blow you up simply because you're new any more than a shark would decline to eat some sea creature just because it was a newborn. The general attitude is that it's more helpful to *teach* new players than coddle them. Eve is a harsh environment, and if you're going to succeed here you have to be able to withstand blows and setbacks and learn to overcome them. As such, vets are generally going to knock you down as enthusiastically as they would anyone else - the difference is that we'll help you get back up again afterwards and give you tips on how to not get knocked down next time.
---
One of the standard tips given to newbies is that when you die you should convo the people who killed you and ask for advice. Sometimes, of course, you'll just get ignored or get jerks who insult or taunt you - this *is* the internet, after all - but many vets will be happy to explain to new players what just happened, what mistakes you might have made, and how you could protect yourself next time. (And you might also get a donation or two.)
---
Not this again... 
---
ah I see, yeah I suppose, but would more LP stores and more taxes change much?
---
First thing to remember in wormholes, if you see combat probes and you cannot cloak, keep moving! Warp in different directions and drop bookmarks like crazy, the more the better! If you see combat probes, move and keep moving. Good probers can 100% you in one to two cycles if you sit still for too long. Shrug off the loss and get back to it.
---
It was pretty clearly implied that for some reason there is a difference between outside null blob F1 monkeys are different than outside null blob F1 monkeys, and that difference was multiboxing.
---
Ooh I fucking hated people like you those days. Good job
---
o7 capsuleer
---
Fc my cats missing what do? 
---
Dreddit is my corp, but any corp in TEST can join a sig
---
wormholer btw
---
Nah. I sell mine in Delve. I would most certainly lose hundreds if I tried to move them myself.
---
I too have a feeling that these are stolen drones though :)
---
Probably scams. Plug it into google translate if you’re curious
---
Ba-dum tss
---
Jamal was a good man, the worse place now.
---
Did exploration im WH a bit ago and while the loot per site was usually awesome there were only few relic sites available in the chains I scanned. I lack knowledge about WH anom spawn mechanics but suspect data/relic sites respawn slower than in NS and more people doing them.
---
Generally I found more sites in nullsec. Additionally a huge advantage in NS is that you can drop off your loot in NPC null stations before you return it to a market. 
---
Gate camps, site campers etc are a thing bur you can learn to handle it. Local has it’s part in making it easier.
---
I link you a superb reddit post of somebody who did sites in different areas and averaged the income per site. Data sites are worth much less than relic and commonly disfavoured to keep efficiency high.
---

---
Why are you upset about what some spaceship guild calls their conglomerate of spaceship guilds?
---
From the late-2013 date (and the list of participants) this battle would have been part of the Halloween War. This was a large scale war that, iirc, took place mostly in the south of the game universe and pitted the russian blocs and their allies the Clusterfuck Coalition (CFC) against the combined forces of the N3 coalition and Pandemic Legion (PL). I wasn't playing yet, and my knowledge of the relevant history is unfortunately vague, but I'm sure someone will be along soon to explain in great detail what this particular war was about.
---
You may be interested to read about the [Bloodbath of B-R5RB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodbath_of_B-R5RB), however, which was an epic battle that served as a climax for this particular war a few months later. (Yes, the battle *has its own wikipedia page*.) It's not the same particular battle in the video you linked, but it's a good explanation of how these sorts of large battles can go down.
---
Jamal always liked my bunny pictures ;-;7
---
no it wasn't, by definition being in or out of a nullblob is irrelevant to being a F1 dread monkey, the only place you will be accepted to be a F1 dread monkey however is in the nullblobs, that's the difference.
---
I mean hand these posts around to your friends and let them point out the obvious sexual tension you're throwing my way if you dont believe me. I'm making a logical leap here and assuming you have at least 9ne friend
---
[Me finding this thread this morning](https://youtu.be/XpprNxCCqcw?t=7)
---
I suppose you are right. I thought vets ingame tend to look at profile of the player before killing him (unless they get surprise attack) and would be more forgiving once they saw how long acc is. I suppose not,oh well :D
---
I guess they dont. After today I know im never safe in eve. 
---
Dreddit was actually my first corp. I guess im asking what a sig is
---
Would've shot the wreck. Destroying his isk right before his very eyes.
---
Well, that's exactly what it read like.
---
Our dreads are all alts too.  We're not such a bunch of dicks that were going to tell a dude he can't bring his Dread if it's not on an alt, but that shit is rare.
---
Why does everyone think they are the only ones who don't suck at this game?
---
You can have a one day old character sitting in a titan by injecting the skills. Character age doesn’t mean anything.
---
You always have exits from wormholes and most of the time you can take measures to improve the probability of getting a null/low/high hole.
---
You hit the nail on the head. Too many people do not realize that if they kick out all these scrubs, carebears, etc. then there will be no Eve for them to play in.
---
Pm me I'll SRP your loss and give you some more to keep at it. You will lose lots and gain lot's. The best way I've felt with loss is hoe can I do better. 
---
Also new player, how do i get this raid?
---
Even the characters before needed huge amounts of time and either subbed or plexed time at that. So its not that you couldn't do it, you could, and some people have, I traded a character once back in the day, basically sold off my miner and bought a JF pilot.
---
But the key is that it couldn't have been done anywhere near the scale with which it is done today with alphas + injectors.
---

Wormholes have whats called "Statics." Statics are the wormholes that will always spawn there, for example; a C2 with a null and c5 static. It will always have a null sec connection and a connection to a class 5 wormhole. So for now while you are new, youll want to find systems with hi-sec statics, for increased safety. If you somehow get rolled out, it will stay there, you just need to find your way back. Wormhoes can last (disclaimer there are two c6 static connections that last 48) 24 hours - 16 hours  from when it spawns. So with that knowledge, unless you belong to a wormhole corp (do eeet) you'll be whats called "day tripping." So you would scan, see if there are any sites, assuming there are quite a few, make a safe spot and drop the can. Then, after each of the sites go to the can and drop it fast (they can combat probe you, so if you sit in the spot they will have a warp-in to your no longer safe can.) Then once you are done with the sites, grab the loot and gtfo, get it to safety.

Why exactly is a dread fitted with salvagers? 
---
Wow, how do you do that?
---
What's your fit?
---
Sorry for the delay, I glanced at that then hid in my pillow fort, I've since returned and I'll definitely give it a try, intimidating though it be.
---
Stands for special interest group, small groups across an alliance that self organize, usually for specific content.  Generally they have their own comms and stuff.
---
&gt; I thought vets ingame tend to look at profile of the player before killing him
---
Generally this isn't practical. It could happen in a few circumstances, but most of the time stopping to check the profile of the person you're attacking is an unjustifiable risk given the advantage the delay could give them if they're *not* a new player. If they're going to check, it's usually afterward. And more generally, most vets probably would still blow you up anyway just on general principle, as I noted above, simply because that's what you do in eve.
---
Unwilling to reveal my fit bc as of rn afaik I'm the only person in my Corp doing this and I don't want competition. My gila fit is around 10bil and can blitz t5 abyssal. Tbh u can make that with any activity. It just takes isk to make isk
---
You should be rolled in tar and feathers.
---
Understand that there were probably a few guys that noticed your heron and decided it wasn't worth the effort.
---
If your going about uncloaked in a long chain, you will be noticed.
---
In friendly spirit, have you tried some of the wormhole mapping tools like pathfinder / siggy / tripwire?
---
https://www.pathfinder-w.space/ is relatively beginner friendly. I highly recommend you get used to it.
---
Ninja Salvage the Faction Fort?
---
Might have bin a shattered wormhole. Don't hack in those and try and get far away from them before you start.
---
Also, don't bother with cans. Just be proactive with dumping your loot, you will get plenty of highsec connections on your way through the c1-3 chain.
---
I got back into the game , explored in a stratios , had ~1.5 billion in loot in 3 hours. On the way back, I thought , maybe I should take this 3 jump detour to be safe. Been a while playing , I decided against it. The next jump was a gatecamp. RIP. Luckiest day in Eve turned into my unluckiest.

o7 friend...
---
As someone who plays in potato mode, please fix. The workarounds are a pain in the ass.
---
It makes complete sense: Voltron is a number of small parts coming together to form a bigger unit, who can stand toe to toe with the larger factions. This is the case here, as TEST is obviously large enough to stand alone, but the other Legacy alliances aren't. 
---
Why are you so pissed off over how we call ourselves? And yes the name's been used for a long while, so you're not going to change anything.
---
Nothing says "I love you" like a killmail.
---
But those parts aren't coming together. They're already part of a group. The only difference between them and legacy is that test isn't there. So, in order to form voltron, you have to remove test. It's the opposite of forming voltron.
---
Lowsec voltron made sense because they were groups that were not already aligned with each other. They grouped up to repel goons, then went their separate ways afterwards.
---
That is not true. There is somewhat of a separation between Voltron and Test for operational reasons, there always has been. Don’t pretend to know how we operate if you have no idea.
---
I see more excavators going out than in usually.  
---
Then why is voltron defined as "legacy minus test"?
---
Kill first, give advice and possibly isk later.
---
Well, it’s easier to explain to people who aren’t in Legacy. I guess we could also say “Voltron, the group composed of Brave, Requiem Eternal, Dangerous Voltage, Rezeda Regnum, The Watchmen., Federation Uprising, Tactical Supremacy, Warped Intentions, Drone Walkers and Evictus.”, but that doesn’t roll off the tongue so well.

Who determines what is a good suggestion?  It isnt any of us, in the end it is ccp.  So what you or &gt; or the rest of the playerbase view something as good they are the final arbiters of that. 
---
I say keep making suggestions. Just dont expect them to be implemented in ways you might expect if they feel it is good. 
---
close call epic post !! 
---
Not really, because it doesn't make sense. Test and "voltron" are part of the same entity, legacy. What you're describing sounds more like California + all of the other states. Except all of the other states started calling themselves USB or something. In this analogy, the EU can be goons, I guess.

---
This is such an idiotic way to have a conversation. "HAHA SALT LOLOLOL" Can we stop being game partisan cunts for 2 seconds and just discuss this like adults? A 5 man gang jumping into nullsec is likely going to be outnumbered anyway. Mostly flying cruisers, destroyers and frigates, they're not going to be able to "just kill the Siren." A cruiser will be pointed and insta alphaed by fighters. Wormhole small gang groups see supers, they just re-roll and that's that. We used to have a way to use ECM to negate some of the fighter effectiveness but that's gone.
---
Oh I certainly brought up Rorqs numerous times. The reply was always "HAHA UR POOOOOR BUY UR OWN RORQ HAHA" and that's pretty much the level of intelligence I'm seeing here as well.
---
You're retarded. Nobody said any of that.
---
How? As you pointed out, they are former employees.
---
No I'm just pointing out that capitals were supposed to operate in such a way that they required subcap support. SkillU is a nullsec blob group. Not everyone can just ping 100 man fleets to deal with a super.
---
You’re being facetious 
---
As someone who has played the game on an off since Castor I feel that most of those barriers have been erased over the years. The only barrier that really remains is that you can be blown up at any time while undocked.
---
Though in today's gaming world of instant gratification, and never having to suffer consequences I guess that this game still is harsh.
---
Then let's go back to that if even you can get kills that way.
---
Not saying a small gang should be able to threaten a super cap. I'm saying that a super cap shouldn't be able to zoom fighters faster than a frigate across the grid and lock down/insta alpha a group without support.
---
Dont be afraid of that loss. You now know you can make that 70 million, your next step is to learn how to get away with it too. If watching your ship get tackled and going up in flames creates a brief moment of terror in you, you are doing it right. Just need to learn to control it so you dont freeze and you can try to save it.
---
Honestly, you do get over it. After a few more ships get blown out from under you and you spend more time waking up in a brand new clone, it becomes second nature to just re-ship and get back into the swing. 
---
A couple of words of advice:
---
What is in your cargo hold doesn't count to your losses. Only once you get it back to a station does it become yours. It doesn't matter if it is a metal scrap or a high-grade omega blueprint worth enough to essentially buy a planet, the money isn't yours until you get home. What you lost out on was potential income, not actual. Yes, it sucks. But you only lost your shipm not your wallet.
---
Assume that any ship you see is going to kill you. Especially in wormholes. If you can see them, they can damn well see you. And if they can see you, they will come with blood in their eyes while planning all the horrible and perverse things they will do to your corpse. Your only recourse is to immediately GTFO. Especially in something as tissue-thin as an exploration frigate. Even if you're in mid-hack. Warp off to a safe spot (You do know how to make those, right? I hope so.) and then pray they don't know which hole you're aiming for to leave the system.
---
I lost a t3 cheeser to a t4 electrical, be very careful around the drifter BS waves. 
---
So...entering a hostile empires space, and getting a response from a dispatched group of ships is what you expect yes? That seems to be the case of what happened.
---
You're wanting a group of non heavy asset wielding gangs to mess with what is effectively an empires assets, and are upset why they would respond with a bit of force?
---
Yes capitals are more potent than they used to be, but in many ways weaker. Slow cats used to be n+1 and youd need several fleets to break them. And several more to replace the lost assets.
---
You want to kill a super, bring dreads, bring bhaalgorne battleships to nuet. Bring a fleet not a small gang.
---
You want to kill several. Well multiple the former assets.
---
Cruisers and frigates would never have stood a chance to a super even before these fighters and these fighters require much more attention than they used to.
---
And you're wrong you can still ecm the fighters it's done all the time.
---
As for wh small gangs, they are small gangs not super carrier wielding empire. Just gangs barley even a power force save a few. And even than their power lies in the whs.
---
Hows that...
---

Pretty much anything you have in this game can be lost. Be wreckless and enjoy the moment itself, don't be too focused on isk making, gain actual experience. The next time you come accross a similar situation you'll likely react differently.

---
I think you have a problem with your eyes and you can't read. Nobody said a small gang is supposed to be able to kill supers. I said that a super being able to point things at fighter range is nonsense. My only suggestion is that capitals should not be able to tackle sub cap ships. That's it.  
---
You can't ECM fighters. You ECM a fighter the fighters blow up your ECM ship in seconds.  
---
Curious to know what "empire assets" small gangs "mess with."
---
That's not a thing. Nobody says that. 
---
Agree, and this is coming from a guy who started in January of 2017 (back when EVE first went F2P but being an Alpha really was an "*indefinite trial*" as some put it).
---
EVE's not a game for casual players who want to wallet warrior into a BB on day 3 because they've been trained to think "Bigger Ship = Better Ship!" by games like Star Trek Online. EVE suits people like me and my dad. He introduced me to EVE (his char's name is on the EVE monument), and taught me all the *real* ins-and-outs of how to make money in EVE.
---
That, and we both enjoyed spending hours on end killing rats, shittalking, and planning fits. Now, is my way of playing EVE the only way? Not by a longshot!
---
But I'm just saying that...you either love EVE or you hate it, and it doesn't take long for a newcomer to figure out which.
---
They're splashing through the hole buddy

The only reason anyone would reform shekel is to evict pospy again, and damn that's tempting

Are pirate mission corps a thing?  I tried to just "get out there and do it" and the mission hubs were way to dangerous and I died instantly.  This is for a new alt that I will omega once my skills and standing are there but not right away.  Or will I need to do it my own with 2 omegas so I can scout myself?  I would much rather just find a chill group of dudes that I can do it with and have some fun fleets pvping mixed in, but I'm not sure if that's a thing as I haven't found it on evejobs or ingame channels.  Thanks.
---
Yeah that probably died years ago. It'd be either hole fire or hole activation, haven't heads splashing in years. 
---
Give me 10 bill and I’ll double it.

Oh, I still hear it, I fly with former Wingspan pilots though, so they're absolute scrubs

It's funny because it's loss, and he lost a ship.
---
Oh is that where is comes from, I just know that there's a voltron discord and all the pings are at God awful times for AUTZ so I have almost nothing to do with it, the only sub coalition in legacy I was aware of was the AUTZ Tactical Wattage 
---
You shouldn't be down on yourself like that man.
---
If you wanna put together something for him in DFW let me know I'm sure the local shitheads here will be happy celebrate his life.
---
You didn't lose 3 hours for nothing, you (hopefully) learned something from the experience. Basically if you see any sign of another player in a wormhole GTFO (if you are hacking a can at the time, you *should* have enough time to finish the hack and warp ... but that's still a risk.)
---
And the basic rule is once you undock in something ... consider it as written off and gone until you finish whatever you are doing and dock back up. Just the same as nothing material is ISK until you have safely returned to your station/citadel.
---
Just keep at it, it might seem like a huge amount of money now, but you'll be shrugging off a loss like that eventually no troubles.
---

https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/28s5l7/transaction_data_for_896_plex_sold_to_buy_orders/ so here's a fun thread from foooorever ago, but that doesn't have real good data on it.
---
Here's some data from my archived wallet (which is only a small portion of the trading I did)
---
I bought a total of 896 PLEX, totalling outlays of 627b isk (avg price: 695.3m each).
---
I sold a total of 885 PLEX, totalling inlays of 620b isk (avg price: 708.7m each). These figures accounts for taxes.
---
This leaves 11 plex, which were presumably used to plex my accounts. If we exatrapolate to 11 more sales we get...
---
outlays: 627b isk
---
inlays: 627.8b isk
---
Margin: 0.1% each, after 0.25% combined sales+broker taxes. (I had ridiculous standings, and fees were much lower then)
---
At a 0.1% margin that's ~700k per plex flip.
---
If you check that thread you'll see that some people liked to drop *lots* of plex. I only had a few billion in capital to flex, so it's not like I was making the most money I possibly could.
---
Some more numbers in a second.
---
I'm not sure about swapping out the missiles but perhaps throw a target painter in your mids to help with damage application while keeping the bonus
---
"There's so much more to this game than sitting in an asteroid belt"
---
"Just go out there and fight"
---
True words. I think a lot more people would enjoy this game if they fought and died more. 
---
You said it right there. You knew you were in danger, but proceeded anyway. Isk is like experience in other games, you lose it, you gain it, it really doesn't matter that much.
---
Look up Eve university 
---
Another datapoint.
---
I dabbled in trading jump freighters *veery* briefly. Protip: The people who manufacture freighters are not usually the kind to also dump them on a buy order.
---
I purchased 3 Rheas for a total of 18.617b isk. I sold them for 18.885b isk. A cool 240m profit. It just took a while to get them and to get rid of them. Money better spent elsewhere. If you have the extra cash to splash (and margin trading) then don't be afraid. Just don't expect to move mountains.

A noob in a sister alliance crossed paths with me while I was roaming. He asked if we could join up.  I told him that every time people fly with me they die.  He said it wasn’t a problem.

ah, i looked up a syrilic alphabet, and it looks like "СДР ЯАТИКО" to me. i plugged it into google translate and got "SDR HATIKO" which is very similar sounding to the IPA sounds that wikipedia gives for the letters. plugging that into translate gets a prompt to translate it from finnish, which gets "SDP did". i'm going to assume that SDP (or СДР) is a group in EVE, and they basically just put up a "СДР was here" sign. could be completely wrong, but that's my best guess.

Here is what you do.  Buy it.   Fit any fitting you can get on it but make sure it somewhat resembles a solo PvP fit.  Fly it through lowsec (it is a cap after all) STRAIT into nullsec.  Do NOT stop until you lose it.  Once you are back in station you will feel such a sense of relief and still have the shakes so bad you will not be able to wait until you do it again.
---
If you're doing multiple regions I would probably do 1 character per region, just for ultimate lazy mode.
---
Just try 1 character to start though. See if you're actually fine with it. No need to over-invest.
---
You buy too much crap on the market? You can just dump that onto someone else for minimal loss.

You buy/plex another character? You're stuck with it.

You think that's bad? I've lost 2 Loki's after months and months of training and raking in isk to afford them only to lose them on the first couple of npc site runs in a wormhole to try and make their cost back. The first time, I was like ah well maybe it was just bad luck, I should join a WH corp. Second time, boom... dude wtf this WH is my corps WH and I'm still getting ganked after hours of research on how to avoid this. Lesson learned many times over the 10 years on and off at this game, don't fly more than you can afford to lose. You win some you lose some. Don't think in isk/hr. You play for those times when you sneak a bucket of cash out from under their noses. Sometimes you win, sometimes you get blown up.

you still can t answer a simple question. Ashamed of what you really are? I alrdy told you, I m no tampon. I don t go for mining ships.

I don t come to the forums and ask for easy kills on ships that can t fight back. That s for wanna be elitists who worry more about their KB then actualy enjoying the game.

Make sure you drop off the cargo at a safe spot (if it's too valuable for you) before attempting a relic site in wormholes. Carrying a mobile depot helps, but random jetcans at mid-warp safes also work. In that case, if you get ganked and die in the relic site, you have 2 hours to come back and retrieve the loot ( or 48 hrs in case of mobile depot).
---
B-R wasn't the climax tho. After the battle, PL managed to reach a agreement with DRF (the russians) and the CFC. They where allowed to evacuate all their assets from the area and in return would leave the war. The CFC, who where getting tired at fighting long battles in defence of a group they didn't care about, considerd the war a job well done (they saw b-r as "the climax") and also evacuted their stuff and left the war "in glory".
---
Now we only had N3 and the russians left. N3 kept pushing forward and the Russians collapsed a few months later.
---
So N3, the group that was so horribly defeated and humiliated at that supposedly decisive battle of B-R ended up winning the war.

Toon is about 2mo old and was basically sitting near broke until 3 days or so ago when I hit a lucky streak getting escalations and faction spawns on Serpentis Refuges and now I've got 310m liquid and another 100m in deadspace modules I need to sell.

novice plexes do exist... and faction frigs and T2 frigs can enter those too. So too bad there isn't a Low-Tech Novice Complex?

Nope, doesn't even seem to trip suspect status, now this is all regarding looted ones. No idea what the case is on ones with loot still inside.

As a fellow network engineer, i enjoyed this. Thanks for sharing!

I stopped playing. Easy. 
---
Well I haven’t heard that Draco is officially leaving, but if he is IOU certainly wish him well. Draco has been apart of the IOU team for some time, provided content and actually was in the same corp as Ramweezy the OP, when Ramweezy was in IOU a while back.
---
It’s unfortunate when petty jealousies materialize in forums like Reddit and someone tries to drive a narrative that isn’t always accurate. 
---
EVE is a game and should be as much fun as possible, for everyone. Disagreements happen, FC egos are a thing and people sometimes need a change.
---
Heck I remember an FC that used to bring us lots of content in the Immensia campaign. He was full of piss and vinegar, tried new stuff, whelped constantly. Was trolled mercilessly.
---
He was a good shit, people enjoyed shooting the breeze with him. They even put up with his damned parrot and mother screaming at him in arabic to clean his room. 
---
This FC wasn’t perfect, but he felt he was better than the KBs reflected. He eventually got frustrated and decided he too needed a change. He said to himself why be a big fish in a small pond, when I can be a minnow in an ocean! So off to Test he went. 
---
When he left, IOU wished him well. The other FCs had their thoughts on this young man, but nobody went on Reddit to troll him as he left. Sure jokes were cracked on mumble and discord about the fleet whelps, or his little brother kicking his ass on comms, or the terrible internet connection he had running the client from the shipping container from behind the Walmart. But nobody ever took their beefs public.
---
Sometimes we need a reminder that this is just a game, and we sometimes take it too seriously. I know I have regrets over things I’ve said and done, especially recent remarks about a colleague. I’m sure Ramweezy has regrets too, like joining Hard Knocks or trigger happy Reddit posts possibly.
---
Note to OP, the door is always open. Heck we even left your room same as you did, waifu pillow and all. 
---
Come home Hamcheezy, we miss our alliance kick around guy.

---
Damn look at that sick ORE paint job
---
I mean, the rule of thumb (imo) is trust only those you have reason to trust. I'm not going to hesitate to trust pretty much everyone in my corp, nor my mates, because I've known them for ages. 
---
I don't trust everyone in the corp with 30b, but most of them I wouldn't worry about. Most of them have 500b+, and getting kicked over a measly amount of money is unlikely. 
---
Honest answer: the more isk/h you make, the less you care.
---
I have multiple accounts I can make ISK with while I roam with my main.
---
If I undock in an Assault Frigate on my main, I'll have made that amount back while I VNI rat with an alt in the background.
---
If I put in some effort, I can realistically make about 300m an hour (over 3 accounts), with PI, trade, industry, mining, VNIs.
---
So if I undock in a T2 Cruiser, I'll have money for a new T2 Cruiser in just in about an hour or so.
---
I fly what I can afford to lose and the point of hurtful loss is somewhere around the 600m isk mark, but even then I wont be sad. I've lost an excav and was somewhat unphased. I guess the point of true devastation would be somewhere around 10b.
---
I’ve been playing for about a year, and am fairly rich, and still can’t imagine dropping money on injectors. 800 mil is maybe 2 days of good exploration, which is time I can’t do any fun stuff in. If I die, that timer resets, plus 50 mil to buy my ship again. So depending on my luck I’d say an average of 3-4 days of playing wasted. Just not worth it to skip a week of training. 
---
The T3C SP loss is artificial and arbitrary anyway.
---
You take it as an additional fee when evaluating the ship cost in terms of skill injectors needed to compensate that loss, which is about 350m, I think. Not that much.
---
With comms ( plus the worst music I've ever heard).  Oh my.
---
Ah yes the not so rare type of reddit user the ass wipe
---
As you make more ISK, losing ships will hurt more because of the time required to get a new one, lost potential earnings due to not having said ship, missing out on KMs, etc.
---
Basically, stick at it. I remember losing a 5m ratting catalyst my first week of eve and thinking I was done. I didn’t play for a few days, then decided to give it another shot and I’ve been fucking addicted for 2.5 yrs.
---
You’ll get there! Just gotta suck up the losses and learn from them. Always assume the worst, e.g. in a wormhole, there’s always a cloaked proteus watching you, ready to call in a fleet of T3Cs from a WH in sys. 
---
&gt;make a clean get away before Immensea is all but lost.

Sorry ram, you're retarded.
---
*needle hits record* you spin me right round baby right round like a record player right round round round.
---
Yes, it's surprising and sad that Imperial Legacy is 65% of the playerbase and only fields 40 people. But good luck with the salvage!
---
A normal established player income is about 100mil/hour with one account. Take all of this as learning experiences and be thankful EVE gives you the opportunity to make 70mil even though you only started 4 days ago, most newbies get stuck mining in high-sec or worse join a high-sec mining sweatshop corp. 
---
Just know that with explo loot and most other things in EVE, it's not yours until you're docked up in your home station with it.  
---
But you also had fewer enemies with high sp. if you started 10 years ago you were at most 6 years of sp behind a day 1 character. And a much larger proportion of the player base would have been relatively new. 
---
Now? Old players have alts and have the isk to inject into anything, so you’re not only 16 years of training behind, but if people have injected it can be more than that. And being new is less and less common, so when you run into an enemy odds are much higher that they have massively higher skills than if you ran into someone a decade ago 
---
:jamal:
---
T2 frigs cannot enter a novice. And if you fit your ship for max neuts and then a bit of dps, a t1 frig can easily kill a faction one. Well, assuming the faction one relies on capacitor to shoot. 
---
You tried to lecture me on how 20 leshaks don't take 20 minutes to shoot a rorqual unless they are t1 fit. I asked if you have EVER shot a rorqual with leshaks or are you just basing that on bullshit. You obviously haven't. You don't come to forums asking for easy kills. You come to reddit and talk out your ass. 
---
If you're a crossfit vegan on the Keto diet and you're also a wormholer.......
---
WHAT DO YOU TELL STRANGERS FIRST????
---
Im a WH'r :)
---
There are people that mine, fill up their hold, then go to jita to sell raw ore?
---
Find a system with reprocessing enabled and compress your ore, then use a procurer (which can hold 200m+ of compressed highsec ore easily) to ferry it to jita so you don't get ganked on the way.
---
All ive seen is people complaining about capitals, but seems like the main issue been left hidden. The most oppressive of all the ships, condor and t1 frigs in general. Ccpls nerf, how come can gang that costs 2mil kill my 80mil afk boat, absolutely disgusting and unbalanced

I love it

Just be so space-rich that losing a bill in a day doesn't bother you.
---
How did he die in 0.0?
---
Get used to it.
---
&gt; B-R wasn't the climax tho
---
That's why I said *a* climax, not *the* climax. \^\^ I just didn't want to try to get into the entire history of a war that I'm not confident I truly understand. 
---
Those were my eve golden years, hoping around in the C3 pocket with Nexus and co, welping slashers every damn night in the middle of fucking massive rupture sniper battles. God I miss that shit.
---
A ninja looter doesn't convo first, and telling them to fuck off before they do anything wouldn't stop them from stealing your loot anyway, so trust doesn't really factor in to this.
---
How do you EVE with limited playtime and life interruptions? 
---
I’m an on/off player looking to return and trying to find an activity or place where 1-3 hours a night can contribute or at least enjoy my time.
---
My most enjoyable time was with Horde during WWB/Casino Wars, but I got a bit burnt out and feel guilty when I can’t join ping fleets or stay on for big fights due to life obligations.
---
Any recommendations on style of play or corps that allows EVE on a limited time budget? Do I just need to change my perspective?
---
Don't forget to remind everybody what statics you have. That's a wormholer thing too.
---
&gt;(it also makes me feel better about kicking homeless people IRL).
---
Maybe that's why I haven't seen ISK from other players. I'm a 15 day old homeless player. Though I don't really consider myself homeless anymore I still have zero income. I've been ganked twice by the same guy. First time it was the CEO of the Smartbomb syndicate acting alone. Not a big deal, took out my Venture loaded with Omber. Second time he and 4 other members of his corps took out my new Praxis. That one hurt a bit more even though it was empty at the time and I was just trying to get it transported home to outfit as a mining rig after purchase.
---
Sorry, who?
---
Back up, store your loot more often if 70m loss is too much for it. This is eve, as long as its not cashed in as isk, you havent really earned it yet.
---
This is a game where you have to listen to other players though, to an extent. The actual game tells you next to nothing. Anything you 'figure out' will probably be assisted by a guide written by other players. So I don't see what the problem is here.
---
Smash his shit in, it'll give him the drive to strike back harder 
---
If you have to haul ore a long way with a Mack then you are doing it wrong. Plain and simple and that makes your point pretty much invalid.
---
Even a brand new character can grab a venture and make much more than the bounty/loot of local belt rats in the starting system. 
---
I wonder who's the top maller smartbomber
---
Not gonna lie,  I haven't either.   Been busy IRL, and not a whole lot going on in the south it seems when I check in.  
---
I got some alts cooking for the summer though 
---
I fly what I can afford to lose multiple times over. The game is less fun when you're too scared to give it a go. 
---

  ...yolo.... Almost killed a vexor... Almost.

Let me just wrap these excavs up, no one in the history of ever has wrapped expensive items therefore gankers will be none the wiser!
---
My dislike with both fits is that you’re putting too many slots into increasing the PG or CPU as well as already being on the limit. When you’re using two low slots and a medium to fit another med shield extender it’s time to step back and try something else. Or perhaps add fitting implants into the mix.
---
Well, there is a large space between "ignoring cap damage" and getting wrecked within seconds from fighters. Counterplay against fighters are simply too weak, that you have to concentrate all forces to defanging, which causes you to lose the fight, or ignore them, which causes you to lose the fight again...
---
I would really like a subcap doctrine that does enourmous damage while getting little damage from caps, but are basically glass cannons. Like a XL weapon battleship that can activate a "force" mode which gives them insane dps and AB speed (or/and lower sig), but polarizes the defense. So they can be hunted down by small subcaps.
---
Like this, capitals need a subcap support again, while there is also a play against capitals if you have subcap superiority. With hacs and assault frigs or basically with any ship that has special abilities due to active modules, we only saw nice outcomes yet. Worst case is, those ships are either too weak or too strong, but only in terms of their numbers. And number balancing is always easier than mechanic balancing.
---
vOv meh, not my alts. You go to any hisec these days you're bound to find 5+ chinese bots krabbing away.

You’ve inspired me to start smartbombing, I was gonna go rokh but I now see I should trust the rust.

That is not a surprise based on what has likely happened to him while playing Eve, that you went all offended at it shows more about you than him.    The next step would have been to ask him about his attitude and why he was so terse if you were being true to your mentor, but I guess that was too difficult?
---
If this story is true, thank you for sharing.

That’s a really bad investment.

You could invest all that money in intact armor plates let’s say and you would’ve made 1,8bil profit way faster and less risky
---
Yes...but you need to make it into your first station before you can ship spin.
---
Op if you go into the plex market faction standing does not matter at all, because both buy and sell orders will be done in a citadel. The skills for the trading tax are a must. And you can move the plex via the plex vault. 
---
I'd suggest to start off with multiple orders for 500 plex both buy and sell. Always check the brokers fee and always check for extra zeros.
---
Don't ever leave plex in a citadelif you have an excess but keep them in your plex vault. Don't leave any orders when your trading session is over.
---
Yes, as I said it was not an efficient means to turn money over.
---
I actually almost consider having the idea of having respect for joe these days.

Now, seriously, this is a game. How do you react if you lose a chess match? How do you react if you lose a football match? Sure you feel a bit bad but you become better and win the next one. Oh, and someone alrady mentioned it: the loot in your cargo isn't worth anything until you're some place from where you can create a hauling contract (Highsec/your alliances staging). As a further though, it's the reason why Eve is so interesting. In most computer games you don't feel like this. But in other games you do, too. If you trained for something for a while and then lose you feel bad. But it also means that you feel good if you win.
---
This is actually good. This is how you learn. With cheap losses like that

Losing shit is pretty much the point of the game, kinda like gambling. 
---
I do that too sometimes, people invariably reply saying "oh how nooby ahcktually you know opportunity cost is a thing" to which I invariably say "yes you're special you know extremely basic economics"... People sometimes just like to build, for the hell of it. Not everything has to be isk/hr oriented, if it was you'd probably just get bored.
---
Ok, that would be very special

Also if you're in a wormhole you don't show up in local chat so there's no way of checking your profile unless they can physically see you

I forgot to fuel my POS a few days ago and lost 1.6bil when they killed my carrier. :( I can always get more isk though and buy another one. I learnt not to forget my POS fuel too :) ISK isn't the end all be all of Eve, unless you want it to be I suppose.

My favorite region description is the one for Paragon Soul.

Some systems have descriptions too. My favorite is for EC-P8R in Pure Blind (very fitting), although the lore goober in me really appreciates the the one for 37S-KO in Stain. Half a dozen systems in the Great Wildlands have descriptions taken from Thukker writings, and Sahtogas has one related to the Blood Raiders. There's also a cute one for D4J-PP in Oasa:

It's hard enough, as an industrialist, living with 30 people coming through your system per night, looking to either gank your ship, your excavator drones or something else. Making it harder to rat and mine only serves to not bother playing if you can't even undock to do your industrialist activities without a defence fleet being effective anymore.

Actually, Mittens logs into Eve everyday. You probably just don't know it. It's not like he plays his Mittens character for all to see, unless it's space important. Most of the time, he's probably playing one of the leaders in Panfam or the other side. :P

I love the solo feeling. A while back i have flown a pimped cruiser, costing about 3 times as much as the usual fits for it. I just love it and loose it here and then.
---
This time, ipimped it even more for the laughs and put on an AB which made it 4 times as expensive. Resulting in an increase of 70ms.
---
After that, i got into a fight where i got pinned down from an Inti. I aligned out and sent a set of light drones to it. I managed to fly away \~220km with an AB while now going about 700ms. While aligning out there arrived a Vigilant and some BS, trying to catch up.
---
Long story short, i managed to kill the Inti when the Vigi was 20km away from me, luckily out of scram range. After the initial rush i calculated the (estimated) time it took me to float that far and the distance the 70ms gave me during that time. The Vigi would've been about 18km closer. Oh bois. I should pimp even more!

Miners in regions like Delve lose only about 4% of their income in the form of pve ship deaths. In the worst organized regions this ratio is 25%. In many average regions 12 to 15 percent. The big gap between average regions and heavy umbrella regions motivates miners to huddle up and move in umbrella regions. Then less ships die in the game overall creating a stagnation in everyday pvp, followed with other kinds of stagnation such as no major nullsec wars (if one side consists of 600 Titans belonging to huddled miners, and the other side 250 titans, plus the crowded side can replace losses 3 times as fast, then no fight will occur).
---
Meanwhile, pve ships are supposed to be one of the most important content drivers. One miner's rorqual lost makes hours of hunting (so hours of Eve gameplay) worth playing for fleets of 10, 30, 50, or sometimes 100 people. When these ships are fenced in extremely safe conditions, and when people can't kill them anymore, its these people who stop bothering to play Eve. Lack of pvp content is the real reason why Eve has been diminishing in subs.
---
So I argue that, by changes in game mechanics, the minimum risk should be pulled at about 12-15 percent in the safest regions, and should go up to 25 percent in the less organized ones. Think of it as a content tax. People won't suddenly stop mining because their income is taxes 10% more. Someone with 10 rorquals won't stop mining just because his isk/HR is now 1.35 billion instead of 1.5 billion. 
---
Try playing on the PvE server.
---
I like to look for things with at least 20% arbitrage. That will give me plenty in return and allows room for it to move.

:thinking:
---
I agree. Plenty of Rorquals die everyday, even in Goonspace Rorquals die regularly. The difference I guess is, that in Goons, killing one rorqual off, doesn't stop us. There's probably 500 rorquals mining at anyone time in our space. We've simply outmassed the rest of eve with mining. If you want to be a super power, you need a super fleet. The way to build a super fleet, is to have a super industrialist base. We have that. I wish others stopped blaming "the Rorqual" and start blaming themselves for not realising how to play the game early enough.

Yes.

The big thing on hacking is the integrated analyzers. Works on both relic and data sites at the same time and bonuses to relic or data analyzers apply to the analyzer. 
---
If you are already familiar with scanning, operating while cloaked, and watching dscan to keep yourself alive while you do something else then i would just jump into hacking.
---
Avoid Unsecured and Forgotten relic/data sites period in wormholes and avoid covert research facilities until you are super familiar hacking or flying something like a stratios that can tank the explosions (these will pop frigates.)
---
What if it could only be recharged by spod mining? 
---
except slave pod arks with ANPs is how they can tank alot
---
Hm, don´t see any discount while logged in. Maybe because I am from Germany? Maybe they have regional discounts?

I hope that's Olmeca Gold's alt logistics. Would be dissapointed if some random jump freighter got cockfucked and had to pay someone 70 bil as collateral.

i remember the name from when he smartbombed some hisec bear's garmur and it was funny as shit. i didn't read the whole thing cause i'm tired and lazy so i'm not sure whether he biomassed, died, quit the game or it's just his bday. anyway i hope he's alright

should have just sold them in 1dq on a 1 day old alt
---
You wish! Eve is rated T.
---
I know how hard they can tank, but i don't think it matters if you [get tackled on a moon](https://zkillboard.com/location/40246827/) more interesting, [it seems a horde vanguard structure died there not too long ago](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73474091/)
---
Slightly less damage, but better tracking and probably faster than sending a mixed size bag of  drones. I have wondered the same. 
---
If you're running the same sites with the same damage type, probs mixed bag n skip the shiny geckos?

Eve is a seasonal game, this time of year the majority of the Northern hemisphere is trapped inside. Not saying that is the reason for sure, but in enough years watching that trend it is noteworthy.

Best was 60%
---
But why do you need to balance them. Eventually, the super caps will want to go fight, and we have more B-R style fights. That's why CCP made the rorqual active mining.
---
Providence is NRDS (no-red-don't-shoot) so provi based alliances won't shoot you if you are neutral, set the provibloc to blue to recognize them and then keep an eye on the local, when someone who's neutral enters you just go in safe

Later in your career you will be at a place when you can easily make the isk you lost today in very little time safely, if you play your cards right and join a good Corp.

Blops ships should be the one hunting miners/ratters, not conventional forces. Conventional pvp forces, should be fighting other conventional pvp forces and not wasting their time trying to gank the other's industrial base. For the most part, blops ships are the ones I see in Delve. So as far as I'm concerned at least, the game is functioning as intended.

I removed Lutris and installed the latest version, which was just released.  To my surprise, EVE installed without an issue and launched normally after I enabled "DirectX 9" in the launcher settings.  I'm on Ubuntu 18.04.

Bots can speak?
---
In Null you have only sites from one pirate faction. So if you are in a Sansha or Gurista area, you'll only have the best sites. There are less "useless" sigs to scan (less wormholes and gas sites, no sleeper sites).
---
If you are member of the alliance, which owns the space there, exploration in Null is safer than in wormholes and more profitable. If it's not your home, it is still more profitable, but also more dangerous. Its usually very easy to go from a WH to some station in high- or lowsec, drop off loot and come back. From hostile null you'll usually have to dodge some gatecamps on the way in and out (or go through wormholes, which is more work, but usually much safer).
---
What if they don't have one

Change perspective, adapt.
---
For starters, forget about plexing. Just buy the sub, it's just 15 bucks.
---
Any money you grind ingame you grind for ships. I recommend afk VNI ratting.
---
1-3 hours is enough to enjoy the game.
---
You don't have to give it up. Always bookmark the wormholes you are passing on both sites. If you have a significant amount of loot, simply leave, drop it at the next station, then come back and do more sites.
---
Once you are done, you should use a different frigate to transport your loot to the market (probably Jita): You want a frigate with an align time below 2 seconds (e.g. a Slasher or Atron with nanofibers in the low slots). These are much harder to gank. But even with these safer ships: Never undock with more than 1/3 of your total assets. The risk is quite low, but you may still die.
---
Is this a meme post? Because I am not sure.
---

---
It's important to take into account the cost of the drones as well. How many faction heavies / mediums can you buy for a single Gecko?
---
So *that's* why they fired the community team..
---
He was community manager for Sparc
---
He was caught in an undercover sting operation. You're absolutely right, but if somehow he's innocent, gotta wonder how he ended up in the middle of it all.
---
Yep
---
I wouldn't recommend rapid lights for pve, as the reload time is too long. Even though the application is better you can still switch between precision (or javelins can't remember which one they're called), caldari navy and rage missiles depending on how big targets you're shooting at.
---
Also like pointed in another reply you could fit target painter or even rigor rig to increase the application, although these do make you compromise tank for dps.
---
The drake can also lauch drones, so you could use light drones to take down the frigates while keeping your missiles for the bigger targets. 
---
I’ve never plexed, and happy to pay.  
---
I think it may just be adjusting my expectations.
---
Thanks for the reply.

The Astra linked died in November. You attempt a far-fetched spin here..

Freighting 101: Split cargo shipments
---
Abyssal Sites in frigates... like 20 mil ticks for shit skilled pilots.... and it’s more fun than VNI ratting. 
---
For whatever odd reason , I found the more new players lose at first ..... the more hooked they become. 
---
That pain you felt when they destroyed your shit n stole from you doesn't feel anywhere near as the adrenaline soaked goodness of **YOU BECOMING THE HUNTER . NO GAME EVER WILL MATCH THE THRILL OF THE HUNT IN EVE**
---
Anyways to answer your question here's how I ALWAYS deal with my ISK loss........... WORKS 100% 
---
I go to work ...... I work approx 1 hr ........... take the pay from that 1 measly hour and convert it into and then sell PLEX for  ISK on market............... and BOOM, 3 Billion isk an hour! Fly 100 ships to their death n enjoy every damn sweaty palm adrenaline soaked minute ! 
---
I had a similar experince with a hauler pre drop off change. 
---
I had arranged several contracts to the same system with fair rewards and  standard 1 bill collateral. Anyway I forwarded all the contracts onto the same guy in local. One I picked the wrong station and instead of a free port it was a nill access private azbel so unlikely he was ever going to get access. 
---
I was about to message him saying don't worry just trade window me the stuff back as it's worth a bill to me for avoiding an inconvenience. Before I could he went on a rage about me being a scammer and other bullshit.
---
Once he failed the day contract I took the bill and bounty him knowing that this would pretty much kill his freighter char. He was afk for a week came back and I got a message about his gank. Not seen him since.
---
Well that was probably like the eighth time he got killed that night.....
---
Just set shaders to medium in the graphics options.
---
Wrong place, wrong time. 
---
He was just delivering food. (A dick in a box... local delicacy) 
---
I didn't know food could be delivered via texting an undercover disguised as an underaged minor
---
So he should be a shit player in hopes that some marginally less shit player donates him some isk?  
---
When a game becomes successful the effort shifts from trying to make a good game and improve it to "how do we monetize our product as much as we can".
---
total stupidity
---
so wormholers are the new cool thing ?
---
Totally fine not giving him anything...but to play devil's advocate, he might have just lost everything he was grinding for by being ganked. So maybe that's why he was salty. 
---
Why would sex be odd, it's a perfectly natural thing princess, through all walks of the animal kingdom. I know you're a child but you don't have to be embarrassed by it. It's okay to not understand something. 
---
I'm a 15 day old noobie and lost 2 ships already. The first was no big deal, just Venture loaded with Omber. The second one stung a bit more. Just picked up a new Praxis (paid 94 million ISK) and lost it before I could get it home to outfit it as a mining rig. I could have been a bit more patient in getting it transported home. I just thought I baited them away with a cheap ship I was using to test the water before initiating a jump in the empty Praxis.
---
Thing is that you made 70 million in 3 hours. So what you really lost was 3 hours. My Praxis was more like three 14 hour days for me. You just have to take these losses and plan around them in the future. Eve is ruthless. Just take it as part of the challenge.

Official press release, his name is #2 on the list if you scroll down.   
---
Unfortunately unless there is a severe amount of bizarre circumstances he's probably guilty.  
---
Hoping that this was the first time and he got caught before he could do any permanent damage to a minor. Hopefully he can also get the professional help he needs to rebuild his life and sort himself out.
---
&gt;I have been playing eve for 4 days, made 117 million, then today earned almost 70 million
---
ok, stop right there. you are incredibly rich for the amount of time you've been playing, when i was new i would be mining veldspar in my venture for a few million per hour (if that) because i didn't know any better. so i wouldn't worry too much about losing three hours of work
---
so you are someone who shoots holes in worms?
---
That was a Heron... In terms of exploration it doesnt get much cheaper.
---
go back to Version 1, no captitals, no sov, no tracking, no stacking penalty ;-)
---
I'll one-up you: I never even played Eve, I'm just here for the drama.
---
Don´t forget:
---
\- no stacking penalties
---
\- no tracking
---
\- as many small drones as your bandwith can support
---
It was a joint investigation between Khanid Border Patrol and Aridian Police.

You mean the old ones, or the new ones?

Drakes are a solid and cheap choice for C2 sites, here's an example fit:
---
[Drake, Drake C1 - C2]
---
Damage Control II
---
Ballistic Control System II
---
Adaptive Invulnerability Field II
---
Large Shield Extender II
---
10MN Afterburner II
---
'Arbalest' Heavy Missile Launcher
---
Core Probe Launcher I
---
Medium Core Defense Field Purger I
---
Hobgoblin II x5
---
Caldari Navy Scourge Heavy Missile x1216
---
That should tank everything in a C2 site well, if your skills are low you can drop a mobile depot and refit for more tank with shield flux coils, but you really shouldn't need. You can also swap out the AB for a target painter to help pull aggro from your drones.
---
A 100mn Vexor does work but if your skills are not great you can find difficulty managing the incoming dps, also the sleepers love to chew through drones when you're not looking.
---
A Gila is a great choice if you can fly it as it does incredible dps and also tanks like a beast, although a significantly higher cost for the hull &amp; fit.
---
Fly what you can afford to lose, WH space is spooky o7.
---

If you've been playing for 4 days, you shouldn't really be in wormholes. They're content meant for players who are a bit more advanced. I know the payout is high, but the losses tend to be too. In addition, Eve isn't like other games, when you screw up it really hurts and there are consequences. It's something you get used to and one of the reasons the game is so rewarding to play.
---
i lost a carrier to a frigate because i activated self destruct. I thougt that wouldn't generate a killmail. A corpmate made fun of me and i stopped playing for 6 months. Now i loose mainly vnis. It doesn't bother me that much. I make 12 b a month an loose maybe 2 vnis a month. Don't be sad if you loose a ship. Just get a new ship and try again. Ships are amunition. Don't fly what you can't afford to loose. The question isn't if you loose your stuff but when. Prepare for the day you will loose your stuff and your loss won't hurt that much.
---
Honestly dont waste your time on the shitshow that is r/evejobs.
---
Go in game and join the English recruitment channel. Just spam an advert of what you are looking for and what you can offer.
---
There will be plenty of people spamming their corp adverts as well. Any that look interesting or any offers you get be sure to do your due diligence and investigate them. Have conversations with their recruiters, have a voice chat with them. You can say never mind or no at anytime.
---
That being said, my Alliance's newbro corp would be interested in hearing from you. You will get a PM shortly
---
1. This feature was added to give some (although cryptic) lore on the Triglavians. Nothing of ISK value can be gained from this.
---
2. Convert extra time in extra loot. Worth doing if you are running expensive filaments.
---
3. The drifter spawn in T4s (1 BS &amp; 5+ cruisers that scram, web and neut) is lethal to ab fits. You need either a mwd to kite the cruisers or a massive tank to survive it.
---
4. Tech I blueprints can be invented to Tech II BPCs. Same goes for the ammo BPCs. The BPCs for meta mods seem to be useless because those mods themselves dropped in the early days before they were patched to drop BPCs.

Turns out being in a Reddit alliance does not mean you know how to post.

While there is a chance that he is innocent, it is rather unlikely in this particular case.

I believe the Stratios was one of the few ships were using Subverted drones was the best dps. Haven't tried this myself though.

Or maybe "Happy birthday chat", not sure

While theoretical possibility, not really in this case as they arrested people who all had arranged to meet up with a minor. Reading more than headline helps, you know.

Is carriers/supers have a drone control range bonus? There is no such info not ingame nor in [support.eveonline.com](https://support.eveonline.com). I check ship stats in pyfa ([https://i.imgur.com/qNW6eMK.png](https://i.imgur.com/qNW6eMK.png)) - 60km. I think this is ridiculously low range due to sensor array targeting range bonus, so, what the truth?
---
Not sure if real or ramblings of mad man
---
Nah, better to write the guy off as an ungrateful twat. 
---
And then cry about it on reddit. Works everytime! 
---
Makes more sense if it was some meter maid skin or perhaps a mall cop skin.  The real cops end up blowing those catalysts up minutes later.
---
C5 groups are starting to realize that having two statics is actually a powerful way to expand your corps capabilities and allow for more breathing room for your members, but they want more people to directly roll into to collect their feed taxes. There's nothing wrong with c4s, but it's similar to how nullsec alliances try to scoop up newbros.
---
They want more people at the bottom of *their* totem pole so they have more available content and resources. It's the smarter way to play for people in their position, but it doesn't mean anything for anyone else unless you let them convince you it does. 
---
as a 100m/3 Drone bay, the best theoretical DPS out of stratios is actually the new Subverted JVN drones. 
---
Omni damage is quite nice for not getting countered by a T2 resist profile (1 less thing to think about)
---
Another good thing about geckos is they track small ships much better than heavy drones.

Granted i an in a null bloc but I'm not interested in null politics i just like the content and infrastructure it provides. This is on a different account but the naming is the same style it wouldn't be hard to figure out who my main is. 
---
Well when rorquals are the only rly catchable things this is what happens. Not like roaming the average region will give you much small gang content. People usually dock up and wait. Not talking Delve or Eso here. You have to catch something so the defenders form for your gang. When a rorqual is tackled by a gang its usually not to kill the rorqual but to initiate a response to actually get some frags. When this response is a cap fleet or a 50men ferox fleet of course these trash nano idiots run away. In the end they just want to play the game their way same as you want to play the game your way.
---
The fault here is on the side of ccp. The defensive capabilities of a rorqual give the defenders so much time to react in a organised manner that bridging a proper fleet or caps in is easy and of course default. If the response would have to be in multiple phases where the first phase is also a quick (asap) formed small gang defense this whole thing would be more fun but ye it isnt...for both sides. 
---
reeeeeeported for doxing
---
hmm!?
---
I imagine since you're using anecdotal evidence that you probably used a similar situation yeah? So your friend also made plans with someone who was undercover pretending to be a minor, and then got busted once they met up with the "minor" who they had objectively been making plans to meet up with?
---
What kind of sad world do you live in where they use a trap to catch pedophiles and your response is "fuck the media man I hope this guy gets out of this staged thing he's innocent of" because your friend got wrapped up in a drug sting most likely, lmao. 
---
1.  Oh god you are about to trigger that dumb cease and desist legalese letter meme from a few months ago.  But seriously, writing up NIPs and other diplomatic agreements for a corp is perfect for that.
---
2. I know of a drug Lord that does pretty well for himself and practically has a monopoly in my regions.
---
3. A sexy deathglow Gila skin.
---
4. Probably not if it's a newbie corp like Horde or Brave. Spais exist and recruiters will do background checks in you so yes it may come up... but don't be a spai and you'll be fine.   Or be one and just be good at it.     But I'd actually prefer people try different corps out to find the right fit.
---
Fuck my krabbing alt I'm going to kick his fucking teeth in if he misses his next payment.

You're right though I should upgrade. But I'd end up buying 9 skiffs, one for each location so I don't have to move them between all the systems. I'm just cheap and lazy I guess. 
---
You know generally speaking, people project pretty heavily online. So, it's not unlikely that someone who complains that anything they say should be supported because they're "anti pedophile" is probably fucked up and a piece of shit pedo themselves. Just an observation though, tends to happen. I'm sure not in your case, though. 
---
&gt;One of the most appealing parts of the game for me is being able to play whatever role you want to, is there any place for attorneys in game? Obviously, I doubt there would be anything like civil lawsuits, but something in the realm of contract drafting, M/A, or IP?
---
There are no big RP communities right now
---
&gt;On the other side of the profession spectrum, is drug manufacturing and drug running profitable?
---
Yes. but like everything, there will always be someone bigger, and richer, which can afford smaller profit margins. There's not really any "OP" may to get isk, find something you like
---
&gt;What are you wearing right now?
---
Just woke up so nothing
---
&gt;And, will I pidgen hole myself in a particular alliance? I.e. If I joined Pandemic Horde, would that necessarily preclude me from joining another major alliance later on down the road?
---
No, but it depends. Goonswarm or TEST recruiters may think you're a spy if you have no killboard activity and a few days in horde only. But in the end most vets have been on every side in eve 
---
Because when he met with this person, he had no prior knowledge of the person's age.
---
I mean, I saw the evidence.  He was on his way to pick up this person to grab a meal.  On his way, that's when she disclosed her age.  He canceled and turned around and headed back towards his house.  The police stopped in on the highway and arrested him, kept him in custody for 4 months.
---
It took years for the judge to determine that it was textbook entrapment and to assume entrapment never happens is blind faith in the judicial system.
---
Its a catch 22, if you lock them away for seeking help they do not seek help and harm kids, its kinda fucked but I understand nobody wants these people near them but it may be counter productive.
---
Keep practicing and getting those skills up. 200mil/hr is easily doable exploring null once you get the hang of it. 
---
&gt; probably guilty
---
I like to think we should give other people the benefit of the doubt just as we would like to have the benefit of the doubt given to us in return (I think it's the Golden Rule, or something like that).  
---
This is newsworthy but I would wait for a jury to conclude based on the actual evidence and more than 5 seconds of vacillation before commenting further.
---
Why care?  
---
Money is just a means to an end in this game.
---
It's not really that important. The fun is what's important.
---
&gt;Give nullsec relic sites a go.... some regions are empty....
---
ggggggaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
---
remove panic
---
We would just keep supers and Titans near the rorquals...
---
People ski injecting into condor is the real cancer killing Eve. 
---
Always used to use Geckos. Now I'm flying with the Subverted. 
---
You know, you're right... I agree training is a bad bit of game design. We should all be titan pilots if we want to on our first day. I want to be a perfect miner and combat pilot as well as explorer and all I should have to do is inject the skills I purchase on the market. Fuck all those people who trained for years to get where they are now. I'm new, I'm entitled, and I want it NOW!

I think you didn t understand his midset at the time. He wasn t angry at you, he was angry before and his mind was set to recover as much as possible. He probably didn t know that you were gona give him more. I think alot of people forget how tuff this game is for a beginner. It is so much information and people giving you advice contradict each other.  Alot of players don t look for a corp straight away that would help them with  finding a way to make Isk, affording all the skillbooks you need to buy. They are overwhelmed by the possabilities in EVE, get scammed and ganked by people who you have no chance of fighting because of skills and fitting.. I find it very sad that so many here hope you ganked him. Making newbies leave the game helps noone. It s just less content for everyone and a sooner end to this game we all love.

This exactly.  as a new explorer, you need to do the mental gymnastics to separate cargo on an exploration trip from net worth, otherwise it might get discouraging realizing you just lost 40% of your net worth.  On the otherhand - you took a shot at making 70m and died.
---
Thing about JF,  I always assumed, was to have Nomads, TTU (Total Time Undocked) being the key factor in whether or not you're going to die horribly.
---
So you mean to tell me, that you are projecting now and you are a pedophile?

 Are you surprised? EVE is full of psychopaths why would those working on development be any better? 
---
&gt; That doesn't mean there's no way to blow people out of their homes, but it makes fighting the residents a little harder because you may have to contest with ten FAXs, which most conventional fleets won't break.
---
Honestly I don't see a lot of the mains C4's group dropping caps (except for eviction ofc ).
---
It wasn't so long ago that they were accidentally removed because of some technical glitch, resulting in a simple "Region" under the description. In typical CCP fashion they left it like that for a good year or so. :|
---

That said, I would like to see something in a similar vein for various systems as well... it's the little things.

C4 with a C3/C2 are great for newbie friendly corp.

We live a C4-C4-C5 and some times i wish we'd have a C3/C2 so it's more isk fiendly for newbies but on the other hand i don't know if I would want to get rid of the C4 or the C5 ^^

Yeah, but you should've seen how the news blasted him on television.  It was so bad it was almost fucking hilarious because what the media was telling people was complete lies.
---
You seem to be unable to distinguish actual progressives from the mass of pedos who are trying to hijack the LGBT+ acronym to include pedophilia. Any "leftist" trying to legalize pedophilia is like 95% certain to be a pedophile themselves, with the other 5% being various forms of braindead
---
media was also probably fed lies by the arresting officers.

The guy literally went backwards in the video game industry, of course something was fishy.

Yes, but it's the medias responsibility to verify what they say.  They announced the news before charges were even given to him or before he went to his first hearing.

Is it possible, that you simply want to censore anything that is positioned to the right from Stalin itself because its a pathetic gasp of air for visibility with political views that kill brain cells at the same time? Just asking comrade. Nothing serious. You know just words.

As someone who is about to sit for the bar and specialized in IP that letter made me cringe. After  a quick 15 second read... A loadout is hardly proper subject matter for trademark law, rather it is more likely copyright or patent (depending on whether you claim it as pixels or a useful invention). Moreover, even if it was a proper mark, a dilution argument is only valid under a famous mark

you guys just fly the really gay ones, no credit deserved

You seem to be unable to distinguish the word "many" from "all"

Ever heard about “hi, can you help me test my tank?”.

Doing convo first does not provide any trustworthyness.

Or perhaps saying "many" in that context comes across like saying "most"

So let me get this straight.. a subcapital force fought a capital/sub mix and won? I dont believe it #NerfCaps. #Sarcasm

Brawly condors have their merits, kiting is the way forward =D

Yet all of their kills are made by camping stargates... Because that's not gay at all.

Thanks!

hum ok, never used the subverted drones (really high price compared to the ship itself but i can try it once or twice). Tracking should'nt be a problem on a webbed/scrammed target but are those drones good to catch cruisers size targets for example ? 
---
go out and gatecamp in delve like them then

Back in the day I used to day-trip into WH in a rather blingy fit Legion.  I would earn a few hundred mil in a few hours.  All the while I was there I was expecting to get dropped/die, i.e. I was rolling a dice.  That's part of what made it kind-of exciting.  
---
These days in Eve WH are more highly populated not just with WH corps and people who live there but with people "just passing through" looking for content (you are their content).  So I wouldn't day-trip.
---
Your best bet is to join a nullsec corp if you want to earn safely.  You can earn hundreds of millions just looting and salvaging the wrecks of super pilots, for example.
---
That game progression is the same as mine, just over a longer period. Keep wanting to check out Empyrion and Elite again but Eve is keeping me satisfied.

Just leave them be. We know that the whole internet is in the hands of liberal leftist commies. Thats why they censor, downvote and delete everything if its even remotely connected to the truth. The brainwashing is strong with these people. They are so tolerant, they absolutely can not tolerate anything different than the viewpoint of their safe spaces and echochambers. So in your case many means all, or most. Because words dont matter for them either. 
---
most alliances are not restricted or "force" you to go on fleets. Just be part of the group you are in and participate when you can and are avaiable. It's just a game and RL is always priority. Corps and alliances need the effort of every member in lots of diferent aspects, not just regular F1 pusher. If you can help your corp/alliance when you are online, in my experience you will always be welcome. 
---
But what about the only named system in Providence?

I've asked myself the same thing. Nobody gives a fuck or a meme about it. :(

You lost 300k not 70 mil. Things you loot are not yours till you sold it.

CCP : Collecting Child Porn
---
Why would we? 
---
Or bullets.
---
Definitely get all trade related skills!!!
---
My method is to have as many buy / sell orders as possible that have a decent profit margin &amp; volume. Some will get over / under cut and some won't. If you have over 100 orders some are bound to transact. I try to avoid items which already have tonnes of people fighting for them.
---
No single item is making a killing, but altogether they add up to a decent profit. Enough to fund my more nefarious activities.
---
I don't really look into it that deeply. I've heard some people look at kill boards to see which weapons / modules are being destroyed a lot and try to buy those items up or maybe even haul those items to stations near where wars are being waged.
---
It can be a tedious task updating all your orders when they keep getting beaten which is why you should spread your orders across as many item types as you can.

I learnt so much from his videos in my early days of playing eve.  
---
What is this fixed you speak of? Are you suggesting that a change was made to the game that broke something needlessly, and the problem it created has gone unresolved for a long period of time? Get out of here with that nonsense!

Seriously though I'd be surprised if it gets looked at this year, if at all.

Hey guys,
---
Everyone at CCP Games is shocked and appalled to hear the news regarding Thomas Cheung, who worked with us as a VR Community contractor from Jan - Nov 2017. 
---
We consider this behavior to be completely abhorrent, and are reassured that the authorities have taken the appropriate action.  
---
Do you honestly think that nerfing cynos, removing PANIC or any other solution(that proposes to cripple the defenders) would change anything? Just think about every solution proposed by the attackers. If they are implemented, knowing eve mindset, we would just stay with super/fax/Titan alts near the rorquals.
---
We need to think outside this little box. I'm not proposing anything because I really don't have one miracle idea right now. 
---
Happy cake dayyyy!!!! 
---
Maybe you are just underestimating the code thing. I know you can replace foundations and we have planned it for our old house so - without being an engineer/architect - I´d say it´s possible. The code rewriting though seems to be next to impossible. :D

are....are you dumb?
---
There's three types of newbros that I come across in wormhole space when you gank them. 
---
- The dude that gets angry at you, spews shit in local at you, sends mails and is over all a jackass about it.
---
- The dude that stays quiet.
---
- The dude that asks how, why and how to avoid it next time and takes advice.
---
The former, is usually an alt or seems to feel like it. Generally always stays salty and wont stick around too long.
---
The latter, sticks around for a while, learns and if they join your group, tend to be active and all round decent person. 
---
The JF pilot is actually a horde pilot.
---
That's the only sure cure for pedophilia.
---
Carriers don't use drones, they use fighters, so the drone targeting range isn't a factor. Fighters can fly anywhere on grid and attack anything you lock up (even thousands of kilometers away).
---
Lmao i was on a cruise with him literally two months ago rip fuckin idiot
---
You're actually fucking retarded holy shit stay in your autism chamber where you have to scan your dick before you can take a piss. Wormholers are untermensch confirmed

Ok cleaning my screen and getting new coffe now.

Damn you

extracted one last time; from this world ;_;

Who are those FBI Agents around the net then?

Let him be, a little man with a big ego is merely amusement to the wise.
---
I was downvoted on the wow sub for posting this, honestly not surprised to see EVE players having more brain than wow players.
---
We too, people also are aware that his action have no relation to CCP or EVE.         
---
We know that CCP didn't knew about it.                  
---
TBH i have no fucking idea why this is getting so much attention here ... like WTF **trolling on /r/eve is one thing** but trolling about this kind of stuff is simply sick.                       
---
Completely agree, but at the same time, if we accept that premise, we must also accept that we'll have the chance call him a disgusting pedo once he's convicted.
---
that wanted to supply his KF Rorqual alts lol ...
---
Even better, you could utilized what he did on the Waterloo station to simulate a gatecamp so you get another route to your destination.
---
Isnt CVA sort of RP tho ? 
---
Olmeca believes in catch and release. It's the right thing to do.
---
Is there a good resource site for relic sites and how to profit from them? Looking for recommended skills, ships and fits, tips and tricks and such. I’ve found a few YouTube videos but nothing very recent or all inclusive. 
---
I think its the fact that it hits so close to home. The game dev world is not huge so lots of people will remember being in contact with this individual. Regardless, as Falcon stated, its great to know these rings are facing the full extent of the law.
---
used to be at least, don't think there is much left

Welcome to EVE to answer your questions:
---
1. No
---
2. Not really
---
3. Yeezys
---
4. Not really
---
Wow. The discussion was about alternative solutions to removing local and by extension leveling the playing field with botters but yeah get good is a great contribution to the thread. Thanks!
---
why dont u try getting a boner
---
Usually kids.
---
The circle is complete.
---
lol k
---
So much for talking like an adult huh.
---
Bring more ecm ships. Of course debilitating ships will be primaried. And bring more damage. Caracas are a nightmare of tighter. And cant ecm fighters is bullshit you can.
---
And uhhh empire assets such as titans and supers and your small gang which is apparently trash, that wants to kill them or if not than their fighters.
---
Defanging carriers happens all the time. When small gang blips drop on them the fighters are first to go and that's small gang as fuck. As far as being able to tackle subs it can tackle anything/the remote bubble works as intended.
---
Fighters having that ability does not at all surprise me as any scientist in that world would want that. What's more they are heavily limited by what they can bring.m with them. Either Amway you need to either bring more or get better. 
---
Be a man. If you want to Swag on miners, use Polarised Comets.
---
Find a small group that caters to a casual playstyle? There are plenty of them out there including my own for lowsec. Just look at the eve recruitment forums and /r/evejobs to see what is out there.
---
&gt;But you also had fewer enemies with high sp. if you started 10 years ago you were at most 6 years of sp behind a day 1 character. And a much larger proportion of the player base would have been relatively new.
---
The entitled brat is you.

It's pretty much all doxx at this point, especially on Twitter.

You want to execute people with a mental illness?  
---
Oh boy.
---
He looks like he would do that sort of thing. 
---
It's name and shame. Unfortunate that CCP and Eve are dragged into it, but might as well plaster his face everywhere for it.
---
I sometimes do, but even if its a 2day old char, i assume its probably someones alt.  
---
Led me to actually kill a newbro a few days ago. Kinda felt bad, and sent him 10 times the isk his boat was worth, and an ingame mail giving one or two hints how to prevent getting blapped like that in the future.  
---
Was admirable, he replied with "its ok, no problem".  
---
Plenty of people do shoot newbros, but theres also a good amount of people that afterwards talk to that newbro, give him hints and stuff.
---
fuckin YIKES
---
EVE has a lot of lessons for real life (INB4 EVE is life). Don't fly what you can't afford to lose... I have seen grown men brought to tears after dropping a new iPhone.
---
Corollary to "don't fly what you can't afford to lose": a cheap ship can eventually fill with sufficient loot that it becomes unaffordable to lose.
---
I can only assume you've never actually been to any of those fights.
---
They're miserable.
---
There's one I haven't seen in a while.
---
This is like Brexit. \*gets popcorn\*

I remember when getting 20mil to buy my first BS seemed like an impossible task.

Wtf get help.

---
Loot fairy was like "yeah I'm DTF"
---
He might be, but at least he doesn’t stutter. 
---
probably followed the "don't fly what you can't afford to lose" rule of eve
---
I just rebuy everything and go die again
---
That cant be done as alfa?
---
Damn.
---
No,not omega yet, i am doing wormholes to earn enough to buy omega (price for 500 plex is currently 1,8 bil) while in the mean time training all alfa skills i can. My plan was to buy omega in a month.
---
So being a wormholer is EVE Crossfit?
---
To be fair League has always catered to casuals
---
Gecko's are like 90m isk a pop currently versus the ~5m isk you are probably paying for your 3+2 set. So is the difference worth 175m isk to you? 
---
Blame CCP.
---
i dont know why you would delete ur post but still respond to my comment...
---
&gt;There are no big RP communities right now
---
There is a roleplaying community, there's even an official forum for it.
---
My motto to new players are. Its pixels in space. As long as you enjoyed it up to the point of being blown up then keep going. Yes you lost 70 mil. People lose titans worth 250bil. As long as you can replace your fun aka the ship. Its worth it.
---
It's still around. RPers tend to drive a good amount of the story around Drifters and probably Triglavians in the future.
---
That’s what you are trying to get with your said brained crying and whining- learn like the rest of us and figure out how dreads work you scrub level shit.
---
....and yet here you are, commenting.
---
&gt;You could invest all that money in intact armor plates let’s say and you would’ve made 1,8bil profit way faster and less risky
---
I see you're selling intact armor plates.
---
"Its not that hard to WH, just come out once a month, makes tons of esk" WHer btw.
---
Tasteless lmao
---
I’m pretty sure you can just put those up for sell in NPC Delve and they will disappear.

So basically a black ops gang decloced next to him when he tried to blap that noob ?

This shit is everywhere.

He may well face a trial. Commenting this way is a good way of prejudicing the trial.

That’s one thing :p

I sell them but really it was the first good example that came out from the top of my mind :D
---
spicy
---
i am sorry but from your post i am only hearing your kind happy voice saying: 
---
\- I learnt how it is to travel in a whole
---
\- i learnt how to make money from it 
---
\- i learnt not to stay in that spot if i am being scanned down --&gt; create safes and warp around them if needed while scanning 
---
\- i learnt about big(er) losses 
---
\- i am now much better prepared for the next encounter :) 
---
now let me tell you my noob story: 
---
did some explo, made some moneyz, first big moneyz,  almost a months worth of sub (more than 1 bill) 
---
totally prepare a invulnerable uncatchable ship --&gt; astero which is in fact a (paper thin) frigate.
---
bling it to the point it costed almost all my isk cause nobody was gonna catch it anyway (cause i had the isk)
---
i am even using a zeugma analyzer which is smth like 250 mil itself. 
---
started using it and getting back richer again
---
one day i find a serpentis something site. i open the first can. i open the second can. the third. 
---
4th can.. and it exploded. not the can but my ship did. 
---
was totally not aware that some named sites have rats. they have a very short timer (like 1-2 mins) and then a whole army of uber strong rats spawns. 
---
spent half a month's sub worth of isk on a ship which thought me that. i would've learnt that with 300 k too.  
---
1 year later, i am wandering around in my null pocket, bookmarking wholes for my corp 
---
i find a similar site and bookmark it. neut enters the system in blingy stratios. he starts scanning down the one anom in the system 
---
i give the dude a bit of time to scan it down, i warp to the site - start the timer - cloak away. 
---
dude pins it, warps to the site, the moment he aproaches the first can i uncloak and point him. we both get ships torn down to pieces cause rats were just warping in before he even locked the first can. 
---
i undock two systems away and 2 mins later i am looting his wreck for 1 bil isk. 
---
i even get a zeugma analyzer from it. 
---
circle of eve is now complete. 
---
now take back that 300 k ship and make another 100 mil with it, the more you learn the faster you will make it :D in a couple of weeks you will be able to do that isk at least **daily** in your 300 k ship (and you will still lose cargos of 100 mils). 
---
This is toxic
---
Maybe, imagine that null sec is totally empty apart from the NPC regions, like, no gates, you only get there from a WH and then you can build gates to them. That would at least shrink the map for a while.
---
Mmhm.  
---
Dude I'm just busting your balls lol. tbh though the only reason I stay away from trading is it's the only thing where you really can't trust the advice people give you with regards to their motives. If someone makes a guide on how to do L5s, it's not likely he's going to camp the list of recommended systems lol.
---
top notch execution and awesome utilization of the stukas with mjd and bomb there.
---
muninn fc made some mistakes it seems and pando did rly well here.
---
still this boosh thing needs fixing. A situation like this were bombers (squishy high dps gank ship) perform that well needs adjustment wow
---
I respect your beliefs and I’m sorry I offended you...
---
It's a stage 2 cancer of the brain
---
heh faggot
---
I'm wormholer btw
---
I just spend most of my time running around in our standing fleet when I’m busy, so that I can just dock up and go afk whenever I need to, and then undock and still have stuff going on. 
---
Helped me a lot too back when I 1st got into eve.  I miss his voice now. :p
---
I've logged in one of my alpha pilots, and it had 5.5 million skill points.   Never omega-ed it.  Didn't inject bonus training either. 
---
How would you tackle a super with this comp??
---
Rule 1 is not at all this. Rule 1 is 'don't spend your isk on a ship/fit that you cannot afford to lose'. He flew a 300k ship, he could afford to lose it just fine, it was the cargo on the way that he was sad about losing.

This was intentional, hence it being closed out in bug reports. Too lazy to find the blogpost (it might’ve even just been a CCP reddit comment) but it’s Not A Bug Its A Feature (tm)
---
If they are paying for a sub, they are subsidizing the game.
---
Gotta agree with you. There's a serious problem in the UK media of suspects being blazoned in headlines, with some of them going on to be cleared.
---
I'm completely for people who are convicted of crimes being names and shamed, and for public to be warned, but putting out the names of suspects ruins the lives of those that turn out to be innocent.
---
This is bogus. Commenting in absolutely every way on reddit will not prejudice it. Plus, dude, have you seen the twitter? 
---
I'd rather pay extra to move now than wait. Atleast paying more effects the game in more ways than just sitting around

My current corp takes 10% of the derived mineral value assuming perfect reprocessing.
---
Ore prices are gamed pretty easily in Jita, mineral values are pretty solid. I would say adjust it to whatever your best reprocessing is though, im in deep null where we get the highest.  
---
How much can you make aprox?
---
I like the idea that the farther from home that you try to project force, the bigger risk you’re taking in not getting home. It let’s little groups firmly control a small area and makes it riskier for big groups to sprawl. Fuel trucks obvious reduce the problem, but as you said, then they have more logistics and put those ships at risk. The details would be important, but the principle seems good. 
---
Have to say, it was borderline to leave this post up. It's not really relevant to EVE or CCP, but at the same time people like to follow Ex-Devs so I guess it's tenuously related.

Thankfully comments have been mostly ok so far, if it gets out of hand the thread will just get locked.

Well an older player goes and talks to some noob and offers free money. I would be suspicious!
---
Deal seems to have vanished. It was there this morning, I settled down to do some work and now it is no more...
---
Ummm you said it yourself you posted it in the wrong sub...why did you make it about yourself..your not a victim if someone enforces the rules..
---
I joined a fleet and pressed F1 a lot.
---
&gt; abyss conten
---
Hah tried that , fairly easy the 1rst level, but wasn't watching the clock, Doh, so lost the ship while bumming around the wrecks.....
---
If your moving a fleet that may require a fuel truck and you can't protect it should you be moving that fleet? Plus I wouldn't be able to contain my laughter if the fuel trucks got ganked. But in all reality with current tethering and citadels this shouldn't be an issue. Plus EVERYONE in eve is already trained into a rorq at this point and now you would be praised for bringing your rorqs on deployment :)
---
I have definitely been concorded for shooting a wreck! 
---
TBH you should lock this thread.         
---
/r/eve is about game and not sick dude and his actions ....         
---
All the good ones are. Leshak / Drekavac / Kikimora.
---
Makes sense, and is similar to what I do I guess, I was just being lazy and using the estimated value. I'll have to whip up a spreadsheet to do the mineral values.
---
welcome to eve
---
omg thank you for that.  aaahhh holy shit take an updoot
---
Per hour or week?
---
Per hour, with optimization it's maybe 2 sites an hour (with one dread), so say 1b tops. Might be more, never done a solo dread myself.
---
Per week, while it varies, you'll usually get 10-15 sites. If you move wormholes, that's obviously irrelevant. 
---
For WR, which one is better?
---
Cormac McCarthy is a grim sonofabitch. Man needs a hug.
---
Who cares. WR is, for you, just buffer. You're actively repping, so what use is buffer? 
---
Moros is probably better for c5's because of tracking though. 
---
The editing with voice and stuff is really cool, keep this up !
---
I recommend both of them,empyrion is however extremely satisfying.i always frrwmee of option to walk inside vehicles, in empyrion it is possible. I made a hover bike,tank,space jet and capital ship. I  can walk inside both tank and capital ship,and can fit all 3 vehicles inside capital and bring them on other planets and solar systems. Buy empyrion, its very worth it.

Hey there, my name is Johnny Pew, in game character name : sir Livingston..

Aah THAT intro

---
After years of wandering in the wilderness not knowing where I belong I've realised I belong in the wilderness, but cloaked.
---
Stealth is the life for me.
---
I may never uncloak again.
---
Because if I had not specified WR the answer would have been Nagflar ;)
---
Thanks for the insight
---
Actually it was just where we caught most things. Who’d have thunk best place to grab things is a gate 
---
His dialogue is definitely a job to read but I think he's worth the effort.
---
" this boosh thing needs fixing "
---
why? its works fine so far 
---
So you would say Moros &gt; nag &gt; rev &gt; pheonix ?
---
Also I'm currently gathering data about WH, do you have any website or something like this with recent fit for dreads etc ?
---
So you want EVE to go fully pay2win?
---
&gt;entitled 
---
Not sure if you know what that word means. 
---
well that is a9 day old player in eve for ya
---
I can confirm that the condors are hilarious and effective. I think the true secret sauce is in the small neut.
---
The true hero however was FryingTuna Auscent as they were flying the real heart of this fleet, the battle badger.
---
Everyone knows that dozens of keepstars are dying everyday because of OP Ravens/Stukas MJD doctrines...
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Then alliances could just stage massive amounts of fuel in their citadel chains across central new eden and bring alts in inties that can board a DST and bring fuel from said citadel. Don't even need to bring fuel trucks with you. The end result would be the same as pre-phoebe; nobody using capitals in lowsec because if more than a few of them get tackled, a nearby superblob can easily take those 2-3 mids and be there in 15 minutes.
---
Even tho i have no clue who jamal is - still a sad story. 
---
Feel hugged =)
---
Seconding this question, also would like to know.
---
I just dont understand why you just dont call yourselves Legacy. You are Legacy right? not just Test + Pets. 
---
I listened to a ex fbi agent who developed the profiling system for serial killers and pedophiles talk about those vigilante groups who do this and he claimed they ruin more cases then they bring to conviction because they are untrained and their actions ruin a lot of key evidence and the pedo walks. He said they do more harm then good and causes more kids to get abused due to that, he said he couldnt never endorse something that ruins the only case they have on someone forcing them to wait until another victim b4 they get another chance to get em off the street. I was shocked
---
Why do you have Miniluv set red? They only go after overstuffed freighters and the occasional miner.
---
All depends, where are you mining? Hi sec = orca, low sec = porpoise, null = rorqual
---
Same here, still looking for a proxy that is well tested also allow longer tests.      
---
Currently 90% of times no issues on current connection, but when issues starts my rubber banding is insane - to the point i stopped flying on fleets as getting stuck in a ship in a system for 5 minutes is annoying as hell. 
---
Found the pedophile.

---
&gt; trolling about this kind of stuff
---
I don't think OP was trying to put anything on CCP. It's news and about someone who many here may have interacted with.
---
1. Not really. But you could find your skills useful in managing a renting alliance, for example.
---
2. Very. Even synth boosters make you good profit.
---
3. Uniform.
---
4. No. For example I've never left horde after all those years only because i never wanted to leave. I like it here.
---
A quality first post on Reddit.  
---
If he's in the US, If he goes in for child molestation or arranging to have a sexual interaction with a child. Provided he is put in with the general population, it can be assured that the real appropriate punishment will in fact be handed out. 
---
For what it's worth, consider paying the sub directly if that's an option for you, at least for a month or two as you get established.  It's possible to pay a sub off alpha activities, and explo is one of the best as far as profitability and non-grindiness, but dedicating all your game time to paying for your game time can become a vicious cycle.
---
If you're enjoying the explo on its own merits, by all means, continue.  Just don't burn yourself out by over-focusing on PLEX and forgetting to play the game for actual fun.
---
To much edge. put down your phone and get back to your homework kid.  
---
So 3hrs of cargo in your ship: when you grt something valuable you rush to station to leave it there and then keep wormholing
---
Ex-CCP Elvine is in for a good time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJtcbbb29D4
---
I sincerely hope everyone at CCP is ok. I worked at a company a bunch of years ago, and a coworker at the time was arrested by US authorities on a flight that we were all on together for crimes of this nature, and it absolutely sent shock through every one of us. It's really scary when you're this close to something like that, it can have a big effect. I really wish you guys the best, and hopefully you all talk about it so that no one endures any hardship over the revelations.
---
Locking tends to just draw attention to an issue in a negative way. That could very well give the impression to a random passerby that the we are trying to shield CCP from 'embarrassing news' - or something to that effect. The reality is they obviously have 0 responsibility for this guys actions nor should this reflect on them in any way, shape or form - but a random looky-lou isn't going to apply that kind of time to the issue.
---
Instead letting people talk about it demonstrates pretty clearly the Eve community and CCP - at least in this neck of the woods - very clearly condemns this sicko.
---
So like the current meta if you want to stop people from being able to move effectively kill the citadels? If they have fuel for the alliances now they are that much more valuable and have even more reason to kill. And lowsec is already controlled by a couple groups and they drop supers on anything.

Naw, that's only popular in Decatur and Midtown. ;)
---
I wouldn't run dreads in a WR period considering single digits confessors would be able to kill you if rolled into.
---
Yes, you will need to use the mining ledger to keep track of who mines what. The guy with 3 hulks earns more than the guy with 1 venture. Where it gets interesting is figuring out how to tip-out your dedicated mining hauler(s) and/or defense fleet.
---
I use [Windscribe](https://windscribe.com/). It works fairly well and is priced right. Rarely there are some speed and connectivity issues that are easily fixed by switching locations.
---
This guy used to do gold making vids for WoW and also used to stream on Twitch.  I watched him sometimes.  It's creepy af...  
---
Tomy ???        
---
Yep still a thing. VNI bots in ns that align out if a neut enters local and initiate warp if neut shows on grid. Cheers mate
---
terrible detection
---
1) You could join CODE. and mingle with mining permits. Just for roleplay probably, won't earn you isk.
---
You can make contracts but that's mainly a trader's trade.
---
If you're devoted enough to this purpose, join or make a corporation, be in it's leadership and shape it's culture in a way that your lawyer profession is required and payed from corp wallet. Could be considered mostly roleplay too but this time payed.
---
2) Only if you can obtain the materials/blueprints cheaper thsn the market price cause otherwise it's mostly negative profit.
---
You can make isk as an outlaw pirate ganker though you'll probably need more accounts or a gang to do it with. CODE. is easiest to get in but they won't give you the loot.
---
Doing higher tier Abyssal sites is illegal and very lucrative too, but risky and skill intensive
---
3) The cables that connect me to my capsule. My avatar wears a fancy Amarrian costume and overcoat.
---
4) You will still have many options though some alliances might not welcome you, especially at times of war with the alliance you are currently in or left recently. They just fear spies, not hard feelings or anything.
---
Pandemic Horde is one of the alliances that won't have too much negative impact as many new players go there.
---
I use Private Internet Access. I've had it a couple years and it's never given me reason to look for another.
---
Same old same old then :)
---
NordVPN works great for me. 
---
You would think that CCP could develop a tool that hashes your PC when the client is installed and updated, so they wouldn't need to IP ban people who in all likelihood have dynamic IPs to begin with.
---
No one was crying or using insulting language but if thats ur style go ahead. I have the highest regard of the execution that was shown in the video.
---
I just dont think bombers should be ships of the line to head on face to face a HAC fleet and win the engagement with basically 0 losses even tho mistakes were made on the other side. Thats an opinion which I base only on the shown video. It kinda feels very...off
---
To be fair this isn't really relevant to WoW or Blizzard. The reason it's here is because the guy worked for CCP briefly - and even that is kind of shaky at best.
---
Ok thanks &lt;3
---
Never know what you get when you message new players.
---
I often message day old players to chat with them, see where they are strugging, give advice, and patch up places where I think the new player experience is lacking, or send them some ISK to save them some of the early grind. (Also to recruit players into my lowsec sex cult, but unrelated.)  
---
You really get all kinds of responses. Some people are deeply appreciative that you're helping them, some people ignore you (no help for you then), and some people can be paranoid or 'lippy'. 
---
According to Falcon up above he was working on the VR team as a contractor for a couple of months.
---
Doesn't the ledger only show corp members, and only moon mining?
---
I run a double cap battery ab active Gila. So long as you prioritise the neuting rats it's pretty easy at t4. Will even do some t5s avoiding dark and firestorm.
---
&gt;Obviously, I doubt there would be anything like civil lawsuits, but something in the realm of contract drafting, M/A, or IP?
---
You could probably get space-rich if you used your lawyer jargon to entice people to invest in you. It's been a while since the last great heist. They always make for fun news.
---
I got popped in a heron with around as much as you lost when I first started. Damn horde and their gatecamps.  
---
The guy convo'd me afterwards, contracted me my loot, bought me a new heron (which sounded expensive to me at the time hah!), and got me to join a nullsec corp. Granted, it's horde and they accept everyone, I've still had an absolute blast since and learned so much more than I ever would have solo.
---
He didnt?
---
Y'know when the first thing a future wormholer btw asks is how to krab they're warping straight to zkill

Wormholer btw

just compress ore in belt, clear out the belt and move on. don't leave ochre rocks you hurt the respawn timer. If I catch doing that again I Will boson your drones. Yeah I'm talking to you rorq alt

Trust me you have nothing to fear of /u/_thejudge outside of him awoxing you and refusing to SRP.

The guy was an extremely prominent member of the wow community up untill a few years ago.

---
Well, former contractor for a few months who they let go. 
---
Pedophiles come in all shapes, ages, genders and hair colours, in fact it is for more common that they blend in to society better than most and that is how they get away with it for so long.  
---
I don't think it's fair to imply that all adult men who have a non-conventional appearance are more likely to be sexual predator, especially within a community that generally speaking, attracts a lot of people who express themselves through an alternative appearance.
---
Corp members, yes. But ALL mining, even ice and gas. If you are running a mining op with multiple corps, you will need to gather screenshots or something.
---
You can watch me on twitch.tv/dunk_zone
---
I'm legit :-)
---
Honestly, it sucks getting killed, but think about how fun the trip itself was. Scanning down WH chains and exploration sites, it's a thrill at this point in your career. 
---
Keep doing what you're doing and the money will work itself out. You'll lose big and you'll win big. It's all part of EVE. Embrace it and enjoy the feeling you have right now because down the road, when you become well established in EVE and you have your routine and niche all figured out, you'd actually pay a lot more isk just to feel the thrill shakes again.
---
Nice, I thought it was just moons and ignored it for now, thanks man!

Wouldn't it be simpler to just have them contract all the ore they mined to you from your station after the OP for whatever value you set? 
---
Atlanta with the Intl Airport here is such a hotbed for this type of activity and child/sex trafficking. The one news report has the city itself trying to say "Oh they weren't busted in the city". Well its only about 10-15 minutes from Atlanta to Dekalb county, if that. The location is pretty irrelevant that they need to really keep cracking down on these things and the child/sex trafficking coming in/out of my state.
---
I know how shocking it can be when you have a co-worker end up arrested, especially for such a horrible crime. Early in my work career a fellow who I sat next was always taking off to take care of his daughter. Took off one afternoon to pick her up. Saw him that night on the news, busted by an undercover female cop as the "Soap Creek Rapist". She laid out to sunbathe at the local park where he was going after women and when he went to grab her, they nabbed him. Had been arrested for indecent exposure and had all kinds of kidnapping tools in his vehicle. Very scary.
---
_TheJudge won't get his hands dirty
---
True heroes of the people
---
U really have to much free time bro!!
---
Yes, I am fine with that. If the person is not playing the account for the months involved, I do not feel like there is some great injustice that they were not paying for the account while that trained. 
---
Back in the day, before Alpha clones existed and when ghost training was more or less a real thing, I trained dread 5 this way--though to be fair I took a multi-year break between when I deactivated my account and came back. 
---
So no, as a consumer myself I do not feel like I need to force someone to pay for something they aren't using while training a long skill. Again, it does not violate in the slightest my sense of justice. 
---
In fact, I am more bothered by the existence of skill injectors, their impact on the game, their cheapening of the *years* of training I have put into my characters, and the ease at which skill points can be farmed using alpha characters than I am this. 
---
I knew it was you!
---
Didn't he delete/set all his videos private for no apparent reason? Seems a bit odd - you don't have to play the game if you don't want to, but leaving your videos up for people who enjoy them seems like a reasonable thing to do.

Open Can &gt; go to List View (not icon view) &gt; Select all items and Ctrl +C &gt; Paste into [https://evepraisal.com/](https://evepraisal.com/) and pay out a rough -10% of what Jita Buy is (not sell).
---
I used to mine with a few guys that didn't have an Orca, they would paste the evepraisal as the can name when it was full and I would pay them -10% of Jita Buy on every can.
---
it's eve everyone speaks in memes
---
In death, he became what he coveted in life.
---
Maybe, but that would require me to trust someone, and this is Eve.
---
Also they would have to stop mining to put it in the station. Having your lasers always on and being able to use a hulk is a large benefit in a mining op.
---
evepraisal is a good idea! Nearly as easy as the estimated value, but probably more accurate.
---
Rum.
---
maybe he wanted to try and quit eve for good, deleting all of his stuff for the "out of sight out of mind" approach 
---
If you only knew who i really am .. bud.
---
I'm considering buying a contract on you and yours for this.  These players could be out mining or ratting in null making far more money than your shitty high-sec sweatshop operation.  
---
Quit the game please. 
---
There is a fleet loot history, just click on the 3 lines above the fleet window.
---
It exports a csv file that you can then import in excel to make aggregates, I am not sure if gsheet can do that as well, but if that is the case, you could even have the minerals prices directly hooked to your sheet and calculate automatically the payouts per fleet members.
---
Just a word of advice though, when someone loots from a can, it will be counted as being looted, so someone mining 50 units, jet caning it, and then someone else picking up these 50 units will show up as 2 x 50 units on the ledger.
---
What ever happened to people reading forums before posting
---
I am just 'bad posting around' but your interest in this topic is intriguing. It is a PH pilot (just run a locator) ... your alt?  
---
It wouldn't really require you trusting anyone. They set a contract for x amount of ore for y value. You check the value before accepting the contract. If it's not right, decline the contract. You might lost a bit of ore through fly time (unless everyone just jetcanned themselves and collected it all themselves at the end) but it saves you a lot of management time trying to keep track of who's ore is what, and having to constantly check prices and make payments for multiple people in the belt.

Nuuuu... don't tell him! 
---
You're perfectly safe in a wolf rayet. And don't worry about that little frig hole, only small ships can fit through there! Surely your mighty dreadnaught can handle pesky little small ships ;)
---
I mean if they're gonna mine in high sec anyway, may as well take my boost while they are doing it.
---

He does Twitch livestreams rarely now.  He was actually on a few days ago.  He is very tied up with a new job at the moment.

Excuse me. I thought this was reddit.

This is a universe of ‘nope!’ For me.

 CCP still turns a blind eye on botting yes
---
Your excavators are being stolen as we speak.
---
\&gt;I don't think it's fair to imply that people with deviant appearances are more likely to have deviant behaviours
---
In nature, purple/yellow/orange/etc exists as warning colours, typically found on poisonous species of snakes, frogs, etc. The knowledge of this is something that's deeply ingrained in our lizard brains.
---
I refuse to not believe that people who dye their hair in these colours aren't on some subconscious level signalling something, either way I am going to trust my instincts.
---
Eve is more of a marathon then a sprint.  
---
well if your not at bombing range or 130 or panic hacs are fine against stuka fleets just look at the engagement properly and fight smart its not unbeatable by a longshot just everyone craps themselves at the sight of it is all. i can see your point though but if you had a fleet do an actuall bombing run it kills HAC fleets aswell 
---
Every time I die I think what should I have done different.
---
Usually the answer is I should have run away when the warning signs were there.
---
Posts like this and one above ensure me that i know you ingame  :D
---
I think you missed out on the opportunity to be honest. You don't know what path they have taken to get to that point, what hardships they have endured. Think of it like taking in a stray dog. If the stray dog snaps at you, it's due to their environment, so taking a stray dog's food away just reinforces the behavior. I say extend your hand, if he snaps, just do it again and offer the food.
---
It goes off Jita cost so it's usually more accurate. I've seen the "Estimated Value" be wildly inaccurate and while sometimes that can work in your favor there are times it can be to your detriment.
---
Well an insured t1 dread costs less than 1b, and apparently you can make that in like an hour. So if you are smart about loot keeping (like a cloaky Strat for scanning/looting or something), you could lose a dread every two or three hours and still make decent money, and then you get to have some fun haw dread fights!
---
Quit bitching about shit that they give you but not in the way you expect. Pretty self explanatory. 
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
100mn NS ratting VNI, does perfectly well in C2s
---
Most people kill the command dessies with groups of cloaky nullified t3c’s that probe the fleet, warp at 0 and smartbomb to kill the dessies
---
How did he die in 0.1 then? ;) 
---
yeah, maybe. not sure if he was aware that his vids actually helped pretty much all new and even experienced players that searched for eve tutorials, me included. 
---
technically boosher are extremely hard to catch, and using booshers for respawn is not the answer. but there are other ways
---
Dont vm's counteract that too? 
---
disable potato mode scrub, problem fixed
---
Smartbombs, tackle frigs, Jackdaws with booshers (for against goku fleets) etc. use your head and think
---
He either didn't jump to a citadel, or jumped to one that he thought he could dock/tether at but couldn't, or got bumped off. Or y'know, RMT.
---
It may, but if you focus your fleet mining boost skills then it will help get great returns. Another thing is if you handle all the sales and put isk directly into your Corp members wallets, guys might not mind as they dont have to do that legwork. 
---
Globby crying about ~~eve~~ reddit mechanics, what else is new
---
This pretty much sums it up.
---
Use an armor HIC and point your drones...
---
Kill them at the gate. 🤣
---
He'll do great in Eve
---
Dont think so bro 
---
Probe them. Neuter the booshers and it’s over
---
Can you elaborate more on what needs fixing about the Boosh meta? (not trolling you) 
---
Interesting, I'll give it a shot then.  Do you turn off sound? Drone models?
---
Don't you mean WTS?
---
What a piece of shit.
---
I made an exception to the r/evejobs thing and let yours through. It addresses more than just general recruitment - but you should make it a point to check out r/evejobs as well.
---
Probably but it's more effort and an IP ban is problematic given the ever changing IP addresses.
---
I was having issues with frequent disconnects with NordVPN, not sure why.  
---
Moros would be better imo - more raw damage against avengers, best tracking among the three. That leaves drifter, which has thermal then em holes on shield and armor respectively, but im pretty sure noros still can one cycle him
---
Revelation really struggles because of its low base tracking, at least in double dread setup ive tested, which relies on hitting stuff with cap guns. Maybe it is not so pronounced in solo.
---
It’s not just impractical, with injectors you simply can’t tell who is a new player and who is a vet. That one day toon may very well be someone’s cyno alt. 
---
Just think : everything in Eve exist only to return to dust :)
---
Not true, more traders = more competition = tighter margins = selling to buy orders isn't super bad compared to sell orders
---
Nag is good middle ground, cheapest of all and flexible. Ofc wolf rayet is probably bad for it
---
For stuka’s off the top of my head just get frigate/destroyer fleet and anchor on the enemy fc. if you manage to get it right you eliminate their advantage.
---
People have mostly answered your questions, but just to add on. There isn’t a lot of space for your specific topic but there’s some things loosely related. For example 3rd party brokers for bigger deals are sometimes needed, but this requires a good reputation in the community. Also diplomacy may put some of your skills to work. Another option is smaller scale brokering (for example someone wants X ship for under a specific price, you find a seller for them). Again these are all very loosely related, but worth at least mentioning. 
---
As far as burning bridges, in general newbie corps (PH, BRAVE, etc) are pretty safe. People have to start somewhere so you probably won’t be excluded if you switch sides. If you want to be a drug dealer, you may want to consider joining a WH Corp (where has clouds are found). Wormhole politics are mostly separate from null politics so if you leave WH space to join a null alliance (or the opposite) you shouldn’t have problems.
---
That is the "What I think I will be doing with my Moros" picture.

Have you ever considered it could be your shitty internet or PC? The server has issue's but i don't know what dimension you are in to be cyring this much.

Anyway, assuming it's not flair bait.... you are in PH you don't deserve to even play the game for that choice.

I thought you were tactical voltage? Changed?

dont say that please it makes me very emotionally sad

Some people aren't interested in charity ISK.  Part of the fun can be working up from zero.  Giving them ISK takes away their incentive to play and sense of accomplishment.
---
YOU DONT NEED GUNS to rat. Last time i was ain a similar position with one of my alts, i rat a little in a vexor with only drones getting salvage for scrap. i eventually get blowed up for lag, and i get the alliance jump freighter to move to me a 45m blueprint of VNI. Many times is better to get a blueprint and do the VNI yourself, and with 500 m is viable if you can use heavy drones and a 100mn propulsor.

Bombing the fleet. Smartbombing the boosher. Sniping boosher or logi or main dps ship. Dreadsniping if you defend with tactical BM.boosh yourself. Let the booshed fleet making mistake :D

To elaborate;
---
1; there are no real reasons to have attorneys, because everything is just fought out. You could try being a diplomat, which sounds like the closest thing that exists now, but you could probably find a way do do it if you are determined enough
---
2: drugs making is just like manufacturing other things, except the blueprints are expensive and rare, the gas is pretty expensive, and not many people mine it in large quantities. The profit margins will probably be low at first, but you could probably make some amount of ISK.
---
3; Nike tennis shoes, jeans, a shirt that says something about some obstacle course I volunteered at, and a Guinness baseball cap.
---
4; Absolutely not, especially if it’s a big null block. It’s sort of expected that someone will join a null newbie alliance when they start out, so if a Corp didn’t let you join because of that, they’re instantly refusing like 80% of the potential members, which doesn’t help a Corp get stronger.
---
And you said you have been on this sub for a while, so you probably already know that eve is a sandbox, and if you aren’t having fun, there’s 1,000 other things you can do. 
---
17 downvotes in 7 minutes damn
---
yea i think ccp staff are vote brigading me
---
You don't need help with a fit as much as you need to join  a corp who caters to new bros. I would Join pandemic horde. Get on discord and mumble. Learn different aspects of the game. Learn how you have fun.
---
Ok. I will do that absolutely 
---
Yeah sounds like a personal problem because my internet never has issues communicating with eve servers. Unless there's a huge battle 
---
&gt;  Because I’ve honestly got bored from exploring, made about 500mil from it now I wanna try something new and more fun
---
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but ratting in a vexor is one of the least interactive things you can do in the game. You drop drones, orbit something, and wait for them to be done killing.
---
What you do have is a crap ton of isk for a 4 day old player. Polish up your frigate skills and go use the isk to pvp, lose some frigates, learn something, and make some friends. 
---
If you havent found a corp yet, go join one. Not only will they help you with fits and other important knowledge, but most of the new player friendly corps just hand out free ships. Your focus shouldnt be on making isk, it should be learning how to play the game and having enough fun to keep playing it. 
---
Yeah cause everyone can play the game but you nigga you need better internet. 
---
There's no courts or process for enforcing the validity of any agreements. Think the board game Diplomacy. If you need an agreement to be upheld and you really care the best way to do it is find someone mutually trusted by both party to hold a sufficient collateral in escrow. But then you're basically trusting one dude. Back in the days I cared about that sort of things (i.e.: 6 years ago) that basically meant /u/ChribbaX.

He has CCP directly on his twitter. That part blew up there long before here. It sucks for CCP because this guy was only with them for a few months and effectively didn't do anything (Community manager for a game that never launched, nor had a community).

Eh bro frat have English speaking corps now, if you want to join them go ahead. There are other autz/China Tz options however. Are you familiar with skill extraction? You can theoretically (depending on market fluctuation) infinitely fund a characters monthly cost after you initially invest time into it's training. The key being setting a limit to the chars training, example 14 mil so rorq pilot reaches its end point of training then you, skill goo it after that. Do some research Itl pay off for you.
---
nope i checked with other people before making this post

it worked for me so i guess its not broken!

This is the real answer. Make them do the work, verify if you actually want to pay the price they offer.

Data/relic analyzers
---
CCP wants us to move and use capital ships. They just buffed them with jump fatigue.  People who want it nerfed are smaller groups who get smashed.  CCP cares less for you because your group represents a exponentially smaller  section on the revenue pie chart. 
---
*cough* ^(POS Party is recruiting) *cough*
---
Easy, as some wrote already ships are consumables, like ammo. 
---
Don't consider loot you found to be yours until you are in jita with it. 
---
About isk lost, take a look at ZKillboard and see how insignificant your loss was. 
---
really depends on where you're aiming to do relic sites. Playing in WH's is a lot different than in k-space. For WH's I'd recommend to check out some youtube videos about solo WH adventuring. These should include the basic WH classes, bookmarking (safe spots and WH's) and knowing about sites. Also checking Zkill for activity in the hole and it's residents can be a good idea.
---
Basic skills that are used are hacking and scanning skills. Anything after that is optional but helps a lot, for example basic fitting skills,training into ships you want to fly (astero or cov ops for example) and cloacking skills. There are different ways to engage exploration. If you want to be able to take down other explorers, astero is a suitable ship for that, but if you want to just run relic sites you can easily do them in T1 exploration frigates or cov ops. The basic difference between them is that cov ops gives best bonuses when trained to max, astero and cov ops can warp cloacked and astero has the best pvp abilities against other explorers. But T1 ships are usually so cheap that a single site can pay up for your ship multiple times compared to more expensive fits for cov ops and asteros. 
---
When it comes to fitting you have to decide what you want to do. Do you want to just do the relics, or maybe do both relics and data? do you want to go cheap and use 2 different analyzers or more expensive for both sites. Note that the more expensive multipurpose analyzers give bonuses from both skills, instead of just relic or data hacking, so in the end they tend to be more stronger than the normal T2 analyzers. They also don't require lvl 5 skills to use them. Do you want to engage another explorer? Then you need to think about dps and tank, but if you're just going to accept the fact that you're going to run away if you see someone else you want to fit for align speed and maybe warp core stabs. There's also modules that increase your scan strength and deviation, so if you have low skills or you're planning on flying cheap without any pvp action, they might be worth checking. There's also implants for scanning and hacking, which might help out, but I've never used them myself and don't know how cost effective they are.
---
There's not that many tips and tricks for it, but the basics are that the sites get harder when you go from high sec to null sec, and WH space has the same sites than null. So if yo have low skills you're going to lose more hacking minigames. This is where the implants and better analyzers come to play. If you don't know about the "rule of 6" check that out in youtube. Also because WH's don't have local it's harder to know if someone is hunting you, so be prepared to warp away or cloak up if someone tries to engage you. The biggest mistake I see players doing is that they approach the can and stay still while hacking. What I'd recommend is that you orbit the can at cloaking radius and cloak up if someone engages and warp away straight after. Also the faster you hack and finish the site the less time you're vulnerable, but also the faster you're finding new sites.
---
Now there's also different sites that produce different loot. So certain space has certain pirate cans to hack, which means some areas of space are more profitable than others. In WH's though it's all mixed and doesn't play a factor. I've spent my whole eve career in WH's so can't really say much about the which areas of space are the most profitable in k-space.
---
Do they know they can join Karma, Horde, Brave, etc. newbie corps and earn 10 x as much?  No.
---
Gout is communicable. 
---
I'm an active player, and I align out and recall drones when I see a neut enter local, I dont warp off until one appears on grid cause most of the time it's a travelcepter just passing through.
---
So, not denying it's probably a bot, but players do that too
---
What do you use a mack for then? It has a large cargo hold so you make less trips from place to place than if you had a small cargo hold
---
If the journeys are short you'd just use a hulk every time
---
These plus the landmarks in the star map really made the game feel 'alive' to me in the beginning. Yes, they didn't really contribute to gameplay... but they contributed to making the universe feel richer, feel inhabited, and that was worth something too.
---

---
Save you some time for the future... None of the wrecks will ever have loot, just the bioadaptive cache and some storage nodes (?) whose name I forget. Welcome back!
---
I think its bad that there is no real counterplay to someone booshing onto you. Its hard to pull off and yes avoidable if your fleet is mobile but like shown here the stuka fleet was in position before half the HACs were properly out of warp. You can defend against someone warping to you with defensive bubble etc. but not against booshing from range. I have no real solution here though.
---
There was talk about nerfing chain booshing but I dont have a final opinion on that. I like active counterplay mechanics more than restricting something by default.
---
In terms of the bombers it feels weird not more died. Appearently the Muninns were in disarray after the first bombs and should have performed better but maybe tweek a few numbers on the bombers so they are easier to kill. Fitting decision in terms of torps and bombs over tank and/or prop mod. just a quick idea. not fleshed out w/o checking numbers. Big maybe on this part.
---
I had alts in Horde but not now.

1. Very unlikely, unless you make it to tye tip execs of a big alliance some day.
---
2. No
---
3. No
---
4. Won't be a problem. Joining a newbro friendly alliance is a must and you can try them all.
---
I like it, I mean, I'm sure it's been suggested before, but it seems reasonable. Obviously number of structures would have to be balanced against activity and presence. Low-power structures should probably not contribute. Perhaps activity levels should decrease fuel costs of structures, so claiming space you can't use just leads to ballooning logistics costs.
---
That said, at a certain point you might as well just remove sov altogether and generate maps just based on alliance player activity. Sort of like how you could generate a low-sec "sov map". I suppose people like their icons on jumpgates though.

Serous 3 days a week for 6-8 months in karate, taekwondo, judo, kicbox, mma or alike school will enable you to parry any bully one on one. 1 year with more intense weeks and you can do one against 3. Not to mention after some time
---
senior students of your dojo will take care of the rest if tehy are numerous. After few years its about maintenance mostly and you will be fine as you will project the aura of do-not-fuck-with. But, no going to the dark side.
---
A bit of bling goes a long way on a kiki, you can then engage a ton of things while still being uber risk averse like a proper elite solo pvp'er.
---
There is no alternative solution to removing local.  Because that is not even on the table.  Plenty of folks are able to kill botters.  You seem to be having an issue doing so.  So yes, get good IS a great contribution, because it is the perfect solution to your problem.

TTU reduces risk of being scanned and potentially set as gank target in hisec, while ANP+Slaves (or bulkheads for non-Ark) increases profitability requirement for making gank on you worth ISK and effort. Both are viable ways of reducing lossmail chance.

use boosted scram fitted ceptors, and fleet warp them at 10. out of range of the smartbombs their fleet will have, and being boosted, will have 12-15km scram range.  
---
grab a few ships and let the fleet boosh away.   
---
keep doing it until they run out of boosh or give up. generally if you grab the hic, they will bail  
---
Smartbomb t3's will only work against frig/destroyer boosh gangs.  the battleship groups, the booshers will have high enough ehp that the t3's will kill them selfs before killing the booshers. 
---
Think most EvE players deal with ship loss with alcohol. When going on ill fated fleets, alcohol is often administered even before ship loss, during ship loss, and after ship loss. 
---
Sufficient intoxication may cause increasingly large ship losses, so its self-perpetuating. 
---
We love you Man!
---
Dude you can't just rapid fire 3 puns like that. Gotta let the barrel cool down between shots.
---
I don't understand what this has to do with mining op payout, I think I'm missing something?
---
1. Losing a ship is a business expense.
---
2. The estimated value is not your friend; your cargo is basically worthless until you sell it.
---
When I owned one I used to transfer the cargo into a regular freighter at the first HS system I landed in.  Otherwise absolutely no chance I'd be spending any more than a few seconds floating in space with a freighter of any kind in low sec or null.  I used to triple-web fit my cyno so he could kiss the JF's bum goodbye on the way out almost instantly.  The Nomads helped too.  Always insta-docked, always jumped when nobody else in local.  Usually jumped 30 seconds before DT, etc. :)
---
A sabre alt or two. 
---
I had an old corpmate that watched super/titan losses, and as soon as one died, anything that dropped they would start actively pursuing those orders. For example, nyx dies with a shadow serpent is 1000Mn, few days later that order fills. Easy few hundred mil profit
---
Was disappointed to not see this post transition into a request for a low sec gate to stain. 
---
I again ask, have you EVER fought a triple injector concord capital booster (or hell even double capital booster) rorqual with leshaks? Do you have ANY experience bashing rorquals with a leshak fleet? I mean seriously. 
---
Finally, please link me a properly fit rorqual that died to a "lesser" scary fleet. Again, properly fit rorqual - double/triple injector, 2 shield booster amp, and a concord capital shield booster - that rorqual fit costs under 3bil. Also, show me your cojones. Link me your KB. Would love to see how many rorquals you bash in small expensive fleets.
---
There's plenty of counterplay.  The first thing to think about is the style and distance of warp-ins.  Booshing fleets aren't infinitely mobile and it's possible to get on grid without being immediately engageable by the stukas with a little bit of forethought.  The second thing to think about is just how poorly that fleet performed once their anchor was webbed and neuted - he even turned his fleet back into the stukas while at ~30km.  HACs can easily shred these bomber fleets or at least force them away if they are positioned carefullly.
---
Nah was a short caribbean cruise

Tch fucking new players, the jump fatigue was a band-aid for a ~~problem~~ symptom that EvE has always had. EvE is too small. You could move across the universe in a capital ship in less than 10 minutes with the old system. (Pan-fam was always a threat of showing up in a fight) In their infinite wisdom to try and fix this problem CCP devs did the following:
---
* Gave us space aids
---
* Doubled the cost of space gas &lt;&lt; You're here, original idea op
---
* Shortened the range of caps
---
Notice how none of that sounds fun. CCP devs should feel bad for the human suffering they have caused. You know what would have made all of this more fun? One thing:
---
* Double. Quadruple. Sextuple. The amount of space there is in EvE. (specifically another 5-10k+ more solar systems)
---
Why would you do this? **Because of EvE's real problem.** There are only ever a few "Orders" (Hint 2 or less (Double hint [https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0584/3841/products/100-polyester-yummy-world-blue-donut-plush-food-pillow-1\_2048x.jpg?v=1505238152](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0584/3841/products/100-polyester-yummy-world-blue-donut-plush-food-pillow-1_2048x.jpg?v=1505238152))) of players. the distance to the enemy is too small. Notice how all the things they try an do are to solve this one problem? That problem, or EvE's problem is: 
---
**Space is distance as measured by time to your enemy.**
---
And frankly **there isn't enough space for a space game.** It takes 30 minutes to cross the galaxy in an inty. Talk about a fucking snooze.
---
*So OP tell us all about your bright ideas, and how original you think you are.* ***How you don't want to wait to move across an entire galaxy*** *in a space game to dunk some nerds. Maybe while your at it tell us how you would fix the blue donut, super capital umbrellas, and hyper inflation.*
---
Maybe the scale of what your doing has worn off now that every yahoo has a capital ship. Dunno.
---
Some napkin math for those that are going to say that EvE is big:  5201 systems in EvE, that's all there is.  25,746 "active" players at any time. That's 4.9 pilots per system at any given moment. I would quadruple the space in game easy, cut space aids in half. If you want to take it easy, only double the amount space.
---
Also remove wormholes, *they reduce space and are a gimmick* ***that hides*** *activity, players, and* ***fun****.* More importantly the ~~autistic children~~ wormholers need to be socialized as a duty to society.

Unlike what has already been stated, I am going to disagree and say there absolutely is a role for a lawyer, per se (see what I did there). If you enjoy litigation and/or mediation you could probably make a decent career as a diplomat. One of the big parts of the job is writing up written agreements like Non-Invasion Pacts (NIPs), ratting rights and dealing with various internal matters, as well as dealing with both allies and enemies behind the scenes. But, if you really want to get your lawyer on, come join Goons and be a lawyer in our world famous Space Court. I don't actually know when the last time we held a "trial" was, but sounds like you could make a pretty decent public defender for any poor slob who can't afford the services of Scooter Mcabe. Obviously the whole thing is pretty tongue-in-cheek. However, I would recommend you try out as many different activities as you can. You never know, you might actually find mining to be enjoyable, or you might find out that you love harvesting tears from suiciding freighters in hisec.
---
Don't get into drug manufacturing. Its pretty much the worst industry. Its controlled by a very small cartel of players who have enough infrastructure invested that they can turn a decent profit, but for a player just starting out, there are dozens of better options. I would start by salvaging ratting wrecks and using the salvage to produce rigs. Once you've gotten good at that, you can move on to manufacturing various items, you can try your hand at mining (yawn), or if you join a group with a good infrastructure (like Goons / Imperium) you can make a pretty penny almost completely passively by refining moongoo. With a couple of alts and a dozen or so blueprints you can easily make a few billion a month with almost zero effort, but it does require a few billion in initial investment.
---
As a new player you really have to try to blacklist yourself from any large alliance. Again, if you're worried about making the transition from a starter group like Pandemic Horde or Brave Newbies to a more "elite" (can you hear me snicker through the internet) alliance like NC. or PL then you would be better off joining Goons. We have corporations like Karmafleet that specialize in recruiting day 1 newbees, and you can stay in that one corporation from your first T1 frigate fleet all the way to multi-boxing titans, or move over to any other corp in the alliance that fits your style with little effort. Karmafleet in particular though runs daily training fleets, has players dedicated to teaching and helping new players and we even have a Gooniversity that will help you learn everything from PVP skills to the best ways to make ISK. Plus all the free frigates and destroyers (and maybe even up to cruisers now) you could ever hope to welp. 
---
Ok, shameless plug over. Whomever you decide to join though, just make sure to undock and pew-pew as soon as physically possible. That's what makes the difference.
---
I guess the reason why i don't see the connection is because there are so many rorquals in delve, this guy could very well have been bringing more drones for the market. I'd assume the market for excavator drones in delve to be a pretty huge one considering how many of them are lost every day in there.

Pretty good aye. But you have to honestly micromanage your drones. Obviously starts to get rather expensive if they keep getting shot at. Pull them, put them back out etc etc. 
---
Still at it. I feel like you should get out, socially. Meet a friend so you dont have to show my posts to total strangers. Then maybe try and get laid
---
The problem is probably your overview. The default is terrible and I'd say a lot of the others are lacking what's needed to survive in WH. Example of what mine looks like: i have a tab that only shows the sun, the cans, and any ship not friendly to me. They blink background colors on my overview so it pulls my eyes and i immediately warp off. There are other things i do but starting with an overview that doesn't suck and is customized for my set up and the layout of my windows has saved me 100% of the time.

Combat is the most fun part but you are making too much money to be in the ships you are in until you have time to skill, with injectors it might be possible but take your time eve is a marathon and you seem like you might burn yourself out in the first month, there is plenty of depth you just need to remember to smell the flowers. Good luck out there , if you are feeling froggy buy 500 m of kestrel fits and burn the house down , it's just space buck right.

Fuck bro, dont quit - that sucks but dont quit. We have all been there - I left the game for ages after losing my life savings, in the form of a Thorax with several different t1 weapon systems, to a gate camp - that was in 2008. I screamed, my hear fell down a hole...I couldn't log in. 
---
10 years later I fly round wormholes bookmarking relic cans and warping my smart bombing Rokh in on top explorers...and thats just on one of my accounts, I have super pilots, sabre alts and all sorts!! the point is, Vets do this shit to new players because it was done to them  - if you can cope with it, if you pick yourself up and get on with it, if your reaction is to fight back - this game deserves you and you deserve it. 
---
This always happens with sexual related crimes that make big stories. I like to think they do it to scare other potential offenders. Also generally with sting operations like this they pretty well have everyone in the bag as far as being guilty regardless - think to catch a predator where they have the initial contact and then the perpetrator actually walks through the door showing intent. Unless you just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are looking for someone with the same name in what is probably a private residence or hotel room, you are likely screwed.

Lol, 6 months?  This is CCP, you're looking at a year minimum for any changes.  2 years if it is substantial changes.

Yeah I know, this money is enough for me anyway I can’t buy anything expensive at this point since my skills aren’t high enough really lol.. I’m trying not to get burned out,  I haven’t had this much fun since I played RuneScape back in 2005. Btw I was thinking of throwing in some money on the game to buy injectors to train up all my basic skills.. I think they call it magic 14 or somethin if I’m not mistaken, to at least lvl 4 or 5, do you think that would be a good idea to get on track and give myself a little boost? Since I feel behind, and I actually regret not starting sooner

I had two of videos of his which were my favorites. The one about hunting for abandoned, lost drones. And the one about finding wrecks in faction warfare &amp; looting them. I still occasionally do those to this day.

Would be great if someone reuploaded all of those videos. They really were a big help to new players.

One thing to keep in mind is that if you join goons a lot of other alliances won't consider accepting you. On the other hand goons will take anyone.
---
Kinda surprised they weren't hyping it up, given how much they've been talking about all the anti sex-trafficking stuff the police have doing in connection with the Super Bowl.
---
oh god you were doing mining ops without a spreadsheet you poor soul
---
Always blame Mira :P
---
Karmafleet is always recruiting! Goonswarm Federation, its umbrella alliance, has Special Interest Groups and Squads that operate in all timezones even AUTZ. While it may be considered as a newbee corp, there's not much difference against other corps. We have full access to what the imperium has to offer and a bit of something else on the side. There are have bittvets and experienced people aplenty. The primary language is English but we cater to diverse nationalities with their own linguistic faculties.
---
It'd make him quit, more likely. 
---
The way my corp use to do mining ops was that when you started mining you signed a ledger with time started, pilot and ship type then when you stopped you signed out. At the end the collector of the ore after it sold would give out isk based on ship type and length of time mining. It meant that the rorqs made more but the subcaps Hulks and such still made a pretty good amount.
---
We don't do it anymore because of mining journal and taxes

Hi CCP Falcon, I'll remind you that  Thomas Cheung has been arrested and not convicted. CCP's abhorrence to  Thomas Cheung has been noted.

Handily executed.
---
Not a new player, but wanted to get opinions.
---
In solo PVP, how does one go about finding targets in a system? 
---
I've seen folks doing the "shotgun" method of just going from anomaly to anomaly trying to find a target, which seems inefficient in my opinion. 
---
The optimal solution seems to be combat probes, but fitting an expanded probe launcher is so CPU intensive that it's very disadvantageous to run it in a build. 
---
One thing I was mulling over was carrying around a mobile depot, deploying it before I start scanning, and then if I find someone, use the mobile depot to unfit the probe launcher, fit / bring online the weaponry and other utilities, and then warp to the target and engage. That seems to work for the most part, but I wanted to see if there was an easier solution.
---
BENJIM
---
I jump into my next ship usually and carry on. Sometimes I need to buy new ships.
---
You get used to it is the simple answer imo.
---
One of the things that changed my mindset was going out on a fun roam several years ago in a cap. We knew it was going to be a clusterfuck and we'd all lose our ships, I agonised over what I was going to take, lots of people were going in caps/blingy stuff and I thought fuck it, I'll be part of the fun.
---
Since then, the mental impact of losing a ship is a non-issue. I still kick myself sometimes if I do something dumb that results in a loss, but ultimately the worst that can happen is you just hop back to a friendly station and grab a new ship.
---
It helps to be sensible too, the old EVE saying of "don't fly what you can't afford to lose" is true. I never undock in a ship unless I can afford to buy it twice over, that way if I lose it, I can decide if I want to go and grab another immediately or fly something cheaper until I have a fatter wallet.

Horde will also take almost anyone. Unless it’s known to directorate you’re a complete ass hat and you’re on the blacklist, you’re fine to join.

It was a very long time ago, back around 1990-1992. He kept leaving work and heading out there, and trying to attack the women there. He did actually have a daughter and was married, but even I've had hard time finding much info on it as this was in the pre-internet days.

Whether or not you believe it or are doing it intentionally. You’re running a hi-sec sweatshop. Especially at 80% payout.

Instead you should get them all to join you in null, and do exactly the same thing for 3x the payout. And maybe they’ll stop mining and see what else the game has to offer 😂

Karmafleet recruitment is basically closed. You have to stay for months in an ingame channel, constantly chatting and being active ingame (they give you really vague info because even they’re not sure what it means. It really makes no sense at all. Their recruitment system got messed up with the api change  and they’re too lazy to update to the new ESI. You’re better if joining another Goons Corp like Ascendance or Cruza. Less stupid atmosphere as well. Saying this as a Goon in none of the corps listed above.

spam 100km snipers with sebos? 1-2 second lock, 100km range, volley the destroyers  
---
You basically have to counter tiny cancer with tiny cancer. You park that corm/other fleet on the stuff you're trying to defend and if they try to get within torp/booshing range, you lock them and fire.  
---
Only thing you have to worry about here is bombing runs. So, you keep the fleet aligned to pings/safes. When they go to bomb, you warp. The bombs miss you. You warp back and continue this BS until they run out of bombs. Then they have to try and just torp you off grid, but torp application is crap to frigs/dessies, and at that point, with your snipers vs. their torps, at close range, you'll basically just trade which is good if you're using corms lol. So bring a lot of the snipers.  
---
I probably shouldn't be posting this because I like it when people think stuka fleets are invincible canceraids, but if CCP thinks booshing doesn't have a counter, they'll nerf it into the ground :(
---
What?

Go to wolf rayet instead, run in confessor or hecate. Clear sites faster, have more fun, and get the odd lolrofltengu that forgets it's a wr and tries to nom you.
---
increasing the total amount of shield / cap does not also increase its recharge time
---
missiles care about speed, turrets care about rate of change of angles, both care about size. similarly, tracking goes both ways, so getting "under their guns" is only a good idea if your guns track better than theirs 
---
only pick 1 tank type and spend your slots on supporting that 1 type. don't mix plates and reppers, just use a rep and resist, or plate and resist. one of those will keep you alive longer
---
most rats are either unaffected by ewar or are not affected in the same ways as you are

Funny story, and I can't explain it. More than ten years back, you could actually see the transaction history of a system in the info window. I can't remember which system it was, but one of the systems in the Western Jove region actually had a handful of transactions listed over the course of 2003-2007. No idea how. Maybe devs doing something outside of their own space.
---
I don't watch this shit game anymore......I retired..

you dont have to be cap stable at all times.

consider what modules you will use at what time and for how long? For example: can you reduce the incoming damage to reduce cap pressure from your local tank...?

Generally mixing tank is retarded unless it isn't.
---
so this really depends where your trying to roam. in ls your gana find fights in plexes and sometime on gates. and every now and then youl catch a miner thats not paying attention. in ns you kinda just warp system to system looking for people doing dumb shit. most of your fights will happen on gates. sometimes youll be able to catch a vni ratter afk in site. 
---
the "shotgun" method you will have a fleet all jump into a system at the same time and everyone warps off quickly to anomalies. this is usually in ns hunting vni ratters. as a sol no thats not something that works. what you need to do is check dscan. if theres a ship you wana fight on d you use the dscan window to angle down and find his location. you have to be pretty quick because most ratters will warp the second someone neutral enters system.
---
combat scanning is also not really a good option. very few ships can use and expanded launcher and still be able to fight. and the whole mobile depot trick wont work because it  takes to much time to drop it scan your target then refit and finally warp. generally when you drop combats you have about 10 or 15 seconds to scan them down and get into warp before there gone.
---
so really the answer is just roam. thats all you can do really. get out there try dumb things and learn from them. o7
---
Here, let me help, the general population of the world wants to see Pedo's suffer, in terrible horrible ways, prison rape is one way, however we'll take public dismemberment and "Saw" levels of torture.
---
You see we dont believe Pedo's deserve a second chance, and living in a small room paid for by the rest of the nation you live in just doesn't seem to fit the bill of what we the population think these trash human beings deserve.  
---
Does that clear it up for you?
---
It depends heavily on what type of targets you want to hit. In general for solo nullsec hunting, your primary tools will be dscan and local. Local to determine if there's anyone in the system at all, a few dscan sweeps to narrow down a guess as to where they might be. You want to get into warp to them as fast as possible, because (thanks ccp) standard operating procedure for most ratters and miners is to start docking up when they see you enter local. That means you have maybe 6 seconds plus their reaction time to scan down a guess, warp, land, burn, lock, and tackle. And that's measured from when you enter system, before you even load grid.

Dude, leave some puns for other people.
---
Shotgunning is for when you have several people, and usually you’ll start dscanning after you land if everyone misses.

What you’ll do solo is fly to a celestial in the middle of a bunch of anomalies, and start using dscan to narrow down where someone is

If the servers can’t run the current number of systems how the hell are they supposed to run triple that number. To calculate every anomaly, wh, astral body. The servers couldn’t take that. Also more systems would prevent player interaction. If the number of systems were tripled, people could just sit in their own systems and never interact with others. It’s Everyone v Everyone.

This thread is cooling down but I have to tell my story, it fits too well.
---
So, around 2007 I was returning to Eve and I was looking for a corp. It was before I realized I was a pvp dude, and I was mostly looking at indy corps.
---
I was fairly young (around 17) and didn't really understand the game that well (non native speaker) so I wasn't really into production or logistics, I wanted to mine and haul, as that's what I knew and enjoyed best.
---
So I printed out a handful of corps adds looking for "minors enjoying to play in group". I forgot the printed adds in the printer and I had a livid mom coming to see me a couple of hours later asking about those adds for minors wanting to play. We had a good laugh and that was it, but this might be the only thread in this decade where I feel this is relevant.
---
This doesn’t surprise me. CCP has a gross corporate culture. Go have a look at the dust 514 discord (it’s not official except for all the resident ccp employees...) they have a sub board just for soft core underage porn.

I was in the same position as you.
---
I made about 1b off the market in 2 weeks and then lost almost 800m hauling. I felt like quitting, did for a few days, then ended up coming back to the game. I've been playing for a few months now and have so much more.

---
"haha just bring more ships" is not an argument for the function/principle of the issue. Running with 3 people and fighting 10 or 20 isn't an issue...as long as a super can't show up and tackle you from 100 KM away. That's the problem there. You don't have a solution for that. A super that is immune to any kind of counter play in that situation shouldn't just be able to tackle your gang like that. Maybe if you did more than just krabbing you'd know that.

Step 1 isn't choosing a ship, it's choosing a purpose you want your ship and fit to serve. Step 2 is choosing a ship that will allow you to do that. Step 3 is deciding on a fitting aimed at that one purpose.

---
The only tank mixing that's acceptable is using hull buffer on small armor repping ships. I can't think of another case where it's not a terrible idea.
---
By complaining on reddit!

Serious answer: Ask 2017 NCdot, they gained some experience.

imagine that he did get away with it, and that was your kid. This isn't a standard crime..... pedophilia and child molestation has a pretty large chance of fucking up that's kids life. That chump will now just sit behind bars.... personally deserves it. You can't rehabilitate someone who has fantasies over kids... it's ingrained into the mind. 
---
Well I’m with u that you shouldn’t have to pay for something you don’t use, but if you train you use it , so u have to pay for it in my opinion and I’m playing this game for more then 10 years 
---
aren't dual tank rags ok
---
No i'm pretty sure they do. You just spend your life in the comfort of your dark bedroom with your PC monitor as the only source of light you have for days at a time. Child rape and molestation is not a bog standard crime and it's consequences are so much more catastrophic. 
---
Racial bonuses/tanks/resists. 
---
I am in CST, I joined Brave Newbies and have been having a blast. Check it out in game.
---
nothing, i'm right in the center of my mind. You are just a soft normie who spends their life tucked up in their bedroom. At which part did i encourage rape as a punishment?. I don't care what happens to him on the inside but anything described in the video is good enough imo.
---
No but he had full intentions of harming a kid. Molesting some helpless kid who would have had their life destroyed as a result of his intent. You are literally a chump. Imagine that was your kid.... just because he didn't do anything, he clearly had intention since he got caught in the sting moron.
---
all these soft sheltered people on this thread is mind blowing.
---
Jesus christ! ccp recoiled back to incarna after reading that.
---
I saw his stream 2-3 days ago.
---
Gila exploration run.  
---
&gt;We too, people also are aware that his actions have no relations to CCP or EVE.
---
&gt;We know that CCP didn't knew about it. 
---
Why would anyone make this assumption?
---
If you’re sincere about crying then please just quit Eve. No joke here. It’s not for everyone. 
---
You can use a hic very easily, I've caught people trying to spearfish my logi.  It's fun watching them Wtf in local. 
---
I can't look it up right now but there is a system description which says "Get the pod! Get the pod!". 
---
Spoke to JonnyPew in an exploration channel, in-game, a few times. Basically, he deleted his videos because they were out of date, but also because he didn't want to deal with the negativity that he was getting from folks in the comments. He seems like a very conservative dude who doesn't like to deal with any excess stress or negativity. 
---
That's another reason why he doesn't join a Corp, anymore. He doesn't even like swearing or dirty jokes.
---
Oh wow, I did not know this, is there a list of all the systems that have lore?
---
He's a regular in Club Deadspace.
---
Nothing, I've learned that a creative approach can be the best approach. There are too many "rules" to fitting that I think is really holding people back.
---
Your comment is all over the place. You're pretty sure the whole world fantasizes about rape and torture, apparently the reason I don't is because of my dark room with a computer, and also child molestation is really bad.
---
What point are you trying to make? Do you think I don't believe child molestation is a huge fucking problem because I would love to know your insight there. I just don't think the solution to rape, molestation, and torture, is more rape, molestation, and torture for the public to cheer and celebrate. It breeds more evil. It breeds more people that think, "this is ok to do to people that deserve it". But who decides who "deserves" to be raped and h7miliated? A judge? Reddit vigilantes? A pedophile who sees a kid "asking for it"?
---
Look up the ship bonuses. My first toon used a Venture for work hole exploration, while my Probe collected dust.
---
Weapon/turret mechanics (tracking/sig) in conjunction with ammo type and capacitor usage.....all of those are important at the moment of choosing loadouts....but grappling the facts all together to come up with what you want is quite hard to understand at the beginning
---
1. Don't let them get close
---
2. Scram them if they get close
---
3. Panic and get booooooshed
---
The breacher is pretty widely used with ancil shield booster and armor repper
---
I know that this might be a tricky concept, but paying money to developers is generally considered good for the long term health of any game.
---
You can mix active and buffer tank when you need additional buffer between cycles of reps, generally because armor reps are much slower than shield reps.
---
&gt; You're pretty sure the whole world fantasizes about rape and torture
---
what are you talking about you absolute clown? I didn't say the whole world wants to see pedos being raped and tortured. What i'm saying is that a lot of people would love to see a pedo get a worse punishment than simply being behind bars. That implies a number of things. 
---
But what's well known is that the prison population not the "whole world" as you spout has had a long term hatred towards: Rapists, Child molesters &amp; woman beaters.... that's been the consensus withing the prison system for a long time. It ain't going to change. But that's cool, if you sympathize with this child molester it's all good.
---
Most people try to think of a hard counter that doesn't lose many ships or is outright a paper-rock-scissor type deal. That isn't going to be the case with a combined arms doctrine. Rokhs and Ravens don't hit small things well. A small group of sacrificial hard tackle dps assault frigates can get into the thick of those fleets and scram/dps the command destroyers. They won't out right kill them if they are in small numbers, but if you commit 20-30 AFs you will destroy the 10-20 CMDs in that boosh fleet and you will effectively immobilize that fleet which then allows your remaining fleet units to come in and brawl. The problem here is most people don't like to plan for losses ahead of time so they don't see it as a successful counter. The other thing you can do is a cormorant fleet and volley from 100km. Both strategies require your FC to be able to keep pace with the booshing fleet and not be outpaced/outmaneuvered. The corm fleet specifically has to make sure there isn't a small detachment of bombers or maybe even 1 around waiting to snag them.
---
By the way, I was very impressed by the video too, great job.
---
active + buffer is quite acceptable on a lot of active smallgang fits that need to be able to withstand alpha but still want to be active to stay on grid
---
see: lse's on active logi t3's or 800plate+maar HAC fits
---
So I literally just did this last night on the test server since i want to do the same thing.  The capital size guns are a must against the avengers that spawn when bringing a cap.  Even with subcap guns you can not track the frigates.  But they appear to orbit in smartbomb range.  Didnt have a web to test if that allows me to track them.  If not killed fast enough the avengers will neut you enough to break your tank with a cap stable build with one enduring repper.  
---
Im currently trying to acquire loads of hisec moons and build a newbro empire, it's fuckin HORRIBLE isk but it's pretty fun tho.
---
Being completely serious for a moment: You ought to consult with a workplace therapist to see if it would be worth bringing one in for a week or so. Stuff like this can hurt people mentally if it's left alone. 
---
My first mistake was listening to all the dumbos on reddit or in my corp instead of looking up best practices on my own. 
---
I have no love for Falcon but you're being a right cunt. Sod off. 
---
it's a series of steps for me:
---
1. rage
---
2. crying in the fetal position
---
3. promise i'm going to unsub all my accounts
---
4. buy plex to refill my wallet  
---
undock, rinse, repeat, until eve dyes 
---
I killed a lot of people who helped me test my tank in amarr back in the day.
---
I wish there were some very clear distinctions.
---
1st off, lets concentrate on the most common PvE content goal that most new players that come into the game set eitehr as their main or side goal, L4 missions.
---
So the 1st thing I was told that you need a battleship and good skills with it to do L4s. Now mind you this was many years ago, we have a ton more options now some of which were not available back then, but even then, this was an extremely downright false statement as most L4 missions can be done much faster and better in either faction cruisers, T3Cs, or even some T2 cruisers. The only time battleships exceed cruiser performance is on the huge missions when players choose to do a full clear instead of just going for mission completion. Even today I see a lot of new players post threads such as : which ship is best for L4s and get a bunch of fucked up answers from dumbfucks or trolls. Then these players lose super valuable training time and on top of that end up with ships that can do far fewer types of content and are far less flexible, then it would had they set the correct path.
---
2nd is PvP and PvE fit distinctions. For example, when you set your training goal for Aries or Retribution or Manticore for PvP, its entirely different then going for a ratting VNI or Gila or a Mining Procurer or Indy transport ship.
---
I see a lot of players wanting to do both, on same ship type, only to find out that their ship will not work in one or the otehr even if they refit due to the shit advice they have been given. When experienced vets give ship advice, they need to keep in mind other goals that the person they give advice to might have, or specifically state the specific purpose of the ship / fit.
---
Other things I wish I had known when I was new: 
---
The gigantic importance of picking weapon system(s) that do not use capacitor. I can't even stress how gigantic and huge this is. GFL trying to do combat in a laser or hybrid active armor tank with level 2-3 cap skills. Shit I even remember times when my cap would run dry in middle of some long jumps and it would literally knock me out of warp due to low cap / warp / navigation skills. And the number of times that I needed to warp off but couldn't cause of the fucking active armor tank + cap using weapons, was just staggering, especially in PvP. I didn't even need to be pointed, just couldn't warp off.
---
So choosing more passive or cap efficient tank and weapons that do not use cap is of utmost importance. Not just for their own functionality but increased fitting freedom because if you don't need to stack cap volume and cap regen modules and rigs then you have space for other stuff. 
---
I think its very possible. its a matter of how much time you wanna spend.
---
Do you think local spybots are omega? Why in the hell would someone pay subs to just do intel? 
---
Is a target painter better than a missile guidance with a precision script ? I will be dualboxing the sites.
---
Good try bot man they are getting pretty advanced that they post of reddit now
---
&gt;unironically calling somebody a normie
---
uh huh, good job laddie
---
Industry and hauling? No clue.
---
1b in 30 days doing alpha exploration? very easily
---
TR for short.
---
we've got COPD, it'll never go away but it's gonna take a while to kill us.
---
In my original comment I said
---
&gt; No. Your twisted fucked up fantasies are not how "the general population of the world" thinks
---
And
---
&gt; You think the general population wants to see someone prison raped or publicly dismembered
---
To which you replied
---
&gt; No i'm pretty sure they do
---
So that's what I'm talking about, doesn't seem too confusing. You never said anything (in response to my comments anyways) about people simply "wanting worse punishments".
---
Did you even read the first comment I replied to?
---
&gt; the general population of the world wants to see Pedo's suffer
---
I don't know how you managed to interpret "the general population of the world" to mean "the prison system".
---
"You don't want to see someone raped and dismembered for their crimes, you must be sympathizing with them" ok dude.
---
They aren't pulling that much in with current prices.
---
definitely a lot of alts considering once u get an alt trained into whatever u want it to do they're basically free now if u just farm their sp.
---
Wow what an intense goal to make 4m a hour for eight hours a day wow how could this ever be done omg so hard right now 
---
Well someone cared to post this here and start the post from Ex-CCP
---
If that has worked out for you it's great!  
---
All I want to do is to showcase how the internal mechanics of the game work on their most basic level. For some people (like myself) that's a very interesting thing to wrap your mind around!
---
EC-P8R
---
quite possible, been a long while since I've checked the numbers.
---
ITT: people not reading the post
---
First time I did PI I bought a CovOps cloak (which was litelary all my money at thqt time) for my T1 industrial and I sat there wondering why I couldn't fit it...
---
Train up fitting skills first. I put together a number of Incursus frigates to throw away in lowsec pvp when i was still new. I found i still had one a few years later and its fit hurts my soul looking at today because of how much extra fitting space it has but i had fit it with an pg rig and a cpu in the low. 
---
EOH Poker was my favorite pass time as well. I never won big on somerblink or eve-bet but EOH required some actual skill and was the first place I won 5bil. That isk lasted me years too haha.
---
It’s some lame attempt at humor. 
---
I run a "few" rorquals and the last 2-3 weeks they are averaging 100-120m an hour on +10 % variety.  If you are actively clearing the belt from beginning to end, 100m. If you are dropping onto gneiss and spod and out in an hour, 120m per.
---
Thanks! That was it.
---
same, his vids were unbelievably helpful AND enjoyable, hope he makes a comeback :D 
---
If you like that, try running 3 torps, 3 rhmls on a Raven. The big bad taboos are holding us back
---
If you want to use a vexor, go for Vexor Navy Issue instead. It is a much better ship. 
---
Training wise, train light drones only up to level 3, then medium and heavy up to 5. Specialize in Gallente / Caldari for PvE, Gallente / Min for PvP. train up drone support skills, tracking optimal, flight speed etc. 
---
naturally, you'll need some armor, tank, cap etc. As stated in other posts, you do not need guns on it. Concentrate on 1 tank type and 1 weapon type at a time, if you spread too much it will become ineffective. 
---
Do not go for the shield fit VNI, its a botting fit not suited for too much stuff. 
---
SHINTAHT IS THE ONLY NAMED SYSTEM IN PROVIDENCE REEE
---
Agreed, I think time is a huge factor at the moment. One of the biggest drawbacks that I see at the moment is not having the ability to modify trades outside the station on alpha accounts. So there will have to be a lot of back tracking to manage the market sell orders.
---
&gt;8 hours a day
---
Oh definitely exploration and huffing are probably the easiest way, but what fun is that :)
---
what about the mighty dualrep + plate Kronos tho? 4head
---
I heard asteroids have a new animation
---
Yeah we never thought that a little silly wording about benefits information would be of any consequence, but since yesterday, the site copy has been changed for obvious reasons. \~Ex-CCP Manifest
---
Here's a good one: mixing the same weapon class and type is okay and good to squeeze every ounce of DPS out of your fitting. Ex: 4 heavy ion blaster iis and 2 heavy neutron blaster iis. But don't mid heavy blasters with railguns
---
Same, I've been subbed to it for 4 years+ now and it's been stable when I've tried to connect. 
---
Just bare in mind OP that CCP might flag your account and lock you out if they see your IP changing. There have been a few posts of folks saying they were locked out and I've had a corp mate who's a Truck driver get one of his accounts temp banned due to frequent IP changes when he goes from state to state. 
---
I do hope everyone at CCP Games remembers that accusation is not the same thing as guilt, no matter how serious the accusation.
---
We will see. On an alpha account you have limited cargo space, limited industry lines, which means you have to plan and make the most out of every place you decide to go. Starting from scratch with no ISK and no outside help, I think this is a worthy challenge. :)
---
Stop playing the game to PLEX. This is why there is little fun left. Everyone plays to PLEX their account. Very few play the GAME.
---
It really should end. 
---
Well neither are industry and hauling to me, but to each their own :P
---
Fuck Journalism, what is the link with CCP? 
---
I seem to remember it was easier to take, because you knew it was all so brutal and accepted it as such. 
---
Blood Raider Amarr style robes you earn from awoxing your own militia. That will increase content.
---
Hahaha holy shit your reasoning and logic sounds like the witch scene from Monty Python Holy Grail

Good thing those dreads and supers were there. otherwise that JF would have infinitely tanked all damage.. WHEW!!!

Nulli Extra was my favourite.
---
" Everyone plays to PLEX their account. Very few play the GAME." bro speak for yourself not the whole community. if i had to make a guess i would say most people just pay the sub.
---
it makes it harder to code simple OCR-based bots
---
An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.
---
I don't think he is lying, or incorrect.
---
Which is why anyone with a modicum of civic virtue within them should remember when such accusations are made that the standards of innocent until proven guilty is a necessary underpinning of rule of law.  Bypassing the hurdles of due process and standards for what constitutes humane punishment can be done easily by prisoners, but shouldn't be, and shouldn't be encouraged.
---
Don't fly what you can't afford to replace, imo. 
---
I think a lot of players make huge investments into ships they're barely skilled enough to undock, nevermind fit, and when they lose them they think the game's over because they don't have enough capital to rebuy and refit the same exact ship. 
---
Stuff your pride in the trash, fly Frigates until you can instantly and easily replace and refit them optimally.
---
Move onto Destroyers, and then Cruisers, and so on and so forth until you either push into Capitals or t2 subcaps. Or maybe you stay in t1 or Faction subcap Pvp because you find it more fun. 
---
Lol be nice
---
Just like the majority of CCP employees. 
---
Very few have their names associated with what they work on, in public. 
---
"Just make a few friends and fit a cyno - then none of your other fitting skills will matter."
---
A VPN will only make your connection worse, not better. You are simply putting an additional server between you and the game.
---
They trust you when they dump their ore and you're supposed to pay them out accurately and timely right? 
---
It's a two way street. 
---
Among the best people who make eve videos, maybe only second to RooksandKings?
---
&gt; I like to think they do it to scare other potential offenders.
---
Making my current money tutoring, I simply refuse to even help underage girls because of this mentality. One vindictive girl is simply not worth whatever I could be paid for tutoring them when my entire life could be ruined from a false accusation. 
---
A minor can be a 17-year-old, which is pretty common for people I am tutoring. 
---
I do agree, there are a lot of people that play just to PLEX. I pay for two Omega accounts and do PLEX for time to time. Hell I have a friend that takes a week and focuses on exploration to do it then goes back to normal playing.
---
Its a fun challenge but you are right PLEXing should not be the main focus of playing EVE. 
---
To say the average person has thoughts about pedophiles and rapists suffering is likely true. However, saying that the general population wants to see anyone get prison raped, publicly dismembered, "saw style" things etc just leads me to believe this guy may be projecting. 
---
Innocence until proven guilty is a really hard mind state to maintain, especially in vile cases like these. I admit to failing this in multiple instances. However, that is irrelevant to the form of punishment that is deemed acceptable.
---
CCP\_Falocon 
---
\&gt;  We consider this behavior to be completely abhorrent  
---
Look, I get it's really easy to judge someone immediately based on what the media says but we live in a society that is **Innocent until proven guilty.**  
---
We do not know the exact details of his case.  If sufficient evidence proves his guilt then he deserves what he gets, but please realize that many of these cases are thrown out due to entrapment.
---
I have a friend who got caught up in the same situation in my hometown in Colorado and many people who didn't even know him immediately bashed him.  He was later completely relieved of all charges due to insufficient amount of evidence to prove ill intent.
---
you're going to have to build rigs, which means doing exploration
---
as an alpha your ability to mine is very curtailed, so making hulls and other ore-based goods will be extremely unproductive
---
What mentality? It was a sting operation. They lured people in by acting like underage girls, it wasn't some one off  random accusation by an actual underage girl.
---
His hair looks like he is a teenager so not surprising he is trying to get into them. 
---
Wow the amount of pedo apologist on reddit is alarming, but also makes sense. 
---
Your marriage/relationship will suffer if you don't set boundaries.
---
Oh I pvp plenty. I'm aware of tactics I used to DC regularly.
---
See your issue there is running 3 people fighting 10 or 20 dont take those fights or go into places that you know that will happen.
---
As for a super being immune in a play with 3 people. That's insanely wrong it's just again what you bring with you to the fight. A super can tackle you from 5,000km away much more 100. Your solution there is dont engage a supercarrier or bring more than 3 people. You seem upset that 3 people cant defang a super and 3 cant typically, even a normal carrier would shred through you without the ability to tackle you.
---
The problem here is you wanting to engage that type of hull or going where they will agression you in that type of hull. Fighters have flight time, are often incredibly expensive. And a super carrier using fighters to sling missiles or torpedoes is something that is obvious for a fighter and is placed on drones. Which are smaller and less advanced so theres no reason they cannot be. Look at those tackle fighters as frigates and the lights as cruisers. They much in the way of supers are or should be looked at as hostile ships. 
---
If your only issue here is that a super can tackle than are going about defanging or bringing down the fighters wrong. More over if you are in a situation that cant prepare. 
---
Stop being so presumptuous that I'd only crab, I enjoy pvp and I go into it prepared to win or lose and dont put myself in situations where I'd want or even expect to survive that. That's adapting which you clearly have not done. Go back to the wh and crab there or pvp in your hole. That seems the content you want or prefer anyways where three people could take down caps. But that also entails controlling your situation which you seem to be bad at.
---
What sort of skill level do you need? I thought making T1 stuff didn't make much for the time spent.
---
Inb4 you get crucified for saying "guild" instead of corp. 
---
Also, check out r/evejobs for corp recruiting. 
---
[Fit a cyno!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_x1fYm-VBk)  Seriously, cap pilots love dropping their big shiny toys.
---
First mistake saying guild.
---
eve is a full time job bud what are you a casual?
---
Or put more simply - if you expect a group that is in no way prepared to fight a super, to be able to hinder it, than that's issue number 1.
---
Fuck you stupid pedo apologist. I hope you don’t have kids because your attitude on this topic will put them in danger. 
---
If you have spare couple of pennies, and can get a EC2 micro, Digital Ocean, or Azure servers. You could roll your own with Algo its really great I use it all the time to play EVE and do work through [https://github.com/trailofbits/algo](https://github.com/trailofbits/algo)
---
My theory is that this was an early in-production test environment cut off from the rest of the universe. 
---
Check out (RTF) Remember the Fallen. The are an awesome bunch of guys that focus primarily on PVP. 
---
Whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty?
---
ayy chemofleet. those are the best
---
Everything being built will be bought at market and hauled back to another station for industry, then hauled back to market. In the interim hauling commodities and possibly contracts would be the filler. So every jump needs to profit some sort of ISK. This is the plan SO far :) Logistics nightmare lol
---
lot of mids, lot of lows.
---
I live in a country where we try to help the mentally ill. I'm sorry that you don't live in such a country.
---
My road to my first billion ISK was much shorter and just required a few ops in a WH corp
---
Someone didn't bother to actually read the post
---
Yeah, but that would have made more sense to do somewhere in UUA-F4 like the ISD constellation, or Polaris. This system was almost as far away from those as could be in Jove space. Also, the Jove used to have mission agents in the stations in Jove space. It's a shame the Jovian ship assets were removed from the game, as well as the actual Jovian racial models they had pre-Incursion.
---
Video is really top notch!
---
https://zkillboard.com/character/92293975/
---
lol. How can you post such things with this kb?
---
"The solution is don't engage." Here let me explain to you how this works since you've never done anything of this sort.
---
Wormhole crew opens up an exit to nullsec blob coalition space. Pops out 3 cruisers, a ceptor and a destroyer. Now it's a race against time to shoot something before the response fleet shows up. Manage to snag a couple VNIs. Response fleet shows up of 15-30. Using better more expensive fitting we can kite and pick off certain people from their fleet. They're F1 krabs, we usually tend to fly our own ships without an FC anchor.
---
Once the super shows up there's not much you can do. As you said it will point you out to 5,000km. So the option? Jump back in your wh, re-roll. Here's the problem. The content just goes away there. The situation goes from cat and mouse game to nuclear warhead and mouse. There's no "skill" involved in putting a siren on a cruiser to tackle it.
---
So does giving a super the capability to completely shut down this content good or bad for the game? Less content happens so I would say bad.
---
But again because you're a krab who's pvp experience is limited to hitting anchor and F1 and your play style is based on making sure you have a little safe spot to mine and krab, you're going to see it your way.
---
Been watching too much Big Lez after the recent release? XD
---
so that approach works well when you already have a decent grasp of the game mechanics.  There are rules that newbies need to follow if they want to have enough success to get to a point where they can get creative with fits.  
---
Shit I remember the first time I played EVE, my fits were garbage and I didn't find that out until I got in a corp and was told how to actually work through the mechanics.  I would fit rails and blasters range weapons, and mix hybrids and missiles to my corm all of different meta levels. I did this because: 1) I needed both long range and short range attacks. 2) why would a ship have slots for turrets and missiles if you weren't supposed to mix and match? 3) Why wouldn't I fit whatever I looted from the missions?  I didn't know what Jita was or that it would be better to just spend the isk to get the same meta weapons.
---
20 rail cormorants, warp at 70, align out, lock boosher, F1, warp out, repeat.
---
If rail corms aren't cool, use sniper t3d of your preference.
---
If you give me a way in I can give you pointers
---
That will teach Hi-Rez for not supporting Tribes. 
---
Yeah dude let me just jump my 80 man dread gang out of the wh. You're so right. hahaha why didn't I just think of that? Thanks for your "bring more dudes" idea. Brilliant over 9,000 IQ reply there.
---
Is there a boosh nerf coming? Or did I get baited.
---
My guys get free boosts. And sell the compressed ore are jita mineral price in station
---
I make about 1b in profit every 4 days or 5 days. I spend about 1 hour a day doing it, which works out to be something like 55 minutes in the evening adjusting all my orders and then 5 minutes in the morning just listing all the stuff that buy orders filled overnight, and then putting up new buys for anything that sold.
---
At any given time I probably have 20b in sell orders up, and about the same in buy orders, but with the skills trained up, it means I have 5ish b in the buy orders, which means in theory I'd need an extra 15b in my wallet if every single order filled in a day. That's never going to happen though.

Yes I do fleet in null and like fleet engagements, yes I do typically take fleet fights that do run f1 doc style. That's my preference and where it matters in nullsec.

They dont shut down all content they shut down yours and your content means wanting 3 unprepared unequipped pilots to wreck or defang a super or squad of them. Regardless of their ability to tackle via fighters they can still pop bubbles and hold you down that way or go with mid slots. Stock areas better out if whs or engage within your limits and stop complaining like a 9 year old who is told they can only have one scoop of icecream instead of the icecream shop. Jeezus.

You're hitting the nail on the head, you're ability to get creative is due to your deep understanding of the mechanics of the game.  Rules in fitting (i.e. don't dual tank/mix tanks, fit to your hull's bonuses) are there to make it possible for players to achieve what you've achieved.

lol "only one account." It's your main you scrub krab. Your opinion means literally shit. Once again learn to read. Nobody said I think a 3 man gang should defang a super. I said sirens shouldn't be able to tackle subcaps. If a super wants to fit a long point, that's fine. Or bring a faction fit Arazu. But that has play and counter play.

The rule of thumb is that shield resistances lean towards the explosive side, and armor resists lean towards EM. All T1 hulls of each separate race will have the same racial resist profile. T2 hulls depend on the manufacturer, for example the Brutor Tribe ships (Minmatar) all have a crazy 90% armor EM resistance.

Things that have worked historically:
---
- massed interceptor wings spreading scrams over the destroyers
---
- machariels relentlessly warping in and exhausting the fleet's capacity to boosh
---
- fighter swarms on any grid where the objective is smaller than a fortizar
---
- suicide stabbers (see point #1)
---
- well executed chemo attack (smartbombing nullified T3s)
---
Things that should work on paper:
---
- slippery petes warping to the ravens individually and keeping pressure on the destroyers
---
- multiple fleets of almost any composition pursuing them constantly
---
- another boosh fleet (Nagas, Rokhs)
---
Things that have historically not worked
---
- massed titan or dread wings (insufficient range
---
- massed carrier swarms (can't catch up to the Ravens)
---
- hopes and prayers (Bob is a cruel god)
---
Ravens have several glaring weaknesses that can be exploited:
---
- the battleships have next to no tank
---
- anemic capacity for remote reps
---
- inability to maneuver by any means other than MJDs and warp
---
- killing the command destroyers kills the entire fleet
---
- no tackle
---
- terrible application (cruise missiles)
---
- need a lot of room to maneuver, which is why they are almost exclusively used to bash keepstars and fortizars, whose models are large enough to let the ravens dance over a large area, instead of being confined to a small grid

Kick 0WNED.
---
&gt; Also more systems would prevent player interaction.
---
Prevent is a strong word, reduce is a better one. That's the idea, more distance between the ~~players~~ Alliances allows more space to spread out. More smaller Alliances to break away, and find their corner of the  universe.
---
&gt; people could just sit in their own systems and never interact with others. 
---
Perhaps, but I think not. You would still have wars, you would still have sov, but controlling triple the space the **MEGA Coalitions** own now? A lot harder for sure. Easier for smaller guys to nibble, and grow, and spread. It would actually generate more high level conflict, as Sov warfare is a formality right now, something that typically happens AFTER you've beaten the other mega alliance's structures and will to a pulp, or blue balled them to death.
---
Secondly, you can't sit around in null and not interact. People come, as they do and ring your doorbell all the time. *You can afford to not interact at an individual level if your say a renter, or an average line member* because your protected by the group. But a lot of these groups are loose collections of dudes who gang up with each other because they need to in null **because numbers matter.**
---
And the only reason numbers matter is because your enemy is too close, because there is too little space **(remember as measured by the time it takes them to get there)**, because there are so few systems.
---
Not to be a downer here but this may be the best we get with Pearl Abyss at the reins.

Rev is ok. Nag is better. 
---
The nag tanks better, has more flexibility when refitting for max tank (shield boost amps &amp; invulns) vs. max spank (lots of mids for tracking, webbing, and painting). Nag guns track better, nag has better ammo, and shields are more forgiving of mistakes than armor (reps land first). Nag is vertical. Rev is a space pigeon. 
---
Rev can work fine. Nag is better. Anything but a phoenix.

Although historically, attempts to chemo the actual author of chemo have ended... poorly

---
While it's true that bright colours are used to attract mating partners, especially among birds, we're talking about two completely different classes of animals here. What's funny about your world is that you think that because you can find an outlier to a trend, often completely outside of context or relevance, that this alone invalidates the merit of that suggested trend entirely. This psuedointellectual rhetoric is a major part of what makes reddit an insufferable shitpit of dumb people pretending to be smart; everything is always relative, tolerance is the only virtue. Anything remotely against these tenets gets brigaded down or moderated.

You can be serious and act like an adult. Just saying. And no my pvp experience is not extremely limited aside from solo where I have almost none. I love small gang and blops. But I love large fleet as it is where I feel makes the game feel like a true empire builder that it is and wants to be. Also I am not so paper thin to cry over this game or that specific toons killboard. Who does not directly benefit from...fighters that can scram. 
---
And no a 3 man fleet should not be able to defang a super, but that's what would get passed their fighters. Aside from that theres not much you can do. A super or rather the fighters scramming working as intended.
---
Again you presume to much. You should work on that. Maybe have more I  depth knowledge on people before assuming stuff about them or how they carry themself. That might explain your childish demeanor. 
---
Look at the bonuses, that's how you fit it. No exceptions.
---
Almost everything you just said is incorrect with the exception of needing to kill the avengers.
---
1) The way you run C5 sites in a dread is by blapping the regular sleeper BS with capital guns. When they spawn they burn away with 0 transversal and you can easily 2 shot them with cap guns. You kill the avengers, then kill the drifter. 
---
2) You can easily track and kill the frigates with HAWs. 1 painter 1 web 1 grappler 1 tracking comp (this is why nag is better; with rev you have a cap battery in the mids you cannot take off) you will kill them easily. Most sites you can just SB them off, but it takes ages and gives you a combat timer (less than ideal since you need to regularly refit to kill triggers).

Mhmm. There are drones that could web and scram that they could have used for years before these versions of fighters as they could use any form of drone including sentries. And I think its ec-300s I cant recall that can scram cant recall of the top of my head. But they could use them to scram ships. No real difference between then and now eith that function really.

I mean the drones exist that scram...and supers could use them. And no I'm not lying im saying that a 3 man group could not defang them it's what I have been saying the entire time. That your group would not have been prepped to fight that to begin with. Also hunting exists. Chasing targets exists. As does extracting safely or actually killing the target(s) I ran an alliance once and it was viewed as my job and we did well. I currently am no empire builder but part of an empire.

Well, the times people randomly bomb our own fleet don't make the video clips but yeah, generally we perform well when we need to and INIT have quite a few very impressive FC's.  
---
Hard to whore efficiently with...I managed to tag a lot of Muninn's as they popped.  
---
37km range is a bummer though for sure.
---
Yes, no assistance, alpha alts or omega alts. 
---
Expected a post about the Chameleon. That alliance tournament ship who compensated for it's horrible tank with ECM, is now a glass canon with a huge buff to it's taunt modules.
---
But yeah the Chimera could use a slight buff. ECM immunity for it's fighters sounds really nice. Although it opens the door to web immunity for a Nid's fighters, scram immunity for a Thanny's fighters, and I have no idea what the Archon should get as well. 100% reflected Cap warfare if you make the mistake of trying to neut a cap-less ship? Dunno.
---
Can you not boosh in a hic bubble?
---
Hit-or-miss i guess they never miss huh. You got a boyfriend i bet he doesnt kiss ya ( sorry couldn't Ressist after reading hit or miss in your post ) 
---
It's certainly doable but you would get there way faster with much less effort and a lot less risk by just sticking to station trading.
---
Imagine putting um in a shako instead of ist lmao
---
Maybe if you had an ehoz and put a zod in that instead of an um but if you're not a bad you'd get a evortex exile.
---
God I miss d2.
---
Tactical Voltage is also correct, Tactical Wattage has been getting thrown around since we added The Watchmen to the coalition 
---
Sounds more like don't ask for things you want because you know they will fuck them up.
---
A thing of beauty!
---
Do you have a Zune tattoo on your arm too?
---
we live in a society
---
The places I went were either free or symbolic, mostly to have for gasoline to drive to competitions and such, rest was covered with sponsors, city, municipality etc. You probably dont want to go to places where they charge too much also for the reason that they are commercialy interested in what they do, if they were any good they would have students capable of winning comeptitions and thus getting sponsors. I did not knew that lgbt charities would help with that, but, if it works ...
---
I don't know the specifics of why BASTION had a weak showing but sometimes timers conflict with other things a group is doing that they care about more than a timer for some starfruit in Outer Ring.

In rust we trust.
---
I've only lost a frigate once to a super. I think I'll recover.  
---
But yeah this just one example of how absolutely uninformed you are to share your opinion on the subject. Playing 7 years, with 700 kills, living mostly in an F1 blob setting alliance. You're an absolute krab who thinks carriers used to have scram drones and you are still arguing with me. You absolute pleb.
---
That is awesome, congrats, have not decided on mine yet.  
---
i don't think they were expecting it to be defended
---
You win I can no longer argue about how people who track, hunt, and sexually abuse children are bad people and how those who prey on our societies weakest members don’t deserve the chance to do it again.  
---
Well my post is about eve and human trafficking, but ok. I'll wait for a joke-oriented thread about eve and human trafficking and try again. 
---
I mean the drones that scram don't exist and never did. You claimed capitals used to have those. They never did. They were never used. You were wrong.  
---
Why are you so inept that you keep bringing up 3 man gangs defanging supers. Nobody is arguing for that.  
---
"Hunting exists, chasing exists." Brilliant contribution to the discussion. Doesn't address the point.  
---
Why do low IQ krab plebians always post in these threads and argue when they are absolutely clueless about basic game mechanics.
---
Now if you ever do stream, or appear in any TV shows, and that tattoo shows up, you have to pay CCP half of your earnings. 
---
Yeah nice, I'd say I cared for your opinion but that'd be a lie
---
Mhmm to which I said I was wrong it's been a fair few years so... I mean that happens. And again I have had many toons over the years since I have been playing you just seem to weirdly assume this is my only account or toon as if alts never existed which is really weird.  Again with that assuming shit mate. Really need look in on that. If I'd known better you might assume the man in a van with candy really had candy. 
---
Pleb nice one. Original. This is my last response since you seem.functionally incapable of having a conversation. Or debate calling it an argument. And constantly assume you know an entire individuals eve career by one toons name and pvp history. A single account can have up to three slots you know, and people can and do.make second and third and so on accounts. So...theres that.
---
Anyways your a waste of space and time.
---
Casual self brain surgery. Nice.
---
90% of the time when NC form to counter init, init either leave (because it's easy in booshers) or bring the rest of the imperium leaving the nc stuka counter nullified.
---
inject skills, get rorq, mine 35b, inject new char,get rorq, mine 35b, rinse repeat.
---
Helps if you got in the party on day 1 with 6 already max rorq chars and a decent isk pile already.
---
Why worry about tracking frigs when they’re in smartbomb range.
---
Great....my leg is going to get copy striked 
---
Nah man, clearly it's pointless to argue with you because you reply to actual arguments and criticisms with pointlessly trying to offend the person you're arguing with by attacking them personally. It's called an ad hominem attack and it's what you use when your real argument has little substance, or you lack the capability of using an actual argument. This is beautifully illustrated by your last line. What does my singular example have anything to do with the greater subject of what we're talking about?
---
You're not arguing, you're shit posting. Have a great day.
---
Look .. those are going to catch on, you'll see
---
The Joke

I wish I’d known about fitting skills and the impact they have on what you can and can’t fit on your ship. 
---
*front hole 
---
Actually it does work. We lost a raven fleets agains horde coms some time ago. Well we were doing an npc sotiyo too!!
---
Okay so post your most pvp active character.  
---
This should be good.
---
It's also a fitting thing. An officer webifier needs upwards of 1750 pwg. A faction web needs 1 pwg.
---
So if you can get a faction web to match a officer web, it's way more usable, especially on a huginn or rapier. 
---
Also, not all things have officer mods, such as cap batteries or a hivaa. 
---
We won't care :)
---
I've got a corpse called that. He too trusted the rust.
---
This is more for fighting small boosh fleets.
---
We didn't care. Lol. It was something to do. 
---
Stick it in a cola bath every now and then to take care of the oxidation 
---
I found my old Eve account, I don't know If I should continue playing on that account, or I should create a new account. (I haven't played since ages and I would like to have a tutorial.)
---
I have ~13m ISK and [1.6m skill points](https://imgur.com/vo76UI9). 
---
in rust we trust!
---
No, it really wasn't.
---
&gt;Well, the times people randomly bomb our own fleet 
---
Probably easier to talk about the times they don't
---
Immunity to tracking disruption. Otherwise it would lower their application enough so they wouldn't be able to apply to frigates that well. I think that was the plan B to hinder fighters right after the ECM nerf. IDK what's the meta right now, probably n+1.
---
The importance of using faction ammo for pvp, when and where t2 ammo should be used and what size cap boosters to use for different fits.
---
You are thy enemy, but I can't help but admit that it's a fuckin sweet tattoo. o7

"Mines in 4k" Ralph brenting
---
Nah, the focused scrambling script stops them
---
me too
---
yikes
---
that makes sense actually
---
You might have to play it as if it's a job for a while, but I bet it's doable.
---
no thanks
---
The approach is to make so much and accept losses as overhead.
---
This shit is why people buy plex through RMT
---
Keep that account and definitely start a new one. It's all free to pay so you might as well
---
I'm jelly
---
Because they rep each other? For some sites you cannot break the frigs with a single SB
---
That's why they get prison time and mental treatment. But the goal is always resocialization and a lot of effort will be spent to try and accomplish this.  
---
Of course, some people are just so fucked in the head that there's no real solution other than just locking them up until the end of their days.
---
Unfortunately this has all happened before and will again. Pipebombing got nerfed into the ground and now we've lost RnK and basically the last tool the few had to fight the many. When there were several ways to avoid being pipebombed.. But no, people whined that their 300 man battlecruiser fleet wasnt invincible, so CCP responded by removing tactical diversity from the game. If this continues to happen with things like boosting, eventually the game will be nothing but a boring formulaic N+1 grinder for everyone.
---
It's pretty well set up to play for free at the moment. It sounds like you're looking for more of a niche game play style. Eve has apparently been dying for 15years, so you may need to wait a while 
---
Getting killed by your own corpies on a super gatecamp. Thats the worst.

Train up the Anchoring skill and by a few deployable bubbles. Set up at a gate and wait for the fish to come to you
---
Cost should be at the forefront of any ship fitting.
---
For Instance, someone in the Bringing Solo Back chat channel said why not replace the damage control for an IFFA and the Compact afterburner for a T2 on this fit:
---
    [Rifter, Rifter - Dual prop]
---
    Small Ancillary Armor Repairer
---
    Damage Control II
---
    Counterbalanced Compact Gyrostabilizer
---
    
---
    Initiated Compact Warp Scrambler
---
    1MN Y-S8 Compact Afterburner
---
    5MN Quad LiF Restrained Microwarpdrive
---
    150mm Light AutoCannon II
---
    Small Transverse Bulkhead I
---
    Small Projectile Burst Aerator II
---
Although this is a 55m/s speed increase to the afterburner, for a relatively small resistance hit, it crucially increased the cost of the fit to 13.4mil, an increase of 4.2mil from what it originally was. At some point, there needs to be a cutoff on how much you should spend on a ship. As a general rule of thumb, I would never spend more than 10mil in total for a T1 frigate + its fit.
---
How did pipebombing get nerfed? I think i missed this
---
Let your fear of losing ships go. It inevitable. Unless your game is sitting in stations and playing the market you will lose your ship. Maybe not today, or tomorrow, but it will happen. Once you can accept it and be ok with losing a ship, the game will be much more enjoyable. With over 100m isk, you shouldnt have a problem getting yourself a few extra Herons for Exploration. 
---
A wise man once said "You are not entitled to your loot". If having to run back to HighSec after every site to dump your loot means securing it, then that's the way it is until you come up with a better plan. Eve takes time and patience. If you've made over 100m isk in just 4 days, then you're definitely doing something right.
---
Some day, you will be the one wecking someone and taking their loot. :)
---
You're gambling if you're afking t5s
---
Considering the implants are all 1m3, I always assumed they were external processors that interfaced with and augmented the brain from a mount in the pod itself.
---
Changes to grid sizes and I believe drag bubbles as well.
---
Works for me ! :D I've already made over two times my ships worth so anything else is extra

My very first ship I was proud enough to undock for PVE was a Cormorant with two or three different kinds of rails. Just happened to be what I had in the hangar. 
---
How can you not see that these clearly have different interfaces?
---

Not hard. Sites are easy. Probably closer to 2.5b (because haw and cap guns) but they don't need to be 4b or so. 
---
Looks like someone is only using a Limited Ocular Filter
---
Burn the heathen! 
---
The ships I lose to capitals can be replaced. The parts of my soul that I lose from reading stainguy can never be replaced.
---
Well the missile guidance seems better for soloing, but because target painters help for both of your characters, they're better if you're focusing your damage on the same target. Just according to quick pyfa test with T2 modules. Although there might be a small variations depending on your skills.
---
The day after he biomasses over not having the gate it will appear in the patch notes just you wait and see.

because its the internet and people are stupid like that.

Oh god, this was great

Conversely, you can’t ignore cap.

Ill help out ill just need the POS password
---
I believe you, but what are the conditions to determine this? I still do it reflexively unless it’s pure kitey and I’m not planning on taking any/much damage. 
---
Here's a better question. How does a chip in your head affect the thickness of your ships armor? 
---
To some extent, true. But getting a bit more buffer on an active tank ship can be ok/necessary. 
---
Soooo many exceptions. Lmk how that explo Nestor works for you. 
---
I learned this today, and so far the only system with a description I've found is 37S-KO...

If you manage to find one of those lists, I'd be glad if you share it with a fellow lore friend =)

You forgot to bring a drake. 
---
Fuck you.

-Ammatar, probably
---
I didn’t train advanced weapon upgrades 5 until I had 70m+ SP.... there should be a way to see “how to get more &lt;abc&gt;” when fitting and something won’t fit. 
---
I still don’t understand when to use different booster sizes. Please explain?
---
Thats when the videos are made.
---
I know

#triggerwarning Hedliner. INIT is the New PL. Without their elitism.
---
My original argument was.... he's going to get it coming for him in prison.... most of the prison population attacks these kinds of convictions and there is a good portion of the world who would rather see a pedo get wacked rather than simply be behind bars
---
i don't see what's hard to understand about that. but yes... smoothbrain you are, i can't even put together your argument.... im going to assume you clearly see him being behind bars good enough despite the damage he could have done.
---
But at the end of the day, your opinion is irrelevant.. because assuming he is convicted and is put in with general population there wont be much left of him by the end regardless of your views
---
I would really like to see how this goes, you have my support man.

What is Booshing?
---
I should have listened to you.
---
Armor on eve ships isn't just metal plating, but something with nano liquids or something inside. Being able to manipulate said stuff more efficiently makes your armor more efficient.
---
What? No you need shield buffer then active armor and active hull. What even are rigs?
---
Don't worry about the random Sabres on D-Scan either, they won't be able to kill you.
