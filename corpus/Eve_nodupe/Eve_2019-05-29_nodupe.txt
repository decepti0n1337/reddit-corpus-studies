CCP was very upfront with saying it was a website error, if it was a strike on my account or something of that nature I would have said so.
---
---
---
That does look really cool.
---
I don't know where you get that idea from. Sounds like CCP were perfectly happy for him to run again next year, if he wasn't eligible they would likely tell him.
---
This. In terms of high class (the place where “doorstopping” is done the most often) it means specifically putting a rolling cap through then cloaking on the opposite side within jump distance so they can close the hole immediately.
---
comment and subscribe buttons soon to come.
---
You yourself stated that your friend couldn't share the communique with CCP. Sounds like your friend is hiding something from you. Or he screwed up his submission.
---
thats never how its worked in the history of eve
---
Simple wording change: "Triglavian presence is low. The World Ark cannot be detected."
---
are you talking about our sigil again...cause you know that if you touch that sigil we will tickle torture you with enyos till you explode
---
Today I logged in for a few minutes, got a good fight and won it. Still downvoted, just because I could.
---
Listen the devs work hard to make the game. Insulting them isn't going to get anything done. There is likely a reason why the changes were made. If you don't like it then feel free to give feedback, but whining about your perceived stupidity if the UI designers on Reddit won't do a thing.
---
Stage one doesn't scram on the gates, so unless you're on autopilot you should be fine.
---
I never understood how a game with such a flexible avatar builder - which is rarely seen outside a postage stamp icon - has such a bewilderingly limited and random corp logo builder. I could even forgive the choice of shapes, but the colour palette just makes no sense.
---
You take the absolute most risk averse stance to your entire gameplay. You dropping dreads is not the norm, it is only when you have others with you and you freeload off of their work.
---

---
You want me to roam? Sure, but do I have to welp dreads or can I engage subcaps and win for a while until the hammer drops? Because if you are in a subcap, you RUN from any possible fight. I know this because I have chased you out of systems with just a single subcap, you were too scared to engage.
---
Put the undock button in the bottom left hand corner.

Breaking news: players complain about everything.
---
  I remember when people were in an uproar over the new ship overview icons...
---
Those are rookie numbers! Gotta get those up!

/r/eve: "REEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
It's a timer. It's literally just a timer. I'm baffled at how people find it annoying at all, but not any of the other bajillion timers you get every time you shoot something.
---
[deleted]
---
Kinky...
---
Strange, I see no count down. How does this classify as a timer?
---
Hey can you all stop being poor? It's making me uncomfortable.
---
WHAT?!?  
---
Where's my pitchfork?
---
He has described his conversation with the CCP employee managing CSM applications as 'civil and pleasant' and while the result was not to his liking he said he's been told he's welcome to try again next year. If you have a bit of a wander around the comments you'll see he said that in a couple locations.
---
if you ever wondered where the arguments for eugenics come from just look at ccp apologists
---
You can d-scan and probe them down, but yeah… if you want to just randomly warp around, you're allowed to do that. The game won't stop you from doing something dumb.
---
Does anyone have one of these but for spending money on warframe so I can send it to a friend
---
Glad you've taken the point of this discussion to heart.
---
It's in the exact same location, with the exact same size, and the same function. Of course it doesn't have a countdown, because it's indefinite as long as someone is paying. Still a timer. Don't see how a lack of a countdown somehow makes it worse. I guarantee you that you wouldn't be complaining if it was a circle instead of a diamond.
---
What other EVE gems were there?
---
It's really not a dumb idea. Not everyone who plays Eve reads Reddit or the forums. Half of the posts on here say Eve is dying. Customer Satisfaction is a huge part in player retention. Player retention = Eve not dying. 
---
BTW for everyone clicking the thumbs down.. you can down vote it all you want.. they take a baseline and then compare results to the baseline. Source: have been in customer satisfaction and net promoter statistics for 10 years.
---
They are also coincidentally the last AT ships ever to be released.
---
Pardon me, I identify as an attack helicopter.
---
I wouldn't say a desynced probe scanner was a derp, especially in a fight as technical as hacs vs boosh stukas/ravens.
---
&gt; You take the absolute most risk averse stance
---
Nobody has an obligation to give anyone fights except PvE'ers, because they are making money off the environment which is supposed to be risky to create ganks and fights.
---
&gt; I know this because I have chased you out
---
You asking me to deliberately engage your PvP ship in my 0 tank Pontifexes is like me asking you to deliberately engage my Naglfars with your Rorquals. You're expecting me to do things with my ships that they weren't designed to do. That's idiotic. I ask CCP to create situations to make it riskier for the Rorqual. Not because I think you should change your behavior, but because PvE in null is supposed to be risky to generate content in the very design of this game.
---
&gt; You dropping dreads is not the norm, it is only when you have others with you and you freeload off of their work.
---
Having others they play with doesn't make anyone's activity risk averse. People do hunting I provide DPS. Doing both is a lot of work. Fuck us for having a division of labor.
---
&gt; risk averse
---
Risk aversion is essentially measured by what you do with your money. We literally suicide We drop titans and supers (not in Delve) in small fleet whaling in heavily baitable situations. A typical Goon linemember farms titans for months to never use outside the safety of 900 more titans being in range. You can't talk to me a single word about risk aversion.
---
Write shit posts get shit responses.
---
Someone with no knowledge of the game or community would think this sub was overrun with Eve haters just here to talk shit. And they're not wrong, but the haters are the players.  
---
What a fascinating community.
---
hahahaha dumbo
---
What? I'm not wrong!
---
Look how many pontifexes Olmecca lost while booshing excavators and tell me he was being risk averse.
---
Ok
---
Your whole post was in defense of the game we all play because you think its your game and don't like people talking bad about it. We see it every time someone criticizes the game. Weaklings like you feel the need to defend so you can feel like a good guy... you are not and you and people like you the weaklings are why we the players cant get a good patch. You are aids... fuck you
---
Got plenty of good, constructive and reasonable responses from other people... But of course, there's always gotta be a special snowflake or two.
---
He got sloppy and got caught while literally only attacking PvE ships. He will not engage people in proper PvP setups because he knows he will lose.
---
https://market.fuzzwork.co.uk/appraisal/
---
I don't think you have a clue what risk is, or how it is that you strive to avoid it. This is why you should not be on the CSM, you can't see the forest for the trees.
---
do like the art team and just splash random shit on it
---
I'm glad that you decided to run this time so I can laugh when you get fewer votes than Xenuria.
---
Here's my credit card.  Gimme
---
These things feel like resource wars 3.0.  I know this is supposedly only stage 1, but they're literally worse isk than level 3 missions but require a fleet.
---
He does not post under Mort, so I'm supposed to assume who some nobody is? I'm not saying a nobody ingame (even though the vast majority of players have never heard of him), just here.
---
And yes, I get the irony of posting under the name I am using, it was requested that I stop shitposting on my main account so have decided to use this moniker for the time being, at least until the war in the North is concluded.
---
spreadsheeeeeets in spaaaaaace
---
Each of us lives in constant turmoil, thorn apart inside between the love for the people that gave us this amazing, generous and creative community and the best game ever, and our hate to that same people that refuse to reach the full potential (in each redditor's mind ofc) of the game and made us share a big part of our lifes with this unbelievably annoying, sociopathic and loud community.
---
Love you all, go fuck yourselves.
---
Now average that out over the time it takes Zorya to spawn, and you won the loot lottery.  We killed it 3 times and got less than 5m in loot per spawn, no books or anything.  Worse isk/h than level 2 missions.  
---
Also, due to terrible salvage aggression mechanics + high sec, people can steal your salvage and there's not really anyhting you can do about it without getting concorded.  Putting all value into salvage in high sec is absolutely retarded.
---
Lol if anything the value of the salvage will tank after a week.
---
Actually I would. The thing is right in that top corner is other actually important things:
---
Jump fatigue
---
Aggression timer
---
Those 2 are very important in bull sec. usually I use peripheral vision to see if they are there whilst I watch overview and d-scan. Now the above mentioned actual timers are red/orange and so is this new one. You see the issue? War status has no impact in a fight, at all, your already in the shit. It can be easily mistaken for aggression or timer.
---
Hi,
---
I closed your bug report for now, as this is unfortunately a feature request and not a bug. I was asking for a bug report about being unable to disable the popup for undocking, as this should be working. 
---
Nevertheless, I will discuss your feature request with the team and we'll see if can improve this, without making it too confusing or complicated (each option adds a bit of complexity, and brings the risk of extra bugs) and without spending too much time.
---
There is no risk for the salvagers, you can't shoot ninja salvagers without getting concorded.
---
We had a group of 4 Nestors and a drek, the Nestors would rep each other and assist the drones to the drek and the drek would essentially slow boat around blasting ships. The drek also loaded a burst for Rapid Repair to make the logi from the Nestors and bit better.   
---
Also, the books dropped from normal Leshaks, not the faction variant.
---
Hmm you must be unlucky, I killed 3 Zarya's so far and each one has dropped at least 100 mil. That being said they're super easy to find, just find a system less than 14 AU from centre and use dscan to see literally everything. 
---
Found 3 Zorya in 1 system this way. Hopefully when the invasion upgrades it gets better, concord LP apparently with the rifts from tier 2 invasion but right now its a bit bugged because well, of course it is.
---
Your complaints are lazy.
---
&gt; I don't think you have a clue what risk is
---
Likewise. That is why I'm not running to represent people like you.
---
Skill injectors, not even once.
---
As an alpha who hit his 5M skill point training limit, I guess this is the only way for me (considering the money here is ISK).
---
There are actually a lot of players running Eve on Linux, like myself.
---
I appreciate your testing, but I will probably wait for quite a while before using the 64 bit version.
---
Fair enough but I see no mention of pop ups for docking/undocking so I’m confused where you pulled that from and honestly concerned if this is a standard for addressing issues that are perceived by CCP and not the ones brought to them via tickets or reddit discussion. Making of assumptions for this sort of thing is what gives players not much faith in CCPs ability to deliver what the community needs (fixes) rather than what the CCP team thinks it needs (UI changes not documented on patch notes for example).
---
Thank you for the effort and I hope this just gets a ‘right click &gt; do not show this anymore’ option or a checkbox to hide it
---
It's /u/epicloa I think
---
A gold magnate was lost a few weeks ago
---
You must be new to the game. There is never a break down of the kind of event mechanics. It's up to players to figure it out. Knowledge is power in this game. They silver platter enough already. HTFU!
---
I’m looking for a freighter alt fren
---
Chicken little?
---
I thought the plex sink was going to be removing Papa Johns ads from alpha accounts and unlocking more SP or otherwise making an alpha account capable of buying unlocks piecemeal. $500 deep before you have a forever-free character that can fly one ship that alphas normally can't. I'd be dumb enough to pay.
---
&gt;because a cheap nestor reps literally twice as much as a guard, with 3 times the buffer, and no cap chain micro and would effectively take a tali bhaal of neut pressure to make it stop repping?
---
Youre forgetting the proportions of loot, most people wont get such a drop because of loot stealing, ninja salvage, and running in big fleets, still a majority of people right now are not getting any loot.
---
Slippery slope
---
Gotta say, I literally joined the guys over at Stranger Danger (Almost Dangerous) 3 days ago after being in Karma Fleet for almost a year, and I've already had more fun in 3 days than most of my time in Karma Fleet. Is KF bad? Nope! I've made great friends in Goonswarm, but man, the content and community in WH's has been really great. No regrets, and so far the moving process was MUCH easier than I ever expected. Looking forward to what content is to come :)
---
Lol they will be the only ones doing it
---
Mostly about drug production, because it is still a slightly arcane process compared to other EVE production. That's always easy all-bait and got the sub in top-100 a couple times from it.
---
I bid two bits.
---
Didn't spot that undock button, then?
---
It was once you figured out how to run them. 
---
Using Thrashers to pop the overshield and draw the DD would keep expensive BS from popping. After that you just DPSed them down. Early attempts just tried to focus on keeping everyone alive like they do for normal Incursions. Finally a group figured out "Why not just let them pop a cheap ship"? The Thrasher was cheap fit and could sometimes sig tank the DD.  The amount lost was easily paid for by the elements that dropped and everyone kept their payout. 
---
I'm betting they're rolling this one out in phases to see if anyone can exploit them before they dump all the rewards in. Better to find out if they can be farmed beforehand rather then cause a massive ISK faucet like they did with the Drifters.
---
1) You're taking a great risk here of this post not aging well.
---
2) Any vote I'll get above 300 will be because someone believed in my ideas as that's all I'm running with. It won't be due to a meme, some guy telling them, or me advertising my irrelevant RL position. I'd still be proud if I had less votes than Xenuria.
---
3) My comment about your candidacy arises from how shitty you're treating the very people you promised to represent. The very double standard of how you were running, you'd be smiling at them, telling them you'd be representing their worries. Your comment about mine arises from who you're (not) friends with. Makes the difference with nullbears and others pretty salient.
---
&gt; If you want to make 100K+ a year you're working for a corporation that does not care what you like or what is better 
---
This is demonstrably false, but I understand the point of your post.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I genuinely feel that CCP wants to make a game that appeals to the broadest audience available. This stands to reason as the broadest audience affords the largest paying player base. If folks find themselves frustrated because the direction of the game doesn't include them, that is entirely relevant. But make your case clearly and stress that your demographic adds to a substantial portion of the revenue stream in the same fashion that you would arguing a raise at work. It sounds silly, but both conversations involve why an incorporated entity should divulge more of their already appropriated money toward your interests instead of where they were originally planned.
---
I understand the sentiment of canceling your account and moving on. I've done it numerous times in the past 13 years (it obviously didn't stick). But do it with class or stake your claim with **sound** (a button to turn off the patch isn't sound) suggestions.
---
Targeting / aggression range?
---
To be quite honest, I thought this feature was a reddit troll until I logged on today.
---
1) It was a joke. 
---
2) You guys have 300 omega accounts?  I'm impressed.  Regardless of how many votes you get more than 300, you're still going to lose. 
---
3) Your comment about my candidacy arises from the fact that you a humorless person.
---
I had a button for it on the old UI. But it changed.
---
&gt; 3) Your comment about my candidacy arises from the fact that you be a humorless person.
---
Nah I was actually joking this entire comment tree. You're humorless for not getting it.
---
They wanted to remove Concord in highsec? WTF 
---
I never heard of this ... I would probably have discovered it after jumping a freigther into an invasion system.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

They're clearly trying to foster mystery. Let's see how not unfolds.

What? Do the Triglavain NPCs who do the gate camping also point and scram???
---
It's in the same spot as all the timer icons already show up, so it's not taking up any extra space. Moderately annoying in its presence, but not reducing screen real-estate.
---
I think its cute.

Same here, have lodged a bug report.
---
It's hard set to 90% where I normally play windowed and 125% scaling.

It is, take a cheap fit and try it for yourself if you'd like! I think one can recreate it as long as they're watching the timer and are in Room 2, and jump with like 1 second left.
---
If you undock they will go to cargo bay.
---
Except it gives a popup warning and halts autopilot when you try to use a jump gate into an Invasion system too.
---
Thanks for doing the heavy lifting, I'm pretty sad I thought this was going to be some really fun pve content.

This is gayer than 8 guys screwing 9 guys.

Nope, I was out scanning earlier without any problems.

Dishonorable PvP is the only PvP that matters in eve.

How do I find a corp that isnt half way across the galaxy? As a returning player i feel like a corp is the best way for me to get back into the game.
---
Many people don't need it.  You live in null and war dec doesnt matter
---
Yep, piece of shit was fine after I upgraded to 64 bit launcher, but then after a couple hours all of my accounts disappeared.  Re-added a few, closed launcher, and just reopened it and they're all gone AGAIN.  How can CCP get such basic shit SO FUCKING WRONG?  I have never seen a gaming company with such a terrible launcher, and this thing has gone through like 10 iterations...
---
Noob here, gonna try now
---
The worst part is, with CCP's apparent lack of resources (since it takes them 5 years to do basic changes and have no community team), they can still waste dev time on something this stupid.  Yeah, I'm sure it's not much dev time, but dev time nonetheless.  Those 3 minutes could have fixed one of the million little things that could use a touchup in game.
---
Thanks for sharing! Keep up the content!
---
Try Alt+P
---
Nah, let them commute back and forth between Niarja as well
---

---
Sort of, yeah.  There were easy exploits, but the "intended" way to do them had next to no rewards VS the risk.  Had they not been removed, assume the exploits would be fixed, and you'd just be left with the trash.  Guess I should clarify, nobody ran them the intended way because they were trash.
---
Change for the sake of change is not justified 
---
Change for clarification or QoL purposes makes sense, but these Ui changes do neither
---
The caveat though is its kind of pointless, because people are not really going to find exploits if they're not worth running.  People tend to optimize when there's, you know, a reason to.
---
Yeah, I’m surprised anyone actually made it through this clusterfuck of a post. Even so, a lot of these “good, constructive” responses are criticizing you on how you decided to challenge the reddit character limit.
---
Wow
---
r/nocontext
---
&gt; Nobody has an obligation to give anyone fights except PvE'ers
---
Holy double standards batman. "Involuntary pvp for thee but not for me."
---
&gt;You asking me to deliberately engage your PvP ship in my 0 tank Pontifexes is like
---
You sound exactly like the krabs you hate here.
---
Did it occur to you the reason there is no explanation of it is that the reason is not known to the empires? They cannot tell you what they do not know. The mechanics and systems around the invasion have all been left shrouded in mystery. Why should the red system be any different? That's actually fully RP. It'd be way weirder if they knew from day zero why what's happening is happening.
---
same with the t4/t5 supposed change... you and all the other dead gilas
---
Savage
---
That sounds just as cancerously tedious.
---
"People taking PvP risks for PvE rewards" is inherent to the very design of this game mate. Believe it or not there is a reason why CONCORD doesnt exist in every space. We don't ask krabs to change their behavior and engage our dreads with their rorquals. Neither we ask them to not defend their space nor not drop titans on our frigates. We ask CCP to balance the game according to the very principle I just mentioned.
---
I'm just getting into wormholes. After scanning, do I change my fit for combat/mining sites from a general combat or mining fit? I assume only my scanning ship would cloak.
---
LMAO
---
You're going to slowboat 10000km to a site in a recon? Have fun.
---
been gone for several years, did I miss a massive fucking war this past winter
---
If the market is immature, as it is here, the in game value isn't going to be much, as it is here. As time goes on, the price will normalize and show the correct in-game value.
---
Thanks, I'll try to improve too ;)
---
Sure it has. As an example, the price of the glamourex boosters on release day was little, then the price normalized to a higher value as people understood their value better (and the EVEO and reddit threads helped).
---
You pay to have it instant, everyone is able to get there yet others may choose the regular training route. And there's always going to be player skills involved, no matter now much character skillpoints they have.
---
&gt; GL with account retrieval should you ever get hacked.
---
Yeah olmeca the way to get people to agree with you is to remind us that CCP's shit like anyone else's can be hacked while in the same comment wanting more tie-in between accounts and RL info. This is why you get called a retard so often FYI
---
Just started playing again since 09. I hit it today after mining. I like the new UI changes personally.
---
Market details on the other hand could use some more stuff.

Can confirm krypted is in J-Space. I accidentally found myself initiating a delivery &gt;4999m from the B274 just yesterday. I quickly realized my mistake and warped back, but not before being yellowboxed by a krypted pilot.

Happy to have you in J-Space!
---
what the shit is this
---
&gt; CCP don't give a shit about EVE, more news at 11. 
---
There, I fixed that for you,  friend
---
&gt; He will not engage people in proper PvP setups because he knows he will lose.
---
I'm not exactly that twat's biggest fan, but are you seriously trying to bitch about "muh pvp setup" when he's hunting in a region where if you dare bring in a cruiser gang you will get supers dropping on you and titans setting up to boson you on gate? If you're going to make your region utter cancer to ever try something that resembles PVP in you should expect people to just go for your krabs.
---
If I'm asking from CCP to do what literally every other game company does, and getting called a retard as a response, it's probably because some people but in this subreddit are toxic af my friend.
---
Maybe not for you, but maybe it's for new players who jump in and have no idea what to do. QOL can't just be all about the rusted on experienced players with super alts
---
Yeah sweetie it's the evil mean internet bullies, not you &lt;3
---
Whats it like to waste 10 years of your life?
---
The bank account isn't complaining.
---
So something strange was hapoening where i had about 8 instances of the launcher on task manager. Closed them all, started it up, no problems since. Don't know the cause but so far seems fine.
---
Because ~~scum~~ ninja looters
---
I love this story
---
I was there, but on the other side obviously. Nice music choice in this video.
---
Nah it's just members of one toxic space cult culturally hating people. I wouldn't blame the internet.
---
&gt; We don't ask krabs to change their behavior and engage our dreads with their rorquals. Neither we ask them to not defend their space nor not drop titans on our frigates.
---
Instead you ask for it to be impossible. See here:
---
&gt;We don't blame people for their behavior but demand game balance from CCP.
---
&gt;You can't twist the risk aversion talk back to hunters. They are the very risk in the game that you are supposed to take. If you make the game riskier for them you make it safer for the general populace which is bad.
---
Hunters absolutely can be risk averse. I don't think that's you but they are out there. And hunting the hunters should in fact be a thing if you like it or not. I would absolutely get into hunting if i could relentlessly hunt people like yourself instead of helpless PVEers.
---
&gt; I fundamentally do not think that picking a fight with CCP is what people should look for in a CSM. 
---
I mean...isn't this kind of the entire job description of the CSM?  We all know CCP doesn't listen unless something is hammered into them over and over again.
---
A solid write up my dude, the soft-cap mechanics of wormholes truly give it some spice and make tightly knit communities thrive.
---
How do undock spreadsheet?
---
Especially when you're skilling into super carriers and then asking if heavy missiles or rockets are better
---
How much for Escael Zephyrs?
---
I just want the wallet back on the default neocom :/
---
I didn't say risk taking behavior doesnt vary across hunters. I just said hunters don't have to take an inherent risk like krabs. Risk comes with reward. Krabs are the ones getting the reward off the space that's supposed to be dangerous. Hunters are the danger. Hunters often play a minus sum game to get their kills.
---
So all I'm saying is that you can't expect the game to be designed around hunters' risk in the same manner we expect it to be designed such that there is a minimum risk for krabbing in nullsec.
---
non sequitur
---
It really isn't just one space cult.
---
You have to hunt the officer, we got 800m drop in 1.
---
I am a member of a *different* toxic space cult, and I think Olmeca is retarded.
---
AMA
---
It is bud. You are just living in your small bubble.
---
The amount of positive response I got for my video must have eaten so many Goons inside out. For 3 years many of you folks tried to portray things as if the entire Eve hates me like you do.
---
&gt; You are just living in your small bubble.
---
I'm sorry but if my space cult hates you and the goon space cult hates you, that makes at least 2 space cults who hate you. Fucking retard, just learn to accept the fact that it isn't only big bad goonies who don't like you and stop spewing bullshit based on your own inaccurate assumptions.
---
Not really. 
---
Regardless, the idea that you think my making a joke about wormholes complaining (which was made a couple times here already) is me somehow spitting on people I promised to represent (which is actually bullshit - I never campaigned to get wormholer support, I merely offered to help after I won and they didn’t get someone on) is fucking dumb. Don’t be dumb. If you can’t laugh at yourself or take a joke, get out of politics.
---
Hey - this happened to me. Try going to reset settings and then reset window positions - then open the system map and then open your scanner (alt p). I then had to click a button on the probe scanner to "undock" it from the system map. Expansion must have reset settings.
---
GF then :)
---
Thanks, tried royalty free music as the other stuff is such a hassle when your video gets flagged. Not easy finding non-electronic music in the royalty free category. I assume it has to do that you need actual instruments and can't just do it at your PC and mix a song on your own (nothing against electronic music).
---
yes thank you! that worked :)
---
How are the ticks tho
---
No problem - I spent a frustrating few minutes hitting alt+p and f9 with just clicking noises.. very annoying : )
---
ccplease
---
lol
---
The "Everyone who is better than me has no life, everyone who is worse than me is a scrub" argument.
---
&gt;Unless you get enjoyment out of krabbing — in which case pls kys in-game
---
That is exactly the attitude I am talking about. Embrace the sandbox game and stop caring about what other people enjoy.
---
Maybe he really didnt want to do it.
---
I'm not sure how that is relevant. A 5% increase is a 5% increase, regardless of player skill.
---
Yeah, most games don't literally have a button you can pay to hit to win.
---
P2W just means that you can buy advantages in game with rl money.
---
So hypothetically you could live in abyssal space indefinitely... Intended/ hidden featurevsurel!
---
Allright I will concede. There are few groups. Goons because I kill their shit. There are some in BB because I killed their stuff and they are stupid enough to let it go, despite most of BB already did and many even endorsed me for CSM. There are some in HK because years ago I told them their war against drone renters was irrelevant and the real danger was in delve where they should have spent their whaling efforts (and boy was I right lol). 
---
It typically starts with some hateful shitlord flaming at me just because I am saying something right. In our case I literally suggested CCP doing what blizzard, ea, valve or any other company does with accounts, and it was enough for you to begin flaming. I told you if I'm getting called a retard for that, thats because this sub is full of hateful shitlord. Going over your Reddit history confirms that. Half your posts are porn and the other half starts with "you are retarded", therefore hateful shitlord.

Deploying code changes in weekly iteration for an expansion is vastly different then having the deployed state get progressively worse as players progress. The difference is the code has been tested and deployed ahead of time
---
This!
---
Meh i like it
---
R/eve haters gonna hate... Eve dying etc.
---
Jesus you should have stayed banned you piece of garbage
---
"there are few groups"
---
Yes only people in Goons BB or HK can possibly have a negative feeling towards you. God you're pathetic
---
Yeah sue me for killing stuff.
---
This is not a new problem, has been going in for years. The release versions of the launcher regularly forget my accounts. 
---
My settings often get wiped as well - often enough that I now regularly back them up.
---
I'd love to run the sites. What's the meta and is there logi?
---
Lots of shields. And yes we run with logi
---
Haha see what you did there...
---
Boo hoo you have to be in goons to not like me and your post history is mean :(
---
I fly logi in incursions, and enjoy the crap out of it. I see a ship like the Zarmazd and I'm looking for an excuse to train into it so I can fly it. It just seems to be such a niche ship, and nobody has much use with it. Is there a sec of space I can fly this ship and there be enough demand for it?
---
It's pretty bad if you are an explorer.  Even the guy that was able to find me just using the Agency window thought it was lame. Even if I don't get caught everyone knows what I'm doing and what system to find me in.
---
What do you think does the other half of the universe thinks about you? Fucking spod brains
---
I can take a joke or laugh at myself mate (a fact which this comment tree has nothing to do btw). I just don't get yours because they aren't actually funny and it's often unclear that they are jokes.  You did seriously say things like "wormholes were never intended to be lived inside" before, so it's pretty clear you could have as well been serious. How am I supposed to discern? 
---
PS: You did run on the premise of representing everyone and we even had arguments over how that's impossible. Everyone includes wh'ers.
---
Has anyone stopped to consider why they did it? On the one side we want eve to thrive, on the other we criticise every little change.
---
For eve to thrive player retention needs to improve. Watch eve down under hilmar. He gives figures of how many of those 10,000 new pilots every week never return to eve. 
---
Changes such as this are not meant for you all old bitter vets.
---
Shut up and adapt, its not the end of the world.
---
Agency in general is meant to and im sure has as its top priority new player retention. Anything that makes the game more accessible will hopefully keep more newbies around.
---
Flair checks out.
---
Depends if you can log back into it!
---
&gt; they can still waste dev time
---
They fired their community team and then immediately went back to pissing people off. If they do that I don't think they care enough about gathering feedback to make those buttons actually do anything.
---
Show me on your manticore where my electron bomb touched you friend

I can't. I'm not in any of the 3 groups you mentioned but I also don't like you, so according to Olmeca Gold's laws of reality I literally don't exist.

How does eve calculate the approximate price of an item that is shown in the industry tab or the comparison tool?
---
The risk should apply to players doing things in null. Be that krabbing or hunting. Btw the more you say "it doesn't apply to me" the more you sound like a hypocrite not less. 
---
The problem stems from the fact that it's better to turtle up, gather in a defensible position and just do your own thing. Most people aren't going to fight if there isn't anything to fight over, no reason to fight. Resources are so plentiful everywhere that there isn't any reason to fight to get a better deal. 
---
Tipping the balance in your favor won't fix systematic problems.
---
Actually the fact the concord thing wasn’t implemented allows highsec dudes to freely salvage the wrecks stealing the loot from people who did the site without any consequences
---
What types of ships do you run?
---
Risk applies to things you get a monetary reward from. You typically don't get a reward from hunting and it's a minus sum game. If you apply risk to hunters then by definition you diminisb the risk for krabs, which doesn't make sense. Hunters are already taking a minimal risk by choosing to interact with players.
---
It's not a distinction between my activity and others. It's based on a principle: more pve income = more risk. I accept the fact that people can kill me when I do c5 krabbing. And they sometimes do.
---
I miss the ability to flatten the map.  I don't like trying to pick routes in 3d

I like the new undock button...

So much this.

Join the public Trig Invasion fleet and run with them in free time? Most incursion groups are dead and gone these days.
---
Only in highsec.
---
You need to work on your shades. Still needs more work overall. :)
---
Lol what did you want the trigs to come dock at your station and open a trade window offering you all their shit?
---
I keep double clicking and it still doesn’t work!
---
You'll want to change your ship, not your fit. This is true whether you're day-tripping or living in the wormhole. You want to have a dedicated scanning ship (it's good to have spares, or at least spare T1 scanners if your primary scanning ship is expensive). You want to have dedicated rolling ships if you're living in a wormhole. And you'll want to have dedicated ships for any sites you want to run. If we're talking C1-C3, this could be a passive shield fit Myrmidon/Gila/Drake/whatever.
---
LOL, turn that into a mouse pad...
---
God damn it, CCP. Please stop market group auto-expanding. It's driving me crazy.
---
Who would have thought ccp would introduce more shitty pve with trash loot chance where people just steal from each other. It's almost like the npc sotiyo all over again that they refuse to fix. More quality opportunity for game play half assed :(
---
TLDR: Moron re-subs because he thought he could grief high sec'rs without getting blown up?

incorrect. Some of the main systems are close enough to low sec to have them included

r/eve : THIS GAME IS TOO SAFE, ITS RUINING CONTENT AND EVERYTHING IS BORING!!! ccpls

also r/eve: the new UI means that exploration and combat sights are more dangerous, no one will ever use them again. ccpls
---
You are a faggot case dismissed.
---
This is already the case. Highsec DOES feel limited. But when you put new players in that situation, the easiest way out of those "limits" is also out of the game entirely.
---
It's decent as a small gang logi due to all the utility slots and bonuses. Try LS Brawl gangs, or WH Brawls.

This is the part where people tell you to get a life. Of all things to complain about in Eve, you are mad about a fucking skybox.

Nice! That was a really good time
---
I generally use the new map, but the one gripe I truly understand is the inability to "flatten" the map.

what's the reward? do they have bounties or Lp payouts?
---
Not sure yet. Been out for only a day
---
Salvage is good apparently
---
Trouble is too many of them left
---
You rang?
---
for basic i want to go here flat map is great, for exploration in a dense area the 3d mode is awesome in old map. clean crisp and not full of noise like this new shitty one.
---
I’ve advocated for a special ship, a small one, that had 6 to 8 containers that you could put corpses into that you could then sell at a very illegal marketplace to the Sleepers.
---
I suggested it at Fanfest and was met with disgust. Which is justified, but that should not disqualify it as a legitimate [ha!] area of operations for the courageous space entrepreneur.
---
Every sordid element in EVE should be a market opportunity, however foul and deranged it may be.

Why are certain buy orders in the market window shaded green?

Solo guy, can come 1v1 at Sun?

I was able to get an augoror navy issue to ~4700 cargo capacity, enough to anchor a cyno beacon. Use that to cyno in a jump freighter with a larger structure

Well, tbh, in this war, we're yet to drop the big titan hammers in any major way. It's been all subcap fleets mainly in Tribute.

Really?

Yes, bring your Sin, we love big battleships in Delve, especially our scanner/hunter types. :)

Because they originate from the station you are in.

How quick do you clear this waves?I think missiles are not very good if you alpha all of the ships.

Submit a ticket, it is possible and has been done in the past. No guarantees though.
---
Well, sorta.  Without energy shields, they're weakER, but they're still wearing crazy ceramic-titaniaum-unobtanium-ultraplebonium armor.  In the early days of the Human-Covenant war, the Spartan IIs fought in only armor without energy shields.  The energy shields were a tech the Humans didn't develop on their own, they reverse engineered Covenant tech, if I recall correctly (I think a stolen Jackal arm shield, but it might have been an Elite's armor...)
---
Granted, death tolls were still high, but Spartan IIs with NO energy shields were able to go against Covenant forces and win on the ground (it was in space that the Covenant had the UNSC truly outclassed for the most part, except around heavily defended worlds like Reach or Earth with lots of mass driver cannon defensive platforms.)
---
Granted, the Spartan III armor was kind of...discount armor (as was the Spartan IV), but both were still pretty hefty body armor compared to what normal troops or even ODSTs wore.  Spartan IIIs were the weakest, due to them not being bionically enhanced (though they were still physically enhanced).  Their helmets were still full face and head, which would be enough to protect against a single sniper shot, generally (not two, but probably one), and you often get grazed in the game and live from one or even two shots (again, unless you're playing on Legendary.)
---
So a Spartan (even a III) should have been able to take a single shot from that and potentially lived, or at least not died instantly.
---
There's alot of frigates and the misses do a great job of getting all that destroyer and frig do off fast. We have auto cannon gun based battle ships that handle the big stuff along with cruise missiles fit battleships. It's very balanced.
---
Ask people in local, look for local structures, or look at killboards for local systems for active corps. That being said most larger corps will help you move stuff, or at least let you sell what you have and re-buy what you need on-location.
---
Dead Co, the coalition that Panfam bled for multiple times and we abandoned them. They made the deal with Goons because Sort needs to feel important.
---
I agree, but with things dying too fast I didn't bother. If I was trying to teach them fleet tactics then yes, but I wasn't. At most the new players got to cut their teeth on something that can properly fight back.
---
That said, you're correct the execution of the fleet wasn't ideal for teaching people how fleets work. I just didn't want to fight them alone and the content was accessible enough to do it like this.
---

sad i missed it :(

I'm going to downvote the fuck out of it. I feel like I won't be the only one.
---
hahah dae r/all bait xDDDDDDDDD
---
I was USING the previous version of agency, but I guess fuck that right?  Gotta switch to something that gives you all sorts of choices and no direction instead I guess.  -\_-
---
Yea, its nice that there were kinda random things to go chase around. I wish they would have had the sites spawning on day one, rather than I guess having it escalate to that stuff later? I think a lot of people just wont try it again after dealing with little rewards on day one, and mainly stuff coming from the salvage, which is easily just ninjaed in high sec :/ Also LP store looks pretty shit with mainly just skins. Not a good start to keep people interested
---
Wait, so all I need is a counterfit garmur with high-grade snakes and abyssal mods?
---
You have manual piloting plastered all over, is that supposed to be sarcastic?
---
I am not the best pilot but I couldn't have made a worse PvP video if I tried, like holy shit man this is some top tier garbage
---
i don't get it
---
Here we go again
---
Yes
---
Recreating this could be considered an exploit. I wouldn't recommend saying "hey, you should do it too"
---
If you get the chance to salvage, before the ninjas do, apparently hahahaha
---
Delete this please
---
Soon the intel bots will be adjusted. Not only will they be alerted to wormholes, but they will be able to look at alliance member locations cross reference agency data and be alerted when someone is running sites in thier space. Once the bot is running it will require 0 effort.
---
Brutal
---
not really. you're just gonna have to try and see, which is kinda shitty.

Apparently people are incapable of conjuring up an independent thought that doesn't start and end with CCP sucks. I'm quite liking the UI changes.

Which is exactly why I only extract, never inject.
---
I feel like the current corp browser is good enough for that. If CCP starts pushing it more the way you want, I could easily see people gaming the system. And by that, I mean the high-sec sweatshop corps that have like 75% tax that make ISK off milking new players. 
---
Either that, or they all get funneled to the huge null-blocs. Although, to be fair, thats basically what happens now anyway.
---
[removed]
---
By that yardstick then the ability to make more than one char and train them simultaneously is P2W too since there is some advantage that can be gleaned even if marginally. The implication when one says P2W is that there’s a significant advantage, which is simply not true in EvE if you wish to look at the practical application of it. You can spend a fortune on some BS and get owned by a swarm of Alphas if you’re at the wrong time and place. EvE awareness can’t be bought with money.
---
You’d have half a point if everybody flew cruisers that had the same ranges and weapon systems, and then someone bought their extra 5% missile dmg via RL (who says it ain’t Jita profits?) money spent on injectors.
---
As far as being P2W on the continuum EvE comes right after purely cosmetic weapon skins in a game like CSGO.
---
Take hictors along with the fleet, lock up all neutrals spamming points with safety on.
---
Oh, so there actually are set sites? I honestly agree with you, I thought this invasion thing was just going to always be a cluster-fuck of combat probing down random clusters of Trig. ships and just hoping things work out. Not the best way to introduce new content if you ask me.
---
I respect the hustle

---
I don't understand why people think that change is supposed to hurt exploration. Sure you need to adapt your strategy a bit but overall it actually makes exploration more dangerous, because you can use the intel from the agency to hunt explorers.
---
Isk donations are always appreciated, maybe take part in our isk doubling service?

Why would you even want it? This is the last place in the game that is still eve!

---
hi! thanks for your comment! 
---
Yes, it takes a counter fit garmur to catch this orthrus!
---
You are right, i could not use manual kiting to catch this one.  A manual piloting is usually effective against a small fleet, or a slow blobs.
---
thanks again for watching!
---
Because TCUs doesn't mean anything
---
To fight I would say yes a fleet is required. There were however a lot of people in system where we were ninja looting wrecks and ninja salvaging around the fleets just out of range. That’s a possibility.
---
F
---
Just click and drag the icon there? It's like the taskbar in windows.

Do I change the loadout of the combat ship at all? I'm new to popping around low sec/null/whs, and was wondering if I go in there cloaked or warp in guns blazing and mash dscan?

But tbh way the new button looks ... it looks like guy that made it is in NC.             
---
"Like no one will be clicking it anyway so why to put any effort"
---
It's on a delay
---
shoulda figured that out on my own... well thanks lol
---
Getting Omega for one month (roughly double the cost) will give you more than double the amount of SP over that month. Plus all other benefits of Omega.
---
for this case, linked vindi would reach its webs past orbit of all the rats you need to web without moving, but yeah :D
---
Oof could you get any madder?
---
From a pirate perspective - you don't care about being blown up as costs are included in the profit margins.
---
tbh - one of the best things you can do to improve your eve experience is to never read any of the eve community sites.
---
I won't, since it sounds like it's going to be a lot of effort for fuck all reward like the last high sec exclusive pve content that they abandoned.
---
I mean compared to 23/7 rorq mining anything is tedious I guess.
---
I expected interesting and fun content. Literally belt ratting without bounties is the very opposite.
---
Looking to start this game back up. Anyone know any low guilds accepting? Started as caldari
---
Of course you got lots of people, it's release day.
---
Resource wars was the same, look how that turned out.
---
grats on your luck, saw nothing of the sort over like 4 hours of grinding with 10k dps
---
It can hardly be called P2W. You don't get 5% more dmg over anyone else. You get to spend less time to get that 5%. Someone who've played for 5 years and have all relevant skills and someone who've played for 1 year and have bought skill injectors to get all those relevant skills are in equal footing when it comes to skill.
---
The only thing that can be called pay 2 win is Omega clones where you can actually get that 5% more damage compared to an alpha clone.
---
yeah
---
Great article, makes me want to return to wormholes now...
---
Yes but the mechanics made it accessible enough to just go and shoot things that can actually fight back. Thatt's what I thought was good for new players.
---
That's a-cute idea
---
If we're talking about shooting sleeper NPCs, I like to have a cloak, probe launcher, probes, and mobile depot in my cargo hold. (It's my "wormhole survival kit".) But I won't have it fit when I'm trying to run sites. If I recall correctly, you can pretty much warp in to the anom at zero for C1-C3 sites. (This is generally not true for C5 sites, by the way.)
---
Armor tanked gun/drone boats should work fine. I suspect you're better off with a passive regen shield tanked drone boat because sleepers neut pretty hard. You may find [this resource](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17cNu8hxqJKqkkPnhDlIuJY-IT6ps7kTNCd3BEz0Bvqs/pubhtml#) useful when trying to figure out which sites you can run. Don't neglect the gas sites! Their defenders are reasonably lucrative and all spawn right on the sig, so you can use close range setups for those.
---
Ninja-salvaging is currently rather profitable. The loot dropped is fairly bad though.
---
I dont think you understand how bots work. There is no need for ESI if u want them to read shit on screen
---
That's because salvaging isn't an aggressive act. It's just a pain as that is where the loot is at just now.
---
Sure, but it doesn't matter how accessible it is if the content isn't worth doing.
---
Look at RW. T1 frigs and ventures were all you needed. Yet, it has been abandoned by both ccp and the players
---
This don't sound right......
---
Can i bring my shield orca?
---
OK, but you send me a deposit first
---
They keep paying the sov bills and nobody have evicted them yet
---
I agree, but that doesn't invalidate what good content there is here, let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater
---
Yep me.
---
You may laugh but there are genuine skills that translate from eve to real life. I pretty much had to quit the game because of this, I have barely any free time.
---
You see I used to fly logi. The skills I developed as a logi pilot, prioritising the needs and well being of others, being attentive and caring were perfect for a real life career as a gigolo but not a jugalo, there's a fine line that must never be crossed. Now I travel the world with attractive bored middle aged women, fulfilling their every whim and they dress me up like a toy and use me as their play thing.
---
fly safe, don't tell them where you live
---
I've had this happen a few months ago. So it seems to be an issue with the launcher base code and not just this release.
---
About three fiddly
---
I heard the undock button is greyed out if you are in NC.
---
Can I bring my logi rorqs and amass dank salvage ticks while you nerds kill the rats
---
Invasions will not be abandoned by players because they drop stuff needed for T2 triglavian ship production that cannot be obtained anywhere else and there's definitely going to be sustained demand for that; the market value of their drops will stabilize at a level that makes it worthwhile for some players to run them. The problem with resource wars is that there's no demand for its unique loot (random garbage skins) and all its non-unique loot can be farmed more effectively by other means.
---
Assuming that you can undock every 30s ... that's like :       
---
* 60mil/h for 2 accounts (1 char for poddng )          
---
* 120mil/h for 3 accounts           
---
* 180mi/h for 4 accounts
---
Ahh, so its 100x easier than regular sansha incursions than?
---
Tell that to ccp. Resource wars was very easy to make not shit, but decided to sack it off instead of make it better. Same with drifter incursions. Complete lack of effort in iterating on things with potential to chase the next shiny thing to abandon.
---
Can't wait for my bomber skills to complete in 10 days!
---
I didn't think this would be the response they'd get...
---
Yeah, and the very simple fix was to just add stuff to the lp stores. Not exactly difficult.
---
But no, ccp would rather abandon it. As they do time and time again.
---
Can you pastebin it?
---
yes
---
I wish I was at fanfest to help support your idea.
---
Corpse trading is and should be considered as a legitimate business.
---
Try in EUtz , best chance to get the gate to the pvp room
---
I mean... removing concord from high sec would be weird, thats the whole point of high sec
---
https://pastebin.com/N5MNJKxf
---
*CCP DEV: Concord won't respond to attacks in a system with an invasion. 
---
*Players: So pvp in highsec? 
---
*CCP DEV: No we meant they won't shoot NPC rats shooting you.
---
*Players: So when has concord ever come in to shoot anything other then a player...
---
Target swapping like it meant to be. Like sleeper rats bois, not just ordinary nsec, lsec rats.
---
Tower defence is defence using/with towers. National defence is defending your nation. Triglavian defence is defending triglavians. Noone read it wrong, you named it wrong.
---
Pretty sure prime time eu, which would be 10pm eve time.
---
Yes. Please, bring your rorquals to highsec.
---
got almost 2B in a 2-man fleet yesterday. 
---
pretty neat if you ask me. 
---
That does include a book and hugely inflated prices but hey, isk is isk.
---
my personal favorite is "[If you could eliminate a race within the year, which would it be, and why?](https://old.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/bnaceq/if_you_could_eliminate_a_race_within_the_year/)"
---
What about Air defense? Defending attacks from the air?
---

---
Mainly a corpse advertisement, but I was hoping that writing the title like the top posts of all time here would grant this more attention.
---
Now I really need to work on increasing my fake internet points if this is all it takes.
---
Fuck mods what's with the recruitment posts..
---
 /r/evejobs
---
I don't want the k-space bullshit, but it would be nice to at least be able to access the information about it, this not available in wormholes warning should not prevent me from accessing that info
---
They should therefore move it to the list of results, like it may show 'current filter gives no results' it could show 'unavailavle in wormholes' when in wormhole space
---
Not even recruitment bruh, just content if people wanna come pew trigs. Look into it first before getting salty 😤
---
Great, and I thought I was rich when I earned 200 mil in 3 hours.
---
I do think that it is a great idea actually. I will press “down” only when I am not satisfied with game for the particular day... which happens very rare.
---
Hey man, hope you're doing okay. Take things at your own pace and keep your eyes forward, grief is a difficult thing to grapple with but the future will be a better place.
---
Rekt
---
You are blessed, brother!
---
In systems furthest away from the invasion is it possible to run them solo in a Vindi\\T3\\HAC (bring webs) provided you dont fuck up a whole lot and can salvage the loot. Salvage drones seem to work fine with lvl4 skill.
---
What is a Liminal Vedmak?
---
That is a good reminder to use the feature
---
Loot is very uncertain. We got books and datacores even from frigs but it's like less than 1% drop rate.
---
That's the Goatse Game, isn't it?  The only rule of the Goatse Game is: Every time you remember that Goatse is a thing, you lose.
---
I mentioned it at a round table.
---
You should have seen the intrepid pod pilots draw away from that idea :-).
---
It’s a feature of the game. It is part of our nature to explore and exploit every opportunity for a viable revenue stream.
---
Here’s another one I mentioned then: to have an extractor type module that removes valuable head metal from a corpse, if it has any at the time of its demise, and sell those recovered modules on the market.
---
Everything that’s a reality within New Eden should have a natural expression for allowing us to use and create new mechanics, policies, politics and business opportunities.
---
I thought the Captain’s Quarters was a missed opportunity.
---
Imagine a room you can access where you keep the bodies of your victims for display, and then another room where you treasure the bodies of your fallen brethren / sisters in combat.
---
So many ideas, so many opportunities to make EVE come to life in all the myriad ways that is possible.
---
A hallway where you can display screen shots.
---
Corp-customisable uniforms.
---
A cupboard where you see your attire. Your medals, as actual medals on your corp uniform.
---
Your factional warfare rank insignia on your ship, next to the ship’s name on the hull of the ship, like you have the kill marks [another idea I championed with other pilots].
---
Everything that’s not pay-to-win I’m willing to have as a feature that can be bought for some PLEX. We have to understand that EVE Online has to thrive. Why not.
---
So many ideas. Ideas that are in line with what it means to be a pod pilot. Ideas that are internally consistent with the reality of being a pod pilot in New Eden.
---
the bots keep paying the sov bills
---
Are they really dead as you think or just rebuilding?also cant there name go to some scrub.
---
i looted 2 datacores = 139m each, so yes you can make some isk
---
lost 2 merlins trying to even fight one trig ship
---
Nice front page b8 m8 I r8 8/8
---
( °ｏ°) woah
---
Defending from air-based threats, yes.
---
Noctis OP
---
It is the same as Sansha tho.
---
My point. Defending from triglavian based threats.
---
You are asking for people, which is a kind of recruitment
---
TY
---
In case you didn't look at what systems are being invaded, one is lowsec, and I'm sure in the future there will be ones based solely in low or null
---
So CSM was supposed to be in place to represent players, all players. Now you want to gatekeep that behind real identities, which I, for one, refuse to reveal and I highly doubt that is an isolated case. So, in effect, you want to disenfranchise a huge swathe of players just because your opponents in CSM race have a leg up on you. You know, you are not a goon so I wanted to vote for you, but you have now lost that vote.
---
I have terrible standing with Guristas, well in the negatives, but for some reason, this one has been entirely passive. So he's my friend now.
---
Not really recruiting bud. Just a Public content fleet.
---
Op as fuc
---
Specifically, to Yulai.
---
Extracting implants actually doesn't sound that bad.
---
But you know EVE is probably going to go 18+ if you can actually have a corpse storage room.
---
And I agree, CCP missed a lot of chances monetizing the game.
---
Customisable Corp/Alliance uniforms and maybe even ship skins would allow the players to express their artistic abilities more than just sticking to logos and fan art.
---
Heck, just a giant empty lobby in Jita where you can communicate with other people would have increased their sales by 20%.
---
A place where other people can see your rank and kill tally on your ship also sounds really nice.
---
Even better if those were stickers you could place anywhere on your hull, coupled with a bunch of others.
---
You can never underestimate the desire of people to look pretty, and how much money they're willing to spend on it.
---
If it doesn't affect gameplay, like you said, I'd actually welcome it.
---
Make eve dangerous again
---
Happened to me. Launch game and enter just fine after patch. Log out and next time I opened the launcher no accounts so I logged in manually. No account settings saved in game. Log out. Try launcher a half dozen times and then it remember my accounts. Log out and it forgets again. Just had it minimize then I could re-enter the game. If I closed the launcher good chance it didn't have the account info.
---
Stay young!
---
Perfect r/all topic!
---
They also capture what you do. With that you can start to see all kinds of trends.
---
Even a 16k karma post can have the fucking word "hangar" miss-spelled!
---
There are plenty of corps that are recruiting. It mostly comes down to what you want to do. This is a  common question so I'll just paste something from earlier in this thread:
---
&gt; Horde, Karmafleet, and Brave Newbies are all good corps if you are interested in null. EVE University solely focused on teaching, and has activities everywhere but sov null. Signal Cartel is also a good place to go if you enjoy exploration, though they strictly forbid initiating PvP from their side. There are no piratically good groups for FW LS unfortunately, but most corp active in FW will happily show you the ropes if you are interested as a new player, just ask around. WHs are in a similar place, assuming you don't want to join the WH portion of a group like E-Uni of Signal Cartel. 
---
Also, beyond a couple of cosmetic differences, the race you started with doesn't matter after your first couple days in game. Being one race doesn't lock you into or out of anything of significance.
---
They are dead. It was official.
---
`ctrl` + `w`
---
Yeah nah have 2 bugs lodged mate.
---
The updated Agency thingy is alright, I guess. The previous version was slow and laggy as hell. The agent finder still can't do as basic a thing as sorting agents by jump range, which sucks balls.
---
&gt; You can never underestimate the desire of people to look pretty, and how much money they're willing to spend on it.
---
I have been jumping up and down saying this *for fucking years!*. This goes to plain and simple vanity. “Mine is bigger than yours and I’ll show you.”
---
There can only be a limit to what you can do in that space in what you can imagine. It’s supposed to be a universe. It’s supposed to feel real. We can and do things because they are gorgeous. Why are ship skins so wonderful: because they make the boat look pretty. Do we need to spell it out any further? It *looks pretty*.
---
The corpse storage room could be an entirely cerebral affair: a canister with conservation fluid [blue] in which you see the neck and shoulders of the person in a tranquil state of rest. For friends. Our enemies would have a studied look of what could be construed as slight dismay. You don’t see nudity [I don’t care about it but jeebus, think about the children!], you don’t see pained expressions.
---
A box with models of medals won. Also: very much better looking medals in the medal interface. Another one of CCP’s: let’s give them something so they’ll shut up. Could be done so much better.
---
Anything that makes the pod pilot feel that bit more ‘at home’ in New Eden.
---
The overly large demographic in New Eden is adult males. We have some money to spend [not $60 bucks for a monocle, fuck that]. CCP could have made money hand over fist if they had just had the common sense to give the players what they want, as a natural expression of what it means to be a pod pilot.
---
I have been amazed, for years, at how people who are so creative and talented at creating a fantastic game universe, were so hilariously inept at making that into a recurring revenue stream without breaking the fragile, ephemeral fabric of what it means to be a pod pilot.
---
So much potential squandered, the mind boggles at it.
---
Can confirm, if it's more than 10 jumps to jita its not worth it. Super difficult logistics
---
What did they drop from? Battleship only?
---
I like the intro and music selection (a lot! It meshes well), and the first few minutes showcasing the fleet fight, but it's 10 minutes of anchoring and pushing F1-F4. I understand there's only so much you can show in a large fleet fight as a primary (dps) or secondary (logi) ship, but you can work with that by adding in maybe some narrative, background, fleet comms, or something else to spice up the video.
---
From a viewers perspective, it's literally 10 minutes of a dude following broadcasts - not the most exciting or attention grabbing thing.
---
Keep on making videos dude!
---
Maybe it is there for a reason? A ship needs to scan the system before it can lock onto a destination target, so the delay is simulating that within the confines of an old engine.
---
Not defending it, it sounds annoying as fuck, but a possible explanation.
---
It would be fine, but then lets not say "you people elected him", but use the "enough people payed for him".
---
i mean, jump through a bloody hole, have a good read (cloaked off the new hole)
---
jump back when your done. or get an alt,
---
or you know, move out of the wormhole?
---
So many new things to complain about. You must be so happy right now.
---
Incursion rats don't appear on gates in HS only low and null
---
It would be infinitely more fun if the original plan of disabling CONCORD in those systems was a thing.
---
Till then just follow the ninja looters and frag em in instalocking thrashers I guess
---

Hold shift and you can move around the individual probes. Sorry it took me so long to get screenshot
---
I'd pay to have an animated local chat 7o
---
Who did you join?
---
If this is so easy, then in a short time it will worth nothing.
---
Do the triglav ships drop anything?
---
Thank you!!!
---
Stupid thing is, if they truly wanted it for the reasons they claim (to help new players) they could have just limited it to High Sec.
---
Hell do a "Trial deployment" where its limited to High Sec and if they still think newbies are still having issues roll it to Low. If that proves too much roll it back to High Only again.
---
"New Players" barrelling off to live in Null Sec are clearly under some kind of newbie friendly group that should be teaching them what they need to know and keeping them engaged via other means. Or an alt and therefore not a new player at all.
---
It didn't need to be a system wide sweeping change for everyone.
---
I bereave it is based off of a 90 day moving average of the volume traded in all of EVE.
---
In Eve we don't talk about guilds but about corporations. Basically the same thing don't worry. And most corps are interested in new players, it just depends how much you need to be baby sitted or not.
---
I'm unsure about the formula but it's probably the average market price.
---
You don't even need to sacrifice the structure, you can just unanchor it.
---
hahahaha you are a fucking retard.
---
Please get off the internet and do see your carer.
---
I'm a one man alliance now, leave me alone to enjoy my dreams.
---
He joined TRC (lower tier Provi alliance) apparently. There's a character named "Luskarian Chrauthes" who's killboard matches his reddit story.
---
In WWB goons were massively outnumbered (in active players), stayed docked, got burnt to the ground. NCPL spent the majority of the structure bashes shitposting on reddit on their second monitor.
---
Goons then booted all the AFK dead wood and played the NS game perfectly over the last couple of years. PVPers and crabs working together.
---
Now it is NCPLs turn to stay docked, and part of that is taking the shitposts on the chin.
---
You don't eat the corpse.....you make gentle sweet love to it! 
---
Did you envision me eating your corpse this whole time?!? Sicko!
---
I always mentally picture him as being massive. Like about the size of a wale or two.
---
So recruiting for a public fleet, gotya
---
idg poor people. why dont they just buy more money????
---
they can drop from anyone but are rare. I suspect more frequent in BS
---
Hmmm thats a name i havnt seen in a long long time mulic :p
---
Bahaha even better.
---
Damn son you killing it.
---
Although that afk cloaky guy who covers entire regions is annoying af. Creates less content. He should at least make random names and switch them around
---
Do we know each other, Comrade? Or are you another of my alts gone sentient.
---
Invasion Trigs with broken weapon models
---
We are really dead.
---
was kinda hoping for his actual corpse tho, kinda disappointed, smh
---
man those ADC's just dont hold out in armour. &lt;3 logi saved me in this vid like 3 times :D
---
I don't recall the time frame (I think it was before the winter) but basically TEST was being attacked by all the new eastern entities and PL decided to jump on the bandwagon and deploy their super fleet there too. This triggered a response by Goon who deployed North with their armor supers and stayed south with their shield supers to defend home and help TEST. There was a major battle south were titans DDed each other, battle was even but the PL + east side were starting to loose more so they did not reconnected after a server crash. The battlefield was buble camped by TEST for a while but most of the PL + east forces managed to extract their supers in the following days. The battle ended the offensive against TEST and most entities retreated home.
---
In the north tho things were not going great, Gotg and NC were on the loosing side. Goons armor fleet was attacking key keepstars. There were several battles of titans DDed each other, but the keepstar died especially after Goons shield supers and TEST (I think ?) came north. Gotg bent the knee to Goons giving a lot of faction fortizars and a 6 months truce that ended the conflict.
---
I was in your corp a couple years back! Then MBALM in the 0rphanage alliance 
---
Ingame :MrNoodless
---
I was in your corp years back and after that in MBALM in the 0rphanage 
---
MrNoodless
---
I literally got more from it than from the faction drop bonanza this autumn. 
---
Right now, with inflated market, you can make quite a bit, especialyl for hisec.
---
Hey OP! 
---
https://i.imgur.com/rJNGeN7.jpg
---
Know where I can find BRs/articles on the DD exchanges?
---
When does the six month truce end?
---
That you where. Well glad to see you're still playing eve.
---
They do, but they are cleared by HS incursion runners and other mighty players.
---
OK, english is not your first language so you probably didn't understand me properly.
---
A bit more clear: Your piloting is terrible and this is a garbage video. It does not take a counter fit garmur to catch and 'defang' an orthrus. I had to watch Garmonation 5 after seeing this as eyebleach.
---
Sorry to be so upfront but irony is probably not that easy to understand which is understandable.
---
No offence but how is this advanced tackling? You keep it tackled with a snaked garmur and then blob it. It's like any other fight in ever at any given moment. If you had killed it just yourself even then it wouldn't be a great achievement given that you threw 5bil at the problem atleast in 1 ship.
---
wait...titans are 50b now?
---
The 6 months truce is now long gone. Gotg is basically Goon pets now and aren't allied to PanFam anymore.
---
[You should have here the main battle of last year](https://newedenreport.com/2018/12/15/major-battles-of-2018/)
---
Hate train aside, I just don't see the point of these. What kind of conclusions can you get from the question "Did you enjoy playing" with a yes/no feedback?
---
Tbh, if concord was disabled I’d most likely be helping the triglavians lol
---
Try 'view outside' button, you load outside graphic, but still can change ships and move items in your inventory,
---
then when you actually click undock its immediate
---
I always hear this as the goblins from WoW saying it lol
---
this was implenmented to stop a bug with ships being kicked out of citadels with no one in them.....no joke.
---
The only way the name can be reused is if the executor Corp closes the alliance permanently. This is what happened with Band of Brothers, for example. If the alliance just goes inactive, which is what happens 99% of the time, the name cannot be taken from them
---
You can help the Triglav right now by suicide ganking event runners. You can even start your own movement, called "Triglavian Collaboration Force" or some shit, put on them fancy masks, stock Uedama with Catalysts and give the blingy invasion krabs a harder fight than what they bargained for.
---
That's called "emergent gameplay", which is an important part of the sandbox. And if you're successful enough, even the devs will take note, I can assure you.
---
I predict any serious triglavian presence in lowsec will be quickly snuffed out by a few bosons
---
We are glad to be your example of "quality fight" and hope to share that "quality" with you soon again
---
Oh yeah, I remember doing it for a while but I wasn’t sure if it was actually quicker or not. I changed to hangar view since the update since I liked the way it looks.. 
---
I’ll do a little testing when I get on thanks for reminding me about that!
---
nc./pl. or one of their pets will take it over and it will be back on the menu to roam. Goons aren't going to take the sov, they just want to burn it to the ground and then use it as a wildlife preserve.
---
From my understanding, NS all has the same value thus has no value and in that lies the problem.
---
Suicide Banks aren't emergent gaming in my eyes
---
While there is a certain level of skill it basically do I have enough people to kill this before x seconds. Not really what I'm in to at all.
---
Suicide ganks aren't emergent gaming in my eyes
---
I see what you did there.
---
Any decent model maker will know how to paint that in a completely acceptable manner.
---
I have a comment and a question. First I haven't felt very welcomed by the wormhole community. "Not a real wh corp" got flung at me a lot and "oh alright then" being the most positive reaction to not being ready to burn bridges with brave and jump into wh with both feet.
---
And for the question: Why do wormholers shout "delete c4" so much? What's up with C4? On paper it seems like the place to be for sub cap wh connectivity.
---
So... I have to reinstall the game and log in just to let them know I no longer enjoy Eve?
---
just look at all the complains about the UI changes from back in 2011.
---
Pve expansion is a fucking joke. Eve needs more conflict drivers not more pve content
---
&lt;45b if you're in a good alliance
---
What skillbooks?
---
Good old EVE community and inteling someone in moments.
---
Quite probably NC will crawl out from the hole they have hidden and slowly start to rebuild the area.        
---
This will take few months, after this people will put some structures - but will not invest in it (smaller structures, T1 or no rigs ... etc).      
---
This will will setback NC when compared to all groups around the New Eden that will not have to do it.
---
\*Can't technically spin a titan in station.  But that's what alts are for.  Getting lots of kills on my alt in a Harpy.
---
Do you think some smaller groups might try and take slices of it?
---
Nope, not even close to it
---
Well, then, if you don't want to use the tools avaiable to you **right now** to help our Triglavian bros, then, maybe, you don't really want to help them all that much.
---
Besides, there are other ways to do your part, like ninja salavging and suspect baiting.
---
So you have a Harpy alt AND a Titan alt?
---
and the 12 rorqual alts, can't forget those.
---
Or ingame chats.
---
I assume those are all cross trained into useful things?
---
You’ve done well responding twice dude, just ignore him.
---
Found the mobile user!
---
Make sure you take care of yourself OP.
---
NC. will go back to tribute after Goons are done with it, the reason they are there now is because its so close to Jita.
---
there is no way to make it 100% no. But they already do statistics on alt per human, it shouldn't be that hard. 
---
Make it one vote per client, one vote per credit card, or something like that. Sure there are workarounds but most people wouldn't bother and they would be bannable
---
No, after we are going home NC. Can flex it's superfleet on Anny groups that try to take tribute.
---
Classic CCP retard move
---
So brave. This has totally ruined the game and was 10/10 worth a whiney reddit thread.
---
lmao link your killmail
---
What's a "faggot case dismissed"?
---
but do you have 2 harpies
---
Wouldn't bother... hello, skill farms?
---
"only pve ships" Rorqual is one of the strongest drone boats out there.
---
It's certainly not 35000 vs 3000
---
yeah i also heard rumours that china is growing gold crops on fields and one can farm them
---
Cheers for the tutorial.
---
And here I was thinking that I was the master of obsufication.
---
And? 
---
I would not install 200 launchers and have one farm on each just to vote 200 times lol. The amount of extra work is way higher than what you get from it, and credit cards are useless for a skillfarmer
---
Legit question.
---
Did cycle time take the same "hit"?
---
Now make him to contract you everything he has, awox and leave.
---
Your father should have pulled out
---
Your parents should not drop you so many times when you where a kid.
---
This pretty much, i have no problem with this change in theory, just with the scale of it. 
---
If it was only highsec there wouldnt be much issue.
---
And people very obviously do bother
---
Who cares about killboard ..... oh wait wardecers do .....
---
lol, no.
---
just don't go to those systems
---
Can you link your lossmail so I can bake a decorative cake modelled on it.
---
chefbtw
---
you mean THAT book with estimated cost of 500mil and want to buy orders of 134mil?
---
7o 
---
And what are you doing to help ? Right fucking nothing.
---
frontpage bait
---
2 of the industry book, encryption methods and the other invention skill.
---
CCPls send invasion to Jita. The Salt will crystalize the whole system.
---
I think it's actually great as is otherwise we wouldn't get awesome killmails such as this: [https://zkillboard.com/kill/76974778/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76974778/)
---
Not sure if you're willfully ignorant or retarded, if you think people don't operate large quantities of accounts as skill farms.
---
The other book, that goes for 1B and with 650M buys :D
---
Refusing to adapt leads to extinction
---
What? learn to read
---
What is OP even complaining about?
---
Well, apparently a light blaster tornado is a good ship, maybe a rocket nyx would also work
---
Strange name, I would assume that the Triglav Defense would try to support the Triglavs :D
---
I blame OP for the war icon in the upper left of my screen
---
tl:dr Players not being able to travel through HiSec is not a great mechanic for the game.
---
The Agency is not content. It is a tool to find content. All of the things in the Agency are not reachable in WHs, so why do you complain?
---
He probably lost his autopiloting freighter that went through invaded systems and is now crying.
---
I thought you were serious before you mentioned C4
---
Beautiful ! 
---
How dare they make a dangerous game live up to its name. 
---
Welcome to Eve.
---
plz, link 600mil skillbook
---
felt far more frequent than wh swap
---
Obviously this is designed to adress new players. And no matter what they answer, placing this question at the log off button is a pretty good move. It makes people think about this question in the first place. For a new player, that can result in actually understanding what you did and what you might want to do in EVE. Which is a good thing to keep people engaged.
---
lucky, which one tho?
---
For example?
---
He came back &lt;3 https://youtu.be/hX8bFu0UxQw

Can I bring my paitn?

Triglavian Encryption Methods
---
Not every 3 years, but you have a point.
---
I didn't realise we had Krill here...
---
You can, provided you use your brain and pay attention to the even just a little bit. If you put as much as effort as you did to make this braindead post you wouldn't have a problem. What ever happened to HTFU?
---
Just glad they didn't trace my IP yet.
---
One thing I've been wishing a game would incorporate is a shop selling user created content.
---
Not just your average ship skin or cloth texture, but stuff ranging from 3D models of hulls, modules, and and extra limbs to lazer effects and a narration pack replacing Aurora or whatever her name was.
---
I know that mods exist, and that other games let people make and distribute them for free.
---
But hear me out.
---
What you buy would be in the live servers for everyone to see.
---
Of course, there would have to be people to review this stuff as obviously we can't have giant cocks or anime girls floating around new eden.
---
But think of all the possibilities.
---
Creators would have to be paid in plex, not real money, but that would reinforce the idea that creating this stuff is no longer fan-art and the like, rather it's a job that grants you income, officially endorsed by CCP.
---
To be honest, at least it will be harder for them to wiggle out of 90% downvote rates. Maybe it will lead to positive changes? 
---
It's literally the most neutral addition I can think of, you dont even see it until you want to quit. You're free to REEE as much as you want of course.
---
For everyone who didn't discover MP3s, then didn't discover YouTube, and now doesn't know about Spotify, there's Eve Radio.  Eve Radio - it's like when your Uber driver picks the music for you.
---
There are many ways to get away from someone for a time...
---
No most of us dj's play requests from you guys. My show is made up entirely of requests as I'm there to make you have a good time whilst playing so I'll play your requests
---
Are you enjoying EVE? Dude... Shame on you! You dishonoured your space family, you traitor!
---
Sounds like you're the one that broke eve. Ccp catering to mouthbreathers like yourself is what has made this game worse with time.
---
It is a status symbol, like jump fatigue for example. Why are you bothered by it so much?
---
Next time I leave it at 45min :P
---
But I do realise it's not the most engaging type of video. The intent was to have it a bit more documemtary style and not propaganda style. Although I wouldn't mind messing around with that option though. :)
---
Thanks for the feedback though, much appreciated!
---
Why am I feeling so emotionally invested in a belt rat? ;.;
---
My MP3 player does my requests too.  It even gives me Platinum Subscriber Plus status, where only my requests get played for the entire show.
---
Despite all the salt, especially on this sub, more people should know about this!
---
You don't have to tune in but I know where is alot of people in eve that don't even know about us. Plus alot of djs run fleets during shows and do giveaways
---
The key question is who takes the salvage you know Concord dont pay isk for killing trigs....
---
Break EVE? HTFU.
---
Hisec finally stopped to be boring as all fuck, and you call that breaking? 
---
CCP literally fucking told those idiots right on the gate "Hey, here's an invasion here, are you sure your soft tender buttocks are ready?" 
---
I would argue that CCP will get more subs with that thing if they keep the rats camping the gates, give them scrams, and preferrably, establish their sov in Uedama.
---
Yes, in the first couple of days you might expect that a red-ish symbol might be an agression timer. But this is only because it is new.   
---
Also, if you look at it, it is very easy to tell apart from other (important) timers. So just give it a couple of days and it will be fine.
---
... and Incursion Farming 2.0 started officially
---
Yeah I know that's why I thought I would make this post
---
That was my hope for the patch as well. But hey, Uedama is pretty much the only path TO Jita, so it's a next best thing.
---
apparently CCP implemented "safety" button, which leads your autopilot directly into well-known massive invasion of deadly NPC's .
---
&gt;new players with low SP uses weird ships and weird fits
---
what a time to be alive, unbelivable
---
Got my Orca unescorted through the main invasion system just fine last night. 
---
TL;DR is actually - problem has been found between chair and keyboard.
---
Could you be so nice, please, and add it somewhere FUCKING else?
---
If I am so close to the hole, will not any random scanner dude decloak me?
---
It's the greatest and best system in eve.
---
See, long time ago, me and my brother Kyle here, we were  slowboating out way down in lonetrek. When all of a sudden...
---
I am happy that i dont need that stupid thing which is agency... 
---
WHs, the last real sandbox of eve... dont give us questy quests please...
---
In iceland in many many shop / restaurant you have this, it s part of the "culture". So it s not ilogical to find it in an icelandic game.
---
Eventhought it s not clever in eve. :D
---
You dont care about Trigs you dont give damm about the lore either you just want to kill unsuspecting players hanging out in invasion systems and doing their own thing or shoot down who pass by accidently collect lots of kills as result and loot them come on be honest you just want to gank them without beign shot by the Concord...
---
Except for OP said that was the reason he resubbed, he thought he could just free kills in hi sec.
---
Stop whining and go test this shit, its an unreliable piece of crap. It shows one sig everywhere, then you get there, there is zero, or 3, and when you leave the system it goes back to saying it has one...
---
Don't want to spoil you but 95% of kills in eve are ganks where victim don't have any chance of fighting back.
---
When you don't like something, especially if it does not change anything for you this thing exists or not, bitch about it on Reddit so everybody know what kind of frustrated cunt you are. Gj
---
Sad.
---
Isn’t this the point of Eve though, the players dictate what happens. There are pirates in any war zone, so why not in new Eden?
---
The list of things you have no clue about is getting longer every day.
---
I know, but he was wanting it even easier (or less repercussion anyway)
---
That’s super fucking annoying if true. Thanks CCP
---
flash2:wave1: B sale
---
They have upgraded ai. Normal sleepers just keep firing target unless you bring ewar ship,
---
&lt;3
---
I do public fleets now, so you can send people over to learn still when I'm not forming from Dital.
---
Why orthus didnt kill the garmur? Speed of garmur &gt; missile? I have killed some garmur with just a caracal...
---
Yes, mining boosts.
---
To be fair only 2 or 3 fights happened and GOTG has no numbers on these timezones.
---
Ninja salvaging doesn't make you suspect
---
TBH this could be interesting as in lowsec you have just gate guns, yet in those systems you will have faction militia ... but CCP decided to go the "boring way" instead of creating something different.
---
Help them now before its too late, they will be the new concord when this is over
---
All Null sec alliances that could challenge NC. have sov all ready, no one is willing to go long term and fight nc. for the sov. Not even goons will challenge NC. for the sov. Goons will take it now then as soon as they undeploy NC. will take it back.
---
If goons really wanted to take it from NC. they would have to put in place an imperium alliance to hold sov with a member count to defend that sov. Not sure what alliance would want to sandwich between Dead &amp; co and pamfam, out of jump range from the rest of Imperium.
---
Impossible!
---
Deadco is Imperium these days
---
The people who have replied with experience in the customer service/satisfaction fields explain more, but CCP would be able to look at lots of data, potentially "what did this person do during play".
---
if you use this screen to quit the game you opinion is irrelevant
---
air defense defends air space.
---
Only difference I've spotted is the undock button. I spend most of my time undocked.
---
What would be interesting is if Concord was only disabled for Precursor hulls, so to attack players in the invasion systems you had to be flying a Triglavian ship.
---
But by blowing up your own struct you make it a strong point that you don't care about the kb like they do, before they'll cry.
---
you need a fleet that kills everything, just make surre to loot first
---
Holy balls this is incredible! Do want! :D
---
Given the triglav love ritual combat and even have proving grounds for capsuleers to fight them and each other in...
---
I think the triglav want to fight
---
The entire point is to close the hole before anyone could jump it, or to roll out someone who *was* in the hole. When you see someone landing you’d jump and close the hole.
---
So you can ruin *whoever* killboard just like that? Congrats CCP
---
Gotta wonder if it's worth it these days with all the botting, UI changes, staleness in null, etc.
---
Yeah so if you want it documentary style then tell a story. Assume your viewer knows very little to anything about the nullsec meta; explain why you are there, what's going on, what's at stakes (if anything), and so on. That can take as little as 45 seconds or as long as 2 minutes but it builds up some viewer investment into the video, especially if you're trying to push 8+ minutes of content.
---
At least we know he can count to two
---
they didnt even use it for this. all i saw where moveops.
---
and even therefor its been kind a years :)
---
the only thing i saw getting dunked was a goon baltec fleet in 15w :D
---
OPSEC
---
Fleet chatter is sometimes a bit delicate, given the notoriously paranoid eve meta. Next thing I need to find out is how to adapt musiclevels when I want to talk over it, but that should be doable.
---
I also need to see if I can record in a format that supports more than two channels so I can keep game/coms/my mike separate, and that also doesn't become unusable in case OBS doesn't finish the file properly. Next time :)
---
Agency window.
---
+ Forcing escalations through that pile of crap instead of journal
---
That man is a true entrepreneur.
---
Let's hope it won't be in a pulsar :p
---
Wow, you are almost reaching my levels of edginess. 
---
Which, for every "normal" person up there should be a fucking reddest flag ever. :D
---
I had jump cloned to an empty pod to my old home where I still had solo ships over in the minmatar facwar area. I normally would run MG/HG in lowsec.
---
Would be horrifically OP, just ganking freighters all day.
---
LOL that BR shows one NC. Intipilot... was the only dude NC. had left which found the undock button good fucking job. Keep getting hard over it :)
---
It's funny how you goons keep chest beating. Fact is all you have are numbers. NC. undocks when they can get a fair fight, there sense of fair is around outnumbered 2:1. Nearly every time these fair fights happen goons and friends bite the dust and get whelped. You might have numbers but you lack skill. NC. is better in PvP then Goons, For now.
---
congratulations :) go get some crazy pvp caps you'd dont use anyway :)
---
i wish i didn't have to complain about ccp incompetence
---
Join fleet. Make friend with logi pilot (at least one) and make sure he knows what he is doing. Broadcast for reps. Profit!
---
 
---
## Members [34140] GSF VS  [3858] NC. diffrence = 30282 
---
Stats here as Dotlanresults from just now
---
truesec still matters, npc loot matters, geography / jump ranges matter
---
but moons don't matter anymore and they were the biggest imbalance between regions. now there are far more moons in the game than people to mine them, and the guys that based their entire setup on old-school moon mining didn't adapt.
---
Good video, thank you!
---
Tell them that yourself. I see no benefit from you telling this to /u/Asks_For_Sources
---
People have been doing this for a long time now. CCP doesn't care because lol people who care about kb stats.
---
D E L E T C4 is mosty a meme from C5 Dudes
---
One of the reasons is that a c4 group can "cap blop" another entity in their hole while the attachers cannot escalate back, and if you have a 3b hole( usually  h900 from C4 to C5 space) it takes 5 BS to one shot it while in C5 you just need one carrier back &amp; forth to roll it
---
If you wish you assist the Triglav then ensure that any Triglav ships destroyed by terrorist capsuleers have their contents seized before the capsuleers have a chance to loot it. I myself have taken on this responsibility and shall be returning the contents to Triglav at the earliest convenience.
---
Yes, via ninja salvaging and stealing loot. Or more fun: killing other players and looting their wrecks, made yesterday about 800mil from shooting criminals.
---
Not that EVE players ever cared about light in the first place
---
Yet less OP than the original plan to just completely disable Concord in invasion systems all together
---
This isnt new. People have been doing this pretty much since the ability to deliver inside a citadel was added.
---
then..what is it oh wise one? I was speaking in terms of a toon to toon, goon to nc only basis. don't get into the "oh not all goons are in the war they are all miners wahhhhhh" bs. I mean if you want me to quote the actual numbers from dotlan as to goonswarm only versus ncdot only then I can do that, but since you want to sperg out nonsense and I am speaking relatively and situationally, please go ahead with your narrative, smartass. 
---
btw, the actual number from dotlan is 34140 to 3858, so pbbbbt
---
are you gandhi?
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
Is it really? Ok? I find it more a lazy implementation with no regard to effort/reward. It's basically grinding NPC's for some random neutral that steals all rewards.
---
Make the systems 0.0 or suspect flag the ninja salvagers.
---
That would be worse! One of the effected systems yesterday was Uedama, could you imagine the carnage
---
Yeah mostly only the defensive geography/jump ranges matters on an alliance level, and less so than before thanks to jump bridges. There’s good sec in most null regions save for the obvious dog shit ones (looking at you cloud ring)
---
It would be glorious
---
While I see your point, you've chosen to limit yourself to only wormholes. And there's nothing stopping you from daytripping and doing the new triglavian invasion. Or creating an alpha and ninjalooting.
---
You do not in any way, shape, or form own salvage.
---
trade sov to Dead &amp; Co for another 50 faction forts.
---
Treat people in your debt like family... exploit them.
---
u/RonUSMC
---
Can we have the "takes 10s" removed from the thread post? 
---
Those were clearly server-side and anyone chosing reddit to answer the question "shouldz I haz 64 bit selectedz?" gets an inaccurate first impression.
---
I'm sure a loot pinata Low Power fort in that system had absolutely nothing to do with the decision to siege it.......
---
Found an answer for #3
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
"an agent in 0.5 security system pays 80% more than an agent in 1.00 security system"
---
1. Choosing a system isn't as straightforward and depends on your risk tolerance (popular 0.5 system has more risk of ganks compared to less populated 0.8), availability of desired level agents and corp LP value.
---
2. There isn't "best" per say. Some might fanboy about SOE LP, I would say Thukker LP is awesome, some would make a killing on BPCs with RnD corps' LP. Find your niche using an LP search, map and common sense. Check the services providing LP value calculations and keep in mind that lower security agents pay a bit more.  Here are some services you can use: [http://lpstock.ru/](http://lpstock.ru/) ; [https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/lpstore/](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/lpstore/) ; [https://www.eve-mogul.com/lpstore#/list](https://www.eve-mogul.com/lpstore#/list)
---
3. Yes, exactly that way
---
Id love to glass hisec with them
---
If concord so great why don't they fight trigs themselves?  Why have capsuleres do it?
---
“Largest real corp” because the actual largest corp only has 3 active pilots this week for 308 toons ???
---
Issues with FEDUP:
---
-overemphasis on Nullsec fleet attendance causing a “de facto ban on other content” 
---
-lying about importance of legacy fleets so Alliance looks better (calling stratops CTAs)
---
-alleged toxic members not being addressed properly
---
/u/CaseyLP where is your karma whoring article?
---
I have a pile building up and I'm not really sure what to do with them, any suggestions?
---
just use a pulse oracle, ez clap
---
I care about my kb. It is like an eve diary, just sad that my newbie days aren't on it.
---
But its a 5% increase that everyone can have pay or not, "pay to win" indicates that you get a advantage otherwise unattainable.
---
You can argue that omega status is pay to win, but not injectors thats just silly.
---
I did, repeatedly, while RW was on sisi.
---
Thank you mate. Do you know what the grind is like to get to L4 from L2 missions? I'm hoping it's something I can do within a week
---
You can split the audio from the video in a video editor like Wondershare Filmora, and adjust audio levels to match video levels. It supports multiple audio channels too, so you can have a very low volume of music still playing while having comms chatter over it (so as to not fuck with the pacing).
---
As for OPSEC stuff, there's nothing opsec about an FC calling for an align when its happening, or calling a target that's already broadcast and selected in your HUD. You don't have to include anything you aren't comfortable with but it adds more when you have a confident-sounding FC taking charge of a grid or having a clean and organized extract when leaving a losing grid. Fleet comms/bullshitting is also fun to add in if you're just waiting on a titan and you want to add in some fleet size effect.
---
Just food for thought. I love seeing well-made videos, and I hate seeing sped up F1 mashing and blue dots shooting red or orange dots, all to poorly synced techno music and low-res dabbing skeletons.
---
Wait so H900 C5&gt;C5 admits caps and H900 C4&gt;C5 doesn't?
---
&gt; it's a job that grants you income, officially endorsed by CCP.
---
I like the idea. I fully support it.
---
It’s never going to happen.
---
When CCP does this, they now have to contend with -every-law-everywhere- that pertains to the creation of items, the ownership of items, legal liability, insurance, intellectual property rights, and the no doubt slew of other legal implications I’m now not even aware of that exist.
---
Everywhere where they are active. Everywhere people can access New Eden from. Plus the relentless abuse that players and botters alike are going to subject CCP to to scam people, to short-change people, to steal from people.
---
Then there are the money implications that will come into play.
---
The legal ramifications, barring a globally recognised legal framework that would govern all these challenges, which today does not exist and it won’t exist for a very long time to come because of the humongous complexity of the issues involved, are too hard to overcome by one games studio.
---
I fully support the idea, and I think for limited-range items something could be arranged. But a totally free market system in which people trade from every corner of the globe, the day CCP implements that is the day they hire a legal team that is 10 times larger than the amount of developers they employ today.
---
It’s just never going to happen.
---
how does this post have 5 upvotes...only krabs left in this crap game?
---
I would expect most of the "funzie stuffz" resulting from CCP_Round() is done server side. 
---
So, yes. And possibly more.
---
Nice Job
---
Good feedback.
---
While you are kind of right, would you like some whine with your cheese? Really, there's no need to be so.... douchy about it. Yes, CCP could have iterated on stuff that they've already done that isn't quite so awesome or they can add new stuff until they get something right, catch a breather and then iterate without losing a load of the player base over it. Either enjoy the game or simply win and move on. No point being a GOM about it.
---
You should definitely be able to do it in a week but it will bore you to tears.
---
  
---
If you are newish to the game just make sure you are able to fly a decent ship that can handle l4s if you e only done l2s so far
---
Exactly,
---
No cap can through a hole that has at least one c4 or lower class hole on one side 
---
So if you want one you have to build it locally
---
Does it have one? The login screen Song Has Not been changed for ages... So sad...
---
I'd be zooming around in a Kiki if being in trig ships in invasion areas made you an enemy to capsuleers
---
I would advise missioning for Caldary Navy, because:
---
1. Ichoriya system has two lvl 4 agents in same station.
---
2. Ichoriya is a 0.6 security.
---
3. Most important, Jita 44 station is Caldary Navy ... so u will benefit from some tax reduction when u sell/buy there.
---
You know, if you don't mourn about every little shit, your legit complains can be taken more serious.
---
&gt; So if you want one you have to build it locally
---
I knew this part, i just didn't know that the class was the restrictor i thought it was the hole type that determined the size (i've heard you can get hics through frig holes with some jiggery pokery which led me to thinking this.)
---
Been playing for about 2 years, just left my corp so I'm back in hisec deciding what I plan on doing next. Thought id try some mission running in the meantime. Think ill pick up a machriel for L4's, seems to be highly recommended
---
I wasn't in AIDER long, but they were really cool guys.
---
Duh. Why wouldn’t someone want to do that?
---
o7 see ya guys somewhere else. Have a blast in FW spice shit up.
---
Bit of an expensive way to get your kb green lol.
---
Perfect, cheers pal
---
It is not about free kills, it is about PvP zone. Players would enter it with understanding that it is PvP zone. It would an PvP zone in PvP oriented game. wow, how new this concept is.
---
On a 4K gaming laptop the Enable High DPI and UI scaling doesn’t appear to be functional
---
it's a gm who forgot to cloak.
---
you are being investigated.
---
Selling Tribute permits. Only 10m / year!
---
Only one ☝️ is who’s coming to fight is pandemic horde. Your alliance died when space aids were introduced. Go back to your corner and stay dead, PL is irrelevant in Eve.
---
it doesn't, i got baited into logging in by the op
---
Somebody called us? :D
---
This, but unironically.
---
That would be dope as well, if you were in a trig ships and you couldn’t attack or be attacked by triglavians yet you could repair them and vice versa. Now that would be some good content haha
---
One of the three characteristics of holes is the maximum mass that can go through
---
C5/C6 allows 1.25Bt mass so everything but titans &amp; supercap
---
C4-C2 allows 300t so everything but capital (except orca)
---
C1 allows 20t so everything  but battleship and above 
---
Freg size only allows frigate &amp; destroyer and HICS with at least one (or two) zero point mass entrangler which is module that drastically reduced their masses
---
Ah yeah you'll be sound then shield machs smash most missions. Good combo of dps, range, plus the warp speed bonus is awesome
---
I think there's a workaround. Check [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bub1oj/postpatch_launcher_issue/) thread.
---
I missed that but C5&gt;C5 are H296 not H900 :)
---
To you "injectors is pay to win" people, it is not, "pay to win" indicates that you gain a advantage that is otherwise unattainable, basically omega status is pay to win, injectors is not!
---
Just steal their loot, they all agress. Que your friends warping in
---
I ran some abyssals yesterday and had no issues with drones dying.
---
You should probably just relog, in the past I had T2 heavy fighters get 1 shotted by a battleship rat on a maxed out super pilot. 
---
There seems to be some intermittent glitch where your drones/ fighters don't get their HP.. at least from what I experienced.
---
👀
---
If you don't realise there is a lot more on the Settings screen than the  "Log off" button is your opinion relevant?
---
Lol your efforts to defend your ability to vote with SP farmer accounts and buy votes is pathetic
---
there is , but wow classic is coming out only in August (maybe)
---
We've not even got to the proper sites spawning yet, let alone the World Ark. Give it a chance.
---
Nothing wrong with danger I hunt other explorers and get hunted.  Its part of the fun.  Its just to easy to track explorers now.
---
I belive the plural of Harpy is Herpes...
---
Wait, no. Shit. Got to go have a serious talk with the gf.
---
But that means that a P060 wormhole to C1 space should admit a Nestor battleship even tho its only supposed to be battlecruiser doesn't it? Also orca is only 150t and i've seen orcas come into the C4 i live in. Or were you referring to the orca as a capital?
---
Sorry if i'm being obnoxious, i'm trying to make sure i have my head wrapped firmly around all this.
---
After ALWAR had a similar split a month or so ago (People in the corp left to make a new one to do FW) this isn't really surprising.
---
Getting my bingo card ready
---
You get pissed about lost logins, I get pissed about EVE changing its volume.
---
His mum took his laptop \*and\* it was past his bedtime...
---
Meanwhile FEDUP leadership are wondering where they left their reverse card...
---
To be fair, it does seem like a legal nightmare if you put it that way.
---
Having to deal with the laws of every single country that has eve players? Heck no.
---
Still, I was talking about job as in an in-game job, like an explorer or ratter.
---
Even though you'll probably need plex to buy and sell those things, it's still classified as in-game money and CCP still would ban real life transactions.
---
Therefore granting you Plex/ISK as income in exchange for your services, like any other activity in the game.
---
Sorry if that wasn't clear enough.
---
Plus, making it so that you could earn real money off of this could actually be awesome if implement ed.
---
Maybe have a contest to see who makes the best stuff, and hire them in the position of a "Creator", then CCP can pay them a percentage of what their creations made.
---
Yep, you're correct the plateless nestors is exactly 20t so it can go through C1 :)
---
It's the only BS that can (lorewise, is that SOE tried to make it warp cloak but they fucked up and the mass has been greatly reduced)
---
And iirc orca are classified as capital industrial ship :)
---
And np :)
---
Shoot every wreck
---
Now now nobody gets to profit from our fallen Triglav heroes.
---
That makes a lot more sense. Haha. I was trying to figure out how to make a cube with the spheres.
---
I never understood why FEDUP went to legacy anyway. Their niche was always FW and they seemed to do well in it.
---
You checked task manager to see if the 1st launcher fully closed?
---
Not putting invasions on SiSi for player testing was a really smart move that has paid off in spades.
---
You guys happened to fight us the day I wrote the article- but it was a fun fight!
---
Do it!
---
who needs testing anyways. xD
---
It took me about 10 minutes to re-add all my accounts.
---
Pay to win.. faster
---
Just like when you have good standings for diamond rats right?
---
That's just you
---
Poor CCP Mimic and her voice
---
I think i noticed that EVE is listed on steam as early access game, so lack of testing is kind of normal.
---
Oh yeah, I forgot that was a thing.. Now that you mentioned it, I don’t think it would be that hard to implement since it’s an already existing mechanic.
---
You can gain good standings with the triglavians but you lose standings with all other factions haha
---
**Let's say I have a star base I've been working on for months. A pirate corporation wants some action and declares war against me one day. Night passes and I have log off.** 
---
I recommend that before you even place down a structure:
---
\- Define its purpose and all the factors that can change affecting that purpose
---
\- Plan and prep security plan for the structure: internal access / functions AND the contingencies of what to do if attacked. reinforced, or just extorted.
---
\- Determine your in-game finances to support the above two points.
---
\- Determine your IRL ability to support those two points
---
I personally have figured that without a corporation with capable players who provide redundancy, it's always a matter of when, not if, I will encounter high sec war deccers or market changes that challenges my purpose.
---
Shit man, people paid 500 Mil isk for a low tier guy's corpse (myself). I'm sure if you find someone that has a strong disliking, they'll offer you isk for the corpse.
---
Correct
---
The guy that tried to catch me last night said it was instant for him.  I thought it was interesting that the guy doing the hunting was using terms like op and lame when talking about how easy it was to find me using the Agency window.
---
I just had this happen this morning. My settings were set to use the Beta launcher, reverted to Release and all the accounts appeared again without having to do anything else. Many thank to the corpmate that clued me in on this, saved me probably two hours or more of answering emails for verification codes and setting up all my groups and then readding all the reminder text for each account.
---
incursion ninja looting more like.
---
I heard Tapi paid BBC to harass them up in cloud ring whilst Tapi diplos repeatedly asked them to join. Unconfirmed but something I can see happening.
---
It's OK, it's just that it is badly placed: you are being asked a question about having played today on the LOGIN screen.
---
Obviously, unless you're re-logging, you haven't played today yet. I don't see anyone hitting "log off" then go back to the character screen just to answer the question. It makes no sense.
---
Yes. Death to all Triglavian hostiles. Let's help them! Much more fun than pve.
---
Why other factions if you're just killing capsuleers? Just sec status
---
Same, the stuck process was like this 
---
evelauncher.exe -update -update -update -update -update
---
That was never the plan. CCP fucked up its wording. They meant to say that CONCORD wont respond to trigs shooting yoy
---
That sounds ridiculous but who knows lol.
---
How comes Concord would punish my gank while they don't attack the triglavian ships?
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA
---
A litteral neckbeard?
---
I do believe it could spark a renaissance for the capsuleer’s chances to impact the environment in more ways than simply partaking.
---
It would be essential that their shit can get blown up. There can be no EVE without risk, I would not agree with that.
---
But, there’s so many things that can be done, it would be interesting what is possible in that space.
---
I’d apply for a position like that of sorts, but I’m going to be a few qualifications short of a useful resume.
---
Keep thinking along those lines, maybe you’ll find a working solutions. I’ll be happy to support it.
---
I mean I just thought of it this way, if you’re basically taking on the triglavian’s side and they’re pretty much invading new eden, it kinda makes sense? It’s just a fun thought tbh
---
I think this is punishment for the tongue flicking GIF.
---
Turns out the NPCs are still floating around so maybe the invasions are still active, but the affected systems have lost their abyssal background and funky triglavian text: https://i.gyazo.com/2f959d380afbe503b54356212b305233.jpg

Mad and salty, my 2 favorite tears flavors.
---
Look, it's the new Drifters.
---
"No reason to back to Gal FW. SNUFF and WANGS are evil and content killers"
---
Thats where it is
---
Good. LS need more content and more newbie friendly corps.
---
because its a video game probably
---
Never quite understood why a FW corp would go be pseudo-renters in nullsec.
---
Tribute's only real value is being in direct jump range of Jita. This is good if you're not interested in building an empire, but still interested in personal industry. Being so close to Jita let you, as an individual, do a moderate amount of industry stuff effectively. Obviously, sourcing materials from Jita can't generate the kind of titan numbers that the Imperium has -- Jita just doesn't have enough stuff for that. (We've taken steps to ensure this, after all.) Very likely, Tribute was chosen by NCdot off of the back of maybe a dozen or less folks in a good ol' boys club who wanted to have industry structures close to Jita.
---
Yeah but you only lose standings in EVE for attacking players in lowsec in faction warfare corps.
---
Use a Glamourex-50 booster and the grind is pretty low if you want just one corp. maybe 5-8 hours of active gameplay, so a couple of evenings.
---
im not mad or salty, im literally just reposting what was said in the link for people who can't be asked
---
But I mean you have to gain good standings for the triglavians right? That’s what I initially said, you might have to do missions for them or certain things that should obviously lower your other standings while gaining standings with the triglavians..
---
...is there even anymore fun left in this iteration of eve?...not for me at least
---
Oh man, it hurts.
---
yeah aider are nice guys, XMETA is a bit trashy imo
---
lol no you're not
---
Isk sent, go get some pvp.
---
Oh look, redalert is here to spread his idiocy.
---
If it's shit, it's shit. If ccp don't want to be called out for making half assed content and never iterating on it... maybe they should iterate on things so they aren't shit.
---
I'm not here to suck ccp's dick, especially when they've done very little to deserve it.
---
Yea I didn’t click with most the other corps in fedup tbh, maybe just of my short time tho. I think Xre is/was in xmeta? He was cool.
---
The only way to win EVE is to not play.
---
i literally just paraphrased it, you're a fucking idiot mate
---
You're paraphrasing it with more salt than in the dead sea.
---
Touched on most of the things I like about living in whs. Community, small fleet sizes, and meaningful intel are some of my biggest factors. Most groups are interested in fighting and they're friendly about it. The best way to make friends is to start shooting at people. 
---
It's such a contrast to roaming null. I understand why people don't want to fight in their ratting VNIs. I know they aren't required to come fight our 3 man gang. The question is why wouldn't you want to? What are you playing for if you'd rather spend the next 10 minutes docked so you can go back to semi afk farming isk instead of undocking combat ships to engage with other players? It isn't a rhetorical question. It seems like missing out on a lot of fun and I don't really understand.
---
wtf I'm upvoting an Olmeca post?
---
Because FEDUP isn't an alliance, it's a vehicle for a group of people to call themselves important.
---
Even when we were in null we usually baited fights with our passive shield VNIs (with scythes on standby). They have a great ship for PvP, but they just don't want to PvP!
---
i was in your shoes when i was young. sadly there are "adults" that behave the way you describe and it makes me angry. i always scold other "adults" when they discriminate younger people.
---
keep your head up and speak up :) i went from being really really bad at english (almost failed class) to having A's and B's and speaking fluently. all thanks to eve
---
There are plenty of green sites you can warp to without scanning them... You'll die in a fire if you don't knoww what you are doing since they are **much** harder than K-Space...
---
And your problem with this is...?
---
Stupid PvE: When you stream yourself ratting without delay ...
---
Confirmed.
---
Mercenary Coalition joined PL to help us rebuild our image and to teach us how to adapt to the ever changing Eve.
---
Yeah the campers create no content at all. They are so useless.
---
Oh oh!
---
For the next one, do a multaplasmid gambling one, my corps exec needs it fast before our wallets empty!
---
AFAIK yes, /r/eve is being filterd from /r/all due to the massive baitpost barrage we had.
---
Assuming not bait, WH space is a little like null with no concord protection at all, though there's no official sovereignty and you only appear in local if you actually send a message. It has some of the best ISK in the game (outstripping Super/Titan ratting at the top end) but due to wormholes despawning and respawning every day (or every time you shove a ton of mass through them) it's a much more dynamic space than actual nullsec. Caps are also much rarer in PVP - standard armor brawls rarely have more than 1-2 even in C5 space and in C4 space the attacks can't bring any at all!
---
Invasion fought off, we won
---
It's not about making my killboard green, but making yours red
---
New Incursions being broken?
---
We've definitely never seen this before.
---
Moons
---
That's true, we can't have risk without ISK, or the other way around.
---
Maybe have the files materialize into an item similar to a blueprint, and have it so that the BPOs can be stolen or looted?
---
You shouldn't be able to have two exact same original blueprints at once, meaning it should take some time to redesign a model and get it approved.
---
Also, have the processing plant only able to work in null/wh, and make it really easy to blow up.
---
This making it so that a plant with the BPO and bunch of finished products could be worth quite a few ISK, and the transports on their way to Jita be real tasty lookin.
---
The creator would have to hire security or get aid from his corp mates.
---
Plus this would mean the products would be exchanged for ISK at a market, unlike the Plex method that I suggested that was similar to the new eden store we have now.
---
We could have an advertizement page, but this way we'll have way more risk involved.
---
Held off and killed a mid sized fleet of the smaller ships in a Tengu yesterday. However once they had triple webs and dropped multiple larger ships on grid I started breaking. Luckily the "anchoring" ones that scram you are fairly rare... for now.
---
Keep in mind this is a level 1 of 3 invasion scale so expect levels 2 and 3 to be non solo able. Maybe with an extremely kitey setup, but then you won't be getting loot/salvage.
---
Why would you want moons over FW l4s?
---
Real men test in production
---
I seriously need to finish reading that solo frigate pvp guide.
---
I'll be looking for roams in the meanwhile, thanks for the donation.

Are you still on W7?
---
If you want to play wow classic you just go to some private shard running old version of WOW.
---
True, but catching botters is a whole different story than normal Carebears without bots
---
Nothing would have changed even if it was up for testing tbh
---
i mean the bit i paraphrased wasn't salty, the jab at casey maybe but idk what you're on about
---
Imagine making a new account because everyone knew the man behind the old one was a retard

I did held pretty well in a Vaga but lack of tackle made the reinforcements overwhelm me pretty quickly, frigs are very hard to track.  
---
In a Vindi, as soon as anything gets the web, it pops in couple of volleys, provided the BC and BS don't appear.
---
Absolutely need dual-rep, and an Improved Exile booster (or some deadspace mods, I was used cheap rolled T2 reps and Navy EANM) It was also powered by 3200 boosters so you need to be quick abount popping them.
---
At least that was by experiece about it, running a low-rank unpopulated system (10-15 in local). Given that all the loot was mine or my corpies', it was totally worth it even considering Vindi purchase.
---
I am Billy.
---
PVP focused corp is fed up with sov null, what a surprise
---
Well, turns out we beat the invasion back! Good job everyone!
---
Interesting theory.
---
I play windowed and was able to set mine to 110.
---
At first it defaulted to 150.
---
Not even. You need to know what to do with the damn skills you buy.
---

---
That's it? I was hoping for gate deactivation, a massive armada, etc... how underwhelming.
---
It should be pointed out the the content while easier is more engaging than sitting in a 40 man fleet and grinding HQ site after HQ site in an incursion.
---
The new combat AI has more interesting interactions than the older sansha AI.
---
I enjoy the roaming fleet conditions and am already thinking of how I can use this to train myself as a skirmish FC and help train new players in small-mid fleet combat without 100% dropping them into the deep end

simply gank everyone fighting them while they are Fighting them. repeat as amny times as necessary

All I found was an old reddit post [old reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3jw6gy/sov_indices/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) about it.
---
After DT you should get all of the new sites added to the old ones that you used to have. Here’s the security bands and upgrades [for your reference.](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/210777969-Sovereignty-System-Upgrades)
---
Lol... few years ago i remember some guyz cloaking their titan in some random system, and streaming it's possible position... this stream got huge spike in views... many people fast travelled into the system, and got killed in gate camps. Then, after while, people  noticed the titan was cloaked in test server, but they somehow changed the local (cant remember), and mate it as the tranquility one. sorry cant fully remember.... I cant forget these guyz, they were drinking, having fun, and one of them said: oh mannn... titans are best bait evah (or something like that)......... i just got some idea... what if you made similiar bait, like ratting carrier without cyno and very bad fit on the test server, and waited with some nice pvp carrier fit with some cloaked friends on the live server.... ahh shit
---
...i had a deja-vu while reading this...
---
Unfortunately yes, I’m so ready to be disappointed again
---
This is EVE Online. CCP knows that if we enjoy the game every time we play we get bored and quit. They are trying to make sure we hit the thumbs down button at least once per week.
---
no, it's correct, basically the same to what i've said.. but with more words and pictures :)
---
Having offlined mod in the slot is the same as having empty slot.
---
I always feel like they revamp the same shit over and over, the drone UI and fleet UI have been the same for the last like 10 years....
---
FW level 5s are where it's at.
---
Gimmi m'y bhaal back... :p

FW was dead in US tz and members complained about no content, tbh. constantly.

EVE Radio has gone through difficult times in the past (management changes, server host changes, lack of DJs, lack of funding) but it still remains a great service.
---
i have very sad experience with UO private servers , i won't do that mistake again
---
&gt; TLDR: How to find and share fun in EVE?              
---
We post on reddit.           
---
TBH game have old players loving it as before the big push for monetization  (aka extractor/injector) a lot of bad changes (rorquals, citadels,thera) it was actually very fun game to play.           
---
People hope it will go to the roots someday.
---
Like it is only a game, who cares if it will shut down at some point.
---
All great ideas.
---
For me it has to be possible to implement that in some way in the game. I like the risk involved. It should be dramatic. I don’t mind that the payout is huge, but the risk should be proportional.
---
Great thinking!
---
Sunk cost fallacy.
---
if you asked me to pick a game to start playing it wouldn't be eve.
---
However after accumulating assets for nearly a year, eve has more appeal than starting fresh in a new game.
---
That escalated quickly.
---
Eve radio needs more interviews, podcasts, news, stuff regarding Eve and not only random music you can listen on any radio.  
---
Back in 2013 we had some podcasts done by dj's, like BigCountry, FunkyBacon, etc.
---
There are skills which boost your standings.
---
Can't remember all, or what they do exactly, but I do remember one called "Connections" which gives a good boost.
---
Any tips on what damage type works best and what res to stack? I only have 1 friend I play with whos half mining half combat skilled and were both 1 year in. Im 100% combat skilled so Im hoping we can pull something off. Doesnt sound like it but it will be fun to try regardless. Im covering all his losses anyway XD. Thanks for the feedback everyone.
---
PvE is dull enough as it is. Without decent stream interaction why bother
---
&gt;  just advance you forward in time

Depending on what size they are, if you want to donate them to a good cause, you could tube them and ship them over to our office and we could auction them at the Fanfest 2020 Silent Auction in support of Barnaspítali Hringsins :)
---
Would be happy to reimburse you the shipping costs in PLEX, no worries!
---
What other decent mmo’s are out there?
---
Get into LS, get into T1 ships, look for fights. You will get them. I can reliably get 1v1 in frigates, and as a small gang you can easily get fights or bait people into fights. You just have to operate in the right area.
---
This isn't a game, its a hobby much similar to having a train set in your mom's basement, and the only other people who "get it" are your friends who have train sets in their mom's basement too!

Well they are regrouping from what we know.          
---
Sansha Nation is still to introduce True Collective to the Triglavians that we brought back.               
---
Space behaves differently in there and we need bit time to adapt to this.
---
Just to add a few ideas I thought of quickly, CCP could incorporate all the approved designs at the weekly DT, and have the design tool download be selectable for non-designers to not waste their storage.
---
A new path of industry could really freshen things up, not to mention the inevitable Star Wars and Star Trek ships we'll see, along with the anime girl narration.
---
fanboys care , i guess. For me it's just one more option or one less option , same as eve . just an option

There's a big difference between skillpoints and playing skill. You still need to put in those hours learning not to get rekt or those T2 guns aren't going to do you a damned bit of good.

Switch launcher branches, from beta to stable or vice versa.

So they get limited aggression timer with the suspect. What are you friends supposed to do now?
---
Interviews is something I'm going to be working on as I'm new back to the station after having a few years away. I previously did interviews with some of the devs. I also try keep the convo as much towards any new eve stuff too.
---
you haven’t even logged in, in like a year? how do you even have a clue as to what to give an opinion about?
---
I'm a fellow new player who tried to get my friends into it too. I did hisec lv4 missions for 2 months to build an ISK account. All my friends quit in that time. Now I joined a WH group to try something new. I never wanted to do the nullsec bullshit because I'm not interested in being someone else's pawn. In WH space, there's so few people and no rules so you can pretty much do whatever you want, all with lucrative rewards for the small cost of lots of time spent invisible scanning.
---
Isn't that criminal offense?
---
Might as well go for their ships at that point.
---
I think streamers with delay aren't fun to watch. Might as well watch a Youtube video at that point. 
---
I'd say the most popular Eve streamers are (or were) Zarvox and Bjorn and neither had a significant delay.
---
My english improved a lot after I started talking on comms. I recommend you try and if people don't understand you, ask for tips from them about what they didn't understand and how it's pronounced correctly.
---
Don't be afraid of asking for help, no one was born knowing it all.
---
Hmm I smell faint fake newbie  aroma in the air.
---
Yeah, the null can be pretty boring in a big group that really, has no choice but to never trust anyone. I first left null for WH life, a bit more random and with people putting more trust in you (typically, simply because of the smaller size)
---
For me EVE is about overcoming challenges and inventing creative ways to overcome hurdles or do content poeple thought was undoable without a huge investment. And running a small corp focused on NOT doing the political bullshit. 
---
To that end,  I love the co-op abyssals, small exploration fleets for WH daytripping and rare nomadic expeditions into WH space with my corpies. The new abyssla invasion yesterday was pretty fun too. We had a newbro learn the basics of combat scanning and drop us onto the trig fleets, was hella fun. If you wanna try those things, you'd be welcome to try it with us, even without joining. Requirements for all of them are pretty minimal, T3 destroyers are the biggest ships we typically use.
---
Seems they give up even faster than the null blocs.
---
Yeah I had an alt in there for a while trying out fw. Really cool guys, I had a lot of fun doing small fw fleets. Best of luck to them
---
Eve is one of the few MMOs with permaloss. It's one of the few games that'll get my heart beating during combat, or making me feel dread as I navigate past gate camps with a cargohold full of loot. I don't feel that in other games.
---
I want to suffer, only reason why I play EVE
---
I found that the new launcher automatically has the save account feature turned off.
---
With it off, it forgets all accounts after you close the launcher or even if the launcher gets an update.
---
Tldr: Tick the save all accounts box in launcher settings
---
WTF dude... LOL
---
So the latest update actually just changed that. Now you can go to any station or citadel and click the “board my corvette” button in order to get a new starter ship.
---
you mean, like evan mclean? xD
---
You're

Had to reenter 80 accounts yesterday.
---

Because I'm still having fun. 
---
The common trend I see in your post is you want you're hand held through everything. That is not the eve way. The dev's will take you part of the way there but it's on you for the rest of it.
---
T2 BPOs don't produce nearly as much profit as you think. They're valuable but more as a novelty than their profitably. 
---
Solo PVP is rarely against solo players. It's been that way forever. Honestly,  that's what I enjoy about it. How do I deal with it. There's ways. The ship type and fit helps but a lot of it is learning how to take fights and split fleets into manageable pieces.
---
Ease up on the salt my boy it's not good on your health

No, it's defending your air.

We do at least 5 fun fleets a day and have constant content. Yes we do pve too and krabbing in this game is boring

BUT THE ELITE ATRON PVP IS GLORIOUS.
---
We are doomed, DOOMED i say!
---
You will be obviously drowned in all possible variants of "lol n00b go play WoW", but generally you are very right. The only reason I keep playing this horribly broken game is that I remember playing it back when it wasn't full of reddit shitposters afraid to undock. Lowsec was alive, not great but alive, nullsec had some meaningful wars. I would really like to explain to you how you're wrong and how EVE is great but... You aren't and it isn't.
---
So Aider, the guys that created fedup are leaving the alliance?
---
The first time CCP screwed up with the UI was in 2007, on two points : The size of the icons in the "Selected Item" panel, and the overheat system.
---
The "Selected Item" panel has many icons depending of the target, and it could be setted big or small manually. CCP said "not anymore", and decided that it should switch automatically. But because of that, to be sure to have big icons, said window must take a ridiculous amount of space... I used it all the time and it was still the old school 1024\*768 resolution, so I couldn't afford to waste space. It was a downer.
---
A small visible green bar appears above an overheated module, but at this time the color used was a very dark green, not so different of the activation color... Many time I lost weapons because I didn't see that the overheat was still activated, so I stopped using it for years. They changed it at a moment, now it is fine...
---
I can go long. The deletion of the RGB sliders is in my **Top 10 of the worst programming decisions in video game history.** At the same time they also made all windows buttons in a light grey, making them easy to miss when needed. They corrected that three years later, but I lost count of how many times I was annoyed because I thought I clicked at the right location of the X...
---
The colorless buttons of the Neocom, etc.
---
So I can make this statements without being wrong :
---
\- They do have people who develop the code behing the UI, but they don't have any professionals who THINK the UI, how it should react depending of the gameplay, etc.
---
\- They develop using their hardware as references (large monitors, high GPU specs, etc), not with what the players has.
---
\- They know all of that, and they don't care.
---
So this image is the most appropriate one. It just miss a legend : « Oh, you want a better UI ? » and we have the official CCP answer on this subject, which is to go \*\*\*\* ourselves.
---
They can add whatever they want to the gameplay, a great game with a shitty UI will have serious difficulties to attract new players, period.
---
I loved Eve so much back in the day. I don’t have time to play anymore but I think it would fun to spin for you guys out in space.

---
Its kinda good that both sides of this conflict likely feel the same about the mechanics. The current Sov/Structure system is awful :(
---
Would be a little better if they made Citadels in hostile space lose a reinforce cycle, meaning if you flip the sov, they are easier to clear from systems you now own. For example, an Astrahus structures without a service module get no timer, I know that would work against attackers, but attacks tend to be more focused (and willing to fuel them).
---
Use a glamourex 75 booster and run the career agents for your chosen faction as well as the soe arc. Make sure you have your relevant Social skills to 4 or 5. You'll be able to run level 4 missions in a few days.
---
I love kiting PvP in smaller groups, ofc there is a huge skill barrier ingame and irl, however just the combination of the huge variety of ships, doubleclicking in space and the different fittings that allow different ranges for each ship, create a certain freedom while dogfighting/skirmshing all around the grid with battlefields you always have to adapt to.
---
**Even after &gt;7 years there are new PvP situations every single week!** No other game can do that even remotely.
---
That said, the current the state of null and AT cancellation has also burned me out and I went back to my roots in C5 space to revive the deep passion I have for the hunting gameplay.
---
AIDER gets a taste of true nullsec life (CTACTACTAKRABCTACTAKRABCTA) and runs back to lowsec to the surprise of no one.

I tried to tell them nullsec kills alliances
---
You can check if you still have assets in jspace by hitting “alt” and “t” in game. You could also check zkillboard to see if you have a bunch of losses from when the citadel was destroyed/unanchored (wormhole citadels don’t have asset safety). If you still have stuff in the system, you could ask some former corpmates if they could let you in to get your stuff. Another option would be to have a service like eve-scout find the wormhole for you, and to let you in. From there, you can use the asset safety system in order to eject your ships into space (even if you can’t dock), where you can then board them and fly them out.
---
:tinfoil emoji:
---
The biggest thing for a new player is to realise they need to focus on the one thing they like most and devote all their early skill points to it, in a short period you can get on a level playing field, but if you spread your skill points over a wide area its gona take you longer.
---
The issue as a new player is that you have no clue what you like so you need to screw yourself over while you figure it out.
---
Catch 22
---
Wormholes prevented me from winning EVE. I was about there, but I decided to give it a try and I don't regret it a moment.
---
The only good space in this game right now, welcoming to all.
---
AAR or nah?
---
haha^^ that's the vid I though about when I read the title
---
Just glad Realm of the Mad God got a mention on this diagram.
---
Resizing the initial window when the client starts (i.e. making it bigger) results in the scale setting being saved correctly.
---
This is a definite change in behaviour.
---
Been obsessed with it since 2012. No clue why.

I’m surprised at just how awful the new Agency window is. I’m a new player as of Feb. and when I open the Agency window I just can’t parse out what anything means anymore. I literally opened the Agency window last night, tried to figure out what I could do and just threw my hands in the air and signed off. 
---
If I had to pinpoint my fustration it would be the lack of visual data and lack of geographic context.
---
I've just queued a load of social skills, over 2 years of playing and I have not levelled a single one :( Relatively short trains to 4 so not too bad
---
Blob warfare is not made for the line member to enjoy. You are a same piece of cog in PH as you would be in Goons or Test.
---
youre very rude mate
---
Shout out to DJ Accy doing newbie friendly duels in highsec (every?) tuesday.
---
Try it you will see it's not a perfect intel tool... 
---
And remimber if you are the first to probe the WH theo other side don't see you unless you travel across, and when you go inside ... you are in intel.
---
No change. Only a new "we looze beacause of CCP" to justify why some group of hunter are bad.
---
Fak then where's my jerrrrrrrrrb
---
Pot meet kettle
---
I repeated what CCP has said repeatedly about wormholes, yes. That’s a fact, whether folks like it or not. 
---
I think it’s safe to say when I’m poking fun at someone that it’s a joke. 
---
I did not campaign to the wormholers, which is what you predicated your comment on. Not only are you humorless, you can’t admit when you’ve made a mistake, which is another serious flaw in a candidate.
---
This has already been posted, multiple times.
---
Can an alpha clone be a wormholler or should I just stay in nullsec.
---
Most Tuesdays yes he was not here this week I actually covered his show last night has he is on holiday
---
Join a small group struggling to do something, enjoy the victory and defeat. Put in the effort to build something which can't be done alone, but which you are an essential part of the team. 
---
All corps started this way, before becoming a victim of success. The larger and more entrenched an organization the less it has to offer. You aren't recruited to TEST or Horde or Goons to become a key member, you are recruited to cheer them on with your little spaceship. For many, that is enough -- just give them a sports team and tell them it means something to stand in the bleachers and cheer "hon hon hon hon". These big teams tend to get a lot of victories and few smashing defeats, so it feels good to believe you are a part of that team. 
---
But if you want to actually do something in EVE, waiting for a fleet ping isn't going to get you there.
---
Have your revenge :p
---
I noticed, lol
---
In fact it's a perfect intel for hunter who can see what people farm from far before go to they're system.
---
Good change for people who know how to hunt.
---
You and your friends should really try faction warfare, I'm willing to be you'd find alot more fun in that than the nullsec blob life. Give it a shot!
---
You don't play eve for the mechanics.  
---
As for 'don't mention friends', utter hogwash.  You play eve for the friends, friends who are not like your bullshit little 'buddies' in other MMOs, but friends who, because EVE has absolute loss mechanics, are \*actually fucking sacrificing something for you\*.    
---
And you play for the absolute screaming terror that is combat.    
---
Is it unfair?  Damn right it is, but here's the thing, it's unfair because the people you're fighting \*know how to make it unfair\*.  It's a skill you develop over years.  One of my corpmates just obliterated a Garmur in a Tormentor yesterday.  The Balanced Legion should have wiped the floor with him.  
---
   
---
Another skill you develop over years is recognizing situations that will make a fight not go your way and either avoiding or mitigating them.  Dscan, situational awareness, good scouting of a system, cloaking, knowing when NOT to cloak, DOTLAN, knowing your engagement profile, knowing the engagement profile of your opponent...  You currently do not know these things and other folk do and they are well practiced at maximizing their advantages and minimizing yours.  
---

---
Oh dang, I haven't been browsing r/Eve as religiously as usual and didn't know.  Thanks for the heads up, mods will probably nuke it then.
---
makes more sense when you take a good look at the state of fw
---
Which part of we are 200 people come and join us NOT recruitment?  Of course it is...
---
No ones salty just post in the right sub..simples..
---
Finally CCP came to their senses.
---
i liked the two categories of ship
---
* bracket
---
* BIG bracket
---
Can confirm.
---
why this "code is old" garbage is a constant and accepted excuse for ccp's bullshit is beyond me. look at blizzard. sure, they probably had a few more people working on it, but they basically revived a 15-year old game with wow classic
---
lol a friend of a friend apparently has to login 186 accounts again
---

---

---
Oh :(
---
We don't want the space.
---
shit that would have been so bigbrain
---
there is no session change timer on anything in the list there.
---
How do you sub that many accounts?
---
After 3 years I still feel like a newish player. Enjoying the game tremendously every day. I like how there's tons of stuff to do and a very wide range of doing it very badly to very good. Other games require a bit of brain activity at the start but quickly become easy for me. Eve remains hard. It forces me to use my brain a lot. It's an actual challenge and other games now just look like retard/little children/normie games to me.
---
Solo pvp, where you preferrably do include a scout/tackle alt is something you can get ok-ish in pretty early on. Theres so much advice in this regard but its a lot to take in and real time practise is essential too. Its a long road to get good, but you can skill up pretty quickly into a t2 cormorant, retribution or other frigate stuff. I got my first solo kills from flying around in a corm hunting whatever popped up in the intel channel of my alliance. As a total noob I still managed to get solo wins against assault frigates from players of established alliances like tuskers, PL and BL. 
---
I don't have any advice on pve/industry. I slowly work to get into it cause I want to get good in that too, but due to a busy job IRL I just buy plex and mostly sink time in roaming and alliance fleets.
---
I think u made the right choice going for Horde. I learned the game as a renter in null first and later got into a small alliance in GOTG when the war with Goons started early 2018. That provided me with pvp content 23/7 for a full year without being part of a big blop and what I perceived would be less personal interaction, except for the coalition fleets which were very blobby. You are correct that skillurself is not an alliance for new players. They also don't seem to talk in game, ever, but here on reddit and on streams Ive seen them very friendly and helpfull towards newer players including myself.
---
While your template after effects intro with copy pasted logo is great, how about telling the fine virgins of /r/eve a little about your official pvp NPSI alliance?
---
what is this? a drake for ants?!
---
&gt; I won’t refuse free money, but I’m just trying to keep someone who plays eve playing eve
---
Players now doing more for player retention than ccp ever have. 👌
---
I for one like it, it's tiring jumping from system to system for an hour to find nothing of value to do.
---
This way I can find content near me faster.
---
I had this same issue. If you look on your task manager the launcher doesn't seem to close properly if you close it normally and remains in the background. Kill those launchers in your task manager then fire up the launcher, hopefully it will then still remember you.

The person who managed the soundcloud most likely got laid off, hence the last upload being about 11 months ago. I am still waiting for the soundtrack of the Revelations II trailer, which imo is the best of all the trailers still. Needs a re-release with current graphics tho.
---
To be totally honest with you: I’m not waiting to see Star Wars and Star Trek ships in EVE Online. My cynic self would love to see someone make one of the more expensive Star Citizen ships and fly that in EVE... 
---
In general I do believe it’s something that could be given to the players so that we could make EVE that bit more real.
---
I have a few ideas with regards to Alphas and Omegas.
---
There’s really no end to what is possible. there.
---
No, I'm not  
---
As I've already mentioned - This is  just the reading of atmosphere and propaganda from a completely new player. Don't take it to the heart.  
---
You have very bad reputation or people just used to blame you. I don't know which one because as a new player I have almost zero means to check.  
---
Actually instead of  taking offense, you can learn from it and work on your image If you care enought ofc
---
What happened between FEDUP and WANGS left a terrible taste in my mouth :(
---
All the structures are AU tz, which at least historically is GOTG their main TZ.....  
---
On the Imperium show Sort explained how and why they are neutral in this conflict. He did include some goon dick sucking but on the war he seemed clear. And as said theres nothing on zkill either. Could you point me to any source or facts that indicate they might be a party in this war?
---
&gt; please tell me why are you playing EVE in 2019? 
---
I don't lol
---
you'll find a lot of optimism in this thread but the reality is, coming into the game as a new player atm there's very little to do other than VNI rat and F1 monkey, unless you wanna blow your wallet on injectors
---
TY, it means I made my homework good enough in these months
---
*Upvotes every time.* 😎
---
AIDER wanted to do FW and still be apart of FEDUP. FEDUP leadership forbid it because of their null commitments, so here we are.
---
Ok, so our corp inhabits a nice cozy C2 (with C3/HS static) and has set up a moon ore and PI for easy isk.  Currently when we want to hit the ore and take it all down, we would roll all our connecting holes and -not- warp to them thereby keeping the K162 from becoming visible on the other side.   We were running under this assumption of WH mechanicis:  [https://forums.eveonline.com/t/k162-spawn-mechanics/8767](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/k162-spawn-mechanics/8767) 
---
So if i am understanding this correctly, with this update, the K162 is now IMMEDIATELY visible in the connecting system?  If so this really sucks for those of us who rely on a couple of hrs of relative safety to deploy a mining fleet in WH space.  ugh.
---
You find and share fun in EVE by playing. Not copy pasting the words of bitter vets from Reddit to farm internet points. No you won't get content immediately, that's not what EVE is and never has been. It's slow, tedious and not rewarding. We play EVE because we're capsuleers, not because EVE is a game.
---
TLDR: Login
---
We did it boys! Run back to the abyss you cowards! Op success! Op success!
---
But there are productive ways to do that, I think a big strength of a good CSM member is being able to present information/ideas/counterpoints in a respectful/professional way. This is something I've taken to heart with all my interactions, and it's totally okay if people disagree and think being more strong-armed with ideas is a better approach.
---

The faction war wrinkle is a great a red herring that I’d imagine a majority of legacy aligned corps had to exploit to allow for a peaceful withdrawal of assets and clones.  There’s the kernel of truth in here:  legacy is being poorly administered and biases for and against member corps and individuals within corps who are deemed “above the law”.   There’s certain people who for example can welp a faction super to simple farmers on a fucking undock of Braves main fortizar vs others who can’t even park a single Rorqual in an anom(because they won’t rent moons out at reasonable rates) unless they have 2 dictors/hics on grid.  
---
Many legacy alliances/corps within are poor with shitty policies in place “to keep people safe”  that do nothing but stifle available content to the point joining meaningless “CTA/Stratop” raitaru bashes become about the only thing you’re “allowed” to do.  The truth is legacy is a very wobbly stool.   I see one of two outcomes:  they all fold into TEST or are forced out of space by winterco in the coming summer months.  TEST is making a huge push now that vily is back from another afk irl bender.   How long will that last?  Will progod decide to make an effort to help his weary co-general?   Will new leadership step up who are interested in more than just posting sensational goku videos?   Will AoM overtake all of them??
---
We got used to the null life. The issues is that AIDER likes both null and FW. FEDUP refused to allow AIDER to do both so AIDER had to make a choice and chose FW.
---
Define decent. Because It really depends on your taste. Personaly I like GW2 and waiting for crowfall.
---
I'll have you know that I have an excellent reputation. Why only just last week Elo Knight himself named me man of the match and awarded me with a fine house red. How dare you!

Ladies and gentlemen, this is Mambo Nr 5
---
Wait what? First of all I am a Horde member (and only have 3 accounts total, Mr. 300 alts) and you fell for flairbait on /r/eve (not a good trait, is it?) so idk if I am defending anything. I am actually of the opinion that multiple votes should not be a thing, it's just that (I think) your idea is shit. That can happen, you are *not* all-knowing.
---
As for your other point, u w0t m8. *Steam* does not require your name. I just checked. It is only required for confirmation for *some* forms of payment. Now if you are going to claim that *Steam* does not have any online games on it... well...
---
And giving a false name is technically an EULA breach. While most people do not give a shit, I still do *not* want to *be forced to break legal agreements* to exercise what used to be my default right.
---
Either way, you have clearly proven to not look at an issue from all points of view and let your dislike blind you. Not who I personally want on the CSM.
---
Again, the fact that a thing called skill exists doesn't mean you can't pay for % increases.
---
The only comparison that is valid is two otherwise equal people, 1 who has paid for plex and another who has not.
---
The person that paid for plex gets a straight % advantage from better mods, better ship, better skills.
---
Imaging adding stuff like lost beacons, generated ship wrecks, lost NPCs needing assistance, or anything like that in W-space.
---
It would make for pretty good exploration content instead of "map your wormhole daily and find a Sleeper site". W-space isn't really supposed to be a space where nobody goes and nothing happens. It's just an alternate space but everyone has access to it. Your capsuleer isn't someone more special than any other or any other NPC in EVE, there's no reason for stuff to not happen/never have happened in W-Space.

Hi! Thanks for your comment!
---
Orthrus couldnt kill the garmur mostly because it was guidance disrupted with optimal range script.  Orthrus is still very fast with HG snake implants and abyssal MWD, so actually it took 2 garmurs to completely DEFANG him.  You can see that untill the second garmur caught up, I had my guidance disruptor mod overheated so I dont die XD
---
!remindme 2 hours
---
Maybe I made this post too and flairbaited myself, to try and destabilize fedup so they will merge into TEST, folding all of legacy into test slowly, madly, deeply, until my master plan is revealed... the jita plan I call it.  We abandon our sov, we abandon null, we sit in jita, logged in, all the time.  Not actually shooting anybody other than the undock, but filling the system constantly so no commerce can get done.  Then we buy all the tritanium, we use it to build rifters.  Going back to our roots we'll say.  fun fleets of rifter gangs, tormenting lowsec, biding our time until pandemic legion regains it's former glory and retakes the southeast for a massive rental empire.  In that rebuild, a member of PL long forgotten comes back to the game ^^^^^^whiskeycat , revitalized by his friends all having fun again.  Then, as soon as his return is confirmed, TEST makes an announcement for a sota next weekend. ^^^^^whiskeycat.  We announce the ruse, we resub our supers and titans and with the added power of all of legacy under one banner we start bashing, killing, pillaging. ^^^^whiskeycat.  Brought to their knees once again by TEST, I open a dialogue with PL FCs.  "bring me... whiskeycat" I say.  Confused, he wanders into the chatroom, hoping he'll be able to stop the carnage.  Whatever could dran want from me?  he mutters to himself.  "what do you want?" he says, scared, powerless, penniless, with the fate of his alliance resting on his shoulders.  I look up at him in the chat window through the webcam I don't have but do it for dramatic effect anyway...

---
Delve is now cold. It's really nice right now. Constant defensive or offensive fleets (depending on who you are).
---
You might be seen as a nobody in the beginning but that's true with anything you don't create yourself. In Goonswarm you are heavily encouraged to do things and become a member in the community. It's hard because it's a large group but more rewarding if you succeed. Goonswarm also has a lot of groups you can join depending on your interests which will help you integrate and do things you like.
---
You don't have to love The Mittani, just don't say that out loud.
---
Also, the guys dying in their crab ships in delve right now are not what makes The Imperium strong. We're strong because even the PvP focused members contributes. The guys who die in expensive ships right now are a very small minority. The imperium is the strongest because everyone is encouraged to create wealth. Instead of finding empty system after empty system in the North you will find a lot of activity everywhere in Delve.
---
Do like everyone else and turn audio off, as a bonus it also decrease lag in large tidi fights
---
That’s one hell of an exaggeration... I’ve logged in this year ;). You might have also noticed that I’m still lurking on the discord server too, but apparently not...
---
So, essentially what we're doing is turning NCPL off and then back on again, and hoping it fixes the problem?

---
&gt; all points of view

This is r/Eve mate. Everyone has a quarter-developed opinion they are willing to defend to death. If you think proposing CCP to do what other companies typically do is disastrous then your point of view is false. Has nothing to do with my dislike.
---
&gt; Mr. 300 alts
---
You realize this just supports my case right?
---
&gt; you fell for flairbait

Everyone can join Horde. Most people who argue against 1 person = 1 vote are the establishment nullseccers with many alts. My generalization is safe. Ofc there can be exceptions.
---
Trigs are pretty much pulling Sansha Incursion 2nd edition, and just like sanshas it's just slightly fucky that they're fine to let the sansha/triangles aggro capsuleers but we can't gank
---
You are speaking of items of limited supply vs items that will keep being farmed.
---
Same - well, I played in 2003, but very briefly. Hit it hard in 2012 though.
---
Cry more about how you want EVE to be safe, sweetie
---
Yes and I rebooted the computer. Same deal. Sometimes it had it, sometimes not.
---
I haven't seen them scram. Are you certain they do?
---
Because CONCORD are very happy to shoot capsuleers after being given their big boy Jove toys, but rogue drone swarms/sansha incursions/trigs are new and scary to them so they don't risk it. Probably taking the goon/tapi approach and trying to blue trigs RN
---
I **do** hope as well. However, CCP feels out of touch and|or having fractured vision for EVE future.  
---
I'm just not getting this current itteration of EVE and It fills me with sadness.

It wasnt, at the time, known to be limited supply. They were also low in demand. They were very cheap until a few days in when people figured out that they cause no standings loss for missions and could be used to farm +10 real fast, and the price dipped up.
---
These trig components are listed as worthless now because they just came out. A price hasnt normalized for them, and as such any valuation of them, either in game, or thru third party websites is not going to represent an accurate value of the item.
---
&gt; I repeated what CCP has said repeatedly about wormholes, yes. That’s a fact, whether folks like it or not.
---
You repeated a fact in an irrelevant context to justify CCP's wrong actions. Unintended gameplays equally deserve maintenance if legitimate and valuable. Any CSM should know that by default.
---
&gt; I did not campaign to the wormholers
---
You promised to represent everyone. If a wormholer took you on that promise and voted for you, then you'd have failed them.
---
&gt; you can’t admit when you’ve made a mistake
---
I can say the same for you. The number of downvotes (despite Imperium having numerical superiority in r/Eve) on your initial post show many other people thought you were serious.
---
Is this saying your skill farm alts make $.60 a month in profit?
---
They deal mostly EX and TH (about 60/40 split). Weakest against explosive and thermal (similar split).
---
But what if I'm ganked by npc?
---
Exactly. I get that it causes issues when we'd fly to high sec to kill astrahaus, but AIDER having to give up its heritage was too much to bear. See you in low sec! No personal hard feelings towards SNUFF or RDRAW.
---
Square game window. WHAT IS THIS, 2007?!
---
Just a few days ago one of our guys in a gang tackled a raven navy issue, they dropped a wyvern. In the span of the next two hours we hazed a harpy and a ferox fleet until test arrived and jumped in their blobcaps.
---
Each fleet outnumbered us.. fighting the blob is fun &lt;3
---
&gt; However, CPP made a system where trust is a luxury not everyone can afford. Spy accusations are everywhere. Mostly joking. But there's a grain of truth in every joke. I want to trust my corpmates not to be afraid of them or even FC or CEO.
---
You have been playing with the wrong people. Look for a smaller group.
---
I mean as triglavians are not capsuleers or even citizens of New Eden, but a foreign armed force, it sounds logical imo that it is not the police (Concord) that should deal with them.
---
Similarly, if a country invades another country with its military, it is not the police who fights the invaders, but if meanwhile a citizen robs a bank, that is now in the scope of the police.
---
Aside of that, I too would like to see some interaction of the invasion with the ganking system, favoring the mostly unsung heroes who keep highsec falling into a hello kitty theme park.
---
Good post but lacks gay space sex themes
---
We specialize in taking day one newbros. It's not that difficult to design a fleet comp that benefits from having a low sp pilot along.
---
It's harder in jspace than nullsec because of the short distances engagements happen in, but reminding them to burn hard away before engaging helps immensely.
---
I bet....my time in legacy when they didnt allowed individual corps to do their own moon reactions and forced to be on every fleet, calling everything a cta and defending everything that belonged to other people....too much space to cover and baby sit the russian in tenerifis, evictus in immensea, then fedup, warp and the other legacy pets
---
Legacy code isn't because it's old. It's because there's a lot of it, which interacts in complex and sometimes unintuitive ways.

But that's not the comparison. The one who paid plex for SP didn't spend as much time *actually playing* as the one who got SP by being subbed. Probably.
---
If you have 1000 hours in front of the game, undocked, shooting at things, and you want to spend some IRL $$ to get those T2 large beam lasers so you can fly your new corp's fleet comp, more power to you, says me. You'll be able to use them right pretty quick. That's not "pay to win" as the term is commonly applied in other games.
---
You're forgetting CCP gives you half of that to begin with.
---
From what i've heard they seriously lowball offers for people who want to work for them.
---
It’s more that the buffer zone between TEST and Frat is a war zone where these smaller corps/alliances have zero strategic say in what goes down.  Guys get sick of constant CTA pings for sov defense or rorqual/super saves or whatever and want to play the game they wanna play.  In this case that’s back to low sec.  I hardly blame them.  
---
TEST needs to quit fighting a proxy war thru legacy, offer to absorb the willing groups into their official TEST proper and absorb the sov from impass to catch into Immensea and set free those perma crabber corps to go back to renter space.   The best case scenario is TEST takes over all sov and establishes a maginot line of forts/KS between frat and the rest of saferish crab space and consolidates leadership away from the circle jerk that is legacy.  This will create a nearly permanent war zone that’s also not someone’s crab home and allow for a more sustained and measured approach to this aegis sov warfare mechanic.

You would have loved the Eve of earlier years, but sadly those days are long gone. It´s a cash cow for bottom tier whales that´s running on its last leg these days. Don´t bother.
---
letting him think the jita plan is his plan is my plan
---
Maybe you are right. Horde has many nice people, but they feels more like colleagues. Kind of missing the coziness of small groups. However, sometimes colleagues could become your friends. Nevertheless ty for advice,  I'll think about it.
---
Oh look. It me.
---
It'd be great if this were toggleable.  PLEASE change this.
---
Way too much space to cover for these small groups.  The ADMs are low across legacy space.   Representative of unused systems.
---
:thonking:
---
&gt; poor or bitter attitude, age bias, odd sense of entitlement
---
Asshole much?

"WANGS left a terrible taste in my mouth :("
---
Updoot for the most underrated comment in this thread.
---
;)
---
These guys are just trying to fill up your hangars with worthless carbon.  I'll take them off your hands for free.
---
Hey guys. I am technically an outside observer in this, but this is what my two cents are.
---
AIDER has defined itself as a FW group for a very long time. When we moved to null, a lot of members were not very happy but went along with it to be a team player and with the expectation that we would still have a FW focus.
---
As the State have now retaken the warzone, the interest was to fight back. However, FW fleets and Null CTAs came into conflict, and thus these are now two distinct efforts. 
---
I don't see bad blood between the groups, and we will continue to promote each other. It seems to me that this will only make us stronger and more ability to be everything we need  to be in EVE Online. FEDUP - AIDER - MALRO all space is covered.
---
I think they have to do something with eve.
---
They should just call it "EVE Online - BETA" like everyone else now days
---
If a country invaded another country with its military, the police wouldn't be going round saying people need to go investigate invaded towns and to go grab their pitchforks to go fight the enemy. CCP have made it clear enough that CONCORD is more than a police force, but at the same time not willing to deal with any real threat.
---
Is this game no longer profitable and they're secretly trying to kill off their own customer base?  
---
Game sounds worse every time I heard anything about it.
---
vily need blue buffer
---
him want safe space taperium 4.0
---
Thats old EVE.     
---
Now the bartender offers :          
---
* ability to use stylish glass in various colors $10-35 each ^(actual single skin price in PLEX)             
---
* ability to drinking 'home' brew whiskey ^(from piss) at double the price ^(extractors/injectors)
---
Wasn't that sir, sorry to burst your bubble. But hey, thanks for playing! 
---
I am proud though that you are embracing your idiocy and keeping your Reddit name! Not many can type the shit you do and keep a straight face. Bravo!
---
Wales
---
Althought it's fun, I don't see why people would continue to do invasions after 1 or 2 weeks. It's not worth doing it. There is almost no loot, and the loot they drop is not worth to distribute with the whole fleet needed to kill a battleship.
---
Underrated comment
---
What the flying fuck happened here
---
Never heard of any of these folks, but that there is a nicely worded departure. Hats off to 'em.
---
The eve player should get poured whiskey with cola and when he complains another eve player should run into the bar and call him a carebear and that he should accept it or play something else.
---
Fucking normie REEEEEEEE
---
You asshole, you linked me to the WoW subreddit and now I need to go get checked.
---
&gt; And in this case it's only required if you want to vote.
---
So we're losing a right we previously had (for reasons you consider important). I hope you agree with me on this one.
---
&gt; PS: For most (A+) online games you can't get away without some kind of payment at some point.
---
A lot of that can be done with paysafecard (Steam) which does not require PI at any time or Paypal at which point you at least have a single company with your info, not half a dozen.
---
&gt; This is r/Eve mate. Everyone has a quarter-developed opinion they are willing to defend to death. If you think proposing CCP to do what other companies typically do is disastrous then your point of view is false. Has nothing to do with my dislike.
---
So we should not strive for something greater, to be better than average, just because we probably won't achieve it? Thanks, but I disagree.
---
&gt; Taking votes away from literally 30 people who'd be uncomfortable giving CCP real names or fake names is better than letting SP farmers sell thousands of votes to candidates who don't deserve to be on CSM.
---
And I suppose you have any data to back up your claim of the mentioned group being so minuscule they don't count?
---
&gt; You realize this just supports my case right?
---
People generally want moral high ground before arguing a moral case, but you do you.
---
&gt; Everyone can join Horde. Most people who argue against 1 person = 1 vote are the establishment nullseccers with many alts. My generalization is safe. Ofc there can be exceptions.
---
Personally I think generalization of views (you disagree with real name policy -&gt; you most likely are a goon rorqual miner) in discussions of politics (even space politics) is dangerous as it breeds polarization and kills nuance.
---
Just create a DMZ wasteland of forts and multiple bridge networks to develop multipronged avenues of entry by the various coordinated attacking lines into hostile space.  You could literally flip the narrative from that of constant defense save fleets to having many options of objective based fleets running in all time zones.  Cyno jam the whole line.
---
Pfft, I'll take them and you only have to send me 50T isk
---
What is dead may never die.
---
Stainguys alt posted so at least I get totoast in some epic bread.
---
Makes me hate CCP even more
---
There's no real-world equivalent of CONCORD so I'm unsure of why you're making this completely irrelevant distinction.
---
For the purposes of the game they are far more than a police force and if there's not some lore reason for them not attacking the Triglavian forces, CCP fucked up.
---
I haven't read the update info. 
---
Does this mean someone can view if a system holds data and relic sites instantly upon entering the system? 
---
Does this also mean they are warpable without scanning them down?
---
Looks like some need to learn more than others? An AAR would help
---
&gt; The one who paid plex for SP didn't spend as much time actually playing as the one who got SP by being subbed. Probably.
---
That is definitely not how you isolate a variable to see how it changes something.
---
Basic scientific method.
---
I could drop a bunch of money on plex, start a new char, inject perfect jackdaw skills, purple it, and I'd still lose it within an hour because I don't know how to fly a hacksaw effectively.
---
Player knowledge and skills have more effect on outcomes than SP.
---
The same reason I played GBF,Sekiro,etc. and play FGO.
---
Sure if you remove the rest of the context it sounds stupid
---
you cant effectivly hunt for pvp content, because an alpha cant use a cloak and all scouts have cloaks, but beside that... maybe...
---
You could apply this logic to any radio station, the whole point of radio stations is that you get to listen to music that you may not normally listen to. Get a fucking grip and stop shitting on other people's work.
---
It was intended as "As you progress you start to see exponentially more income with each class" not "C4s shit money"
---
Money can be made in C4s
---
Okay?
---
I'm still not sure what that has to do with being able to buy % increases to power?
---
What he/she means is that the pvp room only opens if there is more than a certain number of people running abyssal sites at that time. Often there is no pvp room available. 
---
And for OP, no there's no way to tell in advance, you just have to run one and see.
---
I've often thought about this. If even can increase server ticks to 10 seconds (full tidi)...why not decrease it below 1 second in normal constellations? 
---
Would be nice to tackle "insta warp" ships that in reality take 1.95 seconds to align...or actually make use of your 2.11s rate of fire bonuses...
---
&gt; TEST needs to quit fighting a proxy war thru legacy
---
Well that's hilarious seeing how Legacy has managed to accomplished absolutely nothing in the war without TEST (besides getting tackled and asking TEST to come save them, with varying results).
---
Repost
---
Because buying a 5% increase to damage dies not buy you a 5% greater chance to win. It's not p2w.
---
yep, then we get yelled at why the adms are so low but always want us in every single fleet and we get yelled at for not going on fleets so...gets people confused and a distaste to even log in
---
lol what's frozen and squishy at the same time?  
---
THIS CORPSE :O
---
baited on a free Fortizar
---
Quick summary: Frt dropped another fort in 46dp. XIX comes with eagles, Test comes with eagles but FC not in monitor dies in 5 secs, so new FC in monitor takes over, but has no fleet warp permissions. Frt comes with a few bomb dreads through gate, stuck in bubbles (lol) and muninns. Fort is kept paused till dt. FRT losing most logi, but test being light in numbers and logi cannot really hold against alpha either. So mostly wild slugging. Wild test FAX gets dropped on enemy fleet, gets nearly blazed (forgot to activate hardeners for the first few secs and reps up from 90% hull), cynoing carriers which get hazed because subcaps are all dead. Due to the carriers starting to align immediately the fax gets out of bubbles as retreat is called and escapes. Today is the day ELO nearly killed my fax. If test would not have fed carriers in the end isk war would have been pretty even (fort was dead when the carriers hit grid), some TEST dread bois thought they were carriers and also appeared, also without HAWs to sit there and die.
---
&gt; So we should not strive for something greater
---
Exactly what I'm doing by offering a solution to vote-buying.
---
&gt; And I suppose you have any data to back up your claim of the mentioned group being so minuscule they don't count?
---
The datapoint that most games take names from people is enough.  They prolly did their research. Steam even asks for phone verification to log in just fyi. Blizzard asks for a real name. EA asks for a real name.
---
Hello kitty skin when?
---
&gt;550379	this bitch better start
---
This is some very advanced "REEE you drop capitals on my small gang fleet" thread if I've ever seen one.
---
I'm generally not a fan of micro transactions but I will ALWAYS pay a lot of money for a hello kitty skin. Doesn't even matter what it's for.
---
Literally that’s my point.
---
Find a group that is fun to play with. Might be hard in 2019 but they are out there if you keep searching. Maybe try FW lowsec and wormholes also.
---
I've always seen FEDUP as more relevant than Evictus tbh
---
Agree...you have no idea how many times TEST gets pinged for help to defend their pets sov or structures...last I remember the russians ([FI.RE](https://FI.RE)) stated they will kill frat and evict them from their space...it has been months and nothing has been done but them pinging test for every Fort kill or SoV defense...  
---
Eventually TEST will get tired of come to the rescue of everyone, a lot of line members are getting weary of having to defend someone else's crap while they cant enjoy the game doing what they like...
---
because we're still more of a threat than the triangles &gt;:)
---
We made over a billion in a matter of a couple of hours so... sorry?
---
Because they got pooped on in cloud ring and pure blind and had to go somewhere else after pissing off all of their former fw allies. merp
---
&gt; One of my corpmates just obliterated a Garmur in a Tormentor yesterday.
---
god fucking bless this man right over there
---
Atleast he gives you bounty
---
You're not wrong.
---
You’re taking what I said out of context. I did represent everybody. Guess what? You don’t have to like or pander to the people you represent. 
---
Every time I post on a WH thread I get downvoted. That’s one of the reasons I do it. It amuses me. That you honestly give a shit about karma is hilarious in a sad way.
---
What mistake did I make months ago that nobody but you seems to remember that I haven’t admitted?
---
I feel like I remember CONCORD being a lot less than their former glory after Yulai. Also they have enough ships to teleport around the universe but I think that's it. A coordinated invasion might be outside of their capabilities.
---
A wow player can walk?
---
Makes me love EVE players even more
---
Try a freighter or an orca
---
Could you please explain why?
---
For me personally, the fun started when we (3-5 RL friends) left the corp we were in and formed our own corp (former corp moved from Syndicate (npc null) to sov null). 
---
We just stayed in Syndicate and picked a station in a not-very-thought-after system. We neither had money nor any skill in pvp... or even skill points for that matter. But we were a bunch of friends who wanted to have a good time together. And yes, we had a blast. 
---
Back then we had no POSes/structures, so nothing that could be attacked. This also means no timers, CTAs or any of that shit we didn't like. 
---
We have always flown rather cheap stuff, T1 cruisers for the most part... so we didn't need a lot of money so we could simply shrug it off when dropped/blobbed. We always bought our ships in stacks. If you only lose 10m or so per ship, one high-sec lvl4 mission is enough for quite some pvp fun.
---
Of course you have the blingy ships that can wipe out your whole 5 man gang... if they annoy you too much bring a blackbird or two. damps can be a pain as well... this is EVE, you really don't have to play nice. Piss some people off, it's part of the game.
---
We always saw it as a victory if we were ISK-positiv. Not saying that's the best measure for success, but it keeps morale high since a single blingy ship can "compensate" for a whole night of wiping fleet after fleet. 
---
Expect them to retaliate hard though, so no fancy structures or blingy PVE ships. Spread your stuff out to multiple stations/systems and place JCs there so you can't get camped in. 
---
Some of our pilots kept mission runner alts in NPC-corps to get a steady income even if our systems were camped. I trained my alts fo station trading... so no chance for them to stop us from reshipping. 
---
Many years have passed and that corp is now part of an alliance with a lot of people and structures and so on. Don't get me wrong, still a great corp/alliance with lots of nice pilots and fun fleets... but I'm just not very motivated anymore, stuff got stagnant. 
---
I'm now thinking of taking one of my trading alts and start training it for pvp... move all the isk/assets except maybe 50-100m to another char and only allow myself to sell loot from PVP to buy more ships/modules. See how long I'll last. I'm an engineer by trade so I like a challenge. That's what keeps me going. Who knows, maybe the old fire will be comming back. 
---
It's your free time, it's supposed to be fun/enjoyable. And I don't mean after hours and hours of grinding... I mean ALL OF IT.
---
Just try to find something you enjoy in EVE and start from there.
---
It worked for me last time... maybe I can do it again. I shall see.
---
[What SKINs should have been.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1zab7u/hello_kitty/)
---
That is simply amazing
---
personally i'd like to see a simulated combat arena. various restriction modes, like only meta, or only cruisers, etc...  
---
It'd be really great to just enter que, get a good fight, and learn from it.  
---
New players would benefit astronomically from this. They could git good™ without suffering potentially massive losses. Th...they might even stick around :O
---
Because its ~1/5th of my alts screens when running multiple clients in less than fullHD? Or because it doesn’t scale well even with 90% ui?   
---
Thing is HUGE.
---
whaaaaaat?
---
Do you talk about Hilmar during commercials?
---
It might disrupt the game for enough time to produce emergent gameplay.
---
No more autopiloting freighters for a while - perhaps you can make your money as a DST runner, or a high risk trader moving through the area.
---
Honestly the game is so stale, any change to High Sec might have a huge impact. Look at the impact Citadels had on Perimeter for example. There were and are huge highsec wars over structures because of how valuable they are (Citadels are shit otherwise, but the point still stands).
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76962726/

It was a thing of beauty.

I personally don't lol
---
What makes you say that?
---
Thanks man! I’ll check it out. Can I use my decks?
---
Keep your mitts off him goonie goon blobber!
---
why do you guys all capitalize my name
---
I just purchased the 'in rust we trust' nag skin. could have used that on war efforts. or perhaps dinner.
---
the rest of the comments are offering a pretty nice insight into the dev process too
---
&gt; 550380 this mayube happens after the timer starts or maybe before   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; 550383 this pops a message in local, I guess?
---
Yeah, some people have done T5 frigate electricals solo with shiny rets.
---
I've always wanted to do a "This New Eden Life" podcast with interviews/stories about things that happened in eves past. 
---
Whats the best way for someone to get involved with eve radio to make a show/podcast like that possible?
---
Yeah as long as they connect to your pc. Be sure to say DJ Ross told you to apply 😁
---
Simply follow the recruitment tab on the website. If you have any more questions pm me
---
Give me that over character customization any day.
---
I'd still play eve if I had to start fresh. Eve is about the friends and the space-drama.
---
Certainly, you can fairly "easily" (you have to not be an idiot and manually pilot, but ya know) run T3 electrical sites with a retribution, some bling is required, but it's doable. I don't have any implants (other than 3% gunnery ones). I imagine T4's would be quite possible in two of them since you can mostly avoid damage by keeping range with your mwd while you kill the things that can web/scramble you. Running a T4 solo -might- be possible, but if you got a spawn of renewing leshaks you might just be screwed.
---
Are the fits shown on the official eve website any good resist/rep wise? I don't know how much dps the rats do there...
---
Joining a fleet welcome to session change timer. 
---
Undock, welcome to session change timer. 
---
Move in fleet welcome to session change timer.
---
Also if you havent realized yet a lot of in game calls utilize their own api on the backend of the server. But then again I guess 20 year old programming languages which have been updated countless times will work quickly and perfectly no matter what.
---
What is their range? What do i need to look out for
---
I'd be lying if I said my debugging messages look any better than this lol
---
I live in highsec and enjoy eve soundtrack, so nah.
---
At least I can say mine look way better. Wonder what the comments in their code look like.
---
I literally can't tell what's going on in this table because you don't have titles for any of your columns or rows except for a few...
---
We must rebel against the fascist CONCORD
---
And a new player won't have any friends... they're new.
---
hopefully better than
---
&gt;548894   sdfg
---
pretty much any assault frig which can tank \~50 dps and do 200 dps will easily be able to run a T1 site. Just start there and when you feel comfortable move up. If you can run a TX site in 10 minutes, you should be fine running a TX+1 site without hitting the timer (damage tanking might be an issue though).
---
I have an alpha alt who I fly with my brother and we run T1 dark sites in kestrels, so the level of difficulty is pretty low.
---
Triglavian and concord ships can engage each other in high sec. Any ship attacking triglavian npcs can be attacked by triglavian ships, any ship attacking a ship attacking triglavians can be attacked by concord ships.    
---
This could be extended to navy ships since concord ships aren't that good.
---
And maybe only in triglavian invaded systems
---
An npsi alliance? Does that mean corp members not in fleet have a free for all?
---
Can I make the same pun twice?
---
imagine if each alliance could, for some large price, create a skin set for a doctrine ship (or some basic color/motif scheme that would sweep over ALL ships).
---
Bee stripes for goons, black on white for test, etc..
---
this would make null fleets really impressive (maybe force the skin during fleets, or give the option to?) and give a bit of "uniform" to random ships elsewhere.
---
temp debug logging is like the one place you can have some fun and not impact anything.  I'm sure their comments are actually informative, stop over-analyzing things.
---
I don't know about duos, since I usually solo T3 darks in a hawk. I think in that case, getting shiny shield reps is probably the most important for tanking. However every time I've died so far is from zoning out and not completing the site in time. With 2 people doing T3s that shouldn't be a problem at all.
---
I feel like T4s would be pretty easy to duo, but I dont have any experience with that.
---
Wow. The TLDR is the real question and primary issue in EVE. If you can find and share fun in EVE, it's probably great. Unfortunately, it's entirely dependent on the random chance you find people that you enjoy hanging out with AND have similar interests in this game. That's a tall order. I never found those either. Without those things EVE is subscription based boredom. It seems like it could offer a lot but everything seems so broken and/or incomplete.
---
You are missing the point of what a radio show is.
---
that’ll show ‘em!
---
It's possible. What I suspect would happen would depend on where it was implemented. 
---
Too far away from trade routes, it's irrelevant, only catching the odd noob. If it's right on a trade route, it wouldn't take long to have that system camped by a larger group farming kills.
---
It probably would have a big impact, but I'm not certain it would be a positive one.
---
Yes as it should be. Safety is boring. This is EVE.
---
It can only work with a good team.
---
Sadly fights happened mostly in late EU/early USTZ so there's that.
---
But you're right, I got nothing on their participation, I'll just assume that if any big fight happen they'll show up because sort is a backstabbing bitch.
---
Who?
---
My friend, it's look like you don't like the gameplay you got in megablop 0.0 (afk VNI as Pve and F1 monkey as Pvp)   
---
so, just move elsewhere.  
---
As I see you were in Eve Uni, I advise you to check their WH campus. Or any other newbros friendly WH corp.  
---
- no diti  
---
- no capblop  
---
- no blop at all (30 people is a very big fleet)  
---
- tons of small skirmish everyday  
---
- tons of Isk but no afk  
---
that's how I have fun everyday  
---
(ok, this is WH propaganda but LS or even 0.0 in smaller structure can be fun. just don't stay with the blob if you don't like it...)
---
The most fun I’ve ever had in this game was the year and a half I spent in AIDER doing FW stuff. I can finally return!
---
Then you clear it. That's the point. It drives people being in space doing stuff and, often, contrary to each other. 
---
I guess it's just me but shaking the sandbox keeps the sandcastles from getting too high and allows for different, unique experiences
---
Why not approach those content creators about sharing their content via eve-radio? Maybe that's an idea
---
&gt; I did represent everybody. 
---
Representing implies understanding and caring about their problems/interests, and acting/voting accordingly when the time comes. You didn't. Again, you have a really twisted sense of representation due to your profession as a lobbyist.
---
The mistake I was talking about was you bringing up how CCP never intended for people to live in wormholes to justify removal of the HIC mass reduction without a solution to wormhole rolling.
---
You can turn off everything but music
---
And for ammo i need to bring every kind (missile) i see each rat has different resist (depending also on weather)
---
One of the problems with this is having been a member of any player corp. Once you join a corp and leave it you are forever seen as a potential spy. This leaves you with having to be right on the first try. Even being a member in an NPC corp makes people suspicious unless you are brand new. They view your pilot as an alt and spy for your main account. So in the end you have to choose your final corp quickly and accurately.
---
In the end the EVE mentality of "trust no-one" means that your friends are not your friends anyway.
---
Because you're lazy and want a super umbrella and LP prices are annoying
---
Yea, that is weird ELO.
---
What is you're dps in a hawk? Also the hawk fit on the eve official website has two cap batteries, why one is enough to be stable
---
I got Vegas Pro 15 when it was on Humble bundle. I need to look into splitting the Audio when recording. I have 3 tracks selected in OBS, but only two are available in the recording. I assume it has something to do with the container/format on the recording side not supporting more.
---
I need to check how I can get more tracks on the recording side and then how to split game and voice com audio from the main "Desktop Audio". There are options, I just didn't have a reason yet. ^^
---
Thanks for the input!
---
it seems this was the limit ^^^(X-&gt;0) of peoples interest in these puns.
---
Nope. Just join a fleet with a mwd interceptor and burn to wrecks. That is the ONLY way anyone will get anything out of this aside from losing a ship to broken OP bots.
---
This event is literally nothing more than racing to wrecks. You are better off running T1-3 Abyssals or just doing lvl IVs and just buy the stuff from market. You will make more ISK from bounties alone, then add drops and salvage. Basically all Triglavian content is not worth the effort. Let the fools run them and fill the market while you laugh as you buy it all with pennies.
---
Oh look, its the drone renter badposter. Was already wondering when you would crawl out of your hole now that theres trouble coming your way again.
---
🗡
---
 **One of my corpmates just obliterated a Garmur in a Tormentor yesterday.  The Balanced Legion should have wiped the floor with him.**
---
THE CURE FOR CANCER FOLKS RIGHT THERE
---
Because you're so tall
---
Eve is at it's best with medium-sized corp where it's small enough that you're not just another cog in the machine and that you get to know your corpmates, but big enough that there's no "dead zone" during the day, where barely anybody logs in. In a medium corp, you can have an impact in a fight, or be a F1 monkey if you happen to want to be brainless that day. It's big enough that you can be a carebear for a few days to fatten your wallet up while not impacting content generation in your corporation.
---
Incidentally, wormholes are probably EvE at its best right now because corps tend to be in that range.
---
1b, pm me if you accept
---
Well, weather depends on what filaments you use, so you don't need to change missiles except different filaments (mostly)
---
Ummm afaik TEST doesn't have a SP requirement. Maybe Dreddit does, but there are plenty of other, more newbro friendly corps in TEST
---
I thought all the renters left, that was the spin before wasn't it?
---
"Eve classic" Make it happen! :P
---
Good day to you as well  o honourable Sir. I beg for forgiveness because I don't even deserve your precious time. Please leave this begger alone and spread your glory in fair fights with unfaithul NC in Tribute.
---
To be fair, that was a shit killboard to begin with. How does someone lose so many scanning ships? there's not a single kill on that board and they're still 41% dangerous?
---
I once told a former DJ that I would help her escort her stuff though low sec.   
---
I helped her retrieve her stuff, and made it all the way back to the last gate. (This is pre warp to 0, you had to setup slingshots) 
---
Before having my friends brutally murder her bestower on an "incorrect" warp.   She took to the Radio and had all listeners petition me for griefing. 
---
Man, EVE is ruthless.   
---
I am glad to see this is still going after 14 years tho.  It's great!
---
I'm not getting any audio :(
---
Those that scram have the word "Anchoring" in the ship name.
---
Looks like everyone had fun so i would call it a win win situation...well maybe not for tests first fc...ah well lessons learned
---
Are you using the pop out player or the one on the main site?
---
They've been constantly working on it since then, because of neutral logi and the reworking of the wardec system.
---
-1
---
Doesn't fly with alliance.
---
Sounds like a goon sympathizer if you ever listen to him talk.
---
All-around bad for the game.
---
W-Space was never intended to be a permanent place of residence. Wh life is emergent gameplay, you gotta make your own way.
---
ahh, i see they accidentally localized some code comments
---
at least there's not a "// how does this even work LOL"
---

that looks like probably how his tormentor was fitted. for those playing at home.
---
Thanks. I wrote it in a near-panic after it was announced alliance-wide before the details were even arranged.
---
It's not hard to make new friends in eve.
---
Freighters during an invasion 😂😂
---
You have to mouseover the pop-out thingy on the left side and hit the play button.  Took me a sec to find, too.
---
My hawks get about 260 cold before drugs. This is with perfect missile skills (even down to light missile launcher spec 5 😅).
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/76467657/
---
It's this fit for the highs and miss, but lows are faction (for CPU fitting), drop the CPU rig for a damage one, and you rock a 3pct CPU implant to make it all fit. 
---
You might need a deadpace 1MN afterburner too; I use Gist-A iirc.
---
Duo T3 in hawks like this are a breeze, and you can probably afford then to cheapen the fit by leaving the CPU rig and just using T2 BCU.
---
I would say the shield booster is mandatory; it's SO GOOD and will save your butt.
---
Not someone I'd vote personally. Haven't seen him active in the game doing anything beside losing jfs. Listening to him on podcasts he seems like a smart guy but is a  passive pushover, not likely to fight the good fight with CCP if it's needed
---
Getting downvoted by crabs that don't want their LP values to go down.
---
That was it.  
---
Absolute madman.
---
If small-medium sized corps so much fun, why most players blob?  
---
Appreciated your opinion and advice though  
---
will discuss it with friends
---
Alq is a scholar and a gentleman.
---
go to wormholes
---
null is dead zone of anti fun
---
Aren’t you in Snuff?
---
Matterall as a goon sympathizer is one of the most entertaining rumours going round Eve.
---
before i was in a corp me and a friend would daytrip in wormholes, that was years ago so not sure how that works in the current meta but it was fun. But then I learned I like PVP in this game far more than PVE.
---
my first corp was eve university - my fun there was low sec roams and then FCing said roams. 
---
then I graduated to null sec alliances where the ~~only~~ fun is war!
---
I heard he is friends with The Mittani
---
It absolutely does when you compare it.
---
With two otherwise equal player, the one who buys the 5% damage will have an advantage.
---
rep you
---
Said for a while the biggest thing going for Eve is players having sunk a ton of time and money into. Still waiting to see how skill injectors impact that long term.
---
His point was that legacy is irrelevant and only Test matters out of the whole coalition so legacy should be absorbed into Test proper. 
---
You will then be being pinged to save Test at least.
---
Who are you?
---
It's been a bit since I ran missions, but I remember using distribution missions as the fastest way to level up to Level 4s.  You can run most of them in a frigate, then a T1 hauler fit for speed and do it mostly afk.
---
You know they tried to join Imperium before TAPI...right?
---
I get where you're coming from, I'm just not totally convinced turning sections of high sec into a pvp free for all is the way to do it. 
---
CCP are having enough issues with the apparent lack of players fighting each other in low or null without just making it harder for high-seccers to do their care bearing. 
---
The plus side would be the lack of capital escalations, but if you are disabling CONCORD, then those restrictions 'should' cease as well, it becomes an area of NPC nullsec to be farmed by the nearest biggest entity. 
---
If you keep gate and station guns in order to dissuade gate camps, it's then no different from lowsec. 
---
I'm not totally against shaking high sec up, but it would take a lot of careful planning to shake it up without killing highsec (which is supposed to be where the bulk of players live, especially newbies) and not just turning it into a place where the nearest null ow low sec entity hang out to farm free kills for a couple of days.
---
But wouldn't that be, like, the third time an entire expansion is based around "the capitalistic greed of capsuleers results in unexpected consequences?"
---
Methinks there's a tired old message here.
---
Another soul has fallen victim to eve coke.
---
I think if you have the right kid you can teach them to save, like with a piggy bank when they are really young, then with a savings account a bit later, but only if you can negotiate with them to put half of their money into it. If they can't do that, give up and hope they learn it themselves later.
---
I do wonder what is left when the active core of Alwar leaves FEDUP and is now Sons of Luminaire and then the only relevant corp left of FEDUP bails.
---
I do think FEDUP should of set up at least a feeder alliance in lowsec to keep recruiting fresh blood.
---
Since getting recruits as a small nullsec group is like bleeding stones.
---
Probably would of kept their lowsec leaning corps and leaders happy.
---
good for them
---
Make a political show, with debates from both sides of the war and such, to uncover the why's and what's. Allot of new players would decide to join one side or another due to the mental train in the decision taking.
---
Yeah it's not easy, but having a lot of people in the same area of space is good for the game. 80% of people are in HS. Some might hate it, some might enjoy it. I remember though, when the first few blood raider festival things happened, there were tons of fun opportunities for PvP in HS with looting and stuff. It gave people a risk reward mechanic.
---
It obviously has to be balanced against turning HS into a full low sec area but again, maybe people in HS will step up and run the incursion out, a new kind of incursion team appear.
---
Maybe I'm a blind optimist, but new things happening in eve causes new stories. There's too much 'perfect information' scenarios that discourage conflict. A bit of chaos helps break that up
---
Purge the heretic
---
The way he caved with the Hilmar interview and didn't ask anything of value? He's a good mate, just not cut out for Eve's politics.
---
AIDER would basically be that feeder alliance. If AIDER breaks off, that gives FamilyUp the Low Sec branch. FEDUP would be the nullsec branch and MALRO is the high sec branch. As Ashterothi said, "all space is covered."
---
lol TRI
---
Imagine having to get so defensive you write up a meme post to defelect from reality. We all know the 4D Chess Grand Master Valkorsia came up with the idea, that is how we know it was truly big brain. #TapiMemesCantMeltFedupDreams
---
So, I've played EVE basically for a 1,5 month, but I guess I know what my main two reasons for playing EVE.
---
1. Unpredictable, stressful and fun situations that I can encounter.
---
The best place where I can get it, is of course WH's. Wormhole space is full of content. Just yesterday I've jumped into a C3 with my Anathema, and once i got into it, I saw Probe and Curse right near a WH entrance. My heart was pumping so fast, I thought it's going to jump out of my chest. I quickly warped to one of the moons, creating the bookmark, to only realase I forgot to save the location of my exit WH :) Every time I go to WH space, and even hacking a relic site, I actually hope that something unexpected will happen. There is so much adrenaline rush in this. I've also got into a WH once, and a WH that I've entered closed right behind my back..I was in a Heron and there was a Legion on DScan...This type of situations are normal for this space, and that's why a lot of people like to live in WH space so much, you never know what to expect.
---
And I'm a solo player, if I will decide to join WH corp...I think there is going to be 100 times more content. You can also take a nomad approach to this, and just travel from WH to WH looking for some troubles, for me it's one of the craziest and most fun way to play EVE, as a WH nomad. Especially if you use T3 Cruiser, cuz you can hunt people, run from entire fleets of scary wormholers, etc.
---
2. It's actually solo PvP in FW.
---
I will be honest, I'm a noob in this. I've only started to try solo PvP, but for me it's like a card game, strategic game, or something like that. I want to learn that, because for me it's a competition. And maybe I'm a noob, but I know that expensive ships and equipment is not the most important in solo PvP. Only your skills and knowledge is going to get you a lot of kills. And it's easy to find 1v1 fight in FW space. Just find somebody in a plex (like Novice Complex), or jump to this complex yourself, activate acceleration gate, and wait for a couple of minutes...You are going to get somebody willing to fight you 1v1 very quickly even in Amarr space, which is not very populated.
---
I'm very bad at solo PvP right now, mostly because I don't have any type of micromanagment skills at all, I'm basically lose a track of what's happening around me. And I lose like a complete noob .But I'm totally dedicated to learn it, and to become good at it. For me PvP is a great competition, and it's like an art in some way. I even think that it's better to always use fits that you've created yourself. Fitting a ship is a huge part of a strategy, you learn a lot just by doing this and you can get very creative with your fits, which is also very fun thing to do (some people even solo PvP in Ventures, Herons and Logistics Frigates).
---
Well, I hope my answer is going to give you and your friends some ideas about what to try. Even if it's not going to be WH or solo PvP.
---
I think, that if you want to enjoy EVE Online, you should ask yourself just a two questions.
---
What is a the best content for me? (examples: unpedictible wormhole space; EVE politics and diplomacy; ganking and killing everything you see...etc.)
---
What is the best achivement/competition there for me? (examples: to become good at solo PvP; to become a good fleet commander...etc.)
---
Have fun and good luck o7
---
People play this game to have fun, for most that means winning fights and getting kills.
---
The easiest way of doing that is teaming up with others to blob stuff, simple as that.
---
For people who aren't satisfied being f1 monkeys and want to play in an environment where their individual skill matter, medium-sized corp are a better place to go. But this is something that usually attracts the more hardcore players, and the population of this subreddit is definitely more hardcore than the average eve population, which is why you might see so many "blob bad solo good" posts.
---
Lol my favorite part, don't like the agency tab? Don't use it xD
---
Nop, but I made a light grammar check so I hope it looks better for you now.
---
I changed it. Are you happy now?
---
Yep, we killed all the baddies. I got a tshirt and a mug.
---
OK but when and where are they giving away their stuff ?
---
Imagine going from fw into tapi yickes lmao good for them for leaving.
---
and it's not hard to find better games to play if you already have a pre-established group of friends.
---
don't have friends -&gt; play something else.
---
already have friends outside of eve -&gt; play something else.
---
been playing and have friends in eve -&gt;  why are you here, this is about new players.
---
Its a fine and good tackling video, why people whine about it?
---
The actual ship just looks stupid... Hopefully they fix that.
---
I thought the new AI ships were all made using legit stats and modules, and pyfa/fitting window? Instead of the studid Burner-style design where its basically a Curse trapped in the body of a Cruor, or a Vindicator in the body of a Daredevil.
---
It's really frustrating when games do that ~ like when racing games arbitrarily set the stats of AI cars based on how well you're doing in a race, etc.

Isn't it because they are valid buy orders from the station you are in? Ex: regional or within range.

Hi Vai!
---
lame
---
This is awesome!
---
Wait. Did you get soo bored with the goons war that you’ve joined Sanshas FW?
---
Could be interesting to trial something that's for sure.
---
Back after two years.  Two questions:  1) How are the warzones doing? and 2) How have the precursor ships and mutagens changed the solo/small gang meta?
---
Sometimes. You try really hard.
---
&amp; Null blocs in denial.
---
While on the standings booster, be selective on the missions you accept. If you accidentally accept the wrong one - while on booster, you can repeatedly quit with only a 0.001 loss.
---
I suggest running the Blitzable L4 List. those are the L4s that can be completed in 15 minutes or less, like Dread Pirate Scarlet, Cargo Delivery, Recon # 1, Recon, #2, and Stop the Thief.
---
Skip any L4 requiring heavy killing; lots of in-room travel; or grinding down a tanky structure - Gurista/Angel Extravaganza, the Blockade, the Assault.
---
I mostly play on my fedup alt blue scouting
---
Not the same though. The audio card still gets used. 
---
You get the best performance bonus from clicking it all off.
---
But you miss crucial noises like the warmhole warp sounds.
---
Good on you for that but even so I agree with Laz-long, endlessly bitching about it to someone completely unrelated doesnt do anything or help anyone.
---
Light numbers? fuck world you live in? it was barely a 2 to 1 you had more numbers still welped.....oh wait no blobs lol
---
I have questions about suspect timers and criminal status spurred on from some Invasion PvE last night.
---
1. If I take from the wreck of a rat killed by someone else, does it flag me to just them, their corp, their gang, or everyone? Assuming 'their corp'.
---
2. If I salvage a wreck owned by someone else, it doesn't seem to trigger a suspect timer, right? Does anyone know why? I was killing rats in the invasion site and was swarmed by Herons and Catalysts sniping my salvage. Is there any way to legally shoot them for this? It makes me just want to join them instead of trying an incursion. 😅
---
3. I noticed a few yellow/suspect players in the invasion site last night, presumably they did something bad? Beyond being baited, is there anything stopping me from tackling / killing suspect players in the wild like this? If I shoot them, am I also now eligible to be shot by all players?
---
4. Sometimes you see -10.0 red flash people moving through highsec in their pods. If you were to catch them (ex: smartbomb) without hurting someone else, would that be legal?
---
5. Some -10.0 suicide gankers hang out in highsec tethered to a Citadel so they aren't killed by police. If they were bumped off tether, they'd be killable by a player right?
---
How do you know I'm not a valkorsia alt, have you ever seen him and I in the room at the same time?
---
Are you a Chinese player using a VPN? Asking for an alliance.
---
I started up the 64bit client and the graphic settings were too wacked to continue.  Logged a bug and went back to 32bit.
---
Jousting in small gang is fun, many of the Horde guys are pretty chill.
---
You pegged the game pretty well for a "new" player.
---
Looks like real window into why CCP's code is always so damn bad.
---
Gas harvesting is an alpha skill, plenty of ISK to be nade
---
Kinda true
---
Throw em in EWAR frigs!
---
Exactly this, there is an adrenaline rush from fear. There is no fear if you get your time/isk back. This just makes other games seem shallow after playing Eve.
---
That's what it says, yes, but if you check the math it's not true. I've been waiting for someone to point out that it's wrong but I don't think that's going to happen. SP farming is never profitable without supplementing it with ISK generated in-game. Always buy your game services directly from CCP with cash if you want to pay the lowest price. PLEX is good for buying ISK and that's about it.
---
Makes me want to shit post on reddit more.
---
What happened to ALWAR?
---
I once forgot to remove one debug popup in stuff that went to production.         
---
Basically it was like 
---
&gt;
---
this dumb ##### don't know basic stuff about this process this will for sure show up as there is no way this situation will not happen, and he will come back to me whining to rework this thing"
---
Got me through plenty of night shifts. Give these guys a try if you haven't yet.
---
You know because he would not be able to keep quiet about it.
---
You must have gotten lucky.  We ran a 10 man fleet for a few hours and the regular loot was trash, the officer isn't guaranteed to drop loot either.  We killed her like 5 times and got a 100m mutaplasmid once, sub-10m in materials every other time.
---
I’ve been yelling at then in all CAPS LIKE DIS. But they don’t seem to be changing much.
---
Punishment for being a skill farmer.
---
ISBEVE Launcher never forgets any of your account even after any patch.
---
That's because it's a troll table I made from my actual spreadsheet. Farming SP for profit isn't really a thing. You can farm SP *for a discount* off the market price if you consume at least three injectors every month, but you'll still be paying CCP for the privilege.
---
OP is low moral
---
Saucy Swag then ceo and most the active pvpers left to go back to FW as being a legacy pet was an unattractive option.
---
Think the split was amicable, but gutted the corp.
---
Can Confirm, he's neck deep in the hive.
---
Qia has always been one of the nicest, most genuine people I've ever met in this game. Was glad to see her name pop back up and know that she's still playing. Also, good luck out there random HS structure basher. Fighting the citadel spam one structure at a time :)
---
God damn it.
---
A thread about a goon fuck clearly brigaging votes for more goons complaining how hard it is to log in extra accounts.
---
Voting against A goon for CSM is like voting for a republican in California. 
---
Might as well go fuck yourself. As it is a better use of your time.
---
&gt;  If TEST would not have fed carriers in the end, ISK war would have been pretty even (fort was dead when the carriers hit grid), one TEST dread also thought it was a Carrier, and jumped into the fray with Anti-Capital guns and died not applying.
---
uhhh you lost 126 HACs to 34 lol
---
Stratop FC lol https://zkillboard.com/character/95391445/
---
Damn right! Crucies are waaaaay under appreciated in wh space. Hard to hit anything when you can't track shit.
---
Absolutely agree with this. We even had a chance previously where we had to evemail ccp our chosen faction. We chose serpentis as allies and nothing ever came of it. EVE should have the capability to assist pirate/opposing factions, long live Triglav!
---
“Wildlife preserve” lmao
---
Con Cord
---
Blobbing is a very safe to do and the only real way to access the "end game" (Titans and supers). You're going to have a lot of trouble keeping your titan/super pilot safe in small-medium sized corporations. If you're at that stage of the game, you'd be crazy not joining the corps that can protect your multiple billions of ISK investment (there's no real endgame in Eve though, discussion for another day).
---
Bigger corporations usually have the best advertising (everybody knows Horde or Goons), so a lot of players go through them simply because they were first. Some end up staying with the corp because they enjoy the gameplay they find there.
---
Eve Online's advertising has really pushed the "1000v1000 fights that destroy x0000$'s worth of spaceships", so a lot of players are attracted to this kind of gameplay by eve's marketing. It's not really possible to have these big fights when you're not part of a blob, fighting another blob.
---
Some players really like the ISK accumulation game and blobbing up in null is the safest place to accumulate isk. Not my cup of tea (and, by the looks of it, not yours either), but some people like this type of gameplay.
---
My advice to you is to look at 2 areas of Eve if you want to give Eve a last shot:
---
1. Go to Low Sec and do some Faction Warfare/other lowsec pvp. You'll find "fair" pvp (people actually go in T1 frigates and fight mostly solo, although you are going to encounter faction and pirate frigates as well) and a more dangerous area of space. There's both solo/small gang pvp where player skill matters (if you just f1 and orbit, you'll probably lose) as well as fleet pvp, where even a new player like you can have an impact by tackling fleets.
---
2. Go to a Wormhole corporation. Finding a corp that accepts new players is a bit harder since experiencing the whole wormhole experience is pretty skill intensive. Exploration is probably the best way you can make ISK as a new player (although this is also true in nullsec). You'll be able to hunt others in null or wormholes, do small gang roams (usually in null) and have fleet battles with other wormhole corps. You can always do wormhole exploration + living in another area of space (called daytripping). Wormhole space is the most unsafe space in Eve, since you never know who's in the same system as you and there's no asset safety.
---
That is just their loss board...
---
From my perspective   i like the null life    we hold a few systems    and we have fun we hold our own sov a dream for most of us came true  never had more fun in eve then since we hold our own     
---
More of nullsec should be like this   smaller alliances holding sov  making it a bit more interesting instead of 4 or 5 big blocs that barelly go to war with each other
---
So, the common retort is to “bring friends” to do your salvaging.
---
That sound very interesting tbh, however I’m not very informed on the other two times..
---
&gt; 1: How do you go about choosing a system to run missions in or do you just open up the agency window and go to where it tells you?
---
IIRC you should look for a cluster of systems where there are L2-4 agents *and* a storyline agent of the same corp within a couple of jumps. Otherwise your storyline missions will be assigned to an agent from some rando corp in the faction and you miss a big boost to your standings with the corp you're running for.
---
Unbounded capsuleer greed is an endless source of content
---
Actually the conversation was like:
---
What the fuck are we going to do with this trash? 
---
Fuck it lets rent it out until somebody makes us stop.
---
I wish it was more complex or there was more thought put into it than that but there really wasn't.
---
But... not many corps will touch alpha players because.
---
1 Fear of spies
---
2 Not being able to use a cloak.
---
3 Sub par scanning skills.
---
4 You can’t do PI (which is ironic because it can pay for your account). 
---
5 once you start maximizing your mass you gotta start bringing better skilled players. Idk if alphas have the SP to survive being primary in a wormhole armor gang fleet with slaves. They’re not going to have much fun IMO.
---
Let me tell you a story about an alpha buzzard that ran into my data site while doing it in a paladin.
---
Freaked out and jumped into static and warped to the sun ( cause no cloak)
---
He was dead before he could scan his way out.
---
If alphas really wanted to I’m sure someone not competent will pick them up (Not a bad way to get into wormholes). But there is a possibility of getting ripped off by shady corps. Idk. I really recommend the omega. It’s payable with in game isk if you maximize the PI on your account.
---
I waited for the galaxy pack to go on sale and used the MCT to train up my alts with [wingspanTT’s 20 day PI skillpoint plan.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2pq2kd/quick_20day_training_plan_for_planetary/?utm_source=BD&amp;utm_medium=Search&amp;utm_name=Bing&amp;utm_content=PSR1)
---
If I were a low SP alpha dying to get into J-Space I would base out of a dead ass lowsec and scan down systems with pathfinder tracking them. With a focus on learning the system effects and lower tier sites.
---
A gilla should be able to clear most gAs sites (except instrumentals and vitals). 
---
Idk if you can use a confessor but that’s another okay way to make your first plex. Confessors in C13s. 
---
Idk. Glhf though and check out spoopy newbies.
---
Looks like you’re having trouble with reality based posting here.
---
Ha, for sure.  We're usually in frigates and VNIs that fight back could actually be pretty tricky!  My group is reasonably competent, but we could easily lose to a small group that wants to fight back. /shrug
---
You can do better than a completely unique string that will appear only where you are investigating and nowhere else?
---
They just fly EWAR frigates and stay at 100km. You need a new player wormhole group though, since they have less risk.
---
Here you go:  [https://www.amazon.com/s?k=keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=keyboard)

Would be cool to maybe interview some FCs of current wars or maybe even some NPSI groups.
---
It will be donated to the Army of Mangoes chinese group :^)
---
Eve has a RADIO STATION? Why was I not informed of this before now??? 😂
---
Can confirm, from personal experience, that never leaving the first group you join is the best way to play Eve.
---
And wearing a Trig jumpsuit/coat.
---
Send me names I'll contact them :)
---
There is an in game channel under media too
---
Easy fix. Add major empire faction fleets that fight the trigs. Increase trig faction standing and decrease empire standing upon destruction of empire vessels in the invasion areas.
---
LP vendor can be located in a triglavian controlled system.
---
The framework for all of this is already in game, including NPC's fighting eachother
---
Hostile entities call people who are aligned with goonswarm goons to needle at egos and pride. It is just low effort troll.

---
Look, we have more than one FC in test, and a worst TZ flashform strat is not that bad to learn. We achieved the goal (killed the fort that wanted to anchor). But congrats on killing 3 Fleets with very little intercommunication.
---
Sounds like I have a new distraction lmao
---
"doesn't count we're shit"
---
Sound good hopefully catch you online sometime. Be sure to share with copies
---
Seems like it would have been more expedient to let TEST or CO2 stay there, then. :shrug:
---
You guys should really be in C5’s my dude. 
---
The difference between C5’s and C4’s is the same as the difference between C4’s and 0.0
---
- You can roll chains in a single pass of a small capital.
---
- the C5 highway is real. You can ride it anywhere in eve. C5’s with a C5 static is the most common wormhole in eve. 
---
- Amarr and systems 1 jump out of Jita will roll into you from time to time
---
- more content would roll into you (I often don’t even bother scanning C4’).
---
- You don’t find as many capitals as you’d think. And I’ve killed enough capitals in C4’s to know your members will either eventually want one, or meet some. So you might as well fight them normally. (Odds are they’re doing sites) EZ Kills.
---
Here we caught an occator in a C4 by some fuckboy who was so certain we couldn’t kill his Three thannys in a C4 because MUHHHH MASSSS. We shrecked him pretty hard. Small gangs can easily kill capitals. It’s just that with so many things in eve. Once people’s perceptions changed to believe something like Hard Knocks is the big bad boogyman and unkillable, people will literally not respond to those pings. 
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/31001663/201810130500/ (Granted Mark is probably the best eve player of all time, but the theory can work)
---
Same thing with capitals. They have an aura of invincibility. But in wormholes. Theres no where to run BOIIII.
---
- fighting capitals that warped in on a friendly rorqual was some of the funnest fighting I’ve ever had in my life. You see. Capitals can’t be Cyno’ed into a wormhole. But they can be warped around and built in there (no supers, no titans). And you can realistically only field 3 (which means massive sub capital support fleets which can actually kill capital class ships with ease. The MEME is a C4 CEO not wanting to fight capitals so they choose a C4 because no evictions. But ppl evict with Leshaks and idk. You’re really selling yourself short. Also nobody is going to see you if you give good fights. Yet ppl like holesale will have capitals built in their home azabel if they really wanted to be evicted so don’t let capitals keep you away from the promised land.
---
- And sites go from 100mil each that take about an hour in battleships to 1bil+ solo in a dread. And up to 4Bil if you have 4 dreads 3 one cycling the site and 1 doing the drifter. I’m pretty sure from the looks of it your doods would be able to do this day 0. 
---
But glad you’re in wormholes at least. Highly recommend C5 space.

1: How do you go about choosing a system to  run missions in or do you just open up the agency window and go to where  it tells you?

First things first , you choose the Corp you want to run missions for. The LP is what you need to look at specifically since they are not universally the same this the larger difference being the implants offered the gunner/missile implants being from the combat oriented Corps and the Manufacturing/Research/Refine being from the others. There is another thing to consider about selection and that are Corporations that have Research Agents ( Though they're usefulness has been toned down quite a bit ) 
---
2: Is there a "best" faction to run missions for?
---
Faction isn't "Needed" for running missions ( Of course you don't want standings so low they shoot you). While faction standings can be used in place of agent/corp standings , with connections 5 its a trivial matter. You would have to look at supply of LP products , the current volume sold and price per LP to get a sence of "The Best" but these trends go up and down all the time.
---
3: Does the system security level affect the mission payout? (lower the better)
---
Yes a .5 gives more rewards than a .7 but you want to make sure the .5 isn't going to send you into low sec , tends to be a death sentence. Skills probably provide more reward than sec status so start with them ( security connections/connections insert other ones i can't remember)
---
There is another thing to remember as well , you would have to use dotlan but you may wish to make sure the corp you are working for is also going to have a "generic storyline agent lvl 1 " in the same system . Its the missions that gives the faction boost as well as a VERY large boost in corp standings but you only get a mission  after 16 missions of the same lvl for the same faction

"Proceed to grind some ihubs in 10% tidi and ask yourself: "
---
Um, new player?   Titans don't grind ihubs anymore, not for a long time.   Now they do sanctums.    (Or stay docked if you are in NC.dock)
---
I really wanted to vote for you Dunk but the pineapple pizza.... Yuk.
---
Lol, no
---
I just want to play, wtf is going on :(
---
TEST lived in Vale, nobody made them leave, i told progod we were moving into tribute and he went "fuck no" and they moved.
---
I think we both know Co2 had to go under the bus so we could get to you.
---
all i did was point out the irony that CCP is so bad that the bad thing they put in was so poorly executed that it wasn't that bad, relax kiddo
---
There are plenty of alliances in pure blind holding their own against bad man ~~snuff~~ ~~init~~ (who really knows anymore?) Fedup should have reached out before bailing to test.
---
the amount of shit you've misread about the situation in the drone regions is staggering
---
but i applaud your passion
---
Doh
---
Nice. I rolled with you for a bit yesterday and added you to my friend list. I may jump back on and reship tonight to dork around if your on.
---
TEST sub fleet was like 60 People. What else would you call a light fleet vs 200 Muninns? 5 Bombers? The XIX Eagles were a bit preoccupied with getting the fort down so it was rarely all Eagles vs all Muninns, more like Muninns vs one of the two eagle fleets. I must give it to Elo that he also outmaneuvered us quite a bit.
---
i'm not bitching. i'm just pointing out that ccp have consistently introduced things that were crap and promptly abandoned them - and there's exactly no reason to expect this to be any different.
---
no blobs this time....get rekt...see what happens with barely even numbers? :o
---
Cant believe you took the time to write that up, let alone think it!
---
Will you be my daddy ?
---
Implying that NC. will be able to form 1000 dudes next year...
---
did you mean to post twice?
---
i only ask because it seems like you misspelled your alliance name and might be prone to making simple mistakes like that
---
What did you destroy now, Richy?
---
I think you're talking about high class there mostly, few C4 fights mass out any of the connections (and adding low skilled pilots in ewar or tackle frigates, or even combat cruisers, won't affect that much).
---
Not having cloaking is a pretty big deal though.
---
You have no idea what you are talking about. I argued vociferously on behalf of the WHers to get that fixed. 
---
This is the biggest problem with you, Olmeca, and it has been for as long as I have k own you. You do not actually read what anybody else says because you are too busy arguing your own views to take theirs into account. Nowhere have I ever told WHers their play style was invalid because it was emergent and CCP didn’t expect it.
---
This is yet another example of you putting words in my mouth and making bullshit assumptions because you don’t like somebody. It’s stupid. Don’t do it. 
---
I was the one guy advocating for the WHers while other CSM members were openly saying “fuck WHers” and all I get is fried for trying to help.
---
I didnt make the alliance  so i didnt do it
---
At least we play ;)
---
That swag has my name on it.
---
triggered much? =P
---
Let's be honest.  Is there anyone that thought this would go anywhere after the drifter incursion fiasco?
---
I'm glad it worked out for you. =)
---
It's a lot harder to do when you don't want to be in a big null alliance. It turns into a major handicap.
---
I would consider this a feature and not a bug.  
---
Congratulations by the way, how will you spend your new free time?
---
If Co2 were still there, you’d at least have some fights.
---
Not since they turned that to criminal act along with repping people in war.
---
Well we moved to C4 with C3/C5 statics after the C1/C3 sucked for content and are loving the C5 highways without capitals follow us home when we go for subcap fights xD
---
Imo we're just not there yet, we're growing though. One day... For now we're having fun, when we're not having fun we'll switch it up.
---
That side by side alignment got me good. [Friendship is best ship](https://youtu.be/hX8bFu0UxQw?t=288)
---
wasn't aware suitonia's stream was ccp's official way to communicate with the community
---
I've tried both. I guess my office must have something preventing me from streaming this.
---
oh fuck no did she take his phone and tablet to....last time she did i pissed my pants when he told that
---
I meant CO2 after we'd fled the north. [The whole keepstar thing, etc.](https://imperium.news/assault-m-oee8-keepstar/) Date on that is Dec. 4th, 2016. Curiously, after that, on the 18th of December, [TEST announces they are leaving.](https://imperium.news/test-leaves-vale/) The events seem likely to related, no?
---
I mean, I'd accept that impulsiveness over what I think was the first keepstar loss in Eve drove the decision, but it's a little less cut and dried than "lol what else can we do."
---
I feel like this is some sort of new EVE Scam.... does this make me a bitter vet?
---
Do you get insurance payout for delivered ships?
---
If you can get tuned in you can get it on there
---
The only surprising thing is that people are surprised that CCP fails spectacularly at everything.  I mean, when are you guys going to learn?  Proof is in the pudding.
---
I honestly think people thought we put way more planning into shit than we did.
---
Yeah, I ain't trying to imply there was some nefarious master all according to the bbq plan or anything. If anything, I was trying to play up how frivolous the decision probably was.
---
Steve, Dunk, Olmeca... we got some great options this year for the GSM!
---
&gt; You do not actually read what anybody else says 
---
I literally saw what you said while reading others criticizing you for the same thing. I wasn't there as you folks run the CSM discord in a way that allows toxic nullsec edge lords masterfully metagame to suppress other voices.
---
&gt; I argued vociferously on behalf of the WHers. I was the one guy advocating for the WHers while other CSM members were openly saying “fuck WHers” and all I get is fried for trying to help.
---
What you did after wormholer rage already gained traction doesn't matter. I agree that you're the kind of person who listens and adjusts beliefs accordingly, and does a better job in actually spending time absorbing feedback from people compared to other empire builder CSMs. The breaking point for me was not what you did. It was your very bringing up of CCP intentions like they matter in a discussion of maintaining an emergent playstyle. That shows a mentality that you weren't willing to protect valuable playstyles unless it's your own, and would find absurd points to justify your unwillingness. 
---
What matters as much as the ability to listen in a CSM are those first reactions to things, the expertise, the mentality. After all the playerbase won't be there to give you feedback and tell you what's right on most important issues about this game. Particularly upcoming things under NDA. Those are the times in which it actually shows whether you can represent a playstyle. That's why I was always skeptical about a null linemember claiming ability to represent everyone, even those whose interests clash with his.  
---
 At the end of the day you did nothing to address many of the issues wormholers experience. I'm skeptical whether you can even list top items in their agenda after doing more than a year as a CSM. Let alone being able to come up smart, unthought ways to solve their issues yourself. Because you're so far away from that playstyle. That's not your fault, but you can't talk as if you can represent them.
---
&gt; This is yet another example of you putting words in my mouth and making bullshit assumptions because you don’t like somebody. It’s stupid. Don’t do it.
---
What words did I put in your mouth? You said you'd represent everyone. You said the thing I quote from the CSM Discord. I didn't claim any other words coming to be from your mouth. I made other claims like you didn't represent these people.
---
&gt; you don’t like somebody.
---
Wouldn't say that. I'd absolutely have a beer with you. You've just been wrong in many of your claims on issues regarding CSM, and our arguments always emerged from those. I like to defend what I believe to be true, particularly on issues related to this game which I love. Don't confuse me arguing against your ideas as a judgment of your personality. There are people in Eve I genuinely don't like. You aren't one.
---
When I was 10kk skill point I injected on my main a carrier try to rat with it and got killed in 3 days never flown a carrier since even though I theoretically could and I'm now at 55kk

Me, every patchday, while staring at the launcher.
---
Amarr/Minmitar is currently a good place to look for content, though I don't know what the levels are. Caldari recently hit lvl 5 however. Yes, precursor ships are a small gang staple now, particularly the kikimora and drekavak. They aren't as dominant as solo ships, but you still see them fairly often.
---
That article is 5 years old btw
---
Was waiting for this lol sup mp
---
1. Everyone, it gives you a suspect flag
---
2. Ninja-salvaging doesn't give any flags
---
3. Nothing, shooting them makes you a valid target to them but no one else. This is a limited-engagement flag
---
4. Yes, -10 have a permanent criminal flag, and are always valid targets
---
5. Yes
---
As a rule, anyone flashy is a valid target assuming you are using either the default overview or one of the common overview packs. When in doubt you can also just leave your safety on green and never risk going suspect.
---
if you run a fleet, surely you can find a dedicated salvager in a tanked noctis? 
---
salvage mechanic is actually brilliant in my opinion
---
I wish we had :/
---
That’s a pretty good mentality. I’m still planning out what I’m tryna do.
---
Ninja salvaging has always been a thing
---
I totally agree and wholeheartedly respect newbie wormhole corps.
---
Sounds fun, but remember to be patient. Unless you are joining a smaller/newer group, it will take a long time to get into a leadership position where you are trusted with significant assets or decisions. A year is usually the minimum. A good place to start is learning to be an FC or volunteering to help with logistics.

So you've played the game 3 months and you already know everything there is to know. Impressive. How can I be smart like you? You avoided goons because you wanted to make a difference, so you joined horde. Lmao.

That's up to you. There are still areas of the game to find enjoyment in. Have you ever considered WH space?

I need that blob emoji on the right please thx

you're not wrong

Hello suspecting bittervet 32471
---
Thanks for your responses! I didn't realize that looting from a wreck turned me suspect to everyone... I'll have to be a bit more careful. :D
---
&gt; Ninja-salvaging doesn't give any flags
---
This seems like a really strange choice to me on CCPs part, but maybe there's some nuance here I'm missing. It's effectively stealing from a loot can, or in the case of the Triglavians it's actually worse as the value is primarily in the salvage for most of the ships. I'd much rather be able to grant someone 'salvage rights' or have personal rights expire after 15 minutes or something to free up the cleanup crews. Ah well.
---
I was sold when you had the three shots

It is tired but let’s face it, we are tuh baddies.

Sure let me just open up all 5 accounts and do that 15 times.

Concord was a mistake.
---
Goals. Make some and get to it xD 
---
Eve is a sandbox in which you don't get led by your nose, there are doors you can open but ultimately it is up to you to create your own fun. With 3 players all around the same skill level you guys should be able to do something to work towards a goal, be it big or small.
---
This is a really stupid question since I’m asking some of the most dedicated players. But here I go, is Eve worth starting in 2019? I’m a complete newbie, I literally just finished downloading it and I’ve heard about it for years and always thought it looked fun.
---
Bonus question, any tips for a newbie?
---
Why the hell didn't they do that? That would have been amazing
---
What we have right now are just scouts... We will be seeing the real "fuck you" card in a couple weeks, when their dreadnoughts start going after our stations LOL
---
This is funny
---
I don't know everything and I'm asking for constructive advice and opinion. However Eve is not a rocket science.
---
I’m not doom moron
---
o7
---
old mean, but checks out
---
"world ark"... That does sound like something murderous!
---
Why did they actually have a lot of CTAs vs. strat ops vs. regular ops?  Test has barely had any CTAs since FEDUP joined legacy.  If Test doesn't think its critical, calling it a CTA vs. strat op won't matter at all for smaller legacy alliances.
---
they are gallente faction war, right?  and hasn't caldari recently taken ovre the warzone?  gallante LP price spike, time to cash in then refarm.
---
I honestly don't know what titans doing these days. By looking at killboard and reddit  it appears  that they are mostly staying docked and occasionally waiting for wonder in the groups of 1000+ titans.
---
I’m wondering why you had to write it so suddenly if everything is happy days between AIDER and FedUp leadership?
---
Are you running for CSM?
---
I sure am!
---
does it work now
---
And then fucking fired him and proceeded to ruin the entire in-game economy worse than Mugabe
---
Are you aware that you are talking about highsec players? If you force them into PVP, most of them will stay docked. If they wanted to PVP, they wouldnt be in highsec.
---
The killboards are not maintained by CCP, anything having to do with, or exploitable of them is in the hands of third parties.
---
I am working now, will be able to test it in 7 hours
---
Don’t you know? [He works closely with the Mittani](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/83y3s4/do_you_know_who_i_am_matterall_special/)
---
wat
---
I dont want to be free, i dont want to win eve, i really want to keep losing lol
---
CPP doesn’t care because killboards are not part of the game, I almost think they should cut killmail out of the API and end them.
---
That's what doom would say.
---
Honestly, I have no idea as to the reason behind it. About the only disadvantage to it is that you can't gather yellow wrecks with tractors.
---
Imagine if EVE was sandbox enough that once you have a high enough standings (let's say 10.0 with faction) you can join their capsuleer corporation.
---
Literally the majority of the playerbase when it's in their favour to talk about killboards.
---
Fuck sake I’m working (
---
Just remember, if you are listening when they go null sec and hot drop them they get really really mad. Sorry about the bombing in Providence all those years ago....
---
This is so well-put - every small fight is different, and reading and responding to the different situations is just endlessly fun.
---
This is true
---
Mehtterall
---
Do you even need to kill it? Cant you just unanchor it?
---
&gt; didn't ask anything of value
---
I'd say that's exactly Eve's politics. We need someone to break the wheel though.
---
Nah, you can train into a decently-fit and cheap AF or t2 ewar frig in a couple of weeks, and be more-than-occasionally useful in almost any small gang.
---
Insert "Hans? Are we the bad guys?" Meme here.
---
The CSM was, is, and always will be retarded.
---
Good ‘ol Qiwi. There’s a reason we call her Space Mom.
---
Sounds like they are giving the engine a spray with some start ya bastard.
---
&gt; subscribe buttons
---
Subscribed users already have this button in the launcher, it's only a small step to included it in the client.
---
They claimed he never existed.. just like the 2 men that weren't arrested in military gear outside of Sandy Hook that was broadcast live...
---
New player here. Is there any tool that allows you to view the statics in a wormhole system without having to actually wait to find them yourself?
---
&gt; customer service/satisfaction fields
---
There isn't a field though, it's just a thumbs up or down. CCP have to extrapolate from what the user was doing if they enjoyed it or not. 
---
How is CCP supposed to know my experience was lessened because I had to close and re-open industry three times for it to function correctly when I also had an unexpected delay from selecting my character to the client actually beginning loading it while not having any information windows display the information unless I opened it twice.
---
Any mapping tool will do, like Pathfinder.
---
Killing an expensive Garmur in a cheap T1 always feels wonderful
---
Yay more lowsec people
---
I guess leaving FW temporarily was a ruse then.
---
Thanks :) I try to be thoughtful in my responses.
---
All nullblocs, sorry. Goonswarm is primarily made up of children that go to school, which is why there's literally always a war that starts (not so coincidentally) in late May/early June. I'll go ahead and say at max the "War" in Tribute will last 2 months and everyone on both sides will go back to their turbokrab-infested homes and nothing will happen. Even goons losing all of their sov during WWB didn't stop them from returning to turbokrabbing as soon as the war ended. All anyone in this game does (myself included) is Turbokrab and whelp expensive shit. None of the conflict has any real meaning. Goons have invented a reason to invade Tribute not because there's a real rivalry but because they're bored. And when they get tired of free structure kills and massive blueballs they'll leave. Just like anyone who attacks goon space does. Pretending goons and panfam are fundamentally different on a basic level is laughable at best.
---
&gt; Would be cool to maybe interview some FCs of current wars 
---
This for sure! Go to Zkillboard, find anything from 400 pilot battles to 6 pilot skirmishes. Then reach out to the Alliance/Corp on the killboard to find the FC. Ask them talk about the fight, how it began, how they learned from past fights ect.
---
Not only would this be educational and entertaining, it would also provide exposure to FC's! More pilots wanting to fly with them. More pilots wanting to fight against them. Eitherway, a more involved community.
---
I think you Dunk'd yourself with your stance on pineapple pizza. Not that I personally have a horse in that race, because I'm an equal-opportunity pizza-topping consumer, but cutting out some swathe of potential voters who are fervent on their choice of pizza toppings might've been a Hillary-level misstep.
---
make friends in eve, and eve is the best game to play. And it's not hard to make friends. Hence eve is still worth playing.
---
I wish EVE Radio was more well advertised :) I feel like newer players aren't well aware of it. I love it, used to listen to it all the time. Less often lately but I still tune in once in a while and it's fantastic.
---
Is there an in-game channel or a discord for it?
---
Westlife?!?! Really? What the fuck!
---
I'm not! XD
---
I liked the idea of EVE but playing it wasn't much fun. Needs better PvE I think. Ratting is just mining where the asteroids shoot back, but there's almost no danger. The PvP could use something to shake it up, too. Maybe something like Super Wormholes that open for a month to temporary territory that the mega corps have to rush in and claim like fresh territory, and get out before they go away forever until a fresh Super Wormhole space opens up with new stellar terrain.
---
I've got some other ideas for EVE improvements but I don't think any of them would be implemented even if they could make changes as big as I imagine. I'd probably have to make my own EVE instead, with blackjack and hookers. Probably not even kidding. EVE needs minigames to do when you're stuck in a station or waiting on someone. XD
---
Nice ASCII art. A++++++. Would view again.

Pineapple pizza is great. But I won’t hold it against you because everyone has the right to be wrong.

You are a fine man dunk, you have my vote
---
I disagree; it's current format makes it accessible. Incursion rats blap you if you don't do it properly

If you ever wonder why CCPers seem to have ships in every major wormholer's home that gets evicted, this is why.
---
JUST
---
dont worry i was swiftly removed
---
Even though I don't support the CSM, putting the voting function on the main page is a good idea. However, I don't support ballot box stuffing. 1 vote per person is the better path.
---
fuckin /u/eonan
---
The smaller legacy guys want to make sure the bigger legacy guys respect their contributions so they ratchet up the significance of every raitaru bash.  They then beat it into members that attendance is mandatory, etc.  to the point of threatening expulsion for failing to log in and fleet up.  
---
Also there’s plenty of comparison against alliances they perceive to be of lesser quality (Brave is a constant target).  Alliance meetings held where military directors say shit like “if we continue to be outformed by Brave we’re gonna be changing the required #s” and just generally being low class and disparaging to alliance members.  “Brave is trash...”.  Even tho in impass and catch I’m not sure how many non-Brave rorqual and super saves are made on brave coms with Brave FCs and Brave pilots.   
---
The shit show that is legacy and is documented here with Fedup with regard to inconsistent treatment of members is not unique to one specific alliance.  Brave May be an exception but they’re detrimentally afk at the top that they’re losing solid corps lately.
---
Old
---
"thats how the game goes?!" we backed you all up in the north, then you turn coat and sell the enemy your remaining CR structures, leaving your allies royally screwed. Then, months later, when we just happen to roam in your area, we are demonized and called traitors. FYI only deal we made was to leave our CR constellation in defeat. Then FEDUP goes on a month long tirade hitting our fountain space, with no success. Sure we got a bunch of good content out of it, but that just goes to show anyone is better off against FEDUP rather that with them. good riddance. least the silver/american picker memes were highly enjoyable thx to clam.
---
&gt;it seems only fair...
---
Since when has eve been "fair"?
---
Min/amarr had content everyday of the week. From frig fleets up to supers
---
The main reason, I play for the addrenaline rush.
---
5 years now.
---
Small gang pvp. Forgot everithing else, just too boring imo.
---
Practically one shot in most fits
---
I've unsubbed 2 month ago, and never looked back since. My playstyle is dead and no horizons of it comming back, sadly. Now, it feel like its either join a Mega-Alliance and be a F1 Monkeys or krap until you can fly cap for mega-fight...... to get blueballed. Not for me anymore. Rust is the new "adrenaline dealer" Addicted since i've tried it.
---
Was Dr Eyjo Guodmundsson.  We loved his Econ reports.
---
Take my upvote
---
You attacked us in our space in that roam. If we did a few missions in your space in response, well you don’t have much to complain about. I don’t remember such incursions happening and I definitely wasn’t there if they did, but I’ll take your word for it. 
---
Ditching y’all and selling structures to our enemies... that’s a more salient point.
---
I bet he did come back to you

Since wormholes are still crying about local in null sec when can we remove wormholes from the game?
---
I hope they stay around, even if it is in name only. Call me sentimental but a history like that should not just fade away.
---
Tldr: Local 😭😭😭😭😭
---
well if you let me know you had multiple accounts then i would have also mentioned the tool too copy in game settings between accounts in the launcher (it's the "client settings" option btw).
---
I guess it's easier to just get on with the hating tho.
---
This isnt new. Look at Doomchinchilla loses lol. https://zkillboard.com/character/578639263/losses/
---
actually no, this issue surfaced like after 2 years and "he" was no longer working
---
It was simple bulk data validation files from various systems, like 700k rows on a weekly basis
---
Goons confirmed juggalos.
---
Whew, if what you said is true, that sounds a bit toxic.  At least to the average test member, it doesn't matter if one alliance forms 17 and the other 20.  Just try to be there when you can, but don't fall over backwards for it.  We get stuff happens.  We are just happy when we see a support fleet.  Brave is generally considered a low-skilled blob - but big.  Getting outformed by them should be common.
---
he's not bitter tho..
---
Hahaha.

Interesting. How do you propose to balance cloaking should your changes take effect?

ffs, who's cutting onions ;.;

Yeah because EVE is such a deep simulationist spaceship game, right? You can just close your own chat windows if you wanna, it's pretty unfair of you to be able to just magically know who else is in system with you, yeah?

opening the fleet finder window does not generate a session change timer. showing info on a character or item does not generate a session change timer. no response from the client when you pick a character at the character screen is not a session change timer.

Probably find it was requested by a listener

Today I learned that Abyssal Invaders are the night King equivalent in Eve online.
---
Praise Bob my dudes! Let's hope we meet! :)
---
It costs a price to be vegan and special.
---
Autothysian lancers aint so bad, or atleast not always.
---
I engaged 3 of those with rattlesnake, when i didnt know anything about them. 
---
They did lots of damage, but i managed to kill them, pretty easily. 
---
Someone told me later that they can also call backup..
---
Has someone tried to shoot these trig scouts?
---
So most of the YouTube comments are about the perceived attendance of this event. Certainly in the first few shots, it doesn't look like there are a lot of people there. Can anyone comment on the actual number of attendees? How did it compare versus previous years?
---
Former requiem member.  Can confirm.  Listening to the leaders Brave is shit.   I was disgusted.  I like Brave and their dudes.  They form big for rorqual saves and Generally have a more active line members.
---
Praise Bob!
---
Have you played eve? What makes you think I want to talk to someone in their moms basement and he interrupts our talk to yell at his mom to make more pizza  bites?
---
He stayed there with me until the cluster shut down for the night, I wonder where his adventures will take him?
---
On one of my trips back I brought a remote shield booster to give him my thanks for keeping me company.
---
Have you verified the shared cache? This helps in all kinds of situations.
---
&gt;If the invasion of the Triglavian Collective on Pilots of New Eden is not a good enough reason
---
What invasion lol?
---
Or better yet. Add local to wormholes
---
….in Jita
---
During an invasion though, the police would be repressed. I think the above thread is mainly about the fact that even under military occupation CONCORD will skip on over to pop your ship.
---
So you think that war should be consensual?
---
next Sharkweek when?
---

---
Bad bait is bad
---
I'd be nice if the OP would follow his own advise: stop typing.
---
I dual box t3s darks in a pair of t2 fit hawks. I loose them every so often but, they are less than 60mil each.
---
FW is mostly frigate/destroyer stuff. If you have a 50+ mil sp character it's kinda waste of hard earned skillpoints to buzz around in frigs eternally.
---
If you would mostly get system occupancy from large plexes it might change. But most of the folks in FW just want to keep flying their frigs, so...
---
short answer. absolutely yes.
---
tips for new players. #1 join a corp! friends are your greatest resource in this game.
---
\#2 right click everything. 
---
that should hopefully get you pointed in the right direction.
---
Ya, here in Test we kind of like Brave.  They will run smack into the wall, then get up and try again.   Spam low-skill ships at times, just feed numbers to stop the enemy.  Their spirit in defending Catch early on impressed us.
---
What catches the eye of the regular test guy isn't the regular strat ops, its when you manage opsec status on something due to your size and regular frat spies don't catch it - like dread bombing a ratting super or some rorquals.
---
Clicked link, can confirm eve does not have a radio station.
---
We won
---
I don't think requiem eternal is in any position to look down on any alliance. Even Brothers of Tangra, a half man, half bot, half alt alliance does better at protecting their space and fighting on their own than Requiem ever has or will.
---
Wtf are you on about?
---
You're pathetic.
---
Yeah so go join test and fly harpies lol
---
What is with the Majorana Heavy Missile? Do the invasion ships drop those as loot?
---

One on the greats in EVE.  Glad to be able to fly with this guy.  Has my vote.

And that's from someone with a sev3rance flair
---
&gt;Since we've satisfied every edgelord f1 pilot in nullsec with cyno jammed pocketed system that say highsec is too easy with Trig invasions.
---
Did you have a stroke typing this?
---
I agree with you on the "unselect all"-button, we definitely need that one.
---
That's what I see when doing them.
---
If your drones are in range and they haven't targeted you yet they go for the drones.
---
They didn't do this before and of course there's nothing in the patch notes to suggest they've changed anything but clearly they have.
---
Anyone claiming they haven't noticed a change must do abyssals in a very strange way, I noticed what was going on in the first pocket when I lost a Vespa II within about 30s of entering.

If they are truly shooting low-power structures, the Trigs need to get to Null soon 😂
---
&gt;We just need to enable the voice portion  
---
It's not a fucking checkbox mate, what are you on
---
Yep, that's why you never write stuff in your code that you don't want to risk your customers seeing.
---
If its the guy im thinking of i thought he got a job in icelands college as economics teacher.
---
I'm a social scientist you cretin
---
top kek
---
So basically you're distressed and angry because your enemies have bigger ships than you?
---
I've been out of the loop...what happened?
---
or this year
---
haha I forgot all about that dude.
---
Yeah it's hard to find the right group to join. Especially now when there are so few pvp focused groups left in Eve. I remember back in circa 2013 when there were hundreds of different options to choose from for every taste :(
---
Lol what is this post
---
What watch are so wearing
---
From what I remember, WANGS was whoring or something during a SNUFF fight and there was, in my opinion, an overreaction on the part of FEDUP leadership. We ended up fighting WANGS, people I consider friends and allies, in cloud ring right as the jump bridge changes hit in our old space while fighting SNUFF in our new Pure Blind space. We proceeded to lose and then run away. That's my foggy and possibly incomplete recollection.
---
ohh poor panfam
---
Pushed out, fired, left on his own, in the end it’s all the same
---
Sadly, CCP does not have the testicular mass to pull that off!
---
Also, I doubt Triglavians will go after NPC stations... What I am imagining the Triglavian incursions truly means for the game is that all those player stations left and forgotten will be blowing up in mass
---
Try Imperium vs Panfam... Since the war is not only Goons vs NC?
---
Because you talk in the mirror all the time?
---
Starting my personal protest to remove all drone bays from all non-gallente or gallente hybrid ships!
---
I suggest adding mobile apps to third-party apps.
---
You can find a list on [awesome Eve's github](https://github.com/devfleet/awesome-eve#mobile-applications).
---
Your memory is flawed. I never claimed what you say I said and I have only repeated what was said by CCP on that issue. I challenge you to prove otherwise. 
---
What I did the minute I saw the blog was start to advocate for a fix and I kept it up every day for a week until we got one. I worked with the WH community to try and find a workaround if they didn’t fix it, but kept pushing internally to get it fixed. Again, you have no idea what you’re talking about, and you’re just repeating shit you’ve heard from other people who don’t have the whole story because they weren’t there. 
---
You can read the minutes if you want to know what I brought up. I was one of the only ones bringing stuff up and gave the Devs a whole pile of concerns the WHers asked me to bring. 
---
You argue against anything that doesn’t align with what you think, and even when I did agree with thins you said you still argued with me because you can’t stop arguing and making assumptions about what other people think instead of reading what they actually say. I can’t believe that the one thing you seem to remember is something I never argued.
---
&gt; current chat system is ran on Skype for busines

Remember to properly secure and/or biomass your alts ppl. This is how we get sleepers and drifters people
---
Someone is always trying to silence my truth.
---
Brand New Bros in test has been a fun Corp. Nightly small gang roams into frat space killing whatever we can find, usually a few bil a night from ratters, freighters, or the small gangs that try to fight us. Test Goku fleets are a blast. 
---
Maybe try out a smaller Corp and start making friends while you learn to pvp.
---
increase max havens in system
---
Lol they mention lotro...
---
Amarr/Minmitar FW space is decent. You can also try Horde space, the locals like to give semi-fair fights, though it may not be solo (also ram jags for days).
---
Vanity is a powerful vice.
---
They can't even keep im&amp;p straight, you think they can handle voice? Over multi-continent uncontrolled WAN links? Gtfo
---
&gt; why most players blob?
---
Having more players makes up for people not being good.
---
maybe you woke up in an alternate reality where you just suck at the game

I need to be sure about what really matters before I cast a vote.
---
I am a Wormhole industrialist/miner. I live with danger. My space is high risj, high reward. I have a good set of friends, with some mutual dislike. Gas huffing, pvp escalations, and being in the unknown are what drive me to play. I suck at pvp, but I can damn well try. Wormhole combat is a strategic tug of war around a central entry point, with limited uses. Wormhole alliances are generally nice people, with interesting characters. We don't have titans, yet that is a good thing.
---
I play this game for the story. I love tge incredible designs, stories, and graphical artwork this game produces. I love factions, and search every corner for information regarding their forming and relationships with others. My most recent fascination is the Triglavian species. I love their concept and design, beyond that of any other faction; though they tie with the Guristas. I want to see actual development within the game universe.
---
Oh man, that reminds me of when I started playing eve, I convinced myself it was possible to mine enough to pay for the monthly sub with Plex. 3 subscription accounts and years later I realized that maybe CCP designed it so that you can't do that kind of thing, no matter how awesomely efficient your mining set up is, whether you mine the entire time your awake or not hahaha
---
so you're the fucker that ate all my crayons
---
I want that shirt.
---
I’m not playing right now. Game is mostly full of cowards who use tools in game and out to avoid all danger. Until CCP does some much needed major changes, I won’t be back. Anyone who tells you EVE is for hardcore gamers is lying. You will find more players in a match of Fortnight that take risks than you will find in the entire remaining player base of EVE Online.
---
My watch is a 1960s Omega Seamaster De Ville Automatic
---
Oh god no.
---
I love how you ignored my point
---
&gt; cry on reddit and internal forums
---
Be a bro and link me the internal forum posts so I don't have to go searching. I could use a laugh.
---
Next level would be throwing a couple dreads in there. Novac has the funds to make this happen. :P
---
&gt; I have only repeated what was said by CCP on that issue
---
With no obvious motivation other than using it as a justification for what was happening. You didn't oppose to it. You didn't criticize it. You weren't acting as a messenger. You were behind the point, using it to justify the "collateral damage".
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9glsyb/a_plea_to_any_who_will_listen_ccpls_dont_let/e6566pp/). If you don't believe wormholers haven't been represented this year, take it from Exooki, the current wormhole candidate. 
---
&gt; Finally, I just can't see this as anything except evidence of how not having a WHer in the room on CSM is hurting us pretty badly. After the elections any comments about lacking WH representation were drowned out by " itll be fine" or some CSM reps even claiming theyd represent us.
---
&gt; Clearly this was not the case, and whats even scarier is if this is what we are going to get from a small change, where they knew the WH impact and willingly ignored it, how bad are the larger decisions where they don't even understand the implications going to be?
---
I'm not saying you were maliciously misrepresenting things nor you didn't do your best to relay people's worries. In fact, there are people in those threads thanking you for working with them and that makes you superior to empire builder candidates. But I'm saying the very problems I warned you about how it's impossible for people to properly represent certain playstyles without immersing themselves in them, and how that's why we need a diverse CSM body from certain backgrounds, became true. These are highly political, philosophical disagreements between you and me. I'm not expecting to convince an American republican into the values of diversity in representational bodies in a discussion about video games. So I'll stop arguing with you now. You can take the last shot if you'd like.
---
Just bring the ammo right for your filament. 
---
If you are running elecs go EM etc.
---
This has always been one of my favorite things in Eve.
---
The only risk vs reward system
---
Lmao
---
Reminds me of the day when skill extractors had just become available. I decided to extract all the SP out of my 120+ mil SP main and a 60+ mil combat alt. You don't want to know how much ISK flowed through my wallet. I started with ten billion ISK to get the ball rolling. I ended up selling just over half of my SP from both toons to inject new toons, one with 50 mil SP and the other with 30 mil SP. Took me hours to do it all... it became its own very un-amusing mini game.   
---
And to think... I used to tell people that P.I. was an unnecessary click fest....
---
FYI: TEST does not have 15m / reddit account requirements. Dreddit does. Test is an alliance composed of many corps that do not share Dreddit's requirements, or its culture.
---
Don't be afraid of spies you're in fuckin Horde. Everyone is a spy.
---
Whats the pl mordhau server again?
---
Going to go get pineapple on my pizza just for you guys tonight.
---
‘Tis why I left them
---
CSM's have to use real names, voters need to register as well!!!  (I don't actually support this idea)
---
This entire post is why I play!
---
Lol sounds like you havent tried WH space yet! Thats where all the fun is. Fuck NS politics your missing most of the game without going into whs. Only thing you lose is supers.. Cuz who wants to fight in tidi!
---
In order to earn enough ISK to PLEX my monthly subscription by running incursions (which is some of the best, most steady ISK in the game), I'd have to put in around 22 hours per month, or 5.5 hours per week. Now, I have a real life job that uniquely offers 24/7 all-you-can-eat overtime, so in terms of time/money efficiency the idea that I would farm incursions for that many hours in exchange for what amounts to $10-$15 is absurd. That's a horrible abuse of my time. Of course, I play EVE for fun not money, but even still, I wouldn't play that many hours of incursions for my own enjoyment. I like flying logi for incursion fleets, but never that bloody much. Paying ISK for my account(s) doesn't make sense on any level.
---
Wait. Wat?  
---
In systems that Triglavian invaded, CONCORD is shut down?
---
I just remember having to defend CR sov a number of times - lots of toasting, lots of Jackdaw fleets, and lots of WANGS blue balls since we wouldn't really go toe to toe, which was to be expected when they brought Munnins with lots of logi. 
---
This whole thing is really intriguing. I left XMETA a while back because the blue donut sov thing didn't jive with me, and then stopped logging in cause I didn't find another group to click with. Maybe AIDER will take an occasionally useful ex-FEDUP F1 monkey. I loved FW the most, and I'd be seriously interested in playing again with that as a focus.
---
I went out of my way to be mad, and I'm shocked how mad I got
---
Popup ads you can't close
---
Your discord link is dead, could I get another invite link?
---
Ah the good old days...
---
and we don't even have the FMI to fuck us
---
Tbqh I don't see the issue with this... it even makes sense for them to add those in order to more accurately gauge if the playerbase is actually pissed about something or if it's just a few people making a lot of noise on reddit.
---
Well... it's not like hoboleaks would be an "official CCP-way" to distribute official information. Not the best job communicating on the CONCORD thing though, agreed to that.
---
touche
---
I've had a client phone my manager and be like "so the tool just told me to fuck off"
---
CONCORD is more akin to UN forces than a city's police force. The five empires agreed to give power to CONCORD to serve as a third party and keep the peace between the empires. When capsuleers became a thing it was natural that CONCORD would police them since capsuleers are independent of the empires.
---
When the Serpentis screw around inside Gallente space, its an internal matter for the Gallente Empire to work out. The Sansha Nation is unique in that there are two arms of it, one which is your day to day pirate force the other an existential invasion threatening every empire equally thus leading to CONCORD stepping in and recruiting eager capsuleers by way of payment for services.
---
So stop comparing CONCORD to the local police department.
---
add full local to all wh's - not a wh'er btw
---
In missions it actually tells you how to complete the mission. I haven't noticed much else YET, but maybe there will be more.
---
Thank you?
---
Shoot the wrecks lol, or would you get the Concordokken in highsec?
---
Yup that’s why I joined up with TEST.
---
I play to stop the PLification of EVE
---
I have a pizza...
---
I have pineapple...
---
*Uhh*
---
Pineapple Pizza!
---
You all need to work on your advertising strategy.
---
I remember as a new player I had no idea what EVE Radio was but I hated it already because of the sheer spam of recruitment ads to dead corps in EVE Radio alliance, just from being in local in certain highsec systems or help channels. Like 3-5 of them per hour.
---
Fweddit is pvp only
---
Killboards are pretty much essential as a historical tool, and EVE history is very much an important thing.
---
Looks more engaging than the real one
---
It's nothing like that now
---
Tama is Cal/Gal. Try contacting a recruiter for a corp in a militia, running plexes in a corp is way better than solo. I am in a fw Cal corp, so I should know.
---
A. Eve online chat is not built off of Skype for business but ejabberd
---
B. Prior to the infamous chat update eve had a voice chat feature...Almost no one used it.
---
C. As you said this change would be hostile to deaf people
---
D. Could imagine what jita chat would sound like.
---
Hey hey hey, in February it was the other way around in the warzone. Gal was t5 and Cal was t1
---
I am so horribly conflicted.
---
This is a genuinely nice guy. This is someone with executive experience, someone you can talk to. AND he can hold his liquor. Those are not easy things.
---
But he had to mention Tibus Heth. Seriously, what do I make of that? Tibus Heth was a puppet.
---
Few suggestions:
---
Add the mobile app, Neocom II, IOS only
---
Its a eve fitting tool, plus shows you all your character data ESI usually provides from skills, skill que, markets, item values, even will tell you exactly what skills affect a ship+ fitting
---
Also may want to add the sov map, sov.space to the list.
---
Did it drop from a BS, or just a random rat?

increase density, increase payouts, remove local
---
mostly rattingq
---
It was just all the too cool for school nerds not wanting to sit at the front of the bus. The venue has two tiers of seating and a bunch of people chose to sit upstairs or on the comfy benches around the perimeter of the room. In terms of attendance it seemed good to me.
---
We held EDU2014 in the same venue but the upstairs was roped off IIRC so the attendees were more packed in on the ground level.
---
also increase vni dps
---
" .see what happens with barely even numbers? "   
---
Looks like they still got the job done, this is Eve 2019, killing a fleet means nothing if you don't also get your citadel anchored.
---
I guess it's an EM or EM/kinetic missile that the invasion NPCs have so they do omni damage and players can't cheese the sites by just stacking explosive and thermal resists.
---
Resource wars is offering something you can get elsewhere, for less. That's why it's dumb. This is the only source (afaik) of Triglavian salvage, so, like the Abyss, it should be self-balancing.
---
Yes!
---
Talk about a risk averse war deccer. 😂
---
Well I wasn't going to vote but... fuck it... I'll vote for this dude!
---
He seems allright if there's anyone who deserves to win this popularity contest it's this dude here.
---
Also pinapple pizzas are fucking delicious you fuckin' incult flavor heathens!
---
Just checking: Is the time on your phone (or whatever you're using for the 2fa) accurate? Because that's really important. You want it to be within single digit seconds (ideally 1) of TQ (which syncs against atomic clock)
---
I do not know if you want a real answer, but here's one.
---
2 years ago, then Agency 1.0 came out and it was trash. For the past 2 years, it was reiterated upon until 28/05/2019, where it now currently sits at 2.0 or 3.0.
---
I've been playing since late 2015 and I've opened the Agency window a grand total of 20ish time, mostly due to CCP forcing the anomalies escalation into that trash.
---
Want a neat trick? In options, general, untick try new map.
---
Then open the map, you'll see something truly great.
---
Then, if you want to go somewhere to do stuff, use this website: http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map
---
Explore that website, learn the tricks and hidden corners.
---
If you want market, use this: https://evemarketer.com/
---
If you want Blueprint and Industry tools, Loyalty Point Stores, Apps APIs, and a bunch of random stuff, go here: https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/
---
If you want to learn about EVE Online, it's culture, it's niches within niches, you'll need to read and a good place to read stuff about anything and everything is here:  https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page
---
If you want to be teached how to git gud, the Eve University always recruits and trains new pilots everyday. It is a bit of effort to get in, for this is EVE and not only EVE is real, Spies are too, but it's truly great and through their campuses, you'll learn about each aspect of the game.
---
How to get in E-UNI? They have a help channel called E-UNI. It can be found by clicking the chat icon on the Neo-com, then help, then Eve University.
---
E-UNI is the only true alternative to learn about the game if you dont want to read about it.
---
But what is the truely great thing about EVE? It's the community. For we may trashtalk each other to death, when it comes down to it, we all stand together.
---
So, if you truely wish to enjoy Eve Online, here's my personnal recommendation, join Eve University, learn all you can then get out of highsec. Either apply to join Brave, Karmafleet or Horde, or even perhaps if you like small and tight-knit groups, attempt to join one wormhole groups. They prefer people with high skills, but nearly all of them will take in cute newbros and teach you the ropes.
---
Finding a good corp where you feel welcomed and a part of the gang is the best thing one can do. You are under no obligations to ever speak on comms, if thats your thing.
---
Also, post-scriptum, get out of highsec as soon as you can. Please.
---
this video made zero sense
---
They seem to have fixed it.
---
I miss MC/BoB/ISS so much.

How about a lowsec gate to Stain post?
---
I'm in a wh Corp but want to do fw on the side I dont want to leave the Corp I'm in they are very noob friendly and are nice.
---
Remove Nullsec, everyone blue's everyone else and we wardec Concord. We then win Eve!
---
You misunderstand. You login after DT and afk for 24 hours. Same toons all same names everyone knows who you are and the regions basically dead. If you switched it up got creative with your names i and most other wouldn’t notice you. But yes. I guess because you cover regions you’ll get content somewhere- at the price of less content all over
---
Excuse me but his alliance is referencing Mudding not Murder. Murder is illegal, mudding is fun.
---
Supers you say...
---
Tibus Heth is a hero.
---
Also, here is a quick cheap sheet of content:
---
Tama is camped 23/7, do not bother going through there without knowing what you are doing
---
Providence is nullsecurity and Not Red Dont Shoot, which means you can fly through there and you wont get shot on sight while in NPC Corp
---
Faction Warfare is small ship PVP
---
Delve is Goons and a den on sin, isk generation, drunks roams and whale hunting
---
Drone lands are bad and not worth your time to visit
---
All highsec -&gt; nullsec gates are always camped
---
Near every highsec -&gt; lowsec gates are camped
---
Lowsec is a den of dangerous pirates and they will shoot everyone on sight
---
https://www.twitch.tv/rushlock is a great channel to talk to someone every about eve and ask questions
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqxY6hmb_bkii0o8YUoOmSw is their Videos On Demand channel of past broadcasts.
---
On that channel, you'll find Frank (u/Frankthebank22) who's the resident solo pvp guy. He's the guy with the webcam with his name written over it.
---
You'll also find the actual Rushlock (u/rushlock) right after Down Time who'll more than likely be doing (at least he has been doing that for the past 2 years) exploration in sansha space
---
And then there's the random broadcast from Tim, who has a cardboard chair. I dont see his stream often, but he does other games I believe (I dont know his reddit account)
---
If you want to know anything, just reply here and somebody will either spread salt or give an actual answer
---
You're leet m8er

1.   Go to the main menu on the Google Authenticator app
---
2.   'Settings'
---
3.   'Time correction for codes'
---
4.   'Sync now'
---
Lol fantastic. I have played eve for like 5 years and never knew this existed. It seems very cool though! 😊
---
I think the margin is plus-or-minus a minute.
---
Of course, one can just select 'sync now' in the app.
---
Have you tried turning the computer of and on?
---
I remember the days of eve voice... that was terrible quality. Didn't ccp remove it to free up some bandwidth?
---
You had me until pineapple pizza.....
---
here's the best idea from this entire chain
---
don't add to ratting payouts or sites at all because dirty krabs already make enough :thinking:
---
Ill be like "You can click this thousands time more and i will be still waiting for the first task to finish"
---
I've only ever seen you bitch on this sub, you sound like a miserable and bitchy person.

I like his videos and his humor, but how about some serious and uaeful proposals? I've seen none.
---
Unless it is internal customer }:&gt;
---
you can, you just need to compensate it with proper risk
---
removing local compensates in my opinion
---
if i'm enjoying something, then i go and enjoy it.
---
if something sucks, i point out it sucks.
---
i'm not miserable, far from it. if something isn't broken and needs fixing, i'm going to be doing the thing not talking about the thing.
---
what i believe you are experiencing, is called confirmation bias.
---
CCP encouraging carebears to further dig in highsec. Sounds familiar.
---
yes and remove the f1 shortcut from the game to
---
Apparently carebears dislike your adequate ideas. You are endangering the PvE aspect of this dying game. :(
---
It's a new code every 30 seconds. It's possible they're generating the codes around the current one, to give a wider band.
---
Fix your grammar
---
or you can leave the spodbrains to make the same isk they do now
---
it'd be nice if the very clever and elite nullsec hunters could stop thinking like ccp and remember that this thing called wormhole space exists, and if they were any good at hunting they'd try it
---
The Triglavians have agreed to hack the CSM election giving me all the votes I need to be re-elected. In exchange for this they want me to give them the source code to the Darv-Core OS and to assist them in their invasions.
---
"FUCK YOU YOU CAN'T KILL ME, IF YOU KILL MY JF I'M TELLING DADDY MITTANI ON YOU!!!!"
---
This man's CSM chances are about as good as his alliance tbh
---
I miss Battleship mining times :(
---
wormhole space is dead and doesn't matter
---
&gt;or you can leave the spodbrains to make the same isk they do now
---
or they could join the pvpve ecosystem instead of docking up whenever a hostile is 3 jumps away
---
you want a barge
---
more than that, you want an industrial corp. or just a group of guys working together. 
---
5 barges is more efficient than 5 miasmos, but 4 barges 1 miasmos is more efficient still
---
That is correct.
---
Yes please.
---
Actually I prefer chaos. Because it creates opportunities and content. It's usually harmfull for sandbox to have single entity with a lot of power.
---
The best puppets usually are.
---
Joke aside if you could if elected get some pve content like more lvl5 agents spread around and low end like lvl1-2 pirate missions in 0.1-0.3 lowsec that’s would be the knees. 
---
Sansha also shield tank yet the LP store, and drops put out armor instead of the now lore shield tank that would be cool.
---
Long have I also wanted the drones to drop  loot like other npcs. Seems stupid they wouldn’t use a little of everything so loot would be random bits.
---
It shouldn't have taken that long to get the correct feeling we should all have. :P
---
I got you fam. I'll help advertise.
---
imagine being so unaware you don't realize the only reason you're popular is because everyone who actually matters manipulates you and your God awful podcast to spin because the only thing you know how to do well is INTERRUPT SMART PEOPLE SAYING INTERESTING THINGS TO ASK THEM RETARDED QUESTIONS
---
fuck. matterall is the worst
---
like his podcasts but think he has zero clue on game mechanics so wtf is he gonna tell ccp...more immersion srry matty but gtfo. wouldnt be suprised if he got in though...spot wasted
---
At this point id take that over a remove local post any day.
---
the miasmos isn't a mining ship, it's just a specialized ore hauler. for the mining itself you'd want to use a ship with bonuses to mining yield/miner cycling time so you can get the most out of it. if you have omega account you can start with mining barges (procurer/retriever for example) and work your way up. basically you mine with the barge, dump the ore at a station/citidel and use the miasmos to move it
---
&gt; wormhole space is dead and doesn't matter
---
Matters more than the incompetent shitlers "hunting" in null or thinking their 40m/hr is incredible isk
---
&gt;or they could join the pvpve ecosystem instead of docking up whenever a hostile is 3 jumps away
---
They dock up, they're not making ISK, you're stopping them from contributing to taxes and buying their next shitfit super that'll die in a week.
---
you're not going to need turrets, you need a barge with drones, and a miasmos to pick things up in that's all it's for
---
&gt;the incompetent shitlers "hunting" in null  
---
Sooo wormholers?
---
They would never leave the simulated combat arena. This is literally the differentiator that Eve offers.
---
&gt; Verify (cache)
---
&gt; Sometimes cache files can become corrupted for a variety of reasons that can reach from transfer errors during patches to defective sectors on the hard drive. This can cause various issues while playing the game, such as crashes, graphic issues or missing information in game windows. In such cases, it can often be very helpful to verify the integrity of the files in the shared cache folder. Clicking "Verify" will check all files and attempt to redownload any corrupt or incomplete files in order to repair them.

If you’re currently in Horde, the best way to make friends is to be active (and on mumble) in one of the small-medium sigs/bigs/interest groups. The mainline Horde is just as blobby and faceless anywhere else.
---
A good group to start with in Horde is the newbean mining (pvp) crowd. It’s mostly just chatting on comms and socialising until Darkness decides to feed more bombers to the beans.
---
I’m in another part of Panfam and still drop in to say hi to those guys.
---
&gt;Sooo wormholers?
---
More the very elite players somehow finding their way to null without autopilot and then complaining that having gone to non-wormhole space there is local and they can't do anything
---
I'm not a single issue voter, but when it comes to pizza toppings I may as well be.
---
Just say No to pineapple pizza
---
Solid choice.

Hi, I have been playing Eve off and on for about 12 years now, the last time was three years ago. I am thinking of getting back into Eve again, but I would like to join a REAL corp, and do the things you read about every now and then on the internet. I do not mind learning new things, I would love to learn combat, as I cannot hold my own against the Guristas, never mind actual humans opponents. But, my focus has been with the Ore mining ships.
---
I am a 35m sp ultra carebear who, in all his years, has never ventured more than 8-10 jumps away from Jita. I have never intentionally stepped into lowsec, and I have spent all my time mining, exploring, and industrialising in and around Mitsolen (back when they used to have the ice belts there).
---
My character has focused learning skills almost entirely in the Ore ship line, and as such within one moth of omega time, I will have a level 3 certificate wit the Orca. My eventual aim has always been to captain a Rorqual, and my skills and training have been entirely focused on achieving that goal. I am within four months of the start of my Rorqual training career, so I would like to be a part of a corp that has need of the use of those services.
---
How can I make this happen?
---
Edit: hahaha After going Omega, all training times have been cut in half, in two months I can have matched the requirements to capatin a Rorqual... Duh. (I did not read the small print).
---
Every person of interest is detained at a crime scene until they can be interviewed, and there were more than just two detained around that crime scene. Of course, that hasn't stopped the ignorant conspiracy theories. 
---
The one you are parroting I believe refers to two men that were detained in the woods around the school. They were positively ID'd as reporters trying to get in close to get photos etc., as sleezy as that is. 
---
Turn off the Info Wars
---
eve players too strong man soz
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UT8RkSmN4k
---
There's a different one in the sidebar - https://discordapp.com/invite/3PsU6p4, I assume that's the same one.
---
ill join that
---
I have an Alpha account. That makes sense though. Anything I can do to get to where I'm looking at?
---
Matro you love it 😋😋
---
As a F2P player, which I'm assuming means your Alpha since you are new, your only mining ship is a venture. It actually has bonuses. You could use the miasmos, but that's a lot of moving between hangers. It would still be more efficient to just use the venture and warping to a structure to drop off ore.
---
You could also try a mining battleship. A very old school way to do it. Amarr or Gallente would be best due to number of low slots for cargo expanders.
---
But tbh, ratting or exploration would get you isk faster to F2P yourself into an omega account. Then train into a mining barge or a porpoise/orca
---
Are there any barges I can get as an Alpha account?
---
Maybe even links to faction warfare 🤔
---
I was just thinking of mining turrets. Are there any good barges for Alpha players?
---
I'd pay good money for a dab emote
---
Open "The Agency,"  click "Tutorials," click "Career Agents" and click "Industry Career Path"
---
This will start a series of intro missions that will give you some cash, a Venture (the best mining ship you can use), and some skills.
---
Do we hear mirror reflections too now?
---
The Ancients was created just under two years ago. The NPSI alliance was placed on hold until a very few dedicated pilots finished their work uniting all of EvE's NPSI groups and essentially bring the public PvP realm back to life. Now we have succefully done that and finalising a partnership with eve uni to train up these PVPers /FC's for all the NPSI communities. We now have time to do many great things that were simply impossible before.  With the recent changes done by CCP manifesting in our favour it has made it more possible than ever to set up an orginisation like this. There will be some pretty big news coming from the NPSI world soon tm.
---
Most of the NPSI leadership. Myself from Spectre, Virion, Samara, Coaxter, Keacte, Ex Bombers bar. Decided it was finally time we had an ingame presence.  The majority of our pilots and the market we appeal to are, pilots who thrive off of no obligation PvP. We have many great solo, small gang pvpers who just want to be left alone. We have NPSI pilots /corps People who just fly with public PvP groups. We also are starting to get serious PvP corps who love the notion of having the freedom to fly with or against anyone. We think its a niche in game that is yet to be filled. Its very appealing to those who are GRRR sov.
---
The live opening has only been active for one month, we are the top 20 alliances this month with amazing kills.  We understand this gameplay is not for everyone. That said, We are growing and its amazing to see how quickly we are growing and the types of individuals we have.

---
You eve radio dj's are an evil lot &gt;.&gt;
---
D: Pretty much like goon’s hon hooon shit
---
The Miasmos actually drops mined ore straight to the ore hold, but it's still wildly inefficient as compared with the Venture.
---
it's a game where groups of players are counted in the thousands.
---
pretty much every corp/alliance is going to have racists somewhere just by virtue of racists existing, and groups being large.
---
and quite frankly, when it comes to the csm you could spend your free time killing kittens for fun and i'd still vote for you if you were able to represent the playerbase to ccp better than all the other candidates, since that's all i'm voting for you based upon.
---
No, Alpha players are restricted to the Venture mining frigate. Barges and exhumers are locked behind Omega.
---
mlyp
---
Linking year old posts as “proof”
---
No. If you want to pursue mining your going to have to go omega.
---
Unless you want to train into a battleship or battlecruiser and slap mining turrets on it.
---
The venture is what you want as an alpha.
---
A venture mines at least 4x of efficiency of a one turret industrial
---
Extra ore hold is meaningless while it will take you forever to fill it up
---
I'm sorry Dunk, You lost my Vote
---
You didn't do "The Dunk Dinkle" and take a shot after introducing yourself
---
If you Want it back I think we need a video of you doing 14 shots in honor of running for CSM 14
---
How can you accurately "Represent the player base" if you yourself cannot see that race itself is a meaningless factor in determining ones worth ? If think an arbitrary trait is indicative of anything more then melanin content how can we trust you to be a good judge of what the game needs ?
---
Use a venture and jet can your ore when it fills.  When your can is full go dock up and come back in your miasmos and scoop.  Head back out.  
---
Remember to bookmark your can!!
---
Or make friends with a dude who has an orca and will allow you use of his fleet hangar.  
---
When I started this game some dude flew out to my belt in this massive beast of a ship and my path was forged in mining.  He basically paid me on the spot for every load I’d dropped into the fleet hangar.
---
In lore concord ships are decent but not imba.  They seem imba against capsulers as the Jove gave them the ability to interfere with the pod’s control over your ship.  So basically your ship has a 0 sp pilot.  You no longer have skills to pilot your ship.  That’s why they don’t fight rats.  And they are small in numbers
---
Yep. Have hot spots. Controlling them like a plex zone controls the trig rats in a system. Eve 2 incoming baby. I like it.
---
Also 12 upvotes, CCP hire me. I'm an ideas guy. I already have a better approval rating for my idea.
---
What's ratting and how would I got about with exploration?
---
I'll admit, the pineapple pizza made me question voting for him.  The 3 shots at the end sold me.
---
Look up EVE University they’ll sort you out,
---
Think you’re confused with the open comms show
---
&gt; but test being light in numbers and logi cannot really hold against alpha either
---
?????????????????
---
I’m not voting for him for one reason:  I like TiS too much and I know him being on the CSM will cause for changes.  I’m sorta surprised they even allowed him to maintain his candidacy
---
Tempted to run logi. I've never once done logi and 5 in all logi skills. What's the worst that could happen lol. Famous last words.
---
you jest, but https://www.livescience.com/28676-plants-grow-gold.html
---
I wouldn't mind kms being delayed a few days just so I could see the occasional dick waving on Reddit get memed a few days later when the BR comes out.
---
The best you can get as an alpha is a praxis with full cargo expander low slots and full miner highslots. It's probably decently out of your price range, and will need a friend in an orca to hold the ore, so unless you're dead set on mining you're best starting out with something else.
---
Thx for your suggestions but no luck so far 😐
---
Since when did DJ's Retirement Fund joined NC? (lul)

oh sure, allegations of racism from someone called *Black*hatobvi - I think you meant *AfricanAmerican*Hatobvi

No.

if I was Creecher it would be Ni\*\*gerhatobvi

DeadCo can't even utilize 1/2 of Dek without renting it out. RR might have an interest in Tenal. After Goons go home NCPL gonna make Sort his chew toy.

I do understand how teh game works, at least to a decent expense. I've got 14mil sp, if that tells you anything?

This is literally srs bizness, I don't want someone who commits such war crimes to represent me on the CSM.  He even ate without a table and had no qualms whatsoever!  The man's a psychopath!
---
It is a subtle attempt to stop you from flying Muninns.
---
Panfam  controls the north/ north eastish 
---
The imperium  controls the west 
---
Legacy(Test) controls the south
---
Darkness and Co. control the north west. 
---
south east is all renters and nobody important
---
&gt; yeah but that's bad gameplay, if you can't recognize that that's bad
---
Their corp/alliance misses out on ISK over it. They personally miss ISK over it. It's just people bitching because they can't get their killmail but also aren't willing to dare go somewhere as scary as the big bad wormhole
---
lol just find a group that doesn't talk about old person stuff then
---
tbh just go to wormholes. everything is better there, even the people. even people like chain smoking, detestable as they are, are better than null
---
Just grow a thicker skin, assholes are everywhere.
---
No but your response does.
---
I do hear that wormhole stuff is nice. I haven't played even since like a year or two ago. Is there anything frigate to cruiser based I can be doing is WH space?
---
Tibus Heth is merely a plaything of The Broker. He deserves nothing of the praise bestowed upon him.

oh no he said a word i don't like on the internet, time to give power to the word!

Yeah, join goons. Their leader publicly advocated for someone to kill themselves. Then asked his moron followers to harass the individual to further push him to suicide.

Goons shouldn’t throw rocks, you live in a glass house.

The bigger issue is that Creecher got away with saying things that nobody else would have gotten away with and the only reason he got away with it was because hes part of high command. How can you expect a Alliance to be run fairly when they wont even follow their own rules.
---
But, but, ancient alien steel beams under pizzashops turn melting frogs gay

I didn't mean to be snarky like that. I just didn't know if there was anything for me at EVE University if I have something around 14 Million SP. I figured that was a decent marker for progress, if anything.

I didn't justify anything - I had been saying internally that fixing the bug was a good thing, but there had to be a way to not hurt WHers. After the blog post came out, I was immediately engaging. Exzooki never talked to me, but plenty of other WHers did.  I remember all of this because I was there and doing it. Exzooki has no idea what was said in the room at the summit beyond what was in the minutes, and the minutes reflect that CCP acknowledged this was an issue for WHers and pledged to fix it. 
---
You'll also note that he was fucking wrong - he said they wouldn't get a fix done because they'd never gotten one done before, but this time CCP actually fixed it.  Why do you think that happened? 
---
Here's a hint - it wasn't because somebody made a shitpost on reddit. 
---
You can argue your philosophy about representation all you want - what I don't want to see is you making false statements about my record and claiming I'm saying things I didn't say.
---
Whaa-whaa-whaa. I did something dumb and got yelled at. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. You need to inject thick skin and train that shit to at least 4. Otherwise eve just ain’t for you.
---
The Goons now have a faction within their alliance for queerswarm while Test still uses "Jewing" in an official capacity on their forums. Seems like the goons are pushing for accepting the differences that make their community diverse while test still sticks to immaturity.
---
That's not light numbers, it's letting your fleets get split and feeding. Bad coordination is not fighting outnumbered, it's losing and not knowing when to leave
---
I believe your forgetting to mention that your coalition is probably the biggest part that is killing and stagnating the game. That + all the goon CSM dudes that managed to sneak in 90% of all broken/boring mechanics in the last years.
---
I remember when goons went into null for the first time, those where the glory days of eve online. Who had any idea you would grew into the monstrosity that is goons + friends today.
---
almost all of it
---
Same.  I treasure it.  Dunk for Prez, 2020!
---
Pm me bro I'll sort you out😁
---
In every thread there must be a goon insisting that their/their allies losses don't matter. Only their enemy's losses matter.
---
The hard truth is CCP for legitimate reasons doesn't want alpha characters to be very efficient at mining. Just know that going forward.
---
The Alpha skill set is tailored toward combat activities, and Omega status is required to unlock most if not all of the major industry skills.
---
Now that said, an Alpha in a venture can mine a respectable amount but you are going to be purposefully limited with the size of your ore hold. But, [an alpha in a venture mining gas in a wormhole will make a nice stack of cash](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/guide-ninja-gas-mining-as-alpha-in-wormholes/4920). Your risk is very minimal (10 mill for a fit venture. maybe less?), its probably the easiest reliable isk source for an alpha, the down side is spending time scanning wormholes.

I started FCing at age 14. I successfully ran for election to the CSM age 19.

Air defence is defending your airspace, it's not defending against the air.

It's not too hard. We need logi bros real bad haha
---
Why would hunters in null care enough in the first place to hunt in wormholes? You guys make much of being neutral in nullsec politics, but seem confused as to why we should then give a shit about you and your dead-ass space holes.
---
You like wormholes, your krabs are better. Blah blah blah we've all heard it a million times and it never gets less stupid.
---
Well man. Good on you dude.
---
Dude the *salt* alone would be worth it, ratings be damned.
---
Is this Creecher reddit account ?  because if you are this statement shows that you don't even begin to understand what you did wrong nor the implications of it.
---
This is incorrect, it's defence of your airspace. It's not limited to air-based threats, but it is limited to defence of your airspace.

you sure use a lot of irrelevant data in forming your argument about creecher for a guy arguing that another guy used irrelevant data

how can you accurately condemn a guy for a thing if you yourself cannot not do that same thing? if think an arbitrary opinion is indicative of anything more than that one irrelevant thing how can we trust you to make a good argument of what this thread is about?

I'd love to get involved, but IRL is a pain and I can't even log in. You guys sound awesome, just wish I had free time, or listened to anything other than Classic Rock
