Oh, now we are calling it an event? Do you have a source?
---
---
---
triangles will fail
---
People mislabeling their flair on r/eve??? That can't possibly be true
---
Just STFU. No one cares
---
You jest, but those actually sound pretty dope
---
too busy dying to adapt
---
Only some of them have the DD the null fleets just wreck face no need for a DD
---
Hasn't Star Citizen been in production for like 15 years?
---
well I guess you should remember something a wise man once told me...
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
adapt or die
---
and yet you're the ones sperging out about it. That fireside must've really been interesting eh
---
Alright alright alright, let's see what we've got.
---
Undocking implies consent.
---
Do it, we will just min max it as usual and find a way to break it. 
---
P.S. I love how you think that lowsec doesn't already have to deal with camped gates/plexes, its almost like you have no fucking clue what anything but rorqual farming is all about...
---
Most renters are not going to be protected anyway when push comes to shove. That leaves usurping the owners, and the owners are usually heavily armed and have beachheads in every system connected to you (other renters, their own systems etc).
---
In the cache war, I told X.I.X. that my alliance was breaking off from them. We were not renting, but neither were we willing to give up all of the systems we'd worked for 2 years to defend, just to go and be their fodder.
---
However, once our standings were revoked (they did dozens of alliances at once) what we had left in their space, was stranded... logistics routes were cut off and that was that, a few supers got moved under cloak and self-destructing cynos, but everything that was left had to be asset safety'd.
---
If you want to limit renting, you have to add more neutral space to run logistics through.
---
I am not so certain, we'll see how it shakes out. Looks grim for goons right now, but they where away.
---
But if this keep up there will be alot less large deployment and more slow map creep. Or not! Exciting times :)
---
Rats don't blow up your Ansiblex, fella.
---
I'm not sure you want to kick you're entire alliance mate
---
&gt;  I'd like to see you try to call TIKLE "psuedo renters" to their face.
---
what are they gonna do, drop carriers on my af?
---
And I'm done
---
tbf I know almost nothing about lowsec aside from how to avoid being smartbombed. And I only have one Rorqual thankyouverymuch
---
Let's run the math:
---
1. The name of the expansion is Invasion
---
2. They've been spooling up this story arc for a year
---
3. They (relatively) recently introduced new lines of ships from the faction at war with these guys
---
4. It's summer, a time of year that traditionally has less activity
---
Like I said, I guess it's possible that this is a glitch or even the new normal, but I think the odds are that it's a lore event they've been planning for a long time.
---
In days long back, when we used to fly under the flag of our lord and savior wallymarts...our young hero, Keithstone, was trying to gain favor from the group.  In doing so, he brought up how he loves his hyperion, and that his hyperion was the best, and hyperion, hyperion. hyperion.
---
We all took turns 'ribbing' him by bringing up, and overusing the word, 'hyperion' the whole fleet we were chasing some local invaders back home.
---
[I never saw the kill mail pop up but the notification came on discord ](https://i.imgur.com/3QfQTLy.jpg)
---
skynet is coming
---
I for one kind of like the idea of HS systems temporarily being void of Concord for an undetermined about of time.
---
*Apollo Tyrannos and Zorya Triglav have joint the fight*
---
should that be the case? yes, is it the case? no
---
just look at the patches this last year alone
---
If this guy is who I think he is, he's a retard. Ive spoken to him before in game.
---
Rip OP :'(
---
You either fucked up really REALLY badly... Or you stuck your dick in crazy.
---
Either way, you have my deepest sympathies :(
---
yeh my cousin told me it was french :D guess im just dumb :D
---
That statement will be regretted if the prices of minerals go up as high as I'm anticipating
---
I'd be happy if everything burns over a week or two and then CCP calls it off and uses as an excuse to change FW, NS and LS rats and PVE things, Null sov and structures mechanic; or at least one of those.
---
They're vulnerable, but they use real player tactics, have very good AI, and they don't have idiots derping, they can all fucking anchor.
---
You are misremembering, however you cannot extract Alpha skills while in Alpha, you need to be Omega to extract skills that can be trained in Alpha state.
---
no structures no problems (⌐■_■)
---
The way it should be :D
---
Lul we can't even get a proper filter system... Battle clinic even did that right...
---
I'd like be able to see my history with x ship in x system vs x pilot.   Battle clinic had this...
---
hahahah i get it because skateboarding is hard
---
Wormholers been dealing with drifters for years now......boo hoo. I feel like your sandbox just got ruined.....Ruined!
---
C'est ça que j'adore dans ce sub, la moitié des posts sont des shitposts ou des concentrés de sel!
---
TEST has done that before
---
Out of curiosity, how many of those 40 structures are at least semi critical to alliance function?
---
to whoever put them up for their workflow, probably very.  Alliances distribute workloads, workloads take workflows
---
The Invasion expansion has to do with the Triglavians.
---
The Drifters, if at war with the Triglavians, would be attacking the Triglavians if things were working properly.
---
The ONLY comment from CCP was from a single GM.
---
Yes, it is getting to be summer, so introducing something like this would be a bad idea.
---
By the math that I have presented, it is a bug, not an invasion.
---
Toss PvP fit on. Venture and aim for the head
---
There's no math in your post! I want a refund.
---
Are you guys salty because you couldn't system camp with your camping structures?
---
I don’t play eve. Tried a few times years and years ago and felt it was super complicated. Might get back in but always enjoy reading the stories from the game. 
---
With that said, why is the latest drifter invasion a surprise to so many people when the latest expansion was titled “Invasion”?
---
While I can't say I agree with your hyperbole, or even that you individually worked hard for alliance infrastructure assets, I will say that long-term (I say this because we honestly don't know the duration of the NPC deployments, and CCP has been known to leave half finished stuff sitting around for literally years at a time), it could be not so great.   
---
Most of the coalitions seem to be recalling to their owned space and playing a defensive game against NPCs, rather than an offensive or defensive game against players. In the short term, this is hilarious and a little exciting, in the long term, I'm not sure it is. Using Delve as an example, while Imperium dudes are out doing things elsewhere, hunters get great content farming whoever decided to stay and be stupid. It's good for everyone, hunters get kills, bads get blown up, industrial dudes make additional sales, etc, etc. However you choose to spin the events, at the end of the day, players killing players is good for the game. I'm not sure you can say the same thing about NPCs causing players to be cautious and stay home.   
---
Does anyone need another reason not to go get in a fight right now? Does anyone need more reasons to stay home and krab under an umbrella?    
---
Again, short term, hilarious and a little exciting, long term, maybe not a great idea as it feels like it would cause additional stagnation in a game that already suffers heavily from it. I could be wrong, we'll see.   
---
TLDR: CCPlz dont leave your half finished shit lying around again. In most cases it's harmless, it may not be here.
---
Shrinks the size of the space you can defend.  May be able to defend 1 or 2 regions on timers, much past that will take a lot of defenders.  
---
Impacts Timezone tanking on structures as you will likely need to defend against drifters
---
Also gonna impact rental empires.  No one will rent if they don't have their own defense.  And if they have enough to defend a system or two, then just wait a month for the big blocks to shrink and get space without paying rent.
---
This is an amazing time to be playing.
---
I for one don't think this is scripted at all. CCP recently talked about the war between NPCs that noone saw and hinted that they could play around with the standings and things would happen. I think they did exactly that and that is also why they are not commenting on it yet. Everything we see is in acceptable parameteres but not exactly planned. I suppose until they do comment this theory is as good as any tho.
---
It was no longer economically viable to retain him.
---
Well, you're certainly justifying it by calling it "weird" instead of bad. 
---
That's some spod brain attitude of justifying incompetence with "We're just having fun XD". Everyone's capable of being a stupid idiot every once in a while and there's nothing wrong with being one so long as it's identified and corrected. 
---
Hell, we talked so much shit and were extremely critical to each other in kingless. And it was amazing because it formed a culture of continual improvement. 
---
Nothing personal, the attitude just bugs me and it makes me sad for the state of the game. I used to think tuskers tried to improve their players and had fun trying to get better. But I guess that's not the case anymore if this is the prevailing attitude.
---
I mean they're already attacking ratting VNIs, one can only hope...
---
Me big blue me mad have to fighting big drifter birds, ugh, ugh.
---
And then Sansha will rise above them both
---
It still does...
---
Fair points, but this would be quite the odd bug if it is one. It's timed nicely with the Triglavian invasions, when CCP has been publicly reflecting about that one NPC vs. NPC vs. NPC battle that happened a while back, and right after a bunch of new weapons/ships have been handed to us. I think the pieces fit together. Either way, I guess we'll find out!
---
I'm also curious whether we'll see Drone or Sansha activity in the next month or two, too.
---
Peak risk aversion is joining the largest player group in the game.
---
I am informed of your achievements, descendant of Azdaja.  I am not impressed by them.
---
Nothing can stop the flow of Vyraj.
---
Just to have the drifters blow it up.
---
Good voice
---
They hit Frat staging, then smashed TEST bubble factory and it's friendly campers.
---
Sorry man, can't say math was ever really my strong suit. I was a liberal arts major   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
grafic desing is my pashin :clap:
---
Their lock and shoot time seem to be practically instant so its not like paying attention to when they hit grid is going to help you. I was in a bomber fleet last night and while chasing them off an station we lost like 3 ceptors in a row who were trying to get us a warp in on them because the second you hit their engagement range they just blap you, one second your fine the next your whole overview red boxes you and your in a pod.
---
I'd rather see a more extensive character creation like we used to have... but where the player gets to choose some ships, weapons, skills, and various other items to start with. From that, you can just handout a default set of skills already trained and start playing. Get them going with 2mil sps.
---
Not without a permit
---
The price of an expansive empire is being forced to protect all of it. 
---
Eve hasn't really done a good job of punishing that for a very long time, and now it is.
---
I don't have that pack yet so if I add the omega time to the total it gets even more ridiculous. Straight up double or close to triple the value of other options.
---
Here is a sheet I set up to calculate the rough ISK / euro values for some of the common packs and isk places.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q1n8Xeob41B14gN-LDgi2dbIxEmYnNyfztNnDSN_js0/edit
---
Copy to your own drive and edit the currency and values for your situation but I'm guessing it works out the same way in pounds and dollars.
---
they are killing anything they can get their hands on, pods, ships, stations, flex structures, if they can lock it they shoot it.
---
shit does drifter have nukes? if so  god's help nullsec.
---
Let's not forget the fact that drifters killing are killing structures, which for the most part are built from the most afk of all materials, planetary production.
---
Make some friends and join a mining corp you greedy bastard.
---
Do we know if they were actually ratting? Or did some idiot think they could warp their super onto a drifter gate camp and blap them with fighter bombers because they've never fought them before?
---
I'm not saying it IS a bug, before someone misquotes me lol. Yes, so far the word is working as intended, it just makes zero sense.
---
This salt pleases me.
---
Salt
---
Oh man thanks so much for this piece of ammo. He’s going to hear nonstop about it lol
---
Cookie clicker empires don't content as content.
---
Please remember there was no capital plates back then. That said it is still pretty bad but not awful for a pre-citadel Titan
---
And mining anomalies now respawn in a random system in the region.
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn...
---
&gt;Do you accept contracts with trillion isk colleteral? Im willing to pay extra, no questions asked.
---
Remember they can peek inside the courier package :)
---
You sound like a pussy
---
adapt or die.
---
Cat ears accessory plx
---
as someone who hunts on a periodic basis (ayyy) in period basis, no one ever gets saved. ever.
---
But my null sec corp needs capital ships built...
---
So close!
---
&gt;Does anyone need another reason not to go get in a fight right now?
---
exactly
---
Drifters fucking off into obscurity for so long was one of the things that pissed me off as a wormholer. Makes me happy that they're finally making good on that whole fucking shit up thing they were supposed to be doing.
---
Smashing that re sub button so hard
---
Gandhi nooooo! You 4 peace!!!
---
I didn't even notice the flair. I just figured you for a purged goon because you actually knew about the cultural revolution. It was such a non-event for everyone except the people we drove out in its name.
---
Because the behavior of the NPCs was always predictable and fairly easy to counter. The NPCs also never went after player built starbases in mass before.
---
Now the AI is much smarter and they are also attacking player starbases.
---
It makes for a much more engaging game is sharply shaking up a meta game that badly needed spicing.
---
In a word it’s awesome.
---
Imagine being this out of touch with the world, in TYOOL 2019.
---
Round 1 Fight!
---
Lol you think they'd do the math before creating a self-sustaining (anti-profit too) p2w
---
I'm happy with my 7m SP
---
There's a logic pattern or narrative that we haven't worked out yet. Not sure if we're supposed to solve the puzzle or if it becomes clearer after another development.
---
Trigs are only in high sec for the moment, right? And the Drifters are only hitting nullsec? Are either of them in low sec?
---
Yeah, a Civilian Cruiser Hull! Not enough slots/stats to even come close to matching a standard Cruiser. No exploit to be found.
---
The expansion has to do with invasions....
---
Stfu ear lice muncher
---
So what you're saying is you want more skins? gotcha.
---
So the drifters are the Black Plague to shake things up noice noice
---
the problem is there is nothing to engage that isn't well under a super umbrella, so really what your telling small gangs is to stop flying ( something most are already doing ) leading to eve less to engage.
---
They would all have something churning in them.  Those jobs are the end products or components in larger builds.  They wouldn’t defend them if the structures could be sacrificed.  
---
We’re not talking about random astras here
---
CCP has secretly been working on Eve 2 for a decade, the other projects were just smokescreen memes to keep us distracted.
---
This event will wipe out all of New Eden and then Eve 2 launches.
---
Everyone loves the drifter till they lose something to em ahahah
---
I like boosting them instead of combining them. From a data standpoint it is feasible for CCP to boost them, and prohibitively difficult for them to combine them by comparison.
---
A Brazilian? If you say so, chief.

They are the ring/storm/circle of battle royale.

&gt;Most importantly, it returns the sense of hard and uncertain game to EvE. That is what I fell in love with when I started.

The point of eve is for all that to be done by other players.  A PvE event that ends PvP wars is dumb.

No.

The magic 14 are not mandatory, especially not for a number of non-pewpew goals, and they teach new players about the impacts of various skills on the many different areas of the game.
---
They're a useful teaching tool, in addition to the many benefits that they give to the player.
---
well ccp disagrees with you, and they are the one rolling the patches out soooooo
---
Pop a xanax you monkey.
---
As someone who is desperately trying to get into Eve, I don't doubt it. If other players have my luck, then finding a decent corp can be a daunting process. I managed to find one, but after some stupid stuff and drama, everyone left. Hell, I had the CEO tell me it wasn't even their intention to provide content. I just wanted to try small group PvE or PvP.
---
Honestly, there's only so much I can do alone and still be entertained with a solo/inexperienced players budget.

The Drifters should work towards ending your posting.

Anyone got advice for a new player?

I guess if it's already on the docket, sure. I just think it's a low value to have them combined (and it makes me sad for training them those many years ago) if they could just boost new people past needing to care.

Funny thing tho. None of those games would issue a ban on a player and then ignore him when he attempts to get information regarding his ban, auto-closes his tickets, submits evidence of his innocence, or refuses to comment to a journalist about it.  
---
Hell, in Warframe, if you get the absolute worst GM who responds to you, Ramon, he still does respond.
---
A few, but probably only because they were indie games and in early access.  Interestingly, both were engineering sims.
---
Space Engineers and Stationeers, in case anyone's interested.  Both have active discord servers and (at least for Stationeers) the devs are extremely talkative.
---
Other games I've played, I never heard a peep from the devs.  OTOH, I never needed to know how the game worked to make the most of it, so I wasn't inclined to go talk to them...
---
*Justin starts telling a joke about Goons but is laughing so hard we can’t understand him*

Sadly EVE is a very much margin game, despite some heists etc reaching wider circulation. Even though the lore is pretty interesting, I can see why outside entities would be hesitant to back a project like that, and CCP themselves don't have the financial muscle. Pearl Abyss might have the oomph, but hard to say if even they would be up for the risk.
---
Burn the fringes. Then the gates. Make the world a little smaller.
---
Who's got the 'wow nice...' checklist?
---
&gt;I don't think they are mutually exclusive.
---
It is when rats are sieging your structures.
---
Like, people seem to think structures are just big fat damage capped targets in space that you have to grind through for \~reasons\~
---
But most citadels that are dropped have a purpose. Random Raitaru #198 out of 300? Someone is building T2 ships or modules. Athanor? Probably a moon mining citadel, or an expensive refinery for production. Fortizar or Astrahus? Corp-level staging point.
---
Sure a lot of them are abandoned, and something should be done about that. (In fact, they already did with the low power mechanics) Having personally just spent the past month sieging tribute at 4am in the morning, I would also love to see some changes to that grind myself. But with outposts removed from the game, all these structures are utterly critical, no matter what your alliance size is. To have a relentless AI pinging them at random 24/7 is utterly ridiculous, and the endgame isn't hard to speculate.

So... you deploy some kind of gizmo in a random solar system, and it magically prevents anyone from coming in there with too large of ships? How does that work? Does it prevent Stargates from activating? Does it prevent ships from Bridging in when the tiny little Frigate lights a Cyno? What about all the big ships that were staged in the system before the gizmo was activated? Are they allowed to remain, or do they get magically teleported out of system?
---
This idea kinda sorta sucks, FYI.
---
not really, things is you just not know how they will react to supers being dropped and shit, so yes it is unclear(for it might not work). There is no sisi to test this out, and its been happening for a little over 24 hours so honestly its understandable

Gandhi, not only are our word backed WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS, but we also casually fire them off at each other whenever we're bored. It's a recreational activity known as frigate PVP.
---
No it means that’s the biggest ship that can be built
---
Or bring back CCPizza
---
First, understand that historically NPCs in EvE were very predictable. They were specific to a each area, did a certain type of damage, and followed a known routine.
---
This resulted in EvE players long ago figuring out ships that could destroy the NPCs easily with minimal to no actual player interaction. In other words, warp to the NPCs and turn your drones to aggressive and come back latter to a lot of dead NPCs (worth ISK). 
---
That in turn lead to people writing Bots to do it while the player was not even around at all. The Bots also typically have tools built into them to watch local. As soon as a neutral appears in local the Bot has the ship warp out to a safe. It makes the Bot difficult to catch. Its a massive issue and cheating.
---
Now lets introduce these drifters. They are running a much smarter / learning AI. They are not predictable. They do not show up in local. They are powerful enough they are a real challenge and can kill even expensive ships that are not being smartly piloted. 
---
Its a Bots running players bad dream. Its beautiful.
---
Real players would get that message aswell, if I'm out ratting ( god forbid that would ever happen) I too would like to know about these fleets
---
You’re being the most passive aggressive bitch right now.  Please stop.

this sounds like an even more cancerous, grindy version of what we already have. Now not only do we have to toaster things but we have to toaster them in a specific order and they take even longer to toaster then they already do?

Bjorn bee is a twitch streamer, who also has highlights on YouTube occasionally.

---
KB measures one facet of gameplay, in a sandbox game that advertising as such and encourages people to do whatever they want.  
---
What if an Eve player purposefully flies around looking for solo fights, and takes pretty much everything that comes their way? Sure, they'll die more often, but not because they suck, but rather that they don't run away as often as the next guy who only engages when its safe to do so and runs away most of the time.  
---
But if you compared their two killboards, then one guy looks like he's the best that ever lived, while the other has a bunch of losses day in and day out.  
---
In a fight over something meaningful, I'd rather have the guy who routinely went up against shit that he knew he probably wouldn't beat (but still winning some of those, and coming out of it that much better), than the guy who only ganks when he thinks he can win without a chance of losing anything.  
---
Why? Because the first guy is simply better at the game. He's challenged himself over and over, and learned from each fight, and gotten better. The other guy is just risk-adverse, and hardly ever gets into a situation that tests his skills, so he never gets any better.  
---
I'll never understand how the biggest sandboxy game out there managed to attract so many crowd followers attached to meaningless stats that can be massaged any way you want to make yourself look good, when you're really not. Example: Almost all killboards are setup to count any ship you went into combat against as a kill, while only your ship blowing up is a death. So, you get into a 10v10 brawl, and everyone managed to blow everyone up. The killboard shows that you "won" the fight, because you got 10 kills, and only 1 death. Over 90% efficiency! I'm l33t! Reality is that the fight ended evenly, and if it was a real measure of what truly took place, you'd have 50% efficiency.  
---
Now join a 100 man fleet, and the same shit happens, and you're 99% efficient!  
---
It's a really stupid way to count things in a game where large fleets routinely shoot at each other. Yet, that's the standard, because it makes everyone look so good stats wise.  
---
Can't you see how silly it all is? Just go have fun and stop worrying about your virtual numbers as if they measure anything useful.
---
Pretty standard for 100mn afk boats. That one appears to be an alpha character, so likely needs more to be stable.

Well according to google, the last fireside was posted before the drifters started doing their thing, and it wasn't done by Mittens, so I have no idea wtf that guy was talking about
---
Give me the launch codes, 30 seconds to pinpoint coordinates and hold my beer. If I'm not back in 5 minutes it's your beer.
---
Thanks! That sounds great!
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
This is your bible
---
Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
Don't get attached to your ships.
---
Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
Resurrected Iapetan Titans
---
Factorio, to add to that list.
---
Holy shit, I'm upvoting Grath!  
---
Some of these alliance leaders are coming across as pretty whiny in all of this.  
---
Players have figured out the game to the point where everything is fairly safe, so CCP shakes up the snowglobe a bit, and instead of just having fun with it, they start complaining about having no warning, etc, etc.  
---
That's the entire point! You got blindsided, and shit just got real. Remember the old days when it felt like you might actually lose something so important to you that you got the shakes?  
---
How's the thought of losing all your sov and structures making you feel?  
---
(Answer: Like you're actually playing Eve again.)
---
No space in Eve is safe and you should consider anything deployed or undocked in space as free game. Regardless of it being killed by an NPC or players, especially in Null Sec. If you want safety there's always High Sec
---
Once you over-complicate a solution to that degree, it's not a good idea anymore.
---
No he's not. He's said that the problem was that it wasn't restricted to new players, which isn't the problem. The problem was that they did it at all, and broke a promise they made about directly selling SP for $.  
---
Not to mention there's a plethora of people who have been banned by CCP under false pretenses and they refuse to talk about it or do anything about it.
---
I don't play it because if I did, I'd become addicted to it.
---
[almost for got to link last week’s thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c2vsf7/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_june_20/)
---
1. Let's put our artillery in front of our infantry.
---
2. Let's completely have no fucking clue what light cavalry is used for.
---
The lowliest grunt in ASCEE could FC that shit more effectively.
---
And the alternative is just don't catch up? Cause that's how it was before. I honestly don't know if the game would have stuck for me when I began playing a few years ago if I couldn't catch up somehow. I saw all the cool things my friends were doing and I wanted to do those things too, but the SP barrier is extremely obvious early on, and as much as you can contribute in some ways it is still very pronounced in what you just cannot do without injecting.
---
I understood it as some kind of complex like in FW you have to take.
---
I suggested the same thing with Triglavians and was called retarded.
---
r/Eve in a nutshell.
---
Give it a week.
---
The AI will adapt and then refuse to undock.
---
It sounded to me like that comment was the writer repeating something CCP said to him. If so, I don't mind - it *is* CCP's game I was memeing about there anyway, and I don't really care *that* much about asserting ownership of a 10-minute-effort shitpost. I'm just amused someone at CCP apparently found it funny.
---
I almost quit the game because I though all there is to it is vni  ratting/exploring and f1 fleets. Then I joined a wh corp and i fell in love with the game

These are just games from my Steam library that I play regularly or have played regularly that I know off the top of my head have dev teams which communicate regularly with their players. Several of those games have weekly devblogs they publish to keep the community appraised of the changes and improvements they propose to make, and most take critique and feedback from the community into consideration when making updates and adding content. Almost all of those developers consistently acknowledge the community as crucial to their games' success.

CCP doesn't want to serve its audience. It wants its audience to serve it.
---
It doesn’t end PvP wars. 
---
It does mean you can’t leave your entire space completely undefended while you attempt to glass another region for giggles.
---
Not to put too fine a point on it but you *are* posting in r/eve.
---
Joining a large new player group is probably your best bet. Brave Newbies, Brand Newbros, etc
---
It changes the entire basis of my statement.
---
As far as I'm aware, they have, this far, only attacked large guys.
---
&gt; It doesn’t end PvP wars.
---
If it didn't literally end a war yesterday you might have a point.
---
No idea, you’d probably have to go look up EVE Down Under 2019 to get details.

---
Yup, let me just buy this real quick for all my accounts while ccp "transitions" this over to new player offers.
---
Honestly having null space reset would be nice.
---
Calm down, give it a bit of time. They made a mistake and are actively working to fix it.
---
They also put their infantry in front of their defensive line, with only small chokepoints for retreat ~~if~~ **when** they would become overwhelmed. They did not prepare the ground with, for example, pre-sighted range markers for their archers (something which *Ramsey fucking Bolton* did for chrissakes). They fought outside their castle (you know, the thing *designed to withstand a siege*) instead of reinforcing the walls, preparing pitch, etc. Their main air support, which is *devastatingly* effective, is used like twice.
---
I'm no more qualified than any other airmchair general, but the mistakes in that episode just kept piling the fuck up.
---
There's nothing stopping players from shooting them.

Whether that's intentional or just sampling bias remains to be seen.

I've also been banned from EVE.
---
PVCCP. FML.
---
Wow thank you. 😀😀😀
---
You are forgetting that the drifters eventually showed up and killed both fleets.
---
Thank you.  I always enjoy watching your videos, and I learn something every time.
---
I know where you're going with that. I lol'd.
---
It didn’t. 
---
Mittens realized his home might be in danger from his Maximum Damage campaign on the other side of the map.
---
So he decided to call it off and go south to defend his home just like Sir Molly’s before him when Band of Brothers tried their Maximum Damage campaign in the north.
---
Mittens had a choice, he could have left half the fleet in the north to continue fighting. He decided on a full retreat.
---
That is why this change is so awesome. It introduces risk the citadel spam had removed or vastly diminished. It forces the leaders in charge to make choices with consequences.
---
Yeah, have some highsec slip into being lowsec occasionally.
---
Just removing Concord but leaving it highsec would be an issue of clarity of information.
---
Maybe it's time for dynamic security
---
Except there is no asset safety... This is apples and oranges.
---
That takes someone special to pull this off
---
First of all, it was 500k sp. [https://www.eveonline.com/ru/article/pocsim/skillpoint-compensation-delivered-for-chat-system-issues](https://www.eveonline.com/ru/article/pocsim/skillpoint-compensation-delivered-for-chat-system-issues)   
---
Second, we just had an event not so long ago that handed out 1,25 million skillpoints to everyone who managed to login for 16 days, not to mention multiple SP handouts of 50-100k sp that came before that over the last year.
---
I don't have it to hand but there was an article written by a ROTC guy that absolutely dumped all over it from a great height... so trainee armchair general hated it :)
---
A bigger, *redder*, boat
---
It never was.
---
It was always $15 for subscription, 1 month game time in Plex for $20
---
It still is.
---
They just split 1 Plex into 500
---
Can you un-censor that please? I don't know what he's saying!
---
&gt; This means that soon the pack won’t be available to the wider community via the DLC page on secure.eveonline.com and will only be offered to new players as part of the account creation and onboarding process.
---
Literally saying 'hurry up and go buy them on your old accounts before you can't anymore'
---
No random twitch thot would waste time playing this game for more than 3 days
---
Eve has always had titty streamers, but they usually have beards, a basic understanding of the game, and voices that don’t make me yearn for self-immolation.
---
He got tackled on an athanor or tat and almost died
---
As far as I could tell from this post is that drifters are not blue to PH
---
Can you play this race in the game?
---
Thank you, I needed this laugh on my break at work.  It got me good :)
---
I bet you guys think you're so good beating up on a group that can't fight back. Makes a lot of sense why rasta would join such a bad alliance like yours. Why don't you come to Tama for a real fight.
---
So there was a war.  Then this happened.  And now there isn't a war.  And you are seriously contending that this doesn't end wars.  I knew r/eve was full of mouth breathing retards but you might take the cake.
---
I run small gangs with a core of pvpers in dreddit. Anything else is more people to shoot.
---
Not having overwhelming guarantees of success! How will the poor dears cope?
---
Ll...your words don't make sense.
---
Wouldn't you WANT them to judge success based on pvp kills?
---
&gt;More alliances, more coalitions.
---
Who doesn't. Now tell me where the fuck you are going to find the people? Even with all the rental space, nullsec is way too fucking big for the current playerbase already. You can fit the biggest coalition into 1 1/2 regions already. If there was any serious group, they could take space right now, without any issues. The problem with more people in 0.0 isn't the rental empires, it's the player count.
---
And even if you get rid of the "renters", you'll just get more pseudo renters.
---
Yeah that statement is very reminiscent of the old NC/PL back when they knew how to undock for fights more than once a week. Too bad that doesn't exist anymore.
---
Credit to you somehow made those serious stubborn drifter faces hilarious
---
CCP way of saying "Citadels were a mistake"
---
I'm not sure a single Twitch streamer picking up the game counts as "this level".
---
Did you see the skin that ship was wearing?
---
wow neat
---
Yup.
---
So we can't really make judgements just yet.
---
There may be a method of target selection to ensure these don't kick out the little guys. If they made it public it would be too easy to game too quickly, but if it does exist, hopefully it's related to activity in some way and not simply number of systems held.
---
I do, I'm suggesting that an event like this will reduce PVP conflict, and that they're instead measuring success by login numbers forced by these timers.
---
FW uses this technique already. The idea is to bring back smaller fleets and utilize all the various hulls. Fleets can attack 1 TCU or hit them all  at once.
---
I want a new race.
---
Somehow I don't think she is actually playing. Just playing a video in the background.
---
You don't have one, stop lying
---
Woah she's so good that she can even play the game while using both hands to fix her hair or type stuff something somewhere not in-game!
---
Ditto
---
It's also gonna have T2 or Navy mods as it's an Empire ship, no pirate or CONCORD mods allowed.
---
But you said in your comment "I hope they're not judging success by pvp kills"?
---
Where's the complication? Small, Med, Large TCU. This brings back subcaps and small fleet roams.
---
I don't think it's unreasonable to ask for mechanics changes that make player conflicts more numerous and more bloody, rather than mandatory pve fleets with no rewards.
---
This is less to do with EVE and more to do with Twitch, which has basically become Chaturbate with trousers on at this point.
---
Drifters seem like an excellent way to combat botters, since rats don't show up in local!
---
Or do get sucked in if that's your thing. I have thoroughly enjoyed it and learned a fuckton from being in one. There's no shame in literally anything here.
---
You're just used to 100 man fleets with doctrine fits shooting a structure for hours. This idea gives small fleets objectives to do in enemy space. Something that has been missing for a long time.
---
oof. Hull pen are a joke, sit down please
---
Yeah, and they won't once you've tediously ground their fleet in to wrecks for the 7th time this week like some kind of shitty daily quest.
---
CCP is trying to retain new players. Not throw them into bullshit engagements as cannon fodder and burn thru whatever little assets they have after the tutorial.
---
here u dropped this: /s
---
Netflix would finance the project. CCP has a great universe to expand to TV but they really need to try it. The game may be kind of niche, but the lore on it is a goldmine for those people who like space and sci-fi stuff.
---
No idea what this means but I upvoted just because of the laugh.
---
Don’t think he cares
---
I wish CCP Mimic would play with me, that would make me super hard!
---
Yeah, sarcasm sometimes flops over text.  I don't claim to be a master wordsmith
---
There was a war. 
---
CCP changes the behavior of some NPCs.
---
The CFC panicked and went into full retreat choosing to end the war.
---
The change did not end the war. Mittens deciding a full retreat was in order did as CFC's space was completely undefended ended the war.
---
The fact that you are first crying about this as hard as you are speaks volumes about you as a player.
---
As someone with direct family members who are special needs, the fact that you utilized such an insult speaks volumes about your worth as a human being ... or lack there of.
---
And you start whining about it just now? They've been selling similar packs since 2017.
---
Thanks for providing a distraction from the drifters bullshit
---
I have to watch his videos muted if i bother.
---
Fact is most people will say "fuck it" and quit because of the SP system and the insanity of catching up. The system outdated, annoying, and bad. Sadly changing it at this point would piss off those who benefit from it - the old players and the whales who spend even thousands of dollars/euros/etc for their SP - and thus likely will never happen.
---
But if the SP system is to remain in place, new characters should have WAY more SP to start with despite the amount having been boosted in the past - originally you could start with at least as little as 50-60k or so. And far more of a training boost that slows down gradually.
---
Additionally, character attributes - INT, PER, etc - and by association attribute-boosting implants should be removed. They're just an unnecessary hassle - which also incidentally hampers newer players more than old ones since old players just skip training times with injectors if they're rich - whether ISK-rich or IRL-money-rich - or are training a bunch of long skills with certain attributes rather than shorter skills from across the repertoire like a new player does.
---
Why did you hurt me like this?  I was so excited until you had to go and ruin it.
---
I will never trust again.
---
The POD Saver tab preset.
---
They care so much, they'll break promises to us for a quick cash grab.
---
&gt; They could mine and make enough ISK to fly that Hulk they wanted (and buy the permit for it too).
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; They could fly into a wormhole, get lucky by looting millions of ISK and then get the shakes as they narrowly avoid getting blown up by the residents.
---
&gt; They could capture the plex in FW that led the system win that caused the tide to turn.
---
&gt; They could even gank Freighters in Jita with a bunch of chill bros.
---
This is all still possible though, what are you even trying to say?

Well nuts to that. Our fat greed will never stop.

---
This has always been the "endgame story" of Eve. It's the old-style Jovian invasion we've been waiting since 2004
---
Here's what will happen.
---
You Just have to grind a few more red crosses each day than you did previously.
---
There won't be much if any chaos. And unless you have a Corp big enough to muster the critical mass of pilots to grind said red crosses you can get fucked if you want to own any 0.0 space.
---
Ironicly this was said by a imperium brodcast at the start of the war.
---
"You can burn all our citadels down while we are away from home it matters not, we have already won EvE and anything broken can be replaced. We wont come back until the jobs done."
---
You just want a tab with all hackable items on it really. And neutrals too I suppose. You should really look up the various guides on editing your overview, even if you're just modifying an existing one like the Z-S overview.
---
Also if you haven't already, read up on MWD+cloak trick, crashing gates, and using d-scan.
---
&gt;the new player experience needs improvement not new players getting more SP
---
&gt;Falcon - it’s something that’s on our radar for sure
---
Oh boy, time for the bi-annual line about how the NPE is a focus and as usual no real community feedback will be taken.
---
It can literally be done in 27.5 hrs if you plan it. Besides, I'll take more fun over what you call "longer". Right now, tell me what a 10 man fleet of frigs/destroyers can do in enemy space besides make people dock up?
---
**T**hat

**H**oe

**O**ver

---
I'm glad they are finally doing something with the drifters although I hope we get more lore insight into what is going on over the coming weeks.
---
Who's this retard and who is responsible for not shadowbanning him?
---
I hope they're trying to do a full reset.
---
I've no stake in it since I'm not really in 0.0 at least at the moment, but I can see both sides... on the other hand it seems cool and I'm all for lore-driven stuff (as frankly player wars are mostly just boring politics or ego "story"-wise). But yet it's also problematic doing such a big paradigm shift practically unannounced. It's especially problematic due to real money being such a factor in the game's economy now. Like "great, my $150 supercarrier was RKO'd to shit by some ganker NPCs outta nowhere". Then if you're extra lucky, podded on top. If you KNEW this could happen, you could act accordingly, but this indeed caught pretty much everyone with their pants down.  
---
Also like the PCGamer article interviewee said, NPCs don't have real lives and jobs and such to worry about to balance things out in such a conflict, they don't stand to lose thousands of manhours of effort on a whim, while the players and their corps/alliances do.
---
No, like, explain about the different ships and what they're good for each. Allow Gallente players to pick from pursuing a range of ships, Talos, Brutix, Exequror, Vexor, Thorax, Celestia, and teach them this ship will eventually die but they've achieved perfect skills in it and can just purchase it again. The missions of the Noob Arc would be more about providing new players an easily accessible way to fast forward to having a 5-6 mil SP toon that can then progress further from that foundation. It's about making them warm the skill points by playing.
---
I think you give him a lot of credit he may not deserve. Even a blind squirrel finds an acorn every so often.
---
Agreed, attributes are awful. And the rest of what you wrote is honestly why the new DLC pack, if restricted to new characters, is pretty great. So now I don't know what you're getting at cause it seems like you're arguing for both sides?
---
Inviting anyone to their home region for a ~real fight~ are tryhards fyi
---
Thanks dude!
---
I'll have a look into it!
---
The simplest and easiest way is to name five corgis after each of the five biggest BS entities, then feed them chocolate and go for whichever one’s corgi dies first.
---
Ok
---
Am I willing to grind yet more red crosses? Probably not. If I wanted to do more pve grinding, I'd go and do it in a game with half decent pve.
---
I believe however that this might not effect those with smaller sov territory. The sprawling empires in sov space will have issues but the Goons... well they do not have such a small space do they, just rich...
---
Thats okay. They talked about wiping the server anyways so~ what would make you more pissed. Watching it all fall apart slowly or waking up one day to see the entire server restarted
---
There are more widely-known space/scifi universes that don't really get the chance on the screen, or that get canned despite being good. Add to this the fact that movies derived from video games are rarely good or successes, and you can see why investors may not exactly jump at the chance with EVE. The Witcher TV series is upcoming but even that is based on the books, not the games - though the huge popularity of the games is probably a big drive behind the project.
---
I'd LOVE to see a great EVE TV series. I really would. But it's just such an unlikely occurence when keeping the realities of business in mind. We need super-advanced/sentient AI and quantum-level computing where you can just feed it a script and it makes a realistic CGI TV adaptation out of it in a hurry, then we can have movies/series about anything! ;)
---
Tfw your meme suddenly gets plopped into an actual news article
---
Nice one mate 👍
---
I hope it all burns to every satellite structure that was anchored and forgotten. Eve should not be about proliferation
---
Citadel spam is aids
---
Please don't. It was me being a bad capsuleer. Genuinely though, when it comes to overviews, take a look into  Z-S Overview. Basicallh everyone uses it and you can right click on each tab to hotswap presets for each activity.
---
For exploration you'll probably mostly be concerned with not getting blown up by player pirates. Check out some stuff on using your D-Scan and be ready to warp if you're in lowsec.
---
We definitely need context here...
---
Neither, if the end result is to wipe out 16 years of progress in both situations I'll just go and play a good game.
---
Eve only retains me as a player because of what I've accumulated in the last decade. It doesn't retain me as a player because it's a good game, because it's not that good compared to what else is out there.
---
Truth. The best part of this is that now we get to see just how adapated and advace CCP has been able to augment their AI after 16 years of work.
---
Just think the Matrix is tomorrow!
---
In short.

My eve account &gt; a fresh account in any other game &gt; a fresh account in eve.
---
If you don't already have it, you can get the Z-S overview by joining the channel "Z-S Overview" in game. It has instructions in the MotD and links to all the presets.
---
If you want it, come and take what you want :)
---
By the Triglavians, this is apparent not only in the lore releases, but the patch notes as well.
---
Absolutly right! It lost its zeal awhile ago. I felt the same way. Objects still in asset safety.
---
Abnormal would be happy to have you!
---
I honestly tried Civilization, it's just so goddamn boring. Nothing ever happens. Like at all. It's just watching octagons pretend they're building a building or whatever.
---
What Q and A? There is always some idiot suggesting it, but there will never be one so we laugh them out of the room. I didn't realize people thought those threads are anything more than a good honeypot thread.
---
That's because it's not such a simple issue. From a personal point of view I'd prefer a proper overhaul. But I can see why they'll likely never, ever do that, especially considering most of their monetization is centered around the SP system - Omega, injectors, extractors, etc. And the new DLC pack - no, the new player probably won't see it as great. They will see it as pretty much mandatory, a sign of the P2W nature of the SP system, and leave. Maybe not at first glance, but soon enough.
---
Then again the entire game could use an overhaul. I wanted proper free flight 13 years ago, and I sure don't want it any less now. If Star Citizen delivers even a fraction of what it is supposed to, I don't see my return to EVE lasting at least beyond that, if it lasts long at all. Already all the ISK grinding and real money aspects are starting to really be a drag, and I've only been back for 3 weeks.
---
Lol mittens is such a bitch. 
---
"Buh huh muh titan blob got interrupted by actual interesting content"
---
Holy shit I'm upvoting horde
---
Ask yourself a question. Why aren't all renters just straight up joining Goons? It's safer right? Not exactly hard to join.
---
 I don't think you truly understand how easy corms are to fly.
---
#&lt;&lt;THIS TWISTED GAME NEEDS TO BE RESET&gt;&gt;
---
And you are still addicted. You will never defeat your addiction as long as you are here spouting off nonsense.
---
Google the CCP dev blog about how to fix EvE and you will find it. They spoke about wiping the server and had talked about wiping the server to fix the game. However thats not exactly realistic due to the player investment and had asked for input. This likely is the end result of that.
---
Says the guy aspiring to be Stainguy...
---
Technically, Thera isn't a wormhole because it isn't in Anoikis. It is just a unique k-space system with lots of wh connections.
---
&gt; One can't help but wonder at the timing of this.
---
It's almost if they came out of nowhere. Not due to a recent expansion that has been teasing the conflict between a new race, that are fighting against Drifters and Sansha's. All of which live in unknown parts of space, that now all seemingly converge to New Eden proper.
---
More or less how most of the guyd ive flown with felt. We all retired like 3 months ago but keep up with events. If the server wipe happened it was almost unanimous that we would come back and start over. But again decade of money getting eaten blackhole style would be a huge middle finger to the player base as well.
---
Eve is now a linear progression game, sorry bud
---
Funny thing: back when the Drifters were first introduced, they were podding people on SISI completely not by design - people loved it so much that CCP (after figuring out the cause) incorporated it into their regular behavior~~
---
The reward is keeping your shit, the same as a player war reward. Have less shit in space and you'll have less to worry about
---
LMFAO
---
Not exactly, but your dick will become necrotic and rot off eventually.
---
goons just did that to a coupe regions : let's unsub
---
npc do it : let's resub

Should I get you some Bristol board and some sharpies, you could make a sign and let everyone know?
---
Then just make one for us-
---
It wouldn't piss me off if they did that so much as remove all motivation I have to continue playing. What keeps bringing me back to eve again and again over the years is the time and money I put into my characters. Take that away and I really don't have anything to come back for, the PVE in this game is about as mindless and boring as it gets and the thought of either needing to grind out a new fortune in some form of PVE or spend even more money buying one through PLEX while rebuilding 10 + years of character training is completely unappealing to me at this point.
---
:blazeit:
---
&gt;This idea gives small fleets objectives to do in enemy space. Something that has been missing for a long time.
---
That's what fozzie sov was supposed to do, all it did was result in 100 man fleets doing something in enemy space. Your version has the same stupid mechanics as the current version of sov, its just designed to be more obnoxious.
---
Dave doesn’t like anything. Don’t get too drawn into it.
---
1 month should be a good intro,  personally I always went 3 months at a time but given how long I stuck around probably should have just gone for a years worth. 
---
I've been around long enough I have no problem just paying for my sub with in game isk,  like some have said a year is a pretty good amount of time to get to self sufficient but also if you do stick around and play that much it might just be worth subbing again.  
---
It's very much a can vs should you question that only you can answer, and with a year of experience you should be well informed.
---
All the Drifters want is your heart.
---
People will probably just become NRSI.  Not Red Shoot It
---
holy fuck didnt know that
---
I was thinking of something similar but the only difference I have is that the clash between the two will be in low sec.
---
I say this only due to Triglavians originating in high sec (from how it appears I may be wrong) and the drifters appear to be originating in null sec.
---
Triglavians are that very thing...
---
With insurance and SRP, newbros won't lose much, and they will gain experience. Joining one of the larger new player corps is the best way to go, by far.
---
I started playing yesterday. I had no idea what was going on then and I have even less of an idea now.
---
I really don't understand the excitement people are expressing here on reddit, this isn't adding content to the game in the traditional sense. This has not resulted in players killing players, or getting to exploit the timers set by the new rats, or getting to third party fights against drifters as the drifters would just shoot them too. The game is essentially playing itself and people can see the results on zkillboard, how is that "content"?
---
for normal people it is accounting magic, and that is all we need to know.
---
\&gt; Asset safety is Eve putting training wheels on a motorcycle and paving the roads with cotton candy. You literally can't lose.   
---
Beautifully put &lt;3
---
Fuck that. Player orgs are hardly punishing one another. Even a full region wipe by one org against another isn't doing enough. Eve needed something more serious. This is hopefully it.
---
It is hard to fix, but that's why we have to talk about it at least. You're literally the only person in this entire thread that actually makes valid points. Thank you for that.
---
Nothing stopping NPCs from shooting them either it seems.
---
z-s overview channel in game 
---
sarashawa-overview channel in game   
---
SaraShawa is easier to customize and updated faster. Z-S is prettier but if you change it it will explode on you.
---
It still is though.
---
Bombers are n+1 still.  You need X to bomb a Y ship.  They are artificially soft-capped by bomb's self-damage.  
---
Smart-bombers are also n+1.  They are also soft-capped by self-damage.  
---
Bosons and Lances are also n+1.  They are also soft-capped by self-neuting.  
---
I don't really have a point here with this one, other than perhaps 'soft caps are good, hard caps are bad'.
---
Oh shit they pod.
---
+V2
---
I considered that possibility, but then I figured that CCP probably wants players to actually engage in the content and nobody's going to traipse out to lowsec for that shit.
---
Thank you for your insightful opinion, I'm sure your pve corp will utilise it to the fullest of its lack of abilities
---
I think you mistake communicating at you to communicating to you. Of all the shit I can say about CCP, not communicating with the players is not one of them. Just because people want to whine because CCP doesn't respond right away to a ticket are pretty fucking entitled. I would rather investigate the issue and give a proper response than respond right away and possibly misstate something. Especially to this community who tries to space lawyer everything that anybody says.
---
Are you baby back bitches really going to keep droning on about that? Jesus you're the biggest fucking whiners  I have ever seen. To be such hardcore space nerds, you fuckers pout an awful lot
---
Lmao wiping the game and still having skill injectors in 
---
Tbh CCP should just rework the whole skill system and just have it to where you can fly every ship but have to have skills for the bonuses
---
I reached out to CCP Games personally, and a spokesperson said they "reached out to the Drifters for comment, but they rejected our hailing frequencies."
---
 
---
The rest of the context. And yeah CCP essentially took his shit post and ran with it as a sort of joke/lore/meme from the way it reads.
---
That's just it. There aren't 'efficient' ways to off them. You can go at them with large numbers in disposable ships, or with fewer but more expensive capitals and supers. 
---
They just have to be killed, there's no way to really go about it with no risk or even little risk unless you do something gimmicky like 100mn MWD munnin and shoot from beyond their range.
---
Hell no!!!!!! Sandbox games should not have a main quest and give every player the same story line!
---
I generally expect people to keep their promises. Ccp aren't an exception to that reasonable standard.

Oh no my delicate sensibilities i'm withering away ahhhh.
---
Oh wait no i'm not. Go fuck yourself.
---
How do you propose this.
---
Citadels are the size of a fucking moon.
---
It's even more confusing after the years of constant "grrr worthless krabs grrr"
---
I thought some marauders could solo one?
---
https://zkillboard.com/related/30000819/201906272000/
---
Easily my favorite.
---
One small factor to remember 'if' drifters cleared space this would set alliances like goons who you so desire to see get destroyed further ahead, having only rebuilt fairly recently and certainly a lot more recently than any other major alliance rebuilding they will have a good organisation and structure in place to resettle the space.
---
Also in terms of drifters what will happen if say goons defend it,  panfam can't now you have a situation where one alliance is lightyears ahead of all others and you have an even larger disparity 
---
Anyone who thinks 'drifters wiping space' is a good idea really hasn't thought of the end result very much
---
AFK ratting not affected at all. Drifter doesn't attack VNI on ratting site
---
Thanks!
---
It is easier to balance incentive than put artificial blocks in, regardless, I don't even believe the issue lies in titan numbers or necessarily cyno mechanics.
---
The issue is combat ranges I now believe.  Eve needs another 'great speed rebalance', but this time in terms of Maximum combat range, and guns sizes range and tracking.
---
For the size of goons their actual space is incredibly small, as a result if any alliance has a good chance of defending it would be them, because if they buckle down and just defend delve  it would likely be fine, renter space losses will hurt other alliances far more
---
Alternately it may refer to an attempt to re-open the EVE gate causing a second catastrophic collapse and releasing a massive shockwave of energy that propagates through the gate network devastating the cluster.
---
Pretty sure there are already some killmails of ratting carriers being killed.
---

I love that they are also saying it will cause more content when all its done is forced every war to stop so their people can go back and shoot rats?
---
Ultimately stopping all conflict and forcing people to turtle in their own space
---
#Execute Order 66
---
No, CCP should be selling skillpoints.  I want packs all the way up to 100m skill points for $500. Let's fucking go.
---
who would win? one cyborg dude or one suit boi?
---
More importantly, they wouldn't pay you.
---
The whole skill system is bullshit.
---
Make the game requiring an active subscription again and get rid of skills/skillpoints --&gt; great game where mostly player skill matters. 
---
If that means a lot of noobs would sit in supers/capitals, fine more things that die quick.
---
I think their definition of content, and ours, varies wildly.
---
Like asking an American and a brit what pants are, or chips.
---
&gt;too  
---
&gt;in addition; also.
---
&gt;"is he coming too?"
---
This I prefer.
---
Yeah, this is one of the coolest things to happen to EVE in the last few years, if they can keep it going aka ensure it doesn’t get defeated by a gimmick I’ll be really excited to see where it goes. I definitely hope they ignore the naysayers and stay on track here, since this has the potential to shake up a lot of the meta.
---
If the US and the USSR have nukes, and you need nukes to compete.  How do you exist without their benevolence?
---
Eve does not have a UN.
---
Exactly, this starts to provide a way to limit the size of empires without having weird gimmicks like a system cap that can be easily avoided.
---
Or it's a shitty bandaid because citadel mechanics/asset safety are so fucking cancerous that CCP had to send NPCs because they couldn't incentivize the attacker enough.
---
You obviously never got into faction war.
---
Go batphone another alliance to evict a c3 lol
---
I think my favourite part of the most uninteresting war eve has ever seen was the excessive use of the word glass.
---
Think of them mildly like Eve scout. But more profit driven
---
What movie is this from?
---
I spent almost a year in fac war.
---
Awesome print. Why I’m 15 years have you not gotten a megatheon if its your dream ship?
---
They have fucking doomsdays. On battleships.
---
Strange... you just not have learned anything.
---
With whom are you proposing they fight in Tama for a “real” fight?
---
Runescape interacts with a larger player base more regularly,  both daily twitter and in weekly QA
---
Reporting in: Wingspan guided him to his new hole today. So far everything looks good.
---
This is the part I find really confusing, every summer there is a player dip, this year there is a pair of wars to offset that dip and they decide to drop a mechanic that ends them both and sends everyone how to shoot rats, its like they want to kill the server population.
---
Sometimes I wonder what goes through somebodies tiny midget brain when they make posts like this. 
---
Like let's say somehow magically renting is made illegal tomorrow and all the rental alliances are banned. The day after, somebody opens a new alliance that simply charges alliance shes, and who is protected by a larger group. 
---
That actually exists right now in game but you're so fucking dumb all you can manage is HERP A DERP RENTERS GUYS.
---
You will only ever see LESS diversity and coalitions in 0.0, not more.
---
the only content this has really generated is posting killmails on reddit of people dying to drifters in blinged out shit.
---
So your argument is literally 'It didn't end the war.  Everyone just stopped fighting the war because of it'.
---
Just an FYI, when the mailman gives you your mail, he is not 'allied with you'.
---
Spoken like someone who started in 2014 or some shit.
---
The great nullsec empires used to be funded by level 4 missions.
---
I learned it was boring which is why I got out of it.
---
Get rid of skills...
---
pretty sure the Hel that died 2 hours before the nid was the first cap to die.
---
Asset Safety is a good thing, if im on vacation an my Alliance Citadel gets canned...its bullshit I lose stuff. This is why old stations were sweet. You can sell your shit, or like many time in the past, take a station just because it has a bunch of peoples shit in it.
---
Citadels are just fucking cancer and have ruined everything but hi-sec.
---
Tethering....that is what should be getting removed but nah they just doubled down on it.
---
CVA, go figure.
---
I didn't mistake it. The games listed had dev communication with players where they would actually talk to each other.

CCP puts gate to lowsec in stain, and not 3 seconds after it anchored drifters blew it up.
---
I'm mad at the prospect of game content being modelled after such a horribly pathetic villain.
---
Because pandemic is easier to join
---
Lmao this is gold
---
Stay mad.
---
I know.
---
I guess a 30,000 plus member Coalition could not figure out how deal with new NPCs and still carry on with a largely uncontested invasion. 
---
Welp, new meta is here and guess CFC will have to learn before the next Maximum Damage attempt.
---
Except SirMolle bailed to respond to actual players. Mittens was forced to bail, because of NPCs.
---
They shouldn't shoot structures....unless its a HiSec clean up crew to clean up all the offlined Citadel shit everywhere.
---
'09 but.. thanks? Never ran L4s
---
Took a year? Doesn't say much about how quickly you perceive things. 
---
Just give up Goonturd. I hope a Drifter pops your ratting super carrier
---
Good, let's take away hi sec stations and see what they say next.
---
Almost like CCP wanted to shrink Empire control......then fucked it up with Citadels.
---
SirMolle also had to respond because of the differences in structure conquest mechanics at the time.
---
Now you have the safety of time zone tanked citadel vulnerability timers and proliferation that result in being able to leave your space undefended with relative safely.
---
That just changed.
---
paint time! Gonna give it the gallente standard, or.. what skin? :D
---
jokes on you I rat in a carrier
---
If staying home n killing rats is what will bring you back to the game, then do I have news for you!  You can rat all day every day already!
---
&gt; 12Bill skills

hax
---
There's always going to be NPC stations in game in every area(except wormholes). You have no real way to remove them without removing some very fundamental game systems. Where would you have mission HUBs or NPC buy and sell orders? NPCs are an integral part of every MMO for a reason, you can't design every game system to rely only on players. 
---
Stop with the false analogy
---
Fun fact drifters.can be very good money makers, pop them with cheap throw away ships and salvage for blue loot win win it comes to our door step and reddit is cheering ccp for it. 
---
What a day to be alive
---
&gt;Normally, sieges in EVE Online can take up to 12 hours or more, but these Drifters are so powerful they're tearing through defenses in a matter of minutes.
---
Heh
---
I admire your enthusiasm.
---
I've been winning Eve for a couple years, are you telling me they got rid of the Sisters of Eve Epic Arc?
---
I'm baffled.
---
This is the dick measuring i can get behind.
---
That is exactly what happened.
---
There were a multitude of choices before Mittens. He has a 30,000 plus member coalition with the largest super capital / titan fleet in the game to work with in order to finish a largely uncontested invasion that already took out the main staging.
---
He could have divided his forces via alliances.
---
He could have divided his forces via sigs.
---
He choose to take all 30,000 plus of his coalition home to deal with the new NPCs.
---
The convocation of Triglav shall enter the plains of Dejan to extripate the ancient enemy Azdaja and remove the corruption of the poshlost from corrupting the flow of vyraj.
---
In English, the trigs are gonna go to wh space and kill the drifters and rid there degenerate influence from abyssal space
---
Yeah they kills carrier and supercarrier but not afk ships :) . you cannot afk with carriers
---
I'd rather see a server wipe than deal with the Goons whining about Drifters blowing up their ratting carrier.
---
-Sad robot noises-
---
He also said that the whole AI enhancement journey started with the Drifters 5 years or so ago. Basically when Toronto was over is when the drifters attacked.
---
Probably a little CCP celebration on their achievements in AI.
---
Player 2 has entered the game
---
He would need more bees on his head.
---
If an alliance has space to rent, that just means that no one is powerful enough to come and take the space away.
---
What I read here is "I'm too shit/antisocial/apathetic to go take the space, so I want CCP to invent NPC mechanics that will take their space away from them."
---
Nobody does, because this is the internet and you're irrelevant
---
They have to krab anoms for a while first.
---
thanks for the update mate, really appreciate it. take the time you need to do a job you're happy with by all means. looking forward to reading them
---
alright thanks for the tips guys, i just repurchased my astero, hopefully thanks to those tips i can avoid taking any more bad hits to my bank so i can afford a new month of omega soon!
---
Dreamstrider IV is ready to fly!
---
If only :(
---
You sound like a guy that’s never written code that interacts with eves ESI.
---
Well now im going to be dissapointed unless this actually happens
---
Ccplease
---
which will stop in a few days once people know an undocumented change has been pushed live and was apparently intended, as they will react accordingly.
---
Grown valley girls are ugly.
---
Time to FIRE THE GAME BACK UP AFTER A YEAR, this shots getting interesting
---
&gt;for the first time in the game's history actual PvP warfare was interrupted by a glorified world event
---
He's not wrong tho
---
One thing I always thought this game needed was roaming NPC characters.  Have some serpentis roam high sec, a little fleet with with logi and e-war.  Have caldari faction npcs sworm gallente low sec.  This is a nice little addition that they added that is in this direction.
---
Hopefully the start nuking Titans &amp; Supers..
---
Good thing they already made bank off it, now that they’re removing it even more people will buy it as a “limited time offer”
---
Fuck CCP
---
Whats the payout like on the drifters ?
---
Hopefully they start nuking titans &amp; supers...
---
This is my surprised face...
---
All speculation because CCP is (awesomely) keep things close to their chest.
---
That being said I hope this AI is an indication that an upgrade will happen across all NPCs and you will start to get more and more interactions just like your indicating.
---
Is he? Were they actually forced to do anything? What stopped them from continuing what they already were doing?
---
&gt; What stopped them from continuing what they already were doing?
---
a  large amount of npcs reinforcing structures in delve that need to be dealt with whack-a-mole style?
---
Yeh you can't AFK in CAPS. The Raven farmers appear to be safe still.
---
Tbh I wish CCP gave tools to players to do this rather than have NPCs doing it
---
I think he looked for reason to go home. Atleast it sounds like it.
---
its a bug
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77510502/ just now, 3,3b Paladin
---
Because goons don’t have jump-clones in Delve?
---
Lmao thinking one sided wars is what people sub for (neither was heating up to anything important tbh)
---
Know I love about PC gamer they dont know when people make up a meme sov map
---
unlike a certain group in the game, we care about our infrastructure.
---
With 0 info on whats up with the drifters, it's safer bet to go home and defend than have drifters make 200 timers and risk someone going in for the kill while supers are elsewhere.
---
It's their choice to respond, there is no coercion. They pick a particular playstyle and reap the benefits and drawbacks.
---
so if we're jump cloning to delve, how are we going to continue doing things in the north? we'd be back in delve.
---
Horde gives more skills books and ships than the tutorial. and unlimited refils of those frigates and destroyers.
---
Are we money matching this? I'm down.
---
The speed moveops started looked like it was already in motion, just not announced.
---
That's about 400 million light-years away from what I was suggesting. I suspect you're on drugs.
---
&gt; It's their choice to respond, there is no coercion.
---
yes there is, these npcs destroy structures. they don't just strip the shields then piss off.
---
it hardly takes more than 5 mins to cycle through a few subcaps and remove all non-ammo inventory items, then drag said subcaps in to a fleet hangar, and buy some fuel from the market window.
---
Yea 09 it was already winding down in favor of other re-balanced incomes that happened.
---
&gt; Tfw your meme suddenly gets plopped into an actual news article
---
I know, definitely a bit surreal, especially reading that it was there because someone at CCP sent it to them as an 'intercepted drifter transmission'. O.o It was just a ten minute shitpost lol!
---
What should a 2 week old noob do in all of this madness?
---
Basically null was made even safer than empire depending on how big a blue blob you joined. The drifters use NPC to dismantle that sense of safety so the players now need to field a home defense and an attack force. This change will take a little while to form a strategy over. Eventually the blobs will learn to live with the drifters around but until then they can't leave their infrastructures to bot alts with confidence. Null realized they became the 'carebears' they always complained about.
---
The pubbie cheering over this  is sad, saying it will generate content when all its done is stopped content dead in its tracks and forced all wars to stop while everyone needs to go home and rat..
---
What amazing engaging gameplay
---
Seems to me minimum wage went up but also so did rent and fuckin milk.
---

Just missing goon hate
---
i'm going to have to warn you about the dangerous territory you are entering.
---
you're defying the reddit narrative du jour, enter at your own risk.
---
Im not here to farm karma, if I was I'd put up a pandemic horde flare n make a topic called grr goons.. Infinite karma
---
Waaahhh CCP interrupted my structure bashing 
---
Literally htfu
---
in that case, venture forth my brave companion. godspeed.
---
the FRT/Test war has been pretty even so far, and as far as the north goes its hard not to have a one sided war when one side picks up their ball and runs 3 regions over to avoid the fight
---
Why is PvP specifically so important? Speaking personally, it'd be as much fun fighting competent NPCs as players if they provide the same challenge and surprise me every once-in-a-while; it'd be like the advanced AIs in real-time strategy games.
---
Mittani is treating CCP's in game events as if they are minor turdy annoyances on his own lawn which is a massive spaceship empire
---
I thought hitting structures was a great way to generate pvp content
---
join horde
---
yep. 
---
"WE NEED THE CASH INJECTION NOW GUYS, SO BUY THEM QUICK BEFORE WE TAKE THEM AWAY." - ccp 2019
---
how do you know that they didn't see you?
---
What a boring argument this will be I'll just say what you'll basically end up saying anyway
---
The North should just feed into us lmao
---
Darth Vader or the borg chic from Star Trek?
---
Invasion Triglavian NPCs are using specific modules to scan player owned structures, it is quite obvious NPC can do the bashing as soon as CCP replace those testing modules with real guns
---
Only if goons are not the ones hitting those structures. 
---
Fuck man get on the right narrative train here
---
They didn’t show up on my overview or anything like that. I was in a “high sec” area, got blown up for mining and then they tried to extort me for a mining license. I was in the middle of an asteroid field and the person who killed me messaged me asking how I liked my new ship
---
Calling others pubbies in 2k19
---
I wish I was this unselfaware
---
If you are willing to do a few hours of hi-sec incursions with Warp to Me, subbing with in-game isk is not difficult, cheers mate
---
generally speaking, when you lose a ship that information is made public.
---
also, they don't need to show up on your overview - ships can be cloaked so you can't see them - or they can be watching you from a different character entirely. also if you're in the middle of an asteroid field it's pretty obvious what ship you're going to be in.
---
You've just described 80% of Eve gameplay
---
Well pvp is dead now anyway long live the krabbing. drifters ftw
---
Okay, my venture got blown up and I switched to a corax that actually had weapons. I was looking in the last system I saw them in in my corax and they mentioned my new ship.
---
So CCP finally sees that a purely player-driven model of content generation produces boring risk-averse gameplay resulting in a static and dying world, and decides to spice it up by adding relatively unscripted and non-invincible NPC entities in order to drive more dynamic content generation.
---
And Goons want to go back to the old way, where everyone turtled in their stations and under their super umbrellas and nobody took any risks.
---
if you didn't change the name it will literally be called "R_Trader's Corax" - so, yeah...
---
Hello?
---
I like this idea, just have regional chat ONLY for null
---
wat
---
Okay, I know that I just didn’t think they were in my area so I didn’t know how they could have known unless they were tracking me somehow
---
they can see your ship name from 14AU away using directional scan.
---
The name of the ship shows on d-scan, which works while cloaked or from 14 AU away.
---
Oh okay, that must have been it. Thank you.
---
So plenty of options here:
---
1) They were on grid with you at some point even if you didn’t we them and saw your ship, maybe watched you die.
---
2) They were using D-scan, and noticed a venture turn into a capsule with your name on it.
---
3) They monitor that system on zkill which is a third party website with every killmail posted on it. 
---
4) They saw you in local and looked your character and saw you were new. Then later saw you warping out in a capsule, just put two and two together.
---
Probably other options...
---
EVE is hard and Goons don't like it.
---
Thanks so much that clears that up. I appreciate you all taking the time to explain basic stuff to me
---
&gt; Who doesn't. Now tell me where the fuck you are going to find the people?
---
It would require breaking up the bigger alliances and coalitions, which is going to take some serious game mechanic changes to incentivize people to do. Maybe as dramatic as NPC deathsquads invading everywhere and blowing up stuff.
---
PVE is hard?
---
It's probable they had a character who was not outwardly associated with them watching you in that system. Or, if you bought the Corax from them they could see that, but that's less likely.
---
Now reality: this has actually forced all pvp content to end, and now we need to go home and turtle and krab, while taking no risks to do so because there is no gain.
---
I don't want a large Farva
---
probably.
---
that's going to probably be the meta. when you have a ship that will 1 shot any ship you throw at it because apparently that's a good game mechanic.... you may as well throw the cheapest ships you can at it to get the job done.
---
sacrificial destroyers are going to be the solution, just like they were before ccp forgot about drifters to indulge triangle fetish.
---
Frat faces the same type of situation NC did, they decided to actually online the jammers they anchored and make use of home field advantage and its worked wonders for them. NC did that exactly one time this war, the first SH1 iHub timer, and it worked they shredded an a pair of sub fleets and the caps we had didn't even bother to try jumping into system because they had supers and titans on gate with sub caps fleets to lock it down. They didn't need to feed they just needed to show up and use the advantages built in to being the defender in a sov war and decided they didn't want to.
---
Itt people in carebearland telling people in null that they're too scared to use their big shiny stuff against npc's to prove that they aren't risk averse to people in carebearland.
---
Police skin!
---
Integer underflowed*
---
Guess they havent heard of dps caps. Or they chose to ignore them
---
If players can't clear an entity out of a nullsec area anymore, rats have to.
---
Ok cool, and how easy is it to track your specific location. Because they made it clear they’re going to continue to hunt me down if I keep mining

not sure why a samll gang leader would want to blue 75% of null players. you could come join Horde and shoot as many people in delve and esoteria as you want.
---
Great 2 weeks ago i thought i quit eve. CCP must have noticed and want to bring me back. Maybe this weekend.
---
My money is on the chick with the slim waste and big cybertiddies.
---
That's right, I watches Voyager. And I liked it god dammit.
---
Last time we fought drifters they literally just right click--&gt;delete item'd ships with their doomsday. Would you willingly suicide assets into a supposedly indestructable force or would you just tank the loss of the structure?
---
More like"i pay for this"
---
i think they did
---
If you have the resilience of moving a new character either in a pod or a rookie ship from starter system to whatever low/null/J space you need a scout
---
Then go ahead, my applause for your  commitment
---
I really don't know why you guys always come around with those strange thoughts. Let the people play the game how they want to. If it's their playstyle to rent space from a coalition that has enough resources to provide this space for a fee, let them be?
---
There are plenty of NPCs just out in space. You don't need a station for that. As for buy and sell orders, that can be done in space too, I've done plenty of trading to NPCs in space to rebuild reputation. 
---
Stop assuming you know everything.
---
&gt;They have fucking doomsdays. On battleships.
---
Feels kinda suicidy?
---
I’m not sure the “boring” war qualifies as a player vs player encounter. 
---
Seems to most people as this is just an excuse to go home as everyone was bored as fuck grinding structures.
---
I personally don’t blame them.
---
I've had it in game forever. I wanted it in real life.
---
***VEX ON THE FIELD***
---
That requires Locator Agents, or just keeping physical eyes on you. By the way, I wouldn't worry too much about these guys. Here's what you should do:
---
1. Add their corporation to your watch list with negative standings 
---
2. Pay attention to local chat to see when they're in system
---
3. Constantly be using directional scan (dscan) to assess who and what is around you
---
4. If someone comes onto your asteroid belt grid, leave immediately.
---
You're going to see a lot more t1 suicide metas because they 1 shot any sub cap this is the only real solution
---
Hmm... So when you're highsec structure get RF'd you'll be cheering "FU Highsec?" When YOU can't mission run, mine, or even safely jump anywhere but cower in an NPC station I'm sure you will be dancing in your seat going "this is SOOO AWESOME!!! DELVE IS GONE! THE FORGE IS GONE! EVERYTHING IS GONE! HOO RAA CCP LET'S DESTROY EVERYTHING BECAUSE IT'S... unpredictable?
---
Okay thanks so much I really appreciate it! I don’t think I would have died if I was paying closer attention but I had my mining lasers on and was watching Netflix and then I heard explosions that were not from the tv. It’s pretty fun
---
builds up the biggest krab empire in EVE. lets his alliance krab nonstop for the last 2+ years.
---
complains about pve ''content''
---
&gt; The Imperium was in the midst of prosecuting a war involving tens of thousands of real players.
---
Yes okay
---
There is absolutely nothing hard about fitting t1 suicide destroyers and defending structures,  boring yes, hard, no
---
This fallacious argument comes up over and over and over again and people thinking that it's somehow the real issue are asking for something that will make things worse, not better.
---
Nullsec is NOT too big. It's too consolidated.
---
EvE will finally become a meaningful abbreviation. Environment vs Environment.
---
The spirit of the rule is that only omegas can have more than one account logged in and doing things at a time. Therefore even if its not technically blocked doesn't mean its allowed.
---
For you, the day the Drifters graced your regions, leaving botters to die to rats, idiots getting shitcanned by NPCs and solo players with balls the size of trucks cashing in on the carnage as and where they can was the most important day of your life!
---
But for Syndicate...It was tuesday.
---
I know this might come as a surprise to you, the war of hypocrisy was not the only war happening at that time that has been ended, infact the other war the defenders even defended and had good fights
---
Would you rather pvp or pve?
---
Honestly I'd probably resub for that
---
Or it means the mega-alliance has things like supercap superiority and NIPs with the neighbors who would otherwise be threats to it.
---
Realistically taking sov off of an active megacoalition as an independent is basically impossible, much less trying to hold it after you somehow miraculously get it.
---
NPCs handling some of the ridiculous bloat is a good thing. If you really think what you've said is true then you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about and clearly have not tried life outside of a blob.
---
Yes.
---
Maxed for alpha skills would be fine as well
---
Except this thread is about the comments of the leader of one specific war. 
---
Try to keep up man. I know reading is hard
---
The best pvp is in lowsec mate. With no bubbles or bombs you can use battleships with shiny pods. Also as no one wants to traipse out to lowsec you rarely have tidi fights.
---
And it's easier to survive and learn when you're part of a large battle instead of solo or a small gang, where you're the only thing to shoot and every mistake counts.
---
Yes, solo and small gang generally take more skill and have a higher reward.  That's not what new players need.
---
Like many players who are no longer around, those Steve’s have gone on to bigger and better things. They’re probably playing WoW or FFXIV right now
---
i play with 1 omega just fine.
---
It a topic about a shit pve encounter destroying pvp engagements. I know the grr goons is strong but don't be blinded by it. Goons occupy a very small section of space with a very large force this will hurt all others far more than goons you'd be a fool to think otherwise
---
It's not so much that this is just what players alone should be doing. It's what hostile AI should *always* have been doing.
---
Upkeep and defence from the local elements should have always been a thing to the point that it wasn't even questioned. Better late than never, I guess.
---
and we call CCP dumb! They've played this perfectly :P
---
He means mining ships should be exempt from danger.
---
"The Imperium was in the midst of prosecuting a war involving tens of thousands of real players. We are annoyed that we have had to stop our player vs player warfare and grind through what amounts to World of Warcraft-style raid content”
---
I’ll just leave this here. Enjoy
---
Oh man I'll get omega and shit I ain't cheap  or nothin just curious on other points of view so I can better prepare myself
---
&gt; Dave doesn’t like anything.
---
there are a few things i like. it's a short list, but there is one.
---
hammer time?
---
\&gt; "If another player comes by and knocks down our sandcastle that's one thing," Dran adds. "Those risks are understood and part of the sandbox. We set up full well knowing the risks, and are prepared to fight anyone for our right to be here. We didn't set anything up knowing that at any point with no warning NPCs would materialize and blow everything up. NPCs don't sleep, they don't get tired, they don't have to wake people up or take off work to show up for a timer. They just exist one second, shoot, and then despawn. EVE is supposed to be a sandbox driven by human interaction and intrigue. This just feels contrived." 
---
Everyone involved should be ashamed for making fun of hisec carebears.
---
this one is a test print, so it'll get undercoat/primed and then probably a custom what-were-you-thinking Hello Kitty or some such.
---
Or get kids to let loose with paint pens.
---
I'll look into federation standard and police skin for the good PET-G prints.
---
and as a small entity, good fucking luck getting established if you don't have the critical mass to deal with drifters to begin with.
---
that's basically what they did with rigs, so it's not exactly a wild or unprecedented idea.
---
 "“The Invasion expansion will provide a new presence and dimension to gameplay in New Eden that will bring players back time and again, inspiring them to be a part of history unfolding, the effects of which promise to change the EVE universe forever,” CCP says in a press release
---
\&gt;Makes fun of hisec players for being carebears
---
\&gt;Cries like a bitch because npcs are adding risk back in nullsec
---
That's also my sabre gtfo tab. Can go wrong with drive by bubbling and warping to random celestials
---
True
---
Am I on this list?
---
So defend them and quit whining then. If its not worth it to defend them then they must not be critical enough.
---
i'm going to plead the 5th on that one.
---
Every Civilization game after Civ 4 is nowhere near as good as Civ 4.
---
&gt; Nullsec is NOT too big
---
When delve and a constellation in querious can sustain the by far up and away biggest coalition in the game, Nullsec is too big for the current player base.
---
You could either reduce the space itself, or just make it less "consolidated" by forcing people to spread out more, which effectively reduces the "space" as well. In the end it doesn't matter, if you cut half of nullsec out of the game or make players in nullsec need double the space. The percentage of space used per player needs to go up.
---
Until you stop tens of thousands of players, thousands of which are mega ultra krabs, from only taking up 0.04% of available space, you're not gonna change anything meaningful.
---
I am upset.
---
I bet that’s on your list
---
CCP decided that they give the LS gate to finally get Stainguy quiet. But first they are going to remove all other gates because stain is a horrible region anyways and noone wants to live there. Stain will then become the first K-Space only reachable via frigateholes and a single LS gate.
---
Its less the size ,ore the fact your siting there doing nothing but recycling  guns for a set time, just because they wanna give time to a defender thats never coming. I rather be able to nuke them down then have to sit there because off some invulnerability  mechanic that makes it more a grind then it needs to be.
---
Same here in GSF. Honestly new player corps do a ton to get everyone on their feet and back into the fighting.
---
My oh my, who what of thought the goons were the "pubbies" after all...
---
They'll kill you if you krab too, they warp to anoms and ded sites to purge the filthy krabs.
---
...it might be.
---
Luckily, salvaging drifters is profitable
---
So technically I am on your list then.
---
Dude watch CCP give u/Stain_Guy his lowsec gate (gift from trigs), only to have Drifters come blow it up.
---
He has to form up a fleet if he wants to keep it!
---
Yup and a damge caps never gonna help when you out numbered. Its just prolonging the enviable.
---
I'm usually quite shy, but...
---
A goon siting a killboard stat, Remedial will be pleased...
---
They'll come to your anoms and ded sites and kill you too fam. After camping your gates and killing your gating supers.
---
Whining about narratives on Reddit 
---
A clear indication you're probably retarded
---
Reading about it on reddit counts as "involved", right?
---
Yup mind you it also be nice that once the shield  is down you could target sub systems like launchers pd and othere external  modules, 
---
Alowing you to defange it.
---
Making isk to play the game is pretty easy. You can also just buy in to one of the Eve packs and sell what they give you. Great start. Welcome back.
---
What if they give Stain 8 lowsec static holes?
---
Yet here you are, thriving despite your disabilities we're all proud of you, you're doing great!
---
the year isn't 2010 anymore stop living in the past.
---
Having your stuff contested regardless of your super umbrella is hard.
---
"no u"
---
No u
---
ofc id rather pvp. but ''helldunks or blueballs'' while nip/blue up most of eve.. maybe, just maybe doesnt support the pvp part!?
---
and if you mean with pvp the ''war'' in the north, i wouldnt really call structure grinding pvp..
---
&gt;and if you mean with pvp the ''war'' in the north, i wouldnt really call structure grinding pvp..
---
I love this "It's not pvp if nobody defends the shit!"
---
Yep, if this shit is a permanent mechanic, saving your structures from drifter bash 49595434 for zero reward sounds about as fun as shooting myself in the head.
---
Have a few suicidal missions. They already have one in the combat tutorials
---
Well, if there are dozens of cruisers with 100km point, 700dps, 150km of weapon range and goes up 2k/s, there ain't many real solution other than feeding cheap but high dps stuff and see what comes out from the other side
---
good job, Diplos
---
If it's so and we don't like it, then why is everyone else quitting instead of us?
---
This hyporhetical wipe is pointless without fixing the core problems in today's balance. Well-organized groups will still have a massive head start, so it'll be fun for the first 6 months or so, but then we'll back to Rorquals' paradise.
---
Really Einstein? So your suggestion because you're pissed and want to throw a tantrum because your structures are getting shot is to cry about how CCP should remove all NPC stations from the game to make it fair? Is that the argument that you want to make?
---
Yea CCP used it for comment, hehe
---
is solo lowsec cruiser pvp still a thing? I haven't played in forever, but all this new stuff has me interested again.
---
This isn't about GMs banning renting, its about renters being able to hold space against capital-one-shotting fleets of NPCs.
---
I think the null just needs to run and hide and let the inevitable happen. CCP wants to purge the trash. This will be over soon. Probably won't even last a week.
---
They aren't dropping the usual blue loot
---
i mean... structure grinding is complete aids, nothing else... if you want to kill every structure in the north.. just go at it again after drifter stuff is ''over''. its not like anyone would be able to compete with goons all of a sudden. and imo keeps shouldnt exist anyways...
---
my point is, that there is much, much better pvp content than shooting aids structures...
---
Probably.
---
The only assest safty you should have is the assests you save yourself in nullsec
---
triangles are the strongest geometric shape
---
Completely oblivious to the fact other wars were occurring with Competent pilots who tried to defend as well, and they also got interrupted
---
Eve has always been both a PvE and PvP  environment. Many players in high sec try to avoid PvP but can't. PvP is pushed upon them. Those in null are getting PvE pushed upon them and they're crying over it. Whatever happened to adapt or die?
---
Bit fuckin early to be making predictions that it is no big deal. Its day 2 and this entire expansion has been about escalating phases.
---
The tutorials yes, also very much the overview. The first thing a new player need to do is fiddle with that thing while having no clue what anything is for. Unless the new player magicly knows about one of the overview packs.
---
7 bigger kills. jesus. how will we ever survive.
---
if that is all, i am not impressed.
---
You always have a chance. I started a fresh account 2 weeks ago and decided not to trade anything or give money to my new account. (My others are 125+ mill).
---
I've had a lot of fun pvping on this new account.
---
Not to mention he was in a state today in the TIS discord, which if I was in that state, he would name it a "meltdown" in his next INN show.
---
Yes all classes of ships get used. You do get guys that still like to drop supers on everything but once you know the names you know who to avoid. Most people aren't daft though and try not to kill of the content by spamming caps. 
---
You need a good corp though that's part of a lowsec alliance imo. That way you should get regular roams and some bigger fights normally over a structure.
---
We did not see any screenshots yet, so I guess it didn't happen? Kinda sad to be honest.
---
Yeah, so what. They are testing the boundaries. 40 T1 dessies died.  Lolol
---
Kspace drifters are not very profitable.
---
You should let someone explain to you how jumpclones and deathclones work. You'll explore a whole new world of gameplay.
---
&gt; Goons occupy a very small section of space with a very large force this will hurt all others far more than goons you'd be a fool to think otherwise
---
So why are you complaining then?
---
What is this, a crossover?
---
Think "Nuke".  So ya pretty much.
---
Sitting in sotiyo with it
---
What is missing from the Sister of Eve arc that your proposal would fix/replace?
---
Renters can't hold space against 10 man roaming gangs, what the hell do capital one shotting fleets of NPC's have to do with them living anywhere?
---
Its really funny to watch all you space holders bitch about having to patrol the space you hold.  You chose this life, fuck you all bitched at the game company until THIS life was the only one you could live in EVE.
---
You picked it, now suck it up and live with it.
---
Who are large space controlling entities again ? Skill u just disbanded Imperium and Legacy will have no issue defending with their numbers, NC PL already can't hold their space.
---
At worst Gotg will have to control less space.
---
Too bad nobody gives a fuck about some larper's opinion in 2019.
---
Only time will tell if this was the right decision
---
Because ending a pvp war to engage in pve content is shit.
---
Nice detail
---
10/10 Would SOV fight again.
---
My name is mikal vektor and I approved this shitpost.
---
&gt; Realistically taking sov off of an active megacoalition as an independent is basically impossible
---
This is true.  This is just as true as saying that an alliance that can't hold its space doesn't deserve it.  Stop wishing to the CCPLS to build the sandcastle how you want it.  Get some friends together and go take whatever space it is that you want.
---
And another thing, which entities are going to be best able to handle drifters?  Megacoalitions with bluetral neighbors, capable of simultaneously fielding fleets across all timezones, both to attack neutral neighbors while leaving other fleets back home to protect structures from Drifters..... or those independents, who have to secure all of their borders while still fighting Drifters, all with the same 40 man fleet?
---
While the news says that Goons have redeployed home, that doesn't mean that Drifters are breaking Goons.  They're just going firm until they can figure out what is happening with this event.  Seriously, Imperium, Legacy, PanFam, WinterCo will all be fine.  It's those small independents that will suffer.  
---
Drifters will not break up coalitions.  They will do the opposite.
---
Rogue Venom tried to scramble a defense but was unable to log in.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75129403/
---
Meiqur why you such a meanie?
---
They also use those modules to scan your ship while you are tethered. Spooky
---
Thanks I'll have to look into that!
---
How TF am I supposed to stop them from bashing my 57th keepstar 8 regions away smh CCP not cool
---
Seems like a fun idea I dont think I'm that experienced but I do like the idea of starting fresh
---
Or a capsuleer in a Noctis
---
Can you kill them with a supercarrier ?
---
Can strongly recommend their service .
---
BURN IT TO THE CORE BABY
---
Maybe you can pay them off with your beloved dronebux (if you still have some left) ;)
---
You apparently gave enough of a fuck to comment so...
---
Yes, very easily. 
---
Just fit for full DPS and application. Easy mode.
---
Adapt or die
---
Superweapon can already launch web probe
---
Net number of supers produced by ProviBloc's 'Project Titan' super building project: -1
---
And let them have multiple tier 1 frigs as rewards . Maybe introduce a pvp type mission or two. “Find some one to duel” .
---
You could even have a fork into a faction warfare newbie arc. With pvp tasks like “lose a ship”
---
Sven of Nine was more nine out of ten
---
I thought you guys were all about the objective, not good fights.
---
According to your leader, Drifters are gonna wipe out Dronelands because your enemies "can’t defend and have had their willpower drained by our attacks"
---
If you really all believed that, you'd be celebrating. (Of course those of you who can actually think and not just swill propaganda do not actually believe that, which is why we're seeing such a hilarious meltdown dissonance of a response from you guys.)
---
[Smiling Drifter pic I made using CCP art and some generic face alteration website I found if anybody wants it](https://i.imgur.com/LbIYdIj.jpg).
---
I have no structures, you're 0/2, I'm just pointing out what needs to be said.
---
So many self righteous people like you in game that just want to hurt others as long as it doesn't affect you.
---
So you're saying you weren't forced, it was a choice.
---
*shrugs* my space pixels are safe and ill profit from this either way, wanna buy cormorants?
---
Gnosis
---
Nobody pointed a gun at our heads, but our structures.
---
So you let them burn and replace them, nothing FORCED anybody to go anywhere, it was a choice.  You choose to live where you live and you choose to not functionally properly use Jump Clones to deal with the threat, or hell, even the idiots that never left delve ratting.
---
Choice, not coercion
---
Would be cool to print it from titanium.
---
/u/ccp_fozzie this guy have its point.
---
Thank you for posting this, for there was certainly not a post containing this exact same br posted 1 hour ago. Have a great day
---
not bad, enyo killing a hecate.
---
Its like when the little brother gets the big brother in a headlock.
---
So this is a battle of the secses.
---
sounds like whiny bitches to me
---
We weren't prepared for this.
---
Yep
---
But what about tank? I know that the battleships have a subcapital doomsday. I am afraid that they will kill the super with it.
---
If its not that hard, goons dont need to go home and let the spodbrains handle the drifters
---
My man.
---
But i was told Drifters make PVP impossible D:
---
The noob arc exists and is called the "Sisters of Eve" epic arc. You can fly  it in a T1 destroyer.
---
Well especially that moving goon titan fleet takes almost 2 weeks.
---
There is a difference between hard and critical mass with numbers.. Its not hard to fill a fleet with 200 t1 destroyers,  if you have 200 people at home ready to fly them
---
I know how they work, and with an 18 hour cool down you are still at some point going to end up stuck in the ass end of nowhere with very little to do.
---
We have a guy who actually laughs like this, if a bit wheezier.
---
I just enjoy the irony of risk-averse nuller complaining about them getting ganked.
---
And the first phase is already shit, more of this isn't going to be an improvement.
---
But what about tank. I know that the battleships have a doomsday (The Zohan weapon :). When the blue shield is down will they fire on the fighters or on the supercarrier?
---
For HTP, a hel &amp; rorque gank is worth a reddit post and chest beating.
---
\*Whispers\* being a driftwood dentured cock splatter with shitty posts and opinions and having a positive karma count are not mutually exclusive.
---
Sort Dragon will be along soon to fawn at your feet
---
&gt; A Drifter cyno next to your solo Rorqual?
---
why would they cyno, they can generate wormholes at will
---
Thx I just had a qurious about it.
---
Now you're just being ridiculous. You all trumpeted your "revolution" as part of your successful strategy to open your alliance to every mouthbreather who comes along (those you used to call "pubbies").
---
Yet now the entire null is forced to defend structures and engage in the very combat your complaining about
---
Is this the crusty crab?
---
Where was TEST?
---
10/10 would tap that
---
Mittens suck.
---
You'd know, I guess.
---
The drifters have special eyes.
---
robot tiddies 100%
---
**GOOD FUCKING LUCK TANKING BATTLESHIP DD's YOU DUMB FUCKING TRIANGLES**   
---
*^(this post is brought to you by the capsuleers for drifters association)*
---
Thanks for the repost, be sure to post all of these you see as im sure you will see alot more and we need this quality content on reddit ::sarcasm::
---
with those stats, it would have to be a very expensive, very niche fit, probably with a pirate tank implant set, but it could be done - perhaps in a paladin - if it weren't for the drifter dd
---
Drifters already won reddit.
---
They can't track the fighters. That's where the DPS comes from, and what gets the aggro.
---
ITS 😠 NOT 😠 A 😠 SANDBOX 😠 IF 😠 IT 😠 NERFS 😠 MY 😠 PLAYSTYLE
---
btw @ me when I can fly a Drake in ecp8r again without getting fucked by jaguar carriers and your mum's small penis
---
It’s not as if I would be asking for all that much.
---
They are so cheeky little buggers :-).
---
Yesterday, When I  logged in EVE, I felt honored to see this stunning event,  this is great for the game(long term view)  . Watching the Goons force in the game have a panic attack and run was awesome.
---
This is literally like saying don't pay your speeding fine, you can do whatever it is you were doing after you get out of jail.
---
Like yeah, that's an option but it's fucking retarded.
---
The great reset of 2019.
---
That tear of joy though.
---
Yes
---
And on the seventh day, they still didnt undock and fight, so Tyrannos Strategos just blew the station up
---
Goon warps ratting titan to haven   
---
Goon lands   
---
Goon hears hull alert

fuck i only know like 50% then!

Just wait until there’s a Drifter Invasion in that system, and everyone will be too busy docking up to tackle you. Then, you can fly your Drake and get fucked by 14 Drifters that ream your hitpoints with their filthy big 1k DPS omnidamage and massive 500km point range.
---
Aww I made it to the top!
---
Why would anyone build Hels?
---
Ironic as CCP patched them to dominance.
---
The mechanics of dealing with them was never the issue.
---
Better than mining a couple forgotten moon rocks.
---
Tl dr, OP got banned, is a little bitch about it
---
HTFU and just go play wow
---
They are good nano supers for smash n' dash drops?
---
I have snakes it's fine

---
But circles are the most efficient!

... Unsure where I’m going with that but you get the gist

I can already achieved all my objectives, I would be alright with this.

SANSHA KUVEKAI'S BODY WAS NEVER FOUND
---
I just casually got back into it.
---
The game is full of pinatas. I find people in lowsec in faction ships that don’t align in green whatevers - and will sit there as you burn 70km to them on ab tackle and kill them.
---
I had to work for kills in 2011.
---
I also fly frigs.
---
We use Armor ships :)
---
Don't associate ustz provi with eutz provi though please, we don't have any control over what they do it seems.
---
Maybe she want Teabagging, i guess.
---
&gt; If you want to limit renting, you have to add more neutral space to run logistics through.
---
in particular this is extremely true with regards to the drone regions
---
there's a couple of strong reasons they've been renter space for the majority of their existence:
---
1. their geographic isolation makes them very quiet and ideal for farming  
---
2. their geographic isolation makes it so that anyone holding a deeper drone region (i.e. oasa, cobalt, etc) without some kind of a logistical arrangement with the entities between them and empire (i.e. living in geminate, etherium, etc) will be strangled out
---
i think for two major reasons:
---
1. goons still expect you to hit pap quotas  
---
2. some people don't like goon culture
---
the first one is the major one honestly, in my experience (have been doing a lot of slumlording and renter white knighting over the past couple months) a good chunk of renters are just high sec players that want bigger numbers than you get in high sec. they have no aspiration to be pvp players and would rather pay somebody else to do that for them while they enjoy their play style
---
there are also (significantly less) people who rent on alts to support their nomadic pvp mains
---
Fair comment - Tbh APOC is generally bad at caps... i wouldn't expect this of the rest of provi tbh
---
no1 knows that this is all about... even if it contains playing with shit mechanics for now, it could lead to a better eve or a worse. or it could be complete meaningless and shit. but complainig about it BEFORE we know whats going on is just stupid.
---
If you can’t take the heat move to high sec.
---
Need a T2 rig to bonus T2 ships...
---
Suggest you pull the T1 rig. Stop being a poor and pi in the proper T2 rig
---
There was some idiotic twat around 2010 that had more white knight orbiters than an average belt.
---
CCP even hired her as some community person.
---
Shit bern going on for a while.
---
Isnt the only way to get to thera through wormhole connections? If it was k space I could get to it through jumpgates right?
---
I mean, don't jinx it, just treat ustz and eutz as they're completely separate groups :)
---
300 mill each PogU
---
Yeah but how many of those are goons? I need to know before I come.

While scholars disagree about some of the more nuanced interpretations of this ancient Terran text, it would seem to foretell a Triglavian victory over an enemy that may be the Drifters, and ultimately over the human civilizations of New Eden:

&gt; I'd like to see you try to call TIKLE "psuedo renters" to their face. That oughta end well.
---
been there, done that. fawlty is a quality lad but tikle doesn't stand on their own feet tbh
---
i think he was talking about j4gs who join tapi for the safe ratting space and only go on enough fleets to not get purged
---
The complaining is about current mechanics what is happening right now.. Not the future in anyway maybe it will lead to something interesting right now its ended all null pvp and forced every alliance home to defend their structures or pull a NC. And let it burn for no reason what sort of option is that..
---
you know that drifters fuck up supers right?
---
But it's always super duper risky in nullsec 100% of all of the time!!!!111
---
Pull out before the hull timer.
---
Only fly what you can afford to loose rule one of eve.
---
Yep suicide alpha trashers or talwars also work well, you don't even meta fit them. 
---
They are to warp do 1-2 shoot and warpoff or die.
---
I hope this obliterates 0.0 as a whole and that it needs to literally be rebuilt from scratch and with entirely different strategy.
---
Even Delve can't supply enough tinfoil for r/Eve at the moment
---
I mean the leader of provi has a shield titan, so never say never
---
&gt; I honestly tried Eve, it's just so goddamn boring. Nothing ever happens. Like at all. It's just watching spreadsheets pretend they're building a station or whatever.
---
And just like that, everyone forgot about the systemic issues plaguing the game
---
Well played CCP, well played
---
jita
---
What PvP wars do they speak of? For that to happen wouldn't need people to undock?
---
Little guy groups don't have to replace Keepstars, Sotiyos or region-wide infrastructure.
---
Megacoalitions have had unimpeded ability to lay out sprawling masses of the stuff with entire supply chains relying on it and now they have the potential to fall under their own weight. 
---
A little guy group has much less to lose and recovers vastly more quickly if they're dedicated.
---
As for the both hilariously and infuriatingly ignorant idea that we little guy alliances can just "get some friends together and go take whatever space it is that you want," Eve should not require having 200+ friends just to survive. This is a video game and the threshold between HTFU and "lol you're just screwed with no recourse" was crossed a very long time ago.
---
Low power citadels everywhere should have no timers. Would certainly hell with the structure spam
---
This 👏 is 👏 how 👏 they 👏 remove 👏 citadels 👏 
---
🙏🙏🙏
---
I dunno, olmeca is still camping there im sure if he pitched in his personal supply
---
This makes me happy to hear might be a good time to learn everything again with all the noobs jumping in quick question tho I made my account in like 2013 and picked a very uh.. 6 years ago name is it possible to like siphon all my sp to a alt?
---
Ya and for anything pvp that stuff is armor for us :)
---
Its almost like NC. Is not the only alliance in this game?? What the actual fuck am i right
---
Allow me to tinfoil with you further. Perhaps we are seeing a soft reset of null with other spaces coming soon. Perhaps the Hadeon tech being tested inst as far away as thought. PERHAPS they are boiling the frog so to speak by reserving how null is treated in conjunction with a combat update and server update. Perhaps even tickrate update with the Hadeon tech....okay I tinfoiled to much
---
We don't want you so much as we want your landlords to stop choking out everyone else.
---
Lol, the drifters weren't evicting you from delve drama queen.
---
If winning Eve requires not playing, then the Drifters are DEFINITELY winning Reddit because they don't post or even read the place.
---
Would you care to put a number out about how many they RF'd, because you're using a plural here like it might be all of them, and it most certainly wasn't.  
---
You were more than capable of using jump clones to defend the timers and continue prosecuting the north.
---
MY BRAND
---
Its a PanFam conspiracy  they bribed CCP.
---
If they dont have any structures left to undock in.
---
No one can !!!
---
Lets upgrade the drifter as well and put in weird AI.
---
Webbing is possible till 500 km
---
Doomsday weapon damage upgrades
---
Speed upgrade
---
Instant target upgrade
---
Stealth mode not probable
---
Stealth mode not on dscan
---
Can hit stuff and point 500 km+
---
No damage limits when hotting structures
---
Camping gates Ai upgrade
---
Hunting AI upgrrade. It will hunt evryrhing that moves down
---
Omni tank upgrade
---
Omni damage upgrade
---
Microjump upgrade
---
Wormhole tech upgrade. 
---
 It can open a wormhole anywhere and any time randomly.
---
Sensors upgrade it will instant lock anything
---
Instant warp ddrive upgrade
---
Wy not and fuck up these stats. Those wormholehas hunted us too much
---
Its payback time
---
Sounds to me it actually was it also sounds like you got content nerds. Fuck never seen a bunch of bitches.
---
Needs all that for an AB?
---
&gt;how many they RF'd
---
Where did I imply they did other than threaten them?
---
[Reminds me of Jimmy Wales from Wikipedia](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/004/510/Jimmeh.jpg)
---
= dead supercarrier.
---
There are other ways to handle this though, for example treating the players that play with that agrarian style as assets.
---
Most of those players are pretty happy with the couple systems they do business in and have no intentions to bother their neighbours.
---
Let them grow, set up a fortizar with a market and buy your stuff there.
---
It may even be cheaper, because you skip the process of them hauling their stuff to Jita for sale to pay the rent and you using the rent money to fly to Jita and buy it again.
---
Glad to see people using my copy pasted message :p [Here is the pastebin](https://pastebin.com/rKtzyGzE) if you want to formatting to work. I generally just save the message on reddit and then edit the saved emssage to get to formatting right
---
To be honest, with the context it's based on, it's very fitting here. Tribute was definitely glassed.
---
Why fly a super and risk it when you can fly 1800 t1 trash fits and suicide for the same cost and likely achieve more?
---
There's video footage somewhere of a Paladin fighting drifter battleships and tanking the DD to like 3% armor before repping it back up. It's insanely hard and requires a lot of bling, but it's possible.
---
The Mittani is just feigning anger so we'll get caught off guard when a spy turns over Drifter assets.
---
This is what eve needs also for balance of market    the difference between produced and destroyed is still masive
---
I guess the Triangle means the Triglavians are in league with The Initiative.
---
This is what eve needs let is hopefully reset atleast half of null     let them kill all afk botters   and its structures
---
Inb4 a sleeper fleet comes out of a wormhole in Drekavacs they looted off some random astra
---
Fake or not, Mittens salt is best salt.
---
mainly they don't cause tidi
---
or leak intel
---
People are salty because the sandbox has ants in it.  Don't cry to CCPapa, get to stomping!
---
Nah, one is enough. And it only leads to Aridia
---
Dealing with who, the drifters be or the turbokrabs
---
Ooh these boys will do more than double my isk... my market orders are selling soooo well.
---
Have you been in a hisec system which you normally operate in when the Triglavians role in.    It has already affected a large number of people in hisec and I like it.
---
Either, both.
---
So you're pretending they don't destroy structures now?
---
What the hell does this world event have to do with not being able to deploy? 
---
Seems like people are just using this as an excuse to go home early.
---
I'm APOC's most prolific shit-poster, and even I can't really fault it. Not even going to try to spin it.
---
I don't know exactly what happened there but whatever the Hel pilot was up to, he done fucked up.
---
this...this is why you win the internet today lol
---
&gt;I don't think anyone is going to fight a war under these conditions, or at least not until people can understand the mechanics well enough to control and ignore them.
---
what we have here is one of them there self-solving problems
---
It's OK the drifters are not active in autz
---
No, this is Bluescreen
---
Heres how it went down.
---
Fedup tried a guardian and drekavic comp, logi held the drekavics fine while the first drifter died. then the drifters switched to the guardians and the reps couldn't keep up (I won't speculate too much but the drifters are very coordinated in switching targets and armor reps don't switch as quickly as shield reps do).
---
After the guardian deaths, fedup switched to suicide corms. generally it was about 5 dead corms when the battleship died so not a terrible trade. but the corms maybe stayed too long after killing the battleship leading to unnecessary corm deaths (real numbers were maybe 9 dead corms per dead drifter battleship). It would've been cheaper to warp in, kill 1 drifter, warp out, and then reship the few lost corms.
---
From what I saw a critical mass of corms would be very effective and isk efficient when dealing with the drifters, however fedup only had maybe 30 people on field. With 100 you should just be losing 1 corm per battleship when the overshield doomsday triggers and maybe not even have to leave the grid as you work through the drifters.
---
Dude, he meant that the drifters cause ruckus for two days and everybody is already supersalty.
---
Then explain faction standings and security status
---
I'm not talking about the guy making the post? I'm talking about the messages in the picture? Hello?
---
i've played other games where i did not need any kind of interaction with devs at all
---
You're 3 hours late
---
how dare ccp does something new that apparently shakes up a big part of eve and forces ppl to figure out whats actually happening... fuck them
---
You're saying drifters noticed the capsuleers messed around with triglavians and they will end their invasion, but they have to remove us first, as we're the unpredictable factor?
---
So when the triglavian threat is neutralized, they might leave us alone again... interesting.
---
Give raw skill points for completing each mission in a noob arc
---
uh, yeah they are. you get about 8 mill worth of blue loot and antikythrian mechanism per drifter battleship
---
How many Rorquals do we need to mine all of Goonswarm's salt in a timely manner?
---
Lowsec exploration, while not as rewarding, does feel nice and scrappy with all the randoms around. Very fun :)
---
fake news
---
&gt;I really don't care what mechanics are used, but Eve really needs this "What the fuck is going on" feeling more often.
---
sign
---
that feeling when you bait so well people put your threads in memes
---
We shall see
---
Mitanis salt was grade A quality
---
calling bashing undefendes structures a war is a bit rich
---
low power citadels in highsec shouldn't have timers AND shouldn't require a war dec to destroy.
---
The only skill I would advise to have is scanning skills to map the WH, and data/relic skills to make isk from exploration sites. Maybe gas mining too. For the rest, I'm sure you can hunt with your corp with very little, just ask them.
---
Lowsec is actually a great place for it, as people from all around new eden could engage with the content
---
There is nothing to figure out.. Like I understand the outside looking in it might see chaotic but it is literally wait at home, when they attack station, form up 200 t1 suicide ships, blow up 5-10 drifters lost 50 ish ships, they warp off, rinse n repeat
---
Made me chuckle uncontrollably for a couple minutes, have a plat as thanks.
---
There is a group of people using titans.
---
The number of structures you have has nothing to do with the Drifters.
---
So from what I heard and seen he was protecting a Rorqual who got jumped on.  It went from a Tic of 5 to 15 to 62. I seen someone post in channel for help but guessing nobody came. O well
---
This has actually happened before! It was wayyyyy back in the early days, sometime around 2004-05 level ancient times during m0o era etc.
---
Basically risk-averse players were abusing the bad AI at the time to gate camp high sec using remote reppers. CPP spawned a bunch of Jove ships, some piloted by CCP themselves, and either blew them all up or just straight translocated their ships to the middle of nowhere, outside of high sec.
---
Kinda feels a bit familiar eh? Abusing the system to make the most dangerous areas risk free seems warranted for another shake-up. Oh, and they damn well whinged back then too.
---
I'd say it is not in a realm of impossible for CCP to wipe out all the null and leave it inhabited with drifters for a year or two just to be able to build sov anew from scratch without whining and tears of null inhabitants
---
Are you by any means the NalanaVos from Evero? :)
---
I think you're talking about World of Warcraft. Any noob can buy the new edition of Wow, and have a max level character. 
---
Under your system a new player could could sit in a Nyx, and it would be just as hard to kill as a 10 year vets Nyx.
---
Anyone have a decent fit to tank Drifters?
---
... Why would you have to delete them?
---
It would be easier to just use an old laptop to run the alpha account
---
If you want to know that, ask tuzy. He will know the precise number.
---
nothing to figure out? ok why do we have drifters then all of a sudden? explain pls
---
You may have missed it but alphas are capped at 20m skillpoints with only 5m being trainable while alpha.
---
Not sure if sarcastic but yes, if it's players vs inanimate inject isn't pvp
---
was actually able to run it in a wormhole too for those of us who don't know what local is.
---
wait provi has a super fleet?
---
So PvE-ers get salty when PvP is forced upon them, and now PvP-ers are salty that PvE is forced upon them.
---
I was reading the Mittani's comments on the TIS Discord and I just think he does not get it at all, as do the rest of these players complaining about it.   We are playing in a game with a living and breathing environment which has a threat level which will obviously ebb and flow at times.   A player has to deal with the environment and other players and getting salty about either is just wrong on so many levels.
---
I am neither hoping for or demanding that NPC's wipe out all of Nullsecs infrastructure, however I would not be bothered if that is what the Drifters tried to do within a spurt invasion scenario.   What I am happy to see happen is that space is more dangerous and it does not matter whether it is player driven or NPC, it is a good thing for Eve if this is the case.
---
As I am currently in hisec and I can say that having the Triglavians drop on your system is rather fun and different and adds to the game, I also like FOB's a lot.
---
Stop moaning and adapt or just die, nothing else to add really.
---
Why not just use faceapp?
---
[https://i.imgur.com/TzhVPkt.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/TzhVPkt.jpg)
---
They have multiple timers. They don't have to prevent a reinforcement
---
It's irrelevant,  they are attacking structures,  attacking them back makes them warp away - everything we need to know worked out lol
---
We're trying hard to use these content generation citadels, but not that many fights start
---
Oh no, a few days off npc threats. What will we do?
---
That would be good and that will bring people back and give small alliances a chance to own sov instead of being some dumb renter
---
So you called off the attack for nothing then, got it.
---
We didn't need a reason to go home. Tribute is completely wiped except, I think, a single fortizar. We destroyed the majority of the ihubs in vale on Tuesday, and most of the major citadel targets are already dead, with a couple of exceptions. We'd exhausted all of the targets within range of KQK. There was going to be some discussion about forward deploying again, but most likely we were going to start move ops back to delve on saturday
---
A dude who doesnt even log in complains about pvp warfare ay lmao
---
https://secure.eveonline.com/DLC/default.aspx since it's not linked
---
I have this same theory as well, with the added bonus that all the Abyssal filament stuff, and the conduits during Invasions right now, are just a test ground for the Triglavian to evaluate us as potential allies in their efforts against the Drifter, which are soon to be more overt and in the open, a full scale war so to speak.
---
That's why Triglavians aren't interested in HS (and LS, when they spill over) capsuleers' structures: they aren't invading us, they are finally peaking out of their hiding spot, Abyssal Space, because they are finally strong enough to feel like they can face the real enemies: the Drifters.
---
I'm sure my theory will get debunked by people better at the Lore than me, but would be a cool idea to create PVE content interlinked across regions, and sec status. Maybe once (and if) the Triglavians decide we are "worthy" of fighting with them against the Drifters, their mission lines and agents will become available as a faction in HS/LS, and that will have a direct effect on how effective they will be in fighting the Drifters in Null. Capsuleers in Null will be fighting directly, aided by NPC Triglavians, while capsuleers in LS/HS will indirectly help through the running of missions, clearing of sites, and whatever... while making money and LP at the same time. Would be cool, no?
---
I'd definitely be up for all structures everywhere not having a timer if it is in low power, that will clean up a lot of them. But I do still think war decs should be required in high sec. Remember you wouldn't get anything from it anyway cos of asset safety but they will be cleared up in no time anyway.
---
Null sec should maybe have asset safety nerfed (it's not high sec after all) but yeah low power structures shouldn't have a timer
---
bro, you're literally chicken little, they didn't rf all your structures in Delve, stop being a big baby, you CHOSE to go home because a couple of buildings go shot, nothing was stopping you from shooting the north AND saving the few buildings that were rf'd.
---
Stop acting like the single cycled all of delve.
---
Sometimes I wonder how your brain works
---
''its irrelevant to do anything in life since we will die at some point anyways''
---
and i thought im a bittervet..
---
We had no idea how good we had it with Voyager.
---
Then we got Enteprise, and we realised it all ;)
---
I'm gonna shoot you a spoiler: It wasn't that many.
---
Because it's a bit more satisfying to do it yourself than let npcs do it.
---
Hi
---
had
---
That was a Bait Hel that was pulled correctly out of a contract and moved to Provi.
---
same
---
Yes, because this isn't going to escalate at all, is it?
---
They sent crosses anymore
---
Am i hiding?
---
You shouldnt play a game just because if sunk cost.
---
That's game addiction
---
Yeah it's just a bit shit that by "things shaking up" he meants players fighting NPCs and not players having more incentive to attack other players.
---
Sounds like you should have left a while ago.
---
Sunk cost fallacy
---
Well that answer is simple. Stop all pvp combat and go back to ratting?
---
lie's provi never had a super fleet,  ignore all the times you seen a super there fake.
---
you get about half the build materials back in salvage. If i could go around and pop a few astras or raitarus each day for a bill of salvage you know i'd do it.
---
then of course theres the potential for any fit modules/services to drop
---
and theres the possibility that a raitaru has an undelivered or paused job that can drop its output/input.
---
Its totally worth killing structures as a past time, but it sucks when there reinforcement timers and it sucks when i open up a wormhole to see one in kspace but am not gonna be there 24 hrs later to wardec it.
---
If true (probably is), why blame rifters?
---
why? most of them are safely crabbing and there are no enemies for 2 reagions
---
It's not sunk cost
---
Eve is fun once you have an established character. Until then, it's trash.
---
love the salt
---
It's only been 2 days.
---
They're still crosses to me. I'm old, get off my lawn, damn kids.
---
This is easy, Goons say they had to stop the attack on the north because the drifters were burning delve, thats actually not what happened by your own words, so you could have kept attacking but you chose not to.  There were even easy logistical ways to handle it with Jump clones. 
---
So to answer your question, my brain works like a normal person who would have puzzled through the non mystery of how to handle both problems at once.
---
You shouldn't spend your whole life living in fear, its bad for you.
---
Agreed but on your last point that would sort of be changing the game to fit your individual playstyle. High sec should have different rules and there are loads of wardec corps already (I live in a wh too btw so I'm not biased against wormholers).
---
Could always just create a high sec alt corp and wardec to kill structures in high sec that way
---
Yeah, it's WILD how much complaining is going on about something that nobody really understands yet and hasn't had time to truly see the results of.
---
Considering your brain says there's only 2 options for the situation, burning or untouched, I doubt it.
---
When I last played it was 10 hours.
---
Right, the drifter will just do a few shield timers.
---
I know it might not actually apply in this instance, but it's all about perspective.
---
I'd read a post about a guys frigate kill if that meant a lot to him, a story of a faction-warfare rivalry or a revenge for a T1 Hauler loss, etc. Just because it's a different scale to what you might play at, doesn't mean it's not Good EvE :)
---
Big alliances is the reason eve dies   to mutch renting shit  and not giving small alliances a chance to hold a few sov systems
---
I keep skipping around and I can't find her actually playing the game at all...just meta talking about streaming.
---
Yeah, generally when I'm away from home and some one tells me there's a group of guys up to no good making trouble in my neighbourhood, panic is an appropriate response.
---
At the risk of taking the bait. Goons were slowly wrapping up their deployment up north. Move ops were slowly trickling home. When the drifters attacked, they were forced to move back home ASAP at a rather unpleasant speed due to move ops getting shoved forward to get active supers home. They decided to spin that 'The drifters killed our war because we have to go home to save our structures!' even though the amount of supers remaining in Delve are ten-fold the amount to hold off the Drifter forces with one hand while the other hand alternates between netflix and semi-afk ratting. However, they may have not felt secure using supers against the drifters with the numerous dreadbombs staged within Delve without a massive supercap blob advantage, hence why they felt the need to fully recall their deployment supers. Its all spin at this point.
---
**TL;DR:** Goons were withdrawing, had to hastily return to Delve to 'save structures from dumb NPCs,' which may or may not be true.
---
You didn't say you were having fun.
---
You said you are only playing because you've put to and money into it.
---
says the group that acted like it had 2 options, fight the war or go home cause a few structures were on their first timer.
---
C'mon Dran, you're better than this.
---
Ha! turbo krabs in a pvp game pushed back by pve content. O boy its so fun in eve right now.
---
So glad offensive empires cant push their toxic glassing campaigns anymore.
---
Yea, only you dont have access to jump clones, your EVE alt does, and shit tons of them at that, with 19 hour cool downs on jumping so you need not even be out of theater for a full 24 hours....
---
I assume you basically don't care for any nullsec alliance then?  Cause NC/PL have had keepstars reffed and actually lost structures.
---
I forgot there is noone else in the game besides goons and the poor NC. victims..
---
the goons were removing structures faster than any drifters lol we are saved. there is a ccp
---
Please don't, but donate any future tears to the Amarr Lowsec fund. We distill tears into pure H2O that we use to rust Minmatar hulls, preventing the ships from operating at peak efficiency.
---
You thought Muninns were bad enough as is? You can thank us for them not being on par with Drifter tech.
---
so drifters are the concord of null?
---
I think they should also add the ability to kill cloaky ships.
---
If I wasn't having fun I wouldn't be playing.
---
Who's that Mittani loser and why is he constantly whining?
---
I posted an idea a while ago were t1 frigs and cruisers didn't require magic 14 to level 5, level 3 and 4 of magic 14 maxed the stats out for frigs and cruisers, the level 5s just didn't count toward these hulls. Doing that would knock off nearly a  year of training. I personally think tiering the skills system is the answer. Needing maxed out skills for BC and above is fair but expecting a new player to stay when they see a years skill queue to get the best out of a kestrel is daft. I know the reality is that you don't need max skills but it's the perception. That hill.
---
Also another idea I have is for "concord academy" solar systems adjacent to new player systems, that are locked to t1 frigs and cruisers (and have a limit to fit) and are pvp enabled with 100%  ship reimbursement, like for like replacement., with a fee to enter the more combat sp you have, allowing industry dudes to feed the market and enter for free.
---
 Get the new players into PvP as quickly as possible, no initial risk, get them on it with game mechanics.
---
I like your idea too.
---
Unless you need to move between them more frequently.
---
I like how all usernames were cut out, except one.
---
Yes yesss. NC is saved. hahah krabs are beating you. Ahhhaaa so happy we are a structure free alliance!
---
Sooo to get this straight. You had to cut your northern deployment short for content that 'is a massive flop' and is easily and perfectly defended against?
---
For exploration game is as good as ever. There are a few bots but its rare in good space. For solo pvp it s a bit worst imo but you can still find fights in places like geminate or esoteria catch. You dont want to start with a ceptor as they are unforgiving and extremely sp heavy for solo pvp.
---
The invasion part was refering to triglavians in highsec. With dev publicity only say about triglavians.
---
No nody expected the drifter ones in null.
---
Now some of us start thinking on what is coming for lowsec and wormhole space.
---
Except you still have your renters and PL overlords to bend over for, you're free from nothing
---
hilmar nc member confirmed!
---
Nice job. I am considering buying a 3D printer for custom miniature creation. What printer did you use? A resin/DLP printer? Again, cool job.
---
Not sure what all the fuss is about Goon diplos are on it and the drifters will be joining the Imperium for dank ticks.....Done deal
---
I think the mittani is confusing PvP for PvS, Player versus Structures there on his twitter feed.
---
Of course! we hang in stations all the time.
---
Most of null is NPCs anyways so whats the difference?
---
You can't move between them more frequently than 19 hours (thats maxed skills) unless you're using a citadel in which case no timer is created so theres even less reason not to use them.
---
Just face it bud, this was a bad knee jerk reaction for a problem that was solved in less than 24 hours, and now your leadership is trying to blame an NPC for its bad choices.
---
Run
---
:cough: cough: flair tanking

 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77507184/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77507184/)   
---
Yeah, sure , just a few shield timers
---
Not a single move op happend before the drifter thingy.
---
Well if NC and PL had actually fought we'd've had a decent war.  Also it's not just GSF fighting wars in nullsec at the moment.  This affects all of nullsec.  If it's a short term thing, then it's fine.  Or if it's going to simmer down to a background noise, that's also fine.  But ultimately it's going to hurt small groups more than bigger groups.  Also in my previous eve life I was a director of a small nullsec alliance and a hisec carebear for years.  This will definitely be painful for an alliance that getting a few forts down was a big deal.
---
As a proud NC docker i am very happy about the latest turd of events.
---
Or just run two omega accounts as the rule says
---
Well you are not hiding very well. You were suppose to be in Goonswarm and near youre name I see NC.
---
Because instead of a 10% chance of forward deploying and continuing the war, it's now a 0% chance
---
Exactly, you can't... So the only option was to return to delve.
---
Imagine wanting to pew and then joining the largest faction.
---
Fire up the rumour mill boys and girls!!
---
&gt; As a proud NC docker i am very happy about the latest turd of events.
---
If that's a typo, it's perfect
---
not my sotiyo ;)
---
I have learned from NC to do elite reddit pvp by masking my thermal signature in order to better sperg.
---
Gives a narative to the pap chasers. Glass the north and now defend the south. It sounds better than "numbers shrinked and fcs are burning out, we are packing up to do the PVE"
---
1000 titans, you call that decent war ???
---
I've said before my worry is that we are all getting excited and it might not be as destructive as we first thought.   Judging by the killboard it's not been anything major especially with structures so it could be they have reinforced a few and will come back or not (is the AI that intelliegent)
---
Unless they are making more waves and if they started hitting ihubs and tcus then it would certainly  shake things up. But at the moment it seems nothing more than a minor nosebleed sadly..
---
If you think feeding t1 destroyers to red crosses will give a magic bullet for some economic problem, I got this bridge for sale....
---
It's really the only thing that could get me to resub. I played off-and-on for years, I'm not even sure if I could reactivate my toons, and the lost skill training time / character age  / learning all the new balancing and tweaking all my new fits is too intimidating and I work too much / have more of a life now.
---
But everyone back to zero and I have the chance to play on a more even field? Very interesting.
---
Or just spawn there for no reason, if it's needed. They are NPCs after all.
---
feeding t1 destroyers apparently was so hard goons had to ''retreat'' back to delve..
---
You sound like the guy raging after he walked into a teemo shroom.
---
What are incentives that wouldn't merely further entrench the winners?
---
&gt; null needs reset give smaller allianes a chance to hold sov
---
Baffling. I mean the big alliances can easily fight off dozens of drifters.  Small alliances, it's a bit harder.
---
This has to be said over and over again.  Anything you do to nerf nullsec hurts the little guy more than the big, organised bloc.  Unless you nerf being organised itself, which you can't because it's mostly out of game infrastructure, you cannot nerf big blocs with respect to smaller entities.
---
That is all.
---
You dont need skill injectors to learn skills. Skill injectors provide skillpoints that can be used to instantly complete the training of a certain level of a skill. You can also train the skills by waiting (as you have no doubt noticed). Injecting a skillbook so a skill can be trained is not the same as injecting skillpoints.
---
Skill injectors may be useful to truly new players, but they also have problems like older players injecting endgame ships and constantly expanding their ability to farm endgame content which drives up prices of certain items like plex (used to keep an account in omega state). This causes players who do not want to farm every day to quit. To some extent, skill injectors encourage replacing pvp focused players with multiboxing farmers that sit protected under the "supercap umbrella" in nullsec making isk all day.
---
I haven't read any of his comments, but since he's a top-level admin, I'd assume he says things to influence the mood/thought process of those who are subservient to him - more so than just venting his own feelings. Be a commoner and all that
---
Because normal people are:
---
A) cowards
---
B) lazy
---
C) sheep
---
I never had the numbers but I always assumed that most of the ncpl renters were ncpl members krabing alts.
---
You seem more informed than me, do you know approximate percentage breakdown ?
---
Shittani shitting up twitter again? More shocking news at 11:00!!!
---
I don't understand r/eve logic. "Muh NS is just about mining and ratting" CCP introduce more PvE "THIS IS THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD just because there is a chance a ratairu could die deep in the drone lands.
---
How is this good for the game ? How does this involve more players shooting at each others ? Youhou, a timer was created in Delve. Surely now players can easily kill a structure no wait Goons still have an oppressive super cap fleet nothing can be done.
---
What's even worst is that it will pressure new comers into NS to basically have supers to counter NPC (although it seems like they hit structures in proportion to area density) while large alliance will just put a few supers of anoms and defending the structures, no big deal for them.
---
https://streamable.com/kg4uo
---
Ah yeah I never really thought of that maybe if I siphon all my sp to a new char I can correct some of what I did wrong only 25m sp do u think I can come close to what I'd be shooting for mayber even with some juice to keep my exploration up to par?
---
Actually this PvP should not be affected by PvE is pretty standard fare for him over the years.    But of course he does like to manipulate and yes this could be part of his attempt to meta game CCP into not being too aggressive with the Drifter hordes.   
---
As I said that they (the Drifters) are around and being dangerous is fine.
---
Like I'm only just diving back into eve and this is a leap with purpose and depth sure the whole "sandbox" shit but there not enough people to really drive that mayber this will change all of it iunno mayber cause I'm green as baby shit I have more hope for it.

---
I always suspected he was a farmer.
---
Doesn't matter what the counter is.
---
If something has the potential to destroy structures, which they can do, you can't just ignore them.
---
we've already found ways to kill them and stop them from setting timers in the first place.
---
Spy :)
---
Until they hit you with the doomsday! Not sure your caps and Supers work well then.
---
I wish people would stop worrying about ISK efficiency and just go out and have bloody fun shooting shit. I mean como  pretty much cost nothing.
---
I did, I came back a year ago to give it a spin  and stuck around because I got to shoot NC and PL, reset the game and I have zero reason to stay.
---
So good it must be fattening.
---
He looks like he just wants to be your friend tbh.
---
&gt; "unprecedented ceasefire between all of EVE Online's warring alliances."
---
Heh, I guess pcgamer never heard of the blue donut before.
---
Further nerf to fighters and titans gun application, supers locking speed, adding fatigue to the new gates. Removing a timer to all structures except maybe fortizars and keepstars. Damage cap on structure is now just a reduction of damage the more damage is applied past the cap. That kind of stuff.
---
Does it changes anything to the current Imperium blob ? No, nothing will unless you make caps and supers useless. But is it about fucking up the Imperium or is it about creating content and more fun for players ?
---
if only an alliance with 40k+ members would be able to form 40-50 t1 destroyers to kill/scare them off to save your structures.
---
I wonder what their plan was if this backfired. It could've been a last ditch attempt to reinvigorate the game.
---
Why spin it?  On the previous deployment to 6R last summer the "narrative" reason for returning home was partly "the fcs are burning out".
---
&gt; Anything you do to nerf nullsec
---
That's plain wrong there are plenty of things that will not impact smaller entities compared to larger ones.
---
I wonder how average free to play mmo retention rates are. My guess is not that great either. Anyone have any numbers ?
---
https://www.superdataresearch.com/understanding-mmo-retention/
---
This article suggest that rate might be as low as 3%
---
Not sure about the data
---
thats why you deathclone back from the as of nowhere
---
I just have a question, what big destruction happened from the drifters ? Is any Keepstar or fort in hull timer ? Have they wiped a few supers ?
---
Nobody knew that would be the case when this started happening did they.  I mean nobody even knew if it was a bug or not.
---
Given the 4% retention rate, it appears the blob warfare newbro version isn't keeping new players in the game either.  The game, fundamentally, is pretty boring.
---
Which only works once a day...
---
Give an example.
---
If you are running a dozen or more 23/7 vni pilots it leaves little time to aquire the elusive PAP.
---
We can, very easily, now that we're back near said structures.
---
Provi doesnt even have caps
---
Let me guess, trade hub in Jita will be the first victim.
---
*"We have to systematically unwind some of these things to bring about conflict again and make it scary again and  think we need to get moving on that. I would rather do the wrong thing and cause havoc rather just watch it in fear and \[think\]  - what do we do. I don't like the idea of kicking the anthills and put them aflame but in the absence of any idea, that's what needs to happen"*
---
For those that cant listen to the video.his preamble to that statement is roughly :
---
* Mistake 1 was making mineral resources symmetrical across the map, which stopped pact making and aggression over resources.
---
* Mistake 2 was sov which became stagnant bar a few areas
---
* Player count is stagnant and with a fixed map. That means "elements" don't "uncouple" 
---
He then talks about 
---
* "f\*cking up" Mineral distribution
---
* Doing something with Sov, he says he doesn't have an answer but it provides "too much control and comfort"
---
* Local chat is providing more "control"
---
I agree. I remember listening to this and thinking - something is coming. His body language shows that he is hiding something, foot swinging, touching his face.
---
you can fit a rifter with dual ancil tank like this vigil and be cancer aswell :P
---
"Shall we play a game?"  
---
An evolving AI, its thought algorithms trained on everything it has been reading on r/Eve for years, finally deciding to join the game.  
---
What if they *are* Reddit?!
---
no bud, you're up north, you clone jump back, deal with the drifters that it took you guys all of 8 hours to figure out, then you jump back north 19 hours later without skipping a single northern timer. 
---
Rinse and repeat.
---
you didn't have to take your entire super fleet back south to deal with them, you could have kept burning up north, acting like its impossible to fight in 2 places at once in modern eve is kinda dumb. Carrier and Dread stashes back home that you almost definitely have would have more than covered the work.
---
it seems really hard for you to admit the call to go home was an over reaction, but i guess somebody shooting at you is what drove you into the arms of a 50,000 man coalition in the first place so I probably shouldn't be so shocked.
---
19 hours later and you've missed a bunch of stuff. What the fuck are you taking about?
---
job done.
---
Well my alliance did it   and holded it succesfull for more then a month  it was fun but the enemy called entire nc and pl etc we where outnumbered and outgunned but we had fun and now we are planning on our next move into null to take sov
---
100% this comment right here.
---
Raitaru is cheap and cheerful way to start out. Astra's are more defensible but if someone wants to knock it over you would struggle either way tbh. Just keep it fueled and you should be good.
---
But VNI will be change into pvp ship on next update
---
"Risk" is probably a correct word, and even when that risk amounts to local God randomly "rocks-fall-everyone-die"-ing your stuff, there is some sort of counterplay, I guess (accept losses, build more, for example... bleh). But I'm not sure I can call that engaging or interactive.
---
Unless interesting tactics to beat drifters will emerge, leading to actually cool battles as opposed to "drop more on them", which can trivially be countered by NPCs not limited in anything as long as they are supported by GM's console commands, I'm afraid I won't get what's everyone is so excited about.
---
That's kinda the nature of fighting against a player armed with GM's console. If he wants you to lose, you lose. If you win, that's because you was allowed too. The question is, can he make entire thing entertaining enough that you don't care about this?
---
Further nerf to fighters and titans gun application, supers locking speed. A much bigger nerf in anomalies and moon extraction time will force large entities to spread meaning that smaller entities will have more options to harass them since the super cap will be smaller and generally speaking finding content will be much easier.
---
Is the new drifter ganking mechanic detectable with intel/ avoidable or do they just warp straight to you from nowhere?
---
Yea  they could hold their own sov if they did some effort
---
Spy alt that was deployed says differently. But to clarify. These were not official ops, just groups of people going home after the S1- keep died. Post has been edited as such.
---
i for one think the drifters have a freakin cool naming convention.
---
I agree about the faction forts though, i think their removal was kind of sad since they are historic relics. But I suppose players kill them too, such is life.
---
Only time will tell if we will remember this as the "biggest over-reaction in 2019" or a step that was needed (I hope the last one, because it means that Drifters need a bit more than t1 destroyers to get rid of them)
---
Tinfoil aside, the Imperium retreating at this point might benefit the North (unless they get burned more by the drifters), but that being said, I still think this is awesome for the game.
---
There was no announcement and nobody outside of CCP knows what is happening or how far they will go (doesn't stop anyone from running around like a headless chicken and making predictions though)
---
If this is staying and becomes a threat big enough to stop empires from having a campaign on the other side of the map, I would say it is a good thing.
---
astra is fine as long as you keep it fueled. forgot to fuel mine and into the dumpster it went.
---
My dick is now in outer space
---
it is clearly not.. :)
---
(https://zkillboard.com/character/3019582/)[Check this zkill to see what the drifters are killing].
---
I know for sure they killed a least a hel and an Ansiblex.
---
&gt; force large entities to spread
---
Spread how much?  Goons, for example, live in Delve, Fountain, Querious and Period Basis.  That's 4 regions.  TAPI have more I believe.  Just how spread out do you want us?
---
This is notwithstanding the fact that large entities like Goons can run locust fleets, where they go and harvest max fracks in other regions.
---
War was already over after last KS was burned down. Move ops started after drifter attacks. Pace is totally normal and not unpleasant at all - actually it would be nice to move even faster and not spending so much time waiting. Protecting structures from drifters is actually nice new content - we don't really mind. There really is no panic. You just wish for it :D
---
TBF, any ADCU fit Enyo will dumpster the 'all gank no tank' standard blaster Hecate. I've seen an Enyo do in a Caracal before too.
---
1 Delve
---
or better: "kill a ship". you WILL lose a few in the process.
---
Or jump their titans instead of bridging.
---
Yet all the whiney nerds bought the pack anyway. 
---
I know I did.
---
Lol ccp bashing the big bois
---
Then 5 minutes later another fleet is called to attack more structures in the north :thonking:
---
Anything that causes this much salt from nullbears is good in my book.  My only real complaint is that NPCs seem to be getting more pvp content than actual players these days :(
---
It's going to end before anything meaningful changes. And even if it doesn't an NPC plague is just covering up the problems.
---
What EVE needs is for CCP to make the necessary balance and mechanic changes that they've been avoiding for 3 years out of fear that they might upset some people. The current state of citadel mechanics and capital warfare is not sustainable, both will just keep getting worse.
---
I believe you. [But your leadership states otherwise.](https://twitter.com/TheMittani/status/1144355046785765376)
---
very good job boys ! keep em coming
---
I don't think you should talk about Boat like that, though his boobs are impressive.
---
Astra is worth the bit extra bc it can shoot back.
---
Baaaawing f1 monkeys getting their krabbing destroyed :D. Best. Thing. Ever
---
No sympathy from me.... brought it on yourself bringing some tradh monkey into your life
---
I mean it's there if you search for it.  I don't, so I've never seen it.  What you do with your spare time is none of my business of course.
---
We all have suggested this before and its been brought up many times.
---
Make organization really penalizing to their wallets.
---
Large blocs already earn a ton of ISK through their Keepstars, iHubs and stuff but the maintenance bill they receive from Concord is purely peanuts.
---
The cost of maintenance should exponentially increase, by a huge factor. It shouldn't be costing them a couple billion for a whole region, but cost should go into hundreds of billions.
---
This way, Alliances cannot sustain to hold large regions if they don't have the numbers and efficient money mechanism, if they do, well their wallet gets equally hurt.
---
There should also be s mechanism for establishment of Rental Alliances which gives hosts some feasibility, in downside however, it means 50% of rental income goes to Concord.
---
Lastly, seeing how this sleeper thing was really nice. What I would like to see that in the case payments are not met, Concord launches a brutal incursion to seize your assets or destroy them.
---
Pretty simple. If you don't want to hurt the small guy, the penalties should increase exponentially and not linearly. Not rocket science.
---
Come to Tribute. We're setting up a sort of Carribean of Independents. :)
---
You mean like FF14 : throw a big meteor (litteraly), close game, rework your copy and open again ?
---
These are highsec drifters, not wormhole drifters
---
wermt I think is probably half and half or 60/40 in favor of high sec pubbies versus krab alts
---
I'm not sure if ncdot has an explicit policy prohibiting in alliance krabbing, or the corps do, or they just prefer to have their own space, but they have a lot more krab alt corps than we do in pl. we've never been discouraged from krabbing on in alliance toons. a few people in pl have corps in wermt but they mostly only have those because of the way billing works for rentals - you pay from a rental corp to the exec corp, iirc, so you need to have a corp to rent, but the krabbing is pretty much all done on pl toons. it's also handy for people to manage krab structures via alt corps if they don't have the roles for it in their pl corp, which are fairly strictly controlled, particularly in snigg who own most of our structures
---
b0t I couldn't say with much precision but from what I've seen it's much more overwhelmingly renter mains than krab alt corps
---
&gt; Spread how much? Goons, for example, live in Delve, Fountain, Querious and Period Basis. That's 4 regions. TAPI have more I believe. Just how spread out do you want us?
---
Goons are in Delve and PB and small part of Querious with 30k players, INIT rents Fountain and live in small part of Querious too. TAPI rent how many regions (or gave for free) ? If they need to double that and eject trash like Gotg I'm all fine with it. That's what should happen. And once they live spread in 6 regions you will have to spread defense and super cap umbrella will be much weak. In short, much easier content, less safety.
---
&gt; This is notwithstanding the fact that large entities like Goons can run locust fleets, where they go and harvest max fracks in other regions.
---
Great, let them do that. The more away they have to go the better.
---
&gt; How will a nerf to Titans and Supers affect the big blocs that can field hundreds of them, compared to small blocs that can't?
---
If supers can't fuck with subcaps it means you can bring subcap to whale / ref small structures.
---
&gt; Nullsec is NOT too big.
---
sure bud. once i was glad when i met people to fight. now i am already glad to meet people.
---
The indy window can be a buggy mess and this happens frequently.  Take one of the materials out of the hanger and hit submit - should trigger a refresh
---
Retard hell die to NPC on a regular basis and woh an whole ansiblex ? That's like a whole 1.6bil, I'm not sure Horde could handle such a terrible loss !
---
&gt; Small corp moving into wormhole space. 
---
let me guess, from null-sec?
---
just sad they werent able to before....
---
"bla bla bla more convenient bla bla have only 20 hours / week to game bla bla infrastructure bla bla muh friends"
---
Better start manufacturing those High-Grade Salty implants. Looks like the demand is skyrocketing.
---
"oh no, drifters.... Attacking our important structures... We need to head home.... And mine-i mean kill the drifters. Can we go home now?"
---
Raitarus primary use is as a coalition level bookmark with tethering.
---
Industry is just a small side line.
---
Well, alright then. You did it well.
---
Half of the war is propaganda in that manner Drifters have already won this lol.
---
although tbh I would shit a brick if an npc lit a cyno
---
I mean, inasmuch as there's been time for such things to have happened. This literally started a day or so ago, be patient.
---
Yes, because it's all about right now, and not about planning for the future, right?
---
You're generally on the mark, but id like to point out I never heard of outposts getting reinforced or jump bridges getting destroyed by rats back in he day. It's less an ebb and flow, and more flood tide right now.
---
Super will be fine with fax support, life was very simple there for capital pilots now they have added a little spice to the mix.
---
Personally I think it's great the best pilots will adapt and lead the rest will just bitch that they can't play with their i win buttons anymore.
---
Hi small group here. We can promise you it going to hurt you more then us.
---
Spy account you mean :p
---
It's not about handling the loss. It's that the loss can exist to begin with.
---
What a crazy bitch, if she gave in she could be a phenomenal eve player. I bet she would seduce and betray anyone leaving ashes behind.
---
Well why is everyone making it like it's the best thing in the world and it's going to whipe so many structures and there will be so much destruction that it will fix the economy then ?
---
&gt;I don't, so I've never seen it.
---
This has to be the most desperate "I don't even know what you're talking about" in history.
---
Then you aren't playing because of the time you put into your characters.
---
 You're playing because the game is fun.
---
Yes there is chance of loosing random 2 timers structures if you don't defend them. Reddit moral goes up !
---
The game however, not so much.
---
What I'm hoping for is that this invasion is the "excuse" to implement changes on those and/or another significant core mechanics that need some serious rework.
---
... because hope is a thing that exists?        
---
A shocking concept to an r/eve poster, to be sure.
---
Of course. 
---
And maybe that's the goal.
---
Which is only fun because of the assets I have at my disposal, which I have accumulated over the last few years.
---
dat buuuurn
---
because it takes weeks to travel back to delve right?
---
NC and PL would still be around to shoot.
---
Sounds like you might have even more reason to stay.
---
Why would your fun go away?
---
Haha this is so awesome! Loving it. Thank you for doing this CCP. Eve needed a shakeup, and there needs to be some strong environmental force for apex predators of eve (no matter if they're called Goons or PL).
---
And to anyone saying this isn't a sandbox, it still is. CCP just changed the sand type :)
---
Somehow, if it's actually fun, you'd still be having fun if everyone were running around in cheap frigates.
---
Not really.  I literally haven't.
---
Dig a little bit and realize there is no hope to have if it doesn't do anything of value.
---
The previous comment definitively made you look like an uncultured swine.
---
you overthink it, EVE 99% hype 1% actual difficulty. You will be fine.  Just dont waste your time in high sec, if you want to make isk go straight to low sec.
---
+1. Thank you for doing this CCP. Eve needed a shakeup, and there needs to be some strong environmental force for apex predators of eve (no matter if they're called Goons or PL).
---
Well Hilmar said at eve down under that CCP should do more risky random stuff... First act was turn drifters up to 11 lol
---
Given timezones and the amount of assets... Yes. It took 2 weeks to get up to kqk to begin with.
---
Actually I think I saw a Ansiblex gates destroyed by diamond rats before hand:
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77101882/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77101882/) 
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75926748/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75926748/) 
---
There was two, the NCDOT. one was the one I was thinking about.
---
So far we have had one destroyed by the Drifters, though I had heard that a lot of stuff was reinforced, the Fraternity Keepstar being the most notable.
---
This is the one that was destroyed, and it is only one so far:
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77498342/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77498342/) 
---
So the jury is still out in terms of impact, though I have read that a lot of structures were put into timers.
---
Along the lines of drifters attacking structures and since you're now on CSM...How about floating the idea of low power structures not having a timer? Will reduce the number of structures in space over time and will mean more cost keeping them in high power meaning less isk floating around.
---
Too late to only allow citadels to be placed on a planet to limit how many can go in one system for example
---
I also agree on the faction forts. Nobody wants to see them die.
---
Fuck everything else though
---
We DeFeNdEd EvErY StRuKtUr GoN BeS
---
Must, resist, making another PI account.
---
&gt; you will have to spread defense and super cap umbrella
---
You see here's the problem - it's the same problem we always see on reddit and elsewhere.  No account is taken of Human psychology when these "new" (old) ideas are floated.  
---
Just how many targets do you think are going to undock for you in shiny PvE ships if you weaken the defensive ability of large blocs?  The number of kills will probably go down, simply because the number of risk averse players (let's face it, I'm not going to super rat if there's a chance I'll die even if I do all the right things - 14b is a lot of isk to earn ratting - it takes many, many hours of utter tedium).
---
People who want to do that can't do it in small groups now (no umbrella).  They still won't be able to if you weaken the umbrella.  Nobody will.  But whatever the meta then becomes, the big blocs will embrace and extend it, as they always do, in ways smaller entities cannot compete with.
---
#BUT WE DID IT BETTER THAN YOU
---
  - Goon shitposters 2019
---
Well don't get me wrong i feel like I'm the "4%" of fuck heads that leave after 1month I've played off and on since 2013 I have almost maxed scanning skills for data and relic sites last time I played for a long time was back when u could explore with a Taranis and I'd get a bit of cheese PvP in versus lil anathemas and such
---
It won't, reddit just like to reeeeeeeeee
---
Wait...I thought it was consent allows docking?
---
Thanks u/GrassWaterDirtHorse for the drifter
---
#OH... OH NO
---
That's my point; good find about the diamond rats though. I've been in null 6 or 7 years now, and I've never seen something like this. Certainly never heard of anything close to it from before my time; other than a couple legends of POS gone skynet.
---
Ultimately, I don't mind, it'll be a wild ride if ccp can curate it on that fine line between trivial and overbearing.
---
Wealth and security are great IRL. That's not what I'd look for in EVE.
---
Probably?
---
[laughs in Australian accent]
---
&gt; *-Random with a preference for bot space
---
Did you mean: spawn chance is weighted based on rolling 7 days average of total bounties in ISK and ore mined in m3 in a given system? I assume this could actually work in interesting way.
---
Yeah that's what is. Bait
---
You are where I am on this, I find the FOB rats in hisec a lot of fun and upped my game to deal with them.   I just wish more people would stop being so negative and just do it.   I find them perfectly good game play.
---
Lmao
---
&gt;Frankly the whole SP system is pretty bad,
---
Yes and in typical CCP fashion, they make it even worse by adding skills which kind of fuels the idea that there must be some way to "catch up".
---
You dont need to be allied to jump a freighter around, you mangosquizzle.
---
MFW NPC's scare you
---
&gt; Just how many targets do you think are going to undock for you in shiny PvE ships if you weaken the defensive ability of large blocs?
---
They don't undock big ships, they are at a loss of income. They do it, they are at an increased risk. It's a loss/loss for large alliances.
---
&gt; The number of kills will probably go down
---
Players need to rat. They might downgrade from supers to carrier or rattle but they need to rat. If they want safety they should actively defend their space rather than rely on supers. Active defense fleet mean content for roams and small group harasing. Win for small group, loss for large group.
---
&gt; People who want to do that can't do it in small groups now (no umbrella). They still won't be able to if you weaken the umbrella. Nobody will. But whatever the meta then becomes, the big blocs will embrace and extend it, as they always do, in ways smaller entities cannot compete with.
---
Smaller entites already can't live and even with all the best changes in the world will still blue up other entities. But saying "well large entities will just adapt and overcome" is retarded. Changes aren't made to remove large alliance, they are here to provide more content. Many small entities don't want sov, they want content because that's how you recruit as a small entity.
---
Repeat this after you successfully defend your structure.
---
you are right. BUT this is still a sandbox and not an arena game with fair starting points. you can lay traps or outnumber your opponent. there are so many ways to overcome the bought advantages just as there are many ways to overcome the quantity with quality.
---
that's what hampers the "p2w" nature of eve
---
Exactly
---
The alternative, at least to some extent, is to merge skills and make support skills mostly pretrained so training actually focuses on what the player wants to fly instead of mandatory bullshit.
---
why leaving after even day 1 , makes you a fuck head ?
---
EVE is a fun game but far from the greatest. I do a bit of everything , came for the PVP , PVP sucked, stayed because of social aspect and fun PVE.
---
MEGA already existed. It was a weak attempt by a German Europhile to hop on the MAGA Hype and look edgy and cool (to fish more youth votes). It failed spectacularly.
---
I get ya just need to commit and set proper achievable goals ya
---
&gt;Fact is most people will say "fuck it" and quit because of the SP system and the insanity of catching up.
---
It is also mostly a fact that for at least 10 years, the claim was that "SP dont matter". CCP(?) and others needs to eat a ton of shit for that crap. Just saying.
---
Hahaha
---
My point is all new MMOs fail. If they wanna make money, they need an eve battle royale and an eve autochess, use eve assets to jump on the band wagon, make some cash.
---
I thought all the rest were Dave-Stark????
---
&gt; the statistics of the amount produced things vs destroyed 
---
This isn't totally a representation of overproduction through.
---
A lot of stuff is "lost" to inventory management. Just having billions spread across space you're never going to go retrieve.
---
I want this to become true! Loving the content at the minute!
---
Nobody wants to live and fight in lowsec, not even NPCs
---
Remember about extra 750k sp for buddy account
---
The fuckers evolving and uploading into other games.
---
Hey man! Check you PM! :-)
---
Except we know you all have alts back in delve anyway.
---
Why the fuck would CCP need an excuse to fix their game?
---
&gt; Small alliances, it's a bit harder.
---
So far, they haven't attacked small alliances. So we don't know that this argument is entirely valid.
---
Don't let this distract you from the the fact that in 1966, Al Bundy scored four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, Bubba "Spare Tire" Dixon.
---
Not really from anywhere particular. Do a bit of everything and have only just made the corp. Do you think I'm from nullsec because of the drifters?
---
Last two seasons of enterprise were fucking good, those before that were better than discovery at least
---
just undock and don't sweat it. this is still a game meant to be fun. over 50% of the playerbase only play with 1 account. you also don't need much SP. exploration (in null and WH) is great content for new players, it teaches a lot and you can use the isk to fund frigate pvp in FW which teaches you even more.
---
also: join a corp and don't hesitate to switch corps if you don't fit. the hardest part in eve i finding the right people to play with.
---
&gt; The number of kills will probably go down, simply because the number of risk averse players
---
How so?
---
Would you not undock at all because it isn't safe enough to super rat? Or will you still undock in a smaller ship?
---
Google what sandbox means idiot , it's only a sandbox if I can AFK mine all day while fucking ur mom
---
I think it's safe to say they will just spawn in system might be able to see them on scan but expect to be taken by surprise.
---
Saltwater is a lot better at generating rust than pure h2o tho
---
&gt;whatabout
---
I posted this tactic like yesterday. Trashers or talwars are much better, even don't invest in meta fits unless you can supply mods faster than producing them.
---
1-2 probably yes but then you get mini doomsdays from them and tons of dps and your super will die.
---
You can do it but don't expect to pay for omega with farming.
---
It's doable but not a good idea to waste your time competing with rorqual multiboxers/super ratters/other afk multiboxer crabs.
---
The plex prices are set by the time it takes them to farm 2 bil isk.
---
If you get omega by buying it from CCP or even as an alpha, you can enjoy the game with or without also farming for some isk.
---
Says you
---
Do not use capitals WTF.        
---
This are not to be touched by any expensive ship.
---
I meant "excuse" lore-wise, or as something that triggers a change of core mechanics, an event that reshapes the world they created. Not as "a reason" to do so, those are obvious.
---
Is that more clear?
---
Just npc game mechanics.  Similar to reputation in WoW
---
you can deathclone as often as you want just dont be the idiot that sets his homestation to something retarded
---
me too
---
sounds like being an F1 monkey is harder than most people think 
---
all those problems and hard to solve issues
---
Supercapital gank*
---
We have been talk about this for years now..nothing changed and I dont believe for a second CCP didnt see this coming.
---
Caps far too cheap far too easy to make
---
Citadels ridiculously cheap for to easy to build.far too easy and quick to anchor. Seriously someone can knock up a massive space station in 24hrs? Jeez
---
A keepstar should take months to build and a month to anchor for example
---
also it has fighter tubes  wich normaly only  l and xl struktures have.
---
Ok !
---
When I first ran across drifters I got my ass walloped in my blinged out mission running Raven. I've had some serious disdain towards them but not anymore thanks to all this salt. Still would love to blow them up though. I've always wanted to solo a drifter ship in a subcap. Not sure if it is possible, but if it is does anyone have any pointers?
---
ThIs iS aCtUaLlY GoOd FoR gOoNs
---
Hope that you will have your issue solved.
---
That was a knee jerk reaction to a surprise.  I’d hazard a guess they’ll resume their campaign shortly
---
what a sad state eve must be in if you call that weeks long uncontested structure grind a "war"
---
This is so meta
---
...................... i'd pay npcs to do the boring uncontested structure grind your FCs and linemembers are burning out on
---
Idk Triangle man is 2/2...
---
Last time when small alliances crying about \*we cant hold sov, big boys dont give us chance!!!\* Fozzie Sov comes
---
So basically you can keep all your stuff if you are not subbed/logged in?
---
No, it's Hel
---
This drifter looks like young Putin.
---
Jump Clones are a thing, you were going back anyway and now are bitching about this only because you were told to by someone who doesn't even play.
---
A few days ago most goons were talking about just leaving the Superfleet behind with clones to helicopterdick the north any time you wanted; now you moved back to form fleets of disposable t1 dessies...
---
Cut the crap and/or stop being so fucking stupid Dave.
---
We took the entire super fleet north.
---
I personally only have 1 omega anyway.
---
You can’t just let all those half finished titans die to some unknown new over mechanic.  
---
Quit being small brain
---
Yeah, but after the first one you'll be death cloning to the station you're already in...
---
But you said you only need destroyers to stop the drifters. Not supers.
---
yeah guys keep throwing money at this dying game. totally not sunk cost fallacy.
---
What the hell have you got against corgis? You beast!
---
he left to work somewhere else and CCP didn't replace him.
---
Not sure who told you that, but I'm nowhere near burning out and I haven't seen any others say they are. Even more so when we keep having to make multiple fleets per op...
---
That's a good TCDU
---
" Why would your fun go away? " How would you find it run to rebuilt a character you already built? Its not like the content would be new, or the skills different or the ships anything other than they are now, why pay for the exact same experience twice? If I wanted that I'd go sign up for wow classic for fuck sake.
---
What crap?
---
Ccp just released an AI that goes around Reinforcing structures.
---
You got a choice of going and pvping or playing whack a mole.
---
People will always complain when it's not easy and they have to do something...
---
Yes, especially if you want to solo explore. I play solo most of the time and multi-boxing doesn't equal winning. I got jumped by a guy multiboxing 4 accounts recently and he ran after I killed the first two.
---
well then it took a whole two days to achieve the goal, queue the new expansion let down.
---
As a wise man once said "How the fuck are your enemies supposed to know what to do if you don't know what the fuck you're doing?"
---
Thanks for this
---
Don't goons pride themselves of having thousands of people that enjoy playing whack-a-mole? Put the Incursion's FCs to do this shit and keep doing whatever the fuck you want vOv
---
Aren’t you fucking genius
---
&gt;. I mean the big alliances can easily fight off dozens of drifters. Small alliances, it's a bit harder.
---
Well thankfully the drifters seem to be focused around high structure density, which isnt small alliances, so who cares.
---
Well, stuff like that is how it should probably done instead of spawning or appearing out of nowhere for no reason.
---
Incursions make isk, structure bashing costs enemies isk.
---
Mindless whack a mole with npcs that have no value as an activity save to stop them being a nuisance .... no thanks. It's part of the game, I'll partake, doesn't mean the game has been made better.
---
Nah, it was just a joke. Maybe a bad one.
---
Have you never started a second character?
---
And who is to say nothing else would change in a reset?
---
Good goals are designed in steps, not one-offs.
---
i WAs jUsT prEtenDInG tO Be ReTaRdEd
---
Unpopular opinion: Fozziesov is extremely cool if the timers are contested.
---
Uncontested fozziesov is boring, but so is uncontested bashing (the way it was before) or basically uncontested anything is boring.
---
right? you don't need to excuse yourself for something you never did
---
So why does moving the entire super fleet north, or omega matter?
---
Why would you need to bring all those omega piloted supers back to delve to ship into alpha ships?
---
Clowns to left of me, jokers to the right, here I am; stuck in the middle with you
---
Were all literally turtling more now than ever so if you mean to say this drifter shit is inspiring undock and complicated PvP campaigns you’d be more wrong than I thought it to be possible.
---
Enyos also kill caps pretty easily too
---
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right, here I am;stuck in the middle with you
---
Make sure you take all your gear and purple mods with you into your new wh home!

 😜
---
Round 1...
---
&gt;to wipe out all the null 
---
I get the meme, but I don't want those mouthbreathers rushing into J space
---
eyy you scary wormhole people would have a field day + I can't afford the good stuff :)
---
They are bust making themselves feel at home. They don't like gates in their systems.
---
I am gay too
---
If you don't mind, tell me more about them? All that comes to mind is I've seen word about them competing with players for the local asteroid belts.
---
IF ONE timer is lost, that means there is danger of losing the structures.
---
This means, you now HAVE TO defend them or lose them. Yes, thats PVE, not PVP.
---
But it gives opportunities to drop on these generated timers.
---
For example: suddenly a sotyio is reinforced because the defenders don't defend the shield timer. That gives opportunity to take out a sotyios service modules with only ONE SINGLE TIMER!
---
Also, the blueball capability is vastly decreased against drifters. You never know who will suddenly piggyback and drop on your defense fleets...
---
Quotation marks. But you didn't quite anyone so they didn't make sense.
---
What you just described was the original vision for titans. It didn't work (obv.) Anyway, there'd still be too many of them.
---
The problem is the human psyche or herd mentality - safety in numbers. Meaning large corporations, big alliances and massive coalitions. While you and I understand that this isn't good for the game, the average player simply does not give a fuuuuuuuuuuuuck and will happily form up in a fleet with a few hundred other players, press F1 and then die or go home when it's over, if it gives him the chance to shoot at NPCs in peace.
---
Because alphas are garbage, let's not be silly.
---
Yep ... and posting
---
&gt; No space in Eve is safe and you should consider anything deployed or undocked in space as free game.
---
Yeah sure, but the danger should come from players not NPCs.
---
The question is, what's next though.
---
I have 8 across 4 accounts, paying to rebuild them all back to what they are now does not sound like fun to me at all.
---
The Mittani gets salty from sugar.
---
I honestly don't think he's wrong. It'll all comes down to CCP handling the event well enough that people will have fun flowing with it.
---
Without proper fleet composition and lead it would likely get toasted.
---
Their consent isn't a factor.
---
the satisfaction of building a sandcastle
---
aside from ansiblex structures it's basically impossible for them to have killed anything yet. it only started a couple of days ago, wait until all the low power raits and astras come out.
---
No? That isn't what it was at all. That shit happened in, like, 2012.
---
Exactly I'm waiting to see if the AI does go back and attack each timer.
---
Ill add to the salt pile with my own dumb opinions. The drifter ai is dumb and they have always fed themselves to structures. The only reason these rats are a threat is because they are bullshit OP. They may as well be concord. If the rats power level was normal and they maybe dropped loot this event would be fun but instead ccp are just concording players in null.   This is a textbook example of badmin bullshit
---
Another satisfied customer o7 thank you for choosing WiNGSPAN!
---
More prey is allways good, ain't it?
---
Any intelligence that spends years on this sub will know to stay away
---
I still think it's a early assault force like a scouting party before the horde
---
Civ 3 was peak Civ.
---
LOL, we had nullsec incursions interrupt sov wars before.
---
Every skillpoint you get after you hit 50mil SP will get diminishing returns and if an injector is going to take you above 50 mil, the SP you get will be calculated at both rates do you neither cheat or get cheated.
---
It doesn't matter if there are a thousand players in a fleet if they're flying ships that can be countered. You could have 1000 people in battleships and lose 300 of them to 20 people in bombers if you're not careful. Or one single guy in a command dessie could boosh your fleet apart and cause havoc.
---
The problem is capitals are vulnerable to *nothing* except more capitals. Once that design got combined with injectors and rorquals it completely broke PVP at all levels of the game. That's what CCP needs to address.
---
How can I find more information about the math behind warp stabilizers/equalizers vs disruptors/scramblers? The only post about it were from 2008.
---
you can extract omega skills and levels of skills that are exlusive to omega as an alpha but you cannot extract any alpha available skills/levels.
---
I'm just gonna say that they didn't talk about this invasion at all with the CSM, so if there are huge mechanical changes to the game, CCP is just doing it on their own understanding of how the game works without input from us. 
---
Which, historically, is how you end up with things like the release Rorqual (which we told them was bad, but they ignored us).
---
Naturally you want your "home" to be as risk free as possible. You want your enemies' home to be dangerous. It keeps them on the back foot.
---
Still, game mechanics don't have to cater for what people want all the time. Burn it all down \o/
---
I'm not saying there isn't going to be *some* opportunity to achieve *some* damage. But people won't let sotoyos go into hull tier they will defend it. At worst people will deploy some structure less far away than they currently do but what's going to prevent supers being dropped against anyone quite fast ? Supers are already being dropped on people whaling so opportunistic structure reinforce won't go any better, especially with spies and seeing large fleet on structure grid.
---
That's piss poor compare to all changes that could happen and improve the game *for attacking players*. Actual guarantee PvP.
---
agreed :D
---
Someone is salty
---
yeh if you remove the normally £9.99 sub for the omega from the equation its even more rediculous but this only applies when applying it to characters your already subbing otherwise its a negated figure, which is why i acted as if it wasnt there in terms of the calculation as if some one is buying multiple its more likely they are making throw away accounts once they used it on there mains and alts that they have active subbed
---
you're missing the nuance:
---
interesting unknown element about a game that was solved years ago: cool
---
same old mega coalition curbstomping (ie bashing undefended structures): boring
---
These tears are delicious! Cry more!
---
IMO the core reason isn't that Caps aren't vulnerable - It's that Capitals are completely, and entirely self supporting and as a result obsolete subcaps;
---
You need webs and points? Don't bring a tackle ship, bring Support Fighters
---
Need to deal AoE damage? Don't use bombers, use a Boson
---
Need to camp a gate with high scan res? Don't use a cruiser, use a NSA Carrier
---
Need to deal with hard to hit targets at long range? Don't use a subcap, use a LR Gun titan
---
Need to get tackle off of your capitals? Just refit those Titans to HAWs instead
---
All of this shit need to be fixed before subcaps will be relevant again IMO.
---
it'll be a big deal when we have to do it day after day, every day. the upkeep for stricture spam just went up dramatically.
---
This is EVE Online. The meta goes meta before anyone is even aware of the thing the meta is the meta for.
---
The salt is real!

i didn't know that. makes it even worse

2019, the Year where Goons couldn't just  JC back home to kill some rats because Mining Drone Specialization &gt; Infomorph Psychology
---
Wew
---
I mean the enthusiasm is there just the wrong way to go about it. 
---
At least you guys can build more!
---
Didn't want these sandcastles anyway.
---
Finally, a good Meiqur post this week
---
It was not.
---
Would be cool if they were not just normal Battleships but proper Drifter Emergency Response ones!
---
BTW, jump cloning remotely still incurs the cooldown, even if you're using citadels. The only way to beat the timer is to change to a clone in the same station.
---
That is the point, no sane person can blame the Imperium for maximizing the tools CCP gave them and being the biggest conglomeration of PvE-Players in EVE it was clear that a patch forcing EVERY alliance scale income to PvE grind contrary to the 13 years of balance before would benefit them unproportionally ... people said that in early 2017 before Lifeblood went live, but got vote brigaded to hell ...
---
And doesn't know about Darth Jar Jar either. 
---
Lucas was a pussy.
---
He cornered the market on mittens and has made it his goal to eliminate any competition.
---
We need more of you in Goonswarm
---
You would rather pvp, but refuse to, and instead pray for pve to save you.
---
How bad at Eve do you have to be? Lol
---
Thanks everyone, except for the idiot from goons who thinks I can use hacks. Plenty of people with more skills than me. I'll try evejobs

Super umbrella was/is up North. So not sure what you are on about.

---
the idea of giving newbro's a way to grind sp's would be very redeeming for keeping that newbro's playing, at least for a while. if the grind is not too boring.
---
a player starting new just to hit sp walls all the time for things he wants to do with no other way than use real money (for a game he's probably just checking out) or wait for days/weeks/months is not new player friendly.
---
doesn't have to be unreasonable, can be low enough so no vet cares about it (time/sp ratio), and ofc can be capped at something like the 5m SP alpha limit.
---
i'm pretty shure the % of staying alpha players and also the ones switching to omega would be way higher.
---
No it isn't.
---
Looting yet, salvage no.
---
&gt;Eve has always had titty streamers, but they usually have beards
---
This made me spit a mouthful of coffee at my monitor.   Take an upvote.
---
Max range Cerbs work well too, just fire on them outside of 150k, you can solo them this way
---
I'm in!
---
i refuse to pvp? what?  whoever you think im a member of, im sorry to tell you, but im not....
---
Did no one get an in-game notifications
---
No you get that wrong. Lifeblood Patch forced PvE onto PvPers to get any relevant alliance/SRP scale income and by this unproportionally heavy favoured the group(s) with the most PvE-Players (coincidentally already the by far bigest group at that time). So PvE-players had the exclusive key to ultimate PvP power creep (multibox Rorqual mining) and PvPers were set back to low scale individual incomes. So the guys getting salty atm for PvE being "forced" upon them are in fact PvEers that are everything they are atm due to "forced PvE" that wanted to roflstomp these pesky PvP guys making their krabbing miserable for over a decade and now have to defend the infrastructure that they installed to abuse the weak mechanics CCP has implemented with Lifeblood.
---
PLEX
---
hey, its the guy that fed a titan and tried to petition it as a bug again!
---
"Act fast because this offer won't last!" is my big takeaway.  Wanna bet the pack is removed at the end of the month when  somebody's income deadline with Pearl Abyss is due?

Adapt or die.
---
Welcome in Eve Online.
---
lots of people who try our game leave real early so we need them to swipe their visa as soon as they step in the door
---
but next time we'll run this by the csm, scout's honor
---
again: free vs paid. what's so hard to undersand?
---
I've given up on Eve Online at this point, but I sure as fuck hope that, if not Hilmar, then at least *someone* at CCP is trying to push some (controversial) changes, because the current state will lead to the genuine death of the game. Whether this will happen, now that some Korean company is in charge, is doubtful, but I suppose it's good that the current situation is recognized.
---
So basically you have to maintian defense fleet against drifters, so even less time for you to go out, but still no more occassion for others to attack yo because lol super umbrella is still a thing.
---
So great for the game.
---
what criteria? there is huge difference between SP trained, extracted and sold on market and SP being created out of thin air and then sold for IRL $ without any limitiations.
---
plex is just another currency to prevent hyper inflation from direct isk to $ conversion
---
this will kill a lot of bot, and just for that, it s good :)
---
I'd like to congratulate CCP for being the first company to provide Non Consensual PvE that I can remember.
---
&gt;we're experimenting
---
Yeah, experimenting how far they can go again before another summer of rage.
---
&gt;EVE is filled with landmines that you just don't know about. Jita chat / contracts full of scammers, suicide gankers in trade hubs from free accounts to trade the loot to their mains at no penalty, spies in corps that report fits, locations etc of even smaller hi sec corps.
---
Lmao, please fuck off back to your highsec mining corporation.
---
If these are the "landmines" that you're so concerned about, go stuff yourself with a pineapple and serve yourself on 3 day old pizza.
---
so no content, got it. thanks to shitadels even a brain less monkey can safely move a JF through space.
---
asset safety needs to go. take care of your shit or lose it. simple as that
---
That's exactly right. Ships in Eve are meant to be balanced around being specialised for a specific role, but caps can do almost everything without any downsides - tackling with support fighters, locking quickly, hitting ships that are many times smaller, and they can do it all while being able to instantly teleport across the map.
---
An update, just tested the buddy link and  if u refer your self with your buddy link and then buy the pack you get 350 plex, 2 x 24h training and the skill extractor on the referring account aswell as the 2 x multi training and 500 plex on the new account! so you get 2b extra isk per star pack
---
This is some 10/10 hilarity. I hope they have the trigs and pirates get in on it too
---
So you cry when CCP adds the pack, and now you cry when CCP takes it off? With a playerbase like this, if I was CCP I would have a very hard time not deleting the game.
---
It's great, all the guys complaining about citadel proliferation are now getting their citadels bashed. All the unfit ones will die.
---
I don't play the game; but love reading stuff like these. This whole invasion must have sounded so sketchy for the first sightings, reminds me of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47V6jukf1lo
---
I know. I talked to CCP about this for 3 summits in a row, and nothing seems to have changed.
---
One of my first ever roams, i think in 2017 or early 2018, I went to delve in  a slicer. Needed to take 3 gates to join the gang I would be with. 2nd gate got instalocked by diamond blood raider rats. Was a sad day. Its all i know about these diamond rats)
---
It only affects null sec. New players start in high sec. Don't worry about the drifters.
---
they warp in
---
I'm not in one. Been in null for many years now.  I was reminiscing on the days. And.... with uhhh what was that... a reported 4% new player retention? I think  in a while, you will be stuffing your face with pizza with lack of players in EVE. You can act all cool as a cool kill mails bro, but... you can just as easily get those killmails in null..... so... why the hostility?
---
"we want new players to catch-up veteran soo we decided to sell 1M SP for 5$ and we don't understand why you whine about that"  
---
really i don't understand if they REALLLY want new players to catch up old one (and that's a good thing) why they dont add a SP multiplicator for low sp omega character and make those "bonus SP" impossible to extract  
---
or just make dailly/weekly quest for low sp character, idk but just dont monetize new players "Hey want some SP ? just give us your wallet" they used the same excuse when they introduce skill injector
---
Hek. Dirty minmatar are fucking druggies
---
Wouldn't it be funny if it ended with an all out drifter v trig war in low culminating in the construction of a gate to stain as the losing forces escape to safety?
---
It's all a dream, wake up sadic
---
Monsters. They should push loot boxes and gambling mechanics like the rest of civilized society!
---
That you know of.
---
That's the name, thanks. And those are not only used to quote something... sorry, too fucking early and I'm having trouble trying to explain what I meant in a different way.
---
Just from the goons.
---
Nullibears are salty because rats PvP better than they do.
---
Went a head and bought a Raitaru, should be enough to get me started if I don't get evicted within a week :)
---
Small groups with 3 structures have been hit.
---
A couple of citadels into reinforced mode is hardly an eviction.
---
Another fact is the complete anihilation of the alliance/SRP-scale income balance between nomadic PvP-Groups and member-heavy, static PvE-focussed groups with Lifeblood.
---
&gt; Would you not undock at all because it isn't safe enough to super rat?
---
Yes, I would not super rat if it wasn't safe to super rat.
---
&gt; Or will you still undock in a smaller ship?
---
I would undock in a smaller ship but you people also want local removed so even there it's a problem.  If I cannot rely on the umbrella and I cannot rely on intel, I cannot do PvE in null, or rather I should say we'd all go back to High Sec Level 4 mission running alts, which is what we used to do back in the old days.
---
It's rather hysterical.
---
I wish I could upvote this a thousand times more.
---
Well it's understandable, they didn't want nullblocks to know about it and prepare in advance, so not telling the CSM should be step 1.
---
Why would they have?  Small alliances don't hold sov and have structures in null, do they.  Simple probability means they're much more likely to attack Goons and Tapi than Darwinism.
---
more close to perfect ten
---
I make two accounts to upvote it more
---
Provi doing its random stuff, I see no reason to make a post about it because it's nothing new lol
---
This would be from Zathura: A Space Adventure from 2005, which is about a board game that takes kids into space.
---
&gt; Players need to rat.
---
Believe me, they don't.  There are other options, one of which is not playing Eve.
---
&gt; they are here to provide more content
---
That's my point.  The changes you make to provide "more content" will be used by larger groups to provide themselves with more content too, at the expense of smaller groups, as always.
---
Wait arent they blamed as Drifter Slaves by the Trigs ?
---
Yes he is not happy
---
That would be my preferred fix too, if they can find some meaningful role for capitals that isn't "shitting on subcaps".
---
This.    Take your time and have fun.    Make liberal use of the New Player Help chat channel.   Welcome to Eve.
---
I don't think calling them "the largest conglomerate of PVP players" is fair. They mostly consist of angry Krabs.
---
Yeah as a new player just starting you will likely not see any drifters unless you go out of your way to find them, you're all good newbro fly safe and welcome to eve
---
Awww bro yea. You's a tough bro. \*finger snap\*  I bet you're real formidable IRL too. There are 2 reasons you would take your stance. 
---
1. You don't want the game you are playing to succeed. 
---
2. You are upset about the amount of "free kills" being diminished so you can't pad your killboard. 
---
Wake up and smell the roses. 4.09% retention. 
---

---
Yes so it sounds like when they first arrive in the entry system ... assume it’s via wh ?? ... then then gate to outlying systems.
---
Anyone confirm?
---
Just going off of your sorry ass posting is all.
---
Many years with 27m SP?
---
If they really wanted to fix the problem, they'd pull it immediately from veteran accounts.  They didn't - because they want to incentivize people to rush out and give them some more cash right at the end of the month.  This is marketing 101 my friend, and if you're too naive and gullible to see it, that's your problem.
---
ur mom
---
Says the guy who was banned and still hangs out here. Get a life kid and stop RMTing.
---
Fucking up mineral distribution would help better than any of those ideas. If the Imperium chooses to over exploit a region like delve, they will face a rapid diminishing returns and other regions will increase in value as the stockpiles of minerals get out of balance.  
---
NPC pressure on infrastructure puts a lot of pressure on large groups which have placed too much focus on economic development. 
---
The mechanics of the ships and what happens in the battles is really a small factor in the shape of the universe. These groups are always going to exploit the advantages and there will always be advantages to exploit. Constantly hammering down every perceived imbalance is an endless task -- as we have already seen. The Imperium et.al. will simply switch the new strongest strategy and everyone will complain that they are unbreakable.
---
What are diamond rats?
---
no - if you are putting expensive shit in a structure you should make an initial "asset safety" purchase on said assets
---
I originally started playing in 08-09 around the end of highschool. In a way I'm happy I wasn't mature enough to play back then and came back now. I would hate to be a bitter vet.
---
The fuck has just happened. I got eve a few weeks back, and played for about a week. The  last 3 weeks have left me without my laptop, and when I come back everyone is screaming over an invasion? Any news would be helpful.
---
It’d be a pleasure to fly with you! 
---
Drop me a PM when you get a moment
---
This drifter isn't nearly fat or racist enough for the joke to work, but I appreciate the effort.
---
There was nothing good about Enterprise.  At least the opening them have you a warning of the shiftiness you were about to sit through
---
Stop complaining about "forced PvE", all you are atm is because of "forced PvE" (Lifeblood forcing ALL aliance/SRP scale income to multibox pve grind with rorquals). Get a grip on how a real PvP-Group felt after Lifeblood patched their SRP-income to zero in 1 day telling him with a raised middlefinger to go buy plex and inject rorquals to spend 75% of his online time with mining in the future.
---
As I've mentioned, I played EVE on n off. I've quit and come back to it about 3 times. Oh... uhh i guess it's 78 mil.  My bad. I was just pulling numbers off the top of my head.
---
Most of your "landmines" can literally happen to players of any age and are a big part of what makes this game different and awesome.
---
That being said, of course it might happen to new players more often, maybe this is an indicator that some of those things should be more clear, but to be honest, some people just need to touch that fire to see if it really burns.
---
Yes, it is frustrating as old player if people quit the game after ignoring your advice, but I can't come up with ways to teach them in a way that would make sure they listen.
---
What we are really missing IMO is in-game tools to organize small-medium sized player groups
---
motherfucker read my post - my suggestion is LITERALLY doing the same fucking thing except with triglavian ships, not drifters
---
\*hurrrr hes salty / mad / crying\*
---
no ya'll are just illiterate window lickers who completely whiffed on that second part where I'm all "\*WE SHOULD TOTALLY DO THIS WITH TRIGLAVIANS INSTEAD BC DRIFTERS ARE BORING\*"

Are you guys still saying you'll accept code alts and then wasting their time with an interview?

I guess it's a goid thing i started playing2 weeks ago 😁 i join at interesting times.
---
CCP has now become CCCP
---
Wrecking shot.
---
That would help! 
---
To be clear, I'm not complaining about myself hitting landmines. I can afford that at my stage of EVE life, I'm simply trying to solve the problem of player retention.
---
If they can't fight back, why are they in Nullsec?
---
&gt; Believe me, they don't. There are other options, one of which is not playing Eve.
---
Because they can't rat safely in a super ? Big loss.
---
&gt; That's my point. The changes you make to provide "more content" will be used by larger groups to provide themselves with more content too, at the expense of smaller groups, as always.
---
What wrong with large entities having content too ? Large entities are the biggest BLOPS people, the entities also doing whaling fleet, the one putting up content structure ... And I don't see how this is done *against* smallers entities, "smaller entities" almost doesn't exist already. The whole "large alliance will profite from any change anyway" is a useless one and generall comes from the one who have an advantage at things to stay of that way.
---
This might be the most sensible answer I've heard on the topic so far.
---
Big alliances don't go to war? 🤔
---
What was the last video linked here that had dubstep? That's done a pretty good job of going back to a niche genre.
---
I chuckled at this quite considerably.
---
Lets hope so. Null would do with several hundred trillion isk being torched
---
How many you got left?
---
&gt; Because they can't rat safely in a super ? Big loss.
---
Perhaps that's what they do to keep their accounts Omega.  Whatever.
---
&gt; What wrong with large entities having content too ?
---
In context, this was about things to improve QOL for small entities, implying anything that hits big ones is good for them.
---
Non consensual anal PvE at that.
---
That'd be cool if they knew what any of the problems were though - Go read the minutes from when we're begging CCP to add Low Power mode to structures, they had no idea of what problems they're causing, and still don't.
---
Not to mention all the historic doxxing, "BEEP BEEP I'M A TRUCK ETC."
---
1: dont use steam
---
2: this is a good deal. 500 plex gets you 1 month of in game time OR about 2.1 billion isk. 
---
3: the multiple training licenses get you a bunch more isk or you could get started on a PI or trading alt.
---
&gt; Perhaps that's what they do to keep their accounts Omega. Whatever.
---
Yes because you can't do any other form of isk making what so ever other than super ratting right !
---
&gt; In context, this was about things to improve QOL for small entities, implying anything that hits big ones is good for them.
---
No chances will impact only small groups and not large one. But if a change provide content for both what's wrong with that ? Again, "small entities" basically aren't a thing and never will because of N+1 and coalitons.
---
&gt; Fucking up mineral distribution would help better than any of those ideas. If the Imperium chooses to over exploit a region like delve, they will face a rapid diminishing returns and other regions will increase in value as the stockpiles of minerals get out of balance.
---
So they will move with their supers into another region, they another region clockwise. Prepare the next region while exploiting one. Big deal for them.
---
&gt; NPC pressure on infrastructure puts a lot of pressure on large groups which have placed too much focus on economic development.
---
Yeah and said economic development lead to titans and supers which will trash drifters. Except boring defense against NPC it doesn't change much for them, strategy wise it's still the best thing to do. Maybe not place so many structures but big deal for them.
---
&gt; The mechanics of the ships and what happens in the battles is really a small factor in the shape of the universe. These groups are always going to exploit the advantages and there will always be advantages to exploit. Constantly hammering down every perceived imbalance is an endless task -- as we have already seen. The Imperium et.al. will simply switch the new strongest strategy and everyone will complain that they are unbreakable.
---
It's not about who is the strongest entity in the game, it's about how enjoyable is the game. There will always be a entity stronger than the others, there will always be coalition and all. Who cares, as long as those entities fight each others, that you can have content and fun with all that ?
---
This take a long time https://eveinfo.com/item/40340/upwell-palatine-keepstar/

Fitting 200mm Rails to a Lachesis so you can cap yourself out doing under 150 DPS seems a bit dumb.

Free advice: Join a reputable new player friendly corp (not one where you're someones pawn)
---
 6 -  What was many now becomes one when one becomes four. 
---
Just a thought to add to this:
---
Op says "What was many now becomes one" could be player factions uniting to fight Drifters, which is possible.
---
But "When one becomes four" could be this trigger? When one race - Humans, occupying New Eden, becomes four - Humans, Drifters, Triglavians, Jove? So literally, when the Triglavians enter into w-space i.e. right now? 
---
The Jove are supposedly all dead, though.
---
The drifters are returning for all the timers. They don't like space structures apparently
---
They got all the faction forts in a peace treaty deal last year.
---
Please show me the citation that even remotely suggests your specific suggestions would improve that player retention issue.
---
Oh, that's right, there is none.
---
Fuck off with your suggestion. You're only suggesting this because you're so fucking scared at the thought of non-consensual pvp and you're latching onto the issue of new player retention as your saving grace.
---
It's pretty fucking pathetic that you'd use an actual issue like the 4% new player retention to push your own fucking spineless agenda.
---
We are borg... Assimilation is inevitable, resistance is pointless, we are the infinite and ourdeaths mean literally nothing... #invasion
---
&gt; Yes because you can't do any other form of isk making
---
You should probably start a web page and fill it with all of the other things I didn't say.
---
&gt; Again, "small entities" basically aren't a thing
---
I have no idea that you're talking about.
---
I just posted about this seperately. 
---
I thought "when one becomes four" 
---
Races with a presence in New Eden w-space:
---
Humans, Jove, Drifters, Triglavians. So literally when there's 4 of these "species" present in New Eden the other thing would happen, and it happened right as the Triglavians went from Abyssal space to W-Space New Eden.
---
It used to have another PDS in the low but they had it changed to an Overdrive Injector to keep up with the Muninns so cap is way more tight.
---
Perhaps they changed the guns on the fit and I just didn't notice? Thanks for pointing this out
---
Tho it was a problem it was never prohibitive in the end and I never lost tackle resulting in a ship getting away (Tho Tywin was close to escaping). It's a bit more difficult to fly but that might just be part of the responsibility of flying a Lach in a Muninn fleet, cap management becomes a learned skill. Nothing a bit of communication in fleet wont resolve. vOv
---
2500 v 2500 max-tidi NPC super fleets.
---
Haha.
---
If the Imperium is forced into cycling around the map in an non-stop war of aggression vs every other entity in the game just so it can balance its mineral reserves, that would be fucking fantastic. 
---
If every time they leave a region, they must pack up or watch it burn down to drifters, at a minimum, that would fucking fantastic. 
---
The MO of nullsec is determined by the environment. If the environment changes, the behaviour must change. Adjusting the power of super capitals might change some wars, but if we want to change the transcendent blue donut, the environment must change.
---
As I suggested elsewhere: 
---
Humans,  Jove, Drifters, Triglavians. So literally when there's 4 of these  "species" present in New Eden the other thing would happen, and it  happened right as the Triglavians went from Abyssal space to W-Space New  Eden.
---
It only affects nullsec and any alliance worth a damn will have a response.

Triglavians invade our space. We fight off Triglavians. Drifters invade our space. Enemy of my enemy is my friend so, naturally, we team up with Triglavians to fight off Drifters and prove our flow. Triglavians realize we need the help when they leave so that Drifters don't invade again so they give us some new BPOs.

If you've read the post I made, I mentioned I didn't necessarily have GOOD ideas. It was more about outlining the problem and getting everyone together to help fix it. However, your responses did do a good job of showing you are a coward, and that the lack of the sheep-kills would really cut into your profit. It's like... you're too stubborn to see that... soon you will run out of sheep. If the majority of the player base feels like you, then EVE deserves to die. I didn't invent that 4% number... just saying....

They need to disallow gates/cyno beacons from being anchored in range of citadels. Bring back ways for smaller groups to harass bigger ones

You speak the true truth. Won't be a whole lot, but for sure will help with content and harassement. Especially against renter groups.

nice F1 clicking, very cool.
---
elitism in provi ttyl
---
Well, look at it this way; you can go back to making more isk in preperation for the NEXT war noone will turn up to.  You know you're in the wrong place for actual pvp, right?
---
Thanks I really did my best hitting F1
---
In before the Drifters come back to reinforce the structure again if it is successfully defended, but each time doubling their fleet numbers. Screen cap this.
---
Well so you have to get 11 more ceptors back home to delve - poor goon. :(
---
Fine aged, single malt salt here.
---
You're allowed to say that, but.... you probably have the ability to farm up a lot more isk now. There's certainly a lot more games out there now, and after dedicating a month to.... something, and then having it be all for nothing... based on a entry level landmine.... how much can you really blame them for going elsewhere? The "hardcore" EVE economy can still stay alive in low-null perhaps? Maybe even make a "cheap" trade hub in low? THAT would be spicy..... of course none of the big blobs would vote for that...  but.... what's the counter to that? newbs n player retention in the shitter?
---
op is from a high sec alliance that tried to move into ncdot renter space, got crushed, and disbanded
---
did anyone ever used officer modules in wormhole space?
---
nice video, looking forword for more, while DC defends their home without goons - soonish...
---
Goons cycling region just mean they will unanchor structure, strip rigs, and while mining the region down burn the next one. Nobody can fight them currently so why would that change except being a PITA for Goons ?
---
Just nerf anoms and moon extraction time (double it at least). Force them to live off 3 or 4 regions alone and split their supers accordingly. This create content. It means a dread bomb has a chance. It means a roam has changes to catch something. It means it's muc riskier for them to drop titans and supers because of a dread bomb counter can work.

Prior to the wardec changes, I'd always viewed high as the most dangerous region of space. After that, I thought of low as the most dangerous. Maybe after this, things will be less fucked up.

is it that hard to deal with drifters ?

how the 35k players alliance cannot deal with two battlefronts at the same time ?

Yeah, use trigs and serve you loot and other usefull stuff on a silver plate so this shit just turns into another retarded farmfest
---
As an entirely amateur ancient near eastern history afficionado, this is genuinely exciting news. Wassukanni, the supposed Mitanni capital, has never been discovered. 
---
The Mitanni were a group of old-Indic Indo-European speakers who conquered and were eventually largely culturally assimilated by their Hurrian speaking subjects. They were contemporaries of the Hittite Empire in Anotolia and New Kingdom Egypt. The similarities between their original language and the Sanskrit of the Hindu Vedas is striking.

Wouldn't it be fun, that like in the starting of eve lore, we had to flee the earth through a WH and landed in New Eden, what if with all that, we have to flee again and while drifters and triglavian conquer New Eden, we all start in Next Eden with 0 SP and all gone...
---
It's a bit small for an empire 'ent it?

I am considering resubbing due to this.

A goon with an unusual high interest in the ancient Mittani empire. Coincidence?

the people we want to attract are people that are Encouraged by the loss. the people you are going for don't see anything of value in eve anyway, regardless of NPE.

That strategy worked out well for PL right?  It's not like the game rewarded that behavior over the last two years or anything.

Eve players are such a bunch of babies. Ccp is trying to get new players so we all stop complaining about no content and everyone cries

Oh god please this

Awh man thanks, my dumb ass. Thanks

Thanks mate o7

Skill points?

I expected Jar Jar and got him.

&gt;i dont get why you take everything back home

We were likely going to anyway.  The drifters being a big unknown (whether this will escalate further, etc) are just another reason in favor of it.

I am not quite sure what math you are talking about. 
---
One Warp Core Stabilizer gives you +1 WarpCore Strength. You always have to overpower the amount of warpcore Strength by at least 1 to invoke your chosen modules effect (Warp Disruptor = prevent warping, Warp Scrambler = prevent Microwarpdrive + Warping). A Warp Disruptor always has +1 point of power, meaning you will point everything without warp core stabilizers with just one single Warp Disruptor, when you have one stabilizer no effect applies, two points of power will overpower a single stabilizer and so on. With Scramblers it works the same way, just that Scramblers can carry different strengths in them. Faction and Officer Scrams have 3 points of power, T1 &amp; T2 Scrams come with 2 points.
---
This is basicly all there is to it. I hope this answered your question.

"ABBREVIATION got reckd in ABBREVIATION by ABBREVIATION with ABBREVIATIONs, rofl cryptic eve meme"
---
We're at the part with the cryptic eve meme.
---
My personal experience is that I quit the game twice after trying it for a week each time.  
---
In 2006 I tried joining a ten man corp with a group of friends who were all new.  They needed stuff, so they fell into the trap of high sec mining.  That didn't last.
---
In 2010 time I tried to play solo.  I was "playing the market" like the high seas pirate trading games.  I got in my iteron, picked up some quantity of one item in high sec, and autopilot it to somewhere it sold higher.  It'd take 30 minutes to go six jumps.  That obviously didn't go well.
---
It wasn't until I joined Brave Newbies in 2013 that I stuck with the game for more than a week.  Been active ever since.
---
Hahahahaha. Your tears are delicious!

About your question, I think as a new player you can do many things before you even get in contact with the drifter invasion if you're specifically going for it. In general eve is a very good game so try it out. Many issues are discussed here and most of them are real but for the beginning those shouldn't be too bad for your enjoyment of the game.
---
What if.... reduce hi sec area, make it more safe, but less profitable. And make low sec more of a necessity to make money? Again.... just rough ideas.... again... I'm just trying to address the issue.... I don't care how we solve it.
---
I'm betting that the only newbies who join null alliances are friends who are told to do so. Rest are stuck in... care-bear land as I was a long time ago. We gotta get those rookie numbers up! :p
---
I'm not sure what you mean by " the people we want to attract are people that are Encouraged by the loss ". If you mean that you want them to farm... then yes... a lot of people do.... If you mean people who stand back up and fight again, then... again, it goes back to..... perhaps you weren't burned by farming scrap  and saving up a month and having it blown up. Maybe 10 years ago, choices were slim in what kind of games people could play. I don't know. But current recruitment methods = 4%
---
Also, while I understand that..... maybe care-bears do not increase your fun level of the game, (especially if they're more protected), they .... DO provide a healthier game overall. More care-bears = more recruitment possibilities and also more $$$ for CCP to keep the game healthy. Possiibly more servers, more admins more changes. Big EVE wars are awesome. I doubt anyone would want to change the game away from the core pvp aspects in low/null, and I would not want to change that either.

New players start in high sec. If you want to make them stay and try out things CCP needs to work on high sec.  
---
Make Lv 1-3 missions fun or at least usefull for ISK making. Maybe work something out that a single account more effective when mining.  
---
Tell a story with the missions let new players learn about lore and the empires.   
---
Try to give someone who is playing EVE something interesting and fun to do while he or she is learning the game.   
---
And most of all do something about the starting/vanilla interface
---
Well Diamond rats are rats that come from FOB's in hisec and the Sityo's in nullsec and are either Blood Raiders or Guristas.   They have an enhanced AI and in hisec they will send mining fleets to the asteroid belts and to Moon belts in the system in which the FOB is based.   If a player with negative standings is there or comes in, the mining ships will warp out and in comes a fleet to deal with their enemy.    They will point you (not scram) and web and so on, they do a lot of DPS so you have to clear their tackle and get out.     Taking down the FOB is actually doable with one or two players but is meant to be a group activity, I used a Leshak and a Nestor with very high resists based on the faction I am attacking.   With the Blood Raiders you have to deal with pretty intense neuting and you should have a MJD to get out if it goes hairy.
---
What I was suggesting is... if you make hi sec significantly less profitable, and decrease it's size, by like... half? maybe? And increase low sec profitability AND have it "eat up" that hi sec space.... then that will create incentive for content...
---
Gotta say... dissapointed in these reactions. Thankfully they seem to be the minority.
---
We're not actually to to drifters. They are definitely neutral on my overview.
---
We just have a mutual defense pact with them regarding horde.
---
Copied this from an earlier reply, I hope this helps.
---
&gt; No space in Eve is safe
---
Back in my day this sentence meant something other than "because anything can be deleted by a GM using NPCs as a medium".
---
I do get why people are cheering for what's happening, but I'm not sure NPCs conjured from thin air to soot random stuff is on the same level of meaningfulness EVE is supposed to or used to be.
---
In all fairness, two-front wars rarely end well.
---
And if you fuck up and lose 1 cerberus - you are having bigger isk lose than feeding whole fleet of talwars worth 2mil each.            
---
Now if you do stuff more badly you just lost most of this cerb fleet.
---
&gt; The cost of maintenance should exponentially increase, by a huge factor. It shouldn't be costing them a couple billion for a whole region, but cost should go into hundreds of billions.
---
&gt; This way, Alliances cannot sustain to hold large regions if they don't have the numbers and efficient money mechanism, if they do, well their wallet gets equally hurt.
---
This would just cause the large alliances to break off into coalitions of several smaller ones that would mutually blue each other and grant full access to structures. The game offers more than enough tools for groups of players to cooperate without being in the same alliance that any mechanism intended to keep alliances small can simply be circumvented.
---
9 more. Haven't been up in the warzone in a week or so, Frat's been giving me the rare and elusive small gang fights I so care. Weird, right?

Unpopular Opinion: EVE should not be safe. You should not play EVE if you want a safe gaming experience.

You may sigh but actually are all noobies  who start to play thinking like this?

I lead a lot of user research teams and These type.of videos are actually great to really understanding the what users really think and how we take that feedback to Improve the products and services we develop.  When you get from 40%to 95% user satisfaction it makes a huge difference

That itself sounds terrifying.
---
"I saw Goons protect their Rorquals with supers sitting in belt, how hard can it be?"
---
I thought you meant "wallah" as in Arabic for swear to God XD
---
Apparently they'll come to you....when they blow up your structures.
---
We're not though, just mainfleet.  sigs and squads are staying deployed.  No point in keeping mainfleet up north anyway since they accomplished what the objective.
---
hehe yea.... true. Although I would also wish for .... a better,  longer, more slower paced, introduction to endgame perhaps? Seems a lot of players kind of get stuck in hi-sec and... that's what frustrates a lot of senior EVE players.
---
Capitals used to be for grinding down player owned stations, sbu, ihub and other sovereignty structures. But now you hack them. Tehe.
---
Learning skills weren't mandatory either and used to teach people to balance long-term and short-term goals. Apparently, that was a good thing.
---
What's your point?
---
Unless goons know something what other people don't know.     
---
Like that you will need whole alliance in like 2 weeks to defend huge wave that is coming.
---
We're...not? We're blue to about 30%. We go shoot goons all the time. Reality is, of the people we ARE blue to, almost none of them are:
---

---
* Giving good small fights
---
So...I don't care and I have friends in Dreddit who come out EVERY night, and the neighbours have stopped getting bitched at by their leadershit and actually fight again.
---
I'm all for resetting Brave, and if we went so far as to break up TEST, then sure we could fight SF and SPVG I guess. I can always send their small gang FCs a challenge and fight them anyway tho.
---
**You** are really fucking poor...
---
The null sec blocs are the result of everyone going to the same place to do the same thing.  If 40,000 people joined a wh corp it would be a null block with extra steps.  
---
WH space is a stupid special snowflake.  You can't have a 1,000 man wormhole corp, because of bad mechanics.  If you tell everyone to 'join a wh corp' when there are literally number cap limits in place for the game mechanics used, they are going to have a bad time.
---
This is just another stupid fucking wh idiot rant.  It is 'we need more targets in wh space' because WH space is fucking shit.  The only people that live there are people who abuse WHs to hunt in nullsec.  Tasty Irony.
---
I hope not, if it is we are all responsible of some seriously disturbing shit.

Thanks CCP.

I'm in favor of bringing this back. But its still NC PL etc fault for not adapting to the changes, like seriously.  They saw what goons were doing and just said no, which was catastrophically dumb on their part.
---
They've come back for the ansi timers.
---
They need to burn EVERYTHING. I fear no drifter. If our krabs have to fend for themselves more they can harden up or die. Maybe I won't have to go on "integration roams" every weekend to go find wayward krabbing newbros and spodbrains and teach them what being in Dreddit's about.

---
So much wrong with this single statement. 
---
You didn’t have to do shit lol. You chose to go back. You could have continued grinding undefended structures and called it PvP. And if you continue to choose to call that PvP, then by your own definition drifters grinding undefended structures is also PvP. 
---
Zzz what a snore.
---
none of the changes you mentioned have anything to do with content generation. no one that actually generates player content lives in high and those that do will stay there or leave the game. you can completely remove highsec from your mind in regards to meaningful content creation that leads to bidirectional player interaction.
---
lol....
---
If someone who wants PVP join a WH corp there wont be a 1k ppl bloc.  
---
So i dont know wtf you are talking about. You should rly change your napkin and go back krabbing.  
---
I'm talking to the ppl that want to PVP. Not Krab and join a PVP fleet to get the FAT.  
---
So just a wall of text full of bullshit. Did your Krab alt get ganked?  
---
Idiot :-)
---
Waiting for them to start doing this with pirate factions so the blood raiders can reclaim what is rightfully theirs from the goon menace
---
Still baffles me that low power structures can be used for anything other than docking up and self destructing your pod. Shouldn't have ref. timers or shield either.
---
Sounds fun. I like to roll around solo in assault frigs and I get some dank frags when I don't get endpoint dumped or :ccp:. Yknow it's kinda funny that's the only way I've died in a solo AF so far.
---
But yes you can still get out there as a solo inty / frigate guy and do some damage and get some fun fights.
---
Totally recommend checking out the buffed assault frigs.
---
A game that's been out for 15 years and the only other way to get progress is by waiting for skills to train. 1m SP is barely enough to effectively fly one ship much less any variety or maxed skills.
---
our boys got 99 problems but structure bashing ain't one
---
NPCs drop them.
---
Too much goonthink, stop krabbing and htfu. Maybe if goons have a civil war over all this krabbing and bashing, TEST will have one too?
---
yes
---
I did wh space, its more sitting around finding nothing but people running snakes, thats not fun, honestly rather play Diablo on my phone. The only fun I had was making fits for the new trig ships as they were releasing, the lack of brain cells is just dumb in wh space. And before someone chimes in, no, you fight more mindless than f1 blobs, the difference is you guys approach and sit there and suck each other with bhaals, where in blocks you cordinate retards to shoot the same target around the same time to prevent enemy logi from keeping the fleet alive.
---
That sounds close to an offer to undock and show the rest of EVE how to wage an effective campaign...
---
Worked ok for NC/PL right?
---
I'm no big in production at all, but I'm pretty sure this meta modules are drop only... You get them from PVE activities rather than building it yourself! 
---

Which wormhole group should he join? You seem to be ashamed of your own alliance/corp flair.
---
Just respond with the Titan drop
---
Nullcord?
---
Not sure if comment about Skill Injectors or Twitch Thots...
---
because it is much easier to bot in a rental alliance.  nobody gives a shit.  Goons give about .5 shits.  which is more, but still not zero.  
---
also, goons are pretty much toxic.  if you just want to pve in peace, the last thing you want is the garbage that you have to listen / pay attention to.
---
Some players here on reddit are very vocal that they didn't had any handholding when they started. While I can understand that I noticed that they are becoming less and people start to rethink a bit.
---
The complexity of the game was much lower when the veterans started to play. The amount of highsec ganking doesnt seem to have existed to that amount a few years back.
---
On the other hand we certainly dont want to take away certain aspects of eve which make eve eve. True loss and the danger of losses (even in highsec) are important to the very nature of the game. Certain things could and should certainly be made easier. The first thing that comes to mind would be a good default overview setting.
---
Btw the reason why many people quit is imho that the activities which you can do in the ea
---
Join small corps/alliances. Not that "big" WH Alliances.  
---
Kill-at-Will give content in smal/medium gangs
---
Nobody could cycle regions like that. An unending structure grind, an unending war on two fronts, a perpetually exposed logistics network. I would be tempted to cancel my current project and go back to being a pirate -- I revel in wake of a perpetually moving blob. 
---
At best, Goons would be forced to use their 2x size to protect 2-4x systems, spreading their umbrella thin. They would still see diminished profits and therefore diminished membership, diminished super capital fleets. 
---
The Imperium could attempt to create cross-map coalitions to address the problem, but that shit would be impossible to maintain.
---
I think recognizing the map plays a huge role in behaviour is spot on by CCP. Profit and danger must always correlate: a map which allows the minimization of risk and the maximization of profit with the same action is bad map design.
---
Got myself T2 small and medium Lazer weapons with those skill points o/
---
Personally, I totally get what CCP was going for with it, and I honestly think the majority of the EVE community took this way too serious :(
---
Meta modules can't be produced, they drop as loot from rats. If you open the info window for an item ingame and go to the industry tab, if there is no blueprint the item can't be manufactured.
---
I'm not yet convinced.  Hopefully, it'll end after a week or two and we won't get to find out.  I'm just super glad I'm no longer involved in running an alliance, so don't have to care anymore.  I can just play the game and not worry about the space job.
---
Pro tip: When mocking a senior, typing it out as a millennial would loses something in the translation.
---
we literally just had the biggest rental alliance (filled with bots) break up.  AND .... it was taken over by another psuedo rental alliance that is filled with bots.  
---
nothing changes.
---
Why can I only upvote once???
---
Removing scamming for one seriously
---
Well, I see where you're coming from. Hi sec currently is a lot of casuals that probably would quit if forced to do PvP.... That's fine. I'm not super upset about that scenario. I'm just looking for ways to engage more of them into at least SOME pvp. 
---
Additionally, that last paragraph above is pretty important imo. Even if there are care-bears you do not interact with, they are still valuable to EVE health. Just because they do not benefit your player experience, they may still be helpful in keeping the game healthy.
---
He just explained to you why wormholes are pretty shit and not the saviour of eve some people think it is.
---
People obviously don't want to play in wormholes too much. There's more people living in wormholes for easy access to nullsec hunting than for anything happening in wh space.
---
It's a pretty barren landscape and that's fine, niches are cool in eve but outside nullsec hunting and easy isk farming not too much happens in wormholes. Part of the problem is that ccp has not iterated on whormholes much and the environment is pretty much solved. WHs were so cool when people were trying to figure shit out but now it's pretty meh.
---
So “Hon Hon Hon” is now “Home Home Home”.
---
"Additional" monetization always starts with small stuff and it gets as far as customers accept it ... or until product die due to it.         
---
Sometimes this monetization get to absurd levels that  ... well look at ubisoft games - you can buy almost every thing for the "gold" in them ...            
---
Guess what - in many of those games instead of buying this gold you can just modify in game memory to inject yourself with desired gold currency ... and then just buy the desired items.          
---
There is no store - just created additional grind that persuades dumb people to send Ubisoft money.    
---
No real store ... nothing, just "GIVE US FUCKING MONEY OR GRIND"
---
I heard you like meta....
---
Did you reread that before you hit thet replay button?!?!
---
Do you actually know what a huge early draw to Eve was for a lot of the old guard; it wasn't mining or ratting, it was shitlords and scams and murder in a dark world where you were going to be set upon by the scourge of the gaming community.  We were the red headed step children of the MMO world and we thrived on being just that.
---
Sounds like you want to be taken to the funfair, jump on some health and safety approved rides, chomp on some nice cotton candy and get carefully driven home by someone that’s gone through a rigorous screening procedure and has great air con so you're nice and comfy.

Na. Just some more crearive picture would have been nice. I actually upvoted the post. I prefer it if people are creative on this reddit even if it's not top notch.

Meta module only dropped by NPC, no BPO available to players exists.

Glad to help, StainGuy

You can build capital meta modules tbh

The real irony of all this, is that Providence had a "special surprise" for us this night. Lovely.
---
Can't spin supers and titans. Pretty shit.
---
it is nice that ccp found a way to save ncpl butts from goons, but at the same time it is a shame that when ncpl had upper hand and they steam rolled groups around new eden ccp did nothing.
---
Its hard to argue with people who have probably never seen the 'Fleet is full' message.
---
I respect your point. True 100% safety would be a BIG change..... but... I'm just not sure how to.... take away suicide ganks by trial accounts. How to distinguish real newbies from going to trade hub vs people with alts being scummy? Or... how to reduce that... because.... given the current state, why SHOULDN'T people just keep making alts to keep the suicide gank chain rolling?
---
Little more than a small bandaid for an issue CCP refuses to fix.
---
The npc response tackle frigs have insane tank and also logi. When I hunted mining fleets it took me tc3+gila, well over 1k total dps, and killing logi first before I could kill tackle/webs and get loose. 
---
A long process, and this was just frig only response fleets 
---
If I saw cruisers or bs hulls on dscan it was GTFO time
---
I laughed
---
Thanks capital mods for breaking the pattern.
---
I thought this was ancient scripture tbh
---
Reads like a caption to some Dorian Cleavenger's work.
---
depends on what the cause is. right now it's pretty clear that the regions with the most players/structures/economy are the ones getting hit. right now we don't know what the exact link is, but I'm pretty sure it's going to be worse for us than 'the little guy'.
---
yeh triglavian meta modules can be manufactured as well, but those are kinda exceptions from the norm
---
**No**
---
Stahp. I can only get so erect
---
If the Drifters only target the large sov holding alliances, it could be a way to try to limit the size for an alliance to hold.
---
No player is going to put the "health of the game" over their own survival or interest. Not a single one. Pretending otherwise is a cope.
---
I like how mittens posts like he actually does PVP.
---
Thank you Gerier, very cool!
---
dude I've been playing this game since 2014 and I still fly mostly frigs
---
In the initial period I used two AF's to play around with the fleets that came in on my miners then an AF and a Zealot, what I did was strip the tackle away then turn and kill them, warping out as needed, I used the AF to burn around to keep them there and it was a fun challenge at least initially.
---
In terms of the FOB the most dangerous fleet to come in on you is the cruiser fleet, I just MJD out and then warp out and then wait for them to de-pawn and go back in hoping for the BS fleet.
---
I believe it was actually "BEEP BEEP I'M A JEEP"
---
Again. I'm past this stage in eve personally. I'm just trying to help with player retention. Maybe back then, there were less games to play. I don't know. I'm over here literally just trying to figure out ideas to.... get more newbies and hi sec people involved in more spicy pvp stuff. I just want there to be a bit more of a smooth transition, because as it stands, you either have a friend to recruit you to null, or you don't know wtf you're doing and get stuck in hi-sec and feed. And I don't know about you, but I'm all out of friends that I can recruit to a 17 year old space game. We need those randos to stick around, and at the very least pay CCP monthly to keep the game healthy. Read some of the other replies I posted here.
---
I recently changed completely what I do in game and have been having more fun playing EVE in the past month than in the previous 3 years.
---
I wanna see those empire super titans in action.
---
Afaik most suicide gankers use characters kn omega accounts. If you multibox let's say five calayst to suicide gank someone those have to either be omega or you're breaking the eula.
---
Suggestions like less dps for alphas are a path to pay to win that nobody wants to go down. It would make alphas terrible and actually be negative advertisment.
---
So while I agree with you where the some of the problems are, I consider your suggestions as bad.
---
Forced pve across all sec will surely end well unless you think the trigs will just sit around twiddling their thumbs.
---
"I like PVP as long as there isn't the dangerous stuff involved"
---
That's literally what makes it fun/challenging/scary. PvP would suck without that stuff.
---
Yeah, doubt you will need much titans or supers to kill them tho.
---
thats true but its tanky af and scram ab is enough vs the MWD ram frigs you will encounter alot in FW space
---
Just like it would be IRL if some alien force invaded. We would have ZERO idea why; just like this.
---
Literally a fucking game about politics.
---
Thank you hullpen, very cool!
---
What is a dormo dog?
---
 I honestly think the northern regions will become drifter nullsec now. Or whichever reasons aren't defended well enough. Would at the very least make the pushing and shoving for the remaining space a bit more intense.
---
Fair enough. Thank you for the heads up. In my defense I did mean only in pvp, but either way, I see now, that my point would be moot. Well, we'll need something different then... I appreciate people brainstorming.
---
I have literally never seen a Relic Interceptor. I even considered it once myself, as an alternative fit for running Ghost Sites, but decided against it for the simple fact that Interceptors dont get a role bonus to virus strength and coherence.
---
Next time you complain please complain about a legitimate problem. We'll still shit on you for it, but at least we won't laugh at you.
---
Either you need lot of supers to kill the drifters and the little groups (that almost do not exist anyway) won't be able to live a whole lot anyway (even if drifters won't strike often the for sure will at some point), or you don't and at worst you will use the supers anyway and won't be at much risk.
---
How many timers are running currently in Delve ?
---
Not denying that this could be seen early, as many people pointed out this risk already before lifeblood went live. But also consider that the players that piled up in PanFam alliances or Lowsec-Groups usually see every static PvE as a punishment and thus would not adapt but rather quit or resort to niche gameplay financed by selling PLEX (either from old money or good RL incomes of grown olds, these guys mostly play EVE for over a decade now). Taking a look at Logins and considering that PLEX price still is in a quite reasonable range for the huge growth in demand after Lifeblood, that is exactly what happened ...
---
They dont want to adapt they want their pve to be nice safe and predictable. Npcs fucking up their structures is not that for them. Who didnt see this coming anyways fob rats can and do shot structures and have for quite a while.
---
If you want to contribute:
---
* Make a corp
---
* Recruit noobs
---
* Be a good leader
---
It's within your power
---
Context?
---
what are you doing now as opposed to before that makes it so fun?
---
Either way, it was fucking awful
---
Maybe you do have this and just didn't use it, but I'm surprised you don't just use alpha alts if all you need to counter these are t1 dessies
---
I think that it is great that they shoot structures.   When I was on holiday one of my structures had its shield tickled multiple times by FOB rats, I hope they do it again when I am actually around, as kaboom and Citadel combat practice here I come
---
If you want 32v32 pvp, go play battlefield, or squad, or whatever.
---
If you want to play a game where you can lose the entire contents of your wormhole in value in a single small nullsec skirmish, play eve.
---
The cynic might argue that the money they got from microtransactions was worth it, and now they are thinking of doing right the balance.
---
You encounter mwd ram frigs in FW space?
---
Sorry to double reply but If you are harassed by anyone from Wingspan withing 72hrs of us getting you in to your new system please contact Nikki Ikala in game, he is one of our personnel directors and will deal with the agent(s) in question.
---
i use them a lot and it's pretty fun to explore with.
---
though for eve, the data gets a bit skewed due to the alts ppl create
---
Not a lot of people know it but the last extension name was a big hint.
---
Do Abyssal space runs, you'll find the only drifters you can solo in a subcap.
---
Sorry guys. I literally asked on Reddit last month for all this to happen. The only difference is, I asked for triglavians to act this way; not drifters
---
Aka, join targets, not us.
---
Jackman, Grant or Hefner?
---
And how cool would that be if they didnt.   Tbh it's about time NPC actually did something in game.  For years they have been pretty useless red crosses in anomalies
---
&gt; 't know much about the type that show up in k-space (Apollo Tyrannos), but the ones that you find in high-class wormhole space (Arythmos Tyrannos) will, even without fancy AI upgrades:
---
&gt;     fly towards you at 6,000m/s
---
&gt;     agress, and apply perfectly, to a frigate at 400km
---
&gt;     deal 1,000 DPS
---
&gt;     neutralize 200GJ/s
---
&gt;     point at 100KM 
---
Seriously? That's just fucking stupid.
---
All of them, but you are really late to the joke (as you can see in the other comments below mine).
---
So glad i quit null for good.
---
EVE already has the ability to buy infinite everything with real money via PLEX -&gt; ISK -&gt; Injectors/Ships/etc. It is the ultimate pay to win game.
---
I'd like to see them pop your supers and raid your wallet
---
Funny of you to assume you've seen everything that exist in EVE
---
Sure give me 50b and ill throw supers on them
---
&gt;resistance is &lt;s&gt;pointless&lt;/s&gt;
---
Guard is actually controlling those drifters as a freelancer
---
Like T3s?
---
For me its really great idea with this invasion. Cause more and more new player and new corporations could not take any parts of the map cause always one and same coalition was sitting there. Now most of them gonna be sad cause they gonna lost this boring and static environment. Finally some smaller alliances gonna get chance to be a part of null or whatever. 
---
This means totally re-balance and finally some bigger changes to map. After years of stagnation in most null areas we gonna finally see some moves, some changes, something new. 
---
Im personally really happy with this invasion and its always great to see bigger changes in game. Good work CCP :D
---
I appreciate your appreciation!
---
That's pretty dismissive. 
---
1. You are putting WAY too much faith in me being a leader.
---
2. It's not like my recruiting singlehandedly is going to bring the 4% up. This is a global issue, not a personal problem I'm having. Are you REALLY that afraid of change that you would simply rather your game die out?
---
Hush, child.
---
I'm getting seriously mixed messages.
---
Are the drifters a challenge that requires redeploying a super fleet?
---
or are they a mild nuisance that just requires t1 destroyers?
---
Seriously, It would hurt, but as I said, I would accept that for the thrill of it all.
---
You wouldn't build them to what they are now.
---
You'd build them into what the new world would require you to be.
---
&gt; Sure, one can argue that newbies can just join a null alliance and get the fast track. But that's not the same. That's not a MMO. That is you being pigeonholed into a specific play style that is not for everyone. 
---
I'm in Dreddit and to say I'm pigenholed into a specific play style is a comment made by someone who has probably has never actually been in a major null bloc. I do solo roams, I do small gang, I do blops, I go on the large structure bashes and defenses (what I can only assume you mean I'm pidgeonholed into doing.) I go check out wormholes, looking for fights. PVE? I can do exploration, ratting, mining if I really wanted to. 
---
TEST doesn't just run itself either. I mentor new players. I process applications to join our corp. I run fleets. I moderate our forums.
---
My biggest problem with EVE right now is I just don't have enough time in the day to do all the awesome stuff I want to do.
---
So, in the vast majority of cases, the targets will still be out and about to be killed.
---
I've heard the nullsec invaders are brand new and much stronger, have fun!
---
Some smaller alliances do. THat's the point.
---
And yes, sampling bias would push them to mostly attack massive alliances.
---
It would still eventually have a small alliance be attacked.
---
As of yet, that hasn't happened, right?
---
So, for all we know, there is something in how the attacks are coded that is making Drifters actually favor larger alliances, as opposed to simply attacking randomly.
---
We'll have to wait and find out.
---
That's not what I said. I do explore and hunt explorers quite frequently though, and I've never seen this. Slippery they may be, but if never seen it happen in the first place at all
---
More than 150. It s because goon+lawn+tnt has a lot of structure there.
---
More than 50 for init, both in Fountain and Querious. 
---
It was numbers form yesterday, dont know about today.
---
it s easy to win a timer alone vs full drifter fleet if you know what you are doing, so it s not a big deal anymore for active people.
---
That little NPC was me.
---
Well, in FACT, the number of people voting went up, the number of young people voting went dramatically upwards, and not to forget the biggest winners of this election were greens and liberals (except Britain and some semi-fascist eastern europe countries but who cares), so parties usually elected by youth voters ... so get out and back into your filter bubble ...
---
Me too. Third time is a charm, eh KarmaFleet?
---
Isk is nothing without fun gameplay.
---
Let me play this tiny violin for the poor Goons having to do something.
---
Apparently he n+1s titans for KS kills in AUTZ  
---
mysides.jpg
---
uh... so far, all comments i've seen were favourable concerning the drifter invasion. i don't see a fiasco there?
---
and are you sure the best option to get rid of pve groups is to throw pve at them?
---
finally: the concept of rental space allows pvp groups to focus on pvp instead of having to krab to get the isk for their toys, while simultaneously allowing the ppl who like krabbing to focus on that with reduced pvp concerns. it's a mutually beneficial arrangement, so i think it'd take some serious changes to balance and/or mechanics to kill this concept
---
bad idea right there. If you want big blobs to go about bashing everything and telling everyone to use their structures or be locked out of competitive industry or any moon mining, this is the way to go.
---
i, for one, welcome our new overlords
---
Repeat step 6.
---
love Enyos, those things are little fuckin murder boats
---
W?
---
This, so badly, so much of this.
---
I WANT TO BUY ALL OF THIS 3D STUFF
---
yes whenever im in something kitey :)
---
Lol salty people were too comfortable sitting pretty in their alliance space. EvE isn't supposed to be easy or comfortable, they found a way to finally shatter that status quo after struggling with sovereignty changes for years.
---
Everyone bitching about this is someone who was sitting in a comfortable niche, usually a PvP one.
---
But that's just it, Eve isn't a PvP game, or a PvE game, or a crafting game, it's a big scary sandbox and you shouldn't feel safe.
---
I say Bravo CCP, found a way to finally shake the game up after a decade of relative stasis
---
so tempted to resub and enjoy this drifter madness
---
i wonder if karmafleet would allow someone to rejoin a third time?
---
i hope everyone had a great friday
---
I am curious, how do you do this?
---
Do you get the model through that software that read eve stuff and throw it in the printer?
---
How is it?
---
"Guys, we have built this sandbox for you to do whatever you want, however you want to do it."
---
16 years and 700 million dollars later:
---
"Not like that."
---
hahahaha
---
I honestly disagree. Nullsec has been stagnating for many years, thanks to players figuring out the optimal path and avoiding risks as well as blobbing together with the end result of having space that is safer than highsec.
---
Placing risk back into nullsec and making the vast gains that can be had come at a cost is important. Going with AI / NPC's that are less predictable instead of yet another rework that will be reverse engineered in two weeks is not a bad move.
---
Anti Freeze would just make it worse, it also contains an alcohol and the bad for humans type non the less
---
It should come from everywhere. I like how people like the whole  "Hur dur, Eve should be dangerous" line right up until they're not the threat
---
That's his point! They're so slippery you haven't even seen them!!! That's how good they are!!!
---
Thought horde was there own entity. And all those keepstars were Panfam .  Transferring them along with the sotyios does not change who they belong to
---
Drifter NPC's have started reinforcing nullsec structures, destroyed at least 1 jump gate (TEST) and started killing and podding ratters (there have been a few carrier, supercarrier, rattles killed by them). No one knows what the hell is going on, they appear randomly and because they have DD's on their battleships they point and nuke you fast
---
You fool, the rust only makes them stronger.
---
they dont go to moon belts (or at least didnt when highsec moon mining started and i was still mining)
---
*CCP, what is best in life?*
---
*To gouge your playerbase, see them driven to lame pve, and to hear the lamentation of the Goon!*
---
i want to grow up and be a drifter  (◕‿◕✿)
---
Is that Mittani tweet real? If so, that’s peak quality high profile salt!
---
No, but I'm not going to complain about this because it is one of the most interesting things I've seen in Eve for a while and I see no reason why it shouldn't happen.
---
Considering current mechanics and coalition sizes, there is a LOT stopping players from even being able to be there to shoot them.
---
Goddamn you’re right... expect some Muninn nerfs in upcoming patches. You have just ensured Amarr supremacy good sir.
---
Your role is not to deal damage in a Lachesis, you're there to point stuff. A single shitty gun in enough if you care about getting on as many killmails as possible.
---
Like half of them are actually valid points, but trolling CCP fanboys know better I guess.
---
This event indeed offsets PvP activities towards PvE. CCP is desperate and replaces what players who already quit (because of their stupid sov mechanics), should have been doing.
---
I think they do, though I have not actually seen that myself, just know people who lost ships.   This could have happened due to prior warping and contact, so hard to say the exact mechanics in terms of moon belts.
---
Attack sniper BC. A fleet of Nagas could do it with sensible use of MWD and nanite paste. 224km optimal and targetting range, 1,636m/s with 2,311 overheated. Stay out of point and weapons range while still hitting them. It would require a good FC and a support frigate creating bounce points but it could be done.
---
no clue what you're rambling about, but MEGA was about German elections, nothing to do with britain or eastern europe countries.
---
&gt;youth voters
---
true, but as i already said: the "MEGA-Train" didn't manage to win over youth voters.
---
Well that's the difference between a functional and technical definition. *Technically*, as OP specified, wormholes are star systems that physically exist in a different location (galaxy, dimension) than k-space system. They are outside New Eden. *Functionally*, you can define them as systems only accessible via wormholes. Same for k-space. Technically, there are lots of systems players can't visit, simply because no star gates lead to them, but functionally we can disregard those and just talk about k-space systems as anywhere accessible via jump gate. 
---
Thera fits into one category technically, and the other functionally, which is why OP specified.
---
Risk should be provided by other players, not by some AI scripts.
---
CCP, please make it so that the Drifters hack new Eden's banking system and steal all of the OPs liquid isk. Then make sure the OPs supers and Titan are popped, and drifter agents empty his holds. 
---
He may quit when you do this, but a lot will re-sub, and many more will finally give EVE a try.
---
They cant covops cloak, so they should be showing on D-scan (naturally, they may fit Improved Cloak while scanning).
---
But ignoring that, sometimes I'll camp cloaked in a system pre-scan all signatures and wait until prey comes along. An interceptor coming by could certainly get away unless they were bad and distracted, but they've never shown up on grid. 
---
Now yes, certainly, it's possible that it happens more than I think and I just haven't seen it. But considering I hunt explorers on a relatively frequent basis, I think I would've seen this at least once or twice, but nope
---
nope, that would lead to ppl flocking together to get a better chance of defending against this threat. to make ppl spread out more, you need to make resources scarcer so they can't stay all in the same region to krab
---
I’m quoted in the OP but this is an underrated comment :p
---
I already mentioned the overview. A better userinterface in general is alwqys good and CCP did and does some work there. The general menu on the left bar was improved. The you're at war warning icon. The agency is part of that work but in my opinion not a good user interface. 
---
Better starting skills and free skill points are actually not the worst idea imho. CCP has slowly increased the starting skills over the years and removed learning skills for example. Just imagine a new player putting together his training plan. He reads that he should train PG and CPU pretty much asap. So he puts them into the queue sees that skill takes about a week (if he's alpha) and thinks I'll come back next week and play something else in the meantime. Well, most will never come back. If that narrative is indeed common should be visible in CCP's data.
---
So imho remove some skills like PG and CPU and some others of the magic 14. Give each new player 500k unallocated SP. (First newly created char on a new account automatically gets them on creation) Player who got invited by a friend get 250k on top of that.
---
If we brainstorm I could go on for days and honestely most veterans could. 
---
FCC
---
That's not esi mate, that's reading a database on storage, looking for specific things.
---
They’ve killed two full power ansiblexes, , so they do come back for timers
---
I agree there is plenty of stuff to do when you're "out there".  I am not sure what the criteria for being accepted into a corp in null is, but presumably its not "can fly a BC".  I actually appd to Dreddit a long time ago, waited like... six n half days and never heard anything. (I was a bit new to reddit, but was excited to join a more active team at the time). I am assuming no one talked to me because fear of spies and im bilingual? Iono. I had like.. 30m SP at the time? Maybe I applied to like.... THE dreddit as opposed to a smaller TEST corp. I don't know the politics.  
---
Sounds like you personally help a lot, and your fam have a great time over there. However, I'm trying to take the point of view of newer player retention. New players will not know Dreddits and Goons and NCs. Making a choice not knowing what the alliances stand for plus making a plunge to null with people you don't know, with already knowing there's scamming and scummery everywhere? Could be tough. I don't mean to speak badly of.... endgame null/wh pvp etc. It's great. I wish I was more in there. I just want to reduce the gap between that and... people getting lost/griefed in hi sec because I feel like that's what makes them quit.
---
This really is the main point. I want to have fun and be challenged. In the end the ISK doesn't actually exist anyways. No one is going to list my EVE assets on my tombstone. So let's have some fun again. Make EVE mysterious and dangerous. The best of us players will stay to face new and awesome challenges (and fun).
---
Yes. Do it. 
---
You fools. You think the rust is your ally?
---
You merely adopted the rust. We were born into it. Shaped by it. I didn't see fresh steel until I was a grown man. 
---
**The rust only makes us stronger.**
---
Good response  from CCP. If it's aimed at new players , it shouldn't be available for older characters, otherwise it is truly an SP for Cash item, and not a new player incentive
---
Why would you expore and put an effort into doing all the scanning and hacking, when you can sit in basically the same ship, differently fit, and catch people doing all the work / taking their loot?
---
Don't be shy, you can say 1000 hours in MS Paint.
---
It will surely keep carebears around, who do not have the balls to face other players, but feel complete when they shoot some mindless NPC red crosses.
---
The rest will gradually quit.
---
You didn’t include a variable rank for being able to actually complete sites. Interceptor would be dead last on that one for no bonuses. This thread is bad and you should feel bad.
---
Can I at least keep my SP?
---
Good. There are too fucking many.
---
And it's not like they actually *lost* anything from it. Null donuts are why it's literally impossible to balance the game with prices, because money is literally no object to krab blocks. 
---
If their structure dies, asset safety and already replaced. If their ship dies, SRP and already replaced. If their pod dies, med clone to the same system and already replaced. 
---
Send in the Sleepers, Triglavians, Sansha, and CONCORD while we're at it. Burn nullsec to the ground. 
---
#MAKE EVE DANGEROUS AGAIN
---
How about those of us who subscribed to a PvP **multilplayer** game?
---
If you have an Avatar you have to find a way to make that thing asplode, man. A ship in harbour is safe, but that is not what ships are for.
---
Definitely use the big shiny ‘make that ship go away’ button though.
---
I'm well aware. I kept many of those ships from warping had they tried (Especially Tywin, who I presume wanted to bail but couldnt). I did my role and (after checking) my fit is correct and is meant to have those guns. It's a trade off with losing the PDS to keep up with the Muninns. Before the fit changed it was a real issue to do so, so I lost cap for needed speed. 
---
Again, it never stopped me from performing my role but meant i had to do some cap management. Doesnt mean I was perfect. I was needless pointing Lokis that ate cap. For the 2nd set of fights I was better at targeting specific ships like those Vultures, which are a more valuable target to keep the enemy fleet from bailing (in theory).
---
how is this a good post?
---
let me guess; you don't actually play EVE?
---
Welp if CCP pusses out now they're probably going down the drain so GO DRIFTERS GO
---
Can we get screenshots?
---
&gt;who do not have the balls to face other players
---
Implying most of nullsec isn't currently based around blobbing up and ensuring they don't have to fight anyone.
---
Sorry, but large parts of nullsec are safer than highsec in pretty much every way. People can make silly isk with no risk or much effort. Complaining about highsec as a nullsec player is kind of silly then.
---
With decent exploration skill and T2 relic analyzer you'll still have 30 virus stength without bonuses wich is enough to hack ruins if you're not a dumbass
---
Mittens explained where he got the name in a recent fireside. If your alliance spies are any good they’ll have a copy you can listen to. 
---
Also eat his ass.
---
&gt;when you can drop infinite supers but can't get a dozen catalysts 
---
Lol mittens what a fuckin bitch
---
Can I buy it a second time with the steam code ?
---
Do it. Help us burn null to the ground.
---
Both. Unanchor them on regular basis so you dont pile up too many assets of inactives. Further, consider to move up in wh class when you learned a bit about WH life.
---
Why didn't the mittani tell them the truth why all this happens? He must know it because...HE IS THE FUCKING MITTANI !
---
I really mean citadels.  But yeah cool
---
Lol. No.
---
which is exactly what I did the first time, and not something I want to have to repeat because it took 5 + years of subscription time the first time around.
---
That's also true. I've lived in donutty nullsec long enough to hate it now. This forced PvE crap though won't make it more appealing to me
---
yes please its so littered with crap.
---
If the person doing all the work is in an interceptor, you'll have a bad time trying to catch him
---
&gt; Due to the need to perform essential maintenance on the Tranquility cluster involving the removal of sov structures in nullsec, daily downtime will be extended by fifteen minutes on Monday, July 1st.
---
&gt; Downtime will begin at the usual time of 11:00 UTC, and last for a total of 30 minutes.
---
&gt; We expect the cluster to be back online and accepting connections at 11:30 UTC.
---
&gt; Apologies in advance for any inconvenience this downtime extension may cause!
---
Honestly that might be cool. Maybe not in null though. A place where powers greater than the players clash, and player factions eke out an existence between them and attempt to exploit it.
---
And the drifters are actually charismatic. 
---
Just look at that smile.
---
*expansion.
---
But yes. Probably just not the invasion (trig) they were expecting
---
#:nut:
---
I hope drifters kill you (in game)
---
Woah little pusher bee, aren't you supposed to be moving all your shit back home to defend it from the only thing left in the game that wants to fight you?
---
It may have taken a couple of extra minutes to pose my alt in the dress up dolly thingy. I briefly considered doing a mock-up of a boxing poster, but then I remembered that I'm shit at Photoshop.
---
I'm late to this, sadly  
---
But if you're still looking check out Winnie Blues and VB Crew, we aim to help the newbros in AUTZ! 
---
To assist new &amp; returning players is part of the core reason  the corp formed with most of the members joining as &lt;1week old accounts or returning from a 1+ year break from eve.  
---
They're in nullsec and have a good mix of industrialists and pvp focused dudes, I highly recommend them!
---
A dozen catalysts and kill them before they kill all of you. 
---
You *will* suffer losses. I know that's a hard concept for nullsec to understand.
---
Just hope Capcom doesn't see this! ;D
---
Come to wormhole space we will actually love you. 
---
I don't care if you can't fly dick except a rifter, here's two hundred of them let's go kill things.
---
They should just rent.
---
I want to see the drifters start bringing in capital ships.
---
Escalations of fights, maybe we have to find their wormhole and then take the fight to them
---
NPCs should start rorq mining and ratting and get their own renter alliances going.
---
Is there a best damage type to attack with and stack vs drifters?
---
&gt;you have to listen / pay attention to.
---
I have been in multiple alliances in my 13 years playing eve, including goons; given this, I want to assure you the garbage you have to listen, and pay attention, to is pretty much the same as in other alliances. What is more, at least in goons, when someone goes off on a racist or sexist rant on coms, or in alliance chat, there is at least a chance someone does something about it, which is a lot more than I can say for some other alliances I have been in.
---
The final GM.
---
&gt;No one is going to list my EVE assets on my tombstone. 
---
You say that now...
---
CSGO doesn’t have a subscription. What have you been paying for all this time?
---
Sleeper and abyssal PVE &gt; super blobs and kspace structure grinds literally any day
---
I have no idea what makes you think that.  The rewards would be less and probably not worth the investment of time.  What you call a "target" is a player who doesn't want you to shoot him.
---
If you blued everyone around you, you played yourself.
---
Otherwise, help the drifters and start some fires
---
i used to afk mine on moon rocks for hours in my orca with FOB in system and nothing ever happened but thats like a year ago now so maybe that changed but they definetly dont go to the belts on their own 
---
but yeah prior contact might cause that or unlucky timing with rats wanting to bash the station while someone is out mining the belt
---
Let's do it. 
---
We're actually willing to fight them.
---
Use projectile turrets if you want to whore.
---
The fuck are you on about we *love* getting into fights with these guys, they're great.
---
Implying mittens is an F1 monkey might be my favorite part of your post.
---
Not in the fit tho
---
Think for yourself then.
---
Removal of sov structures?
---
Lol, Mint Chip or something, the one with the nudes?
---
Sploosh
---
MEGA was before the elections to the European Paliament, aimed against all the Anti-EU criticism coming from right-wingers. It was just coincidentally that there were also some smaller local elections in Germany on the same day. Get your facts straight. And as a collateral effect of youth voters increasingly taking part in the EU elections they also voted in their local german elections, what increased the numbers of youth voters there also. That in fact led to the success of Green parties all over Europe, with some regions electing far more right because most young people left this region for, well you could say, "greener" pastures ...
---
New player, still playing through the tutorial, but I ran out of railgun Ammo. How do I purchase more? Looking through the market, I was not able to find anything.
---
shhhh
---
also a lot of us won eve, me included
---
Then I'd be ignoring the doctrine fit and two bonuses on the ship. Maybe try not being a scrub and manage your cap
---
I'll take 'what is a jump clone' for 500 thanks
---
2-3 years ago I got kicked down mercilessly by 90% of eve redditors for even ASKING "Why would this be such a bad idea?" (!) - now it seems like the majority want this to happen. As always in every game. Got used to it.
---
Well whoever designed the doctrine is dumb and you should ignore them and think for yourself
---
ETF? Do you fight that dam don't have the skills or the ship new bro experience is lame
---
No matter how much CCP shut up and p2w-ize Eve, CS is in a different league entirely.
---
The Pirate Update came, it was missed, and now it is finally here for real.
---
Bout damn time guys, you were in Guild about this half a decade ago, you whiffed and the industry made fun of you.
---
The rock/paper/scissors to exploceptors is bombers. When they hack a can, decloak, immediately lock and scram. You can close this thread now.
---
Up we go. Recruitment is still ongoing
---
Were doing something for weeks now while the rest of you cried on Reddit about supers and Titans.
---
I hope ccp keeps their balls tight and keep up this event. Shake up new eden. Null low and Highsec
---
I completely agree. In fact, I think it would force way, way more PVP if the game was completely shaken up. Especially if all of null was basically uninhabitable for some time. That concentration of players in high and low would surely create a lot of PVP.
---
Nope. I've been around the SA forums for a very long time, played many games with goons and been in charge of goon corps in other games and it's always been great fun.
---
I never said "eviction." You said the number of structures would stay the same, and I'm telling you that is incorrect, since they're targeting and destroying them.
---
I sub my accounts, so that my ingame made isk can be used for "whatever". I wanted to fly capitals, so I looked at what others were doing, and ratted and ran escalations in subcaps until i could fly a carrier. From there (and in between stratops and sig deployments) I ground my way into a super. From there I ground up fax alts, and rorq alts. From there I put myself into a titan, and built it myself.
---
 I don't disagree that no one particularly enjoys the grind of eve. Many games have similar grinds, but the grind is a means to an end in Eve, as well as other titles.
---
The grind is where people begin to split. Some people are willing to put in the work, and reap the rewards of that work. Others want to bitch and moan on reddit instead. 
---
What I'm seeing now on reddit, is those that didn't do shit for the last 2 years suddenly want CCP to make changes, so they can "catch up" to the people that understood how the game had changed, and then put in solid work. They did nothing, so they want the work that others did to mean nothing as well. 
---
The one thing that absolutely made the grind acceptable in my case was the people in KarmaFleet. I have been playing online games since they were text based, and never had as much fun with a group of people as i have in KF. We help each other, we laugh with each other, we suffer together when things go to shit, we defend our space together, and yes, we keep each other sane when grinding through this game. 
---
If Eve changes, we will change with it. We will put in the work,  and we will be having this same discussion again 6 months after said changes. 
---
See you then.
---
Goonswarm doesn't need more of anyone. 40k is big enough.
---
Wormholes are fun. But yeah jokes aside null needed this. Mayne the drifters will also start nuking botters left and right? To my knowledge the normal rats botters kill don't scram.
---
I wonder if they would be as good without the numbers they have. Would of they be as good as test or brave with their numbers? Better? Worse?
---
Do they punch above their weight?
---
They used to. Now I'm not sure.

Oh, so the posterboy of the MEGA-movement Martin Schulz, which was running for German Chancellor at the time, was just a coincidence.
---
And if they voted green, then the MEGA-train didn't work, cause Martin Schulz is SPD, not Greens.
---
This article brought be back to the sub to check things out.
---
Is this linked to the plot content about the "tri-whoever" that I've been seeing ads for? Whats going with the entire drifter/wormhole storyline?
---
Good point, f1 monkeys and one supreme cuntbag
---
Woah woah. Please stay outta lowsec
---
That solves a problem that doesn't exist then fuckwit. Worst comes to worst i'll just not shoot anything
---
I agree that goons aren't any worse than a lot of the garbage out there.  They might even be better.  Just saying that if you are in a rental alliance, the number of racist / sexist rants you have to listen to drops to zero (well at least close to zero).  Which is less than the imperium, legacy, NCdot, etc.
---
this is the result of severe brain damage after getting beaten over and over by tapi commissars everyday. I shudder to think of the daily miserable lives of tapi pets. We need to put them out of their misery. ( in game )
---
For a battleship-sized afterburner on a cruiser? Absolutely.
---
as I said above; don't you think this kind of shakeup would actually create more PVP? More opportunities to fight/kill other players in new contexts? If all of null was uninhabitable for a time, it would create a pretty dense population in High and Low, idk, just a thought.
---
look for Antimatter Charge S for small guns.
---
https://www.thonky.com/eve-online-guide/eve-item-database?typeID=222

More like they tossed in some scorpions.

Do the drifters actually blow up the structures or do they just reinforce?

both

the biggest salt-generator in Eve, the guy who uses pissing people off as a war strategy, the guy who lets his minions run wild because "lol fuck you" and tells you to HTFU when you whine, is now crying like a little bitch.

I think the strategy for the big blocks is to focus on defending smaller areas. Pull in your forces and create a defensive line.

All i see on Reddit is people complaining begging for me content., Now you get new content and what do people do? Continue to complain and cry.
---
&gt; I actually appd to Dreddit a long time ago, waited like... six n half days and never heard anything. (I was a bit new to reddit, but was excited to join a more active team at the time). I am assuming no one talked to me because fear of spies and im bilingual? Iono. I had like.. 30m SP at the time? Maybe I was too scrubby and applied to like.... THE dreddit as opposed to a smaller TEST corp. I don't know the politics.
---
​I'm not going to reveal anything but I just looked you up. I was not in Dreddit at the time you applied so I don't know what the quality of the HR team was like at the time. If you wanted to reapply, I will gladly look at your application. We run a tight ship and it would be an anomaly for an app to sit in our queue fo
---
&gt; New players will not know Dreddits and Goons and NCs.
---
I don't think this is entirely true. EVE stuff has been on major gaming news sites for years now. It's probably pretty rare to encounter someone who is coming to play EVE and is not even slightly aware that Goons, etc exist.
---
&gt; I just want to reduce the gap between that and... people getting lost/griefed in hi sec because I feel like that's what makes them quit.
---
Look, what you're saying isn't 100% true. I'm sure a jita scam or a CODE. mining gank or something like that has caused players to quit. But are those the kind of people who are going to take their experience and learn from it and try to get better? A long time ago when I was a high-sec miner, I got ganked. It didn't make me ragequit, it made me try to figure out went wrong.
---
They don't need capital ships. They can fit DD's onto Battleships.
---
Are you really complaining at been blob ?
---
Coming from a Panfam member , it is a fucking huge irony right here.
---
 Did you think Hilmar just woke up one day and decided to tell everyone to start spawning drifter battleships that attack structures, with no warning given to anyone?

Of course they planned it. If it wasn’t planned we’d have super buggy drifters, for one thinh

It is not cool when CCP decides who should bite the dust and who shouldn't. I'd behappy to to see TAPIriym blow up, don't get me wrong, but it has to be done by human players, not something CCP programed and control.
---
Most nullbears won't retreat anywhere. They will win Eve. Some will maybe seek safe heaven in highsec.
---
Those who hunt them, like me will stop playing, because there is nothing left to hunt in null and lowsex.
---
There isn't an easy fix to the blue donuts in null, but this method of hastily covering the cracks over shitadels and Fozziesov cancer instead of fixing the mechanics CCP created in the first place.

Shit now I miss derty dan

Congratulations and RIP (:(

I don't think anyone could ever ask for a better result from their low-effort shitpost.

Well done, mate. Bask in the afterglow of that one.

Awesome, thank you! Will look for this.

100% of non-Goons were doing nothing but that? Okay. Good to know you're on top of this shit.

Members of the New Order Outreach Program in CODE are some of the best PvP pilots in this game.

Are the drifters also attacking the old POS towers?

Everyone makes mistakes like that at least once. Whether it blows up in your face is a matter of chance

I wish multiple accounts weren’t possible. 1 player 1 ship.
---
Well it is not that lowsec didn't do shit for 2 years, we just did other shit. It is just no point trying to keep up with groups 10-times or more bigger than you in an economic meta heavily favouring exponential growth. So if we were lets say 400 chars in 2017 that were ABLE to conquer and defend a number of high moons the alternative to stay par with you would have been this:
---
Create a 100 times more rorqual Alts than the average imperium player or leave our old approach of small, mobile tight knit groups with tight RL realations actually knowing each other for an anonymous lemming horde of multiple thousands..

God bless your shitposting power, Wormbro wasn’t a mistake after all

It has picture
---
That was the good days. I dont play EvE. But this event reminded me of some old UO or StarWars Galaxies shit.
---
Oh man, For The King for 10 bucks is an absolute steal. Very fun game with friends, especially. Play on Easy til you figure it out. definitely good for at least 30 hours of game play (even if you do each game mode only once) for 10 dollaroos.
---
Yeah, everyone else does.
---
Naw, the bottom up moon income system was one of the best changes to the game.
---
It meant actual newbies could actually make insane isk in just a t1 venture and you didnt have alliance leadership getting fat wallets while everyone else got the bare minimum.
---
&gt; CCP lives in a remote island that looks a lot like their Jovian space in Eve. CCP goes to the four corners of the world, Drifters attack all around Null sec. 
---
It's not like they went to Africa, South America, or any other developing country mate, so not really a direct comparison.
---
"Used to"
---
Well now I want a QR code of my Zkill on my tombstone.
---
Ive been in 4 alliances and never won a single war. This change will fuck me over even more. But without a doubt it would be good for the game, so ccpls make it happen!
---
To be fair, it isn't like the players were taking up the mantle of being meaningful content drivers. The game stagnated because players let it stagnate. [Here is a perfect example](https://youtu.be/YN_LPXHj26E?t=1h52m30s) of what I mean. Eve is dying because we let it.
---
Sure, CCP could change some mechanics to promote conflict. Maybe diversify resources across null. But ultimately it is the players that drive the content and if we are too busy getting fat off spod, someone or something has to step up and rattle the cage.
---
And based on the flair in order to sit on a wormhole for hours at a time waiting for a chance to whore on a PVE ship. Well done.
---
These are such good screenshots. Thanks for your dedication to take these closeups, and your good eye in catching them
---
I would think any increase in size will always create a regression to the mean. And the degree to which a group engages in combat will determine how practiced that group gets at combat.
---
Anyone who is complaining about how Eve is hard, scary, etc again can eat my fat fucking ass. This game is what it is, because it was scary once. You could not warp to 0. You could not just harvest isk and be able to warp to citadel and tether up. You had to be sneaky and you liked it. Moving across the new Eden in 15 minutes was nice too. Just remove jump fatigue, and watch the old bitter vets flock to the yard. Watch as blue whales come back and feed Eve's economy, and the bottom line for CCPAbyss. Bring back the AT in full force with support from eve nt peeps, and the $$$$ will come rolling in. Would be pretty amazing to watch it happen.

You're not wrong, but you do realize I hope that the vast majority of the *grr renters* rhetoric in this game came from your flair?
---
They've been working on the Drifters and the Trigs for five years incremently, everything you need to know is in the 2019 Eve Keynote. No tinfoil wrap required.
---
&gt;It'll all comes down to CCP handling the event well enough that people will have fun flowing with it.

You do realize that you are talking about CCP here, do you?

I see you've not been introduced to the rocket manticore.
---
Ummm... Real noob here... Judt started playing this week. Can someone throw me a link to what everyone is up in arms about?
---
They're already been through a final time so it's assumed that even keeps will fall if not defended.
---
How many players who live in these countries would attend to an event organized by CCP?
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
That is the view of someone from an anonymous nullsec Megablob with greedy leadership, not seldom making their RL living of EVE.
---
We did not have this problem, Corp bought and zero-interest-loaned Supers and titans for corpmembers, paid 100% Capital/BlackOp SRP. After Lifeblood, with nobody able nor willing to mine for hours a week (when playing just a few hours a week), we had no income anymore. The Moon System provided some kind of balance between nomadic small PvP groups and member heavy PvE centered Nullsec groups like you without favouring anyone too hard. I mean there always were more HiMoons in Null than in low, the problem of MegaCoalitions with Leaderships leeching of their members is a problem caused by yourself.
---
**GAME** 
---
...
---
**OVER!!!**
---
This is the most exciting shit to happen in any MMO for a decade.
---
Careful stream in russian!
---
These things DD supers in 2 shots. They bug out and become uncatchable as they warp between buildings and they shoot literally everything. Even customs offices which have no defense. We have found a way to kill them with structures but they will destroy they player base if none of us can log in and do what we like to do
---
Lets make idiots great again.
---
God damnit! I should have actually read more of the thread. Well, I feel foolish now.
---
I get your point, that goons need to be more fighting oriented, but that's quite literally impossible at their present size.  No matter how PvP oriented you make that 40k people, there's no one that can fight that.  Their very size chokes out all their PvP opportunities outside the odd structure bash deployment.
---
Honestly just going to reply to this one instead. Not saying that in this case the guns was a big deal at all. It's just that they do suck cap, which in many cases could be handy to have.
---
As for using another type of weapon on a Lachesis wouldn't break the 'rules' of the doctrine. If you were in a Muninn with different guns then we can all agree. Not a big deal really.
---
But from running a similar fit (in general that is) on my own Lachesis I am well aware of having to manage cap. Mainly because I run a different point that is way more cap hungry. You using several guns draining cap just reminded me of that, which was all.
---
I'll give you that for sure
---
It should be, but it isn't.
---
Yes their BS DD will blow up a Thanatos
---
I completely agree with you.
---
just using local-scan
---
Well that sucks, good luck in Albion, and please do contract any remaining Eve assets to Rancid Meatballs &lt;3
---
Thats just fucking creepy
---
no tinfoil in the friendship thread. maybe drifters will construct some new stargates to stain  (◕‿◕✿)
---
Its not really about safety, its about this game being a supposed PVP sandbox.  It says something about the sad state of the game when the biggest threat to empires is some crappy overpowered rats.
---
But it’s not just “do something.” We can’t fight these as they have DDs, 2 shield layers, point people from 100 km away and kill things from 200 km away. They can DD supers in 2 shots and move faster than most doctrines. They never tire and hit everything that moves. This is just dumb
---
I’m out of the loop
---
Yeah her. She has nudes? Of course that attention whore would.
---
&gt; People can make silly isk with no risk or much effort.
---
Then why didn't CCP actively address the fact that players can't create danger instead of throwing NPCs at people?
---
Why siphon? Just play. Mine is from 2009
---
Cheers man does make me happy to hear that :)
---
Oh thanks!
---
It'll be interesting to see if anyone actually does this. Obviously, we won't. That would be stupid. However, maybe others will have the gumption to do it? We'll see who puts their money where their mouth is, so to speak. Truly, there has never been a better time!
---
Not if you hunt said capitals, thats actually pretty engaging, but that wasnt my point.
---
The point is, that you choose when to go out and play, you can leave at any time. It is way less time consuming.
---
There are other benefits too like no structure bashing, no blues, no sov bullshit...
---
You feel foolish? It's been almost 24hs and I'm still getting shit for that extra letter xD
---
Credits to Olmeca for the screenshots.

Too long; didnt read; just breeeeee

You mean talking shit about the only thing fighting back was the shit talking on Reddit? Please son. There were a ton of fights to be had and even our small roams had everyone docking up

I thought you were speaking of the youth targeted campaign of Boemermann before EU elections, my bad then. Yeah Schulz was ajoke ...
---
Dude was always a whiner.
---
TL;DR
---
lol wat?
---
yeah just saw an article on this, what an amazing event to happen. I may actually give EVE a try
---
The irony in his tweet history is far more powerfull.
---
Just did a read of his tweet history, he rails against the elites descended from slave owners in the south of the US (he is from Alabama) as that is the system he grew up in (totally agree with him btw, though i grew up in another part of the world and similar system is in place), but he fails to see how his anti-establishment goons who fought against the 'elites' like BoB, NC and PL have now become the new establishment, leading to a stagnation of EVE, with a CSM dominated by him and his allies.
---
Memetani even took a jab at r/eve, how can you not want to read this treasure of a salt mine!
---
This is the first thing to make me consider resubbing to EVE in a long time.
---
Think longer term.. CCP burns 0.0 down, sure people lose a ton of stuff BUT think of the absolute chaos and content created when people start to rebuild. All the defenses are down. All the claims of sov are up in the air. 
---
Blues almost are pointless because they are blue for strategic/strength purposes but now that strength could be wiped out. This will test the resolve and abilities of all sovholders because it will expose those who are weak and only relied on their existing setup and allies for defense. 
---
Absolute Evil Genius whoever thought this up at CCP. Nothing like this could have ever happened with simply pvp content. No one is spared and Drifters don't give a crap. Nothing can be meta'd from them either. You cannot plan much for this. 
---
I hope all the alliances with space domination goals in mind are prepping their gear to invade other alliances after the Drifters are done because its like christmas.
---
Yes! I'm in a similar spot as you are. This is great!
---
Not as mysterious as he'd like to think. Just another Zuckerberg wannabe who devolves into profane ninth-grade run-on sentences when he's emotionally nudged.  Plenty like him out there, except for the trust fund.
---
Here's hoping that this is the plan!
---
Ok, but fix the root causes that led to the current rot first
---
Whats wrong with anal? Hating anal sound so ... butt hurt
---
Yeah really salty you can't farm more PvE content lol.
---
Bad bait post is bad
---
You literally just stated that if it wasn't safe to undock supers, people would undock in other things.
---
So, you clearly agree that there would still be targets.
---
Yes obviously thats the logical reason; I'm drawing an allegory to world safety vs. the 'danger' of nullsec.
---
Maybe it’s the 1-2 punch: draw them all back home and then wham-bam the resource density drops off of a cliff.
---
My brain hurts after reading this....
---
This would be so cool too. When I was really into FW, I always wondered why there wasn't roaming NPC's in Minnie space, and just lonely ships spinning beacons. One can hope!

&gt;destroyed at least 1 jump gate (TEST)

Actually it was a PH jump gate.  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77498342/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77498342/)

Also, the Drifters that have appeared so far are not the ones that have DD's.
---
Should travel interceptors use the Cloak+MWD trick to get through a gatecamp, or is it better to use your fast Align+Warp?  Which method makes you the most difficult to target for instalockers?
---
I'm guessing the answer is quite situational.  If so, assume this is the scenario:
---
\* You're in null-sec in a nullified interceptor with &lt; 2 second align time
---
\* On the other side of the jump gate is an experienced camp with instalock, scramblers, smartbombers
---
\* Assume there is nothing within 2000m of your ship when you jump into their camp

Not even 8 am and you're already rustling some Jimmies. Looks like you're settling into that csm role perfectly Dunk 😉

The nullbears do, sure.

You morons that like to assign labels to justify your pathetically weak argument.  Could there possibly be players that enjoy the entirety of the EvE gaming experience and thus not fit into your classification system?  Could it be that those same players believe this is a huge tilt to the sandbox?  EvE was scary because of the players, this changes the game to PvE in a big way.  That is a weak way to correct poor design.  Shake the game up? Definitely, but stop it with your “everybody’s whining” bullshit...the point against CCP on this one is valid.

give wormholes a try once you get on your feet 👍

Bad post from Uncle Dunk &gt; 3 good posts from anyone else.

Don't let/r/Eve corrupt you. Eve is a good game that has some problems, just like all other long running games.
---
Fair enough.
---
BRAVE doesn't have mandatory minimum participation in stratops so it's pretty chill as well. I spend weeks at a time alone in FW space for example.

Well of course everyone is nice, you don't have anything worth stealing yet &lt;3 It's all about the long con in Eve.

I think we have exceeded peak levels of salt, this is a whole new dimension of salt

Did you really name your reddit account with an ISD tag? Lmfao

I switched between a lot of games over time, then I found Eve Online
---
I'm sure a lot of people can relate.
---
Yes! That's exactly the charm I experienced with the really harsh environment of eve back in '04. No warping to zero, no interdiction nullification... Slowboating to gates from Querious up to empire with my Thorax... last jump I managed to jump into empire sys with 80% structure. Everything I had was in that ship, and my hold was filled with zyd / megacyte from ninjamining down there!
---
Sucks. Try to petition it to a senior, or ask for a review, and also report the bug.
---
So is going after new players/industrials/mining ships/other undefended ships called "elite pvp" but that never stopped anyone.
---
No. It's the best.
---
Nice, have only read of them, but am definitely going to explore them a little.
---
&gt;Are they hard to kill ?
---
Not for a small fleet or a carrier.
---
&gt;How is the loot ?
---
Meh
---
&gt;How much Drifters fleet are running null ?
---
It's not really possible to get a count.  You can see what they've killed here: [https://zkillboard.com/corporation/1000274/](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/1000274/)
---
&gt;why not just kill the drifters ?
---
People do.  But Drifters are a lot harder to kill than normal rats, so if they surprise you, you might die.
---
&gt;why CCP dont talk about it ?
---
Because they wanted us to be surprised.
---
&gt;why Init withdraw from war and then complain about it ?
---
The claim was that they were nearly done with their invasion anyway, and so they're heading home to kill Drifters/protect the Krablands.
---
&gt;why is it hard to kill NPCs ? isn't ratting the most common activy in titan space ?
---
High HP/resists, high damage, they use far better AI than "normal" rats and do things like scram you so you can't run away.  They also kill pods.
---
What am I looking at?
---
Shit haha
---
All according to plan.
---
Nope drained and given to drifters to make Rorq alts
---
30 minutes after initial RF? When does this occur? I don't bash very often anymore.
---
I only really played single player games before really, I google “online space game” and found eve )
---
Init sota leaked the move days before the rats stuck back.
---
They're super high DPS but it appears that these ones don't DD.  or drop loot, or care about damage cap or tether...  yeah I take it back you're right at any point they could just decide to start using DDs it's probably best to keep it to cheap stuff.  Nothing is sane you can't apply logic to it.
---
Do waffles still count as panfam? The rest of us sure dont.
---
Drifters suddenly aggro player citadels and now actively threaten big alliance sovs. Players being salty
---
Which is more likely in 2020:
---
\&gt;[VI-TY] failscade
---
\&gt;Trump reelection
---
Then don't, up to you.  However, positive player interaction is by far a better retainer than any mechanical change you could suggest.
---
Started a corp with my brother on the intention of building mainly t2 ships and equipment. Mainly for personal use and extra cash. 
---
I have set up my main HQ about 4 jumps from Dodixie. Recently found a system .5 buried in between lowsec kind of in it's own peninsula. Been watching traffic for the last couple days plus its previous history. Very rare for kills. 
---
Plenty of planets, belts and even ice. Figure the 2 low secs will be nice for whs and ratting. Plus it's only 7 away from HQ. 
---
Am I on the right track? Currently have my astero and a clone there so I can keep an eye on it.
---
I wasn’t around back then, so I have no first hand experience with her behaviour, and could care less if she posted nudes. Just don’t link them here if you go looking and find them, you’ll eat a ban for that I think.
---
Yes give them a try. ~~We~~ I mean they definitely aren’t coming there next.
---
SRP?
---
Lol. Don't need it.
---
Where is our parade?
---
I just thought your comment implied I was not doing my role which I disagree with. Running out of cap is a danger of the ship but was also circumstantial. I was just running the point and guns and MWD for so long it caught up with me (that isnt the full clip). We started farther away then got closer and I used Spike then Antimatter, neither get cap bonuses, but later on I used more Iridium which gets a 24% bonus.
---
Yes the guns use cap but our FCs decided that we'd rather use a Rail Lach over other options like the smartbomb Lach (which I really dislike), and since it has a Damage bonus I presume we just decide to use it. My guns obviously didnt do a lot of damage but they looked to do about 25-50, which is not great but not terrible. Like two Hobgoblins of damage. At longer ranges (say in an Eagle fleet) it would probably be worth losing the guns or not using them as much as the Lach struggles past 60km I find 
---
The possibility that using more Iridium ammo made a difference intrigues me tho as I hadn't thought of that being a solution/stopgap til now, I think i'll get ammo for the Lach with that I mind now. So this has been a helpful discussion o7
---
Thankfully you didn't go with Star Citizen tho!

thank you

Drifters are AI ships?
---
Eve isn't a PvP game. You can PvP in Eve, but you can also PvE in Eve. 
---
I just laugh every time I see these players put on some tough guy persona and talk about how Eve is some unforgiving hardcore PvP game that it takes some kind of Einstein level of intelligence to play. It's not. It's a space-based MMO with all of the elements of an MMO including PvE and PvP, meaning threats can come from either. 
---
If you want a true PvP game there are plenty of them out there, but Eve isn't one of them.
---
I’m out of the loop on this. Haven’t logged in in a while but was thinking of jumping back in. What’s going on..?
---
We are insulted at these notions.
---
why do people who know less than nothing about wormhole space keep saying this
---
oh wait, it's reddit. carry on
---
Okay, you form a Drifter response fleet, bridge over and kill all of them in less then fourteen minutes.  Because that is all the time you have to respond before they reinforce what they were attacking.  
---
This is far from awesome, this is another shit tier mechanic, with unintended consequences that CCP implemented without proper testing.  The only reason CCP isn't saying anything is probably because the coders are to busy trying to figure out where the code has gone wonky in the AI script, and apologize after an emergency patch fixing it.
---
Dude, EVE is not a game, it's a way of life.
---
Also it's been dying for as long as I've been playing and I've played this game since 2014. If it's dying it's sure as hell taking it's sweet ass time.
---
I don’t pve....
---
Looks that way.
---
It should be, but it hasn't been, so Plan B
---
LOL Mittens. If you were so important and control whether the game lives or dies, CCP would have strung you up by your nutsack years ago.
---
Because we have and use the most structures, this new drifter attack must be hurting us the most. Anyone in the GSF not liking the choices CCP has made is just bitching about that, and absolutely nothing else.
---
/s
---
This is such a dumb way to think. Sp in this game is not even a grind its just a time sync if you want new players at this point in time they need to be able to fly at least one good fit. If you had a friend start today I bet they would get frustrated at the fact that they can’t even really play the damn game for 1-2 months
---

Keyboard warriors will girnfest. A tale since time immemorial.
---
Yes, they're an NPC faction of weird battleships that have a Doomsday onboard. So once you rip their shields off, they EMC everyone and Doomsday aggressors. Fun fun fun.
---
Yup! I miss UO so much. If they remastered it and released the same game from the beginning, I'd play it.
---
Can confirm. Dick is undead now.
---
If you don't undock anything except Mining Ships under an umbrella, well I guess you are right. If you dreadbomb groups 15 times your size with the at that time superior titan force, then it helps ...
---
Yea we probably would :)
---
i am pretty sure as well. tony and i always got along, even though he is up in canadia land.
---
I do enjoy hyperbole and theater. I don't have to be on anyone's side to see this for what it is.

My info is just based on things I've read on other posts so it can be wrong. Thanks for correcting my mistakes
---
Is it? The mechanic's already solved.
---
I think this is a great idea! I wish I could gift these to a few of the new players that I am playing with! We need more of this!
---
Beautiful!  Share a .stl?

Drifters making Mittani bend the knee.

A lot of people mix up r/eve with the actual EVE community(s) that make up the game. R/eve is essentially a few different versions of spaceship the_donalds consisting of ~50 Horde dudes, 50 goon dudes, a few PL/NC sprinkles, handful of wormholers, a Gevlon Goblin reincarnation somewhere, and CCP marketing team fake posting about how excited they are to get back involved into EVE bc of drifter NPCs.
---
This guys knows what's up.

i'm just laughing at the "ten of thousands of real players"

Can i bum a bil ? I'm space-poor

You'll probs get downvoted to shit.

But you're right, it's akin to prepubescent teen who's just lost his xbox and is looking for attention.  But to be fair, it's the sycophants that make me cringe the hardest.

No thanks.

I’ve been chucking along in that circus for 11+ years now. Ship losses are just part of the deal.

I’m actually amazed that people make a fuss about that. If you can’t take the loss of a ship, what the fuck are you doing in EVE Online?
---
shit post level 1 completed.
---
thing is hes not wrong,this whole thing is competely fucking retarded.
---
whats next, sansha developing new tech that destroys local and stops asset safety.
---
dear ccp, go to hell
---
So ok i'm going to be very honest here. Does he realize how this "Player versus Player" thingy he whines has been interrupted was playing out? There was literally only one side showing up because it only made sense for the defenders not to (and i'm talking only gameplay wise, nothing about whether NC. deserved it and anything about World War Bee).
---
Also his remark about Olmeca only make me even happier he's got on the CSM. Keep pouring. &lt;3
---
Bounties no longer instantly inject into your account. The wreck drops tags that must be taken to hisec to turn in for isk.

Some of the friendliest and most helpful people in Eve will be ones you’ve got kill rights on.

Flex structures don't have a reinforcement _day_, just a reinforcement _time_. So reinforcement time can be anywhere from 0.5 to 25.5 hours.

\*Scribbles down a list of things to prevent any pack of egomaniacal eggers from weaponising the lowest common denominator like a swarm of . . . thugs ever again.\*
---
I think you're right on this, but I'm not sure how it's going to play out.  CCP has been taking a lot about that one battle between diamond NPCs, miners and drifters that happened naturally, and I think that might play into this at some point. Except that I think the Drifters and the Triglavians are segregated into nullsec and hisec, iirc.
---
Oh I've already done that. Doesn't quite feel the same for some reason sadly.
---
You know? 
---
I can understand if it's some little guy upset because he lost a fancy ship, they're not cheap and working for ISK is a thing you have to do.
---
But these are groups with literally trillions of ISK in Keepstars they don't even use, with capital and supercapit fleets so large they can toss two dozen titans on grid to just boson the drifters away. They have *no* reason to complain about losses because money is no object.
---
So it seems )
---
Combat anoms are the same
---
Rocket Bombers is a thing, you know. They destroy relic ceptors pretty easily.
---
HTFU
---
Oh do fuck off.
---
horde is part of panfam, though for some reason panfam as an entity doesn't often act as one entity.  it acts as NCPL, and Horde.  but they are all under 1 banner.
---
as for the keepstars,  yeah those are panfam, but are we really considering keepstars as significant losses anymore? i thought we tossed that out the door when test replaced the keepstar instantly before the hellcamp last year.
---
and Horde personally hasn't lost anything of note, not to mention its deployment has remained in TKE/gemi.  something thats annoyed us to no end....(we were told to deploy to SH1 for the war, but then all the ops were in TKE/Gemi. so we ended up forgetting about the deployment)
---
Frankly
---
Thank you drifters for tearing up 0.0, i love you
---
You can stay behind and solo around, you know. But something tells me you wont...
---
That's not really the summary is it.
---
Looked like two dudes who know each other "shooting the s**t" and kveching while one of them was waiting for the Warframe sever to come back up.
---
This is a common interaction type for males who often speak in person with other males in a group.
---
I realise this could be theater on your part calling it a "meltdown", but with you I err on the side of caution.
---
I spoke with some folks from Hadeon at GDC 2019 this year. They had a booth set up. The tech is super far off from actually becoming present in Eve. The demo they showed last year was literals a ground up implementation to show off the tech and was just using Eve art assets. There was no Eve backend/engine in it at all ~ so this basically means a Hadeon based eve is super duper far off as the game would literally have to be created with that engine in mind. The whole "legacy code" situation means Current Eve and Hadeon are virtually incompatible.
---
I'm waiting for them to start hitting IHUB's &amp; TCU's. That will bring much salt.
---
Ah, computers, where signed byte 0 - 2 == 254.  On a scale of 0 to 10...  :-)
---
Remove local and damage caps just like the drifters get. I'll show you risk
---
Yes, but people just roll their eyes when they see those elite pvpers. 
---
Now we're rolling our eyes at Goon leadership.
---
Just saw it in my feed. Love it
---
Get outta here. No one cares.
---
As far as I can see there are shitloads of super, cap and subcap targets all over the fucking place right now.  So I do wonder whether the problem here isn't that you don't have enough targets, it's that you have big bloc envy.
---
&gt; Does he realize how this "Player versus Player" thingy he whines has been interrupted was playing out?
---
Narcissists typically aren't that self aware.

CHAPTER ONE
---
unironcally, I wish they prioritized low power structures.  This would be a great mechanic to get rid of low power cit spam.  They don't though.
---
let me help you with that list friend!
---
grr goons hat hat goons
---
Spamming structures will probably decrease the chance of npc created hull timers by a massive amount. Yes it's looking like one of the ways to deal with the drifters is spam more structures.
---
That is a lot of salt from someone that doesn't even play the fucking game.
---
Alright, but remember most of us play it because it's toxic.  IDK if it's dying.  I used to play when there were 2,500 of us on the server.  Seems there are x 10 that amount at the moment.
---
the player makes the game
---
Indeed, reddit is a pretty terrible example of how good the comumity can be. In game people are great. On reddit people are pretty toxic.
---
If you want them you'll need to hit belt rat destroyers and frigates or mission sites with those types of ships as they're the ones that'll drop these.
---
The drifter fleets probably would have helped the grind tbh. Goons were staging out of lowsec anyways. I think they just went home because they were bored and already skipping bashes for brawls down in Geminate.
---
“Methyl ethyl bad shit”, we call it.
---
The only way to make that so is to break up the massive umbrellas directly and you'd be complaining a hell of a lot more about that.
---
Hope you find a good place to thrive and plenty of oportunities to lose tons and tons of ships tackling enemies and learning the ropes of that amazingly fun rol.
---
Free piece of advice: don't marry to the corp you chose! If you don't feel like you belong there for any reason, look for a new corp and so on until you find the right place.
---
Sounds basic, but lots of people are afraid of doing so in fear that it could look bad for potential recruiters or that it could hurt the feelings of the friends you made on the corp you are. Most people won't give a fuck about it, and if they do you really don't wanna be playing the game with them.
---
Fly recklessly o7
---
Have you read *any* of the posts on this forum except for mine? Everyone is praising this as the deathknell of contemporary nullsec alliances. Nearly everyone cares.
---
Great Idea, it solves all the autistic whining about local and asset safety, and the best benefit is that it will be in Sansha Space.  Go Bees!
---
I also wonder if we're going to see an escalation from Sansha, too.
---
No. We care about the event. We don't care about you. No one does.
---
Reading mittens QQ'ng in PC Gamer magazine last night made my day!
---
Yup, would be perfect if it worked that way. Maybe poke at the fueled ones, keep people on their toes, but the low power cit spam is what is the problem, and none of that is really fixed with this.
---
&gt;It looks like capsuleers will have to start defending their structures.
---
Man, NCdot called out on a scope video.
---
Whoo boy , the next episode of meta show is gonna be next level cringey. The spin and salt will be powerful
---
That was a gr8b8m8ir8it8/8
---
Sounds reasonable to me.
---
Deleting local and asset safety in null would probably be a benefit to you null plebs.  Bots would get dunked.  Bads would get dunked.  There would be some actual risk to living in null, but please cry more.
---
But they blued so much people reasonable fighting isnt possible and prefer watching netflix while grinding the Ore for a Titan in 2 days with a tabbed out Multibox with "automatted" security features like NEAR2.
---
Your remaining stuff, can I have it?
---
Given that it's your desperate, pathetic hope that this will cause us to die forever, knowing that we've solved it is probably useful for tempering your expectations. It's for your own good; hot pocket related cholesterol buildup doesn't leave y'all much room for excessive heart stressors.
---
The fascinating thing is, and let me briefly say you're an absolute fucking idiot for not seeing it, the comments have been edited to remove important context about what was being said around it.
---
You must be a CNN viewer.
---
CCP recently, and secretly, introduced a feature in which Drifter NPCs (formerly fairly non-aggressive and easy to avoid combat with) are now attacking people, and in a totally new thing, attacking player owned structures (citadels).
---
Drifters, it turns out, have a mean streak.  And they are very combat proficient.  A few rules that apply to players (damage caps when attacking stations, for example) don't seem to apply to them.  They're also sticking titan-class weapons on battleships, which is a bit alarming.
---
Mitts annoyed. I'm happy, whatever happens next.
---
Why?  It wouldn't be the first time CCP nerfed a major game mechanic because abuse of it affected game play tot he downside.  We used to have a blue donut because the only significant cap fleets (which were comparatively quite limited in size at the time) could teleport anywhere on the map.  Jump fatigue was introduce specifically to nerf that game play.

---
One of the reasons new players don't join the game is because even null became too established. This purge will force the blue blobs to actual recruit new flesh and blood players vs just creating another bot.
---
If they were going after the driffters and sleepers, this would be done in wormholes, not in K-space. Almost the same with the Sansha wormholes.
---
Maybe you should go back to WoW If you want to tackle NPC Raids.  I for one didn't sign up for this shit.

Generally one shows their disinterest in such things by not deigning to respond. Do you have a habit of stopping before every sandwich-board-clad yahoo on the street? Granted, some of those guys have beards that put ZZ-Top to shame, so I can understand that temptation a little.

They don't want this.
---
I have always been of the opinion that you have to be able to lose ships.
---
I’m not saying you have to like it. It very often is an inconvenience and a big pain in the ass to replace it [context-depending].
---
With regards to ‘safety’, in 0.0, in EVE Online, get real already! Go out, find someone to kick them in the nuts or die trying.
---
What I will say though is that resources to built ships to fight for resources to build ships is... not enough incentive for me. There should be more at stake.
---
This was a fun insult, good job.
---
Pretty much ja, though you could include PvP metrics also as I don't think bots typically engage in that. Though the system would need to be at least mostly occult or people would make their bots duel each other periodically or something
---
Please do. I came back recently after having originally played just shortly to mess around with mates who have years worth of SP. Was already feeling like quitting since everything felt too advanced to catch up but wormholes are really something that evens it out for newbros. IMO they offer a fairer challenge instead of just getting gatecamped randomly.
---
&gt; and do what we like to do

I care about responding because I'm bored and we are both pressing refresh as fast as possible to see what response the other has for us.
---
As much as you fight it, you're begging for my response. You crave it. But what happens when it stops? Will you continue or cease to exist under the weight of your own lack of mental fortitude?
---
The world finds out... now. But no one cares.

Or tie it to the achievs. Select 10 reasonable achievs and when you accomplish one of these you get one useful support skill upgraded to IV.

That is appreciation appropriation, and I'm highly offended right now because of it

TLDR: I can't deploy my massive supercap fleet in 100% safety, CCP bad

It's Alive and well!

 I kinda dread the day CCP "fixes" lowsec...

I came back a couple of weeks ago after 10 years, and I'd say that if anything the community has gotten better.

Story time: got my prized Vexor (which I only got because I was advised that drones are awesome - and they are) and was traveling through low sec to get to a Sister's mission. Nabbed by pirates and I offered 30 mill because I REALLY liked my Vexor. They agreed, but just as I paid them, they blew me up. 
---
They appologized and gave me a refund! That never happened ten years ago.
---
You should probably fuck off too.
---

So, Triglavians attack the Core, while Drifter are messing with Null..
---
Looks like fun times abound.
---
Uh, of course I want people to respond to what I say. It's a forum. That's the point of posting. I never claimed any form of disinterest. That's some 中二病 shit right there. Generally, you grow out of that.
---
Keep being an idiot.
---
That's easy if you have a highsec static. If you don't have a highsec static that might lead to burn out. You further said you're a small corp. That made me assume you're not solo. If you have 5-10 real people in corp you will pile up stuff and people will go afg.
---
EVE has one of the best communities out there, especially when it comes to new players.  The ones that are chill and respectful are often brought in and given a wealth of stuff to help them along, while the toxic ones are often publicly ridiculed.
---
I wish I could find the video again, but it was either Goon or TEST propaganda about four misconceptions of new players.  It sums up how a shift in mentality is what many people need when thinking about fresh players.
---
My comment in no way implies I didn't read it. I did. After reading the rest of your posts though I can't really hold it against you - pretty sure your reading comprehension issues are related to your tism.
---
Both of your corps hate pvp so the fact you two enjoy fighting each other is amazing

How about when about 45000 are logged in. Those were good fights

Rigor mortis is just another way to say I love you.

I disagree. I've seen games run into the ground by [mail.ru](https://mail.ru) \- CCP do actually stand out from the masses.

Not our fault our 'enemies' let us recover and build up that umbrella.  Where was NCPL, for two years after the declared that Goons wouldn't be able to form a fleet of 200 frigates without them stomping on us again?
---
People have so many options these days and a lot of today's younguns really don't want to put too much effort into getting to grips with Eve.  It's not an easy game to like but once you're hooked...

Trust me when I say its some of the older bored guys who love spreading salt. Eve is still great and I've been playing since 04. There isn't another game that is this  in depth as eve is. You can literally take so many paths in it. You can be a ninja too.
---
Inb4 the reason the invasion stops isn't because CCP have changed the code, but because the drifter AI gets so salty at having to constantly structure bash and entosis that they just stop bothering.

---
Honestly if they wanted to stay up there and continue to ‘glass’ tribute whilst good off the evil drifter menace they could.
---
Sounds like a nice find; try to find out who is running the local constellation and if they have an Intel Channel. Befriend them if you can, maybe offer them nice deals for protection if need be.
---
Also read up on the Micro-warp + Cloak trick to run your supplies in and out, when not using a jump freighter or carrier agencies. Blockade runners work very well most of the time. Try go set some saves around gates and off grid in the low sec systems, for when a band of people does a flyby. Then you can warp to zero on those.
---
If you are shipping high value loads yourself, use an out of corp alt to camp the pipe while shipping your stuff in/out. Just have it sit in one system of the pipe, preferably, so the locals dont link it to your corp's shipping activity. 
---
Also, have that alt online a lot, have it cloaked on a safe somewhere when not gaming (else people will notice you undocking just everytime someone ships stuff through the pipe); do a safe-log when you have to shutdown your computer, so you can return to the safe on logon. Can be a very simple clone and ship, but I like one with a good scan bonuses, so you can scan system with combat probes when the need arises. Just try to have a deep safe, so you wont be noticed on a casual scan from local players when you login/out.

Have another bookmark on the in/out gate of the pipe when you want to see the gate of the pipe itself, so you can put your alt on that spot to watch traffic and scan people coming/going through the pipe. 
---
Btw; WH's create very nice opportunities for off-grid save spots. Since you can warp between the WH and the furthers planet (in example). Unless the local gate is on that planet ;)...
---
&gt; wipe out all the null and leave it inhabited with drifters   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;  without whining and tears of null inhabitants 
---
Both together will never work.
---
We should log out to deny them fights
---
Because that's player driven. If CCP had a magic wand to force people to fight i'm sure they'd have used it, but diplomacy is an out of game mechanic, there's nothing they can do about that.
---
They can make things like forced scarcity and depletion and variation of space to provide a reason to fight, but if people don't want to fight, they won't.
---
Yeah, we have HS static, or maybe just when the connection is close to a market hub. A trip once or twice a week wouldn't be too bad
---
In game
---
You know how many players will quit after such thing will happen?
---
Not arguing, but Warframe's sort of known for being good at it. And Elite: Dangerous suppot team is legendarily good at the actual support and communication with the players - although there are many of those who say the game itself could be much better.
---
And then they still have a massive superiority in subs.
---
I found it odd you mentioned a toxic community when you posted this on reddit, a toxic community.
---
Emergent AI gameplay.
---
I'm curious as to why they mentioned "Vulnerable" anyway, given that Citadels are always in that state now.
---
thats why they look like bl00dy toothpicks (my standard ship name for enyos)
---
Yknow I only subscribed to this sub to keep updated on cool shit since I left EVE. And I think the reason I've never gone back is because of this sub. I'm gonna unsub and maybe that'll encourage me to come back unbiased, cos I do miss EVE.
---
Here's the thing though - realistically interceptor explorers will tend to be the more experienced ones.
---
Without bonuses to scanning or hacking, they rely on having good (SP and player) skills. Not having a covops cloak will also mean a bit less safety, and fitting a normal cloak without bonuses to cloak CPU usage will gimp your fit. All things that a more experienced player would be willing to deal with - they'd be fine sacrificing scanning strength, because more SP in scanning skills and knowledge of how not to be bad at scanning makes up for it, they'd be fine without a hull hacking bonus because again, they'll probably have more SP in the hacking skill and have more experience doing the minigame. If they put a normal cloak and adjust their fit - they'll be well aware their fit is gimped and fly accordingly.
---
A newbie in a ceptor would not be doing himself any favors and probably also not gonna take full advantage of the ceptor's benefits, an experienced explorer would be applying his knowledge and skills to achieve the same goal with a different ship, letting said knowledge and skills make up for the drawbacks of the ship.
---
you know im kind of upset that i had to cancel fleets to fight drifters instead of players, but im happy ccp is at least trying new shit. its nice to see them trying to shake things up
---
They're learning from us.
---
They'll occupy NC. space and then turbo krab
---
CCP said it was intended immediately, publicly.
---
All those screenshots and I’m not in any of them. Fuck whom ever took them
---
Doomsdays are self destruct devices? I don’t actually play the game, but I love keeping up with everything going on. No other game like it
---
You had just cleared a region, there were no new timers. You had the perfect opportunity to manage the drifters and continue the war, but do go on trying to justify this cockup
---
No they didn't.  It came out of petition response.
---
Get a computer that isn't shit.
---
Quite literally exactly what I said.
---
They are just bee'ist
---
with 0% player retention :D as no one logs into the account again :D
---
And many of them being adults now who can not put those hours in the game anymore. I have been in eve since 2010. And looking what is happening with that invasion.
---
Idk what you're trying for here but it didnt work.
---
&gt;you just had the perfect opportunity to split your forces but didn't
---
well, duh.
---
Actually there are many small groups/communities on discord that out of principle don't n+1 opponents, don't use caps and bet on quality over quantity.
---
Yeah, I'm such an RMTer and wasn't falsely accused that I tried to kill myself. Nope, totally guilty here bro.
---
No, Doomsdays are strong nearly 1 hit KO weapons. Titans normally have them, deleting subcapitals in a single blast. Drifters have them yet fly subcapital battleships, this gives them an insane power advantage as you'd have to specifically make a super tank fit just to barely survive and then suffer in DPS.
---
QFC  Undocked !?!?!?!? Fuck me you must have got them on a good day!
---
....what?
---
When did I suggest there weren't enough targets? What about anything I said would suggest big bloc envy?
---
This is an exceptionally ignorant assessment
---
Jump cloning isnt splitting you forces what the fuck kind of stupid are you? You jump, and jump back. OR you set an empty clone, kill clone to delve, handle the message and the jump clone back north, whole thing done in an hour.
---
Weird I didnt read your petition, they announced it on Twitter,
---
like i said earlier, assuming you only have to do that once a day.
---
logoff your tapi spy login your goon spy duh
---
Now can you look into my false ban and get it reversed?
---
We needed money at one point so he paid a monthly fee for access to the TEST forums so he could have material for his blog.  He then stopped paying for two months and went max shitbag on the forums to manufacture drama he could then write about.  He owes us something like 20b for back forums access from that period.
---
As I said, a cope.
---
I agree on all points, except:
---
&gt;Their main air support, which is devastatingly effective, is used like twice.
---
I believe the point was to hold the dragons from entering the fight until the night king had shown up. He had already demonstrated that when left alone he can easily take care of a dragon, so it would have been best if he was distracted with the main fight/getting to Bran, and was not on his own dragon. That's why John Snow was not exactly happy that Danny decided to yolo her dragon when she saw them start to lose, even though the night king was still not on field.
---
I agree, yesterday I was lurking tama inciting violence and a blob of 8 to 12 ships fitted with double scrams and distrupts decided to follow endlessly with a logi, even in grid space to blow me up and not themselves up. I told them that karma is real and it determines who you are in life and if bad karma is what rules the day it is what brings hordes of Eve players to leave and never return. Like a domino, if each every individual that plays Eve is a bad NPC who doesn’t eve agro the person next to them on suspect or chooses the method of team fight not solo fight plus stream snipes and acts like NPC vs good karma player eventually all the good players will leave in droves and what will remain is the niche culture they currently have all to themselves.
---
It was in the talking in stations discord. I commented directly after a couple of those
---
&gt;A ship in harbour is safe, but that is not what ships are for.
---
You need to read up on the concept of the fleet in being.
---
That CCPs shit mechanics over the last three years mandated that you invested in infrastructure and pve hard or fall behind in the proverbial arms race.  It doesn't matter how good your tactics and pilots are if they're outclassed and outnumbered.  I think it's a shit set of mechanics but I recognize that all the groups on top of the game right now are ones that did it.
---
My biggest regret is I can only upvote this once
---
Not an answer, but Talking in Stations has episodes that scratch a similar itch for me. It’s available as a podcast or Youtube  channel or twitch stream.
---
Sometimes I go back in their past podcast episodes and listen to coverage from during events people mention to me. And it’s a good way to keep current with the emerging history.
---
&gt;Bad bait post is bad
---
It's not baiting for viewers. I streaming just for have replays
---
I'm disappointed to hear they didn't talk to the CSM about it.  CCP has a long track record of releasing features without fully understanding the implications of what they're doing.  Part of why the CSM exists is to discuss this sort of thing with representatives from the player base.  Depending on how the mechanics of this invasion work this could easily be one of those things that initially appears good but ultimately hurts the game in the long term and the fact that CCP implemented it with zero player feedback scares me.
---
I don’t like the whole injection/extraction scheme and what it’s done to EVE, but Im pretty happy about the 1m SP pack tbh. 
---
I bought it on each of my accounts because injection isn’t a viable option anymore. Everyone ready to jump off a bridge because “CCP is selling SP” has to keep in mind that you can only do this once per account (NOT character) ever ever. And that’s a Sandlot style for-ev-er. 
---
It’s honestly nice to have this option on an older character in case I want to impulsively train something without spending a fortune because of Chinese bots. One million SP isn’t even a lot.
---
Pvp players bend knee to npcs. **Diamond rats master race.**
---
omg, rly? full game on maximum settings + stream = 100+ fps. Shit PC, ok.
---
"It seems that capsuleers from the outer regions have to start defending their structures \[..\]"   
---
Imagine my shock!!
---
Next logical step would be representation in the CSM.
---
I wouldn’t mind doing that.
---
Player-driven content model is amazing when there are players who create content.
---
Awwww.... such a shame... They will join the thousands of players you bored out of Eve then.
---
No, train bot. Not now.
---
I already did, waiting for the response. Thanks.
---
I don't have a huge amount of faith, but I'm willing to give this a chance. That said, if they do just force everyone to stay at home, rather than roaming and creating content I'm probably just going to move to Lowsec. I have no problem with Adapting instead of Dying.
---
It takes 2 to blow up a super. The are stupid
---
could there be? sure, hell i'd say there are, but when pretty much all the whining conveniently comes from one group mostly after their main paper pushers host an emergency meeting about it you start to get the noggin joggin
---
For me it's that I have 80m skill points now and injectors aren't worth crap. Not that I injected much any way, just occasionally, but 1m SP is like 7 injectors, so 7 billion isk worth.
---
&gt; Actual PVP warfare
---
TIL citadels are players
---
except that he was describing ccp shutting down pvp (their business model)
---
Yeah, that gave me a proper chuckle :)
---
I remember the party line being "muh do you really think we'll ever get bored of shooting NPCs I mean we're goons lol"
---
2 days later...
---
We *want* you to have shit to steal.
---
Where do you think the stories come from?
---
It's not stupid. It's balance. Please stop crying.
---
I've been summoned
---
&gt; parameter
---
Impressed ccp is shaking things up
---
The twist is that this community even on Reddit (!) goes above and beyond to help newbies. If you are playing for a while already things MIGHT change, depending on the group you play in. Most important: do what you enjoy, it's a game after all. (Don't be a jerk over it though.)
---
Nice shit post

\-1 point for not referring to this: [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77510852](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77510852) as a Providence Providence in Providence.

I'm interested in joining a wormhole Corp to run combat sites and pvp in. Do I need to be skilled into a t3c and if so should all my t3c skills be at 5 before I try to fly one? I would be training into a Loki if that matters.

This is r/Eve , where "Bee man Bad," gets you at least 50 fake internet points.

The quality of reeeee today from goons is on point
---
maybe they only attack +/- 6 hours of vuln window?  they seem to only go for about 12 hours at a time before stopping for the night.
---
I'm at 95M skill points now, and I totally see where you are coming from! o7
---
That pack was as awesome for older player as it was for the new guys.
---
If there was I missed it before I posted.
---
CCP doesn't have a problem getting new players, according to their own stats.  They get thousands of new ones per month.  Maybe if their NPE wasn't such shit some of those people would stick around.  This benefits older players more than new players.  Thus the complaints.
---
Me three! There's dozens of us!
---
Give him a break, he hasn't trained Reading Comprehension to 5 yet (if at all).
---
It was monitoring this place which brought us to the conclusion that capsuleers must be subjugated.
---
Quit EVE three years ago. Literally just resubed today after reading about all the new drifter shenanigans. Here's to hoping that CCP are finally ready to stop hiding behind the "sandbox" excuse and actually bulk out the game a little.
---
/r/rareinsults
---
That's uh, that's a pretty weird story right there hoss
---
I don't believe you.   You could have been spending your isk on ships and fighting other players for a "challenge" if that's what you wanted.  150 billion isk in liquid could buy you a months worth of "challenges".
---
SaltSpinner in motion

&gt; a cope.

ye you're retarded
---
Join E-Uni and take advantage of their nullsec campus in NPC syndicate. You'll get fairly regular small gang fights and you'll be able to learn quick on what to or not to do in regards to getting initial tackle for the fleet.  Good group of people and they're happy to help.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Applying_to_EVE_University
---
They've researched Duct Tape technology, far advanced above the rest. Allows you to basically duct tape any feature of a higher class of ship onto a lower tier. However, researching Duct Tape to level 5 is required to learn Flex Seal which allows you to seal two features instead of one.
---
Very cutting edge.
---
And nothing of value was lost
---
Citadels have timers that stretch for a week Dave, you'd only have to do that oncve a day.
---
and they can be shot at any time.
---
Oh cool - I’ve found a group that has been really helpful, and I’m using EvE Uni’s website a lot but I never knew they were an ingame thing as well.
---
Like I said, they've struggled to find a way for years and years now. Sure it's a PvE event that's causing it, but your argument that the whole game is changing to PvE is false and shortsighted.
---
First of all, it should be pretty obvious that this isn't a permanent event. It's a cataclysm to reshape the sovereignty of space. If they left the game like this forever I'd agree, but that seems completely unlikely.
---
At the end of the event, there will still be all the PvP aspects  of EvE that there always have been.
---
That still misses the point. The point is that there should be no expectation of any specific event type (aka bitching that it's a pve event), because it's not a specific play type game. 
---
It's also funny to see huge powerhouses relegated to station camping, just like all those little guys they like to wardec and crush
---
Thanks bud!! o7
---
Organizing a subcap fleet takes more time and effort than dropping supers and is more open to counter.
---
I'm mostly against the notion that SRP is needed to PvP in this game and I find that argument to be relatively thin. 
---
Making isk is easy, and does not take a huge amount of effort. Do I agree that passive income was better? Yeah kinda. Is it needed and we can't afford to fight without it? No, not at all. Would I welcome a change, like a module that pulled moon ore over time but left the field vulnerable to vultures, yeah, but I haven't put the brain cycles on it to nug out the second order effects that would have.
---
No, it's perfect. Apart from that DD power - it should one-shot titans.
---
haha
---
Sure, you're absolutely right, however that didn't need to be sprawl either, which it has obviously become.  This is actually punishing you for sprawl, the hilarity of it all is that to beat it requires MORE sprawl but w/e.
---
The point is that nobody but goons had to stop fighting an actual war for this (and they didnt have to either if they'd suppressed their panic response), and the rewards for doing this are the literal exact same as the rewards for fighting a player war (since player wars have been reduced to boring tedium and bullshit in most instances)
---
Behind every salty username on this sub is a nice eve player
---
Eh, he admitted as much in the last mumble speech he did about this shit. He had a bug up his ass about going to Malpais to keep burning shit down, but all the FCs in the relevant TZs were pretty burnt, so he acknowledged that we'd probably be heading home anyways. It's not like there needs to be some grand narrative about this shit; FC burnout is a thing and you don't need to whitewash it.
---
Haha that’s awesome! My first death was to a gate camp but it was only a rifter not a Cruiser )
---
I don't think the writer of this piece has a very good reading on what is happening here.
---
At least to me it looks like a long-awaited mechanic to lessen the structure spam a little.
---
Lmao - **The** 'CCP didn;t consult me before adding content' **Mittani** \- what a fucking moron.
---
See! not all Bee man bad, just some aren't the brightest. Some are pretty cool peeps. And honestly from what I've hear of The Mittani... well he drinks a bit to much of his own Kool-aid if you catch my drift.
---
same for me back then when i switched from null to building something new in wormholes
---
i personally make less money now (all these investments you have to do as leadership, FUuCcck), but contrary to the mindless lonely ISK farming we play together now and I have waaaaaaay more fun (same for the others).
---
I for one welcome our new Drifter overlords. I have to say it'd sure be funny to see them kill an unprepared Titan fleet or something.
---
wow... I heard he was a douche but... wow.... what a douchbag
---
&gt;  we just did other shit ..
---
This is Eve, and while I 100% support your right to play how you want, at the end of the day you chose that. 
---
&gt; It is just no point trying to keep up with groups 10-times or more bigger than you 
---
I don't understand why small groups feel they NEED to try to keep up with large alliances. Of course you can't keep up. This is where the "it's not fair" mentality starts to creep in, but it isn't even about game mechanics at this point, just a large difference in numbers. When I was in wormholes the thought of "keeping up" with anyone never even occurred to me. we just did our thing, and killed what we could, and had fun. Again, this is not game mechanics, but a difference in numbers.
---
&gt;.. for an anonymous lemming horde of multiple thousands 
---
If this is how you perceive life to be in the Imperium, I hate to break it to you, but this has not been my experience at all. Still not a game mechanic.
---
&gt;  It just was not realistic nor would have been any fun to any of us.. 
---
I agree, the grind in Eve sucks. No one that I know finds it 'fun' to grind. But in the current game, one has to grind "something" in order to get what you want. Burners, mining, ratting, market trading, reactions, production, escalations, exploration, all require ingame effort. Having decent people around to lessen the burden of this makes it much less cancerous. The reward for that effort is moving up a class in ships, or finally being able to run the blops for your bomber gang, or whatever your goal was. We suffer through the pve bullshit, in order to do what we want. 
---
If you want isk generation to be easier, that is fine, just remember it will become easier for the big groups as well. Again, a numbers game.
---
Your post boils down to your own choice on how to play (which is fine), and a perceived slight that small groups cannot "compete" with larger ones (which no game mechanic will ever fix).
---
The only one of these you can control is your own choices.
---
Awesome to hear! Also, yes to ninjas.
---
Dave are you gnawing on a foam couch cushion or what bud?  You have DAYS after its shot to respond.  You dont need to be there the second its being shot, since the reinforcement happens in 3 fucking minutes you god damned idiot, you show up and make sure they dont finish the thing off.
---
Like holy shit you gigantic pussy.
---
Nobody with a good computer is regularly losing ships to client problems.
---
Fair point ) I suppose I was referring to how the game’s community had been portrayed to me.
---
There is a volume II inbound. He is nearing completion i think.
---
You don't speak for anyone. Plz STFU forever. We don't need another tryhard edgelord that thinks he is on that next level bc he left goons for NC.
---
 Spoiler Alert: You in fact are just another face in the crowd. A nobody posting like a somebody.
---
THE SALT MUST FLOW!!
---
Was pretty clear from the outset that tribute was going to be where it stopped. I’m unsure why he feels the need to spin a massive narrative about it.
---
I honestly would have gone home the second it was clear NC were going to stay docked.
---
Do you always post the same thing Dumbledore.
---
I recommend Malevelon Roe Industries,  a corp based in highsec, led by a duder names PocketsDK who also runs a [youtube channel with helpfull videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbg-uWmjTl4YE5y1eDL7gA) and is kind of in the care of u/Ashterothi who has always been a dedicated member of the community.
---
lol, well maybe one day I’ll be space rich and can lose it all gloriously.
---
Imp,test and panfam are always looking
---
Flair checks out
---
We love you too - thanks for becoming one of us &lt;3
---
Hopefully we'll cross paths at some point and can exchange ammunition!
---
fuck you. gimme your isk and ill double it
---
Its almost as if you didn’t notice CCP fucked the game up so bad they have to make better PvE to drive content because the players can’t or won’t anymore.
---
Not. Possible. Since drifters have taken over eve. They just burn everything. Null. High and low.
---
Start running. Drifter wont just do the kneecap.
---
Lol CCP cleaning the servers off all the structure spam
---
&gt; We're blue to about 30%
---
it should give you pause that you unironically said that in response to a hyperbolic comment.
---
Nah, you got it wrong. The other whining
---
Sure, if your objective is to engage in spaceship fights, that makes sense. Ours wasn't. Our objective was to burn down everything. We accomplished that. Mittani wanted more, FCs said no, he relented. The anger about the Drifter shit is on an abstract level rather than a practical level.
---
I would love to see drifters 3rd party a cap fleet:).
---
You care cupcake. It shows in your posting. The little bee that lost its way is still buzzing around fussing about. Godspeed rageline. You gonna need it.
---
thank you provibloc for undocking and fighting us, time and time again! (◕‿◕✿) and thank you to all the small corps/alliances that make up the non-tidi content that makes eve great! (◕‿◕✿)
---
I mean can you really read a grown man unironically calling people "pubbies" without feeling at least a little...disgusted?
---
'The Scope' continues its biased Fake News coverage by using terminology such as *"Drifter menace"*.
---
But i want this
---
It's a bunch of moral grandstanding to cover over one's own feelings of powerlessness.
---
i guess when pl/nc can't win any victories in game they're reduced to cheerleading npcs and hoping the npcs can win the victories panfam couldn't, lawl
---
Presumably to keep up the sense of unreliability of remote reporters.
---
and people own multiple structures.
---
Yeah fair call. How far through tribute did you guys get?
---
it could enable them to fix a lot of old broken crap and add some things that might get new players (WiS/Space Barbie game play)  I always thought they had shifted to a new game after the summer of rage, and have been slowly prepping us for whats coming.  All the upgrades and things to the back end would make a ton of sense for an EvE2
---
Every upwell structure dead except one fortizar, if I'm remembering correctly. I am not sure if we killed all the POCOs or not.
---
You’re not wrong ya know lol
---
I am lol, been playing for just 2 weeks and already lost 400mil worth of asteros to srrat bombers 😯
---
Me too
---
Overall its a good community. There are only a handful of toxic adults trying to get revenge for being stuffed in a locker in highsec still playing.
---
Yikes. Oh well looks like the drifter invasion came at the right time then.
---
Definitely in 2010 it was dying.
---
if you like the lore side of eve's history as well as the player side of it - i recommend ashterothi's stuff, that's always good. he does stuff for TIS and i think he did the hydrostatic? podcast before that.
---
Oh snap!
---
happy that i left goons :)
---
We h aven't really been panfam since leaving PL I think. Still blue and such but not even on good terms with all of panfam lol. Horde still bros though. We're #wormholersbtw anyway now so that doesn't matter much at this point anyway lol.
---
Nah, drifters were the ancient entity and Sansha were “hivelinked” foreign narodnya or something.
---
I got shot up my first day in Pandemic by some goons. I musta spooked em with my venture of death. I had the money to replace it hundreds of times over and I didn't have any implants when the pod went up, so I sent a friendly message and they even apologized! Never woulda went down like that in elite.
---
&gt; That is the view of someone from an anonymous nullsec Megablob with greedy leadership 
---
Again, this is just not factually correct.
---
KarmaFleet provides over 100 max frack moons for its members to mine, exclusively, at zero cost. The alliance also provides public moons. Refining is taxed. That's it. We also provide additional SRP on top of the Allliance SRP, so that a KF pilot seldom loses money if they die on a fleet. Logi pilots ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY if they get killed on a fleet. We also provide SRP for newbees that die to NPC's while ratting. Yes, you read that correctly. 
---
The bottom up model provides for all of this, and more, and we are just 1 corp in GSF. 
---
This is the polar opposite of "greedy leadership". 
---
I appreciate your passion on this subject, but facts are facts, and in this post you were incorrect.
---
thank you capsuleers we appreciate the positive response of some of you to the initial phases of peacekeeping operations against the triglavian terrorists
---
My point is that it's a lot harder because CCP focused on what they considered 'Endgame' - their word, not mine - content for the past 5 years. Basically, titan fights in null sov.
---
So... Shaking up the establishment... Yeah, that can be upsetting.
---
"Let them eat ~cake~ isk!"

Big, if true

I think one did kill a super

---
&gt;If you want to play a game where you can lose the entire contents of your wormhole in value in a single small nullsec skirmish, play eve.
---
You might be underestimating the value of the assets in a wormhole. 30-40b isn't that much when each mainline ship costs 2b each. Add in rigged fortizars and capitals that have to justify their existance by mass and things get expensive quickly.
---
There is one way to defeat drifters. Because subcap cap and supercap is suicide since they upgraded everything on the drifters.

Thought this was just your reuglar shitpost. Wasnt. *Happy Noises*

The sslt is everywhere.
---
The drifter is the salt. 
---
It is here
---
Ah players vs citadels. The Pinnacle of pvp.
---
High Drag podcast? he’s on there, it’s good.
---
don't be salty just because you're bad in a video game, there are plenty of other things to do in life to feel adequate.
---
It is open to counter until the enemy has so many it is unnecessary to try anything.
---
I don't LIKE it, and I argue with sappo sometimes about it myself, but it is what it is right now. Test isn't a democracy, my friends are in Dreddit, and I'm still getting fights.
---
When I stop getting fights I'll probably leave!
---
By this comment you are stating that's it's apparently to much for you lol. It's okay papa mittens will make a safe space for you in delve where you're 95 rorquals wont have to face the other kids in the sandbox :).
---
Falin_Whalen man bad
---
Nah if he were actually relevant to their bottom line with all of his negativity and shit spewing they'd have sued him into oblivion. He's just an empty sack.
---
That explains why he seems to be responding to people that aren't there(including Olmeca).
---
Thats truen panfam does. Not need structures. They dont want to undock. Ps::  Drifter will shoot npc stations as well. CCP. Make it so that low sector npc can be reffed. I wonder how quick ppl start running hehehe
---
Sure why not just buy me another beer
---
Anyone ever read Armada by Ernest Cline? Maybe this is the beginning of the trianing if so. That's all I have to say to avoid spoilers.
---
editing the comment is important, you're comments didn't achieve the appropriate level of salt
---
I love it. The panic is proof they were too comfortable. EvE shouldn't be comfortable.
---
All that salt because people no longer feel unreproached in their massive swathes of nullsec.
---
Yes, because more effort and work = laziness. Oh how joyous it must be to be a simple bee who knows nothing about actual work and just stands kn the back of the bees who came before. Lol
---
use https://eve-corps.com/ :)
---
Drifter salt and people trying to sspin.
---
Ha! Fucking love it
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77511726/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77511726/)  or dieing to them.. lol
---
That said, I'm in nullsec for exploring right now and I'm about 20 jumps from any decent company ships.
---
My jump clones are in stupid places
---
i'm happy you left too!
---
inb4 MER shows new isk faucet in goon space
---
Drifters are patrolling your area. be careful. They shoot everything
---
Not sure what side if the war u are on. But if u want thrills and to use your titan.  Click jump instead of bridge and enjoy that trill.  I suggest having new underwear within arms reach.
---
I guess not, I’m very low on the salt level for this drifter thing. I like it a bunch personally
---
No, sorry if it came across that way. I thought it was funny that narcissists aren't self aware, since by definition a narcissist can only see that everything is about themselves.
---
Well, welping 60 Dreads would not be possible in todays Meta for a group of the size we were when we pulled this off more often than any 6 months or so when all possible alliance scale income is now tied to hours of grinding or even being forced to create and inject additional accounts just for that to stay competitive. Yes ISK making is not soo hard, i blitz Burners for avg. 500 Mio ISK/hr. But that is so tedious and boring that I can force myself to do this about 4-5 hrs a month maybe. But dont be ignorant, if in Goons or in TEST and not having at least 3 Rorq-Alts you can leave mining afk, than you are a casual poor pleb now.
---
Just go back and say fuck it to this sub, play what you enjoy because you enjoy it. Or don't come back, either way do what will make you happy not what you think others in here will approve of.
---
Not yet important I think
---
Are you ever going to take pubbie Mittani's dick out of your mouth? You've been doing this for years both here and on SA. Yes I'm a goon, and don't bother trying to figure out who i am, for I quit this garbage years ago.
---
One Hel isn't enough. The supers must all be purged

Breaking News: The Scope actually reports on something in a timely manner.
---
Oh, and also drifters and shit.
---
Its the imbalances in the salt drifter force. 
---
At least it scares.the bots away. I guess.
---
They undock..
---
The salt levels are indeed massive, but they aren't coming from those pics, lol.
---
Oh hey haha, thanks &lt;3
---
The mittani tears, best tears:)
---
might be it, i'm not sure.
---
i rate all of his lore stuff though if that's your jam.
---
Did you know you can spend IRL money to get instantly rich and then profit off those fabulous deals in Jita.
---
They bend everybodies knees and kneecaps. 
---
This weeekend drifter spawns in jita and burns eveerything. Perimeter as well
---
If this doesn't embody Pot and Kettle I don't know what ever will.
---
Drifters spotted in Tama. Eveeryone sock up. Its a driffter carrier
---
Drifters are Jovian. The ai's that run the anomalies are the reason AI is banned in the Jovian empire. This isn't theory but confirmed fact from ccp.
---
The lore around the triglavians is that it is a different dimension entirely, not some other constellation in this dimension.
---
3.5 asteros?
---
It's okay when it's free - my point exactly. Even outright said it while you obviously didn't read.  
---
You can't tell CCP not to be greedy while being greedy yourself at the same time.
---
it's ok, let the reddit warriors reee, they'll forget this is even a thing next week and move on to the next outrage lol
---
So what does a bunch of stuff that's still possible have to do with that point?
---
One Borg or some guy that's totally from Destiny 2
---
I mean, we had incursion, which brought in a bunch of NPC incursions that nobody fucking does.
---
this is an editted screenshot of the conversation, cherry picked and slapped in for maximum ree and karma farm
---
and they all still have week long timers dave, jesus christ bud stop clutching your pearls.
---
Midly Mid tier posting at its peak
---
Once again Malpais survives by literally being so irrelevant that people get bored before they finish their laundry list of places to purge.
---
You can blue 99% of the server and camp the remaning 1% in npc stations while still calling it pvp sweetie.
---
The rage I’ve heard repeated the most is the “how do we prepare for what comes next?”
---
If you don't play eve, no one gives a fuck who you are.
---
Dough will rise.
---
Oh wow! I didn't recall that! Thank you!
---
Source? I wanna say Penny Arcade but I have not seen their comic in forever. The style just reminds me of theirs.
---
upvoted
---
CCP has dubbed this new AI program the Reddit files
---
I'd come back. The game has become stale.
---
They're easy to kill. Web them and corm or hit them with cap fighters.
---
initial reports had drifters following up on jump bridge hull timers.  It's looking now like that might have just been bad luck, but I see exactly why they knee-jerked that way.  With no information you have to plan for the worst, and that was drifters following up to every timer they make, and potentially making 20-60 a day if they happened during fleet ops in the north.  Even if it's just luck of the draw for follow up timers, you can't ignore them.  We thankfully are fighting a war with a neighbor instead of across the map, but even then we are being cautious with how much offensive effort we commit until we figure out how much defensive effort it's going to take to deal with these.  Long term, any human stamina wasted on non-pvp mechanics is a bad design in my book.
---
All I can say is that you either ignore, or do not understand my points. Where do you take from that "small " groups" need to keep up with bigs at the same scale is a mystery to me. What I wrote about is that there always (for 14 years) in EVE was a niche for PvP-Players creating a form of Corp-/Alliance-Level-Income making things possible. That is now gone. Nobody says 200 Lowseccers should be able to take space in Delve, but they should be able to rule their regional pocket as long as no bigboi directly deploys to them (hell we made NC/PL deploy just for us because of taking moons) and generate some income from it that would allow them funstuff like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyeZhnUX7NQ. This balance is gone ... 100%  ... within 1 day ... and people less resilient and social than me just said "f**k it" and quit (50% total in 5 years). And if you do not see that this developement hurts you too, I cannot help you.
---
Took my buddy and I a year to dig through all the in game lore to figure it out. And then ccp went and spilled all the beans in their book like a week before we finished. We went on the forums to tell everyone and they said "yeah we know we read the book too". We were all "what book?" lol
---
police skin paint incoming?
---
Nice work!
---
I am really confused because this update is about Triglavin whatever’a invasion, why its not them but drifters roaming null sec?
---
As opposed to needing an easy mode so you can sit in your haven with no risk?
---
I hadn't thought about this song in years.
---
I agree to a point sadly all mine are athanors which cant defend themselves from shit lol
---
truthfully i dunno about panfam, but from a line member perspective over the other side, it really seems like a whole lot of overblown smoke atm, i mean sure they are attacking structures and sure if you're an idiot and try to rat in the same system you'll die.. but t1 suicide destroyers in mass easily repel any attack, you can also outrange them or use supers.. seems pretty meh tbh
---
People might actually have to learn how to play the game past cheap wins through super blobs? The horror...
---
I *think* what he's trying to say is it's ironic that narcissists, while hugely self-absorbed, are not self-aware. Which I too think is a bit ironic.
---
How narcissistic of you to assume he was talking about you. /s
---
\*Squints, attempts to translate, fails\*

which is pretty irrelevant if they aren't close to each other....
---
look i upvoted you, but wrong time to post i feel like, the anti goon on here is strong and you didnt put on that picture anywhere 'fuck goons' so.. you must be supporting that goon (bag)
---
why is nc still an alliance lmao
---
they have no purpose, just a budget horde at this point
---
We also wish to remind you that Ouelletta also blackjack and hookers.
---
They eat meat!
---
*We're meat!"
---
suicide destroyers works, supers work, outranging them works, theres plenty of ways to repel them tbh
---
Nice to get official confirmation from CCP that this is real and hopefully not ending anytime soon; would love to see this go on for at least a month for them to have time to clear out dead structures
---
2007 ded
---
That's a fine affirmation. Keep chanting it to yourself.
---
&gt;  zero). Which is less than the imperium, legacy, NCdot, etc. I only addressed Goons because they were mentioned.
---
I do. Actually. Play. Eve. 
---
I mean, often as not, as a Bitter Vet(tm), its just to adjust my buy and sell orders and change skills, but I do still occasionally undock and shoot at shit.
---
you mean with edited screenshots of conversations, eh why spin lets see what happens
---
Can't goons just hide in lowsec until it all blows over?
---
Peak communism brain in play
---
cos there's nothing there worth invading.
---
Have we seen that Triglavian weapons have any extra effect on drifters?
---
Have any structures with standup ECM had any effect in slowing them down?
---
Last time I wandered through Oueletta it was abandoned :(
---
I read it as a renewed source of harvester drones.
---
dont you guys just dock up when snuff enters local?
---
Just says invasion on the tin. Nothing said about exclusivity.
---
that would be a dream come true
---
Bitter, scared, *and* homophobic. Truly, we are less for your departure.
---
The "until" part is the key that changes everything.
---
Just wait till we all retire.
---
Yes! But only because CCP made the unfortunate decision to remove skill point loss, except for T3 cruisers.
---
That would result in Goons glassing the rest of the galaxy in a month which is the whole issue...
---
I mean it's possible that the Drifters and Triglavian's are known enemies to each other and that the drifters have noticed the Triglavian's creating a beach head in New Eden the Drifters have decided to do the same in response just in an area far enough way that they don't have to have a direct conflict before they are prepared.  
---
The Drifters invaded New Eden years ago and have just been bidding their time and looking for something and it's just quite possible the Triglavian threat is exactly what they were looking for.
---
I haven't played in almost two years now, but I was with a Goon Rental Corp(tm) who just kinda fucked off into WHs full time. Spent all my time in there. Then one day I go to check the exit and there's this Tyrannis NPC guy and six other mother fuckers just sitting there staring at me. I can't remember, but were those dudes Drifters? Did they just roam around WHs?
---
Shut it down goy
---
&gt;These things DD supers in 2 shots.
---
"These things" that have appeared in null aren't the ones with DD's.  (At least so far).
---
Also, you should fit some tank on your super.
---
Also, you can easily kill them with a carrier.  Much less a super.
---
Yeah, the overreactions are very knee-jerk honestly
---
And hatch a revenge plan and start a bloc war then publish a revengepost.

---
feel free to check out the dual prop and transversal videos. good for small ships. I wouldn't bother with the other stuff yet.
---
This will result in the old problem Eve had before you could remap attributes. New players don't know enough about the game to make the right decisions about ships and weapons, just as it used to be ridiculous to expect new players to know what race and class to pick to get the best attributes for the role they wanted to take on in game.
---
Sounds good to me lmao

Visit fucking where? .. does it say Hevrice?

still, great poster +1 :)

The community is fine, it's the developer team that is shit
---
awww man i should have used that!!!
---
yeah 25m sp is plenty for assault frigs, t1 frigs, t1 destros or t1 cruisers and battlecruisers and exploration is not sp heavy at all with 1 or 2 mil in it you ll be good to go. I'd focus either on missiles or gunnery at the start and some basic ability to field drones (t2 lights for example). Missiles are easier to use correctly. Pick some elite pvper's like suitonia, jebi or tomalak, ibeast and watch their streams or videos, copy their fits if you can't fit something due to skill try to downgrade/upgrade some modules,  and pay attention to the ranges they keep, the orbit they pick and what type of ship they engage and at what speed they fly and at what speed have their opponents do.
---
Eve north was fucking incredible.  
---
And you can tell that this is correct because eve itself would be in the middle.
---
You already posted this in 2017: https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7iuy92/video_unbreakable_vii_nightmaremachariel_pvp/

Yea we want the content, but we don't want to lose the players :)
---
Yo, I randomly ran into the WH fleet of them almost two years ago during my exploration time. I warped just off the WH and landed almost on top of that Tyrannos guy and six other big dick Drifters just sitting there. I didn't know what to do so I just sat. Then I left the way I had come.
---
you know what i retract my ree at you over the csm shit you're more level headed than i gave you credit for, for what its worth.
---
&gt;We can’t fight these as they have DDs
---
The ones that have appeared so far do not have DDs.  Those are on other drifters.
---
&gt;They can DD supers in 2 shots
---
You should fit some tank on your super.
---
They can be killed by a small fleet of cruiser-ish ships, or one carrier.
---
https://i.imgur.com/RZc7ix6.png

but what does the fox say?
---
Thr jove left years ago in there mother ships
---
Get Marauder.  Point at drifter and open fire.
---
I appreciate it, keep me in mind next year 😉
---
Wouldn't surprise me.
---
There was a time on EVE where everyone frowned  of the thought of doing PvE in a sandbox like this. 
---
Now it's suddenly the best thing that happened in years and people want more of it. 
---
With this, you can clearly see the game itself was beginning to decay and CCP took action and decided to do this, and propably expand it, to attract new blood and old EVE players who quitted a while back to get the numbers back up. 
---
This is fucking genial marketing from CCP. 
---
Thing is, what now?
---
Wouldn't surprise me
---
You don't have a super do you?
---
You're just flailing now dave, they're all in the same generally well connected regions, easily accessible. BUT GUYS IT TAKES SO LONG TO GET FROM FOUNTAIN TO DELVE TO PERIOD BASIS.  
---
Weak shit dave, stop being a pussy.
---
Tears? This seems pretty standard. Guy asks if anyone thinks it's bad. I said I think it's bad. Get downvoted. 
---
Not sure what else you would expect.
---
I just packed all my shit up and got the fuck out of null cos life there is so dull and now this. Genuinely torn between living a carefree life of high sec L4s and heading back no wait no I'm not. Fuck null sec.
---
Did someone say "prepare for the return of EWAR?!"   
---
You can't die to something that can't lock or hit you :)
---
&gt;  Long term, any human stamina wasted on non-pvp mechanics is a bad design in my book.
---
Lol, krabbing is literally a significant portion of eves requirement at this point bud, thats a lot of human stamina wasted on non pvp....
---
mittens breaking both arms jerking himself off, then whining ... nothing new
---
Go to systems with ice belts in them and hit up one of the local ice miners. I think the new agency thing allows you to search ice belt systems.    
---
And to answer your title: the Porpoise and Orca are faction industrials.
---
Fighting other players who also have ships they don't care much about gets boring fast.
---
This is nice because it goes after assets people actually want to protect.
---
Ok then for you: They have to many to do anything.
---
This is reddit! Shoo! Back! Back! Get back in your eve-o forums home! 
---
Quick! Somebody toss a rude post as bait! We must contain the wild ISD!
---
This isn't happening! Aaaahhhhh!!    /s
---
Not if you catch them unprepared
---
If you cant defend all those structures maybe you should cut back a little? NC didn't seem to have all that much issue cutting losses on territory they couldn't hold.
---

I've been waiting for the day they start jumping connections and moving through chains.
---
IIRC, Drifters are Ancient Enemy Azdaja and Sansha are Corrupted Nardonya.
---
Who said you had to go after ships they don't care about?  150 bil can build a nice dread cache.
---
\*yawn\*
---
from the person that's literally just throwing insults instead of actually discussing the topic?
---
Wormholes are also safe.
---
&lt;3
---
You really need your whole super forces in order to handle some NPCs??
---
Good krabbing design is a content driver, forcing people to be undocked for long periods of time in order to generate spontaneous content.  These drifters (if you catch them fast enough) can really only be killed by citadel guns, supercarriers in cit tether range, or fleets of disposable destroyers. 
---
None of those are really suitable for showing up and fighting, and even if they were, they're only out for a few minutes, much too short to generate any sort of fight.  While rorqual balance definitely needs some tweaking, the mechanic of tethering a ship to a PVE grid in order to be forced into a fight is a really good design in my mind.
---
It was propably an athanor firing it's mining laser at the moon. You can extract ore from moons and mine it this way. It's a really nice looking animation.
---
Indes you just witnessed how stations begin to tractor a chunk out of a moon wich later will be Split in smaller Asteroids wich can be mined
---
&gt; The bottom up model provides for all of this, and more, and we are just 1 corp in GSF.
---
You seem to underestimate the economical wittyness of aryth, yes there is more (in Nullsec-Empires) crumbs for the linemebers. But who do you think is getting ALL the moongoo you mine and has built the biggest ever monopoly in EVE on reactions, fare more oppressive than OTEC or "Kings-of-Lowsec" ever have been. I mean he has to, he lives from that, but its not healthy now because it is your monopoly, I could find loads of archived posts of goons crying about PL having all lowsec moons.
---
It's a Tatara, but cool glad to know I wasn't about to get blasted out of the sky lol.
---
Well... It's Eve... You never know that I guess
---
This is what I was wondering. I left eve a few years ago because these massive alliances and corps were making it stagnant and so so so boring. I pine for the days of moo blockades and curse alliance. Those were fun days.
---
Please
---
Eh, us aussies should be waking up in about 6 hours. Or 12, depending on our friday night hangovers.
---
Yes, I have found the in-game community is nicer than the Reddit community so far.  Help chat and corp chat is helpful.  The only rude people I have met in-game are the people who spam duel requests to me.  I  eventually found the option to disable duel requests.
---
Love it.
---
Let’s see ... proper response ...
---
Get gud.
---
The NPCs are not ruining THE game ...
---
I just moved back into Null and am excited like a dog being let out for a pee that I may lose everything.
---
The refinery fractures a chunk of the moon its orbitting on. Then miners gather to strip the created rocks.
---
The game needs this
---
&gt;whats next, sansha developing new tech that destroys local and stops asset safety
---
CCPLEASE
---
The last thing we need is even more empty space, I doubt CCP would direct their efforts in that direction.
---
we will get started with it immediately
---
Correct evalueation

I can't bother to watch that bullshit.

Drifters get the best ships, the best weapons, and even the best VOICES!!! I'm jelly.
---
wo what?
---
Trigs are from a different dimension?
---
Explo cepter wont do bugger all dps so its not a big deal, scram ab bomber will have all the time in the world to kill them.
---
 when the community is too young to get the reference of your shitpost :smith:
---
VETO REFORMING IN SYNDICATE CONFIRMED????
---
Yeah, I've been thinking the same thing.  Triglavian propaganda months in advance, video trailers for the expansion, billboards hacked with easter eggs, test server mechanics playable, full patch notes regarding the Triglavian invasion, systems marked, clear win conditions.  Drifters... nothing.
---
I thought that until CCP linked the PCGamer article and quoted the part about no clues being given.  So... there must have been something that we missed? I guess?  I mean, my gut says that if you want to tell a story and your players don't pick up the clues, you're just a bad storyteller.  But, whatever.
---
Nothing new? More hard evidence of supers in Provi need.
---
Which book is this?
---
To be honest we mostly just reship there, but roam around and you'll find a frostian looking for a fight for sure.
---
Wormhole pancakes best pancakes.
---
It’s great right? Then that chunk is gonna get pulled to the station over 7-30 days then get shot again and blown into a harvestable asteroid field!
---
Check my post history for a really cool shot of the chunk getting lifted, that chunk was special, it represented a return to operations after a month long attempted eviction/harassment of our wormhole system.
---
I thought lowsec was ded?
---
Even TEST isnt autistic enough to withstand the pain of nonstop ops to rep/defend the countless timers npcs will create for their rental empire.  
---
Looks like SkillU had some inside knowledge... lol
---
Made me laugh out loud

One was sent to CODE to buy a flying permit, guess your bosses failed to pay

oh man, its great to see a member of the group that developed the 'blue balls no fun for my enemy' strategy crying when its used against him
---
Why is he talking about a product with less content than EVE?
---
They don't need to kill the structures, they just need to RF the damn Cyno Jammers
---
You caught me, I'm the Mittani
---
This post brought to you by Cocaine.

TEST already blued the Drifters.

Dude, that's legit beautiful. Well done on the screen cap.

I had seen a few legitimate whining posts like this so I took the opportunity ))

As I said, retarded.

That’s great thanks!!

Dave you are too stupid to discuss this with, I've literally tried and you're just too dense to accept that you've committed a tactical error.  In your mind everything you guys do is right, only in this case it wasn't, and its just too much for your tiny pea sized spod brain to handle sweetie.
---
You must be a Faux News viewer
---
Sure, sure.
---
Cope.
---
I tend to think the more chaos in eve the better the experience.  I hope this drifter shit gets out of control. The last eviction of a superpower took Lenny and others shelling out trillions of isk for people to find the motivation to do the deed.  Goons are trying now but only after farming such an advantage that they are unchallenged. The players have become so conditioned to being risk adverse.  Image and failure avoidance stops most ideas in there tracks. I get shoveled a lot shit for some of the things I've done. The MTO keepstar kill for instance.  Most would have never attempted to contest a force with a superior supercap fleet and pilots in better ships. In my mind I thought "this is gonna look like shit on the killboard"  but I can get it done regardless of the superiority we're facing.  Most people I talk to that participated in the event all say it was some of the most fun they have had in EVE.  It was a proper fight with a clear objective and damned be the killboard or what people thought.
---
they are pretty on top of it when they planned it ;-)

Don't forge,u never quite eve

I joined SteamWorks, saw an ad and chatted to them on discord about wanting to be a tackle flyer etc and they welcomed me in.

like, ok dude.
---
lol what?
---
That's a clear misconception about small lowsec pirate groups, most of us don't dock up against anyone... we just warp away and go some place else when the enemy decides to drop capitals or supers on us, because we are looking for good fights, not just feeding blobs.
---
And to be fair, even is Snuff as an entity has some kind of "null mentality" and is willing to drop shit tons of titans to achieve their objectives (or just for the lulz), most of their members are still lowsec pirates, and I've had amazing 1v1s against some of them.
---
I quoted where I got that from. Your statement.

Yea I read they got bought out and fired people or something, hopefully the new breed step up because a lot of people I’ve spoken to are nostalgic to how the relationship between CCP and the players used to be.
---
Only a gate as far as I can find and that's wholy different than a citadel.
---
Don't care about tether? I'd heard about the rest, but not ignoring tether.
---
same idea, the enemy doesn't get any kind of indication of the drifter initial fleet, undock dreads, kill in 5 minutes, tether back up on the cit and dock.  No opportunity for content.
---
A fine whine or a fine wine?
---
They were guristas affiliated RP-ers if i remember right. :)

https://mobile.twitter.com/TheMittani/status/1144353402186604550 here is the full rant
---
\&gt; A bit paradox, hmm?  
---
You seem to be new to reddit :P
---
Anyway, I'm just here to post about Brave Collective. Tl;dr: Our motto is stay classy and we try to maximize your fun per hour.
---
Our primary english speaking newbro friendly corp is Brave Newbies Inc. ([https://evewho.com/corp/Brave+Newbies+Inc](https://evewho.com/corp/Brave+Newbies+Inc).) which operates in nullsec, we are part of the Legacy Coalition which means be take part in both large scale fight but also do small gang pvp. We offer classes, free stuff and ton of fun, but as op said we are part of a bloc so there are some limitations on who we can engage (not that this is something a new player would have to worry about). If you want to learn more, have a look at our [wiki](https://wiki.bravecollective.com/) or our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7h9KiAtmO6Dkl2IK-cCvw). What I feel needs to be mentioned though is that we offer a lot of ressources and possibilities to advance and we try to help you, but what you do with it is entirely up to you, we won't convince to play this game.
---
We do have an also english speaking newbro friendly wormhole corp called [Spoopy Newbies](https://evewho.com/corp/Spoopy+Newbies), but I don't think I'm qualified enough to talk about the secret wh sex parties they do (they're doing an eviction right now, so sounds pretty fun though).
---
You can check out all of our (other) corps on our wiki: [https://wiki.bravecollective.com/public/alliance/about](https://wiki.bravecollective.com/public/alliance/about) (Btw, if you're looking for a hungarian null corp check out [The 1st Regiment](https://evewho.com/corp/The+1st+Regiment))
---
And now to play the R/eve drinking game. 
---
Take a drink everytime a goon flair responds
---
If a wild mittens appears, drink the whole bottle.
---
Yeah I’ve joined the channel Bringing Solo Back and a ton of people immediately helped me improve my slasher fit, my next death went much...better if that makes sense. I’ll check out those other two, thanks man!
---
Oh noes! Rats are shooting back! The horror!
---
Not when they are reinforced. You cannot scan them.
---
10yrs ago if you had walked into our gatecamp and the money was taken, you would not have been blown up, you would have been guided to hisec.
---
There are still a few corps who honor 1;1's and ransoms in today's eve. :)
---
Not once in 6 years have I lost a ship to a bug and you have lost numerous? I think you mistake a bug for incompetence.
---
Welcome to the fray, little sociopath &lt;3
---
Yes, and I don't super rat, and it is logged off space in space somewhere.
---
Good luck! Also, an underappreciated tackle ship is the Garmur, especially for kite-based roams where you can also be anti-support (shooting other frigates/destroyers). But it’s most useful if you have the racial skills to V, can afford faction disruptor and scram and deadspace MWD, and know how to maintain transversal. It’s very deadly.
---
Thanks my dude!
---
Rifter ..... it's emblematic for EVE, but it's a very bad ship atm.
---
Breacher and Slasher are far far better.
---
Breacher is OP in tank department, can do all sorts of setups, while Slasher properly fitted is a t1 interceptor, impossible to neut in close orbit (due to the cap reduction bonus on enduring scrams/webbs).
---
Yes. The correct place, it seems, is Providence.
---
TBC
---
It's one of your big4 but I would feel remiss if I didn't plug for Brave Newbies. Still out here, having fun, being brave, and staying classy!
---
We're living in Catch/Impass and have more to offer than ever. We have corps, sigs, and groups for just about everything you cpuld want to do in game. The Brave Dojo is there to help woth handouts of ships, skills, implants, pi setups, and of course knowledge! We even have a hungarian speaking Corp now! Still a great place to have fun and learn the game out in null
---
Yeah, hevrice
---
I might play again just for that action,haha. Even if I'm not good at it, better than nothing.
---
Hmm, I saw one of those on overview but didn’t Show Info on it, I’ll check it out thanks! I have a lot of skill training still to do though )
---
After all, if anyone was complaining about it being superblobby and stale, shaking up the meta will force new ways of playing.
---
Eve Uni has Campuses all over eve hi/low/00 and wh 
---
And if u like the web site consider joining them, they will teach u all u need to know and much more, one day u will graduate and have the knowledge to do what ever u want to do and having at least moderate knowledge about it.
---
FS and one day we will trade ammunition and explosions
---
No1 there - &gt; safe
---
Hs is the scariest ;_;
---
Bravo
---
&gt;f the Imperium chooses to over exploit a region like delve, they will face a rapid diminishing returns and other regions will increase in value as the stockpiles of minerals get out of balance.
---
Oh hai there, welcome to the Hive Fleet concept. We'll come and mine \*your\* minerals, and unless you feel like contesting 300 titans and 900 supercarriers, you'll sit there and let us.
---
I just started up last night, giving me amazing flashbacks to Trade Wars 2002.  So happy to be finally diving in!!!!!  
---
What are good videos to watch for beginners? Best place to get advice?
---
A click baity switcharoo.  You'll fit in nicely.
---
&gt;They used to. Now I'm not sure.
---
Set course J5A and find out.
---
Oh I haven’t even looked at Breacher, but I think the Slasher is going to be a favourite of mine! I’ve got a tackle setup for gang fights and one for 1 v 1, the people in bring back solo channel helped me with them.
---
oh now im fhine.
---
Also why does rote hate me. idgi. :(
---
&gt;Force them to live off 3 or 4 regions alone and split their supers accordingly. 
---
Why would we do that when it would be much more profitable to gunmine W-space?
---
Well if that means we win sov we'll start killing each other in like 2 weeks because peacetime test
---
It is friday night.
---
Basically forums and sub reddits say that but if you actually get in game you will encounter on of the most helpful communities in an mmo!
---
Rogue drone invasion of lowsec Inc.
---
r/eve is pretty toxic towards the game and are very negative
---
I’ve been going to the Eve Uni website and just searching YouTube for every eve video I can find. And everyone in chat is v helpful.
---
ITT we learn that the largest coalition in the game is unable to chew bubble gum and walk at the same time.   The idea that one of the myriad of sigs goons have couldn't have been tasked with defending against drifters.
---
You make your statement based around a notion that you *have* to play that way.
---
If you are choosing to play that way then that's on you. Adapt or die works in all instances. Taking engagements where you need to welp 60 dreads or multiple billions per ship is on you and your leadership. No one is against a good fight and taking a punch on the nose, but we don't see the need to be in a position where it has to be a bloodbath consistently. And we don't seek that flavor of content either.
---
I think SRP isn't inherently bad, but it's flogged as some sort of necessity based on a false idea that it's a necessity to have a bloodbath that is untenable for the line member as your main form of content.
---
Haha cheers.
---
I'm glad we could teach you something.
---
Yea man that’s what I’m finding, but I feel EVE’s players are especially cool and helpful, even if they’ve just killed me.
---
Why do you read 90% of the posts on this sub then lmao
---
@everyone 60 MAN SNUFF FLEET, STAND DOWN
---
any chance of using a font that’s at least semi-readable?
---
Yeah dunno why you're downvoted lol.
---
I don't watch any news programme.  They're all pushing narratives.  I prefer to think for myself and only care to know about things I can actually change.
---
I want the drifters to fuck up everything. Be a force that just fucks shit up at random. They see a large force of supers in one spot? They drop in to fuck it up etc. would help prevent cancer blobbing that the game is now.
---
We know new bros are great for the game! Plus we know its not easy to learn. We got help also back in the day and its kinda like: pay it forward!
---
" The only reason CCP isn't saying anything is probably because the coders  are to busy trying to figure out where the code has gone wonky in the  AI script, and apologize after an emergency patch fixing it"
---
Or CCP finally said fuck it and decided to start burning null. Lets hope the drifters escalate even more.
---
Like anyone in Stay Frosty gives a fuck about Discord pings xD
---
Keep trying nullbear, this is hilarious.
---
For Nullsec is was the worst day of their lives. For Wormholers, it was Tuesday.
---
Cheers for notifying us all of your virtues
---
obligatory
---
༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ DRIFTERS TAKE MY ENERGY ༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ
---
Pretty much this, fuck that place.
---
I, for one, welcome our Drifter overlords.
---
Yes with Verone leading them. He is now CCP Falcon.
---
This wont change shit.
---
dae wormholes scary and hard??
---
tl;dr
---
Now the title was enough though. Eve has been dying since been dying since been dying since been dying. Thanks for a post we have never seen before. Also our toxic community helps keep offended snowflakes herded up like cattle for our own amusement.
---
Madoka is all
---
So long as I hear that
---
1. EVE is dying, and
---
2. EVE players are assholes
---
I know we’re safe.
---
EVE has been dying for over 10 years now. What I find interesting is the number of people here who say one of two things: “I’m a returning EVE player, I was with \[crew name\], are we still in \[system name\]? If so, can I get my stuff out of there?” or “EVE is whatever.the.number.in.years.it.is.that.year years old. Is it too late for me to join?"
---
EVE has an amazing appeal, its developers are some of the coolest people I’ve ever met \[except CCP Chair, I met him at Fanfest, didn’t say a great deal of anything\]. Some times you doubt their decisions.
---
What you don’t doubt is the fan-tas-tic player community they have, because they are, by a very wide margin: the most talented, the most dedicated, the biggest drinkers of alcohol \[they are known for cleaning out bars of their entire alcohol supply: *everything\]* and they are responsible for some of the greatest conversations I’ve had in gaming: players with amazing careers, devs with an almost religious dedication to the game, actual scientists, Playboy Playmates. You can’t think of a point of view I’ve talked to someone who had it at Fanfest. Even the then president of Iceland has delivered a speech to the EVE Online player base, EVE is that important to the local economy.
---
So, you should definitely stick around until you’ve met every asshole in the game.
---
AND
---
**never give a rotten ISK to CODE for -any- reason.**
---
Getting my "reeee" on....can the team correct the voice actor's pronunciation of "nullsec" for future videos? I've never heard anyone emphasis the second syllable (nullSEC). The first syllable gets the stress (NULLsec).
---
I’m generally not sure if you’re being sarcastic or not )
---
Yes, retarded.
---
It is, there's not a soul around, safest place on EVE.
---
Just pack the ship of your choosing, bling it up and go there to run combat anoms, do exploration or even mine; all on you own, totally inhabited. In fact, it is so safe you can even close local chat and forget about smashing D-Scan. Perfectly safe.
---
Awesome attitude in what seems like such a competitive game.
---
Bait posting is an important skill
---
It's a 15 year old game. People ask for too much
---
If they really go through with it, I for sure would start playing EVE. I like devs wtih balls who aren't afraid of trying new things for the sake of innovation and fun. Currently looking for new game to start playing and EVE looks amazing, but I'm afraid it would be hard for me to start with all those veterans around who were amassing wealth for last 50 years, can't rly compete with that.
---
You mean apart from those multiple hisec and nullsec incursion groups?
---
And so a new era of degradation and Eve Online become a fantasy-themed game on a planets?
---
Should probably use a banana for scale dude!
---
I mean, considering that I've had my cit reinforced by drifters twice in 2018...
---
It is retarded to resort to such transparent copes, I agree.
---
Wow. This is Some shitposting.
---
Summary is that the main purpose of really big ships is to deter people from doing something that might cause them to undock.
---
daddy tyrannos don't let mr sansha near me ! i want to be your slave only !
---
You have it backwards. The *crumbs* get pushed up. The wealth begins with the linemembers.
---
Why is this so hard for you to understand? Your mentality is why GSF and TEST are crushing everyone else with regard to income and production. These groups literally empower the line to become stinking assed rich, instead of the alliance getting it all and sprinkling some back down on the linemembers.
---
I understand what *you think* is happening. The problem is that you are wrong. It literally is a bottom up operation. 
---
When the players put in the work, and the ones at the bottom  become  multi-hundred-billionaires, the crumbs that get pushed up are very lucrative.
---
A lot of folks come out defending it here of course.  But i have to agree.  I've been a Eve lurker for a while.  Played in a corp or two.  Mostly came back to fly wormholes and make some isk playing in space flying my Tengu.  Just to get killed by people multi-boxing.  For no reason really.  Then trash talked into oblivion because what, I don't have 6 accounts i'm linking so I can troll people.  The game has no love for the single player.  It crushes them, people literally sit trying to barricade off content waiting to destroy you.  Makes it impossible to casually come back.
---
I first came to EVE after WOW/blizzard basically killed open world pvp
---
Oh shit, what if, Sansha invades wormhole space next?
---
So this finally became known? Hey V this is Mut.. I always knew it was you because of Falcon
---
No you misunderstand, you have an extra chromosome and somehow noone has told you this before so you think you're clever but in reality you're retarded.
---
If you tell triglavians stop putting loot on their ships and concord to stop paying us lp
---
We'll more than glad to let them do whatever they want
---
The absolute state of panfam when the greatest threat to the security of their foes comes from NPCs, despite a full Horde deployment to Delve at the start of this campaign.
---
TEST lost a jammer as well.  Cits haven't finished their hull ref timers yet, so no way to know for sure yet.
---
This is why I love EVE with a passion.
---
This is not some slow-thinker click fest.
---
The Drifter invasion is a new thing, it’s a big thing and some people are going to have to adapt, adjust and overcome.
---
You wanted content, you’re getting content, go for it!
---
&gt; Actually there are **many** small groups/communities on discord that out of  principle don't n+1 opponents, don't use caps and bet on quality over  quantity. 
---
If this were true then no one would ever complain about not finding "gudfites" here on r/Eve.
---
I call bullshit, unless by "many" you mean 2 or 3 groups of 2-3 people.
---
I dunno, am I?
---
Drifter blueball today. No drifter for all our armor timer
---
Well, two things:
---
1. Yes of course people will try to defend their armor timers. But suddenly they will have a lot more armor timers. The attacker does not have to form twice for a threat to put the services offline, but one single time. That means, much less preparation needed, and no sunk cost for the attackers to blueball a defending team.
---
1.b. Dropping supers on opportunistic whalers went wrong alot lately! If you have no fax support and other caps on standby, a few titans die fast... 
---
2. second VERY IMPORTANT change is TZ tanking is basically over now. As you HAVE to be able to defend, even in your (and your enemies) off-Timezone. This is a huge change of meta for attacking players too.
---
In general, yes the actual fights are not changed in any way. But the preparation, and surrounding circumstances for the fights, WILL change. This will be a change of meta, not a change of balance.
---
Can confirm. It's also where my Magnates go to die.
---
Trump is the least popular president in history. History may give the incumbent the edge but it doesnt provide much context. Wouldnt call it likely that he would win reelection.
---
I understand the thinking but it needs to move forward.
---
I’m not in null right now I can’t really gauge it, but shit is going down. My experience so far is that we have to adapt to the changing situation and find a way to overcome the problem. That’s the whole point.
---
Einstein-Rosen Brigade - C2 wormhole corp, I believe? They may have moved to higher class space, but they are always very newbie oriented.
---
Brand Newbros - TEST's newbie corp. A bit too spodbrained right now but I've been poaching them to pvp.
---
I know you are, but what am I?
---
Perhaps they were looking for a way into Triglavian space, and our space was the stepping stone?
---
lol mittens called that citadel bash fest a war.
---
So 1% great and 99% shit. A great epithet
---
Oh yea well Tatara is the bigger version of the Athanor. Workd the same but gibes different/better boni and of course more expensive :D
---
Spoiler Alert: You are just another face in the crowd. A nobody posting like a somebody.
---
If someone came, killed your ship you might paid real money for, looted your stuff and typed a &lt;3 in local
---
Will you still love them or hate them?
---
Just curious
---
That's a collection of miners, it's lowsex
---
Don't worry, you would've been included anyways as mentioned in op. :P The thing is, you are well known already and now the half of the comments is Brave. I want to know (more) about the smaller entities BECAUSE you are already so well known. No need to turn this into your recruitment thread. (You didn't, just sayin')
---
why do you think i live in nullsec?
---
Wait
---
God damn /u/Nabeev fucking slayed him
---
I’d still love them, but I’d probably want to kill them as well.
---
what though?
---
Ya but saying things have been through final timer is bit disingenuous when it was because the drifters were still in system through the entire timer. The trillion isk question is will they return for timers.
---
Redline isn't an elitist ? Whaaaat?
---
I am good without it, i find her irritating.
---
It's almost as if different people enjoy different things. Huh.
---
Bob liketh the salt...
---
Bob mineth of the salt, for it is all we truly mine.
---
Kinda sounds toxic, but... then wouldn't any pvp statement be defined as toxic the same way?
---
We have some real toxicity, but mostly there is a healthy grain of salt thrown at the concept in the name of true pvp.
---
Eve has been dying slowly since it was created, maybe :P or just changing....
---
Looks like an Adam Ellis comic
---
People IN eve have been incredibly friendly the past few months for me.
---
This sub on the other hand is full of people who wake up on the wrong side of the bed everyday just to find shit in their cereal.
---
CODE. Pilots aren't all that bad. I've found that mostly all of them thoroughly enjoy playing the game that they play. Their fun per-hour is through the roof. 
---
That said, if you're grading them purely to a single standard, they're currently All-time-ranked 21. As an alliance.
---
Perhaps... you could be *wrong?*
---
was my thinking exactly. I understand that losing what you played YEARS for is also something I would have to swallow for a few days probably... I accumulated a lot of assets over my time in Eve.
---
But the opportunities are so countless. Getting rid of a million old spagetthi code things and create new histories with new entities (there would surely be a majority of the current players also over there, but I can imagine some to vanish/disband and new entities coming to life) - I would play it and love it. But I would also cry about what had been lost. My corpse collection for example... :( But yeah, as a repeating player of outdated games I have experienced server shutdowns before († RIP BattleForge, long live skylords)
---
A retard.
---
Being friendly and respectful has always been a thing in this game, especially when you are ganking someone. Since at least 2008.
---
The shocker to me was going to dota after eve years ago... a genuine - wtf is wrong with everyone here moment.
---
The killmails I've seen have Apollo Tyrannos's weapon listed as Lux Kontos, I thought that was the name of the DD unless I'm missing something?
---
By many I mean I am involved in 2 groups and I am 100% sure these aren't the last 2 groups left in EVE doing micro/small gang stuff, but who knows maybe EVE is really dead and we are the last active pvpers right.
---
Reminder that one of the things being furiously rubbed ain't your hand...
---
You make my roomba look like a genius.
---
Oversized ab, yep. As an alpha at least. With max skills you can usually get away with just an oversized battery, but that can require fitting rigs as well.
---
Dude don't even play Eve. No one cares
---
Naive, gullible and up 1m SP :)
---
(Sorry you couldn't afford it, maybe next time)
---
Heh, emergent gameplay.

He isnt even playing, he is the ccp of nullsec
---
I'd totally be down for that, but good luck convincing CCP to ever do something like that.
---
Thank you all! You’re amazing! :-)
---
just because he dosent play the way you want him to play eve dosent mean he dosent play eve
---
How fucking dare you assume my gender! You cis pig! I identify as a drifter, you asshole!
---
Highsec pubbies were able to farm the Drifter incursions when they were a thing, even with 2 shield layers and DDs, but null blobs can't work it out?
---
Hint: throwing supers at it is not the optimal strategy in every situation. I know that goes against literally everything your leadership has told you for the past 3 years, but damn dude.
---
&gt;why is reddit attacking mittens, surely he is the most qualified to talk about the state of nullsec 
---
lol
---
Yeah Athanors are pathetic.
---
I don't think it is, otherwise this Kiki took two DD's to kill: [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77516372/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77516372/)
---
Just adapt.
---
would you care to contribute to the discussion and tell me why i am wrong?
---
You mean apart from thousands of people who make 300m an hour doing them in high sec?
---
welcome aboard soldier! get ready for some intense shaking and a lot of losses. try lowsec someday. best wishes o/
---
Awww..thx
---
&gt; full Horde deployment to Delve
---
Wait what? I know it's usually Goons who argue "it was just some SIGs", but in this case, I really can't remember Horde as an alliance deploying out of the North during last, what, 3-4 months?
---
Dont forget the 50 or so dinosuars!
---
idk, you like to push F1 and measure your success in the game by you wallet?
---
Ironic really.. that and karmafleet nubs commenting like they really have a clue.
---
Yes, i know that, i always found it funny how much he RP-ed. :)
---
Inconceivable
---
Sure are a lot of false flags lately.
---
thats a lot of assumptions you are making, would you mind sharing your evidence?
---
Nothing is stopping them from doing an EVE 2 while keeping EVE 1 in maintenance mode.

---
They all of them need given a fighter wing as it stands its debatable of the weapons could defend against a solo frig or t1 cruiser.
---
I stated that "I don't know" and ended the sentence with a "?", which means I was asking a question... what assumptions? Are you stupid?
---
So here's one problem I see...
---
Sure, he's got a lot of experience in the state of Null sec. But he's also heavily invested in the *current* state of Null sec. So when he says "this is terrible for business", it really just sounds like he's saying "this is terrible for MY business". Because it is. Shooting holes in all the big boys toys is going to offset the carefully constructed political balance that is Sov. But that's what the game needs. Even if that means a bunch of ~~hard core~~ care bears are going to cry when their sandcastles are knocked down.
---
ive yet to hear a valid response on why i am wrong, its as if reddit is full of bandwagoners without an understanding of what they are arguing about
---
Save the spot, then come back from time to time to see if the belt is there. Then you'll be able to ninja mine some expensive ore before the owners come back
---

I'm not sure why you would try to label them as a "CNN Viewer"as if had a derogatory connotation. That's something straight out of the playbook of alt-right Faux News parrots.
---
I totally agree, at this point I have only put weapons and stuff on an Astrahus.   The rest of my structures have no defences at all.   Though with the changes to the AI of NPC's I will have to change that.
---
Full control gang with links and a huginn against tech 1 cruisers and BC's, decent video and music was good. Post worthy? The jury is still out on that one.
---
Quit and play a new game? Maybe I can interest them in this new EVE2.0 thing. It's super new

Convocation of augmented human narodnya have now-time pressure to self-orient.

Nothing can halt the flow of Vyraj.  Conform or be extirpated.

this is just one more reason that low power citadels shouldn't have reinforce at all. un-stronted towers didn't have timers, neither should low-power stuff. asset safety is a big enough crutch already.

Overloaded you can push 180 DPS, 4k ehp.
---
Unfortunately the primary targets used to be ceptors, which are rarely used today in null. :(
---
Breacher otoh, can push 5.1k EHP with just MSE, or you can MASB it or even MASB+SAAR.
---
The power of the breacher comes in the flexibility of the damage, with EHP/tank and the range of it's weapons, as it can hit \~8k.

So you're asking for CCP to destroy everything people have spent years building, and you think that won't immediately kill the game? I'm 100% in favor of drifters burning shit down, but it has to be something you can fight back against, not some impossible enemy that you just have to run from. Otherwise, people are going to think "what's the point of playing this game when CCP is just gonna randomly decide to take away everything I've built?"
---
The enemy of my enemy is myself I thought.
---
Very nice fights and good piloting, consider using a tactical overlay.
---
It's just great today the biggest subset of whiners are the people who have been sitting pretty mostly unasailed for years in carved out alliance pockets.
---
Mittani bitching is just what happens when you take candy away from happy kids
---
If the krabs die what are we going to eat?
---
Keep this shit up and I’ll be logging into eve after a 5 years.
---
you're trying to argue that the biggest krabs in the game are going to be most negatively affected by yet more krabbing content.
---
just think about that for a moment, and understand why it doesn't make any sense.
---
That's good news, some very good players in those channels. :)
---
irrebuttable
---
My sleep deprived brain thought it said "have rice" lmao
---
He's so high on his own farts he thinks CCP is doing this *specifically* to him and the Goons? Jesus.
---
He's comparing this to the t20 incident? How gifted do you have to be to not understand that an employee giving a direct advantage to customers/players and an event happening *all over the game* are very different situations?
---
Big brained take: a huge event happening will *stop* media attention? An event on a scale that's never happened before in EVE will get the media to shy away from it because they're not paying attention to *you*? Get fucked.
---
He's spent so long in his ivory tower he has no idea what it's like to actually be a player; To actually participate in the game instead of having people gum his scrote to a shine-o-ball-o polish.
---
I can only imagine what CCP actually thinks of Mittens and his constant chest beating. Does he think that if he just tells people "NO MORE EVE WE DONE", everyone in his alliance is just going to up and quit? Leave a decade+ of work just because some dude is pissy?
---
There's nothing there to shoot
---
Buy a rorqual.
---
Most of the corps in Vastly Outnumbered take new bros or high sec pilots who want to take the next step into PvP and large scale Indy!
---
Holy shit lmao you are mad as fuck. It's just a game dude, it's not healthy to get this upset over it.
---
This is a good post. Also, selling 1k corpses in Jita, 2m each.
---
Tbh i think mittens isn't credible as he's retarded just like everyone who plays this game. I mean that in an equalitarian way, myself included.
---
&gt;Sure, he's got a lot of experience in the state of Null sec. But he's also heavily invested in the current state of Null sec. So when he says "this is terrible for business", it really just sounds like he's saying "this is terrible for MY business"
---
Surely because he has so much lose (as in he has built up the largest and most successful eve alliance) is only reinforcing my central point, the dude knows what works and if he says something is dumb related to nullsec then he knows whats up
---
&gt;shooting holes in all the big boys toys is going to offset the carefully constructed political balance that is Sov. But that's what the game needs. Even if that means a bunch of hard core care bears are going to cry when their sandcastles are knocked down.
---
thing is this invasion does not achieve anything, goons have defended their shit, the drifters are just a temporary speed bump, like there is no sandcastle being knocked, its just put nullsec on pause.
---
Actually i rather think it is; for example, goon csm and i suppose by and large the goonswarm felt it was annoying to have to form for interceptors entosing their space, ceptors cant toast... and then they felt it was annoying having to come out and repair the sov... now you dont need to as it does it on its own - guess they preffered having the time to mine and krab than defend the space they wanna live in and   
---
AND  
---
most recently being unable to deal with ''fozzieclaws'' led to the nerf across the whole combat ceptor class.. shortly after which goons attacked the norths sov..  
---
There are probably more examples of what could be viewed imo as nepharious use of the csm but cba... bit like most goons when it comes to having to defend their own space and actually risk something.
---
It shows.
---
I was actually asking.
---
I lived quite some time in NS and still have alts there, it sucks from my perspective. Do you like to form part of massive fleets where you just anchor and push F1? And/or are you there for the easy and secure isk-making? 
---
Those are seriously the only reasons I can come up with for someone wanting to live there. And don't get me wrong, unlike you I respect other playstyles, I have a lot friends there, some even in charge of corps in your coalition.
---
Why you heff to be mad?
---
give us drifter bpc 1 run
---
༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ DRIFTERS TAKE MY MEAT ༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ
---
if i build up the largest and most successful fast food chain, and then say a new law being passed is bad for fast food chains, does that mean im retarded for using my knowledge and experience?
---
Did you read the images are you just in here because you want to feel superior?
---
CCP will propably spam more drifters in Imperium space to give a proper answer to this tweet.
---
Only toxic to people who want to be turbo spoonfed.
---
Wake me up when the drifter panic is over and everyone stops freaking out that their precious game world is doing things that doesn't fit with their preferences.
---
How does this *shut down PVP*? As far as I know, you can still shoot other players. They didn't remove that feature, and you should probably slap whoever told you otherwise.
---
Because Dear Leader is acting as if CCP owes any player’s plans any consideration at all. “Oh what’s that Mittens? You want us to wait a week while you exfil? Sure, no problem, we’ll work around your schedule.” 
---
Adapt or die, right?
---
and crash node

༼ つ ◕ . ◕ ༽つ DRIFTERS TAKE MY MEAT ༼ つ ◕ . ◕ ༽つ
---
Except Mittani rants like this on Reddit right now too, no cherry picking needed to see that he's being a little bitch solely because EvE isn't the way he wants it.
---
It's made more embarassing by the fact that these whines are coming from the CEO of one of the most massive and powerful alliances out there who have been sitting in relative comfort for years. It really creates the perspective of a pissy child who's mad that "they won't play the game my way".
---
Haha tough shit, that's EvE! If you think you should be happy and comfortable in EvE always, then you do not understand the game
---
Where even is the majority of lowsec faction warfare happening?  I'll bring an alt out there and get shit on by ya'll.
---
Maybe it needs more PSSSSH!
---
your changing the subject but whatever, i like this conversation more
---
&gt; Do you like to form part of massive fleets where you just anchor and push F1? And/or are you there for the easy and secure isk-making?
---
attacking my content is subjective, if my content is bad then why do more people live in null than in lowsec?
---
I am in null because i like the content, i like being part of the narrative, crushing the evil and dirty casino money whores that are nc. the isk making isnt as much as what everyone says, its mostly propaganda.
---
&gt;Those are seriously the only reasons I can come up with for someone wanting to live there. And don't get me wrong, unlike you I respect other playstyles, I have a lot friends there, some even in charge of corps in your coalition.
---
where did i say i dont respect other playstyles?
---
Can confirm.
---
Lol "goon tears" as we steamroll and win at every turn. Yes, surely the goons are the ones crying LMAO
---
Rote doesn't hate you. Rote nothings you.
---
Jesus was a jew, please stop all this bullshit "interpretation".
---
Honestly, if Eve comes to a crashing end because an NPC invasion led to mass rage quits across NS I would happily laugh my ass off into a new gaming addiction.
---
Burn it all down, fuck yeah
---
I think he is saying the enemy should be difficult, but rather for CCP to shoot for the stars in difficulty level. Its one thing the game has been lacking a lot of in recent times, and part of why I unsubbed for a few years, just coming back recently. There has been a sever imbalance in the risk vs. reward structure in Eve. 
---
I think he is hoping CCP keeps the drifters a constant serious challenge in K-Space. Don't just turn them into another thing to farm for isk. If thats not what he is thinking, that's at least what I would like to see.
---
Mittani is a mong
---
Can confirm, I afk mined in my Orca for hours in lowsec without checking the client at all.
---
your missing a vital point my friend.
---
this whole thing is not permanent, the only way it affects goons is putting our affairs on a short pause, we arent losing anything, its just a temporary event that makes eve even more stale as everyone is stuck at home shooting npcs
---
&gt;Adapt or die, right? If you’re whining instead of figuring out a solution to the situation you find yourself in, you’re the pubbie.
---
we have adapted, we havent lost anything major, and we are unifying citadel fits, we have a solution and its working fine, it just makes all of eve pause
---
Probably each other.
---
So the "elite pvp" coalition just got steamrolled into dust by a bunch of angry krabs? Wow that's embarrassing.
---
the solution was found - it was to stop engaging in pvp content. adapting isn't the problem that's easy, but doing so is hardly a benefit to the game in this situation, is it?
---
I don't think anyone hates you. More confused why you rager quit our discord?
---
Well, I think a couple of guys are a little upset when you tried putting an alt into rote too... 
---
 R.I.P thesenate
---
the point is to take on new challenges and to adapt to what they throw at us. If EVE dies because CCP does nothing and nothing changes; what's the good all that shit you 'built' anyways if there's no game to play at all? Basically what you want is to be able to 'fight back' so as to keep things the same; fuck that.
---
Yes, I'd love to see for an extended time, but limited, the drifters steam roll through nullsec. Maybe CCP releases some new tech that allows us to defeat them in the future, idk. But something major needs to change. In my opinion, the whole point of something like this is to shake up everything; it would be so epic.
---
Shitposting is an art form; when you get good at it, you'll rake in the salt (and toxicity) like you rake in the ISKs.  
---
It's just another layer of gaming, though; despite all the salt here and everywhere, we still meet up in Iceland and Vegas and at other community events, and drink and party together.
---
I really don't think you'd enjoy that at all. I, on the other hand, would enjoy it immensely; which might explain why I spend so much time indoctrinating our newbees.
---
Until last week it was goons in Null, Snuff in Low and Code/Pirate in High.
---
What's your problem?
---
He lives in your head rent free my man
---
Wait, I didn't change the subject... or at least not intentionally, you make so little sense this is gettimg confusing. Please do state what it is that you want me to answer directly and I'll do so.
---
And to answer you questions:
---
1. I wasn't attacking your content, I just don't personally enjoy it. And I didn't even think about your "narrative" argument, good for you I guess.
---
And the isk IS much better, my money making alt is in your alliance.
---
2. You didn't, just made wild assumptions of cowardice based on you experience as a nullsec carebear; which is of course completely wrong.
---
So, say this plays out like he says, and it turns into forced PvE, are you going to be 100% on board with that?
---
So if trigs are invading high and drifters burning null. Does this mean they meet in low and make it a war zone?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyHMDC8PfPc
---
the really interesting story that would unfold is how the players deal with a new map and a completely redrawn world. How does the economy work when certain things become increasingly scarce etc etc. The drifters are just a means to throw the PVP world into complete chaos, which would be awesome.
---
http://evelostfound.blogspot.com/2016/01/sansha-wormholes-for-pve-and-pvp.html
---
Technically they already have a couple of wormholes
---
Yo, welcome bro. I already like you.
---
Most good stories have an antagonist.  Mittens is among the best antagonists in Eve's history.
---
For some reason this meme cracked me up more than the others lmao
---
I haven't run out of arguments, you haven't refuted any of them in any substantive way that makes any sense in the game environment and so now im just hurlinig insults at your stupid ass.
---
The real salt is always in the comments section
---
i heard haras is a dead end ;)
---
Okay. Glad you got that off your chest. Now go away, please.
---
*Acts surprised that maybe leaving some people to defend is a good idea, and it's actually a thing now*

you have, you ran out when i pointed out that groups will have more than 1 structure in more than 1 location.

---
Losec is chalk full of people and action
---
Would be awesome if they opened the A821-A region, cuz that's where the drifter headquarters are after all. The station even has a LP store. And with said LP, let us buy drifter ships ?
---
The region would be hellcamped all day, but it would be fun.
---
Yea, but who is he? I've seen a couple posts about him whining lately, just wondering why anyone should care what he thinks.
---
being 'good' in a single facet of the game doesn't necessarily mean your ideas are good.
---
Gold for you
---
It might be bad for your business, but still be the right thing to do.
---
I’d rather see TEST failcascade and the game last 10 years extra than have TEST completely dominate and the game die that much sooner.
---
Praise be to Apollos!
---
that's what they want you to think.
---
Hey, there's people looking to have T1 ships that instablap capitals, we can only hope and wait for some TV content.
---
Your post should be set on fire

EVE has been dying since 2004.
---
I enjoy Korean Jesus

Noone cares, just move on buddy.
---
Don't be afraid, everybody has a place in New Eden, just log in and start flying with us and you will understand something in five years but the important thing is eve will amaze you more than anything!
---
If I had to choose between a packed j space and an empty one, I'll to empty
---
Why not both? All we need is a single reinforcement cycle for full power structures of max 2 days and no reinforcement for low power structures.
---
I think the proving may be more from individual/corporate standings with drifters/triglavians bases on how your respond to them.  There has to be something to bump standings for Triglavians...has anyone fighting the invasion seen any kind of bump?
---
I still have yet to see any of this "goon salt". We're literally the ones that are least affected by this. Mittens is definitely unhappy but I have yet to see a single other person complain. People are hyped for new lore content, no matter how hard you try and spin it.
---
I'd rather CCP do their job.
---
Let’s get this straight: Snuff Guy double crosses mittens. Mittens loses his shit; instead of doing anything about to Snuff, he invaded the north because **HE KNOWS WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON IN THIS GAME**
---
He’s prolly as disconnected to politics and nullsec as much as Hilmar is to eve
---
&gt;Please do state what it is that you want me to answer directly and I'll do so.
---
"you like to push F1 and measure your success in the game by you wallet?"
---
my question was why are you assuming this about me
---
&gt;I wasn't attacking your content, I just don't personally enjoy it. And I didn't even think about your "narrative" argument, good for you I guess.
---
you were attacking my content, "I lived quite some time in NS and still have alts there, it sucks from my perspective.", 
---
&gt;and the isk IS much better, my money making alt is in your alliance.
---
dude you can make so much more, in lowsec if you know what you are doing and without taxes haha
---
&gt;You didn't, just made wild assumptions of cowardice based on you experience as a nullsec carebear; which is of course completely wrong.
---
you said that i dont respect other playstyles (your quote:"unlike you I respect other playstyles") and now you say i do respect other playstyles ("You didn't"), please apologise for being wrong on this point
---
Risky click based on the subreddit name. I'm expecting R34 spreadsheets.
---
What's the lore behind the Sansha and J-space?
---
Noooooooooooo!
---
Don't stop, let it burn!
---
I think the point of drifters burning everything would be to shake up everything; especially PVP and sov. Clearly the people playing the game can't keep it interesting; so why not let some crazy UI NPC shake it up.
---
Wake the fuck up pilot, we got a galaxy to burn.
---
People asked if it was a bug or not. That's "salt" now? Yikes, desperation my man.
---
your absolutely correct, however being good at a particular thing does mean that your opinions (its not a idea) on that particular thing are valid and good.
---
Sometimes doing their job involves nerfing dominant playstyles.
---
They are just getting into the regular bashing chore capsuleers have to do everyday, give them more time to learn
---
Ok, now I just hope you are trying to troll me, because otherwise you are way more stupid than I tought.
---
Anyway, good luck buddy, you bored me.
---
And this has what to do with players pulling their punches for "the health of the game"?
---
But muh blue donuht...pttttth.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I came back to eve because the queue times in Team Fight Tactics were 3+ hours long.
---
I resubbed for a month because of the Triglavians.
---
The Drifters just might make me buy a lifetime sub.
---
“No player is going to put the "health of the game" over their own survival or interest. Not a single one. Pretending otherwise is a cope.”
---
This was your statement. I’m telling you this is a false statement, and telling you why it’s false.
---
The difference between us is that my Zkill IS my tombstone
---
im not arguing morals though (however morally speaking burning all of null is good (even though these drifters arent doing that))
---
i am arguing facts, and if i argue something is bad for my business then it is bad for my business, thats my entire point, mittens opinions are valid and correct because he is the expert in this specific example.
---
That's a different ISD team you are confusing me with. ISD:CCL are the ones you'll find on the EVE forums, ISD:NEC mainly operates on writing fiction and lore for EVE.
---
Affirmation of Convocation of Triglav Outside the Struggle.  Noema of poshlost extirpation of Ancient Enemy Azdaja in advancing-time is absolute imperative.  Augmented human narodnya may prove themselves fit and receive glorification.
---
Convocation of Triglav Outside the Struggle remains consent-locked on the noema of poshlost against the noema of sobornost with deviant automata.  Advancing-time noema of sobornost invoked with acceptable material realization by Paramount Technical Troika of Veles Clade in contradiction of repeated-time observation of mortification of claim-holdings of Svarog Clade.
---
You guys are trying so hard to spin this as "goons are salty", but literally every goon I've seen besides mittens is hyped for this. If you think we're going to lose any citadels to npcs you're delusional, though to be fair they've put up much more of a fight than NCPL did.
---
Well gotta portray the narrative. But the point that the mittani has been taking issue with is that  unannounced pve has interrupted player wars because we dont know enough about the mechanics in play right now to know if ignoring them would be crippling. It'll get sorted out in due time but it is kinda strange for this to just drop out of nowhere. Personally I'm excited to see where it goes, i like the drifters and have wanted to see them do a little more since i started this game.
---
No dave, they're not that far apart, they weren't ALL being hit, and you have a weeks worth of timers dipshit
---
Yeah, you're not making any damn sense.
---
Me: "you can't expect players to give in or pull their punches for the sake of the video game"
---
You: "CCP may need to nerf you"
---
??????
---
We literally already figured out their AI. They aren't a threat to anyone except dumbasses gating their supers around.
---
Nword don't tell me what to do.
---
Rent free
---
I’m providing you an example of my reasoning for putting the health of the game over my alliance’s interests. I would rather see the game last longer at the cost of my alliance. At no point did I mention ‘you.’ I’ve been referring to TEST this entire time.
---
You chose to instead interpret the word TEST as Goons, and I am uncertain why. It’s pretty explicit which alliance I’m in.

---
you're going to need glasses for the level of short sightedness you're displaying here, grath.
---
you are using ad hominem and not even trying to argue my main point, i will spell it out for you,
---
1. mittens has built the most successful nullsec entity-FACT
---
2.because of point 1 we know that what mittens does and knows is correct
---
3.because of this, his opinions based on his knowledge and experience are more valuable than anything else
---
&gt;He’s prolly as disconnected to politics and nullsec as much as Hilmar is to eve
---
if this is true (which it is not) then how come imperium is the most succesful entity in eve, does it mean that all the rest who are beneath the imperium (panfam.legacy,winter and dead co) are even more disconnected to politics and nullsec than mittens and hilmar?
---
I was talking to a Corpmate about this last night. People bitching about pve in their pvp sandbox. 
---
How do the goons make their money? Honestly? AFAIK the only real way isk comes into the game is through faucets like NPC kills, which people are forced to do in some capacity. 
---
So some NPCs good some npcs bad, but my choice is completely arbitrary so long as it doesnt affect my gameplay
---
you lose, good day, my iq is higher than urs

So who else is disappointed?

It's weird that you would either assume I can't afford it, or otherwise use money in an attempt to make me feel bad.  I'm curious what that says about you?

but that's not a free kill, so they won't do that.
---
No joke? 
---
I'm a collector and I'll buy quite a few
---
Null sec entities are just mad because they can’t convo the drifter’s diplo for blue standings.
---
^ translates to: "oh shit his points and arguments are valid, because i want to cover up my intellectual defeat i shall tell my opponent to suck someones dick"

&gt; Some will quit, but a lot will re-sub, and many more will finally give EVE a try.
---
Unsubbed two years ago. Have been a player since beta and did take one 4 year break before as well.

&gt;Sometimes doing their job involves nerfing dominant playstyles.
---
You said this in response to me saying "CCP should do their job." That's a threat against our playstyle, which is dominant. (And TEST's, I suppose.) It's a complete non-sequitur to the conversation of "players should not be relied upon to pull their punches for the sake of the 'health' of a video game." This has absolutely nothing to do with the entire conversation, and feels more like a kneejerk emotional response than a relevant argument.
---
I get that you need to publicly buy into the cope here, and that's fine. I wasn't going to challenge it. Still, it is exactly that -- a cope. It only works if 100% of the players do it and can be trusted not to go against the self-inflicted policy, which is impossible in a game like Eve. For sure, we're not going to do it.

You have asset safety, you have jump freighters, as a small corp, in a small alliance tucked away in jspace, we are all smiles as we watch the people who can’t adapt in null and hi-sec collectively freak out.

Formerly a Provibloc defender under Yulai, they moved with YF to join Legacy coalition before the alliance failcascaded. After that, they intended to move back to Provi, but were met with some bad attitude. Now as I understand it, they are part of a small group that harasses Providence.

People fuck with drifter spawns in J space and use them to their advantage in pvp all the time.

oh yes, and the only way to reach it is via Drifter WH at random

i am thinking for myself, i looked at mittens agrument and points and came to the conclusion that i agree with him.

You... didn't say that at all. You didn't say anything about player advocacy. You said that CCP sometimes has to nerf dominant playstyles. CCP, as you may recall, is the company that creates the game, and the sole arbiter of game changes.
---
I'd ask the "are you in the right thread" question of you. You're all over the damn place.
---
Honestly the days of back to back T3C fleets are mostly gone. 'Most' larger WH corps run a wider range of fleets than before, Triglavian ships, Cyclones, command ships being prominent.
---
I'd look to make sure you have a alt that can scan decently, and a sabre alt is mega useful. As long as you have decent combat skills and are willing to adapt and learn and scan/scout for content you'll be fine, you can train then towards whatever your chosen group prefer to fly. 
---
Good luck, hope to see you out there :)
---
Since everyone doesn't log in and only posts on r/Eve, it was only a matter of time before people created alts on reddit  
---
(on a more serious note: you appearently don't spend enough time on this sub, because there are multiple ISDs posting here)
---
look in game you will find very good friends, I even got together outside of eve. 
---
There is the eve fanfest were hundreds get together from around the world for party. I mean people could harass you in game and camp you but nothing is personal.  When I started I was lucky to find a nice group they teach me and game a bunch of stuff back in 2009 and is a great memory.
---
Can your advancing-time machine be repurposed to help you make more sense? :-D
---
Nobody actually wants the over with drifters. They want it to happen to other people and watch it tear down other people's stuff. Running into it yourself is shit. You can try to outsmart or overpower other human players. Running into drifters is just an RNG 'you lose everything' roll.
---
Hahaha this ! Current EvE state is critically close to the class 30 singularity.
---
I took your comment the wrong way apparently. I think it's fantastic they did. It shouldn't happen all the time for new events but I think having to actually have a defensive ready and defend instead of just reap the bounty of stagnation is a fantastic shake-up.
---
Obviously the answer is more alcohol
---
Can your advancing time machine be repurposed to help you make more sense? :-D
---
#2 is less a lie than #3, #4 is what I pray to now when I leave a jet of livestock at the star of our system once a week as a offering to Bob.
---
Can get a cream for that?
---
Its the grey fleet, not the contingency
---
&gt; its just a temporary event that makes eve even more stale
---
As stale as bashing undefended structures? I don't really see much of a difference. Perhaps shooting Drifters that deal tons of damage actually makes things more exciting as you'd have to broadcast for reps. Versus orbiting FC, negotiating most bomb damage from a structure.
---
Perhaps you would've gotten some more actual content if 32,948 versus 23,579. (Fun fact that is GSF comapred to PL, NC and PH, on need to even add other Imperium members.)
---
And you wonder why NC. and PL don't defend their space smh.
---
don't worry friend. No one is good at eve. We're all just different levels of bad
---
Yea, kinda makes sense when the Drifter spawning/aggression was mostly random. Having CCP design a system for them to schedule NPC behaviors based on successful vulnerability timers seems like a boatload of effort for just some world event. #poscode
---
Mittens is cool no worries
---
Well, it certainly can’t be LESS alcohol. That’d be against the rules.
---
shame HTFU hasn't been CCP's mantra for many years now.
---
You're an idiot bud, quite literally just towing the line with your head up your ass and not a care in the world.
---
The shortsightedness is calling off a war for a few structures being shot by NPCs that your leadership figured out how to beat a few hours after the attack.
---
BUT DO CARRY ON EATING FOAM COUCH CUSHIONS
---
Sounds about right, bold included.
---
(And it was because of the sign before the "2")
---
Wait wait wait, I've been out of the game for awhile. EVE got invaded? Like, what exactly does that mean? Are parts of high-sec under attack from drifters? Are drifters attacking null-sec citadels and stuff?
---
Or is there just more slightly harder to kill rats flying around now?
---
again you're literally demonstrating how short sighted you are.
---
Bob martins lice and flea powder, you can find it in pet shops. Worked for me that time in Morocco.
---
Change is definitely in the air. Still not sure what it smells like though.
---
Besides burning metal. I think my nose is just bleeding again from the constant erection from all this salt intake.
---
Korean Jesus ain’t got time for people’s problems
---
I miss the long wall of text post explaining ways to fix lowsec :( now its drifters and reposts
---
When you've spent your entire eve career living in effective safety from any kind of real danger, it's jarring to actually face potential loss
---
For the future, how do I start a sentence with a “#” without yelling?
---
What.
---
Even we assume that #1 is correct (it's not but I digress) it does not immediately qualify that #2 is. What a huge logical leap you're making to argue your points. Doubly so when you use the same logic for qualifying #3. 
---
This is bad posting and you should feel bad.
---
Man, but the drifters were supposed to be erasing Goonswarm Federation from the map. You mean to tell me that players will have to do it instead?
---
They only think they are the smartest [*but are they?*](https://files.catbox.moe/rtcita.png)
---
EVE is a better game to read about than it actually is to play.
---
I've explained the current drama to my wife that does not play eve at all and when I mentioned "this after CCP just releasing an expansion called INVASION", she laught very hard. 
---
Are we not overreacting a bit? :D
---
Comic sans
---
&gt; Still not sure what it smells like though.
---
micro transactions and a liberal disregard for the players if it'll make them a quick buck.
---
Theres nothing short sighted about what I'm saying, but there is great cowardice in what you're saying Dave.
---
I'm sorry for your loss
---
If I knew it was a very competent gatecamp with people that consistently catch sub-2s stuff, I'd go for cloak MWD - just don't fuck it up
---
People at the top are hardly ever experts in the systems they are overseeing.
---
See: Politicians.
---
yes there is.
---
let me spell it out for you. you think what we've seen in the last... 36? hours is the end game. that's hilariously short sighted, you don't even have to look that far back in to the past to understand why that's a moronic stance to take.
---
Personally I will resub if the invasion gets to a point where Corps have to devote the majority of their resources holding back the NPC fleets.
---
Then I can return to my former life of troll bombing. xD
---
I am playing again after years and will immediately Omega if this happens.
---
One single tear to salute natural selection in all its glory.
---
No, but why does anyone think this is permanent? There's nothing to indicate that, and by following the whole invasion storyline and release it should be obvious that a future phase will be the end of the invasions. That may even be the next phase, who knows.
---
It's false panic. Nothing indicates that this EVENT is permanent.
---
My comment was none of those things. Just an observation about your posting. You are like space Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
---
That's true in the real world, but Eve is a video game and the majority of Eve players play it because they like shooting spaceships with other spaceships.
---
I’m amazed at the number of people taking your Title seriously and apparently not reading the post. 
---
Sounds like you’re gonna fit in perfect, slasher is a great ship to start with - you can learn multiple play styles from that one hull. Good luck and hit me up in game if you have any questions (I’m no expert).
---
Then you better leave null, and get in a wormwhole. Nullsec is very safe...
---
Going to need some proof here bud
---
I am really enjoying the positivity on this sub recently. Love you drifters. 
---
(I may have had wine, that helps)
---
I'm going to hazard a guess and say the vast majority of people complaining about the Drifters... are the same that complain about EvE being stale. 
---
This is possibly the greatest thing to happen. 
---
I was reading that PCGamer Article on it, and they were quoting Dran, who I think is some TEST Recruiter. The way he was responding to the event was infuriating. Saying things like how they were "prepared" for Pilots and that it was a natural state of the game. Heaven forbid CCP try to do something NEW with the state of the game, and actually try to shake things up. Then Mittani was complaining about a war being stopped? GOOD! It's immersive, creative and new gameplay.
---
Both of them just read as if they had thrown their toys out the pram and that they may have to do something slightly new or have their "empire" challenged.
---
Well, since they are an AI, it was likely trained with that data, so they bash :3
---
*tin foil hat back on*
---
This is odd.. on eve carrer page they have listing for the london office which is making a new Action mmo...  Three lines caught my eye.
---
"Minimum 3+ years combat design experience on a shipped or live online multiplayer shooter with both PVP and PVE experience."
---
"Third-person shooter combat design experience."
---
"Familiarity with the EVE"
---
So either this is for nova.. or something eve related, like an eve2..  As a new game would not nee dot know eve unles sit had to do with eve.
---
*tin foil off*

anyway carry on!
---
Thanks to the absurd kin/therm tank they have, yep!

You're bitter: you xlaim to have quit Eve Online years ago, yet still deign to post about it.

The structure that someone posted the other day about them finishing the timer was already on final timer when the drifters happened to attack it.

That mittens tweet is FIYAH HAHAHAHAHA

I'm confused I thought Goons had so many titans and built so fast they could defend at home and on the road? Guess that was a bluff.

Agreed.
---
It should only take one.
---
&gt;TLDR: Make Supers, Titans, and undefended structures easy to kill.
---
well at least you're honest about it, unlike most people.
---
You don't have fun, do you?
---
Goons have been carrying the "CCP is out to get us" chip for years. It's part of who they are. Or do you not remember the time they threatened to make CCP ~bend the knee~ because they released a portrait background mittens didn't approve of?
---
Nah, they are the bottom feeders of such an amazingly wide and deep pond.

Observation of prevarication of Ancient Enemy Azdaja in reverse-time affirms casting and winnowing in repeated-time of invocation of extirpation of augmented human narodnya.  Continued awareness of Azdaja in advancing-time by augmented narodnya yields following-time acceptable material realization.

I don't get why people are mad about the 1mil SP givewaway for the anniversary event. Like what in the actual fuck?

Ad infinitum a nauseam: the very best gamer community anywhere.
---
I upvoted for the title but then I read the post.
---
What do CCP set crisis strength to?
---
Eve has plenty of "toxic" people. Plenty of helpful people as well. Generally even the bad ones aren't dicks to noobs though.
---
I haven't played EVE in 8 or 9 years. Not because it isn't a fantastic game, honestly I think it's the best game ever made, it's just that there are too many extremely strong, massive groups of players who control the fun parts of EVE. There's no room for the little guys, or even the medium guys, anymore and that means my playstyle is dead. Even if they did a full server wipe, xp, inventories, everything, there'd still be these groups with 10,000 players and they'd just end up putting null right back where it is within a pretty short period of time.   
---
It's an amazing idea and I love the complexity of the game, but it will never go back to being the fun thing that it was.
---
Wake up.

Oh dear lord, CCP blueballed the entire playerbase... we should have seen this comming to be honest.
---
They didn't only bide their time, they also killed Jamyl for her role in the mass killing of Sleepers by yanking them out of storage to harvest their tasty implants to make Dusters.
---
Does Mittani have any proof that he doesn't have donkey brains?  Like, any official documentation?
---
Mittens literally was balling his eyes out at a eve meetup recently... Guy's got some serious emotional issues HAHA. Imagine when he's fucking old and grey. Talking to his grand-kids (If he can actually ever get married). "What did you do with your life grandpa? I was a legendary internet leader my dear child... LEGENDARY!"

Blah blah blah hätte, hätte, Fahrradkette

This is a CCP Conspiracy to try and force us to work together with our enemies. They have grand dreams of us holding hands and bringing the universe back together. No Thank you

Sounds like CCP should be focused on fixing that then rather than this stuff.

You're decision to disregard any number of responses doesn't make them not valid.

You're more than welcome to fully subscribe to the world view of your leader, but it's niave to expect everyone else to agree with you. *Especially* when your leader has shown persistent and blatant disregard for anyone or anything that doesn't further his own world view.

N1 comment!
---
Sad to be honest... either CCP's balls retracted back inside today or even the new AI find structure's timers to be a really shitty implemented mechanic.

Maybe the scale, method, and faction choice is interesting, but who could really have been surprised as much as reporting on the issue is making it out to be?

That's true tbh, have my upvote.

Dual webb fit is probably a fw range control obsession fit.

Most fw fits are range control obsessed.

Minnie have some of the bet frigs in the game, besides breacher and slasher, there is also firetail (old rifter +1 med slot in philosophy) and vigil fleet issue (best navy frig overall, with that incredible webb).

Not to mention the dramiel/daredevil which are semi-minnie in nature. :)

Hi!

Partisans SIG were deployed there for less than a week then called back to help on Tribute timers.
---
But narrative.
---
Hahaha i love your commemts! Tgat retard is so amazing keep going
---
My problem? None, im just a meme maker for our Lord Tyrannos
---
I won't speculate too much, but FEDUP had the drifters form up to shoot the armor timer on a few structures.
---
They formed up on grid with a raitaru about 30 minutes before the timer started, at which point fedup engaged with the drifters. So from the looks of it the Drifters do follow up on the timer if you don't purge your system of the drifters during the intervening time.
---
Sir mitch.that was funny.
---
Hold my quafe zero!
---
Possibly that the Drifters have been scanning/surveying for quite some time and only now we’re ready to strike.
---
The Trigs may just be getting started?
---
Edgy Neckbeard spotted.
---
Hilmar started legitimately playing the game again, and I would like to believe his first hand experience with seeing the frustrations the player base has, has really opened his eyes. 
---
Maybe the purchase has freed him up to be able to actually get down in the trenches more, instead of managing the business. Who knows.
---
Attributes is a whole other ballpark. I'm just talking about skilling up based on their choices.
---
Even Ben taking shots.
---
The who?
---
There sure must be, because there's no way a goon would ever make a cringey post on /r/eve!
---
Okay idk if I’m getting baited here just because of the first part but the huge flaw in this thinking is symptomatic of how shitty eve has become.
---
You shouldn’t wish for the game to be shaken up by an NPC. You should wish for game mechanics that allow hard working players to shake it up themselves.

Are the drifters invading the ones with the DD?

Nothing that's happened in the last 36 hours couldnt NOT be dealt with through jump clones, and you're pearl clutching cant help you see the future. Considering that the rollout has been a week or two at a stage, you are the hilariously shortsighted coward.

I don't care if it gets up voted. I actually like the image in the end...just don't know how I feel about the Corp honestly
---
Is this a shitpost? Mittens has one goal and one goal only - to ensure that CFC continues to dominate nullsec to the detriment of *everybody else*. They don't care about gudfites or any of that bullshit. They don't care about the state of the game being any good for its players. All they, and Mittens, care about is how the game can serve their interests. Nothing else.
---
From the number of Wreathe &amp; Tayra wrecks I saw at gates I would say the hi sec Trig invasion also had a detrimental effect on AFK travel &amp; distribution bots
---
You’re breathtaking!
---
LUL
---
And what would that look like in your opinion? Better graphics? Completely different mechanics? Or just server wipe? This isn't a game you make a sequel for, just like you don't make a sequel for World of Warcraft, because it makes very little sense as opposed to constantly improving the game.
---
&gt; the dude knows what works
---
He knows what works for his coalition. I'm not sure what interest you have in his coalition continuing to be the overwhelming dominating force that it is in EVE, but if your interests align with his, then I'm not sure why you're here.
---
&gt;Considering that the rollout has been a week or two at a stage
---
yes, which is a very short amount of time between phases.
---
See, you're continuing to try and shame me as if I cannot afford this pack.  I wonder why that is, and what it says about your character that you view someone with limited resources in such a negative light?  Do you derive your self worth from your bank account?

Awesome, can’t wait to check them out. And yea I was going for range control because I thought I might survive that way (skills are so low). Didn’t work ))

unlikely to see a proteus if you have 15 people nearby, unless your using a wh in which case one would also need a wh nearby lol
---
*Yacht Party
---
Something chess something pigeon something shit around something.
---
The media planned it!? Media trigger war to get views confirmed.
---
I think at this point they are just roaming gangs that hit anything they happen to come across, regardless if it's a ship or a structure. Still a pretty neat addition to NPC interaction. 
---
Some of the interesting things that could come from this are NPCs that cause timers and players that show up to finish them. The NPCs could also by chance show up to a structure timer caused by either another NPC or a player.
---
&gt; you think that won't immediately kill the game?
---
Pretty sure it won't. Pretty sure the current state of the game is literally killing the game just fine (see the blog post stating a 4% player retention rate, which is hilariously terrible). It's time to kick down the sandcastles.
---
&gt;unlikely to see a proteus if you have 15 people nearby
---
Well it's happened if you go look at our killboard. Yea we sneak one system out and then when they tackle the brick tanked bait ship we warp in.
---
The dude sees the game from a view point that only half a dozen or so people do. Why is his viewpoint more valuable than the thousands of people that actually play the game?
---
dinosaur Xd
---
I mean I kinda agree, since it will make players actually log.in and move their shit if they still care enough. This invasion will drive content, we just don't know how yet.
---
Also, per every release, CCP is watching the fake world they made give so much salt. Let's be honest here fam. Doesn't Hilmar and co live off out salty salty tears?
---
Well done, definitely approve there
---
Yes, they were injected with a script written in NCdotteNET
---
Oh...
---
Afaik, we haven't seen any of them use DD yet. But I haven't seen any super losses either yet, so people are playing it safe.
---
Bypasses animism entirely where invisible people live inside actual physical objects.

Mittens logs in about as much as me (i quit the game last year)

&gt; Discuss!

There is no AT this year.
---
Someone thought it was about their invasion. Turns out it wasn't... pika?..
---
ty i have amended it
---
if it's 500 then I'll do 1 mil each
---
This is when they return AoE DD's to the game.
---
Fuck, it still hurts.
---
I think the main reservation people have is that it’s kinda breaking the “rule” of null sec and introducing a pretty powerful NPC element. Of course, give it a week or two and everyone will know the optimal way to dispatch drifters.
---
Personally I like it, perhaps CCP’s vision of null sec is changing a bit. When the players make it stagnant, they have to induce a bit of change. Fine by me.
---
455 to be exact of which 135 females :D  
---
PM me if you really want them.
---
That sounds pretty fair so far.
---
I'm going off his story.
---
His story makes me not trust the video.
---
He seems to immediately know what is supposedly wrong despite it being an odd issue to have and he complains of regularly losing ships to these kinds of errors.
---
Those aren't things that make this a trustworthy video.
---
Can we keep a spreadsheet of all these “yay excited newbro” posts and track how long they stay active in the game? Would be fun.
---
"There was no warning!"
---
Forgive me if I'm stating the obvious, but it seems to me that the community is attacking Mittani out of a mixture of envy and well-earned dislike.
---
If your yardstick for a person is whether they are able to build a powerful organization, then you're probably quite satisfied with Mittani generally. There are a good number of people like you in the world. 
---
But my experience is that, in the end, a person is ultimately going to be remembered on how well he treats people, and Mittani doesn't have a great track record in this regard. If it's true that he's a trust fund baby, he's probably never experienced nearly as much need to learn to treat people well, as most of the rest of us must do just to get anywhere in life. What I observe about Mittani is that he's notably dickish in his tweets and fireside chats, drunkenly goaded a guy toward suicide, throws out temper-tweetstorms that would blend right in with the downvote wasteland on /r/eve without his name on it, and generally just gives off this millennial CEO cum space-Hitler vibe that puts people off. He gets away with it because the Imperium is powerful, and because his followers have seen worse. It's how most of us deflect. They're not exactly wrong, either. But again, how we're ultimately judged upon is whether we treat people well, so Mittens gets criticism at every juncture.
---
Is the criticism fair? Kinda not. His comments are judged in the harshest possible light. Good example is the "don't report bots"-Gate. He could have been a more sure-footed politician in that matter, making clear that he doesn't support botting, but in context, I can understand his stance - no goon likes goonfucking. But he was needlessly douchy to the person who asked, so the community roasted him. It's just how life works. And at some point, blaming everyone else but yourself starts to reveal something about you.
---
When I roam this sub and see people remembered, *even in this community* I see the best-regarded folks aren't leaders of massive empires but lesser known guys. They and their corps moved on long ago, but they FC'ed 20-person gangs for a couple years here and there and were just "great guys". Chill and mature and decent - **including when they didn't have to be.** Take that for what you will. You could take over all of Eve, but if you come off like a fresh cunt while you do it, what's the point?
---
So if I have quit 6 mobths avoo because of no goog PvP options and stagnation in null, I'd come back to shoot drifter rats?
---
Not sure I'd come back because of this abd I am very close to quitting now btw.
---
The memes have been top notch recently /r/eve 👏👏👏
---
No doubt eve is the worst MMO except for all the other MMOs.
---
the server costs might be too high, that's why I don't considered both together. but you're right in theory.
---
The most impressive feat of that enyo killing the caracal was the EIGHT other ships it was tanking.
---
The guy is literally a human mcmuffin.
---
maybe they haven't heard of out-of-game 3rd party timer apps?
---
That is false. It takes way more than two. I used to farm bs's for antikythera for hours. Maybe if you are autist fit but they aren't that great
---
Try all episodes.
---
Imagine the chaos if Drifters show up to a fully contested final timer.
---
I think I’m missing the point that your getting at.
---
Would guess x2 strength as they really haven’t done much damage.
---
Does vydra need more OP ships?
---
Or it is deception of the highest order!!!
---
Get the enemy to think you won't fight for the timers.
---
Until they stop forming for them.
---
Then strike!!!
---
Almost exactly my experience. Back in 2007 =\]
---
What? Players actually playing eve and not crying on reddit? What year is this?
---
Just ignore goons, pl and any other long standing autist brigade and it's the best game out there.
---
Depends, are you stupid enough to think Tiamat and Hydra are OP ships?
---
read his name
---
Ah no wonder why it doesn't work
---
"I can't get my (dumb enough to follow me) in game slaves to deploy my massive supercap fleet in 100% safety. CCP is so terrible because this only effects us. Actually everything effects us as were the centre of the universe."
---
FTFY
---
EvE players? Overeacting? Lol surely not!
---
Not even close to the super salty Dead Sea. Obvious fake.
---
Well said! When I say the same thing, I get downvoted to the ground by the Reddit RNG hivemind if retards.
---
CCP are desperately covering up the cracks because they see how much nullsec stagnates. Active pkayerbase is hemorrhaging like crazy, so emergency actions like this one have to occur to keep nerds logging for timers
---
Holy shit
---
Mittens has a nutsack?
---
It's not that he isn't well informed or.knowledgable, it's that his statements are inherently unreliable.
---
He has a vested interest in changes that benefit his group and against those that would harm it, irrespective of the impact it would have on EVE as a whole.
---
That's probably why they're so pissed off and want to kill everyone and everything.
---
Yeah lol so I'm in the process of making a new char rn then I assume I can buy those skill extractors and trade em to this new character some how I believe
---
That would be epic
---
The only salt that has come from this has been autistic goons.
---
\&gt; so instead of following the hivemind, how about you think independently 
---
Says the goon.
---
This entire post
---
Pi / Fibonacci Sequence
---
lol if ccp got the balls to shut local down in 0 sec and also lets no assets through to low sec via asset safety... thats a htfu mentality i can get behind
---
It is the equivalent of a bag-tent that when deployed magically grows into a palace.
---
Unpopular opinion follows. Prep your downvotes.
---
Not sure if you recalled, hut the old outposts and 'egg' that you had to build on were the best mechanics ever. And the most realistic one.
---
Now keepstars can fit inaide a JF or a rorqual and be deployed in 24h. Stupid af.
---
Kinda like this: https://youtu.be/9Sj89hMVYhI

---
Yep remember eggs well.. and I agree..
---
But it being bad for your business doesn't mean it's bad as a whole.
---
Just a salty bitch. Nothing to see here folks.
---
I've watched videos about that game but can't decide if it looks like my thing or not. Any advice?
---
/u/chucknasty92
---
confirmed where
---
Nope not wrong. You'll probably join test eventually right? Haha
---
The luminous white of salt.
---
I think it implemented in game when the drifters and shattered wormholes came out. Basically Sansha said "drifter tech good, sleeper take good, must take" and sent his minions in there.
---
Looks like they’re finally playing their own game!
---
Extractor is .5 bil, and then it depreciates by half skillpoints after i think 20mil skillpoints then more after
---
Huh. I guess that goes to show how often I use injectors. (i.e. never)
---
This is why community management is such a $&amp;@€%# job
---
well if they regulary come back and do the first timer, isn't that basicly taking away the first timer from aggressing party?
---
maybe destroying citadels becomes less of a headache with this
---
Pick a color. Any color.
---
I’m actually surprised on how some slaves are marveled on why others dont applaud their dear leader...
---
&gt; remove damage cap from shield and armor timers
---
Thats Not gonna work remember what a dd does in dps?
---
A quick volley of dds and a ks in rf 0 Chance of holding it with the New Fax mechanics
---
Eve is like a second job. It takes a lot of time and usually one can find himself doing nothing for hours, while waiting for an ambush or something.
---
On the other hand when shit goes down, they go down hard. It was the first and only game where my heart was racing during pvp, and there are always epic moments that will stay with you forever. Furthermore the social aspect is a strong point of the game, and you can form bonds with people that you would never meet otherwise (single shard has that benefit).
---
It's not a perfect game by far with a number of issues, but it's graphics are breathtaking. If you have a lot of time to spare, I would say give it a try. Join a corp also, this is a must for better experience.
---
I miss the deep space transmissions. We get a new one soon?
---
They're only salty because they can't use reddit for war propaganda .
---
Memes aside, I really hope CCP doesn't get into the habit of regularly fucking with the meta without getting proposals and feedback sorted first. I like this, but the premise of a surprise-fuck-your-citadel can easily go wrong.
---
Hey /u/ccp_falcon don't you have a wishlist that disproves this?
---
You are a quick one huh.  Still salt is it not?
---
Background music looped, one time, two time... 70 times...
---
Toxic? No far from it (mostly inside jokes and making fun of each other's alliances). A little bit insane with a sprinkle of sociopathy? Perhaps. Games like League will have far more toxicity because there you have something to lose whether it's rank, time, whatever. In Eve the only thing you can lose is your isk and that's it. No really cares if you constantly get blown up because there's nothing to lose besides your dignity at best (\*cough\* died to a venture once \*cough\*)
---
Anyone who seriously uses the word "toxic" is probably a snowflake that needs a good dose of reality. These are the same idiots who call things "problematic." 
---
Glad you could see through the BS and are having fun!
---
As someone who wanted to try EVE for a long time now I can definitely tell now that I'm not going to try because of this event. It actually discouraged me a lot. I don't want to invest myself and years later be punished in such way.
---
unfortunately a wish list doesn't trump about 4+ years of patch notes.
---
If we get Fozzie and Hilmar drunk enough it does.
---
Given how mad Mittens got about having to call the Super fleet back to defend Delve, Blue...
---
Yes this may cause an issue but then you also have a fleet of vulnerable buffer titans with dds on cool down. To dreadbomb. Another option may be damage cap starting at 5%.
---
But that's Artemis...
---
#( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
You joke but it may become reality sooner than you think.
---
I agree. 5x lets go CCP!
---
Serious question. Has he told us who he joined?
---
Someone needs to adopt them and lead them to greatness.
---
/cringe
---
We actually need a mechanic to determine a unused structure tbh and im Not speaking about low Power Mode which can be avoided with a clone Bay and a bit of fuel
---
Hey I thought the Project Nova trailer was pretty fitting for this.
---
Also /r/foundthemobileuser
---
Oooh, so that is what is happening when one side decides not to undock when the other side claims they would have a chance if only they would undock... Fleet in being strategy. Historical spin engage XD
---
What rhymes with radakos?
---
For future reference if you right click on your guns and hit show info. There’s a used with tab and it will tell you what charges the module uses. This also works on other things like the armor repairers that use nanite
---
I can't really speak in an objective manner as I really enjoy Stellaris. It's very fun, but games can drag on if you're in a larger galaxy. It's fun to make different races and messing around with all the ethics/government types. I've re-created the four major Eve factions, Caldari is a megacorp, Amarr as militarist/spiritualist, etc.  It's fun to watch a galaxy grow and change over time as empires rise and fall, factions form, and then crazy shit can happen with random events. It's rich with lore and story, if you take the time to read all the research reports from anomaly's your science vessels find. 
---
RNG can be a bitch at times, putting you, a pacifist xenophile that wants to be friends with the galaxy in between some fanatic purifiers that hate you and everyone that looks like you, or a devouring swarm hive mind (think tyrannid or zerg). 
---
My recommendation: Pick it up on sale if you're wary. (Summer sale is on right now!) And get the starter pack bundle. Comes with two of the best DLC, and at a cheaper price. Don't let all the DLC dissuade you, Paradox is notorious for having tons of DLC, but most of them are worth getting on sale eventually, and add updates to the game for free without having to buy it. DLC also is shared, so if you have a rich friend that has all the DLC and you play with him, you get access to the DLC for that game!
---
They will when you have literally hundreds of disposable supers

Dear nullsec:

Sometimes you actually have to lose ships in order to win a fight.
---
Anythingakos you fucking mongoloid.
---
Yes fucktard but not so fast that you need to pull up stakes instantly and run all your shit back home you spineless excuse making ninny.
---
Honestly I hope to god you're no any form of decision maker, In game or IRL, because if so somebody isnt getting tier monies worth
---
I'm glad to hear you're having a good time in the game. If you ever need anything, just shout.
---
No shit sherlock.
---
Hint: it starts with a ‘b’
---
Do triglavians tackle on gate in invasion systems?
---
You had me in the first half
---
If you happen to be talking about Stellaris. It’s an amazing game- if you’re patient and don’t mind a lot fiddling. For a beginner the planet management is a complete clusterfuxk, but once you get used to it and figure out how to manage things properly you’re good. 
---
Designing fleets to dunk opposing empires and watching them duke it out is deeply satisfying. 
---
It can be played casually, of course- with ship auto designs and such but if you enjoy a challenge you’ll have to get your hands dirty with some research into how to set your stuff up manually.
---
&gt; If you are unaware of The Prophecy of Macaper ...
---
ahaha - this is a great thread
---
&gt; as if it had a derogatory connotation
---
It does.  CNN is mostly fake news.
---
I would look into flying an orca as soon as possible. The ship maintenance bay + cargo hold + ore hold lend themselves quite nicely to industry related things. 
---
That plus it’s massive tank (1.3M EHP against antimatter, at max skills with the implant) will give you a huge amount of security in high sec. one thing to keep in mind though, is do not build structures of your own. Use current infrastructure like eve mogul or whatever. The reason is, if you have structures you can be war decced which means your transport ships can be blapped without concord intervention.
---
What? People logging in to play some shitty stagnant game and not crying on reddit? What year is this?
---
I've seen a jumpbridge and a cyno jammer destroyed. They do not follow up on their armor timers. But go ahead and think null is being wiped clean.
---
If you want to fly with us all ya had to do was ask!
---
[Sure.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/1b/98/2c/1b982c51f03f3a03f16a571cbb767e33.jpg_
---
The problem is that they haven't actually fixed shit.  Even if these things kill a bunch of a citadels, so what?  If they turn them off, they'll just spring back up again because nothing has changed.  I'm not convinced they actually have any idea what they're doing.
---
Yeah I mean Stellaris. I've played Eve for like 11 years.
---
Lol.
---
Yeah , unfortunately we have unconfirmed rumors that show that Goons have manged to train drifters and are searching for a way to unleash them onto hisec for next burn jita or perhaps sooner.
---
you're so out of touch it's painful. did you not see how long it took the imperium to get up north to begin with?
---
Still an underrated comment, despite 108 updoots!
---
no.
---
Just make out already
---
I got killed by Drifters before it was cool.
---
Adapt or die?
---
We're seeing a lot of "adapt or cry".
---
I'm shopping around for corps at the moment.
---
so what your saying is doing it 2 goes so i dont get burned too hard?
---
Love how guys that live in a system where you can super rat complain about the game being broken. It’s broken and boring cause your doing it wrong. Move those supers out to provi you will be broke in a month and the game will be fun again
---
Too bad CCP shut down the Eve total conversion mod for Stellaris.
---
No, but I'd still be happy to have either of them. 
---
Blops/covops ftw

Drifters should also deplete the asteroid belts, anomalies and moons. If you dont stop them then your space becomes scorched earth for a month.

Mittani is the biggest pubbie of them all.

I was actually hoping for this to be the first step, a big thing happening before a major and significant change of a core mechanic.
---
Just bad luck.
---
The "wormher btw" of religions
---
The only balance that needs to happen is:
---
The aeon would fall over on it side because mass is larger on one side by a substantial amount. Balance capitals !
---
I don't get it, these big alliances have plenty of people running pve or mining 24/7 and all the citadels have timers, its not anyone elses fault that they've spammed 0.0 with cits or that the dullsec blocs have 2 strategies, content denial or blot out the sun
---
Still literally who
---
Oh I've played Eve for 11 years. Sorry I should've been more specific. Anyway I meant Stellaris.
---
*Goons are mad
---
I haven't heard anyone from any other nullbloc complaining lmao
---
Honestly, I was there during the beginning of this. It was cringeworthy that I was wondering if he was drunk.
---
not like they lose much anyway what with asset safety
---
can't argue with you there. I am part of the problem.
---
And the angry crabs are complaining they have to shoot at red crosses
---
There's only one person you should listen to on this sub, and that's me.
---
Honestly, this is a bit hypocritical.... I mean everyone in here pretty much praises the new change, yet they praise the change for the main reason that it brings content ... really ?!?!?!? NPC content is that what this game is missing? What happened to "Eve is a PvP focus universe"? WTF ... are we all falling into this shitty bs CCP is doing... creating more content ... versus NPC ... yeah .. for me this is a clear sign that I need to find another game ... soon I will be playing against NPC only ... 
---
CCP should focus on creating more accessible PvP content, balance the super and the mechanics ... why waste time and energy to produce more NPC Content .. is that what people want from eve? more NPC content .. if that is true ... then I know for a fact that "old" players that have been faithful to this game will desert it really soon and really fast ... this is no PvP orientated game anymore and it becomes less so with every new patch ... CCP wake the fk up !!!
---
Up You’re meta...

"player vs. structures wargame"

Underrated comment right here.
---
'Alien'. PC gamer strikes again.
---
How desperate for attention are you that you went out of your way to post nobody cares?  Your actions literally contradict your statement.  Now prove that you dont care and fuck back off to where ever you came from.
---
Well you're courting the wrong game then. EVE is one of those games that you invest in and get punished for it constantly. There's a reason "only fly what you can afford to lose" is one of the most common proverbs among this game's community.
---
The thousands of pilots who fly with then lol you are a special one arent you
---
This 👆 I'd resub for this. Thinking about it right now really
---
Hey I've been thinking about getting into Stellaris... I like EU4 a lot, and enjoy HOI4, not a big fan of CK2. Do you guys recommend getting Stellaris? And if so, how many "necessary DLCs" are there?
---
Can confirm; just another Friday in wormhole space.
---
Yeah, the community makes up for CCP being shit.
---
750,000.01 ea.
---
It's fun to see Null players recoil in horror from swarms of rats.
---
It’s not all your fault ccp made deep null sec too safe from day 1 it should be a full time job to protect space f you live 40 jumps into null
---
Can someone translate this out of retarded edgelord and into English?
---
Haha
---
Literally winning eve.
---
I am no one.
---
We'll, after past couple days we know they aren't blue.
---
Is 300bil a lot?
---
There is already plenty of risk that groups have players worked for years to overcome and create a nice environment. This was not handed to us. People have to be on call every day to save people from their own stupidity. There are entire teams devoted to fueling structures and providing intel. This was not gained easily and requires constant upkeep. So go fuck yourself back to high sec
---
I could explain it again, but I have a feeling you're not actually looking for an explanation so much as a straw man to prop up.  There have been numerous discussions (plenty not involving me) about why the event was such a failure.
---
If you're such a pathetic loser that you feel like patting yourself on the back for not missing the million SP, let me remind you that those of us who did miss it were probably busy with friends and family and assumed we had one more day left than actuality due to shitty coding in the "days left" message that dropped from 2 days to less than 24 hours on the last night.

---
Bravo Zulu, Bravo Zulu..
---
You gotta admit, $5 for a million SP not even a month after giving away a million SP screams of desperation.
---
It wasnt whether or not they liked it. They went through the entire content in one day and started complaining that it wasnt enough. Meanwhile, people were posting a lot of appreciation for the new content and the way it was handled.

Divide the number of toxic people by at least 3 to get a more accurate count of how many toxic people there really are on Eve.

Is this a reference to the Chinese invasion happening at the same time? Im sort of confused

Tell snuff to stop killing my frigates when I go to pop their cynos then :(

They're violating my safe space.
---
The last few years and the current state of politics is proof you can't force players to fight. So a shakeup is needed to root the risk adverse out of their heavily fortified nests.
---
You think that posting on reddit is "going out of your way"? 
---
You must be new here...

I'm actually thinking this is a likely next step.

They are known to violate people's things, rather roughly.
---
(and I've been there mate, can relate)
---
You’ve taken what I said  and modified it.  I don’t speak in absolutes.  I didn’t say the “whole game” was changing to pve, you said that.  I said this change is heavily tilted towards pve.  How the fuck you getup- votes for your twisted logic simply tells me there are many retards here like you that cannot think logically.  To compensate for your skewed perspective you put others into categories that you define in order to buttress your whining.  And to your point of huge powerhouses that wardec...this explains to me how very little you know of the game and its history.  Huge powerhouse coalitions and such do not wardec and seek out little guys to “crush”.  As your whining indicates it seems you are just another grrr goons idiot with a flawed account of what actually goes on in this game.
---
By the way, I never predicted a breadth, scope, or duration of this so-called event.  My point, if it wasn’t clear, is this:  CCP have injected themselves into the game in a way that is disruptive and dampens player driven conflict.  Put simply, now we have to go fight a force (pve is a choice right?) that has interrupted our pvp.  That is to say that plenty of players enjoy other aspects of the game but at the moment a certain, very large group of players on all sides of the current player driven conflict are having to disengage and spend time facing NPC without a choice to do otherwise.
---
As a side note, the pathetic Tyrranos NPC do not add scare to this game, at least not for groups large enough to fend them off...the smaller groups will suffer the most so is this a win for CCP?  I think it is not.
---
The meta is the game, Eve is just the interface.
---
Creating timers and then blueballing?
---
Or not engaging unless they have a 3:1 advantage?
---
So, what's the lore behind the invasion? Why are the Drifters doing this? Where did they get the manpower and resources for that many ships? And what, if anything, will satisfy their urge to conquer?
---
I just need to not be lazy and d-scan first... last night I warped in on multiple hics and a few titans. And the cyno was a maller. Whoops.
---
They just messed up timezone conversation to eve time
---
this is a buff to station trading
---
A hell got fed to drifters on a gate day one of the invasion
---
Except it is _THEIR JOB_ to do develop shit to account for that. I work in IT. Here's a basic example: What if I made a form for a client that they could fill out but it wouldn't save anything when they clicked save? 
---
Typical half baked features from ccp. If they couldn't record which structures have been bashed by drifters _why even make the feature_ ???
---
I just joined today after these news! I might be a newbie that barely learns how to target and orbit but glad to finally be part of this crazy adventure! And really hope for some awesome stories that will be told about this event.
---
Godspeed good sir! o7
---
we here at test alliance look forward to welcoming our new drifter brothers into the great blue donut
---
I don't remember saying "null is being wiped clean," you seem to have me confused with one of the voices in your head. All I said was the number of structures is going to change. By your claim, that has already come true, so... why are you even arguing?
---
Offline POSes didn't go in to RF either even if they had stront in the stront bay.
---
I missed a couple of days forgetting to log in but I still managed to get it with plenty of time to spare. I thought the issue with the million SP was more fundamental than just people not being able to manage logging into the game for 10 seconds once a day and then crying that they missed out. I'm actually even more confused on how people are complaining now than I was before.
---
#FAKENEWS
---
You wouldn't believe some of the shit that's on my wishlist for EVE...
---
...that said, I don't work in development! ;)
---
Not sure I follow the joke here. Does it require a myopic viewpoint to understand? I'm fresh out.
---
Eve is awesome!
---
And shepherds we shall be, for Thee, Lord Bob, for Thee
---
Power hath descended forth from Thy hand, that our fleets my swiftly carry out Thy command
---
And we shall roll a chain forth to Thee, and teeming with wrecks shall it ever be

In Nomeni Apollo, et Artemis, Spiritus Cloaky
---
Moving the goalposts isn't going to help your argument, and EVE is currently the only MMO I play. I only included games that I currently regularly play.
---
Except that you could anchor the egg, fill it with materials and push button in under two hours. Then it magically became a station 10 mins later when downtime hit.
---
Sure it took a lot of effort to build the egg first and a freighter to move it in to place. But then that's similar for a Keepstar. A Keepstar hull is 800k m3. Which JF are you fitting that in to?
---
Fortizars on the other hand do indeed fit inside a JF / expanded rorq.
---
Yup. Would've been awesome to see the properly fleshed out design where they followed through on their targets. Sadly we get this half-baked nonsense that means this shit bares zero actual threat to any high-power structures.
---
im gay
---
Nice, same tbh
---
So Mittens is whining like a little bitch? What a shock!
---
"  Yes I'm a goon "  Yes I'm a goon ... " I quit this garbage years ago. " Pretty sure you have to actually play the game to be in an alliance
---
But they might commissar him for being this much of a tool on reddit.
---
Thank you drifters for burning nullsec 🥰
---
MCAV is recruiting!
---
Easy there chessur
---
is this for NC complaining about goons blopping?
---
This isn’t that?  You don’t think groups forming to defend against drifters won’t be harassed/third party’d On?
---
Psst.... join BRAVE. They give out free ships
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
I take this to mean we should just start a ton of shield timers on stuff and hope the drifters put things into hull for us :)
---
I'm hearing more and more that they aren't following up on the timers they set so it sounds like the castles will stay right where they were, you can all go back to complaining how the game is too safe again.
---
It's pretty clear english isn't his first language. I skipped reading the post and went straight to the video first. What I saw was pretty concrete evidence of getting fucked over by a bug that was in seemingly no way the responsibility of the user or their equipment.
---
Moreso with the fact that on multiple occasions recently I've had fleet members suffering from bugged modules that seem to fit the description of what I saw in OP's clip, though in their case the workaround was to drag the module to a different UI slot (which seems to have not been possible in the clip).
---
I probably would've lost a ship recently to a bug myself if it weren't for lucky circumstances. My ship was stuck trying to orbit in-place as if I was clicking in space in a circle pattern. It was preventing me from approaching a Titan to bridge with the rest of my fleet. I was luckily in tether range so I could dock rather than being doomed to be spinning in a circle in space uncontrollably. Docking/undocking, reshipping, restarting the game didn't even fix it. After some googling, I had to unbind the keys for manual flight controls to get it to stop, otherwise I was in complete lack of control of my ship's direction which most certainly would've gotten me killed or worse have to self-destruct my pod just to get back to a station.
---
&gt;  FC burnout is a thing and you don't need to whitewash it.
---
Everyone who actually logs into the game knows that, but a handful of very vocal people who exert no effort of their own like to pretend it isn’t real.
---
I have been in a sansha wormhole. It was full of sansha anoms that respawned almost immediately after the prior was finished.
---
I doubt the drifters are much interested in your little beefswelling.
---
Amorphous smudge = Gallente ships, so yeah
---
I don't see what's homophobic. It's a jab about sucking the Mittani's dick.
---
The drifters knew it was a PS3 exclusive
---
He's not homophobic, though.

I think Aryth keeps it in his office.

I'll say this as eloquently as I can in an RP fashion.

Burn everything fuck those cunts
---
I got killed by drifters during a triglavian invasion because I accidentally warped to one of their beacons in a Praxis and they insta-gibbed me.
---
Yes! I would resub all accounts for this!
---
Absolutely. The client is just the meme driver.
---
The only criticism in the end I think will be that ccp didn't go balls to the walls enough.
---
So we gotta wait for those Pink cat-ear Avatar SKINs?
---
:heart_eyes:
---
Please take your medication.
---
&gt; if NC and PL had actually fought
---
Did you seriously expect them to fight? Lol. Memes about undocking aside, it would have been abject stupidity for them to try to contest that invasion. You've put yourself in the same position you were in before - you've gotten so big you've simply escalated yourself out of all possible content. That's perfectly fine if your goal is simply to win, but in that case you don't get to complain when your enemies decline to suicide into you.
---
Oh shit.. that's a really good point. Thanks amigo
---
Not even Goons. Just Goon leadership. The line members seem pretty happy about this, by and large. Which must *really* piss off the Mittani, power-mad cunt that he is.
---
I see what  you did there!
---
Surprise surprise called it.  What a disappointment CCP. You had your chance and blew it .
---
Yeah this is why my dad and I stopped playing, the current meta doesn't allow solo people to thrive like they once did, but he said the same thing when I told him about the mess going on right now, they might see a influx of players they didn't expect
---
Will this make players fight? I highly doubt it personally, I just had to cancel 2 fleets this weekend that were going to go and poke at people because I know have to defend citadels, doing glorified PvE in T1 destroyers.
---
Damn. Myopic is such a good word. I'm definitely going to start using that.
---
If that were an Erebus it would be docked up, not out in the wild.
---
How silly of me. Of course.
---
Drifters are getting hyperaggressive and shooting player structures in nullsec. Nullsec Sovs are salty
---
Yes. Refineries in certain spots equipped with Moon Drills can tear city-sized chunks out of moons and drag them into space.

People were talking about a server reset. Maybe they're listening and did something their way.
---
If you have actual Intel please report it to dran it will be taken care of. What our renters do isnt our concern but test as a whole stands against botting. If it's going on without our allies or allies boarders we encourage their death and reporting them to the appropriate people
---
You bastard.
---
For now
---
&gt;What our renters do isnt our concern   
---
What people paying **you** money to live in **your** space do isn't your concern?
---
&gt;so instead of following the reddit hivemind, how about you think independently  
---
&gt;shut up and listen to the Mittani, don't express your own thoughts
---
Sure, buddy.
---
This is some next level shit
---
He doesn't speak for us; I do; what happens in our backyard is absolutely our concern.

why did you record cats dying

Fluid Routers are actually the systems which control FTL communications. So this is more likely signalling a change in local chat mechanics.

No way. This could be wild. I can build from the ashes again some day.

Honestly was hoping for Rickroll
---
I still want the promised numbers of bots banned in the last 365 days per alliance; I think you'll find KWG significantly behind the curve.  They botted a hell of a lot before we got here, but we made it clear when we moved in that we wouldn't tolerate it like past landlords did.
---
As for the rental alliance we run directly, it didn't even make rise's list, and it's ~3 years old now.  
---
That said, if you have any actual evidence beyond "these guys have similar names and ran away when I entered system" please DM it to me on Reddit and we'll investigate.
---
None of the dudes work for CCP anymore iirc.
---
They arent reeing on reddit though
---
Well they do hate the Jove apparently. I wonder if they prioritize SoCT ships?
---
I would not be surprised
---
I think you might have missed the part about this not being designed explicitly but learned behavior... Whatever the drifters are doing, it is "emergent" behavior based on learning done by player observation. It's not designed at all and that is the *whole fucking point*.

Just saying how it is. We're taking their money and if it's as obvious as the post is then we dont care what goes on in our boarders. I'd like to hope we care. Botting is bad for the game. But again. Test is taking the money. So they clearly dont care what's being done as long as the bills get paid
---
It just so happens that goons have an in-house expert on drifter AI. So it took goons a whopping 24h to figure it out. This also shows in "just a few forts" reffed instead of a staging keepstar like Frat. Curious to see what phase 3 will bring. I am betting trigs. Theory, wildly pulled out of my ass:
---
\- Drifters give no fucks and just burn everything
---
\- Trigs had their proven grounds and gosh for the sake of argument we managed to prove ourselves
---
\- Drifters and Trigs engage each other but can not kill eachother without the help of capsuleers.
---
\- Nullsec gets it's own spinoff of faction warfare. If you are inactive, drifters burn your shit. If you meet a certain treshold, let's guess and actively engage Drifters, Trigs show up to mop them up.
---
with asset safety, you're not going to lose much
---
Fuck Snuff
---
And the largest group is just shrugging it off, no big deal.  Sucks to be everyone else!
---
I don't know how the professional haulers have the patience to travel through 15 systems just to transport items.  I hauling small items in a frigate.  It took me 2 hours for some reason.  Maybe I made two trips because I forgot something? lol.  I went from verge vendor all the way to Rens in Heimatar.  Then I sold some stuff in Dodixie.
---
Thanks to the people who sell stuff in verge vendor.  Prices might be slightly higher but that is o.k.  Sometimes I don't feel like going to Essence or Sinq Laison to buy stuff.
---
For creating Stellaris empires of EVE factions what do you think Triglavians are? I made them Fanatic Militarist / Spiritualist but it could go other ways
---
There is no penalty to loot drops for Alphas, the only disadvantage you will have is running them slower with the alpha restrictions so slower clear times.
---
Don't fly carriers to fight them, the fighter will die in droves. Shield dreds with significant amounts of subcap shield logi is honestly your best bet
---
Jesus Christ I can only get so erect
---
Also true but not really important here. If they come back it's game changing.
---
Eve is stale as it is, for once something is happening, and more than likely won't run forever. This event is hitting everyone, no one is getting special treatment. Smaller groups don't have huge amount of citadels to defend, so it's easy to defend them. HTFU and just play the game, don't let no pencil pusher tell you how to have fun. At the end of the day Eve belongs to CCP, and they will do what they do for good or worse.
---
Maybe if half the game wasn't part of a single entity with a massive sprawling empire you wouldn't get stuck on the defensive so much
---
I can dream OKAY?!?
---
Honestly the bogeyman that is eve mostly lives in comment sections of pc gamer and rookie chat.
---
\&gt;  Then a week or so later when the bot devs had adjusted to the change there's now dozens of bots running through the biggest cities in the game to use a certain portal type thing to keep botting.  
---
I fail to see the connection between adjusting harvesting and running through cities to some sort of a portal.
---
Personally I think CCP have realised just how much the big alliances are helping along the botters which damage their bottom line.
---
Big daddy Pearl abyss took a look at the data and how much control these pseudo RMT farms in Null have over CCPs bottom line , turned to CCP and after suggesting they grew some balls issued the following instruction..
---
"FINISH THEM!!"
---
hahaha what it must be a truly sad state of affairs for this post to exist
---
Drifters showing up in nullsec isn't emergent behavior. It was planned. And they knew they'd be attacking structures, so it doesn't take a rocket surgeon to figure out that the next logical step to that gameplay would be needing a system to follow up on the vuln timers they were creating. Y'know, a behavior they could "learn".
---
I was under the impression that Drifters were actually one of the few NPC factions actually able to adapt tactics and ships over time based on what tactics and ships players use on them. I might be wrong but I think the choice of Drifters specifically was because 
---
1. They have that awesome threatening BS DD
---
 2. They are one of the "new generation" of NPC's capable of learning to a limited extent and coded dynamically such that they can be more easily tweaked in response to player actions, unlike the older hard coded NPC's.
---
I think the plan is to keep the Drifters JUUUUST strong enough to apply pressure to the Nullsec corps seemingly at random, without them becoming an overbearing presence in Null (IE once this initial wave of attacks is resolved I fully expect Drifter invasions to be a much more rare thing, perhaps only triggered manually for meta reasons (like special events or turned on an overwhelmingly powerful alliance) or reserved for systems with lots of abandoned or low power structures).
---
Fuck chinese.
---
Bring eog back :(
---
If OP didn't, I will
---
stellaris is a great and fun game but the diplomacy is not as deep as some of the other games you mentioned. As far as "necessary" dlcs the big 3 are synthetic dawn (adds robot civs/ more robot civs idr if they were in the base game), Utopia (adds megastructures and advanced slave and government options), and Megacorps (adds a new type of playable empire, galactic slave trade, and city worlds).
---
If you are not interested in robots synthetic dawn is not strictly necessary but they have a couple of interesting options. I would more highly recommend utopia and megacorp as the added megastructures, economy options, ascension perks, and civics are well worth the cost.
---
I haven't bought/ played the latest dlc (ancient relics) but the rest of the packs are mostly added species art packs, scanning quest lines, some large space beasts that you get bonuses from when you kill, and some late game content. I believe they are worth it but i have played a fair amount of this game.
---
We thought it hilarious everyone was gloating about that Horde jump bridge dying to drifters when it was us (goons) that did the initial RF on it. Drifters came back and killed it for us.

This news of a potential shakeup with the Drifter Invasion has gotten me to install the game. Does the Empire you choose in character creation affect anything other than your starting zone and ship aesthetic? I want to be a merchant type character, but I also really like the design of Amarr ships.

Just reduce training time by half for all skills. Let people get into bigger ships sooner and join in on all the big battles that you read about.

it means you'll have a lot of people who will say "how high?" when you say "Jump!". Think about it.

Wana bet a battleship DD will at least disrupt it?

Jump clones are instant dave, do you fucking know how eve works? Like holy shit you excuse laden pile of human shit....
---
You transformed a Drifter into a beta male. 
---
That´s horrifying.
---
Ok I thought it was obvious but I meant maxed alpha skills for the magic 14, which is for the most part 3s and 4s with some 5s
---
Not really. Any race can train any racial skills now, so go with what you like the look and feel of.
---
weird, why'd you call off your attack then?
---
I’m curious if the same people said both: “man this triglavian invasion is weak. We got all excited for nothing. It’s all too easy. Where is all the craziness?” And “man this is bull crap, how are we supposed to deal with this invasion stuff? There’s just too many, and it’s too hard.”
---
I kinda feel like CCP read the initial comments about the invasion being a joke and said “Oh! You think so huh? *cracks knuckles* I’m about to fart in some peoples Cheerios today.”

I assume that ammunition is going at extremely accelerated speeds because of orbits? Yeah, totally orbits and relativity...

I agree

Yes, but.....

If you are not a skilled player who really enjoys PVE or a piece of shit botter, you are likely better off spending two hours working a real job somewhere than the many, many hours it will likely take you to be able to PLEX your account every month.

We’re not supposed to speak about this Cassandra.

You've got the order of events backwards.

Video games are for degenerate pussies with no money.

It was probably Cassandra.

Really cause it would seem your alliance pings say otherwise...
---
100isk says even the Trigs and Drifters will avoid low.
---
No your breathtaking !

I mean, believe what you want. I'm sure that the drifter menace is going to end us any day now. I'd recommend holding your breath.

if you enjoy 4x games, you should definitely check it out.

Just don't get lazy and lose it to smart bombs - has happened to me, more than once :P
---
God hates fags.
---
Thanks for that, I didn't realise this awesome sub existed!
---
Isn't this CCP's job?
---
If CCP implemented a machine learning algorithm that made the Rats learn from the players, this is basically what would happen.  
---
If the drifters start shitposting "made you form" on Reddit tomorrow it will be basically proven that this is the case.
---
So that's today's narrative?   
---
I wonder what tomorrows narrative is, maybe NC. can go to stain, since stainguy left for delve
---
It's worth noting, the only dlc I would class as ABSOLUTELY mandatory is utopia. You can do without the rest but utopia is basically necessary for the proper stellaris experience
---
Been to Hevrice half a dozen times in the last week, local was empty every time. Bring your freighters.
---
Clearly had no issues with exfil and are still reffing vale 👌
---
It was being worked on before CCP said if anyone did they would suit them.
---
Being toxic on /r/eve is like 90% of the fun of actually playing Eve though.
---
Not really. GSF has adapted faster than everyone, repeatedly.
---
Which is why Mittani acknowledging it as a thing and yielding his own mercurial bullshit to it is especially funny.
---
I haven't laughed all week. Just busted my sides. Thank you.
---
Oh wow, that is so on point. Those transmissions always freak me out. Gotta go play Stellaris now, bye.

Huh. ok. in terms of how long it's been since I PvPed, I still have an acsb Jag fitted with Autocannon. Apparently it's a missile AF now...

So sansha was actually in w-space for years before Caroline’s Star - they actually stage their incursions from systems we can’t reach (aka they’re cutting them off with spooky WH tech), and the one shattered sansha system is one of those systems. Before Caroline’s Star, it was a staging point - now it’s shattered and very much less useful lol
---
Not necessarily. The seventh prophecy would likely be the final event of the game, i.e. it occurs at the server shutdown. But it could be a way to introduce a rebooted EVE 2.0. Essentially the shockwave would burn out most of the gate network and devastate the stations and planets. Supplies would need to be transferred via jump capable ships, something the Empires relegated more and more to the capsulers as they relied upon the gates. The military capital ships wouldn't be sufficient for this task. The power of the NPC Empires would be shattered overnight and populations of planets would live or die based upon the actions of the capsuleers. Travel between systems would rely upon jump capable ships, wormholes and player constructed jump bridges. Potentially if it is used as a reboot mechanism then stations and citadels take massive damage and need to be repaired. They could suffer some loss in terms of assets within them, i.e. ships players are not in at the time would be damaged or even potentially destroyed.
---
From there it could go in several different ways. You could have more lawless EVE cluster or simply concentrate the surviving HiSec populations into a smaller group of systems whilst the rest become frontiers systems. Sec status would have a big shakeup. There would be an opportunity to revamp PVE mission focus around keeping the surviving populations alive and open up a whole range of options around improved mission AI and different mission types. Likely the game economics would have a major shakeup to focus more on the post apocalyptic feel. This in turn would drive a PVP shakeup as the value of assets and resources would shift requiring groups to move or change their focus, e.g. from mining to piracy.
---
Sounds like a degenerate 😂😂
---
You should see the DMs he sends me. Dude sounds like a salty ex.
---
On the bright side atleast they might be an ex
---
Nah. My ex was bad but he wasn't like this.
---
I've actually been arguing with some mouth breather named dave stark that i think you guys over reacted, its not that big of a threat and i was enjoying you burning the north to the ground.  Should have kept going up there until it was all a smoking ruin.
---
There are also some terribly toxic people ingame too though.
---
This is exactly what I’ve been thinking the whole time lol
---
Believe me, the players have picked up clues~ Not many things have happened with Drifters for a while, but those things that have have been pretty telling.
---
A few months ago, Drifters attacked player structures in one system (Semiki) and reinforced them - but they stopped because of something CONCORD did. Nothing like that in Null~
---
The trig and drifter story is very intertwined and has a lot of stuff to it going back into some of the most esoteric lore for EVE, there’s a lot to come~~
---
You're*

....and you've just revealed yourself as a MAGA retard as well
