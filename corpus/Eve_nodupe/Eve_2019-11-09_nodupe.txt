Oh I had no idea. Like moved there, or just vacation?

Oh come on, the doomsday spitting out of the tip?  Sure ain’t applesauce
---
&gt;"Ran out of hull." 
---
LOL
---
These are so good. Thanks for sharing.
---
Everything that doesn't go your retarded way is "bad design". Thank god CCP is not stupid enough to obey to every brainfart idiots like you have.
---
Forget it dude, Capable_BO_Pilot is a sperge convinced that nullsec is the reason of all the game's issues. Everything that doesn't go his way is either bad game design or game abuse.

---
Its time to just go ahead and give ccp the morale post.
---
I dont get it.
---
Legacy hasnt been blue for quite awhile. This is the mendala effect making you sound silly.
---
This post is weird. It's basically highlighting what is wrong with the game. Looking for a decent fight? Come to these three regions only because the rest are fucked.
---
FUCKING CALLED IT
---
well both of them are products of human imagination
---
Yes. ;(
---
Deferred income IS a liability though so I guess you're both kinda right. 
---
For those wondering why, it's a liability because accounting works on the "matching principle" i.e you match the income date with the date of the service rendered. If the PLEX hasn't been used, the service hasn't been rendered, so the company still owe that service so it can't count it as actual realised income yet. 
---
It's considered a liability because, technically, until the service is rendered the company haven't "earned" that money and it could be revoked at any point. Obviously in the case of Eve, you're not getting money back for any PLEX you purchased, but deferred income typically would be for things people have paid in advance for that could be cancelled, say for example 12 months rent. If the tenant leaves after 6 months, he could ask for the other 6 months rent back.
---
More like he was suicided.
---
Haha remember that moment!   
---
With mu bad memory that’s something :’)
---
Exactly. The only subcaps out during the later half of the blackout were bots.
---
Lol. You sound mad. Are you mad?
---
I hear this person KNOWS the Mittani
---
*Knew*. The Mittani has since been banned for failing to save some jump freighters.
---
I got a spiel about Eve players complaining about the New Eden Store. It seems to respond differently to the same input, but damn is it spot on.
---
Someone needs to get up higher and just reprocess+destroy all those ships+ore. That'd be fun.
---
Blackout was bad for the game stop ass sucking your nose has no reason to be brown.
---
And then died to a stand still after the targeta left. Soirce huntin ph capitals at that time in cloaky things.
---
I owned a chimera once...for a day....
---
No, you didn’t...
---
1) There are no 'patch notes'  
---
2) There is no 'dev blog'  
---
3) Sisi is patched with 500km on the Gate and Jammer (I would log in and get a ss, but its in VIP right now)
---
Glorious
---
And y'all wonder why we don't break up the band. With encouragement like this it's hard to resist.
---
Sunlight is the best disinfectant. Even if few of our readers have an immediate interest, it's good to share.
---
Super common. Always have been so far as I know. Always given away free by ccp. I just delete them.
---
Didn’t they have a mass test yesterday?
---
Someones gotta haul the carrier out of the port
---
BPC, sopoors
---
So let me just make sure I'm reading you correctly.
---
You say on one hand that your favourite thing is big fleet bloc fights.
---
On the other hand your strategy to get them is to hold out hope that one day, someone will attack the biggest blob in the game, despite the fact said blob has literally attacked all the other blobs recently who simply decided not to fight?
---
Thats some good logic. I hope for your sake you get your big fights. But you know and I know that you won't.
---
Just move it to jita and sell it on the market
---
If your dick looks like the Avatar you need to get that checked out.
---
You should write a song that reminds you to fuel your fort.
---
Here, I’ll help you start:
---
*One, two, scan the K162*
---
*Three, four, fuel the fort*
---
*Five, six, there’s an online stick*
---
*Seven, eight, can I bring my Drake*
---
*Nine, ten, failscade again*
---
its pvp killing mtus?
---
Hey i will drunk all!!
---
Wait, wait ... u actually read the missions text? o.O
---
like goons do ? :P
---
You sound traumatized.
---
If TAPI and CFC went to war, PanFam would certainly be on Legacy’s side.
---
Let me know if you see any ways to improve this:
---
[Coercer, Coercer]
---
Capacitor Flux Coil I
---
Eutectic Compact Cap Recharger
---
Salvager I
---
Small Capacitor Control Circuit I
---
Small Salvage Tackle I
---
Neah, we are not elite enough to use implants.
---
&gt;80% dev tim in NPE.
---
Which is absolutely frightening since this has been true for a few years now, and they have utterly failed at it while STILL being clueless as to why newbros don't stay.
---
If it will fit capacitor power relays they will give you better performance. Either way it's not a big deal for this ship and you should go with the cheaper option. That fit will work very well.
---
As mentioned, its an honor system. Anything brought out of wormhole space to sell in k-space we ask 10% for corp. If sold/traded internally, we don't tax it. There's not a great way to track this, maybe if we got fancy with reason codes for isk transfers? No clue.
---
The new one sure is shit....no clue why CCP changed it...
---
They can't even get their own code working right, I think the bigger problem is all of the skilled devs left/got fired, and the current crop only got hired because there's nobody else willing to work on a frozen rock for a one-hit wonder company.
---
You dont get the point. It doesnt matter. There are people who are different to you.
---
Ill take your skins if you dont want them
---
Partly sure
---
Fuck this guy
---
One of the most beautiful ships in the game I tell you hwut
---
Again, you equating two things that dont really need to equate doesn't make you right.  It was fun, and exciting, but the number of bots and the number of risk averse people can be higher than the number of people who like to fight in EVE.  
---
Eve is now populated by more farmers than fighters, as soon as you can grasp that two things can be true a the same time the world makes more sense Dave.  Things aren't binary.
---
Now that is never going to happen.  
---
Legacy and Panfam together are no match for goons. Legacy and Panfam together grow more slowly than the Imperium (just check the MER). The minute Panfam looks like it gets better, the Imperium will go "proactively defend against a BoB resurgence" and Legacy will follow suit because not following the goons might be dangerous and Vily can't have that.  
---
Legacy and Panfam hate each other, would not work well together, and would be pretty much guaranteed to attack one another after your great war.  
---
The cornerstone of Imperium policy is safety. They are in a position to prevent rival blocks from emerging, and they will do exactly that. Horde is simply no match for the Imperium, much as Tapirium propaganda tries to hold up the myth of being a beleaguered fortress ready to repel "ALL OF EVE"  
---
TLDR: it would take some very serious meta change before a new great war happened, and that's not on the horizon.
---
What would be considered bling? Also do you think an Armageddon can do emerging Conduit? With heavy missiles and drones thank you very much
---
&gt; Drops a ratting mach, approach F1, gets dropped and somehow gets tackled instead of just bailing, complains.
---
  
---
&gt; People are smart and defend their space with muninns, oh noooo, my dual rep brawling BS gets caught, oh no, complains.
---
&gt; Unplugs implants 
---
Man, there's a lot of things wrong with the game, and a lot of things that make roaming bad. But you somehow managed to show exactly 0 of those things in this video. Good job.
---
Gnosis is superb for (solo) gatecamping.
---
honestly, even big block warfare can be started with small groups e.g. corps deploy for content into bluetral regions. wars usually start like that. and even if it does not end up in a win or die war, it can nurture some big block skirmishes
---
Only on our discord. It's a fairly easy test to do yourself if you don't just want to take our word for it or if you think it's changed in Chaos Era changes.
---
&gt; It's not just storage size. Record count is very important and the number of transactions performed has a cost
---
I know, my company has a cloud hosted system with tables with 60 million records. You don't need any special tech for that sort of size of data as long as you get your indices right.
---
easily countered by having a single friend and 2v1'ing.  1v1 isn't the only FW content.
---
As long as you're white I'm sure they think the same of you friend.
---
PVE fit ships will never be equally good at PVP. If you compromise, you still have little chance to win, since you'll likely be outnumbered and die anyway.
---
Go full PVE and warp off when hostiles enter the system. Try to make ISK fast and your losses are easily replaced. Move to quiet systems.
---
If you like PVP, try baiting in a tanked ship with tackle mods and have friends on standby, then smash them fast. But this is content, they will be back for more and better prepared next time.
---
Common practise is to run, hide and ignore them, even, after they got you. People like salt.
---
...at least that's how I remember it.
---
If you're salaging in systems with high throughput (several Supers or Carriers) a Noctis is too slow to keep up.
---
You see Noctis turns slower than a Rattlesnake and is just as fast in Warp. If you loot a site you have about 500m^3 to 700m^3 + the MTU. So you can only salvage about 3-4 sites and then need to dock up. If you really want to salvage go for Salvage Destroyer and Industrial Transport. Those 40km^3 from Indus are really needed and ten times more compared to Noctis.
---
Others have suggested this but as part of a larger package - alt scouts in inbound systems are invaluable. Also safes set up in local. If it is the same group jumping you, bait them and show up in some PVP ships. If kick the crap out of them a few times they may stop showing  up.
---
This reads like a real estate listing for a studio apartment above an indian takeaway.
---
Yeah thats how it works best, but you're using an Indu anyways.
---
If you switch from Noctis to a Catalyst / Cormorant you don't invest as much ISK. Noctis cost about 300mil ISK in Null for the Hull and Medium Salvage Tackle T2, Salvage Destroyers cost about 60mil in Null because Small Salvage Tackle T2 is that much cheaper. Also Destroyers are faster than a Noctis in allmost everything, warpspeed, align and salvage too because of their 8 highslots.
---
The speed of a Destroyer allows you to restock on MTUs in your station if needed but srsly I just start sitting in my Indu and drop MTUs out of my cargo then dock and reship to salvage, dock up with the Destroyer again and scoop MTUs with the Indu, place them again in new sites at the same time. Then reship and again and again and again.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Got about 110mil-130mil loot per hour but Delve is packed with Supers and that inflates my Numbers a lot.
---
Can you tell us more about the levitating duck?
---
It's a shame they don't have the vitalshift skin for it that would look so good
---
hey aren't you that white supremacist guy? :thinking:
---
thats the point i fly with everyone who want to fly with me &lt;3
---
i don't see the point why i should not fly with any dude in eve,
---
human is human and what you doing here is excact the thing u try to insinuate to me lmao
---
The same way NC. does it, staying docked.
---
it is not,
---
i just try to entertain, with the bullshit i do in eve
---
That's a real thing, though. You're reacting missile fuel inside the rocket and jetting it out the back. You're definitely going to have a trail.
---
I’d recommend moving to a high sec area with quick access to nullsec that will allow your group to day trip into nullsec for pvp practice but offer a safe option to gather enough money and skills in the mean time. 
---
There are a few high sec to nullsec areas That I found really nice when I was new as it let me enjoy nullsec at my pace but still had ice mining, combat sites, level 4 missions, and plenty of ore belts. My old corp lived in Riavayed* about 8 jumps from Amarr and it was a nice pocket back there by provi. 
---
Other options is to grow the corp to a little bigger, more numbers means more diverse fleet comps.
---
mr dank right: LOL TrIgGeRed
---
also mr dank right: UR LITERALLY A GAY FURRY COMMUNIST FOR NOT APPROVING OF WHITE SUPREMACY GO VIRTUE SIGNAL SOMEWHERE ELSE
---
ok fam
---
Yes because I am a gay communist
---
this comment section is a goldmine
---
unironically talking about dogwhistling, join all-out
---
if there's something sadder than pulling implants its getting so buttmad about some rando doing it that half the comments are complaining about it.
---
If you want to do group PvE content, do incursions in highsec. Even if you weren't getting dunked on, doing PvE content as a group is usually terribly inefficient.
---
my char is 11 days old and my net worth is 125mil, thanks for the fit advice though, it might come in handy in about 6 months
---
Hi there :)
---
I am a moderator on the RIP discord, you can find us [here](https://discord.gg/fUJRaAf). RP is definitely possible in Faction Warfare, and in fact there are several corporation and alliances that heavily emphasize it. Come hang out and ask questions, you'll quickly find some like minded people I'm sure!
---
I will second this, the dankest fights the best FCs and by god does their leader love Faxes and capitals in general.
---
Carrierd*
---
I go over kill on glue use acrylic glue instead of super glue
---
"You're retarded" is not an argument either. The in-game alliance "Asatru Alliance" is one or two guys thinly veiled white power bat signal. It's confusing as to why you deny and/or defend that.
---
Nah, good riddance
---
They are blocking everything, including VPN.  Probably a firewall that blocks everything except stuff on the allow list.  I would pitch a fit with the boss.  But grind out the contract and show them your heels.
---
Do you still need help? We can do it together if you'd like.
---
You forgot the Cerb part of that statement! Lol GF!
---
I'd be interested in the STL(s) if they were available as well, would be a fun print.
---
Just hinting at how to make more ISK/h than a Carrier with next to no SP.
---
I think they made the rorq a capital mining ship. So train for that.
---
Oh and moon goo is not passive. Once a month a chunk of the moon goes flying into space and u have to actively mine it to get the goods.
---
Hey I've seen a lot of comments criticizing Near2, saying it was a spying tool and things like that. I only got that people used it for ratting but how did it work? What did it do? 
---
Just wondering because it doesn't really seem fair, and I'd never heard of it before.
---
What do you need?
---
"ignorant and lazy" lmao you sound pretty pathetic by saying that when all I see is profit from "lazy" people leaving shit all over space...but again...look at your self before calling others lazy you probably a fat dude living in your mom's basement still keyboard warrior
---
i thought volta was WH  and they hate supers and caps
---
I will and with my wife. You’re really skilled to share passions and it got me stick to this game and its community.
---
Thx again!
---
Haha
---
Same, didn't get on the levi kill but we got on a couple nags at least.
---
get in stain...quiet and plenty of isk
---
With Luttwitz, at Bastogne, against the Long Toms
---
Havent actually decided yet i enjoy model painting etc. So gonna probably sit and really start sanding and filling to get her ready....then fuckin debate myself for weeks on which skin i should put on it.
---
No u.
---
Very impressive, as with your other art I've seen.
---
Keep at it, your pictures are a safe harbor in the sea of shitposts on this Reddit.
---
Can also go to https://ashyin.space/jukebox.html
---
... drake fleets? 
---
thats new
---
first step of the bot detection routine should be checking for vowels
---
It's interesting that a perceived eviction fail is always really just a content citadel and they "never had any intent of evicting hahah gf guise"
---
are they scanning a monolith?    
---
by god what will happen next, are they gonna use bones to kill another?
---
You could had tryed a hauler contract.
---
Redfrog or similar.
---
That’s what we want you to think, our active EU-EN side (what I play in) is like 50 ish people on any day.
---
And yet, they amount to nothing when compared to WH bots.
---
Heresy!
---
Ok boomer
---
The number of people wrongfully banned are so vanishingly tiny that it's not even worth considering for some rando on reddit.
---
Welcome back
---
notice how I'm not the op?
---
what's with the attitude
---
3 day old chars probably means this botting setup was banned 3 days ago
---
And you can fit 1000 freighters with 1000 containers with 1000 items
---
Hi not the op?, I'm dad.
---
Krabbing is insufferably boring, so why not optimize the isk/hour so you spend minimal time doing it?
---
[deleted]
---
Shame CCP shit the bed on making the AT a thing :(
---
No you are not the developer, your the one who uses the tools developed to tell your story. As I stated CCP tried to give you guys things to fight over, but you chose to not invest. It is about you. Your sandbox, they are just janitors. Your, story.
---
If you want CCP to write your story, there is a massive invasion going on. There are other events and flashpoints to inspire some to make moves within the sandbox. In general null blocs make fun of those people. 
---
You can't even define your problem. You want a reason to fight, but that is our side of the equation. the things people suggest are things to fight with, not things to fight for. Without something to fight for then the sting of loss is minimized. If you want the sandbox to remain yours, then you must accept responsibility over your own justifications to fight. CCPs responsibility is to provide you the tools to do things, not to manipulate the system to force you to do a specific thing. This is always been true and understood in Eve, I do not understand why we have all seemingly forgotten this.
---
watched the VOD, keep it up.  DTM's e-sports caster voice impression driving me a little nutty though.
---
Make a new account, contract it to a character on that new account.
---
Do daily login on said new account, get another free standard cerebral accelerator after a few days from login bonus.
---
video please!
---
I think you should read your own comment. I was only presenting an alternate way of doing what you described yourself in your own comment. 
---
**You don’t get the point. There are people who play differently than you.**
---
Well, at least it's not an officer mod.
---
Just saying
---
1: I’m not goons, 2: nobody wants to spend the next half a year slowly grinding down sov with the only rewards being a few shiny kills and for them to return right after we pack up and go home
---
Thanks for the kind words mate, they really mean a lot, especially coming from you - you've done so much for the community over the years &lt;3
---
Yes...there is. VIII moon 12
---
&lt;3 mate, just &lt;3
---
Pico gang play-styles are generally representative of a vocal minority. 
---
Everyone wants FW to be better and FW does a great job communicating their needs. CCP just doesn’t seem to be listening regardless of representation.
---
Deal with some relogging, or pay an additional 1.8bil isk/month or $15US per month. I know i'd rather deal with a lil relogging.
---
DOWN LOW....
---
TOO SLOW....
---
Alright, I am not going to continue to go round and round. Everything you are saying is addressed in the above.
---
The lowest? I've never observed such a thing, it always goes to the highest that can accomodate the whole stack. If someone is buying 100 at 0.1 isk and someone else buying 70 at 40 isk and you are trying to sell 80 units then it will go to the 0.1 isk unless you break it into a stack of 70 and 10 then you will get 40 isk for the first 70 and 0.1 isk for the last 10.
---
I disagree. Given your "professionalism" and "general command of Eve" criteria, we still couldn't reduce the candidate pool below 20.  With "typically underrepresented expertise" one can point at three or four who should be on top of the ones list.
---
Dopamine already confirmed how valuable the diversity of expertise is on one of the TIS interviews and exookiz exemplified it in the summit so I don't see the point of us keeping debating over this.
---
Of course I'd know how to respond and how it would effect that environment. I spent a year talking to the FW guys and getting their feedback about what their biggest issues were and what they'd like to see. There's nothing in the NDA that prohibits me asking FW folks what they'd like to see or what their concerns are - in fact, that's fundamental to being a good CSM member. Olmeca has an entire discord server designed to help him gather input. 
---
If you play this game enough that people know who you are, regardless of what reason, you're going to know enough about EVE to be able to contribute on the CSM. 
---
You don't need to be an expert to serve on the CSM. You need to be an active player who cares about the game and actually plays it and if you meet that criteria you're 90% of the way there. 
---
It's more amazing how many people get on the CSM who don't fit that criteria, honestly.
---
Buy a Fedo, highest on market. Those are the purebreds. Feed the accelerator to the Fedo, and throw it on as cargo in a tri-tanked Atron. Put some exotic dancers in there with some tobacco and just watch the shit hit the fan.
---
So it's np with you when null mega empires get 70% to 90% representation with %25 to %30 population but suddenly small gangs are just a vocal minority to even deserve 10% representation.
---
I second this. The refer thing is nice. Just don't redeem until you are 5mil SP. That way you get past alpha cap. Or redeem all the way if you are omega.
---
We're going to keep debating it because you keep bringing it up. And with all due respect to Dopamine, he's not an EVE player and he's been on the staff barely a year.  I don't know how he can say categorically that diversity has value if he doesn't have the experience with past CSMs that were far more diverse than this one (this one is 8 nullsec guys, 1 high sec and 1 wher, after all). 
---
You keep trying to win this argument with me and you're not going to because you're wrong.
---
&gt; $15US per month
---
Yeah, but this gives CCP more money to spend on useless projects they will abandon later.
---
