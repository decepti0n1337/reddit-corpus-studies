Autocorrect is gay so I meant to say FW (faction warfare)

They have weird behavior and it varies. Sometimes they will do nothing, other times they will go and wait an exact number of seconds and launch lights, etc.
---

---
Most surefire way to tell is to do it twice to VNIs of the same batch while recording, and see how same the response is. Even the most potato player will have variation in their response.
---
Fair fair.
---
On a different note and not arguing here. My ex was able to find a place in Vancouver using airbnb that ended up being like $800 a month. Problem was it was with 5 other roommates. All dudes haha. But that's what you need to do when you get placed a province away for your practicum
---
I was lucky enough to get a house in a small town that I don't pay any rent to live in. All I have to do is look after it and make sure the rats, spiders, and snakes don't take over more than one room. Deadly snakes have made it into my room on a few occasions but they take one look around and leave as they don't want to live/hunt in those sort of conditions.
---
Australia haha?
---
holy shit do you live on the fucking moon?
---
Do you happen to have a written guide for this? A 20 minute video is not easy to use when trying to find pertinent information for specific missions.
---
But you have fun while doin it right?
---
I dont hang out in havens or sanctums so i doubt ill die to your boson.
---
But how will he get attention if he does that?
---
I agree with this. The AFKer is a sitting duck waiting to be killed.  I have an issue when you’re AFK-ing and using Near. That should be an exploit. You may as we’ll be a bot. If your AFK there should be risk.
---
You log off in the site so when you log in you warp back into the site almost immediately. There is almost no reaction time for the person/bot in the site.

Saving as a PDF would be better.  Multiple pages, easily do it from chrome, and can still search.

Paging /u/opus_congelatio.
---
You shouldn't be able to anchor these things under the guns of a keepstar. And yeah a full half hour ref timer is too much.
---
Cynos are too strong and need looking at, as well, but it should be done in a way which is balanced for both sides.
---
Keep yourself safe, spodlet.
---
Except they really haven’t. And the Forbes article didn’t even get the total money raised right.
---
Yes
---
better play elite dangerous .  lol
---
What are you even talking with f2p?
---
That has nothing to do with eve being p2w. Eve was p2w the moment plex came into play and even more so when skill injectors released.
---
You're acting like smartbombs and bombers make supers immune from bubbles. If there's even one semi competent dictor pilot bubbling your super you're going to be hard pressed to get it off of you with no subcap support, especially since the nsa changes.
---
That's good news, used to be on cal mil for several years. Was a lot of fun and flew with some great ppl. Kinda all fell apart when gal mil steam rollered everyone last year. Nice to see the militia making a recovery.
---
I am not even playing the game anymore (for now) but excuse me what? That sounds completely stupid
---
Just shoot the thing and decline the missions that make you shoot the two things. Only accept Hubris, Lethal Strike and Reprisal. Pick up 10+ of these missions per puller and zap them with a speedy ship.
---
You call them an "elite coalition" but I see them mostly bringing T1 trash fits while Electus Mataris is bringing coherent BS fleets with T2 logi support. 
---
Do you have any more background on the corp history? You really gotta flesh out the backstory in order to season the drama well when dealing with lesser known, or newer alliances or organizations.
---
Or is in delve with supers
---
[removed]
---
Why not just troll the bots by leaving your alt cloaked up in a safe spot all day? Eventually the bots with either start to ignore them in which case EZ kills are EZ or they won't be able to rat. Win-win.
---
All I see here is crying about the game not going on their favor cuz cyno jammers....
---
I recorded the mass self-destruct at the end: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxSpORQor9Q
---
&gt; Just shoot the thing
---
I see you've already read the extra-abridged version.
---
I was in HC briefly a while ago.
---
90 percent were afk miners/alts and the rest ganked.
---
There's way too few hunters out there to kill all the bots on a frequency to put them out of business. 
---
Also killing bots is even more boring than killing actual people ratting or mining. 
---
People in small gangs usually seek fights. Of course they snack an occasional vni if they can but that's usually not their main reason to undock for a roam.
---
Wouldn't it be nice if CCP said thank you by creating some kind of security alliance, and providing bot hunters with resources to kill botters!
---
It's HOT DROP O'CLOCK
---
CCP revert this nonsense, please. This is the most anti QoL change I've seen in a good while.
---
Already jumping to conclusions before release are we?
---
I like using a mach or domi myself. It's quite fun having a gunboat with a drone bunny slave alt. Yeah ticks are a bit lower than a carrier and vni or even a carrier alone sometimes but it's a lot more fun. If you want to rat in something else you just have to find what works for you. Just be aware though that many sites will just eat you if you aren't tanked properly and a lot of the lower level variants eat drones for breakfast.
---
Part of why the vni excels in addition to cost is the very low sig combined with high speed and the fact that drones aren't prioritised by the battleship rats that so commonly occupy the highest tier sites. Try running a vni in a hidden rally point though and om nom nom your drones are eaten
---
&gt;If there is no standing fleet on the other side, and you have super/titan superiority both on grid and in total number, 
---
Yeah that's rare. Like theres no such thing as spies to let an enemy know supers have been pinged and are incoming by gate. With long warp tunnel times due to TiDi and bumping mechanic's, that's a defender's buffet. How else do you get a Komodo kill?
---
mango will have to reset their bots first week in
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
spicy
---
It would be, if we were the first ones to batphone, may be. However, it rarely is. Usually we field similar number or higher on our own, people also assume "that is SNUFF, they have 50 more dreads on standby" and batphone to adjust for that.
---
tl:dr: you don't read =\]
---
And this game out since when ? Yep 14 years, this meta is out since when ? Yep 3/4 years
---
Even without injector it would be the same, maybe you won't see those dumb supers/titan with horrible fit and skill dropping around but we would have the same result after so long time
---
Ironically
---
Yo real talk. I just recently separated from my old corp.
---
I love wormholes and I’ve always wanted to try FW. 
---
 I’m seriously considering making a Caldari state FW corp based in wormholes.
---
I’ve always disagreed with this philosophy.  I could pay RL money for plex, but why trade something of value in real life for what I can get for pretend money in game?
---
Only one of these things can pay your bills in real life, only one generates interest in retirement accounts.  So many more important things can be bought with real money than a subscription to this game..
---
Work those 4 hours and pay off your student loan debt that much faster... and instead find a way to make isk in game that doesn’t require you sitting at a computer for hours at a time grinding isk.
---
play for free for a better RL financial outlook!
---
Is this confirmed as not real, and if so, where is the proof?
---
You must be a prophet. Because you say things no one ever said or written and yet assume them to be true...
---
According to SNUFF leadership - they had little choice. Changes to low-sec, to meta, to ingame-politics, whatever. 
---
I'd joined SNUFF to kill off Goons. I take pride in my hatred to anything bee-shaped in this game, and openly despise mitts and his croonies. And had been very vocal about it all over the place. I, and many others, did not take part in Delve part of the thing and managed to onjy join 2 battles total for the Imperium - the Keepstar ones. The only time we were given no choice on the matter (yep, in the entire year in Imperium we done fuck all for the coalition, fighting our own little wars on the other side of the galaxy). We left the coalition soon afterwards (coincidentally). 
---
A lot of people see the game as "fuck politics, hate whoever you wanna hate, shoot the primaries". 
---
I lot of armchair strategist or political consultants on reddit, who knows it all about every alliance out there, better then even the memebers of that alliance. But when it comes down to it, most are just as f1-monkey as myself. I just dislike people who talk trash just because they believe in it, regardless of any facts.
---
Holy shit
---
The Frat Ihub was the only time I've seen these in action, and I think also the only time a major fight broke out around them. That was a very fun fight, going on for about 5 hours straight with constant sub-cap brawls, and it would have gone on longer if Tapi had more Chinese allies, which they just got. 
---
Just based on that fight I'm saying that these were a very good change, although I suppose having a spy corporation to anchor a bunch of them throughout the target constellation isn't going to be a common occurrence, and it will be a bit different when its attackers trying to take them offline.
---
So different from null sec in that 90 % are afk ratters.
---
It looks good, but I'm not sure why they keep doing (and re-doing) gate animations that look absolutely fine when there are plenty of other art assets that are in serious need of an update.
---
As I was assured in the other thread - SNUFF only fights when we have the entire east on batphone, never ever taking any fights where are not not assuredly superior. Obvious fake. People on reddit know better.
---
Yeah this legit pisses me off. Who the hell remembers what comes after FD- or P-F or 7Q- or 7-Q......
---
When the only way to offensively take space is to let NPCs do it for you, you know EVE is \_actually\_ fucked.
---
If every single major null block got together and called open season on bots, and open season on anyone harboring them, it would  potentially make a huge difference. Can speak from experience being part of NC. that when I found a person botting and reported, they got kicked out rapidly. (alas i failed to kill them, bit of a derp on my part)
---
Well this is super frustrating :( paha
---
I agree with your statement but good luck getting Eve the to that, last time all of Eve clusterfucked on someone it was against goons and that was someone paying ridiculous amounts of ISk
---
Exactly this. Makes catching those bots fucking difficult. Unless they're shit bots and you have worked out their automated warp route, which is hilarious.
---
From what I've seen the script recalls the bots. They don't do much to try and escape.
---
jEVE assets will show you what's in it
---
It most certainly does. But space is huge and CODE. isn't everywhere.
---
Snuff makes it so if you make it any bit of trouble for them or try to set down any fort/azbel/refinery they will drop caps and sometimes titans, they also will drop rorqs/archons on prophecys @adversity
---
Been waiting for alliance / fleet temporary bookmarks for 10 years.   
---
Bug fixes a really useful "bug" and says fuck you.   
---
Please revert this. Everyone who hunts uses the 1st 3 chars to find systems....
---
It's a play off the phrase "they brought everything, including the kitchen sink." Basically a fleet of random, and sometimes unexpected or out of meta ships.
---
An example would be a Drake, Vagabond, Augoror, Heron, Cynabal, Vindicator, Megathron, Condor and a Maller. Totally random, doesn't make any sense.
---
I'm not quite sure what's going on... Are they running T1 canes and no logi meme praxis fleets into somewhat meta T1 battleship comps and being surprised that they lose?
---
For the pride and accomplishment
---
All the scraps left from regular doctrine fleet, put together
---
It means a fleet with no composition, absolutely anything goes. You can mix together armor cruisers, shield battlecruisers, hull tanked battleships, and sometimes capitals. There is usually not much logi since everyone just wants to zerg shit.
---
A fleet without a specific doctrine.
---
If logi is present the ship will predominantly be tanked for it, but not always. Sometimes you get weird mixes of shield and armor, self and remote rep ships all together.
---
A gang of whatever ships each individual wanted to bring and not some strict doctrine. Not all kitchen sink gangs are terrible abominations with brawling battleships and crap support, plenty of good groups roam pretty much exclusively in `kitchen sink`, they just know what kind of ships slot into the gang.
---
Thank you for all the amazing responses, i now have regained brain cells thanks to the kind capsuleers of this sub
---
I just kinda retired from null and am actually watching that HC-events... srsly, there are EVE-players fighting over systems, with "borders" that are not regions away, but within the same constellation. Fighting over control/access to ressources with whatever ships they got at hand. Smack is gettin talked, things get blown up. Thats more EVE than I ve seen in null for a whole while.
---
Is there anything to consider if I’m about to make a sell order for a amount that’s over 20% of the daily sell quantity of Jita?
---
Like should I split it into smaller sell orders, at different prices? Sell with a alt? This is the first time I’ve dealt with this big a order to get rid of.
---
They clearly know best, because their current course of action has been so successful...
---
Wait, no, they failed like 5 projects in a row, introduced F2P, and almost went bankrupt before being forced to sell out to a Korean cashgrab company and metrics are still going down.  \\o/
---
Adding: Times where even big fleets been kitchen-sink have been fun. "Just bring whatever you have that is shield-tanked and can keep up with X m/sec". Loved it :)
---
No its one astra on the KS grid thats TZ tanked just like the fort.
---
CVA got caught about 275km off the Fort. They warped their whole fleet there and sat while the Fort repaired. Then they got bubbled. 
---
Unsure what their plan was
---
That’s the point of a kitchen sink right? It’s undefined, whatever’s in the hangar!
---
I mean, you can see the endgame of what happens when most people do start botting, just look at Serenity.
---
Its more that GalMil just gave up and fucked off.
---
Skill extract the 1.8M SP/month on your off accounts.  Once they have the necessary skills, you don't need to keep grinding their SP.  Its only like 200-400M per account.  Adapt or die.
---
its not even hard.  Once the alts have the SP you can extract it all
---
It's actually quite nice to fight in smaller LS or even HS wars where you're basically shooting at your neighbors for all eternity. Not blobby as all hell most of the time either, but there's still a lot of BS with wardecs that really tampers the fun.
---
I think the whole thing is probably fake. But I couldn't pass up the joke.
---
Now if only you needed that many corpses to put that skin on the ship
---
A fleet in which there is no defined doctrine but rather a loose set of guidelines that your ship should adhere to. For example, a "Kitchen Sink Shield" fleet would be expected to be shield tanked to match up with the shield boosts and reps somebody else is bringing, while a "kitchen sink nano" would be expected to be fast in order to run away quickly, but there is no expectation on anything else outside of the minimal level of synergy required to fight whatever you're expecting.
---
CCP is well know for repeatedly trying retarded shit that doesn't work.  See:  Every game they've made that's not EVE.
---
you can have extra omega'd accounts for around 200-300M per month, you just have to extract it.  This would be an easy adaptation for him, he's just unwilling to do it from the sound of it.
---
Good to know. About how big are their fleets?
---
Honestly, if you want to fly something other than a gila then you're  probably gonna need to be able to hit buttons and actually fly your ship.
---
Sacrilege is a solid choice! An economical fit can easily run t3/t4s
---
Sure, [It's here.](https://www.deviantart.com/ashlerb/art/Unfinished-Nidhoggur-Picture-704025540) I made it ages ago - it was going to be for some propaganda but our Hakonen deployment didn't last very long so I never finished it. =P
---
Are they really redoing the NPE again?  This is like the 5th time in a couple years they've wasted resources doing so, yet they never touch on the stuff that \*actually\* hurts new player retention.
---
[https://youtu.be/WYSo2rzqmZ8](https://youtu.be/WYSo2rzqmZ8)
---
t1 frigate, t1 destroyer, t3 destroyer, t1 cruiser, drake, t1 logi frig, t2 logi frig.
---
any combination of the above; except the drake. the bait drake is mandatory.
---
&gt;hit buttons and actually fly your ship.
---
That's fair. TBH Gila is just... Meh. Trying to find some entertaining pve and drone boats never really scratch that itch for me.
---
I've seen that the sac is also used at T5s so it's pretty reliable. Do they need HAMs or HMLs? Only have T2 HMLs and RLMLs.
---
If you are looking for entertaining pve you should play a different game
---
Fair. Lol.
---
create VNI killing bots?
---
Traitor? Goonfleet shot first.
---
Ugh. Last time I logged in the Gila was absolute shit.
---
Same.
---
I come back and there's VNIs and Gilas everywhere
---
One thing in common though - they all have a cyno fitted
---
Definitely want hams.. You need the dps to clear sites of t4/5
---
NC dock
---
every time something like this gets posted, some Goon screams "its not our job to police botters. we're not gonna do CCPs job for them." I wonder why that is their reaction?
---
Cerb is also a good ship for higher tier sites
---
I took a year off from being a line cook and now they have emotions. This is horseshit.
---
Plumbing for bringing in the kitchen sink?
---
You would need HAMS, as well as double web or web + tp and one, if not two reppers. So its a lot of buttons. I think your best bet is a vagabond and swapping its layout based on site choice. Leave your prop and invuln on, then use guns/repper and maybe damage control.
---
Possibly the only time someone has ever said this about r/eve!
---
For those of you downvoting because grr, his point is that zkill, or brinyourspace, or whatever else may come along, won't be around forever.
---
Are selling for a profit, eg station trading, or are you selling to get rid of it? 
---
In the case of the latter, just list it all. 
---
For the former, splitting can help if you want to 0.01 isk and have lots of separate orders you can adjust more frequently than a single order. Whether that's worth the effort to you, idk.
---
Yeah I'm hoping a bunch get killed, and at the same time wishing I'd bought more of them when GalMil was dominant. Only got about 1170 of them, should have borrowed isk for another two thousand hulls.
---
Pretty much any HAC, vni, phantasm and even a caracal if you have enough skill points and know what you are doing
---
is that something an automoderator type reddit bot could do? find all the old posts and make a new comment with a fixed link?
---
I enjoy pvp, but pve / isk making is more of "gotta do it" thing.
---
Is this thinly veiled CSM propaganda?
---
I can't see ratting in the triglav cruiser/hac being terribly efficient. You need a minimum 3 minutes for max ramp on the hac and the starting bade damage is like 300-400dps which is fairly low compared to say a Gila that's pushing out 800dps all the time
---
Isnt it everthing BUT the kitchen sink? Unless thats just aussie translation.
---
You are my hero
---
It’s a lot of PI material, I would like max profits.
---
I was being sarcastic to counter the-guy-above's point
---
Haha fair enough!
---
Hmm, do you have a link to their response? Or was this via a bug report?
---
apparently at the start of Revenge of the Sith the space battle has everything including a kitchen sink. one of the explosions is a sink exiting a star destroyer that the CGI team thought was funny to do.
---
CCP should just hire squizz to develop the official ccp killboard
---
I can agree with what you said, you certainly have added nothing to conversation either. There are soo many things you're leadership could have done, no, join the blob and win. The only reason why snuff gets all the shit they do is because you lot usually try to say its not blobbing when it clearly is. You can blob all you want, most don't give a fuck, its the spin shit that makes people think bad of you. 
---
If there is one thing goons have snuff don't, that is balls to admit their shit and just do, except for the special snowflake mittens/gsf leadership, whom likes to spin everything.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

---
Phantasm can clear electrics like nobody's business, kite ishtar I've had success with in 4s but the damage to drones is a serious issue with any drone boat other than the Gila. Sacrilege is a reliable 4-5 if you don't suck and have skills. I've tried Deimos, can't recommend. Vagas work but not my thing. For just 3s though literally any hac or pirate ship would work and some cruisers well fit.
---
FD-MLJ and PF-346?
---
They just said that
---
Hah, I said the same thing to a Frat guy I popped last night. For a moment I felt a little guilty to catch a live human, but we are at war.

Southern California
---
ya nothing elite about HC, they've been around awhile and accept everyone. It's like a community corp
---
While I'm not against skill injectors, I think they should definitely be nerfed, the intention was to help people catch up. Either a cooldown period, and/or make the diminishing returns even more punishing (say 150ksp at 40m sp instead of 80m, or even lower).

Instructions unclear, dick stuck in elevator

Gotta love a good bacon fry. They once wardecced us to hit a highsec structure, saw a friend ally into the war, and came to the next bash with two tech one BC and \*six\* neutral logi. Holy shit risk averse, Batman.
---
When we ran off a later attempt at another structure, they then tried various times to extort us, and to use a random swarm of alpha coercers and such to hit the structure in the hope we'd not bother turning up, even though a single character was enough to send them running.  
---
Nothing of value will be lost.

no, I do understand it, that's why I'm complaining, obviously the "roll" or whatever is biased towards underperforming, I've been doing T2 research for many years in Eve online, and I'm telling you from experience that normal probabilities don't perform like this over time... everything should even out, but it doesn't

No you see, it's statistically higher to get tons of failures for things you waste decrypters on. It's also statistically higher to get tons of successes on garbage you don't really care about. However, just because you get successes on garbage you don't care about doesn't mean it doesn't count.

Basically stop being poor and eat the losses without complaining

this is what happens when the provi market has nothing on it due to the fact people in apoc buy out all the supplies and put a huge markup on them. Its really fucking sad, its just a bunch of industrialists taking advantage the small folk trying to grind isk or content....also when I left I had to check but the black market is better stocked then the keepstar makes you wonder

if you're roaming in kitchen sink with regularity and success, you're roaming meta and pushing piloting skills.

&gt; I can stop a rape
---
Yes, you can, if you know its going on its not that hard to stop.  Turns out all you need is a wee bit of a spine.

yeah that seems like the only way to know for sure
---
It's very simple you have no need to say " FC can I dring my drake"
---
The price is set when it is moved to safety. Then it is updated when you open the can and take something out. That's personal experience.
---
Any swingin dick could give you a fit for those, not hard. Also like asking an indy nerd what they make money on. If you REALLY want to kill it, find a fit that reliably does t5 fires. They are so cheap you will be stupid rich.

unlike botting where i have no ability to stop it. only ccp can do that.
---
Do at least 10,000 runs, record all the success/failure and compare it to the % odds. I guarantee it will be pretty close. You can't look at such a small sample size and call the game broken because it didn't give you exactly 4.8/10.

Keep in mind that the bots don't usually reship right away, for now, so it takes them out of commission for a while. Even if they do reship you can just kill them again and again until they run into supply issues.
---
Can you post an example of a "hateful" fleet ping? I don't really doubt what you're saying, nor do I really care if your feelings were hurt, but I'm curious as to what you consider "hateful".

So like a Titan?

Seems like EM, PNO, and Nano are eating bacon at this point, using the salt to cure.

Just to clarify: Phoenix Naval Operations didn't "fold into" EM. They joined the alliance temporarily because of the convoluted war dec system.

You can report it, like you would hopefully report a crime you passed.  Like this isn't hard, you're currently trying to argue that you're the type of person who wouldn't interfere with a rape so you're justified in not reporting botting.

Are you sure this is the hill you want General Custer?

Ah right, thanks

have you ever hunted ratters before

This is comedy. So you say it WOULD have been helpful? Then get this guy an upvote and watch for current reports!
---
Can't comment on posts older than 6 months from what I know.

sure - but we're not talking about reporting things you chance upon.
---
people are saying that we, paying customers, should actively go out of our way to do a job that isn't ours.

&gt;you're currently trying to argue that you're the type of person who wouldn't interfere with a rape so you're justified in not reporting botting.

i'm really not.
---
Holy shit, so people actually do play this game in hisec.
---
I don't know many of the people in those groups but there were a couple of people I liked when we were assisting them with some stuff over a yeara go (Rollaz, Halo's Girl, and someone else). Kind of interesting to see what passes for war in highsec nowadays.

This video contains way less screaming than I am used to on test videos

If Goons attack TEST IHUB.I'm sure TEST guys Will thanks CCP to give them the new jammer

Well they could go that far not allowing alphas to use VNI's ....

Killing ability to afk VNI will kill all those extra accounts.       /s

It’s always kitchen sink until there’s 64 Revs on your face...and another that’s got a wicked bounce and is 500km away.
---
a normal player usually has light drones with them at least ... a bot (from what i have seen so far), only has his heavy drones for the site

Self repping armor ass frigs with shield cruiser logi...the bane of oni’s everywhere :D

You mean you support your own advantage. When you're back to listening to Elo shove coke up his nose, hearing "10 more minutes guys" for 8 hours straight while you wait to drop on something you'll be singing a different tune.
---
if you ever switch from gila to another ship for Abyss , you will note how easy and effective gila was
---
true
---
When did they stop caring about bots? Bots were banned all the time during 2011-2013 days
---
I see it as having two definitions.
---
"I literally don't give a fuck what you bring, yes you can bring your Drake."
---
and
---
"We're forming armor/shield/bulkheads, but I don't care what you bring as long as it has the right tank"
---
Not sure why you'd give up tbh, VNIs are nasty. You can quite often frag atleast something when you get tackled.
---
This is what mar5hy is doing with 50 accounts or so. A retarded solution for a retarded problem.

CCP are complete morons. I have no idea how the people who work there make it to the office each day without walking off a cliff or falling into a sewer.

Yeah looks like it, he is very composed
---
That bomb run was a thing of beauty. That subcap fleet was on grid for like 30 seconds before just disappearing.
---
Huh, I always understood it as bringing a bunch  of random stuff you find in the kitchen sink after throwing various plates and utensils in it throughout the day.
---
Agree, if you choose ships based on what will complement and synergize with the rest of the fleet, that's not kitchen sink, it's a fleet comp.
---
:thinking:
---
CCPlz fix cyno jammers so we don't have to have all these subcap battles. PGL's excellent plan didn't work in IAS so nobody in all of eve is going to make progress in any war. Obviously these jammer mechanics mean fleets need to defend 18 jammers for 10 hours which is crazy, nobody wants to do that.
---
With old jammers at least you could log off dreads on the jammer and suicide to kill it, or log off FAX on the jammer to suicide defend it, in that old system the jammer always went down. Which meant attackers didn't rely on killing the i-hub to clear the jammer.
---
/S
---
&gt; Show me on the doll where we hurt you 
---
yep, he is retarded
---
How's that going? Free kills or docked bots?
---
The only reason any fighting happened was because the spy corp flipped them. If not for that there would have been 0 fights.
---
should thank him for the content tho
---
Usually when I run a kitchen sink fleet I get a random assortment of frigs, dessies, and cruisers. With one poor logi tasked with keeping them alive...
---
They fought us in PH for like half a year or so and where outnumbered pretty much every fight. Not outgunned, sure, but still they definitely took unfavourable engagements as well even though they very rarely fed.
---
Nice vid, that initial response is the dream when flying a Stuka fleet. Gf
---
He is not PGL
---
I'm not certain, but he mentioned that he's paid enough to make a hefty passive income when combined with SP harvesting.
---
If CCP don't take their heads out of their butts and do... something, I'm sure more people like him will appear with time. Mass AFK cloaking is arguably the only way to meaningfully fuck with krabs on a truly strategic level.
---
&gt;you've triggered very sensitive fanboys fam . Wait for wave of hate and suspicions 
---
Yep, he is retarded
---
Cyno Jammers should be changed to 3 per Constellation. Problem solved.
---
They use the same naming system in FW as well. Yesterday I saw a fleet of 3 ventures at the same Plex. Iguess bots love sharing rewards with one another.
---
Injectors fucked the game to a degree but the audience isnt large enough to support the game soly on cosmetics like dota.
---
He creates content for everyone near him.
---
&gt;kite ishtar I've had success with in 4s but the damage to drones is a serious issue with any drone boat other than the Gila.
---
Have you tried 2 geckos + 1 augmented Wasp. They have plenty of speed, tracking and shield buffer. Although you still need to be careful with drone battlecruiser spawns.

I think it's used to confuse the enemy.
---
I was flying through some hisec systems going to the next lowsec pocket and i saw a mach bumping an orca. Sensing a gank coming i tethered up to the athanor and tabbed out. I tabbed back in 20m later and he was still bumping the orca and they were like 300km off. In the end the mach was like "yeah showed you, that's why you don't afk noob" and then left.

I just don't even know what to say.

Thats accurate for most people venturing to Stain.

I believe it’s a Goku fleet.

It is more about fact how this ship can be **ab**used in terms of ingame mechanics.
---
Snuff aren't the only group to be weary of. You may have heard the Chinese players from Serenity server are planning on "invading", and setting lowsec as a base, and it's been speculated that some members may already have caps. Then you've got Domain Research who drops caps in/around Huola. 
---
I had a Sin solo drop my gang of 4 frigates the other day though, so if you've got your heart set on caps you can either join one of those groups or Bring Solo Back
---
Usually a random collection of ships that have no reason to be together (shield and armor fit) with weird weapon combos, usually shit fit/dual tanked, some will have prop mods and others not, occassionally logi will be present, other times not.
---
It's literally what you get closing your eyes and grabbing loads of ships out of a bag and putting them on the table..then opening your eyes and thinking 'What in the actual FUCK?!' and they just rolling with it.
---
Usually a kitchen sink fleet is intentionally ironic for fun (IE drunk roam, insurance fraud old now none-doctrine ships, a competition for who lives the longest etc) and sometimes it's never player corps that simply don't know any better OR it's the final defense before being overrun and they refuse to just wimp out and go down fighting
---
&gt;Once you have a foothold in the system, don't release control
---
There is no way to maintain control without a nonstop camp, and given how long you can draw out a 3 timer fight with days long timers it is completely impossible to maintain a hellcamp for that amount of time.
---
Thanks for the update, just came back to check lol
---
Cuz I have an alt in their company i knew those bot belong to whom .
---
Also I can see them crying in QQ msg group that was fun.
---
&gt;"What should we do when we find a blue botter? Report to CCP or report to diplo?"
---
&gt;You should probably not be reporting on your fellow goons because a lot of times we've had to deal with this before. People will see someone go, "Oh, they're totally botting, they're totally doing this" - We actually had a problem and we don't know if we've resolved this yet, but some self-righteous douchebad decided to report everybody that he thought was "multi-boxing", not even saying these guys were botting, it's just like "Oh my god, they're running multiple accounts, that's BAD!" and just like some uppity fuckin' Church lady, ran around and petitioned a whole bunch of his fellow goons because he felt that he knew best, and he felt that he could actually just look at a group of people doing something and judge individually as if they knew who was botting and who was multiboxing [note: not illegal] and who was good and who was bad.
---
&gt;That person is a piece of shit goon fucker traitor because you do not know what the other person is doing on the other side of their client. You do not know whether they are using [a multiboxing client] correctly or whether they are actually violating EULA, you do not know if the person who is mining in the belt with you in an anomaly.
---
&gt;Don't fucking report on your own people, don't be a self-righteous piece of shit, don't be that guy and I'm not gonna apologize for being a dick about that, Markus Hayabusa. That is a very dangerous kind of question that you have asked, you are not the judge jury or the executioner you do not get to decide what other people in your alliance are doing or not doing because you have no idea what's going on so
---
&gt; Also I can see them crying in QQ msg group that was fun.
---
share tears pls
---
You could make a program that does something as simple as "Left-Click" and hold, then brings mouse to the left or right at some set speed, in theory if you had consistent frame-rate that would make a completely uniform spin for as long as you wanted.
---
You could fairly easily do this in a language like "Autohotkey" which is mostly known for people making scripts to use in games, this would be perfect for something simple like this.
---
same thing happened a few years ago in amarr/min. the amarr were dominating for a long time and the minmatar groups dwindled so much that the amarr got bored, took fweddit to null and left a huge power vacuum. the few remaining min got some offensive momentum going and the plex bots switched over, which resulted in it taking about a week to completely flip the warzone and hit t5
---
i *still* have over a million lp left from that, 6 years ago
---
basically, if there's a dominant power on one side that's the whole reason they're in control and it gets too strong, eventually they'll get bored and go do something else, which usually results in a pretty immediate flip of the warzone
---
big enough
---
I tried download ing auto mouse but they dont "move gradualy". They jump from point A to point B so it doesnt help. Maybe i will try to code it myself i guess
---
Thera is a pretty cool place.
---
and atioth the only named system in geminate
---
There are two channels in game that have a bunch of fits, including a Phantasm one. "Abyssal Lurkers" and "Abyssal Lurkers 2"
---
to be fair when Im semi-afking (using the intelmap as alert system and watching youtube) my VNI also instantly aligns and warps out when local changes(or better I see local change). How would you know that Im an attentive player instead of a bot?  
---
Im not at all complaining about Pvp and I dont intend to, but how would you know difference?
---
o7 battleclinic, podbase, and eve-kill
---
probably my first 50 kills in eve i only posted to podbase, which died, and now they're gone forever
---
Google is your friend
---

---
VNIs don't have jump drives
---
It's not as difficult as it might seem, just do a lot of searching and also asking quesitons on forums and communities when you get lost. Here is the autohotkey forum if you have specific questions:
---
 [https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/)
---
You also want to consider looking into getting the mouse locked into the Eve window, if you can do this, potentially you could prevent the mouse movement from being jittery and jumping by forcing the mouse to stay inside the window and just keep going in one direction.
---
In some fashion it is content.
---
It also flood the market with cheaper stuff so that is good for ppl with low isk...

Would be awesome for ppl on a vacation to be able to run 24/7 until I get back home. Or simply when I sleep and work hmmmm....

Seddow's Mom has got it goin on.

And now it's suddenly a botting topic.

Botters attack spinning, the last refuge of the true human Eve player!

For a game that's supposedly about playing the way you want in this wide open sandbox, there sure is a really strong conformist streak out there.  
---
"Play this video game the way I think you should, or I'll make a post on reddit to tell everyone how shit you are."  
---
Says a lot about the OP, tbh. But probably not what he thought when he posted it.
---
I pay for the game I do wtf I want in game. If I want to report ppl to CCP for "botting" It is my duty to do so. Anyone saying differently can eat a big fucking turd.
---
Mittani can use his so called retoric and tell ppl not to but he don't own EvE.
---
if u think u see a bot u report it to CCP THE END.
---
What happened to your old Plex in storage from the past?
---
If people really think botting ship spinning is a problem, they really need to reevaluate what they value in this game.
---
I guess its just me then, i never found a way to make isk that i enjoy. At least not to make 1-2b just to burn it on the market for plex.
---
I'm bad at reddit, you should have a chat message, hope it's how it work :D
---
Take a deep breath. It's just a game.
---
The next step in boting behaviour ! Your bot is auto spinning ships when docked
---
🌀✨Thera!
---
Mittani should ask PLA’s CEO to ban those bots as well
---
Having an alt doesnt prevent you logging in the first account.
---
that will surely help you to overthrow MarkeeDragon's Top Tier Twitching warden.
---
Have been in HC for years - Ask me anything :D
---
How many runs have you done? If it's just one set of 10 rolls, then it's unlikely, but very possible. However, if you have done 100 rolls, then it's very very unlikely, and high likely something is probably off. If 300+ runs, then it's almost guaranteed something is off.
---
It is the only way ! If he can viewbot then I can spinbot ! Its time for a du...du...du...DUEL
---
Yeah.. no. We want to see what happened 10 years ago, not regress 10 years ago in terms of tech too.
---
Here is my Zealot fit I used for T4's. Did quite a few before finally losing it to a massive Entangling/Starving/Ghosting Triglavian spawn. Standard tactic is start orbiting the gate at spawn distance (or more if you need to pick off a few key targets like Anchoring Damaviks) and kite everything. Slow down a bit if needed to let enemies get within Scorch range (35-40km with the TC using a range script). Once sure you can tank everything, go for the loot and swap to dps crystals and TC tracking script. For T3's you can sacrifice some bling on the tank for more dps/cheaper.

So what you have to do is take a relatively big bowl. Than you have to put gummy bears in it. (Be careful: You have to use regular gummy bears, those that have a soft white layer on the bottom won't be good!) Than you pour vodka on them until it covers the gummy bear pile. Put it in the fridge and wait for a day. If you are a social drinker, don't eat more than 2-3 at a time. This shall solve most problems.
---
dont worry frat already pinged they are going on the offensive like 10 times.... theyll find out how broken the jammer are themselves... if they come... they must come
---
Bumpers do this for hours, either to drive miners out of the system or to simply to annoy them till they explode in rage.
---
The system mentioned above, Finanar was notorious for it a while ago. There were serveral dudes bumping miners in 8 - 12h shifts. I still remember this one dude who was bumping miners every day for like 10h ... totally insane.

Isn't that because they farmed enough VNI LP and now they want to strengthen their LP by lowering warzone control?

Hey i can sell you some "1 time use skins" to make you feel good over the bot/rorqual induced hyperinflation. Our one guy trying to balance the game (kill2) is kinda swamped currently but atleast you can look fabulous.

This is not a win against bots, its a victory of a company that sucessfully made their playerbase ignorant and acceptive (might aswell say devote) to shit mechanics and monetary driven objectives.

Outrage not celebration should be the path of this post.

Simply put he thought they might be botting so he reported it to the relevant people to investigate. So he did the right thing. Report anyone you think is botting to CCP.

People who just bump (and who don't gank) miners seemed like such weird people to me when i lived in hisec. Now that i've lived in null for about 6 months they seem even weirder. It seems like such a petty waste of time when you could go out and shoot people. I mean there was another orca in the belt, why not bump him off his augmented mining drones (the one being bumped only had t2 out) warp in a fleet of catalysts and either he pisses himself warping off leaving the drones or you gank him.
---
BYOB
---
It's not easy to hit a smal moving target with those damn things, i tell you!
---
Once it looked like i hit squarely but only got so many damage notifications, which weren't even that high. 
---

---
This was one of the typical one step forward, two steps back, things ccp always does with the QOL updates. Literally retarded

Also, fleet links are some unreadable shade of fucking purple. Nothing screams RORQ SAVE more than unreadable fucking purple.

Seems the NPE is good at producing armchar devs lol
---
&gt;Again your argument is flawed, you are proposing going into a contested grid when the enemy knows exactly where you are attacking, what gate you're entering and  when you are attacking and is also  perfectly pre-positioned. 
---
So sort of any non shield-timer on any citadel ever?

Its like a wallet skin

---
Are you too mittani and thus don't need evidence?
---
There was a carrier bot popular in KwG space that did exactly the same. Same behavior with fighters. 
---
It also was different that the few VNIs that used it used to safe up and cloak.
---
I see no proof at all, at least last time you were shitposting you at least put some 'evidence'.

Vagabond. You get into the site, activate your AB and shield booster, and from there on all you do is push F1 and F2 to kill stuff. With a pith x-type shield booster and a cap battery, you can pretty much brawl and facetank all waves.

assisted drones will attack the target you most recently activated an offensive module on. assisting drones does not give another player the ability to directly command your drones.

so if you had no offensive modules, then assisted drones will do nothing when commanded to assist you.

We try to avoid drama whereever possible and everyone can do whatever they want to but can always expect help from anyone in corp should you ever run into an issue/need help.
---
Noone is gonna get mad at you when you decide to jump to nullsec and live there. And should you ever decide that thats not for you then you are welcomed back without any issue, no matter if you are coming from a former enemy or not.
---
We recruit a lot of newbros and teach them the ropes before they move on to bigger alliances/nullsec.
---
Nothing, it is a long running joke. At some point we had an exchange of "legal" letters over the naming here. Good times.
---
For t3s reliably I use HAMs + MWD + dualrep in electricals (only cap stable with everything running in electricals, drop MWD for AB if running any other filament), I do like to go HML + AB sometimes in other filaments because HAM range and AB speed is pretty grim. 
---
Anything over t3 you want HAMs exclusively though.
---
You never seen a bomber like this before? How are these not a thing where you live? I mean I can not think of a reason why not to have a few around just in case, even in small scale engagements.
---
Try Retribution solo in T3 Electrical Fleet Abyss :P 
---
i run them with a Beam Retri, 1mn ab and abyssal A-type repper rolled on max Hp
---
also mid grad asklepian set.
---
cost around 1,6b ... but you should return invest in under 10 sites, as you will loot 3times the stuff :D
---
enjoy
---
When I lived in Provi I remember Evan was always around in his dreads and carriers, creating content for us. Never got salty or shit talked, always seemed to enjoy the fights he got.
---
probably was in contract altogether
---
And ccp dont care about the bots XD

Can you share the codes for entering their qq if public?

I have some small same vials of Oxblood and Robert Oster Fire &amp; Ice! Goulet Pens has a cool thing where you can get random samples, or samples from a spectrum. I had a few I tried out and liked, and made an art with although it was way too consuming to constantly wash and change the inks to repeat.
---
Yama-Dori is beautiful and my first introduction to the concept of sheen. It's a midnight blue kind of ink, but with a surprising red sheen that makes it shine a brilliant violet to red. [This piece](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/410078147472785418/574904458623057920/IMG_20170924_191209_685.jpg) was one of the first works I did with my new fountain pen, and it really showcases that range of color. The "water" is the wet smear color, done with a wet finger. It works great for my everyday writing too.
---
Ah, it's killing me that I can't find my pen.
---
I don't care too much about highsec or the fighting entities. But this my friends is the way to get people interested in a situation. 
---
\- Show who is fighting who (with KB links)
---
\- Why is group A fighting group B (with Links)
---
\- give some inside into the minds of group A or B (discord leaks)
---
I really like it! For nullsec the reddit posts are mostly: TAPI is BEST, default PGL smackpost on discord, random insider memes no one else understands.   
---
Keep it coming!
---
You need some kind of offensive module to make the drones engage. It doesn't have to be a gun. Target painters, tracking disruptors and sensor dampeners also work among the various ewar/tackle.
---
Depending on who the npcs are aggro-ing, you can use the "guard" command, but if they change aggro your drones won't pick up on the change and will just go idle.
---
The system isn't super intuitive and it has some holes, but it does the job most of the time.
---
That said, CCPLS "RIGHT CLICK FLEET MEMBER/WATCHLIST MEMBER -&gt; ASSIST DRONES TO" option without having to find them in the assist menu over and over and over...
---
Ofc ... but i could assume that it makes still a difference if you have to sub for every bot, or if you can get it for free ...
---
well this is also true
---
were you log on trapping with the inty, or you jumped out and they immediately initiate warp back to the anom?
---

This seems like the solution to all your problem:

I wish you could hear my clapping.
---
I haven't played in a while, so I have two questions:
---
1. Do the refining skills affect refining ore in High Sec facilities? Or do they only affect refining in player-owned factories?
---
2. The new points given for activities. Do they do anything, or are they just achievements, like Playstation/XBox/Steam? I've gotten a couple now for mining, but don't see a use for them.
---
Nice work dude!
---
Agreed. Suitonia suggested that alphas shouldn't be able to use heavy drones to force these bots to use gilas, which are significantly more expensive. I really like that suggestion.
---
I throw my wirrless mouse in the dryer and put it at express.
---
Seriously did not know that, thanks.
---
Fuck this is genius
---
&gt;with a fking nestor
---
and with command dessie (links , mjd,  pack of elite ECM drones) . still impressive tho
---
Eh mostly self learned as my school was shot at helping me catch up. *Had problems learning English.*
---
&gt; I always am in awe about how chilled 
---
when you are playing video games for life, and specific game for like 10-12 hours a day it's really hard to be nervous about something.
---
No joke, I unsubbed all three of my accounts when PA bought EVE. Fuck Pearl Abyss.
---
When you have someone added on your watchlist you can just assist that way. No need to look through the entire list.

That'd guarantee a killboard forever, much like the official wiki.... uhm.

---
welcome to the "dicks" club. i'm still playing solo tho ,so fuck you
---
I don't, that sounds incredibly myopic to me. It would kill alpha potential for many ships such as the Dominix, Armageddon, Myrmidon, etc. Moreover, forcing bots to move to Gilas doesn't change things, as they are still botting and making significant amounts of isk. It also affects player alphas heavily.
---
I doubt that suitonia really proposed that as a solution to botting, because if that was the entire statement then suitonia has no understanding of the nature of the problem.
---
I wish i cared about anything as much as you care about this videogame =//
---
Looking at it, in some ways, HS wars like this remind me of ... early phases of RTS games ala Supcom. Late game your able to make everything, and can go super optimized. Here people are more limited in resources, possibly skills, and people. 
---
The limitations mean each group has to figure out what they CAN do to do what they want. Rather then what they 'should'.

---
&gt; We try to avoid drama whereever possible
---
doesn't really seem that way. care to comment on the OP's claims?
---
Beautiful! Yeah, looks a lot closer to Fire &amp; Ice than Tranquility in that shot. Tranquility is more green. They've both got a gorgeous red sheen to them, though.  
---
Most of my use case is writing - I keep journals of my work - which is why I love Oxblood. It's understated enough that it can be used professionally, but interesting and beautiful enough that I can still enjoy looking at it. Also, it's great when your pen leaks and your coworkers suddenly think you have bloody napkins all over your desk. I definitely frightened our team's GM a few months back. ;)  
---
But yeah - love Goulet. Though, their random samples are just the fountain pen equivalent of buying a loot box. ;)
---
There is no solution to botting. When devs propose an interface to act servers, there are people who will game that interface. The more energy devs put into anti-bot measures, the more energy botters put into anti anti-bot measures and it drains the energy out of the devs, thus slowly killing the game.
---
So all you can do it to reduce the impact of botting. That is, by making it less and less interesting, and if possible while making the game as interesting for non botters.
---
An example is to have legal money exchange operations managed by the devs (i.e. buy plex for money)
---
Another obvious example is to NOT have free2play offer that is easily abused by botters. So either no F2P (too late …) OR F2P offer that is limited in its capacity to kill the game.
---
At least the shield extender was proper, though usually not part of the fit anyway....
---
But that involves work ... unless bots can do that shit too :D
---
Thanks for explanation, quite a douchebag thing from him.

Not really. I could say things like Brave and Horde, but honestly I´m a believer that a smaller group would be more efficient. You know the people, they really get to know you, and like this you really learn how to do things by just smalltalking, and not get pushed into a doctrine.
---
Best to just post in the official Forum that you´re looking for a Corp, tell what you are looking for, and talk to those who message you. I personally never join a group that has more than 20 people, but then again, I´m more focused on WH gameplay
---
A true Gentleman then.
---
It was kinda entertaining and believable, until he refused to sell big stuff to legit good offers
---
&gt; drains the energy out of the devs, thus slowly killing the game
---
That's not how any of this works. The game is not powered by the mental energy of devs alone and it is not necessarily boring for anti-bot measures to be developed.
---
More nuanced and dynamic PvE systems are a huge step the devs have passionately taken, and the community has loved. Pushing that forward and changing the very nature of PvE to one more inherently interesting of a problem is a huge step forward. The security team is also working hard and passionately. There are no technical faults with the servers or lack of progress parity that indicates the devs are pushed to breaking points they cannot meet, and they are sincerely appreciated for their efforts even if we complain when they miss the mark.
---
It is the playerbase where we are seeing a dissatisfaction and steady dropping off of activity, especially of casual players who find it harder and harder to subsist in an economy where faucets run wide open and sinks are choked by risk aversion.
---
On the other hand, while I do not agree that an RMT market and removal of alpha is a good primary solution, as it would fundamentally make EVE into a game with focus on wealth generation and cut off a huge portion of remaining and potential playerbase, it is nonetheless something that to some degree addresses the impact as you propose. That solution of removing heavy drones for an entire class of players because bots happen to use them completely misses their target.
---
Leaving provi and crying about badly stocked market, while being right next to high sec.. *eyesroll*
---
when is windsigh going to face consequences for his continuous disregard for rule 11?
---
Tdil boasting about killing evan is cool. Provi dudes, we're elite now!
---
The praxis fleet had  6-7 guardians or so. we opted to ignore them.   the first cane fleet warped down without thier logi on accident. they came back and we took the bhaals instead. That fleet had about 8 execs.
---
Is there a way to find the valuable things in the lost and forgotten items a returning player has spread all over the universe? My character profile shows a "worth," but how do I find the gems in that amount?
---
Obviously someone called "Kcfghnhtgh Pappotte" must be legit
---
will work for bacon. :D
---
&gt;  The game is not powered by the mental energy of devs alone and it is not necessarily boring for anti-bot measures to be developed
---
Yes it is. The energy devs can bring in the game is limited. The required amount of energy to provide is more than linear (eg quadratic) with the work that actually takes place, because the addition of dev time does not result in the addition of work result.
---
I don't think they ought to be able to use heavy drones, but also probably not faction ships either. Alpha status should either be for trying to game out or playing it casually; you shouldn't be able to fly the mainstream ratting ships and print isk nearly as well as a dedicated alt.
---
And the fact that that would make botting bans stick far better would be a big bonus.
---
He MaKeS OuR KiLlBoArDs LoOk BaD!?!
---
I no Evan for 5 y and its his sandbox. He enoy it in his way. And when i quit EvE his gona get all my shit so he can loose another 300 caps.
---
&gt; It would kill alpha potential for many ships such as the Dominix, Armageddon, Myrmidon, etc. in a manner antithetical to the purpose of the alpha program. 
---
I guess the question is, what is the purpose of the alpha programme? It surely isn't to enable anyone to play Eve for free, because then no-one would pay for it.
---
Don't forget that not so long ago there was no F2P at all, and Eve is still at its core a subscription game. I don't think it's the intention for alphas to be able to replace omegas for everything except cloaking and multiboxing.
---
Ouch.
---
&gt; I strongly disagree with the base assumption that if it does not completely solve the problem, then it is not worth doing, and recent dev efforts have agreed.
---
That's definitely not what I said.
---
What I said is that you can't expect the devs to keep up with the bots. KEEPING UP would required a massive energy/money and the game would not be able to provide innovation, which in turn would make the player base not play it.
---
The COST of fighting the bots is too expensive for a game company to pay it all.
---
Oh was there already a post? Can you link
---
That would be the Fit that I use for Lv.4 and 5 Dark sites without much problems, unless I´m really unfortunate and have an extreme neuting Leshak fleet. As ammo use faction or T2 (for BS) Explo for Triglavian, and EM for everything else

How much 'dev energy' you think was invested in current citadel/sov mechanics?
---
&gt;  casual players who find it harder and harder to subsist in an economy where faucets run wide open and sinks are choked by risk aversion.

Casual players is not alpha players. for casual players nothing has changed.

Yes any time I need something why don't I travel the 10-20 jumps depending on what trade hub I go to all the while dodging pirate which is exactly what they tell us not to do with cva toons. Also let's forget about some of the people that like doing invention and building stuff no fuck them if I can save 20million going to highsec. Get over yourself mate don't pretend like I'm not right and deflect with your nonsense.
---
The purpose is to provide new players with access to content, and give them a proper taste of EVE so they can commit further. It's like, an actual F2P program. One month trial was judged too limited to let people properly try stuff like nullsec fleet content or even really learn what's going on. A Domi that cannot launch heavy drones is not a proper taste of EVE and also disproportionately slants experience on racial preference.
---
Personally, I think the alpha program itself could stand to be adjusted in some ways, but that is a different issue.

Assuming you are specifically referencing the Pastebin - looks like someone getting dramatic after losing some structures and others calming him down rather than feeding it.  What would you call it?
---
Fighting bottling, or any exploit is the price of running a MMO.  Like server maintenance or fixing bugs.  It is money and time well spent.  
---
While it’s impossible to completely get rid of, if a company ignores this kind of thing it is cancer for the game.  It eats away at player morale and the economy of the game.
---
You can set desto via dotlan as well ....
---

This exactly. And lately we are seeing the economy and morale pay.

put the small drones on assist on a precision-support ship (target painter, webifier) to kill small rats.

raven does not need to be assisted but by sentries. to reduce idle delay of sentries, add a painter on the raven and it will allow sentry to switch target while the last rack of cruise is ending its cycle.

Time to chill and use those things that clutter your inventory.
---
you love the attention &lt;3
---
This is a copy / pasted message, but fell free to answer it if you have any questions.
---
First of all, take the time to do the career agent missions. It will show you many things in the game (exploration, mining, industry, hauling, etc).
---
Then, well Eve is a sandbox, so you will need to figure out what you want to do. As a new player, you are not strictly limited, but what ever you do, Eve can be dull and boring, mechanics are complex at first because of the amount of informations you need to learn but once you understand them it's generally a lot easier. What ever you want to do, try to have fun or enjoy the complex interactions mechanics are creating, so basically don't grind isk for the sake of grinding isk.
---
- Want to explore the stars alone ? Buy an exploration frigate, a cloaking device and go around the stars looking for data and relic sties. Maybe join a wormhole corp and enjoy space where frontiers change everyday, and need scanning on a daily basis. There are some newbie friendly wormhole corps that can teach you the way of Bob.
---
- Want to join one of the large nullsec empire ? Join TEST, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet or Brave. They are all well known newbie friendly corporation/alliance and they will give you free ships, a place in fleet, and people are generally willing to teach you. They also offer good opportunities for new players to make isk (exploration and salvaging mainly).
---
- Overwhelmed by large organizations but still want to join an active PvP corp ? Try and look for a small faction warfare corp or alliance, there are plenty of them and they will also guide you, get you a place in fleet and you will enjoy endless content.
---
- Want to settle in a bit more in "security" ? Run some combat mission in HS. But try not to do that, really.
---
- Want to become the space Rockefeller ? Look into market, region trading, and all the shit. You won't blow space ships but if you enjoy raw data, data analysis (like, real data analysis) this is your thing. Isk revenue is potentially infinite.
---
- Want to mine rocks and turn them into modules, ships, ammunition ? Start mining and industry. Pro tip, don't do it alone in HS you don't have a single chance, join Goons (= Karmafleet), nullsec have way more valuable ore and Goons are basically the safest most organized industry in the game. You can also join some renter corp but that's up to you.
---
- Want to build your own corp ? Build it with some friends, maybe to do industry, or PvE, or PvP. My 5 isk : FW is a really good way to make isk and have some fight for new players. Low class WH can also be interesting.
---
A short list of advice :
---
- [This is your bible](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page)
---
- Right clic EVERYTHING.
---
- Eve is a sand box, figure out what you want to have fun doing and don't bother what other thinks. There is no right way to play Eve.
---
- Faction do not matter. Pick one you feels seems cool and then ignore it for ever since you can fly any ship of any faction without any difference.
---
- Eve is also a dangerous game. Don't use ships you can't afford to loose. Both players and NPCs can wreck you quite fast, even later in the game when you will fly big expensive ships.
---
- People will kill you. No matter where you are, people can and will kill you, even in high security space. HS is actually the worst place to be, because you think everyone is friendly when it's really not the case. Outside, it's a lot more easier, everyone is your enemy.
---
- The very same people that will kill you can also be the same people that will explain to you why you died if you ask them. People in the game are generally friendly and don't mind teaching new players.
---
- Don't get attached to your ships.
---
- Eve shine when played with other people. Don't be afraid of recruitment policies, knock at the door, join a corp, have fun with others.
---
- Learn of your mistakes, don't get angry. If you died, it's your fault.
---
- r/evenewbies it's a good place to ask stupid question. r/evejobs it's a good place to look for a corp.
---
You can report people if they bump you just to troll you. Of course we're talking about CCP here and it's highly unlikely they'll do anything but it is against the rules.
---
same , I am amuzed.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfMYh9SESXg
---
This question is asked really often here :)
---
You should give it a try, i am fairly new also (compared to the age of EVE i mean) and i can only recommend it.
---
"Expansions" are free plus&gt;&gt;&gt; the alpha clone state is free so you can't have a good try and even stay alpha if you want to.
---
About the pointers : there is your part of the job, and a difficult one in Eve &gt;&gt;&gt; find want you want to do in the game!
---
google is your friend and the Uni Wiki site is also great for any kind of informations.
---
this post was bearely "meh" but you two made it fun :)
---
How about Structure updates, with Citadels going from Medium sized Combat structures, Moon mining, Hisec moon mining (A different update.) Refineries, Engineering facilities , with small structures, player owned stargates, structure based cyno jammers, all updates with its own equipment, Including bomb launchers, burst projecters, standup fighters and more.  
---
Or Further back, Capital updates, Fighter changes, Rorqs being made useful again, Slowcat carriers gone, the birth of FAX etc etc.  
---
There's plenty of updates, you're just salty.
---
this is what will finally kill EVE
---
well shit, i guess my cover is blowned now
---
What’s your anti-bot ship of choice?
---
can't view pastebins at work, didn't read it

i wonder where OP is getting a lot of the assertions he's made about things like "elite" and "controlling high sec"
---
Ah yes, the planetary tractor beam. Sucks all the planets and moons in. Make camping PI haulers much easier.
---
But! Jumping to conclusions is half of our exercise program!

Forgot to mention it's literally just x minutes of work to fix anything in the game.
---
did you forget what we were talking about? We're talking about PvE additions to the game, not 'everything'.
---
Besides, that's a lot of words to say 'upwell structures' which (ask any content creator) are god awful all around.
---
Eve players in tyool 2019, ladies and gents.
---

---
If your entire argument is opportunity cost then you cant take it and leave it as you please. 
---
Ie: CCP puts 10,000 man hours in to an expansion and it is total shit... then they should have put that 10,000 man hours in to something that could improve the game...ie killing botting. 
---
You cant selectively use your argument.
---
Eve is nothing without heavy drone domis. Gotta have them heavy drone domis or may as well uninstall.
---
"bring anything you want, battlecruiser down" for example
---
Do they use random name generators for their corp names?
---
INIT Titan Pilots really gave beautiful display of Lances. Great show! and also I love Brisc &lt;3
---
there was not mention of opportunity cost in my argument. Focus on what I wrote, and stop making up words in my sentences.
---
I love that a vague elongated trapezoid with wings is so obviously a Niddy.
---
Don’t know how I feel about that as we are part of the coalition lol, I didn’t join PH or Goons for a reason even test, not a big fan of massive blobs, I know Brave is pretty big as well but not on the same scale, we have pretty quiet days too..
---
:eyes:
---
Medium sized engagement with even numbers of battleships on either side and no possibility for cap interference, looks like you guys are having a ton of fun and I love it. This is pretty much the ideal use case of the wardec system, as far as I can see.
---
GF mi amigo. I was annoyed I didnt get all of you good boosh to save those who didnt die.
---
Saw a opportunity and said on coms, “O god they are gonna regret this”

This was actually from the third, but I apparently forgot to post it in here. Apologies for the delay.
---
I'm 99% certain you can't do any industry in a titan.
---
yes, always bring your own booze
---
Double click to win, and yes always manual pilot your ship to anchor the fleet, fleet follows my path if I dont get hit by lance if they are anchored correctly nor will they.
---
I yell every now and then :thonk:
---
Lets see what OPs claims are:
---
* He claims we are salty that we are getting "owned".
---
 There is always some truth to that because if you lose your structure which you worked and paid for then I can understand that people get salty/angry that we werent able to defend them. (Many structures were paid/placed by individuals so that they can use them to rig them a certain way.)
---
* "Hogs Collective is a group of highsec folk that like to think that they can "control" a section of highsec". 
---
 
---
 This, I'd say, is true. When we move to a different system we remove structures from other entities which might be increasing the industry index of the system so that our members can get the most benefit out of being in Hogs. We usually offer other entities to either join hogs, sell their structures to us or to be removed by force. We also gank Retrivers or other badly tanked Barges which show up in Ice belts in which our members are mining. This is to minimize the chance of CODE or whoever else is ganking miners to see the system as a honeypot. If we remove worthwhile targets from the system then CODE wont even bother visiting the system. Bring a well-tanked Skiff or similar -&gt; You are most likely not getting ganked by us.
---
I'm currently not very active so I cant say if his claims are true that we tried to expand to Teonusude but it very well might be.

normally no, but in case some special snowflakes ... it is like people give you not only post to read and laugh, but also offer free popcorn on top.

&gt; A Domi that cannot launch heavy drones is not a proper taste of EVE
---
Do you really need to go all the way up to battleships to be able to tell whether or not Eve is the right game for you?
---
&gt;and also disproportionately slants experience on racial preference. 
---
Well, there is a difference between the races in how easily their gameplay is replicated by bots. The difference between a human ratting in a VNI and a bot ratting in a VNI is at times hard to tell. If there is more active gameplay involved, that is more data for CCP to detect patterns in that distinguish humans from bots.
---
Make drones no longer capable of auto-aggroing.
---
VNI bot problem fixed.

I've dealt with these guys before when they tried a buddy's pocos in a few systems. They talk a big game to try to scare smaller groups and new players. They're quick to fold though when up against a legitimate threat.

Can't blame them though if you could save yourself a week of grinding structures just by talking big game, I would too

I don't know what indies got to do with the ability to resupply yourself, if necessary. You just sound like a lazy ass, who just expects others to stock the market for you.

And yes, if you don't have access to a JF, no matter if by your alliance or by using a neutral JF alt, you're doing it wrong.

EVE ISNT ALREADY DEAD?????

The current wave of chinese botters aren't even trying to make their bot subtle. We had a FW deplex bot do the pod shuffle (undock, coast through invuln, redock, repeat) in Rens because we ran them dry of fitted ventures.
---

looool
---
I worded it poorly, I dont think a domi specifically is a necessary eve experience, however
---
Yes, I believe that having *the ability* to fly a heavy drone domi is a vital part of exploring the concept of eve. Eve is at heart a sandbox, that lets you do all kinds of things and play all kinds of roles. One of those roles happens to be getting cyno'd upon by carriers in your fresh battleship.
---
Perhaps a better statement: the ability to fly a retarded heavy drone tristan fit/myfirstlowsecdomi.jpg/literally anything and die in a fire, without any restriction or forced handholding, is a key experience of eve. In fact becoming dunked upon is a cherished tradition which I practice regularly.
---
There is nothing inherently wrong with alphas or new players in general flying heavy drones in a manner that omegas are innocent of. There *is* something inherently wrong with bot proliferation, both omega (i.e. carriers) and alpha, so we should address that directly. It's just like how the answer to the Corax being slow as shit is not to make every gun and missile system track worse.
---

---
Lines are drawn around the Alpha experience.  Those lines are not arbitrary, and they circumscribe a set of play styles that fall well short of the full EVE experience.  His suggestion is just the movement of a single line.  Alpha newbros will be fine.
---
&gt;either no F2P (too late …)
---
I don't know if you've heard of the F2P game Town Of Salem. They also had a long and protracted battle against bots. They implemented captchas, but bots got around that. They have a player-driven reporting and tribunal system, so that players can ban the bots themselves, but even that got overwhelmed. Everything they tried, the bots adapted. So eventually they said "well, no more F2P then. But everyone who already has a F2P account can keep playing for free, you just can't make new F2P accounts anymore, you have to pay". And that actually worked.
---
If CCP really can't solve the bot problem, they can do the same: every account that already exists - alpha or omega - can keep playing. But if you make a new account, that is restricted to either a X-day trial or a tier below alpha (say, epsilon) that is even more restricted than alpha currently is. And perhaps spending any amount of real money on the game upgrades epsilon to alpha too.
---
That won't fix a thing. Bots will just add an extra command to make them lock targets and hit F - unlike afk ratters, bots are actually 'at the keyboard', so that's no particular problem for them.
---
Interesting. Coincidentally I just quit a corp because I feel burned out and nearly quit the game. Then I figured I try WH before anything and I send an application to a WH corp. They approved me but I'm still waiting for the exit - currently I'm trying to scan my way to their home atm. In less than 24 hours I've scanned dozens of holes (and learn using Pathfinder), avoided lots of hostile camped holes but still no luck finding them.
---
You do the meta gaming shit. I'm on neither side. But PL posting against botting is beyond hypocritical anyways.
---
Remind me why it is CCP's responsibility to stop people from spending money on their game?
---
This is an incredibly huge move for what will probably be zero result. Heavy drone access has far greater benefit than this will yield. Do you have any idea how many ships Alphas have access to with more than 50mbit? And how trivially easy it is to switch to one of many already existing Gila bot scripts?
---
So basically your saying if I'm too poor to own a jump freighter then I should rely on my alliance or I'm doing it wrong? Do you see what you said there? I'm just saying why is it easier for reds to get what they need for a better price but I can't get basic things off the market. You also have three different markets in 2 systems. Most people might put everything in one market to make it easier on the 500 people accessing the market to resupply. You guys are to blind to see the problems right in front of you.
---
never stop making videos please

Oh shit
---
Here I am brother. Wait you told me you were from Salt Lake City and a missionary in Central Russia. I have just been trying to go to lunch with you!!!
---
Scanning in is not a thing, that's why people always have some scanners logged off in the home hole. There are way too many wormhole systems to try to randomly find a particular one.
---
You are going to have to just wait till they can get you a way in.
---
Hey how are you doing in did you know that I don't drink blood according to /u/cactusjack48
---
But I am happy to tell you that I do drink blood. Do you want to get a sandwich.
---
Good on you! Wormhole space is a lot of work but it is awesome.
---
Also, wormhole space is very profitable if done correctly.
---
Will you vote to disband?
---
Hey DO YOU NANO BRO? Sounds like you NANO?
---
Problems with that is you need all other non response fleet stuff. Like dread bomb ganks.
---
You basically are now forced into ever  fast roaming fleets, or covert Ops.
---
Hello hey if you're not posing to be something weird do you want to go get a bite like a sandwich.
---
This is what happens when pigs try to rule... they just get turned into bacon and devoured
---
You are so smart. Do you want a sandwich?

Use a target painter.
---
^this. as you can see OP, be prepared to read a lot. there is so much information about eve and all the things ingame that it can be really overwhelming. so feel free to ask any questions here or in the ingame rookie channel you should have open by default after you start. the eve community is actually super friendly to new players and will help you out for sure. if you have a friend that already plays the game, ask them for a referral link before making an account so both of you get some goodies. other than that, no, just go with the free2play version and see if you like the game first.
---
Kind of a bad sign if they can't find an entrance in 24 hours though.
---
Is there a 'ship tree' of sorts that lets me see the optimal types and examples of ships I'll be using if I decided to do each type of content?
---
For example, when you're doing relic/data sites, I kinda know that you're going to want a T1 exploration frigate, then move on to an Astero or something else once you can afford it. Then maybe a Stratios.
---
What sort of sad cunt is bashing on people who create content. Prolly some dirty risk adverse blobber krab...

Evan seems to be having fun and thats all that matters, power to him.

And you krabby cunts need to undock more.

No how about the army of /u/cactusjack48

Haha there you go again calling people names.

Stop calling people names you are so toxic and I'm offended.

dropped more dreads than they did ships on your own structure grid lol

I’ve ratted many, many a time. I’m the target of guys going after ratters.

Sometimes they get me, sometimes I get away.

Why so much hate towards Test. Be nice.
---
Yeah, understandable that dome frown upon ganking others.
---
But if one or two Catalysts is enough to take down a Skiff, Mackinaw or Retriever then they were just asking for that to happen.
---
And instead of waiting for CODE to visit our systems we simply remove people like that by ourselfes. Content for a couple of people who enjoy ganking ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

To give some more context around the Isanamo fight/Fort loss - because it was great!
---
Being only 2 jumps from Jita - it fell into the great Jita Market Removal project to support the Horde Market in Perimeter and was contracted out to the HiSec merc alliances to remove.
---
VMG (moving into PIRAT for the day to keep potential losses off their killboard ;) ), PIRAT, Public Enemy - all deciding that the HiSec 'veld brains' (I think OP called us) were still too much, so they also drafted in MC from nullsec and a bodge load of neutral Logi to come for the fort.
---
We rallied, brought friends (as they did), used hisec corp shenanigans (as they did, VMG-&gt;PIRAT and neutral Logi)  and killed over 23billion worth of their ships with over 300 pilots on field (at approx 10bill lost ships on our side - excluding the fortizar of course!) - all in Hisec in a glorious battle lasting several hours with no TiDi.  Having so much neutral logi on their end slowed us down and in the end we ran out of time saving the fort rather than ships.
---

---
Best fun I've had in Hisec or null tbh, because it was our group and our friends fighting for our stuff - as EVE should be.  Laughable that EM would try to use that as something to beat us up with, I wear that loss with pride and our group remember it fondly!
---
Undock, fight, have fun, do it again! (Especially in HiSec!).
---
Sounds like he is your level of liar haha!!!
---
I don’t know that it’d have to be boring.
---
I wouldn’t mind shooting a botter at all. The point that they all flee as soon as you enter the system, that alone would be satisfying. Cheap, easy, and annoying :-)
---
Top kek. This was gold!
---
You dont need heavy drones or another expensive stuff (for skill points) to farm your first plex at all. You can go for tier 1 frigate abyssal sites using kestrel and easly farm like 100 mils per hour. Or you can use navy slicer and go for t3 abyssals.
---
Also you can go for exploration or incursions and etc. There is no problem to farm isks as alpha.
---
As a off and on HS dirtbag, im seeing a lot of new char swarms since the PICB migration announcement.
---
Last night i caught one from Mango Army on dscan while passing through caldari space.  Every char was using the Aldent surname from the char creators name generator with a few extra random letters at the end.
---
Im sure he wasnt botting or anything.  After all, lots of eve players sit in belts on week old characters mining in 11 ventures.
---
And after all PBIC, told us in that lovely press release from a couple of weeks ago that they werent going to bot *this* time. :wink:
---
&gt; Is Jeen now multiple people?
---
Depends what time of day it is.
---
Good call, I was thinking Corp standing when I wrote faction.

This was indeed one of the greatest fights highsec had seen for years.

I'm glad I was able to be part of that battle.

There are 2600 wh systems. Its effectively impossible to scan your way in.
---
Inb4 you find "it" out...
---
You had me at the word spreadsheet.  Then you said Indy? Commenting to bookmark the post for when am at a computer.
---
Yes, that is true, but I'm not saying that alphas should or should not farm isk. Heavy drone access is a good experience that hurts no one except when bots use it, you would agree? And it's pretty obvious that removing heavy drones does very little to the actual problem--even the person proposing it admits it is just changing one flavor of bot for another. We can also do a whole lot more to combat bots, still many low hanging fruit to grab.
---
So I think it is definitely the wrong move at this time and very off-target, it doesn't make any sense to implement.
---
Finally, we are one step closer to eliminating VNI botters once and for all
---
Not exactly, no.  However, you can poke around the EVE Uni's [Exploration](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Exploration) write-up for some good information on the topic.  You can actually get pretty deep into exploration without the need to transition to more expensive ships.
---
You and this attitude are part of the problem.
---
&gt;even more so with 150+ in fleet.
---
oh boy

Thanks to all the lovely mission-runners we're farming.

Your Assets window in-game will show you all of the physical assets you have scattered throughout the universe.  You can also use a third-party tool such as jEVEAssets to aggregate that information and make it easily searchable.
---
Why doesn't CCP retune the sites to be more difficult to the point that cruiser class ships cannot speed tank the sites. Tune them for battleship class or higher. Sure it wouldn't curb botting all the way, but it would make it more skill intensive and easier to catch.
---
Mainly Caldari and Gallente space.  They are very inactive in minny space.  I dont often venture into amarr space, so i cant say.
---
Well,  I got Capitals already and I’ve been doing the C5 Naglfar farm.  Fucking with the Chinese might be cool. I wonder if there are any C2’s w/C5/LS statics.

I don't know what that rev is (anteater?) but I love it.

Remove all damage caps, increase structure who by 200%. Thanks.

All structures.

Yes your entire argument was opportunity cost whether you said it or not.

I'm not the person you were arguing with I could give two shits about botting.

&gt; K162 wormholes and signatures are spawned in an invisible state when someone initiated warp to the other side of the connection.
---
Before they're spawned in this invisible state, they do not exist, and therefore cannot be considered by the drifter for a warp-to point (such as planets or other wormholes). 
---
i.e. this combat-probing drifter technique to locate un-spawned K162s is not possible until a warp has been initiated on the spawning side
---
I understand how to search for items, my question was how to search for the valuable items in that pile of information.
---
Well yeh we are talking about a specific hole. 
---
Finding any hole is easy, but if you want the right hole you have to put some effort in.
---
Back in the old days, PLEX were items like any other. It went in your hold. If your ship went up, the plex dropped and whoever got the wreck got the PLEX. Which was why you never redeemed PLEX outside the station you wanted it in (which basically meant "if you're going to sell, redeem it in Jita"). 
---
The only theoretical thing you could do was stick it in a blockade runner because their hold can't be scanned. So blockade runners became "blow it up on the offchance" ships.
---
Flew with HC for a while. Glad I got out and just moved to wormhole space :)

Drone assist/guard are actually very complex and full of bugs and pecularities. They work differently depending on system security and your pvp aggro timer (casually speaking, it carries some of extra data and you might get different behavior depending on if you had PvP aggro or not). In AT11 we recognized early importance of drones and their autoaggro mechanics in damp-rich meta and did series of tests, which were documented in this post:
---
[https://funkyimg.com/i/2THDt.png](https://funkyimg.com/i/2THDt.png)

We used this knowledge (namely, guard order, persistent good target acquiring) a few times to win some unfavorable matchups.

If that's the case, then I circle back to my second point.  jEVEAssets does a lot of the aggregation and valuation of your accounts' assets all in one place, so it's pretty easy to pick through it (at least, once you've gotten a feel for the tool).

Watch the vid posted elsewhere in the sub.  A subcap fleet did bridge in, but was deleted in a beautiful bomb run.

I hope you didn’t get advice from a C4 corp. Cause Wormholes are stupidly profitable :) . Like I’ve got a few BIL in my cloaky hauler logged off next to my farming dread in an undisclosed C5. Ive never been richer than when I went into wormhole space. 
---
If you can fly capitals. I strongly suggest C5’s. Hell if you can field two leshaks I strongly suggest you doing C5 sites W/O the escalations. So maybe a C2 w/C5 static. Butttt rolling in a capital pass is sooo nice.
---
If you’re tryna make isk. Make sure to look for your holes PI. MANY wormholes have perfect or near perfect PI. Before C5’s ruined making isk any other way. I used to make 2BIL a month from Running PI on 3 chars on 1 account. 4 day cycles restarted every 2 days (incase you miss a day due to life). Right? So like. This will give you a nice base of isk to launch PVP and Pve fleets.

From here do C3 sites in T3’s. Can make 0.5-1Bil in a good farm sesh. Or C13’s in confessors.

From there, I’ve seen 3 different paths people take.

- a fortizar and three dreads. About 2-5Bil max recurring a week due to anom respawning, if you let the grass grow it can be higher for a little. I know a few people are stacking their regions to get this going, but thats long game.
---
- Triple boxing dread With a scanner and your main swapping from pvp, salvaging and whatever. Hauling. Here you literally destroy every anom, then roll for the next target. ( The skys the limit here) these folks have wallets that are only comparable in size to their balls.
---
- Loussy Lou flycatcher style 2 dreads. One fax, one armor web vindi. Same isk as before. You trade a little more isk/hr for the ability to fuck up most people who roll into you. Can fuck shit up, make isk, and never need to dock if you do it right.

Don't be so quick to judge. An *addiction* has severe negative RL consequences. Evan's got no starving kids and he pays his rent on time, so a better word would be *hobby*. Nothing unusual about a young dude pissing away his money on a hobby. Probably earns some revenue from the stream too.

Yes there was some controversy about that in 2012. Turns out that if you're bumping just for the fun of it, it could be considered harassment. But if you have a business selling mining permits then you're covered.

Yes that's exactly right because most people advocate what is good for them not what is good for the game. These jammers have been great for tge alliance I am in FRT but terrible in current form for the game.

The weird thing is that some of the best third party sites and programs that EVE had, have already died.

Dotlan SSO is pretty useful for that

So this IS the hill you want to die on, crazy.  Here's the thing, somebody running an anomaly is not like sex.

It's more like cutting the grass. It's also super obvious when it's being done illegally. If you ride by your neighbor doing something blatantly illegal, youd call the cops.  This is no different than that, no matter how much you protest otherwise, saying "it's not my job to catch cheaters" just makes you sound like a dumb cunt.
---
Thank you, I'm always nervous about third-party apps which is why I jumped that point at first.   
---
I dabbled in markets during my last run with eve, and now my character window shows an insane amount more than I would have said the char was "worth" but without knowing what special item was insanely inflated or what ship value exploded, I don't know *why* my net worth is so much higher unless I research tons of it. Add in that I have assets spread all over high/low/and null sec and I wonder if some items are reflecting a higher value because of the markets they are trapped in.
---
Yeahhhhhh. If I were OP I would setup in a hole with static set to  🎯 your home hole , an orca/Capital suitcase and a rolling ship. And then pin that on the corps tripwire incase people roll into OP’s chain.
---

sure but running an anomaly isn't blatant botting.

This is your traditional reminder that multiboxing does not necessarily imply botting.

I admit I'm not sure why one would plex 11 characters rather than plexing 5 and buying skill injectors to do something better than venture mining, but people have done crazy things before.
---
feel free to post your fleets :)
---
It could get more interesting if CCP invested into adaptive AI. Throw out some small tests, if the bot reacts or behaves faster than a human can physically achieve then either suspend and flag them for moderation observation and review or start throwing curve balls at the bot to drive the developer of it insane.
---
Best bet is probably waiting for a HS/LS/NPC NS hole to open up.

Then there’s “cruiser-down” and similar size/speed restrictions.
---
lol, but how would i afk 4 VNIs without near2?
---
Here's a dumb idea I should be ridiculed for - we already have "super rats" that would mess up any subcap ratter. Why not have these guys show up to "protect" their brethren in the anoms? You can adjust their reaction time so that anyone paying even a reasonable amount of attention can get out and it uses assets already in the game. Having never written a bot, I have no idea how easily (maybe even trivially) this would be defeated by the botters. Maybe those "diamonds" next to the bot names make it too easy, idk.

I'm only talking about the real cost of hiring devs to fight the bots. and this has nothing to do with opportunity cost at all.
---
By building jobs, do you mean it can start the jobs from there or do you still have to log in each character individually to start the jobs?
---
Industry 4.0 here we come!
---
I'd delete this so the creators don't know the problem sooner
---
I think that is interesting, but let's guard ourselves from generalizing. Something that worked in a context may not work in another, and though I wished CCP had not added alpha (or limit it to non-isk generating actions) it *may* actually be bad to remove it (note the modal form, as I actually don't have any futuresight power).
---
But yeah the issue is that whatever energy you place in the bot fight, bots devs will anyhow have more to place against you so it's a long-lost battle.
---
You still have to start the jobs in game. This is more just planning what you are going to build and show if you are missing Mats (Without having to login).
---
Will the combat become more interesting over time? Because it's really dry starting out

It's no less relevant than nullsec nonsense.
---
because it works outside of it
---
Normally you should only see wormholes on overview if you're on grid with them.
---
and instead of doing all that effort, get 3 vni alts and half afk rat on them 3-6 hours a day (~6 clicks per site, ~36 cph for 3) for 150m an hour easy 99% afk
---
&gt;pretends that EVE never has any problems ever under windows
---
yep, sounds like a pointless edgelord with nothing useful to say
---
There are rare occasions where speed and ships on grid are more important than what people are flying. "Rage kitchen sink pings" where people will just get somewhere in what ever is on hand, even Procurers and Ventures will rock up to do something or take some damage and be meat shields.

More than half this video was you burning gates. Literally all you gotta show us is the site itself. Nice idea but we didn't need to see you burn through empty facwar systems for 15 minutes
---
omgf i'm super omega cringing at this post...
---
Ok
---
Please make more, this is what eve needs.
---
One other option I *think* you could try is opening the asset window, expanding ALL of the sections/stations in the list, and then Ctrl+A/Ctrl+V'ing that list into Evepraisal.  You may have to break the list up into chunks to get it to work though.
---
Disclaimer: I haven't tried this.
---
Lutris.
---
Because voting for labels instead of specific issues is a good idea?
---
&gt;Do you have any idea how many ships Alphas have access to with more than 50mbit?
---
And?  Alphas can never fit a ship as well as an Omega.  That’s just part of the circumscribed play.
---
&gt;And how trivially easy it is to switch to one of many already existing Gila bot scripts?
---
Scripts aren’t the issue, economics is.  Gilas change the risk/reward equilibrium of botting; potentially making botting an inferior isk faucet for most.
---
PvP can be very interesting if you are doing more then just pressing F1. If you are referring to PvE though, then probably not. Abyssal PvE is not terrible, but even that gets old after a while. The same could be said about incursions, but those are more ridged and get old even quicker.
---
Running c5 or c6 sites with dreads is definitely the way forward
---
1. They effect any refining of the ore they refer to.
---
2. They are just achievements currently.
---
Why should Alpha accounts have the same experience as Omegas?  They shouldn't.  That's why they're alpha accounts.
---
To be honest, it would be much better if the MBit was less for Alphas, versus walling off specific types of drones.
---

---
How about proper anti bot work by CCP.
---
The game should be designed to be as enjoyable as possible for human players. Anything bot related has to be fought by banning.
---
As you may have noticed from the comments op, the CSM has some "personal issues" to address. Issues such as credibility, fairness, bias and evidence of productivity seem to plague the CSM to the point that few have faith in it let alone care about it at all. Whether those perceptions are real or not, they are something that the CSM might be interested in addressing since they do affect things like player participation. 
---
Tbh the perception that CSM is a null block function is a big problem. It's a problem created by the CSM itself either through poor communication or its' own actions. This alienates most of the players that are not null sec alliance members and those individuals' alt accounts.
---
These thing have culminated into what is, at best, an apathetic majority punctuated with open hostility towards the CSM. Maybe CSM doesn't actually care about this since they don't need any votes outside the null blocks or maybe it does care. If it doesn't then it can stop pretending to be a player representative and just consider itself meta game play. That's for the CSM to decide.
---
This is actually what an electorate system of voting is designed to prevent. Simple majority voting does a really poor job and ends up only representing some areas at the expense of all else.
---
IIRC I turn it off at one point and then just completely smoothbrain turning it on again for the rest of the fight.
---
It wasn't a hugely impactful thing as we honestly should have kept ABs off for cap given the speed advantage the Munnins vs us, but it would have helped when I tried to slingshot them middway through the 2nd fight.
---
Logi PoV is super important to being able to see what's happening to your fleet! Otherwise it's just counting explosions to see which side is winning.
---
IIRC in Templar One a Minmatar General (or something like that) says the future of his people is outiside K-space (or beyond the New Eden cluster or so, I can't recall). 
---
I've heard that there are Minmatar titan wrecks in W-Space somewhere, but I never wen't to look for them...
---
I was hoping they'd continue with that storyline... maybe this is part of it, it would fit nicely.

---
Hey, it's like real life.
---
How is this a good thing? Doing nothing is never better then doing something. Atleast when titans and supers are out you could maybe do something against them. When everyone is docked up because of stupid mechanics nothing will happen.

I hope they make us run them in 1000 t1 frigates like last time
---
Then, you are speaking to the quality of the Alpha experience, in which case I would say, fine, but don't do a half-assed thing with mbits. Just wall off a class of ships entirely and be clear and even about it. Personally, I never thought it made any sense for Alphas to have pirate ship access, like pirate battleships, or stuff like the Orthrus. PLEX was definitely cheaper before, but I thought that a properly fitted pirate BS isn't that far off a 1.5b isk plex so they might as well just be expected to pony up the isk for Omega if they really wanted pirate ships.
---
But your point serves to show exactly, that there is definitely value right now for alphas to have this max drone capability. This is something they will lose in a very strange, poorly considered, and bandaid way with the proposed change, which was my point against it.
---
So like, I agree with you, that somewhat makes sense, whereas just a heavy drone cut because bots use heavy drones makes very little. I honestly don't know how that sparked so much controversy.

&gt;Edit: also you and I know that running VNIs is 80% AFK at best. Stop lying to yourself.
---
if you do it wrong, I just touch them every 30 minutes and ignore the 5 minute variation in site times.
---
i run 20 and it takes me like 3-4 minutes to pull all drones, warp to new site and have them all farming again every 30 minutes. 3 accounts is far less touching.
---
near2 makes it so easy
---
Oh
---
Haha they have Call to Mine? CTM? Haha. Also, that extreme carebear saying they don't have the isk to fight a war is the number one problem. That type will always make an excuse to not be of use.
---
Wormholes are spooky - nobody knows
---
Shädman doing an Aura cartoon? xD
---
Yes, alphas do not have the full capability of Omegas and I'm perfectly aware of that. However, my argument is that cutting heavy drones to hurt bots also has incredibly far-reaching blanket effects on a lot of ships that completely isn't called for or considered.
---
Gilas actually do not change the risk/reward significantly. You do not need to Omega for a Gila, and they earn more if you use the missiles than a VNI by virtue of higher drone speed, dps, and better application. If anything Gilas are better for bots because they're able to use the missiles constantly. The only reason VNIs are used is because they are just the very bottom of the barrel of investment, and that's exactly what is needed when risking bans--but if Gilas are required, I don't think any botter will blink at the extra 150m or so of cost when a single ship can easily pull in several billion a month. Like, this is seriously an insignificant change, 99% of botters will still be there in different ships after a week or two of adjustment.
---
It does make for shinier killmails and I do think that's nice, but fundamentally it fails to address botting in any meaningfully targeted way, compared to its side effects. That's all I'm trying to say.
---
i thought it was an orthrus
---
&gt; to figure out if an account is botting you have to go out of your way to do it 
---
No you don't, casual observation is more than enough, its not going out of your way unless you're the type of shit human being who doesn't pick up liter because "it'd be going out of your way and they pay people to do that".
---
You *are* that type of clown aren't you.
---
The point of the analogies is to demonstrate what kind of shit person you are, if you'd be willing to ignore those other things because 'its not your job', you are literally a trash human being.
---
Plenty of neutral freight companies will move the stuff for you for a very minimal cost.  Buying from Jita and shipping 2 jumps out of Provi would be less than the cost of most things on the provi market.
---
If you have a problem with the market, there are plenty of ways to change it.  Complaining about it won't do anything.  And remember: it's your allies who are ripping you off.
---
does this one use linear programming?
---
You're missing the point, it's not about drone domis.
---
It's that firstly, that kind of proposal does pretty much nothing to botting, and we have better ideas on the table.
---
However, it also has a huge impact on playstyle options for a number of players that is just completely brushed under the rug.
---
It's like, oh, I dunno, fixing lurch hictors without considering how it impacts wormholes. It's just completely sloppy and personally I believe that's way too sloppy for it to be an actual thing suitonia pushes.
---
Casual observation I going out of your way.

Do you really think you're fooling anyone?
---
Alpha accounts are not meant to be a staple population of the game.
---
No one should be OK with anyone thinking that they are.
---
If Alpha accounts are part of the reason something is broken in the game (Alpha VNIs is what we're talking about here), then take away whatever the hell it takes to fix the problem.
---
You sound like you're trying to protect the status quo for accounts that have no bearing on whether or not Omegas get to continue to play the game.
---
And no, we're not talking about casuals, we're not talking about people who have Alpha'd their accounts on a break.
---
We're talking about people who will be forever-Alphas, or have a ridiculous amount of Alpha accounts to pay for their ridiculous amount of Omega accounts.
---
Break their game.  It matters not to the game.
---
What's funny is they twisted your words far less than you twisted theirs. But that's just typical edgelord behavior
---
Ah right, cheers.
---
Honestly, they're just sort of dicks to anyone that isn't them. The above are just shallow justifications for the usual HS BS. What's amusing is that they pride themselves in doing all of it.
---
No, we've encountered a new species... the HAW HAW dread.
---
I'll have to disagree with you. Especially at current plex prices, there are a lot of casual players who don't feel motivated to buy plex with isk or swipe the card and prefer to stay alpha and play that way. I can name about a half dozen that I know about.
---
I'm sure if you ask around in any decently sized group you'll find a handful. Right now the economy's just super high on PLEX and that's how things are. If you can't swipe and you can't disappear 2.5b on plex a month for your playstyle, you almost certainly aren't getting any Omega.

---
That looks really good! It's a really pretty work of art, even looks finished to me
---
Yo CCP, let me get a Plex sale.
---
Look, CCP set them up this way, and that was their express intention--to provide a permanent trial, and increase player retention. I agree that it is a flawed system, especially with alpha abuse that is hard to limit, but that doesn't mean you can just hamfist side effects from other changes and pretend you're not doing it.
---
I'm not trying to argue or disagree with you on alpha clones, man. Having a million alpha VNIs that you run virtualboxes to fund your omega is pretty shitty and also can be pretty damn unfair at the extreme end, and that for sure should change. Personally I think that letting alpha clones at pirate BSes for example was a mistake and there's no two ways about it.
---
However, there are actual newbies in he alpha class, and I don't think it's necessarily harming anyone for them to do things. "My first battleship" moments are definitely cool for them until the cyno gets lit. Liking drones is perfectly acceptable, and so is being Gallente despite what Calmil says. :P And there are for sure casual players who do have a hard time putting out sub money--especially iskwise. Looking at PLEX prices I can sympathize with them and am glad there's a fallback option so we can still fly with some cool dudes who can kick ass even in T1.
---
So like, you can't just say fuck it all, we don't care because bots are bad, especially when your change doesn't actually affect bots that much. The \*only\* point I was trying to make was that, this does have a huge effect on the Alpha playstyle that can't be swept under the rug. I have more faith in suitonia than that. If he said heavy drones should be taken away from alphas, I'm confident that he'd have put a ton of thought into talking about how it affects alphas, how it affects bots, and why it's worth it as a trade. However, this literally doesn't do jack shit to bots besides change the meta flavor so I have a hard time accepting that it was really something he proposed seriously. That's all.
---
If you feel like alphas should be changed, that's great. Go propose changes on alphas and get in on that conversations. However, when you do, actually \*target\* the problem and think things through. Maybe you think that Alphas should have stricter controls--propose those changes exactly. If you feel like heavy drones should be taken away, walk through that proposal--what are we losing, what are we gaining? Should we consider removing other large weapons or hulls with it? And talk about it beyond the tight scope of what's the "best" in the meta right now.
---
That's the proper way to talk about changes in this game I think. Carefully, completely, and passionately. You seem like you care a lot about this, and I have faith in you too.
---
&gt;its in your best interest to keep your community clean.
---
If it doesn't come at an extra cost to me, sure. Shame that isn't the case though.
---
i honestly couldn't give a fuck if ccp address the botting problem or not - if they don't i'll just stop giving them money rather than start giving them unpaid labour on top of my money.
---
&gt;like 'just being a normal decent human being'.

apparently you can't be a normal decent human being if you want to spend your recreational time enjoying yourself rather than having a second unpaid job that you pay to do. TIL.

---
Real cost js directly related to opportunity cost. If you can afford 10 developers but determine you to allocate 9 of them to new content and 1 to botting it can be weighed against the opportunity cost of devoting 10 to botting and 0 to content... or 5 to each... etc.
---
You are absolutely describing opportunity cost
---
I'd critique your change and say that, if you're going to do that, it doesn't make sense to have a special VNI exception. If it happens, it would make sense for it to be a class ban:

* Empire Faction Cruisers and Battleships

* Pirate Cruisers and Battleships

Why don't you fit a cloak? Is it fitting concerns? Bombers have the slots for torps, a launcher and a cloak.
---
Ah yeah I used mine for C3 sites and didn't really need the prop.  In abyssal you'd actually want it.
---
So.. uh.. I just gotta ask. Why the power diagnostic? Fitting only two capital modules couldn't have drained his PG that bad...
---
easily, most of the big alliances will fit you (maybe avoid pandemic horde, they're a bit more pvp-focused in a sense)
---
casually doing things with a big alliance is pretty simple and doesn't mean you have to commit very much time, give it a go. maybe join something like brave
---
INB4 crab hands skin!!!
---
&gt;However, my argument is that cutting heavy drones to hurt bots also has incredibly far-reaching blanket effects on a lot of ships that completely isn't called for or considered.
---
Outside of VNI ratting, what sort of negative “incredibly far-reaching effects” are Alphas likely to endure?  And how would you quantify “incredibly far reaching effects?”  Like, instead of accessing 16.67% of the game, they’ll only be able to experience 15.94%?  I’m just not seeing how the overall negative effect in legitimate play is more than a tempest in a teapot.
---
&gt;Gilas actually do not change the risk/reward significantly.
---
You’re getting ~10% more maximum dps—tops—with worse application in a hull that costs 2.5 times more.  Your assessment is incorrect.
---
Please yes
---
If you are so interested in killing bots, why not kill the ones in Fraternity you are aligned with?

Cerb for exotics, vaga for electricals or gammas, dual web onyx for darks.
---
I love my t4/5 vaga! With 220s, you mow through just about anything with ease, and 750+ dps is fantastic. Tracking score can be upwards of 75, so misses are rare. 
---
The large cap battery in an electrical means neuts are basically irrelevant.
---
All this would do is give a dozen people who are (admittedly) good players a reason to be even more full of themselves than they already are.
---
Gallente Faction Warfare thanks you
---
I'm not sure why so many people think there needs to be one simple fix-all change made.
---
There are a multitude of changes that can be made to combat the current botting schema.
---
First, you have to realize that the majority of ratting botting madness revolves around Alpha accounts and injectors.  Those two systems are contributing more to botting than anything.  We know this.  Step one is admitting it.
---
There doesn't have to be a catch-all change, implemented once, that fixes everything.  There never will be.  So, you remove the systems that are being exploited piece by piece until you get the desired outcome.
---
If forcing botters to change their meta is step one, and the only drawback is less career Alphas due to not being able to field a battleship or two, why would anyone who wants to continue playing this game ever think that's a bad idea?
---
Your argument is that a fire started inside your home, and you shouldn't try to put the fire out because it's keeping the freeloaders warm.
---
Wtf is this from?
---
Region block China, if. You don’t cure the cancer, the cancer will cure you
---
You really shouldn't need carrier backup to kill a pair of t1 cruisers and a frig when you have 5 AFs and a HAC, just sayin. It was mostly a problem at small scale, nobody blames anyone for running from a blob fight.
---
Lots of HS wardeccer shit talk with no results is the problem too. Also fudgery with NIPs. I've seen the mutual diplo channel so I do know that they do actually lie to line members about what NIPs are active when, and there was more than one occasion when they were begging for them when nearing hull timers. Unfortunately mostly afk alliance head didn't understand how slanted the deals were and kept making executive decisions to take them--he and Darius are friends or something.
---
Yeah we call that zkill.
---
CCP would probably fuck up and only count kills if you got the final blow, encouraging shit like smartbombing BSs and instalocking.  These things are okay in small numbers, but if you're gonna put rewards on numbers of kills, errybody gonna get to whoring, and their autism will invade every aspect of eve.  
---
Instead of having 3-5 systems in lowsec with really active smartbombing campers, imagine them being in just about every lowsec pocket and pipe.  Then imagine the idiots in fleets who will ditch tank mods so they can fit sebos and sigamps so they can whore on all the kills.
---
If CCP could be trusted to do this well and fairly, sure, okay.  But this is CCP we're taking about.
---
Hello.
---
For a brief moment I thought I was on the 2007scape subreddit.
---
If the plan is to lose the ship, then taking care of opsec does not further the plan.
---
Evan has lost a few ships in Provi - at first we thought he was obvious bait, but people eventually realized that losing ships was his thing.  I think he left because we were not being aggressive enough anymore - "oh, it's Evan... eh, I'll come over in 30 minutes if he's still there.  maybe".
---
Shouldve noticed that enemy bifrost a lot earlier :)
---
&gt; A Domi that cannot launch heavy drones is not a proper taste of EVE and also disproportionately slants experience on racial preference.
---
A real new player has to wait, at alpha training speeds, what, six months to have a reasonably well skilled battleship? I really don't think alphas need to be able to fly battleships to get a 'proper taste of Eve' or 'try stuff like nullsec fleet content'. And how many real new players are buying into VNIs or gilas?
---
Sixteen Candles.

I re-watched it while working on the gif and, like most teen comedies of the 80’s, it hasn’t aged well.

$3,000 per year or $250 per month. Honestly when you look at it that way it's not *so bad* and unrealistic. Would I do it? Not a chance. But if the guy has the disposable income and this is what he wants to spend it on, who the hell are we to hate? I have hobbies, like astronomy, that have cost be thousands to get started. Small price to pay to be be happy, feel good, and connect with other people.
---
You’re comparing 20 accounts to 3 though.
---
Thats 10,000Plex a month versus 1500. That’s just as much work IMO.

Lol MCAV finally kicked your stupid ass out??? ))))
---
The drifters primary weapon is it’s 200 GJ/s neut which will break your cap chain IIRC. 
---
If you wanna do the drifter you need 3. Twp Leshak synergies well with an EOS you can do the site easier with the armor links and the bonus on drones wreck the small stuff. The Drifter goes for the thing with tje highest sig radius. The radius of an EOS is 300 &amp; leshak is 370. I know in nestors (sig= 420 lol) if you target paint the eos it’ll be able 420 and get the eos primaried. I haven’t tried it but I would wager If you had a set of target painter drones on your leshaks and hit the eos with 10 you could push it above 370.
---
I think everything about what you just said makes no sense and is not what will happen in any capacity
---
Maybe alphas shouldn't be allowed to use heavy drones.
---
Am on mobile and will see if that works.  No I don’t comment on a lot of things.
---
That's legal in the UK.
---
You should really consider making it only show the signatures within any single constellation if you wanted some constructive feedback.
---
This way people still have to travel to acquire the basic knowledge of what sig is where.
---
But what was written in chinese?
---
Congratulations on the 1100 members. Keep up the recruiting.

Dang, HQG is leaking hard lately.
---
Have a look at my kb. There's one zealot loss somewhere with a decent fit (overpriced but the concept works for t2 mods as well). It was pretty much three heavy pulse lasers. Gist Xlarge shield booster. Amplifier, 2 adaptive invulns, AB, Cap battery and heat sinks. No DC needed. Rigs as you see fit
---
Hype is Req's Most Prized Fursona
---
&gt; I guess you can somewhat sig tank lances?
---
It's why the fleet only allows mwd on the dictors. Between the sig tank, warps and the emergency booshes, if the FC is on point, you can't do anything without subcaps.
---
Someone posted a similar thing a few days ago. Perhaps with the World Ark reaching the next construction stage they're becoming more aggressive in defending it. Perhaps its just a bug. Nobody knows :p
---
CCP can't fix your IQ.
---
Docking Request, Accepted.
---
Skeez on chicks.... looks pretty spelled out there for you. Where is the confusion?
---
Removing heavy drones from alphas is hardly the solution when the problem is the hull.
---
I really don't understand why they went after the drone max velocity bonus in april when the problem is and always has been the tracking speed bonus. 
---
If they made the tracking speed bonus only apply to lights &amp; mediums, it breaks the hull for botters and AFKers because you'd have to swap to lights to take out the frigates in any given wave.   
---
There is also a startling lack of scramming frigates in so many anoms its silly. You want to increase the risk of botting/ratting? put scramming frigs in every single wave of every anom, give them small sig and high speed so people are forced to adapt.
---
Stop alphas from having access to heavy drones. If you want the best drones, you need to be omega.
---
Would harm the botters greatly.

I think it's probably 'beyond New Eden,' and the project in question is something like... Skymother? Basically a Minmatar mothership to flee the evils of New Eden.

That said, the Minmatar wrecks in question are the Lakat-Hro, a Thukker supercarrier that was part of a convoy that was lost at the same time as the Seyllin Incident, which is what gave us WH space. Basically, strange things happened, Thukker nomads got dumped into unreachable WH space. :x  [https://evetravel.wordpress.com/2015/05/](https://evetravel.wordpress.com/2015/05/)

having fun in a game has nothing to do with simple civic duties like reporting people for fucking up.  They are not somehow mutually exclusive in that you can't do both, you just have a brain pan the size of a ferrets so its a struggle for you.  The rest of them might forgive you for it but I'll still call you a turd.  Turd.

Yeah - My audio wasn't good enough so I ripped the audio from a third person's recording. I'm hoping to get better at syncing and to do this more in the future with my fights!

Apparently I got in late then. Currently 14 days left, claimed 2 rewards so far.
---
Go to all the Calmil stations, pickup the level 4 missions, optimize the route and then run them. Not too difficult.
---
So, genuine heist or just trolling your alliance mates?
---
I'm quite aware of how stukas function :&gt;
---
It's just that we weren't lanced before. Or not that i personally can recall it.
---
It had 4 leshak with web and like 6 neuting one with a couple of harrowing. Fighting was the only option.

thats the worst pun of all time, take my upvote and buy yourself a cookie
---
“Bring whatever you want” Generally no coordination of logi / ewar etc
---
It’s a collectible item detailing an in game event. Does nothing,  but looks cool.
---
Highsec pvpers are useless.
---
I think you have to think like a FC to get it.
---
First, FCs play Eve as a kind of RTS where the individual fleet elements are controlled by an organic idiosyncratic AI. But it's still basically a bunch of units that you deploy to beat the other guy's bunch of units.
---
Just like in *Starcraft* a FC will plan their fleet with units that work well to a particular gameplan. So for instance you could design a fleet around the Kestrel frigate, which is faster than most things that aren't T1 or T2 frigates and has a very long range for that class of ship when fitted with light missiles.
---
Allowing for fleet members with subpar skills you now have a blob of units that go 2km/s while shooting out to about 50-60km. 
---
Your game plan is to either run from or kite long lazy circles around an enemy you never let within 40km. You will be applying your full firepower and most ships in the game can't catch you, it's pretty advantageous against many other compositions.
---
It only works if everyone can move that fast and shoot that far.
---
If you let Johnny Awesome come in with his 2km range Daredevil or Bumbo Wumbo come in with his afterburner Rifter those guys are just useless. Or worse they'll just feed kills because they can't operate with the pack.
---
So basically kitchen sink means a fleet without a gameplan. It's a fleet that allows anything to join because there's no concept of a ship being unsuitable for the plan because there is no plan.
---
How do you prefer to hunt them? Sneak in the complex they’re in without them noticing, camp beacons they’ve already spawned or just wait in a system and warp to the beacon as soon as they spawn it?
---
exactly. complaining and expecting others to cater for him doesn't change anything. he could
---
\- stock the market by himself
---
\- use hauler services to bring stuff close to the border after buying and contracting stuff with a jita alpha clone
---
\- ask his corp mates whether they can pick up his stuff with the next jf run
---
\- use an own neutral blockade runner toon which he scouts for in a ceptor from lowsec gate to 9uy
---
It's gnarly, it would kill half the ocd population of eve, and would be awkward as hell. Doesn't mean its less of a solution. And yes it makes senses to have a vni exception in the context of either that or banning heavy drones on alphas.

This, active players always came first, controled the space for alliance leadership as **gameplay**

And then the botters settle in

Same thing applies everywhere
---
Only three letters? Try Jit....
---
They also give a small amount of +shield regen/max and +cap regen/max. Still doesn't do much of anything on this fit, but fitting all your lows with power diags makes sense on brick-tanked shield caps.
---
the cloak doesn't fit with the medium shield extender and invuln. Inits stukas keep their cloak but sacrifice DPS and some ehp.
---
It's actually not bad once you get used to it. I would even call it better. But humans just have to moan about every change.
---
Yeah how about we turn one of the few true sandbox games into a moba, that oughta do the trick.

have you tried looking at the map?

Doesn't seem like it has ever been sold on NES

I think it is easier to go from negative to positive than it is for positive to higher levels. So if you run low level missions for them, that is one possible, but probably somewhat slow method. 
---
I would also like to know if there are any tricks to getting out of negative standings with specific factions, I know you can use tags for sec status, but no clue outside of level 1 missions for factions.
---
I mean, I've found a specific hole I was looking for before. It took several days of non stop scanning but it's definitely not impossible. If you're looking for a a specific C4 for example then just follow the C4's and ignore anything going up. I feel like C5 is probably the easiest to find a specific hole from the outside since once you're in a C5 they generally lead to pretty big C5 highways.
---
The new agent finder is just objectively worse, what are you smoking? You can't even see more than like 10 agents at a time.
---
what the pay out on those rats you get.
---
i didnt look that deep into it.... but a superficial research show me all agents available to me in LOW sec systems... wich is kinda Risky...
---
I believe that at -2 and lower you can only run level 1 agents for them, so you could just fit some cheap frigates and run them in lowsec. Worst case you lose a few.
---
Why would you go to Gallente and Minmatar highsec anyways? There is nothing there.
---
haaa intresting... thnx for the Tip
---
Yeah, you would be surprised, a lot of low-sec is pretty low activity if not basically abandoned and running level 1-2 missions is pretty easy in a frigate or destroyer, so getting caught is pretty unlikely if you pay some amount of attention, also you won't lose much from those ships if you fit them cheaply.
---
Spreadsheets are not good at doing things that update live. Synchronization isn't one of their strengths.

Because it's fun shooting them.

You might want to split it up. At least, I find I respond differently to a huge order in front of me, compared to something more run-of-the-mill.

OTOH you could look at the biggest price spike in the last 3 or 6 months, and set the whole stack to sell at that. Depending on how big a hurry you are in to see the ISKs.

---
Make alpha, engage in some PVE to get the logoff timer. Safe up and then alt+f4 out of the game. Log in main whos in the same safe and kill the alpha's ship. Make new alpha rinse repeat for unlimited kills.

---
&gt; Going forward we will be trying to make some isk (I have been told staying profitable in wormhole space is near impossible)  
---
You were told wrong.  Wormholes are a money printing machine!  You have access to the high end ores.  You have access to all the gases needed for T3 production.  The PI is insane (there's a billion a month right there, passive).  You have high end data and relic sites.  Haven't even gotten to the sleeper sites yet.  Grab you a couple rattlesnakes and start running those sweet C5 combat sites and pull down a billion or so a day.  What do you do when the resources all dry up?  Not sites to run?  Wanna PVP? Run a couple meg's through the hole and start over.  Hell, build a Rorqual and deploy a bunch of Spod athanors if that's your thing.        
---
Now if you have a bunch of players sitting in a C3 HS, yeah, you're pretty much screwed.  If you're wormhole doesn't connect to other wormholes then yeah, you're screwed.
---
Just ask Katia Sae...

&gt;because there are lots of empty systems out there for the taking.

huh?  in what respect is it "better"??  you can't filter high/low/null!  you can't see more than about 10 agents!  Can't easily see which ones you can get missions from and which ones not - you have to inspect each one.

I can't think of a way that it's better - unless you really like looking at CCP's map.

Hey, the Democrats are trying it so it must be a good idea.

Are you a sock account for the dev who made it or just stupid?
---
I honestly think that the only way to make a significant difference is to address pve itself. Rework it from the ground up, focused on active instead of inactive gameplay. That would be the 1st step.
---
2nd step would be a rework of the whole bounty system. No more ISK magically appearing in your character's account, focus it on at least partial looting or some sort of interaction when a site is finished. Double this since bounties are paid out by Concord. It makes sense to have to deliver proof of deed from any system in which Concord doesn't have a presence.
---
There will still be bots no matter what, but these would make it cost considerably more effort, investment and bring down it's efficiency by a large chunk.
---

So uhhhh... is there?
---
I dont know anything about wormholes. Anomolies in null suck for isk, but have a low barrier to entry in terms of isk for a ship and skill. Exploration relic and data sites in null have an even lower barrier of entry, and your average isk/hr should greatly eclipse anom ratting in a VNI, but it is rng based. Sometimes you will find a bunch or relics and make 200mil/hr, sometimes you will only find data sites and make practically nothing. Combat sigs are a different beast. Some are literally worthless and can be done in a t1 cruiser but give no rewards until it escalates 4 times and the final level will be impossible for anything other than a carrier or a small fleet of pirate battleships. Others can be done in a single gila and pay out 1 billion+ for 45mins or work. Knowing which one is which will make the difference. Some corps (shoutout to BNI) have resources where casual ratters can sell their escalations from anom ratting to other people who are dedicated DED runners.

I mean you guys are missing the point I didn't leave for one issue. I left because provi is a fucking joke. Theres some good people there but they don't out way the bad. I'm not looking to be catered too, I'm looking people in the alliance to not be greedy pieces of garbage. My corp mates were great it was the rest of the alliance that made me leave. Your Intel channel is a fucking joke your you have only like two good FCS the rest of them are rediculous to the point most of my corp won't fly under them. You people are a special breed because although you can run into these problems elsewhere things can be changed, you fail to recognize the fact most of you are a joke.
---
With GalMil on the ropes this won't be as easy.
---
awesome video, god I kinda miss this game. even though I'd probably be the moron lancing in the complete opposite direction
---
Enter the FC program of your large alliance. If you arent in a large alliance then check out FCibg for Spectre Fleet
---
EVE is generally best when CCP empowers us to fix our own problems rather than fixing them for us.
---
I thought the anniversary was 4th June
---
Great idea!
---
This sounds like a great project for you to do yourself! Code up a webpage, get some prizes in hand, and start up a ladder just the way you want.
---
Then advertise it here in r/Eve, I'm sure it will get a fair review with lots of constructive feedback. You might even become eve-famous like Squizz(Zkill)!
---
Also never had problems with sound...

IKR most of the avocado farmers would never smuggle anything illegal and the ones that would have made previous migratory arrangments to avoid troubles.

EXIT in TIKLE. best AUTZ.

Lol. A plan practically oozing with sucksess\*.
---
\*I did that on purpose for fun.
---
I'm going to try to run for CSM next year I think that was made plenty clear. I'm not using it as propaganda to get votes I'm just trying to share my Eve story and see if people see the appeal of my candidacy.
---
&gt;  simple civic duties
---
fucking rofl.
---
it's a game, my only duty is to enjoy it.
---
Third decade? Somebody mathed wrong.
---
Thats a very compelling story and you sir have a cool job few people have the balls to be the person responsible for fixing shtf scenarios.
---
I'm pretty sure it isn't it's a smart abuse of in game mechanics as far as I know.
---
Well in this case they are related boy/girl.
---
It's a shame that it's quite hard for us players to get involved with the lore (as in it's not really integrated with the game) as it seems so dense, well thought-out and layered.
---
you fight WITH the guys protecting bots. in a war AGAINST bots. so yeah... smoothbrain much eh...
---
Tyool?
---
A lot of JF pilots assume the ship will last at least 12 when calculating revenues. They ussually survive at least 30 but gankers gotta gank so ymmv.
---
Even money says he didn't even know to ask, lol!
---
I have used both yes and alliance services as well.
---
:sob: don't make fun of me
---
I'm not going to mention the Kitten with Mittens because he definetly din't do that.
---
At least 30? What the fuck are those idiots doing to be so incompetent. And who the fuck is making 10b in 12 trips to pay for a new jf.
---
Save up giving people silver isn't as important as your future economic success.
---
My mamma she wasn't 100% correct do.
---
Look that's what I have heard I never actually piloted a JF just spoke to a bunch of them over my years doing this and that's their math probably includes insurance and its to break even.
---
lol, what an attitude. ^^
---
Well they’ve given you some pretty bad info in that regard.
---
to be fair i forgot about abyssal space, probably because it's hardly worth doing (t1s and t2s are botted to hell, driving prices down)
---
but my point still stands, the majority of eve pve updates have been massive failures
---
what are: skill injectors
---
is that you lumpy?
---
CCP finally integrated the chinese into in-game lore
---
one step forward, one step back
---
no it does not. Opportunity cost is when you need to allocate a limited resource.
---
When you PAY for something it's not opportunity cost, even if it's limited : it's cost. opportunity cost refers to something you don't pay, but that you use.
---
So no, opportunity cost has nothing to do with employing people.
---
Stop using fancy words when you don't understand them.
---
casual players don't play to plex.
---
Seriously don't understand why Agency must blink (I wrote 'must' since it isn't possible to disable it).
---
If I'm looking for something to do, THEN I'll open it an look at it.  I don't care -- does anyone? -- to be notified of the latest PVE events.
---
You are retarded. 
---
Change my mind.
---
who cares
---
bots are never going to be stopped as long as local exists
---
It’s a waste of time just buying the monthly PLEX and remembering what accounts need what. I use skill injectors right now.
---
Isnt it PIBC. Pan-intergalatic business conglomerate?
---
?????????????????????
---
what are you talking about
---
&gt; The PI is insane (there's a billion a month right there, passive).
---
Agree.
---
I had two chars extracting to P1, and one doing P2 &amp; P3.  Was using 4-day cycles.
---
One account!
---
CCP help this dude.
---
I actually agree. Tbh i am missing a "light" titan that is designed to hit &amp; run tactics but totally lacks tank (aka &lt;10mil EHP on full tank fit).
---
It's counterproductive to be overly concerned about one particular group when it's a universal problem. You will not change my mind on this point.
---
You should ask nicely with a PM to one of the mods.
---
no it isn't, at all.
---
Don't Feed.
---
Have you been able to prove your claims with hard evidence yet? Goons have gotten caught more than KWG have been. If KWG have so many bots why dont you sit down in Omist and report them all day? It's because there aren't as many as you believe. At least I am not getting all worked up over some disgrace of an idea.
---
Yes a jukebox...totally need this in EVE tbh.
---
* Find a wormhole.   
---
* Deploy station.

---
* Win all of the prizes while murdering someone's killboard.
---
Thank you for the How-to Video.
---
In addition to the other response, the fleet has ships that aren't bombers.  So cloaking the bombers doesn't help much.
---
They're snakes. Sneaky snakes.
---
Ask that dude who wanted to lose his virginity to a hooker-Aura at eve Vegas a few years back. Maybe he videotaped it.
---
No problem mate. It is just a very common grammatical error these days and one that is so easily avoided.
---
The loophole is that harassment is not allowed but extortion is.
---
It was well fitted Phoenix.
---
I never heard about that. Hahaaaa :-)
---
I put together a video series a few years ago that goes over [the basics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAH4DGgl_grA0zsvEk2Tu6garwSbAs49a), but the thing I'd most recommend you do is simply pay attention to what your FC is doing, and volunteering to do things like scout/call targets - Working closely with another FC and seeing what they do so you can pick up on it is easily the best way to learn the craft!
---
I'm sitting next to a huge laser cutter, brb.
---
Does this mean Eve is finally old enough to file for emancipation and leave CCP?
---
no   
---
just no
---
i dont need proove if THEY made a reddit post admitting it. supporting it with numbers of isk/bots involved. remember the 10 or 11 nyxes that were killed once within like one night? all KWG bots...
---
like cmon, you cant be that blind, ignore all that and accuse others of botting while litterally the same thing happens inside YOUR boarders.
---
ive reported literally hundred of bots multiple times... but as you might know, ccp doesnt really care
---
I'd say the game is more polished and accessible to a casual player than ever.  Even just sitting in the NPC corp, there are non-major alliance affiliated player communities for Incursion running, roaming PVP, exploration, doing Abyssal stuff, and more.    
---
You can easily just sign up for public fleets and do these things, which is pretty cool.
---
RIP moondoggie.
---
At least you were one of the male dictions and not one of the niddies!
---
It depends entirely on how you want to FC. There are many, many styles.
---
A top level FC can combat scan, lead the fleet in fleet warps on top of hostiles, anchor the fleet and broadcast all at once. Others delegate roles. Another example of FCing tactics is Spectre Fleet's Big Game Hunters which typically has 4 scouts, the FC systematically checks Dotlan and moves the fleet without posting destos. If the scouts are good (and they are in this case) then we burn to kill whatever is tackled. 
---
Important to note that these 4 scouts and never more than a few jumps of the fleet, in many different directions allowing Spectre Fleet to cover multiple regions in a single fleet and extract relatively unscathed.
---
On the most basic level, you've got ultra simple Green is jump Red is hold. Jump and align. Watch your fleet members speeds, and fleet warp to the next gate. If you find something along the way, you anchor up (and this doesn't have to be you as the anchor) and either choose to engage or flee.
---
In small gang fights you'll find a lot of manual piloting. In this case the FC is basically the same as a line member except for a few key points, such as broadcasting, or calling for a slingshot (nano fleets) - everybody, including the FC, flies their own ship. Fly together, die together.
---
Some tips on voice broadcasting:
---
\- Use the first three letters of a target, or a system name, rather than saying the full thing. "R-E-M is primary" "Align to U-E-F gate"
---
\- Try not to say Jump on comms unless you really mean it. Even the best of us will lemming sometimes.
---
\- If you die as FC and don't have a secondary established, try and get your pod safe and warp back at range. Then keep calling targets. You'll need help from fleet members IE damage reports, if they're tanking etc.
---
Hope this helps.
---

I agree that the PLEX prices are high.
---
just how cap vs sub cap should go. caps have the dps alpha and ehp but them and there damnge is easily out maneuvered
---
I don't have any confidence in csm it's only gonna be People from huge nullsec entities. So why should i Care ?
---
No opportunity cost is what you give up for something else. There is a general assumption CCP has FINITE payroll budgeting.
---
I have 2 timeslots a week of 2 hours each. How much isk can i make in total per week with 3-boxing dreads? Those are 3 accounts in total, or 4?
---
How would this compare to my 6 account 1 bil/hour farm i have? I can do it any time i want, with NO downtime.
---
Cool, you got a mac version?
---
Keep feeding till you don't.
---
You have to be fucking dirt retarded to believe it's players responsibility to deal with cheaters. Fucking retarded
---
SAVE THE CAT!
---
There's some merit to it, depending on availability of Proton (which is basically improved Wine) on your distribution: Steam provides Proton. To bring those improvements to Wine you have to install DXVK (which is needed if you want fast dx11-level of graphics, dx9 works alright w/o that) into wine "drive environment" which also might be pain in the ass, and optionally rebuild Wine from source with set of extra patches.
---
So steam is indeed easier for relatively casual linux user than building proton / installing dxvk into your wine.

Very few FCs would be able to thread lances like that. Init did a great job with the big lazers.

Mango is already filling up with botters.  They are in HS atm, but theyll probably be in Rorqs by the end of next month.

Looks like fun

What are you waiting for?
---
Yeah that's the dude.
---
The use of VNIs is our problem to solve, the use of botters is their problem to solve. They have been nuking bots at a pretty good clip as of late.
---
Yikes.
---
It can be made workable, but calling it "better" is just a flat out lie.  Agency does not have feature parity with the features it replace, and that's not even talking about its horrible performance.
---
it exists. It is called 4 dreads ;)
---
Thanks! Learned some more lore i didnt know yet.
---
I found two ghost sites in one system.  I warped out of the first one not knowing about the detonation.  The second one popped my astero and most of the 45 mil in loot i got from the first site.
---
Made a legion hacker for tanking the ghost data site detonations.  Havent found another one since.
---
Yes but if my contract alt is not at the same station as my hauler then I can’t transfer the goods after i create a new contract for myself

I love this, shows that caps arn't the always the best answer to everything
---
Have seen this mentioned a few times in the subreddit, what is crab?
---
TAPI sided with Goons long before that you walnut.
---
The agency revamp on SISI has actually put the original agent finder into it, it’s absolutely good on there now~
---
Could very well be that the cityship/world ark angle is how CCP's going to give us beachhead/bridgehead FOBs, allowing them to rip out POS code.
---
You missed an opportunity to put Pearl abyss logo on his face

If your in goonswarm FC for welp squad best way to learn and you get your first few welps done and get used to it

Hard to play eve regular style after you’ve played it in hard mode I.e wormholes :)

How about?

FRT happens to be near end of test cap roam, decides to whore on killmails as test is self destructing  
---
Noraus tells chinamen and co not to post stupid stuff on reddit like this post  
---
Legacy spy posts this to make FRT look like idiots and piss Noraus off because they know people will look at killmails and see what happened  
---
It would certainly be the first reddit post that has tipped public commentators to test side instead of them laughing at them in recent weeks.  
---
GGWP
---
You all got played like a violin.
---
Solo pvp hasnt changed much over the years. If youre comfortable fighting against the clock/multiple hostiles then youll be fine. Its still better than being a f1 monkey.
---
So, I just checked the wardecs in-game, and it looks more like you and yours have lost \~17b and killed \~5b...?
---
FW frig pvp is definitely not dead, some timezones are slow tho
---
Like a mama bird pretending to have a broken wing but she doesn't even have a nest.
---
Woah now.. that was uncalled for.. ccp at least used to care.
---
If you want to make money solo in hs I would recommend abyssal sites, but they aren't really something you can afk. Takes about 400mil to get a gila that can run t3 gammas and you can usually make that back in 3 hours or less if your luck is good.
---
Solo cruise pvp is pretty much dead but solo frig stuff still exists just be aware that afs got a big buff.
---
I got 2 out of 5 😎
---
Because if you don't vote, you're only reinforcing the voting strength of the huge nullsec entities.
---
(and it's _possible_ to get elected without them. Not easy, but possible)
---
Sounds like all the botter would have to do is program to warp out once that rat appears.
---
We need a search bar for the search bar.. or, just maybe get it the fuck off of my fucking UI. Fuck you CCP.

I remember seeing this at the movies, damn I feel old.

Bring back the fucking JukeBox. Dickest move ever, pulling that out. The IGB pull was also a dick move.. FuKung.net (basically imgur before imgur) while mining...
---
We've been having these reports (nearly) daily here at WDS.  I'm glad to see you finally put this up for others to experience ;)

You can definitely disable Agency blink, I have...

It's like there is a limit on amount of showed results and therefore when I expand search distance it just removes some. It's so unreliable, you are better off memorizing systems.
---
I see
---
I wouldn't say that it is better functionally. I do love the UI/UX of it but if there was a version of the agency that had the UX of the current agency with the functionality of the old agent finder that would be amazing. Here is to hoping that is the case when they update the agency in the next release.

You can make 30 new bots a day. They haven't dome anything, banning doesn't do anything

I think we've heard this every year....every.single.year.

they forgot to link it.
---
I don't necessarily need to afk, i think i have around 1.5b saved up and my skills are basically perfect for a Gila (gallente drones and Caldari missiles/shields since i was running a dom and a Raven mainly and occasionally a faction mega that i forget the name of)
---
&gt;unless you really like looking at CCP's map.
---
2D Map &gt; 3D Map
---
Esc -&gt; General Settings -&gt; Uncheck "Try the New Map"
---
You'll thank me later.
---
&gt; New Eden continues its **march toward** the third decade
---
It means we aren't there yet, but we are headed there. And year 16 is more than halfway through the second decade.
---
Solo and micro gang very much alive. Gotta find the right area and geoup to fly with.
---
Check us out "xup" allaince/corp. We do public pick up fleets in our timezone with 0 blues for max targets.
---
Looks good, thank you for sharing, I'll play around with it when I get home (-:
---
I enjoy the abyss a lot and would recommend something other than the Gila but the caldari and gallente hacs are pretty trash for it unless you're willing to dump dollar dollar bills to reach parity. The passive buffer Gila still requires some minimal skill to fly for gammas (around 400 mil) but if you want a more fun/diverse experience you can get a 900ish mil Gila that can do firestorm, exotic, gamma, and electric t3 but it's active tanked so there is a greater chance of making a mistake.
---
Right on! Thanks for the correction!
---
Like I said, the BR is not up to date I have not been playing or paying much attention to anything eve after the last date on that one
---
couldn't care less about the politics, just pointing out that expecting a group with like 20 active characters to "have an actual fight at any scale" against slyce/dark/frat is just silly
---
Gila is meh because theres no skill. Jump in, launch drones, approach can. Other ships are more fun because you have to fly around and react and stuff. I can't recommend it enough. It really is a blast.
---
I think amount would not be fitting since it is ammo based. I could see cycle reduction time being a thing, possibly reload time, but the amount from a battery should stay the same imo
---
Triglavian titan with Triglavian doomsday that does a 360 and if you self destruct, it explodes and wipes a whole system, ccplzzzz
---
I wasn't talking about the amount that a single charge gives you, but rather capacity of a cap booster, so maybe you can fit an extra 800 in a heavy cap booster with a good roll etc
---
http://i.imgur.com/JQr4qHN.gif
---
At least there is Dotlan. But if you want to search and 'show' a system on the ig-map, guess what? You can't.
---
oh man I was looking for that post a few weeks ago
---
Sounds okay in theory, the problem I have is that cap boosters are used primarily to fit the largest booster available into them. Without a comfortable in-between roll for that kind of a stat I feel it would just feel awkward.
---
Hnnnnnnnnnnnnngghhhhhh
---
Grath, stop pretending botting is something you chance upon, it isn't.
---
Probably because you are.
---
Wake me up when that happens.
---
Just do it. Even I managed.
---
Piggybacking on this thread, because I'm coming back from a 2 year hiatus: Where are the small to mid size fights at these days?
---
I doubt this actually applies to Evan, but in general if somebody is spending so much on a product that it's clearly unhealthy, the right thing to do is get them help, not just keep profiting from their problems.
---
Even if the company isn't technically responsible for such things, it's the sort of thing decent human beings generally... O wait, I forgot. I'm talking to EVE players xD
---
You mean... like... Girls?
---
not even mad though
---
So your frigates are putting out enough DPS to break a VNI? I thought frigates were better at webbing them and using the rats DPS. Also, if the beginning, you used a point, got closer then scrammed. Why didn't you fit a point and a web instead? 
---
I'm not questioning your judgment, you obviously know what you are doing. I'd just like to learn what's going on better. 
---
Good video!
---
Yea, but how does this help? You will be bumped again as soon as you warp to the belt. You have to be in the belt with you big fat mining ship to mine anything. You could gank the bumper, but the smart ones will just switch to dirt cheap ships like Stabbers and Omens if they sense danger.
---
There is a reason the "new map" is still called that, despite being in the game for several years
---
Curious the % of players that untick that 
---
Ofc any % would include the 1000 bots, since default is the map enabled
---
How about a sub sale instead?
---
WH
---
The best ideas always come after the gif is done.
---
So does the fc maneuver and everyone else keeps distance from them?
---
Not sure how to interpret that, but thanks!
---
The Dramiel wasn't the best option, but did the job, with time. Retribution has great damage, speed, and range to apply said dps.
---
The Dramiel in the beginning had a scram and a point because some of the VNIs would be right together so I was trying to hold both. Sadly they would atleast have 1 get out and the other be trapped. Also the point covers 1 warp core strength and some of these guys had warp core stabs. The scram was also there incase I got into a fight against a real player
---
Excellent work, keep purging the bot menace!
---
Are you using the timer on leaving system tactic or logoffs?
---
If her age isn't on the clock, then she is ready for the cock
---
lol that sub fleet
---
I've not figured that out.
---
If you think of how, please share!
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
This very rarely works because the rats switch priority to player with more ewar on their ship, which is 99% of the time the person trying to kill the vni.
---
I could watch this shit all day. Very chill soundtrack
