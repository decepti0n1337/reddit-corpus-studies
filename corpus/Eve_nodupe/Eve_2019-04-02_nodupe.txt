Wasnt always a wormholer for 1. For 2, who says wormholes dont have caps?

it fucking got me boys

You do realize....this helps us decipher the language of Triglavians!

Wouldn’t they also have to burn all the way over to it?
---
?
---
Is there any guide on this? Either written or youtube? I´m not quite sure if I get the ninja looting part right... But it sounds really fun.
---
Or when they remote bookmark it. Theres a special place in hell for those people.
---
editing a post is shameful, say what you mean the first time or don't post
---
I like to make token appearances when people bring reddit threads to my attention.
---
Difference between armor and shield sig is marginal
---
You, my friend, speak truth.
---
never was broken people just want it to change to fit there play style now 
---
Biggest KM in whspace other than NS coming in is like ~150, so yeah. 
---
1. Fit is pretty close to a typical lowsec gank niddy.
---
2. Wormholers use their caps to crab or defend, neither of those things are similar to the use of the cap in the OP.
---
YEah, they use ASIC miners these days. 
---
1 not at all. 
---

---
2 many of us also own stashes of caps in lowsec for drunken roams
---
You can just leave an alt on it and cash out lonnnng before they can burn the distance. Anyone at all can trigger the payout.
---
will fix thank you
---
Wouldn't hate it if asset safety was a service module.
---
 When the concept of SSF  started becoming more popular in POE I also thought about it in EVE however I couldn't justify spending the needed time for it.
---
 You'd probably start off doing mining to build your basic starting frigates and ammo  killing adequate npcs to fit said ships with modules they drop and salvaging to build your rigs.
---
 As for t2 modules most likely early on stealing it from people dying in pvp .
---
 Overall you could go pretty high on the ship tree you could even get to build yourself a dreadnought or carrier and make the whole fit.
---
yah people realised that you can move a ship to whoever you want in a citadel and if its in wh space when the cit dies the ship is ejected in a can as the guy who you delivered the ship to so when it gets blown up its marked down as being someone elses and not yours.
---
think it was tishu who first crossed that moral line and did it to vile rat.
---
I’m doing this. My rule is no buying or selling anything. The only exception I allow myself is skills. Basically it’s living that Velator lifestyle. But my hope is to one day kill a newbro carrying a frigate bpo! Someday!
---
I'd love to have that sheet
---
When bullshittery leaks into local.
---
About tree fiddy.
---
1. Yeah.
---
2. Learn to use markdown so you can format your points better.
---
3. Owning and knowing how to fit are two completely unrelated things.
---
Nice try there buckaroo.
---
ccp howard would like to know your location
---
Or you'll lose it by landing on a cyno that brings in a bunch of dreads and get flamed by armchair experts about how your fit isn't right but offer nothing in argument as to how it's wrong.
---
Removed? Aww.
---
I put a lot of planning into this. I was glad someone noticed it.
---
"Meet EvEletics"
---
I got home and ran the numbers, and to have fighters equal to that of a Nyx, all you need is the drone durability rig, leaving plenty of room for slaves + armor pumps. CCP is definitely going to have to revisit this to make them more competitive vs. slaves.
---
Going out on a limb here: when going for election politicians are usually given instructions to not make public comments without prior Public Relations spin being applied. It’s to ensure nothing damning is said or prevent any type of shame, scandal, etc. Nothing gets you out of an election faster than a scandal, although recent history has shown it might actually help. 
---
You shouldn't have stopped posting. Who the fuck cares about "updates" when those bots are still allowed to exist.

I'll go so far as to add, young red bellied newts (when they still have gill frills) are substantially more adorable than axolotl at any age. Those creepy ass doll eyes are just wrong.

I'll come out for you ;)
---
You counter it the exact same way it was setup.  Not hard really, iirc the dude did it in a few days.
---
the funny part is stainguy often has good posts, almost always followed up be someone commenting on being suprised by the good post.  dude just knows the game, and knows his bit, and is sticking to both.
---
Come get me. Unlike wormholes, my space doesn't move around.
---
Hey not gonna tell you where to go or how to play, but give it a fair shot.  The game is amazing.
---
Saying you were told not to speak about a thing is just as damning. Then sucking that dick for all its worth? Sellouts and shills the lot. 
---
The lesson here is: "Bots make CCP more money than you do. So fuck off and like it omegabitches" or in political terms: "I was actually asked to stop posting about this"
---
EVE currently has far too much space, there's no reason to fight for anything and no reasonable way for CCP to shrink the easily available sov without being unfair.
---
A massive trig invasion that occupies unused space, requires active effort to keep removed (doesn't dissapear with time), actively bashes citadels that otherwise no one could be bothered with (lol asset safety) could be pretty neat. Make their fleets drop worthwhile loot for the production of advanced trig ships. Farther from the front your space is, the less often it's breached and the more desirable it becomes for ratting, creating desire for those systems. Longer the trig hold the system the more entrenched they become, requiring cooperation to finally purge.
---
Plus, it could be great for the game lore which has been super unloved compared to the early EVE days.
---
Engineering Complexes will lock builds and drop all the components of in-process jobs or completed items of undelivered jobs at the time  of reinforcement. I have seen nyxes drop from abandoned Sotios during an invasion. What part of this is much different, apart from the timer mechanics?
---
theres a seller on the forums asking for 700b

Damn, using corpses to manufacture quafe zero would be pretty awesome

If this is serious, that’s really unfortunate. If it’s a troll like it seems like, does he need a loan?
---
Yeah I'm not sure you can mitigate much if they're using faction, but definitely think about adding missile type/weapons to your in-space damage logs as it can really help sometimes.
---
Yes they are very cute overall. However their smile is inferior to that of an axolotl. Although rough skinned newt's eyes are very adorable.

It's serious. Not a troll.

Probably shouldn't be on EVE if he tried suicide over loss of assets. Also we don't know anything about him or why he was banned, for all I know he did RMT.
---
The benefits really aren't that great, you're talking about a zealot going from 1.7kms to 19kms with a nano, don't forget they take up fitting slots, which sure you can fit 3 but you're losing so much DPS or tank for really minimal changes to the hulls performance. It's balanced just fine.
---
That... is genius.

That’s really too bad then, hope everything works out for the dude.

I'm deeply sorry that someone chose to take his own life, and I can't even start to understand how it must to be to actually live with that from now on; to him my best wishes and hopes for a speedy recovery. Give him all the help you can, he's gonna need it.
---
That being said, blaming that on the devs or the community is a simplistic (and shitty) thing to do. I know you are in pain atm and you need to blame someone, but if you really want to help him you need to understand that noone kills himself over being banned on a video game or recieving accusations (false or not) about RMT; that's just what triggered it.
---
You're right. I don't know what else was going on in his life. I just know this:  
---
  
---
Before he was banned, he was (outwardly) happy, full of energy, always there for a joke or wisecrack.  
---
After he was banned, he was a wreck.

it's the same reason some people shoot nakeds in rust, you never know which of them is gonna have 9K stone farmed up for no reason.

---
notes about this strat:
---
- only really works when starting from a speed of 0, otherwise it just slows down your align time since your ship needs to turn.
---
- don't keep your mwd hot. one cycle on off should (if using an appropriately sized mwd) put you above 75% of your non-mwd speed, thus letting you insta warp to whatever you are aligned to, without flinging you far away from where you want to be or giving you a bigger signature (quicker to target)
---
the best answer 
---
I also recommend the uni, they have opportunities for everything pretty much, and are generally super helpful.
---
Im doing something similar. I have a philosophy of "You can fly it if you can build it" which applies to mods and rigs too. In some cases ill go all out and buy stuff from the market.. but i want to say that at least &gt;90% of everything i lose is built from scratch by me.

These guys are all in the same corp as the ones you posted. He had like 30 procs jet canning, a haw dread sitting there with a boost rorq, an MTU gathering containers, and an obelisk warping back and forth to a citadel picking up all the ore.
---
The no-docking sounds like a good idea, the increased fuel costs or similar is bullshit.
---
And why do people keep making such complicated proposals for dplexing? Just add fucking NPCs that you need to kill to capture the plex... you know, exactly like offensive plexing but with the rats warping in to kill the defender. There, no more stabs, no more empty hulls and no more swarms of farmers that add nothing to lowsec.

---
- I find that there's much more of a "team" feeling.
---
- PVE is great isk even though I rarely do it.
---
- I've been exposed to and have flown a ton of different fits. A lot of that has to do with fighting out numbered and also different wormhole effects.
---
- No Asset Safety.
---
Cons:
---
- Scanning out chains isn't very interesting.
---
- Logistics can be a pain, but not too bad once you get used to it.
---
- Getting podded out sucks.
---
- No Asset Safety

After being a null line member my first 3 years I got really bored. I decided I might as well try out wormholes before I quit. It turned out to be the best decision for my preferred playstyle. I've been in wormholes now for 2-3 years.

The two npc's in infinite war with each other has been mentioned by Crosi a long time ago.  It will work, since they both will have a very small amount of dps, but CCP will have to rework some of the plex mechanics to recognize which rat is present rather than if the rat itself is there at all.  It would be easier to just force clearing the rat by both sides and call it a day, imo.

That being said, there are ships that you want to have aligned, because they are expensive, but want to keep still, for dumping ore in them or staying in range of things.  There is a rig that will increase your mass, making you move slower so you can be aligned at a much much lower speed.  The Higgs Anchor is the rig, would not have done much for you in your scenario above, but if you progress to big mining vessels and support they might

Hey you know how it is, everybody “knows” everything..
---
An interesting concept, but you'd probably have to go through some really esoteric means to progress past T1 destroyers, like either grinding Abyssal Frigate sites or doing Missions to get a Faction/Pirate Cruiser unless you want to grind out a hefty amount to shell out for the BPO. Hell, you can't even do stuff like salvage or explore for isk, since you can't sell to player orders. 
---
It's less SSF in POE (which has a wide number of crafting options that can help supply you with the necessary equipment) and more like Swampletics (unable to access a lot of the mechanics that help build your character)
---
Thinking about it, the easiest way to get a cruiser would probably be to run the Guristas Epic Arc to get the Gila BPC at the end, or to do FW a lot in order to get enough LP to buy a faction cruiser.

While reddit isn't the best place (usually) to find help and such, Eve's community is full of people in and out of space that love to teach new people. Get in that Vigil and get in fleet, wherever you land, you'll get the itch like the rest of us lost souls and be just fine.

It's ridiculously good, if a tad clichéd. It requires no training to fly and can use every weapon system equally well.
---
When I made Tank Skank I did something like this in the early game doing missions. Only taking what the agents gave me and drops from wrecks. It was an interesting, if short lived, diversion.
---
I lived in a wh for almost a year at one point and we had a very descriptive way for naming wh. I tried to teach one of my corpies (who's played as long as me and is as skilled as i am) the naming convention. He just won't do it. So we get shitty bookmarks. So when I ask him to try and follow the convention I feel ridiculous, because he should understand perfectly why it's important.

Your ship is a point AND a velocity vector (the model is irrelevant, correct - but the velocity is NOT. you can see the velocity vector with the tactical overlay as the blue arrow coming from your ship). If you have ZERO velocity, no vector at all, your next alignment will determine the direction of the vector and you will instantly "align", needing just to speed up to 75% speed to enter warp to that alignment.
---
If you DO have velocity, your ship needs to rotate the vector to the new alignment - this takes time and is a function of ship agility (and mass, I believe). MWD reduces agility significantly, which is why you dont want to use it when changing direction - in this case, the ship model IS relevant since it mostly shows where you're going (but really, you care about the blue arrow in tactical overlay).
---
If you're above 75% max speed, and aligned, you will warp as soon as the server registers the command to warp to your alignment.
---
I'm not a full time wormholer, but looks like there are basically 2 wormhole coalitions, HKLazers being the top dog and IH/Holesale/HC etc the other. They keep doing things to each other. But I like how whenever HKLazers evict one of these it's argued that "they deserve it", meanwhile IH etc. never cry that their evictors "evicted valuable PvP from wormholes". 
---
No one is above the eviction. Just stop this boring moral high ground claims and deal with it.

---
Then doesn't bother to actually say what ESS means, for the players who are new that would be affected by others using it.
---
This is really nice. Good job showing off how pretty the stargates are these days!
---
You and I have had discussions before on evictions and we have vastly different opinions. In the interest of not rehashing that I'll simply say that there's nowhere near the amount of bad blood between HK and INHE(this current iteration. The current INHE is not the same INHE that fed a keepstar in c6 space) their was between the Russians of old and outlaws. This is from talking to numerous people across HK, Hawks, Novac and even a few from INHE that frequent English speaking forums.
---
And on to this idea of coalitions, I don't think so really. Holesale was allied with Holesale. They supported dura and outlaws post rage eviction because it suited them. The same with the others. Allies of convniance. Furthermore, the groups you're mentioning, they're not actually involved in wormholes in terms of fighting. They base out of a wormhole to hit nullsec with a static and gank C5 site runners. That's literally it. The other groups you've mentioned are actually wormhole groups. And I know you've a different opinion than... Just about everyone else on what a wormhole groups is and how fighting in wormholes doesn't mean anything and etc etc etc.
---
But the fact remains, you're not a wormholer. You're not part of that community. You're not interacting with these people. There's a consensus amongst wormholers for a reason. So it's ignorant to assume this just because you're biased against HK and Hawks.

"GAURNETEED" fort kill?
---
Gf, at first NCPL were melting eagles, a few good bombing runs by init and goons helped wiped the rattles. GF
---
started out as our small 180 man Liberty Squad in eagles, vs 4-500 nc, pl, ph and a bot fleet.  In the end we got a reinforcement ferox fleet from Delve and some good bombing runs from our bros and wiped out the rattlesnake fleet almost completely.  
---
And the Fortizar survived the hull timer, oh they also had 70 or so caps on standby and still didnt kill the fortizar.

please be kind. they dont have anymore memes Q\_Q

Early on i considered buying a venture BPO, a thrasher BPO, and module blueprints to suit and taking them down to Stain to live in a NPC station. I flew down to the station to scout out my route and died like five times to gate camps before reaching it. Didnt think it was going to be feasible.

Perhaps true on the forum, but the Discord has a dedicated newbie-help channel with a no-trolling attitude. It's there for new players and returning vets.
---
This is just wrong. If you are stationary, it will take you the same amount of time to enter warp no matter which way your ship is facing.
---
&gt; Much of the delay inherent in a warpout is the act of getting your ship pointed in the right direction. Pre-aligning removes this part of the escape delay. 
---
Again, wrong. Only if you are moving will it take longer to change your alignment and enter warp.
---
neat and also cool

PS: More often than not I take part in these evictions by defending the Holesale/Outlaws/IH side. That presumes interaction.

&gt; because you're biased against HK and Hawks.

Not really. I just dont like the virtue signaling that whenever HKLazers evict people "they do gods work by evicting people who don't offer content". Meanwhile people they evict use those wormholes for content and pvp as well (in the sense that it's still better they are in these wormholes rather than not). Just not the kind HKLazers want (e.g. c5-c6/null ragerolling and evictions rather than prearranging fights with people into whom they rolled).

So far people have revived mails from the [Perun Clade](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/Triglavian/98afafdsfrsscv.mp4) and the [Veles Clade](https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/Triglavian/98afafdsfrsscv.mp4).

Fwiw stainguy is polish, you moron
---
It was only a 180 man eagle fleet on our side to begin the fight, and then the reinforcement fleet in feroxes got there part way through. Either way, it's more fighting outshipped than outnumbered, since they had two battleship fleets and all we had was battlecruiser and below.
---
my self destruct involves moonshine and whatever stimulants the doctor ordered
---
Mmm
---
Also, did you guys tell pando we had a second fleet on standby? He's adament we had a raven fleet and a muninn fleet at the same time. Like, boosh ravens are big gay, but there was only that, and I was literally octo-boxing. I don't remember a second fleet? 
---
Or is he just retarded and forgot we reshipped? 
---
Are you unironically bragging about us failing to kill something and losing nothing when you guys just failed at killing something that WASNT trying to run away and still managed to lose over 50bil in the process?
---
because I don't like fishing expeditions
---
basically some greasy keyboard warriors thought it was a smooth move to threaten me and claim I was "mentally ill" after I stole some of their eve stuff. 
---
🙏
---
They are stupidly rare, only 50 in existence. And beyond the gimmick of 10 drones at once, pretty mediocre. They have been hanger queens since they were released, and a good portion of them are owned by players who won Eve years ago.
---
So it's not surprising at all that the last kill by one was in 2016. I'm actually shocked someone undocked it at all.
---
No screenshots of what you stole?
---
Right? I think they’re crazy to the point that when they do shit like that people think it’s a trap and avoid them when in reality they just don’t give a fuck.
---
In general I actually like the Russians in this game, from my experience at least, they’re quite fun and chill.. I remember I accidentally ended up in some Russians wormhole and was chatting with a guy that was using google translate but we had a decent laugh..
---
It's just a prank bro!
---
Man it's a weird feeling for Horde. You let a character in who literally named himself "A Walksir" and you turn around and watch him awox your fleet on a strat op.
---
You'd think they would see that coming.
---
I can confirm oldman_stone isn't a bot but holy shit the bots are more convincing.

Dude who last used undocks thw victor at ship quite often by looks of it.

Goons aren't the ones having to schlep across regions to defend shitty renter space. Our morale is fine but thanks for the concern.

lol wut?

Lot's of people lie for all kinds of reasons. I don't ask why, I just ask for proof. The thread would be much spicier if it had some.

Do you, by some chance, happen to sell avocados as well?

Sounds like we have low moral.

I can edit the video mate ;)

Please do so.

Hey selling them is wrong. Give them out to newbies instead. Everyone deserves companion.

---
Still not funny.

Gotta know when to let it go. :(
---
FW was and still is realy fun! I dont see what so broken about it but there is not as many people playing in it as there was back in 2015
---
Alright.
---
 You will need week old white bread, rice you cooked 3 days ago, canned black beans, dry rotini pasta, a banana, saltine crackers, mayonaise, and tobasco sauce (don't forget capers if you are feeling fancy). 
---
Cook the rotini at the beginning, follow the instructions on the box (about 15 minutes of cook time) but **do not add any salt.** Salt in the water will keep the rotinis from sticking to the saltines. The texture is important.
---
Mix the ancient rice and canned beans in a separate bowl with a 1:1 ratio. Take your bean rice and make a layer 1/2 an inch thick on your base bread slice.
---
Next, layer those saltines so they thinly cover the bean rice.
---
Now comes the compicated bit. You need to align the rotinis diagonally across the sandwich and lather those puppies up with tabasco. Tabasco binds this sammy together, without it you may as well make a **boring AF** turkey club, pubbie shit.
---
Now you need to place that peeled (optional) banana directly over the diagonal lin of rotini. 
---
NOW LATHER THAT TOP SLICE WITH MAYO AND SLAM IT DOWN LIKE THE SHOTS YOU TAKE TO FORGET THAT UNKLE KYLE STOLE YOUR COLLEGE FUND TO BET ON HORSES, WON, AND DIDN'T SHARE SHIT LIKE THE WORTHLESS WASTE OF SKIN THAT HE IS.
---
Make sure to apply downward pressure like when applying a CPU cooler so the banana spreads evenly.
---

Sitting 0 will align faster to warp, unless you warp to something in line with your direction while moving, but this wont work if a Sabre lands or decloaks, best bet is to orbit 500m while hacking with 3 over drives on, something decloaks or lands just push off and hit your MWD and OH if you can. anything decloaking cant lock fast enough to be in scram range and just burn out of disruptor range.
---
Please ignore all the ihubs and structures burning in a dumpster fire in the spire.
---
So little? These shills want our support to run for CSM while openly admitting to being silenced on certain topics. You kidding me? Burn these fuckers to the ground... CSM2019 candidate? More like perma-shill shunned from eve candidate NOW. 
---
I'd rather goonswarm and those fucking spodspergers run the entire show than Elo_Clown and his likes of his ilk. 
---
no this is not the best way, if a Cloaked Dictor uncloaks and bubbles up you'll choke and die, speed rules in hacking, orbit use over drives and burn out if someone lands or decloaks, they wont lock you fast enough for a scram, and very few will have weapons to track you as you push over 15km
---
What if it was a robot that is sitting at a computer typing these comments? I'm just saying, we can't be sure it isn't a bot.
---
He want all the corps assets,  corp didn't want to give them to him
---
Honestly reads like a shitty april 1st post
---
Ehhh, cant compare much to 2015, but now? No, theres not much fun about going into novice plexes with T1 frigs and finding pirate/navy frigs, and neutral RR alts to burn through, in addition to your WT. Smalls arent much better, and almost no one in the others unless it's a random dplexing for better LP that warps out either when you enter the system.or show up on dscan.
---
Not much fun with LP rewards being farmed by people dplexing in near 100% safety, flooding the market.
---
Not much fun when enrolled in FW and your primary enemy is your own faction because they're too lazy to look for WT and dont give 2 shits about the negligible standing loss.
---
Or the small gangs camping acceleration gates to the complexes in advanced ships flat out preventing you from even entering.
---
At some point many people realize they need to move to a quieter system and hope for the odd fight every few hours from opposing factions and deal with the more frequent fights from your own militia, and local pirate corps (whatever, that's expected until you can make nice), or you leave FW and dont really PvP until you're flying T2 ships reliably, at which point you've spent months in the game unable to experience and learn from content in cheaper alternatives and get into a corp basically doing the same thing that was happening to you. Or maybe you decide low-sec is BS and just jump to null corps.
---
Theres content to be had there, sure. But the progression is completely missing. You go from high sec to null/WH, and can completely skip low unless you run missions, in which case, it's more lucrative to do so in high sec to avoid losses from other corps. That's not risk/reward, because the reward is all in staying away from everyone to farm LP, which is virtually 0 risk, and 0 pvp.
---
That's not FW. That's an elaborate form of mission running disguised as PvP content.
---
Actually winning Eve
---
Stands for Encounter Surveillance System.  Depending on the faction you buy (caldari, gallente, etc) it converts some of the rat bounties into LP that you can cash out as tags which have a higher value than the rat bounties used to create them.  They aren't risk free though, anyone can cash them out, not just the people who deployed them
---
Its too ingrained for them now, too much a part of their identity that they let anyone that applies in, either they figure out how to cope with it, or it destroys them.
---
No middle ground.
---
PM me for GSF botting program download link
---
1) Read the whole thing, still didn't understood why you did it. Why does any of the backstory (e.g. the CSM race) even matter in this?
---
2) You basically showed just one thing, that they apparently know you moved to Texas (RL friends of friends, social networks, posting on places with the new IP, using twitter, instagram etc with location enabled etc etc).
---
3) how " Deuteronomy 25:11-12" is related to stalking?

4) you are painting the picture as like in the movies there was a tinted window car down the street always sitting there, but never said anything why it was weird and what made you think they were actually stalking you.

HACS are not outshipped. I suppose you will call 100 bombers against battleships being "upshipped" as well.
---
How is that exactly?

all you got was 500 bil?
---
people evolved there play style if they hit with a Nerf or something people will mostlikly change for the worst till there is no one left. there is a reason why there is only 25k players half alts 
---
I mean, those snakes ate 35 bombs straight to the face and didn't die, the only reason they went down was the combination of fleets whose total number was like 3x that one fleet's size. Maybe I'm wrong but that reeks of superior tactics with weaker ships, to me.
---
I'll take it for 27 isk
---
HACs are pretty great vs BS guns, is what he means by not really below.
---
I know that feeling, I've been thinking about resubbing more and more these days ... but I mostly work long hours and don't need more stress doing pvp fights after work.
---
So I've been tossing around the idea of resubbing just to mine in nullsec for a chill alliance. Wonder if it's worth paying $13 a month just to chill out and shoot virtual space rocks lol.

Heyheyhey... Overgeneralizing much there ;)  
---
I know enough ppl who "just play their game" around PvE, totally accepting that there are "that tougher NPCs" that occasionally drop by tryin to give them a hard time and have some odd chatbot with tourette attached. Tactics differ... Some fight that "NPCs", some try to avoid combat, some just shrug and say "who cares, I got another 20 VNIs fitted in stock".
---
Some of that ppl even participate in actual PvP-fleets, when its about defending the homelands, or strategic objectives. But not just for "Uuuugh, I wanz kill someone, lulz".
---
You re right though that demanding the game to safe them from PvP if they dont want it is bonkers. Its EVE, if someone wants to avoid gun-PvP he/she needs to play tactic PvP, aka avoid being a target or avoid getting in gunrange of folks.But I see issues on both sides of the medal there... Especially here around reddit, where the "I want to be able to kill everyone everywhere with minimal effort"-people meet the "If I dont want to be shot ppl should not be able to shoot me"-people. None of both extremes works and the balance will always be dipping a bit to the one or the other side and if its dipping too extreme THEN CCP needs to step in to restore some balance between hunters and prey.
---
But back to that "toxicity of non-PvPers": I think its cause the sort of "humor" I ve seen around several PvP-groups is... not everyones taste. What is seen as "funny lil smacktalk" amongst some folks is considered a very non-game, very heavy personal insult by the recipient eventually. And at that point some ppl try reacting on the levels they ve been talked at, without having any clue about that "sort of humor" and where the attackers borders of "whoa, thats too much" are. Humans, social stuff, difficult... ;)

Very cool, very legal
---
Bombs apply perfectly to battleships. Battleships can't lock bombers in time before they warp out. Bombers are 100% a counter to Battleships as long as you destroy the dessie wing first.
---
Reread it twice. 
---
I can only conclude he has mental problems.
---
The coffee was cold.

The fact you can put a fit, used ship in a sma, go afk and lose it? Wouldn't lose it if he put it in a keepstar

Yeah, who the fuck is that random crying anyway

And what is the message o poorest of thieves?

I have to admit, I was a little confused when I saw the whole "appear instantly out of warp" bug on display, then you jumped on TRI and I realized it was from a bit back. Nice vid tho )))

yes.. yes you were in this corporation.
---
except it's not
---
&gt; I long con heisted some video game assets and some corporation members decided it was fair game to doxx and threaten to find me in real life, even going as far to note real world locations I have been recently. 
---
Take it a few notches further and report it to CCP. CCP is pretty hard handed when it comes to things of this nature and anyone that ends up being in their crosshairs very much deserves it.
---
LOL! Sisters of Eve want their flair back

Hes talking about dark filaments dude. T4s are greatly pushing it cause you gotta sacrifice at least 2 slots, either mid or rig or any combination of. And T5s just forget it.

Hope you got them but Shadow.tech is a godsend for that. 
---
Third-party tldr:
---
1. Man claims he decided to do a big heist on a corp that couldn’t find a home in New Eden.
---
2. Corp eventually lands in Init.
---
3. Brisc elected to CSM (relevance?)
---
4. Man flips some structures and awoxes super, then is paranoid about something (that he doesn’t explain) enough to move out of state.
---
5. One dude from corp later mentions Texas.
---
6. Obv a conspiracy (?)
---
If you're gonna go this expensive change your battery to faction, you'll have less fitting reqs, more cap, more resist.
---
As for your rig ? Are you having trouble hitting small fast targets ? Then missile Velocity for darks, or just old fashioned rigor rig.
---
You can use more cap, this looks weak vs neut spawns. So maybe a cap rig ?
---
You also have an EM hole and low shield volume so maybe one of those ? 
---
Try them out see how it works out.
---
Yes, but of course. Why do you even ask?
---
Join E-UNI and after a few weeks join their lowsec campus
---
Yep, but important split will be between this and DD battle where 2 fleets are shooting each other at almost maximum range.     
---
Quite often dropping dread bomb in the middle of this blob will be impossible.         
---
Eviction means that the attacker has to be a larger group which will spend the whole weekend - or several days depending on how many structures you have - in your hole. They have to keep a fleet active for 23.5h a day and no one of that group can do anything else with those toons.
---
It ruins everyone's time. 
---
To get properly evicted you have to piss off a couple people very badly or be a super valuable Target. 
---
Also when in lower class wh, build a fax and show it from time to time so people know that it will be super aids to evict you. 
---
Nice ppl all over new eden, just got to get to know people

I have a serious request for you.         
---
Can you ask CCP to introduce legit way to obtain a Revenant BPC from the Sansha Nation?         
---
Currently a player affiliated with Sansha Nation cannot obtain one.       
---
This is something with **the lowest priority** but if you could just mention this to CCP.       
---
Thx
---
Feel free to contract them to "Sacah" anywhere in hs, I buy for 500k isk each, and will pay extra for interesting ones. I pay an average of 1.5mil per corpse to my suppliers, this is for quality corpses, no duplicates and no few week old toons.
---
Thanks for the info. I don't know much about wh space.
---
"Gnagnagna CCP is not fixing shit" well come there and do you part in helping if you want to help the game.
---
No. If you right click on a wormhole and select 'save as' it's just "Wormhole"
---
Exactly like that, nothing before or after. 
---
If i need to pay to play the game in omega, CCP can give me something on TQ for work i do for them on the test server.

Proof. I guess it's not a gif, but eh.

You get 2M SP on Sisi, which opens up avenue for testing shit before on you get it on Tranquility (for example, capitals, or marauders, or stuff like that), and you get paid with helping your game in a way that cannot be done otherwise. Unless you want CCP to try random fixes on the live server.

So then how do those snakes tank 35 bombs? At best, those snakes have 200k ehp, and 35 bombs are doing over 300k. I'm not exactly disputing what you're saying, I agree bombs are a good way to counter battleships, but saying they are 100% a counter to all Battleships is just not correct. Why do you think you never see bombers wipe a Macharial fleet?
---
Expect to see them at a time where eve online is actually a game set in the past using antequated technology and the concept of capsuleer immortality is a quaint outdated concept as we all live in the cloud watching vintage vr porn from 2981

Well duh. Anything implemented correctly wouldn't be a waste of time obviously.
---
Sure, but their damage is not really comparable.
---
You dont get it, right? THAT IS WHY IT IS SO FREAKING HORRIBLE. That's the whole point. You never remote save, because it is retarded. That is why I am triggered when somebody does this.
---
underrated comment.
---
Very nice and heterosexual
---
Yeah I don't agree with everyone but it will be nice to organize everything and submit it, and it's great that the csm and devs joined in
---
I mean, I thought your complaint was he didn't name it - the fact he remote saved it is retarded, yeah. I can't remember the last time that was an issue for me. Probably 2016? 
---
Kinda forgot that was even a thing. 
---
Naming included saving from ov like i didnt even thought avout separating that thought because iz's like ingrained in my brain at this point.
---
Yeah. If you can save it it means you have scanned already and done the "hard" part but then want to save 10 seconds by not warping and saving directly  i mean you cn even do that while scanning other stuff, you dont even waste time at all. Only the 1 second you need to move your mouse to 'warp to'.
---
What is EHP of aeon without the "armor slave set?"

what if i make a post about lowsec being overun by silly FW rules when im not in a FW army. i did not enlist therefore it should not affect me. who is right?
---
He said interesting ones, not annoying. 
---
I totally agree on the current Tier system - it rewards those that join the winning side and the loosing side is crushed into the ground even more. At that point FW just becomes an LP farm for the winning side with the high payout bonuses.

And i dont see many silly rules imposed on you.
---
The only ships that are hard to aquire are limited ones like AT or a Guardian Vexor.  
---
Ships have been balanced around skills for years before extractors became a thing.  
---
Sure, there were groups with capitals back then, but there was an even bigger amount of people who stayed in subcaps because maxing out subcapital weapons even on battlecruisers took a long time.
---
structures? fuel costs, its not own-able space. its npc space that FW groups have their little plex fun in.
---
eve is a sandbox, and is designed to allow you to go to nullsec. capture space and create a space that is what you want it to be.

Well you get a higher volley with BS, but you trade that for the ability to track basically anything with medium guns. DPS is only better at point blank and they actually loose out at range, but hey DPS is irrelevant for fleet combat anyways. Given 100 Eagles vs 100 BS I'm willing to beat the eagles will beat the BS nine out of ten times thanks to ADC &amp; 2-shotting BS.

I saw a guy running clone soldiers in 0.1 in an AB daredevil so it's definitely possible, might be sticky in a destroyer if you land too far off on the initial warp in. 0.1 ones have an optimal of ~90km and will use warp disruptors at 24km. You need probably around 350-400 dps to kill them efficiently.
---
I will admit, a large portion of my bookmarks are just called 'wormhole'
---
Such a handy way to bookmark return. Jump wormhole, name it 'wormhole' (aka default save option). Nice and easy.
---
Plus you can make some a+ joke like 'all wormholes lead to x' 
---
Nanofags are under the impression that Carriers are only for shooting undefended structures from 200km.
---
They cry that everybody drops supers on them but they never stay to fight a subcap fleet.
---
They only want easy targets like ratters and no way to defend against their garbage roams.
---
This assumes that all holes in J Space are unused by anyone else. All fights happen on fresh holes huh?
---
There was at one point where 75% of that Donut was blue.Goons and the CFC(?) controlled virtually everything worth controlling.

Here are the full logs between myself and Phoenix when I tried to get the structures transferred back to INIT:  [https://pastebin.com/zFiVXfm5](https://pastebin.com/zFiVXfm5)

Screenshot from the start of the discord convo:  [https://imgur.com/a/yUn2dXv](https://imgur.com/a/yUn2dXv)   
---
TLDR: The guy has some serious mental problems, this was very much not a long con he just lost it after seeing too many UFOs or something and is now doing an attention grab. Since the heist he has contacted both his old corp and INIT lead on multiple occasions looking for attention and for someone to admit how relevant he is.  
---
Hopefully he gets some help IRL.

---
Idk, what sort of retard chain do you see that's half massed?
---
Okay so it's 51% mass. boom 50 cruisers each way. Still a thousand bombers each way. Still 100 cruisers if you scan a new exit (and that's not hard)
---
Like, mass limits aren't why you have smaller fights. It's the fact most corps don't have 100 rl people in it. Tdsin and pospy are the only two I know of with 100 rl people. 
---
Hi I'm 12 and what is this?
---
TBH, after reading the whole thing, the only conclusion that sticks out is that you may be mentally ill.  The wall of text does not have a particularly coherent point.
---
Making dead bodies to a commodity u can reprocess to boosters or somerhing useful will insentivies more killing in EvE I approve 
---
An eagle is stronger than a Ferox?
---
I can tell it has a Sansha touch to it but judging by the rest of the hull, this could possibly be a new faction? The Russian federation possibly? 😂
---
I don't agree with this at all, but if you're going around evicting groups hit Sleeper Dreams next
---
i was not dick to everyone in this section. just fuck off . the dude above said the man disguise as women in this game adn i told him no. then you came out of nowhere and  shoved your tiny ass in the argument for no reason at all. i was asking for help throughout all the comments wtf are you talking about this thread is all about help

Hello i saw summer patch notes..are these the ones ur referring in OP? .. if so , the plex prices are going to go up to 5m and more? What you think?
---
Darkness. showing up in corms.. why would anyone even stay in GOTG these days
---
I think I'd have to disagree with you. Frequently we have been unable to kill t1 battleships reliably before reps hit even with 100+ eagles. And maybe the range is an issue against Ishtars or Cerbs, but it's quite a bit less dps when you have to pull range and use spike to get that sig tank working nicely vs battleship guns.
---
I didn't say Ferox, I said battlecruiser. I would say t2 battlecruisers would be considered stronger than a t2 cruiser, wouldn't you?
---
Nice! 
---
Hey peeps.
---
 Ok so iv read through all of this and seen the video. May i add that the creation of the video is very well put together and a congrats to the producer is defiantly needed.
---
However.. iv found some inconsistencies with the info in this reddit post.  
---
1.  We destroyed the power shields of each citadel in the system. We had information on the strength of the defense forces and expected to get a good fight with using capital ships. However, the defenders lurked, clearly counting on the reinforcement of their allies. We are faced with a similar tactic when evicting another team - BTLH  
---
INHL knew from the point off seeding the hole there game plan was to wait till we was out on an OP of some kind so we had no chance to defend. 
---
2.   After another day, both fortizars fell without much resistance: [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75966677/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75966677/) and [https://zkillboard.com/kill/75968264/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75968264/). Personally, I was   
---
disappointed. 
---
As stated above - INHL knew at the point of attack that SD was out on another OP with most the corps MAINS. So decided to strike and gain hole control.
---
Now this tactic is nothing new and well put together because lets face it no corp wants to fail. Having said that the tactic worked well and yes INHL evicted SD   
---
pixels from a system in-game. So well done to INHL for that. INHL knew that if SD was NOT home to defend. That like corps in the past they would have failed if   
---
we was home. So to state these inconsistency in this reddit post is merely wrong and not called for.
---
With the greatest respect i think like meany others do, that INHL should retract this statement as they are dis-respecting them self's
---
Stranger Danger is a great corp and have some amazing people here and this has defiantly brought us more together as a corp and friends. This minor upset in   
---
the game is part and parcel of the WH life. And we will rebuild and sharply move on as its our first proper eviction after so meany other eviction temps have failed   
---
in the past. 
---
I would like to thank all the guys who came out to help us in this time. 
---
INHL you will see us again and hopefully we can fight instead of you constantly turning us down. Congrats on your OP "Expect us"   
---
shut up idiot

You cannot support this with just drops, also building full set from drops takes time, a lot of time.

I bought 10.000 plex when these were 4.5 M just 3 o 4 days ago .. im seeing that atm these are at 4.3 m ... what you suggest? To hold on and wait the increase? Or there is the possibility that ccp could do something? And if ccp do sonething what could do? 
---
The cyno jammer , which have be installed a couple hour prior of the fight, have trolled their caps deployment a little too.

The moment you have played the neutral card during the Horde/Black Legion vs Dead Coalition, you have ask for it.

People lose ships in combat, some are just dumb and spend a bunch on subcaps when they could have bought a dread and killed more than a couple frigates and t1 cruisers.
---
What is the point of enjoying anything, really? We're all gonna eventually die anyway.
---
Ships die, that's the game.
---
And they paid you for the privilege!

I would do it for free.

Your morale is fine. It's your morals we doubt.

What EVE needs is to nuke PLEX and go back to just sub for cash. No more 20 rorq multiboxers, no more afk vni empires, the economy finally deflates and all is good again.
---
As many eviction attempts SD had survived over the years, we were on borrowed time anyways. I haven't been active in a few months, but I still talk to everyone, and I can tell you this,  SD spirit isnt broken. They some emotionally stable mfers.

Well, then it's an elaborate one.  I can testify to the structure bashes at least. 
---
Heh, nice sleuthing
---
no because he lost plenty of structure that we killed the week after.
---
I don't look at the plex market as much. 
---
Currently it is heavily over speculated by players and heavily dependent on the CCP actions.    
---
Simply to say - plex should be much cheaper, but players are working to keep the price high, at the same time current CCP actions help with maintaining the high price.      
---
If CCP decide that they are losing to many players due to high plex prices one action can to remove big part of the current inflated price.        
---
&gt;Idk, what sort of retard chain do you see that's half massed often?
---
So people actually using wormholes makes a chain retarded? LOL.... Yeah! Sure!!
---
The number of times we've had holes close on us during a 10 v 10 fight.. You sound like someone who doesn't actually live in wormholes. 
---
Mods delete this trash.
---
that is why you haul it out in an overpropped ship cruising at 10k/s
---
A 10v10 fight? Can't remember the last time I had one of those.
---
Maybe corps like you won't undock with us in chain? Who knows. Still, I've spent, uh.. 3 years in wspace, 0 in low or null I guess. Last time I remember chain mass fucking me was moving a sleip fleet through a c1. 
---
I think nobody understood your message. i read 10 times your text and still doesnt understand why you backstabb your corp.
---
At least backstabbing someone is never a good things, i have said the same when the Judge did it to CO2.
---
The only backstabber that i understand was the PL guy that got his titan scammed first 10 years before by PL. And also in this case, the guys that stole his titan was not the same than the PL from these days.
---
A structure that produces extra salty popcorn

how many actually bother to take the time to do that?

With that many goon spais in Horde I can fully understand why you choose not to shoot at Horde.

So since we where not giving you the attention you so claim to need, you come to reddit to show off your mental instability?

---
I once had a direct wormhole static to the glorious 37S-KO system, home of the glorious Nation (and sole system I know with a description like regions)
---
But I have too many assets in that wormhole
---
How do I move it out to the glorious Stain region
---
Without a damn LowSec Gate 
---
It's a mess, just like the imperium itself.
---
I always sell my LP stuff to Jita buy orders. Please keep Jita prices according to the decree and we can already set a deal.
---
Oh ok. Well I don't get the point of it then. Surely if it's just for the set-up process it's better to do it in a regular anom that has beefier rats in a cloaky ship that can get past them. Although I guess if you're not intending on keeping it past downtime you can sit on it and not warp or log off, just seems a lot of set-up to troll for such a short time.
---
what is imperium news?
---
i guess its hard to police the games Rules when the Leader of said Alliance constantly sidesteps Bans for RMT on a regular basis and this is deemed acceptable behaviour within their leadership
---
&gt;Can't remember the last time I had one of those.
---
Then you really want to get out more. We get fights all the time like [this](https://zkillboard.com/related/31001773/201903172200/), or [this](https://zkillboard.com/related/31001470/201903170200/), or [this](https://zkillboard.com/related/31000511/201903291800/), or [this](https://zkillboard.com/related/31001993/201903242300/), or [this](https://zkillboard.com/related/31002005/201903201600/), or [this](https://zkillboard.com/related/31002543/201903192000/)... I could go on. If you're not getting fights ask yourself what you're doing wrong.
---
&gt; Last time I remember chain mass fucking me was moving a sleip fleet through a c1. 
---
Again, I've been in several fights myself (a few of them *recently*) where the hole has either crit or closed from mass passing through it and my corpies definitely get into more fights that I do. Perhaps if you were more active and actually out scouting instead of ship spinning and complaining that no one undocks for you....

I’m currently living in a C1 wormhole with a nullsec static. Since we are quite a bit inside, the anomalies generally don’t have the time to accumulate and are run as soon as someone spot them (and to be honest C1 anomalies aren’t that good). I can currently run any of them with a four LSE Gila (the same I use for T3 Abyssal site), but I have a question : is there any ship in the medium size range that can do either C2 or C3 anomalies solo, please ?
---
Another question, can someone please give me a fit to safely run T4 Abyssal sites ? Since dying there mean being locked out of my wormhole until I find a good highsec route, I’d like to be sure not to die running them (I don’t even know if I’d be able to survive that infamous Starving Leshak spawn)...
---
Or you know they could just give 50k SP on the live server for participating in a test.

&gt;If you're not getting fights ask yourself what you're doing wrong.
---
Dealing with corps that won't fight us. I like epicentre, your cyclone fleet is pretty cool. 
---
Doesn't mean corps want to fight hard knocks. Usually our kills are out the ns, or from finding people like indigo who undock a fuck-off cap blob in a pulsar. I don't remember shooting you in a long time. 
---
&gt;Perhaps if you were more active and actually out scouting instead of ship spinning and complaining that no one undocks for you
---
Scouting is great when you want to find a connection 10j deep, tackle it with a saber alt, and then find out the connection was rolled ages ago because you're 10 jumps deep. Short chains are good. 
---
As for ship spinning, yeah I'm doing that right now. I did 20 hours of hole control for an eviction that wasn't even ours over 2 days. I remember doing an eviction with your boys. I did roughly 8 hours of hole control per day for that, because nobody in your corp would step up. But hey, maybe you guys will actively do hole control now.  
---
Karma fleet is recruiting.
---
TDF accepts pretty much every T1 armor BS. Plus they are more new player friendly becuase they make ISK faster and get them into better ships. Two years ago I joined them with an Apoc, after 3 days I was in a faction and officer fit nightmare.
---
As someone being waterboarded hard a few months ago in a no-prop-Rattle and a Dread, i know how this can hurt. Took us close to 4 hrs to make 2 jumps, fight and make 2 jumps back ... phew ....

Being a super duper detective *(Able to hit the 'Related' Button)* I have discovered that the character in question was one of the First **Ferox** to die. Reshipped twice into 2 **Griffins**, then whith Ferrox still on field Reshipped into a Harbinger, possibly his only other BC.

Seems like damn dedication to the cause for me, showed up in all the right ships until he lost them *all* pouring in to save a friendly dread.

this does usually hold true, however they did have fax reps on the field.

Your flair says *Initiative* so I assumed K-spacer... I think to an extent HK is outgrowing (or has outgrown) WH space. Actually, is that flair meant to be some sort of meme given recent history?

Yup. And rage rolling holes is even better...  I guess you guys have a second static now... but rolling with sub caps must be a bit different.
---
&gt; I don't remember shooting you in a long time.

Tis is true. Bob has not seen fit to put us in the same chain for a while iirc. Look forward to rolling into you guys sometime soon.

That would bring ten times as many people to mass tests, so no, I think the current rewards seems just about right and CCP would surely change it if they were unhappy with the number of participants in mass tests.
---
He said, while he spends all day looking for fights in FW. Only to have the first ship he "tackled" warp away. When he finally catches someone, he alone can not kill the menace so he has to call his pals to complete his task....shut up stupid.

&gt;  ten times as many people to mass tests

I think whole reason of mass test is to get as many users as you can

Nice repost mate
---
Hi all. A couple questions:
---
1.I'm very new, about 3 days in, I've just been mining for some income. I want to do some ratting but can't find a simple guide on how to do it or how to fit my ship decently. All videos are 50 odd minutes long and between work and responsibilities I don't have the time to watch them. Could anyone provide some basic info or links where I can do some quick reading? Once I get the jist I'll figure the rest out.
---
2. Just bought a condor running a few rocket launchers but I'm still having trouble doing even the first agency mission for security. I bought a shield thing, medium (can't remember the name off the top of my head and not at home), but only have the power to run my ship for 21 seconds or something? How is it I increase the power for my ship/make it possible to run this module 
---
Thanks 
---
Lasers to save on ammo!
---
RIP me logging after the fleet had left. I was wondering why there were only 70 krabs in Theta. 
---
They have plenty enough people participating in test. Rewarding TQ SP is retarded.

Its like a days worth of training a month, not exactly gamebreaking.

I wouldnt mind if the free and sovereign citizens of England voted to join the Russian Federation as the Angliyskaya oblast.

&gt; Its like a days worth of training a month, not exactly gamebreaking.
---
Still retarded and egoistic of you.

Why? I got three implants from drops last week, I'm all in favor of making it crazy expensive after the switch over :-)
---
Most of the ones i've seen are around 17:00 UK/EU time.

TL:DR version:  
---
1.  Guy joins corp and alliance.  
---
2.  Guy says he can FC.  
---
3.  Guy takes out 1-2 fleets in 3 years.  
---
4.  Guy is passive-aggressive and criticizes anyone that comes up with fits, doctrines or wants to take out small fleets.  
---
5.  Guy still does not FC.  
---
6.  Guy goes AFK for real life.  Gone for more than a year, except for the rare occasion.  
---
7.  Guy comes back and flips structures to alt corp and swipes corp containers.  
---
8.  Guy steals 40b or so in moon go, 12-14b in p1 or something like 30-35 freighter loads (mine), a Vegas bio suit, a handful of freighters and hole rolling battleships and random other items worth 5-10b.  Total net worth around 60-70b.  
---
9.  Guy gets cold feet and tries to ransom citadels, resulting in the ACL being open and me being able to extricate 400b in assets to another station.  
---
10.  Guy inflicts losses on a small scale to a bunch of old friends because angry about something.  
---
11.  Structures were nuked by alliance and replaced inside of a week.  
---
12.  Guy comes back every 30 days to send am email to see if we miss him, are angry with him or something.  
---
13.  Guy obviously did too many drugs and thinks the world is out to get him.  
---
###Punchline: I thought the guy was a waste of space and a ticking time bomb. The cost of assets lost is considered an acceptable price to pay to be rid of him.
---
 Very  nice.
---
Background reminds shattered wormhole system.  Very well done! 
---
This is absolutely lovely— you not only captured the ship perfectly, but its style and mood as well. Looking forward to seeing more of your work in the future!
---
I am saying that they always have people yo fill fleet, because they make so much money that they  have people with 4 alts. Even with only 30 real people in a 40 man fleet they make more ISK then WTM.
---
The only real use is either being a slightly annoying pest or forcing a fight on a favourable grid. If you wanted to use it to have a risk-free ESS you'd just do it in a combat sig at the edge of the grid, and bookmark a spot on the nextdoor grid so you can burn back to it in just a few minutes. This isn't an exploit though.
---
Well, they are the baby corp to PL, so it only makes sense that they have the same views on battle reports.
---
Coolio! Still seems pointless to me, but at least the how makes sense. :) Thanks for taking the time to dumb it down for me.

Thanks!!

I think going solo would indeed be extremely difficult - however, getting some sort of a kibutz going with some fellow players may have some educational purposes.  It will teach the actual time cost of things we take for granted (like t2 equipment) and will offer a glimpse into the past at the beginning of eve when all the things had to be painfully self-sourced.   
---
A few friends and myself tried to start an alliance based on a few tenets like these (i linked it somewhere in this thread) - it was supposed to be faction based and we would trade things only within the alliance (4 corporation of 4 factions)   
---
Why it didn't work:  
---
* If you do something else on the side you won't have time, at least at start it's very inefficient 
---
* We wanted to revive hisec pockets - like Molden Heath. With the addition of the NPC mining fleets you will find no fucking asteroid fields anywhere near their locations. This fucked "boostrapping" up hard. 
---
* It's hard to find people with the necessary grit to go through this ordeal - and sometimes it's hard to find it within yourself as well - because you just know how easy you would've had it if you just spent some isk on the market and bought a t2 fit. 
---
* PVP is nearly impossible since you will most likely be outgunned and you will never fly a t2 equipment for fear of losing it. Hell, even losing ships to NPCs would be heartbreaking. 
---
What we could've done to make it work (speculation) 
---
* Get some money in to get it started (like by corp bpos, etc) 
---
* Recruit more like-minded people and keep the recruitment process going as there will be churn 
---
* maybe start in proper hisec (although bleah) 
---
I think it's a very romantic idea, sounds very adventurous - but when confronted with the actual reality, like most ideas of this kind, it kinda falters. That being said, if you want to start this type of group - I will throw in an alt :) 
---
That is absolutely superb, Thank you for sharing.
---
Must have missed most of the chart then, I’m on mobile. Only saw a single data column
---
Outstanding!
---
In legend, it's where the Caldari State was born, if you take the semi-canonical works of Herko Khergans as gospel. Which I know I do..
---
Train up capacitor skills and shield skills, those will help with a ship lasting longer.
---
&gt;Punchline: I thought the guy was a waste of space and a ticking time bomb. The cost of assets lost is considered an acceptable price to pay to be rid of him.

And you still had him as a director, sure thing bro.

This is a wonderful video. Thank you.

I'll was going to scan them in for this but i think i may need a new scanner, my phone seems to take better pictures!
---
Some people tried this as a corp years ago [Clicky](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/220lcx/creating_a_new_empire_it_is_happening/)
---
It surely is an awful lot of work and you might get frustrated quickly if your newly build ship is blown up in seconds.
---
But getting a small corp going for this and moving it to a low-class WH might be fun. (Hoping for FOBs soonish)
---
It's worse than a vni but very rare so to me prov around 20 30 b 
---
Have you tried Google PhotoScan? It's meant for preserving old photos, but you basically take a picture of each corner (it guides you through the process) and works really well on glossy photos when it stitches everything together, removing the glare. Not sure how it would work on a watercolor or if the resolution of your phone's camera will do it justice, but maybe worth a shot?
---
Thanks, I'll look into it :)
---
Indentured Servant - Improved (High Grade)
---
Why not? If I'm not mistaken(which I may very well be, I haven't even done their epic quest or what ever it is.) the sisters seem dedicated to exploration and mapping and the lost technology of the eve gate(the lore in this game is a really undersold point by the way, it's been a fun read so far.). This often puts them in dangerous situations, over the years why wouldn't they develop a destroyer to protect them from inherent dangers?
---
There is also a relatively decent chance that I am completely wrong and have no idea what I'm talking about. 
---
i wish i was a millionare and had a gallery so i could go and collect all the art you see on this subreddit for public display in a gallery 
---
The machariel is good for killing everything in a mission but one of the things that makes it good for blitzing is the warp speed bonus. If you only want to kill everything in a mission and want a cheaper ship a mealstrom might be better for you.
---
It sort of depends where you are doing missions though. Running missions in minmitar space will be good in minmitar ships due to the resists and the most common pirate enemy you will be facing.
---
A raven could also be ok if you have any missile skills
---
"You" as the corp then, poiny still stands
---
Your point is that my personal opinion of this fellow isn't what I stated?
---
If you want to casually hang out and kill everyone and everything, I recommend a Marauder =)
---
I like to warp in my Paladin and just start shooting. No need to move around or anything, just load Multi or Scorch depending where they're at. If things start to get heated when you've "accidentally" aggro'd everything on the field at once, you just Siege up and watch as the rats struggle to get you below 99% before another rep cycle comes along.
---
Nice
---
Not pictured: the seven other Stratioses cloaked behind it.
---
&gt; leaving plenty of room for amulets + armor pumps  
---
ftfy
---
I have not tried that and I will look at it now! thanks
---
Ah the 'ol, adapt to broken mechanics argument rather than fix the broken mechanics to create a pathway for new players to learn, and experience PvP in a setting they can be competitive in early.
---
Must be why I farm LP now by orbiting plexes and warping off when other people show up. :/ I adapted to the broken mechanics.
---
I agree with marauder, I use a golem, but same thing, takes longer, but you can salvage and muck about without much worry
---
On #2:  Yeah, locations off a public social media account that he liked to show off.  When there's a public social media post with obvious Texas locations in it, you can pretty much assume. "Hey, that's Texas."
---
Fit Tank , capstable with damage onto every battleship hull and I can run level 4 missions .. 
---
But people blitz them to be efficient, u can do most missions in t2 frigs aswell just takes longer 
---
Beautiful ! Nice work once again !
---
That looks great!
---
RIP Dead Coalition SRP
---
You could say the sky is blue and u/redalert447 will find a reason to bitch at you, it's all in the ticker.
---
Eh, some of us didn't get the same vibe from him.  I really don't think this was a long con, that's just a saving face bit, self attention seeking.
---
Something changed near the end of that, and frankly some of us were more worried about making sure he was OK then protecting space pixels.
---
This makes two years in a row that Fozies April fools Day Joke was dropping a real set of devblogs on April fools. 
---
You got current armor Slaves? They will remain armor, just the name changes. 
---
Wow congrats ! Thats an Amazing job :)
---
There was a guy named "Huck Forde" that got accepted into horde, awoxed a bunch of people, and then got let back into another horde corp.
---
Makes you think.
---
Yes but in the future those same 3 drops would be the new shield slaves.
---
On field best dps will probably be Rattlesnake.
---
I'm just imagining this thing lowering down out of the clouds to some sick or attached colony with a bunch of SOE med techs and crazy cool humanitarian aid stuff just unloading like, as soon as the landing gear just kiss the ground.
---
Great work
---
Yes, that's the point.
---
If you want then to organise measures, you just filter based on the tags that you have in each line.
---
Some really nice work. I especially love the Tempest. Thanks for sharing these. 
---
but eve's economy was meant to conform to one economical ideology.
---
like wtf...
---
i never had problems with roaming big alliances space until faxes and fighter mechanic changes.
---
go figure.
---
That is amazing, would 100% buy that and have on my wall. Like said before in here it just captures the ship and the mood perfectly.
---
Is that numeric? If yes, how much for a print, if not, how much for the original
---
yes i'm running in minmatar space, so yes i'm facing angel cartel and guristas for most of the time.
---
but i really cant find a good fit for maelstrom or tempest, it's really hard to find... or maybe i don't know where to search :|
---
But does this mean Tek will try to delete the local channel too. #MePoo
---
Actually, it is owned space, by the Empire factions, and those who enlist in FW are fighting for them.
---
for a lower class WH I would say about 2b, 1,5b covers an Astrahus + a standard fit for defense and the remaining 500m can be dropped into very barebones ships to clear all content available (Mining, Sites, Exploration, Gas. +ships to roll your wormholes with). Doesn't take too long to pay all that back and from there you can just grow the arsenal adding/replacing ships.
---
For us, we just spent a week or so scouting out suitable WHs and once we found a suitable one that was also empty we sat a scanning alt there checking connections each day until we got a decent hisec connection. Hauled everything in with 2 DST's and that was that.
---
Like someone else also pointed out in this thread, if you wish to truly become a PITA to evict, build one or two capitals in the hole if it's a lower class.
---
I fucking wish
---
1 - you need to look into what sort of NPC you're fighting against (serpentis, guristas mordus etc...) Look into this page https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/NPC_damage_types
---
Then fit your ship to have resists to the damage the NPC's deal (you have a shield condor, so you'll need to plug shield resist holes of either EM, Thermal, Kinetic or Explosive, again, that depends on the NPC you're fighting) and you'll also need to be dealing damage that will aim for their resist holes (every NPC has different resist holes likewise) and because you're using rockets, they can deal which ever damage type you need - Mjolnir for EM dmg, Inferno for Thermal, Nova for Everything and Scourge for Kinetic. That will improve your survivability and the time it take for you to finish the mission. As for the missions themselves, it's been a long time since I've done them, so I can't give more advices except to read closely what the mission requires you to do.
---
2 - so you're using a medium shield booster, which regenerates your shields by using capacitor. So you can either also fit a Cap booster in your mid slot (and load it with cap booster charges) which gives you more cap or you can use a Medium Ancillary Shield Booster (which uses cap booster charges to regenerate the shields. But just don't let it run without boosters loaded into it (basically a MASB can have 9 "Cap boosters 50" so you have 9 reps until you need to stop the module and let it reload, which takes 1min). You can also try to use a small or medium Cap battery to increase the capacitor capacity.
---
except all the other communities aren't as active as WTM.  
---
i find it hard to be cap stable and active tank at the same time.
---
do you have any suggestion?
---
Numeric? Its painted on paper, send me a pm if serious
---
It doesn't say anything in the OP. Nikolai was there first hand, he is just correcting the record.
---
You need to write him an EVE Mail in which you reference a porn star, a blind deaf American woman, a music icon, and close with a bible reference about two men wrestling while naked.
---
If it's any consolation, you're smarter than I am for not having done so. 
---
Everyone seems to be ignoring the Minmatar bit. 
---
Tempest: Not amazing but still a solid choice. 
---
Typhoon: Really underated, the missile application bonus makes using Cruises and torps pretty good and its got plenty of slots and good speed if you wanna burn around and use torps.
---
Maelstrom: Sheild boost bonus is great but slow as all hell and moving around is a pain. 
---
Mach: Easily the best but you really want Gallente battleship trained as well. 
---
Its good for just running them as well as blitzing so its not just a blitz boat. 
---
As for specific fits you dont want to use that fit really, especially as a relatively new character. 
---
Rule of thumb is you want 1000dps combined tank and gank. 
---
So just play around with fits in Pyfa with your skills. 
---
[Already posted 5 hours ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b8ghgd/sisileaks_looks_like_sanshas_nation_could_be_the/) , which was in itself a repost.

Sure. That didn't seem to be what he was saying, but i might be mistaken.
---
Come to Delve and join the largest group in the game who support all styles of gameplay. We have various groups that do all manner of different things within our alliance and you can join different groups depending on what interests you. As for which Corp to join specifically, I recommend Karmafleet which has a robust player support program and is well organized. If you have questions, PM me. I hold some sway in Delve.
---
Good to know we don't need to bother showing up.
---
If you don't care about efficiency that's fine. Just fly what you like.
---
You can do lvl 4 missions in probably any BS. And some Cruisers with speed/sig tank.
---
2nd time's the charm(?)
---
Yes until everyone says that and they don't have enough people to test and we get half tested fixes on TQ.
---
Another beautiful SoE ship art! I absolutely adore their ship designs and I love your rendition of the Stratios.
---
Scanned through new real quick and didn't see it, my bad.
---
Fabulous! Great artwork, now do an Orca.
---
Machariel is the best for what you are looking for aswell, but if you want to use something slightly different you can get a Maelstorm.
---
It's not gatekeeping to say that if you aren't active in a community your speculation about groups and motives may not be the most accurate. 
---
I don't think HK/Lazers are doing gods work by any means, but there is an undeniable difference between evicting groups that give fights, and those that just dock up. 
---
Finally, I don't think anyone here is really getting mad at or condemning this eviction, we are just calling a spade a spade. Waiting till the owner is out, then burning all his shit while he is away isn't exactly engaging content. INHE had their shot and they took it, fair play to them. People just don't appreciate the OP painting it like some hard fought battle where Stranger ended up simply standing down, because that isn't what happened.
---
It doesn't need to be cap stable imo. It just has to tank sufficient dps for the site at hand.
---
That's more so the case with shield than with armor.
---
I'd recommend a xl shield booster, 1 or 2 race specific hardeners and maybe a boost amplifier.
---
Really depends on slot layouts and ship boni.
---
3rd actually. This was posted a few weeks ago as well where it got upvoted pretty high.
---
As long as they pay taxes, I’m sure the horde directorate don’t care who flies the flag.

Somewhat off topic but still related: be prepared to read a lot if you want to play properly

Forgive me Father for I am Jaguar pilot.
---
I haven't bothered to reply to any of the bi-weekly "Hey look at me" posts since the incident, but hey, I'm procrastinating, so why not.
---
We all know this wasn't a long con, that's just post-rationalization.  There was a drastic shift in personality about the time you needed your 'real life break'.  Yeah, some of us poked mutual friends to make sure you were all right and to see if you'd needed anything, because that's the sort of thing some of us do.
---
In the end, all said and done, a few shitty choices were made, and well, I think most of us were more disappointed then anything else.  
---
Internet pixels are removed.
---
The industrial machine churns
---
Structures get replaced
---
We move on.  
---
This is EvE, it was an inconvenience for certain but  you've known for years that we have the infrastructure in place to handle even a rogue director in STK-S.  It's not like this is the first time, probably won't be the last.  
---
Then the routine "Hey look at me, look what I have done, you should feel bad about it" eve mails, posts, and what not started, and the disappointment faded, and it turned into a bit of a 'look at this crap' sort of joke.  
---
Really, I guess most of us don't really care anymore? 
---
You burned trust which is the only currency that really matters.  
---
In the end, I hope you get whatever you were going through sorted?  If not, oh well.  
---
As an aside, if you don't want people knowing where you are, don't publicly post your location to a previously shared, public, social media account, you used to brag about things maybe?  If it has a states landmarks in it, or a state highway signs in it, it's a good bet it's probably taken in that state.
---
I can't recommend joining GoonSwarm Federation enough for many reasons, 1. Most of them have experience and are willing to teach new people, 2. They are living in the safest space where you can build your self without the fear of being evicted (Only God can evict Goons now!), 3. They have many fun fleets and activities which you can participate in. You can join Karmafleet which is part of Goonswarm.
---
That is my recommendation and iam not even part of Goonswarm anymore!
---
Hope that helps you!

That was really some really impressive fighting. Also really in love with the music choices &lt;3

* Train up to an expedition frigate. 
---
* Train up gas cloud harvesting 
---
* Train expedition frigate to 4 
---
* Train Gas cloud harvesting to 5 to get the t2 harvesters  
---
* Buy a Prospect, fit it with covops cloak, t2 gas harvester, core probe launcher, mwd, survey scanner and 4 Warp core stabilizers. 
---
* Explore wormholes/lowsec/nullsec, scan for gas sites, check the internet for gas prices
---
* Get the gas, import the ingredients to a hisec refinery and make fullerenes/boosters out of them or just sell the gas raw 
---
* Profit 
---
This is the only way for the solo miner. 
---
for starters, until you get the prospect, use a venture - t1 gas harvesters and a probe launcher. Trip into wormholes, mine the good gas, make money. 
---
Don't be fucking salty when you die, it's just what it is. From the ganker's perspective you can be a)bait, b)spy, c)freeloader, d) competition, even if you are a 1 day old char.

fuck outta I here, it felt rude but given your behaviour I guess it wasnt out of line...
---
&gt; They have plenty enough people participating in test.
---
Total window licker.
---
I'm completely fine with that I'm just struggling to find somewhere that can give me a decent answer. I found a suggested fit for my ship on the wiki but it was a bit outdated as I couldn't find some of the items it mentioned
---
yeah the changed their name from Clusterfuck Coalition when they wanted to attract sponsors for their multidollar media empire.
---
Coolest looking line of faction ships if you ask me, would be nice to see more Sisters ship classes, but maybe that would be against there philosophy.
---
they did!
---
there is no way to absolve you of this sin. your shame will never disappear, you will bear the mark of Jaguar Pilot for all of eternity
---
good video though, excellent splitting which led to some great frags!
---
You don't want to shoot blue by accident! 
---
Sorry for the late response, but I recommend looking up WarpToMe incursions - they will have newbie fits listed for T1 Amarr battleships, but the "goal" for incursion laser Battleships is the Nightmare, the Sansha BS. It's shield tanking so you may need some skills there, but it'll be cheaper than going for a machariel.
---
&gt;Another question, can someone please give me a fit to safely run T4 Abyssal sites ?
---
There is no such thing. You always can die.
---
&gt;  And some Cruisers with speed/sig tank.
---
VNI worked ok on some missions... But in some missions, you had to reanchor a few times to get to the rats, or leave grid to repair when the dps spiked. 
---
Tell that to NC who somehow fed Muninns to RHML Rattlesnakes lmao
---
Nice Geo!
---
Dude sounds like he got on some meds in real life and his brain took a 180 lol
---
Some of you guys are alright. Don't go to Tampa tomorrow.
---
Why?
---
Well i mean, most of NC/PL have below average IQ and a superiority complex that resonates from previous victories against people that cant fight. So when they meet a force of equal size they melt
---
You did not learn how to play eve.  Real eve players drop a cyno and boom spaceships.

Yes. Loosing a couple of VNIs to blinged Lokis taught me a thing too.

Drone and missile will always be the best option for PVE. Raven/phoon/geddon/domi and the best one Rattlesnake.
---
loads of resist, cap recharge and amplified large shield booster will allow you to perma run it, and almost afk the missions

I used one of the -20% velocity reducing rigs for my missiles, but you could use the -20% explosive reduction ones as well.
---
Or as others have said more cap stability, the 7 nuet cruisers spawns give me the creeps in my Cerb. 
---
I would agree with you but after annihilating that rattlesnake we failed to tackle a stabber who jumped gates with us, humbling and brought us back to reality that we really do suck at this game. 
---
except they didn't paint it as that...
---
that's what's so revolting about this spin. inhe says "and here was cool limited issue shit we wanted to kill so we did" and everyone goes "why did you evict an active pvp group when they were out and then pretend it was a good fight" 
---
definition of strawman 
---
I was  more thinking of the Tengu of old. Admittedly i don't know whether that's still viable.
---
Thats a lot of words for a handful of industry structures and a super kill.

man if you think the hk/hawks nutrider brigade is above political bullshit then have I got a surprise for you 
---
Sounds retarded so someone in eve is probably doing it.

---
Only officer? Not abysmal maxed officer's ?
---
Not to mention that might be the worst use of 3 awox toons I've ever seen.  5 smartbomb cycles taking our logi to half shields and like 20 seconds of webbing the logi anchor.  The burst jams could have been done more effectively by ceptors.
---
Says himself
---
I couldn't believe you killed that kiki, especially after seeing its fit. Good job at being successful ramboi.

&gt; Typhoon: Really underated, the missile application bonus makes using Cruises and torps pretty good and its got plenty of slots and good speed if you wanna burn around and use torps.

---
wow very cool
---
Wow, original content right there
---
God, someone just got shit on so hard. 
---
one could only wish....
---
using chat with icons turned on and non compact member list
---
actually unwatchable
---
Zero experience with Minmatar fits, so no help on that, but get the same issue as an active tank doing primarily full-clear L4s. 
---
First thing is to give up on 'cap stable' as that'll need probably a bunch more SP (or in some fits is just impossible), but getting it to a reasonable time is good: cap drain in 20mins is fine, 2mins is less so. Then look for implants - many can be got for LP if you're shy the isk - like [Inherent Implants 'Squire' Capacitor Management EM-805](http://www.ellatha.com/eve/LPSearch/Inherent-Implants-%2527Squire%2527-Capacitor-Management-EM-805/) (that one gives you more cap capacity, there's others to increase recharge rate and so forth) and make sure you have all your cap skills maxed out. As you get better skills, and more experience with the individual missions, you'll get them cleared faster, and thus your cap needs go down (who cares if you only have 20mins cap if you can clear the site in 15?).
---
Once you've got cap as pumped as possible, then just don't be scared to bounce off to station halfway through, dock &amp; undock, and get back in. When I started doing L4s (with barely the skills to fly a BS), I struggled through most of the ones I got with maybe one flee per site, but that was because I got lucky with easier missions...then I got [Angel Extraveganza](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Angel_Extravaganza_(Level_4)) and fuck me was it painful! So be aware that whether your cap will stretch to the full site will vary from mission to mission, and just keep an eye on that cap and be ready to run out and recharge when needed. You could fit a cap booster, but to be honest it's a slot that could be used by better things, and you'd probably spend more time (and isk) refuelling your cap booster charge supply than just bouncing to station and back now and then. 
---
&gt; Then dont decide to live in a warzone.
---
&gt; And i dont see many silly rules imposed on you.
---
I could argue that FW guys suck it in in defending their now inaccessible citadel if they were made unavailable to those in the opposing faction. Everyone risks when dropping a structure in lowsec but you'd like to punish people who have no dog in the fight. 
---
It's better that those involved in losing access when losing a system are the ones inconvenienced.  Maybe they'll fight harder for that system after losing a fort or two.
---
If they’re not on grid then just align and recall drones. Those navy drones are expensive as shit
---
john hartley one time burned a horde toon to try and fleet warp a bridge rag off a raitaru
---
he was awake and cancelled warp, and the ~20 feroxes who didn't killed his cyno ares before anything could jump in
---
v good use of an awox toon
---
He has 6m SP, he ain't going to be flying a marauder.  He needs a T1 Minmatar BS fit. Best choice might be the poor man's rattlesnake aka the Typhoon. Fit it with MJD, cruise missiles, and sentry drones etc. But you need good missile and drone skills, which are not traditional Minmatar weapon systems. Next maybe the Tempest. 
---
Nice, love that gila [https://www.instagram.com/p/Bog1fdQD9ov/](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bog1fdQD9ov/)
---
dope music, good fights
---
I stand corrected, they are all sick, keep it up!
---
&gt;Frequently we have been unable to kill t1 battleships reliably before reps hit even with 100+ eagles.
---
that... doesn't sound right
---
&gt;you have to pull range and use spike to get that sig tank working nicely vs battleship guns.
---
??????
---
^ this. Turn off your prop mod, align to your warp out, recall drones, and spam your d-scan. And hope it's not a cloaky lol
---
And turn off AB, that damn thing prevents warp better than scramming, that got me killed too. :)
---
If I found a rattlesnake running sites in my C3, how would I take him out bearing in mind the rats and insane tankability of the bling fit BS. I am living there solo so don't have the option of pinging for support. Is there a ship I could fit to try and ruin his fun?
---
Thanks
---
Yeah, its one of my favorites as well, was given away to a friend and co-ceo of our corp for being exceptionally helpful
---
Well depends which ship u want to use , Machariel, tempest typhoon or maelstrom?
---
Just one word "Great"!

---
They should have used more defensive bubbles when they lost their anti-bomber ships.  
---
Really nice video! I knew jaguars were strong, but damn - this was impressive to see! Surprised you got that first kiki
---
He was making fun of the capital-heavy meta right now, where everyone's response to any problem is to drop one or more carriers
---
So we have a mega ISK faucet from ratting afk in carriers etc and someone thought it was a good idea to have structure that boosts this ISK and furthermore still thinks it’s a good idea to keep it as an option in game?
---
yeah boy thats the right formula. die -&gt; learn from mistake -&gt; go die again. 
---
Ah cool, I do have some shield skills but otherwise I should be good. Thanks for the info. 
---
Impressive!
---
+1
---
If he's active fit (which he probably is) getting a dualrep geddon/bhaal will most likely take him down. Worst case you neut him dry and run away. 
---
Or just do something that will let plex continue to rise in price at a rather drastic rate while bringing ISK faucets to reasonable levels and at the same time give better deals on actual subscriptions. 
---
This would bring everything down to reasonable levels. Sure it would take a while until plex stockpiles are brought down considerably, but it would balance itself and be vastly improved over what it is now.
---
Since Rubicon in 2014. Up to 5% better bounties and LP as well.

/r/eve users are usually a few weeks behind on memes
---
They only ban bots on the occasional weekend and it's just Tuesday...
---
Meanwhile, can I interest you in this Ibis police SKIN?
---
And if it's passive you'd need at least 1k dps to break it and some fit can tank up to 2k dps.
---
Also Scramble him so he does mdj out
---
&gt; We had information on the strength of the defense forces and expected to get a good fight with using capital ships. However, the defenders lurked, clearly counting on the reinforcement of their allies. We are faced with a similar tactic when evicting another team - BTLH 
---
IIRC they've definitely said they want to make a soe fax. It fits their lore well. 
---
yea if he's passive fit just neut and walk away :) 
---
Thank you nullsec for taking all the retards.  Sincerely yours wh space BTW

not sure why everyone on here bandwagoning snuffed when they're just gonna drop on u next week lmao.

How Fort has lost in ER?

How many Forts has Unspoken Alliance lost in ER?

Is it just Goons Spinning thing to face face like always?

Congrats for saving a Fort.

I guess the 16+ downvotes meant I really touched a nerve. Sorry about that. Although you'd think having half a dozen friendly alliances with different timezones would allow goons n' pets to take the spire weeks ago. Can you take it already so we can remove your ihubs?
---
i like how you edited to include low
---
SO... You think someone is stalking you in real life and instead of going to CCP or even better... The police... You decide to steal from your accused stalkers and then proceed to make a reddit post about it?
---
🤔 
---
Might be wrong, but I think what was going wrong with the bomb runs is sometimes the bombs were not coordinated and thus were overlapping too much and fraticiding each other. If I remember the numbers right, 6 bombs will survive each other but 7 won't. Am I right?
---
When was last time Rote Kapelle was relevant In EvE?
---
Stop been so salty

thanks, brothurr

Why is that the meta?

Not even once actually

Intelligent play, cool fights, interesting music. Well done, thanks for sharing.
---
shield slaves will come from the mission runners in stain, not from test in eso
---
Because it's cheaper and safer than it should be, and if you're in a region where people just wanna krab in peace it's a good way to squash content quickly and get back to Netflix and krab.
---
How do you field a stationary shield battleship fleet and not have an anti-bomber plan?  Like the only thing that can kill rattlesnakes is bombers
---
Ok im sure this could be fun for exactly 2 minutes, untill ppl figured out how to beat it and then its just safer mining?
---
CCP finally makes a gate to stain.  Players applaud.
---
CCP surrounds both ends of the gate with permanent ESS structures.
---
Or, you simply open a site and have progressively greater and greater waves of trig stuff come attack you. At some point you have to leave. Trig ships drop trig stuff naturally.
---
A few smart bombs would have helped for sure. I dunno...I was in the skirting about eagle fleet 
---
This opens up so much more room for weekly activities...
---
Would prefere if they would first fix "ressource wars" and make them actually worth running. "Combat mining" is a very niche gameplay, no need to introduce an abyssal version.
---
the only one that matters is you
---
oh thanks, i checked their website and last update was bit old
---
Not sure why you are asking me as I was only commenting on Jay's post about shooting wrecks but ill try to help answer your question. I don't know how many Forts have been lost or saved in total (if an UA guys sees this post and can answer that would be sweet), as for how bad Pamfam is loosing it depends on how you measure it. Based on the Imperium objective to take away the rental income of NC in the spire regions, we can definitely see that the region is being hotly contested based on all the timers for IHUBS/TCU (49 total at the time of this writing) but I believe it is too early to definitively say. I think in a week or two we will have more data to show what was lost and saved overall to make a better conclusion of the current state of things. We need to see how many renters have left, what the approximate loss of income is, and total damage infrastructure wise was done to the spire region. Hope this helped.       
---
Krab?
---
Only after the imperium swear allegiance to our shield overlords and discard armor supers.
---
Bombers Bar was my introduction to Null way back when. I know there's some mixed feelings, but way back when, Templeman N was a legend.
---
No missions.
---
And no mining.
---
And no trading@!
---
Playing eve as a space hobo.  By looting wrecks and salvaging.
---
Here, take my upvote! Well done mate
---
Easy gotem
---
I run a similar fleet for the Brave standing fleet. Does yours require a CPU rig?
---
Pve
---
Or just have already trig sites drop minimg lasers and strippers that get better over time see whar i did there :)
---
If its in the same way that Abyssal sites are "safer ratting" then I would consider that a win.
---
Finally Boat does something right ;-0
---
Stealth bomber doesn't have to wait. I have a special purifier just for people that do that. No guns, scram, web, ab, 10,000 ehp. It holds you down til my proteus lands ;)
---
Didn't killah say back in 2016 they would never use rattles again after losing some battles? Why is he or nc./pl using it again. It is plain shit vs subcaps supported with bombers. They ate shit back in 2016 and are eating shit now.
---
wow how did you get so good? I can't even draw clothes
---
3rd for the marauder. I use a Kronos though.
---
The tank is a huge step up from any BS (aside of maybe the Hyperion), and the bonuses to bastion mean you can hit things pretty far out with a single fraction tracking computer.
---
Before the Kronos I used a Vindicator. The tank was good enough with mission specific hardners and a dead space armor rep. I never seriously considered shield tanking it, but I think that's actually the way the majority of people fit it for PvE. 
---
1,000dps easy with enough tank to get through anything except maybe the bonus room in Extravaganza and that one where rats start spawning as soon as you accept the mission. I lost my first battleship (a megethron) to that mission. I rage quit for almost a week. 
---
dude, telling us that x and did y doesn't make it true per se. but let's say it's true; what does it make CVA traitors?
---
if you pushed away your grudge for a second and think about it, you'd agree that you can't defend everything during an invasion. in fact many cva strucs got removed w/o getting defended; should cva members cry forever because of this? geez.
---
and as a fleet member i didn't see rounon try to have a last battle. i only saw that he decided that yulai should pussy out and actually helped the invaders to get a hand on some useful structures to ease their logistics. maybe these structures weren't of any use; but the symbolic message he delivered as an alliance leader, head of a former coalition member and former FC is quite clear, isn't it?
---
if people wanna leave because they can't stand eq, that's fine. but remembering to leave only when the fight isn't in our favor is just plain low.
---
Basically what you should avoid 😛
---
The tank is a huge step up from any BS (aside of maybe the Hyperion), and the bonuses to bastion mean you can hit things pretty far out with a single fraction tracking computer and Null.

---
Man just think all this could of been avoided if they just paid Peleus like he asked.
---
Respect. A purifier with 10k ehp is amazing lol
---
I don’t think your attitude and tone is going to do you any favors
---
Means they warped before you could finish locking 
---
You are not the only one to regret this april joke.
---
It needs obvious adjustements, but it can be a decent addition to the game as it add a new gameplay, the corpse harvesters. Maybe it can even be linked to some internal lores, like the Blood Raiders NPC faction. Grant them some corpses to get more standings or whatever.
---
i'm pretty sure you get a different message for that. "you couldn't lock ____ because his ship is in warp". this guy slowboated 12km away from me while being unlockable.
---
no
---
fuckin hate them
---
Was ur locking range to short. Were u in a shuttle?
---
Beautiful!
---
*laughs in wyvern*
---
Also the quickest response.
---
I believe it usually has to do with how eve and the client sometimes display things that can’t actually be locked, like someone who just cloaked but is still visible. It’s for those edge cases between ticks where display hasn’t caught up to reality. Not necessarily lag, just what happens when your game runs at 1hz.
---
ECM will tell you that you have reached your max of 0 locked targets. And damps will tell you that you are out of range. 
---
its possible that he had mods that made my locking range short, however the first failed lock at around 2-4km which seems pretty impossible unless he's got some sort of insane implant set  i don't know about.
---
Then you get some one that's hovering over the warp button
---
that makes sense, he probably cloaked and stayed on my overview. which is why even when he was 9km away it showed him as unlockable but still visible
---
You said it yourself, getting awox characters into Horde isn't hard...
---
So many of them! That's some 2013 carrier level shit
---
Why can't you add armor to your shield caps?
---
Why didnt you guys bat phone for the sweet sweet marginis kill last week?
---
I wasn't there. I can't attest to them being hit with 35 bombs. It could just be a number you made up. Look at my upvotes - look at yours. You're wrong.
---
Man I fucking hate titles like this. Great pic tho
---
Think about it for a bit ...
---
There is a magic number - I think its 7. 8th bomb will wipe all of the bombs. 
---
I'm pretty sure Horde has a policy of accepting everyone, regardless of name. Innocent until proven guilty.
---
AT died for resource wars : p
---
This message can be caused by a number of things ( senor boosters with eccm scripts , them cloaking , or warping off . It also depends on what your scan res is normal explorer fits  have something like 40 signature size. In wolf-rayet wormholes they have a signature reduction from 10% to 50 ish %. 
---
I'd x up with that fleet.
---
Found Razor.
---
It means you weren't able to lock the target.
---
You think pulling range is what you are suppose to do against battleship guns for sig tanking?? You pull range to force battleships in to long range ammo.  
---
I was going to give you the benefit of the doubt, despite your Imperium reddit tag, but you literally are an F1 pusher that has no idea what you are talking about.
---
Back to the fitting window I go!
---
&gt;you have to pull range and use spike to get that sig tank working nicely vs battleship guns.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;??????
---
Just goon things.
---
As you said, you’re just a fleet member in CVA, so you didn’t see all the shit we had to deal with. Don’t characterize what we went through because you weren’t the one that went through it. We didn’t leave because things were low. We left because CVA left us. I’m not going to go through the whole laundry list of things they didn’t deem important because we’d be here forever.
---
Push away *your* grudge. You’re the one who brought up the structures in the first place. That was more than a year ago. I only bring it up when EQ &amp; friends want to try to publicly pretend that history isn’t a thing.
---
But instead of talking about the past, let’s talk about the present: https://zkillboard.com/region/10000047/top/year/2019/month/3/. And we are just getting started.
---
Bought mine at release price. Left work, went to Starbucks for WiFi, smashed refresh :)
---
at your local jita scammer
---
Ah well, I'll never be as good as I want to be, because I'll always want to be better!
---
Truth is no one ever got to be good at anything without practice, and practice means failing, a lot
---
It would be super hard but doable. I think your best bet would be flying SOCT ships or something easy to build, with drone bonuses so you don't need to build ammo nonstop.
---
cant use the t2s man :(
---
Agreed
---
no idea man
---
thanks for watching man o7
---
Yeah but the thing is one of those drones is an awoxer for eBay! Shits about to go down
---
Yea the cinematics are pretty crap now. Its really hard to do anything nice since the camera changes, I considered dropping them from the vid all together tbh but will see for the next few. Thanks for the feedback, and for watching o7 
---
Templeman was the first FC I flew under, now I FC alongside him. Amazing dude. Hopefully he doesn’t disappear to star citizen again lol 
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/75969702/ this is the fit in the video
---
in most contexts it means they cloaked. Leaving system or them warping will have their own messages
---
&gt;Suggestions?
---
Yes.  Stop fucking posting. 
---
razor still exists?
---
Ah he's got a 150 on there. Mine's 200 derp!
---
&gt;Darkness. showing up in corms.. why would anyone even stay in GOTG these days
---
Shhhhh let's build them up so they can be farmed.
---
Wouldnt a better idea be Miner War's but instead of just clearing the site by filling up the hauler, your doing it in Abyss and having to clear the site and hull the hauler before the time runs out, then just like the pve version your gona lose your shit if you dont mine enough fast enough.
---
PS. I thot miner wars was actually really well designed but because CCP gave it terrible rewards no one does it and they CCP are probably now going to remove it from the game, just like CCP to half ass something that's potentially amazing and then use their low participation numbers which resulted from them half assing it as an excuse to drop it from the game.
---
This is beautiful. You should be proud.
---
You seem to be pretty up and up on these, so maybe you can answer my question. I was doing T3 Electricals, first in a Cerberus then a Zealot, and most of the rooms are silly easy (and more so in the Zealot) except for one - it's a swarm of Damaviks, some with Web, others with TD and TP, and others just for DPS. The issue I run in to is their logi - I'm doing decent damage, but in both cases, I lost the ship because I just couldn't break them fast enough.
---
Have you encountered this one before, and do you know the secret sauce to getting through it?
---
Thanks for posting video, this sounded like an interesting fight!
---
thanks ^^
---
It is a new 2v2 tournament that they are doing this year, winners get to compete in the grand finals at next years Fanfest in Iceland.

---
Keep in mind post patch the rag will get an extra 16m shield buffer. 
---
As you can see the rag has 10% more EHP, 10% more damage and 18% more rep power per fax.
---
Unless I'm missing something?
---
Maybe he double clicked a cloak prevents u from locking for a few sec9nds
---
I got mine at that price as well.  Did not take long to sell those out.  Would be interested to know how many are offered at each price point.
---
I can mine. Mining is allowed :) I haven’t found a salvager yet. So no salvage. But I’ve been lucky finding lots of drones :)
---
"whoa is me" lol!  name checks out.
---
I always say this but. GOD DAMN does null anoms and what not need reworked, I can bearly stomach it most the times.
---
*Dedicated cap ship anoms would be nice to*
---
I would day trip whs but some ass will close it behind me because. "My safe krabing, I don't like wormholes."
---
Sometimes when ships transition from an unlockable state to another unlockable state (wapring/breaking gate cloak to the landing invul timer/cloaking) your targeting process should be interrupted. However, if you initiate lock on the same tick, you may enter a complete locking cycle that is destined to fail at the end. This locking cycle cannot be interrupted by another locking command. This is less detrimental when you fly like a frigate, but very bad when you fly slow locking ships!
---
Me too, the $150 and $175 price points were sold out within 10-15 min
---
I got dragged into a meeting at work and missed both. First time I haven't managed to get at least the super early bird offer lol.
---
Yeah I thought I remembered it was 6 or 7. Read up on it once but don't remember which. That's why I think the unspecified commands to launch all bombs lead to overlap and reduced damage. 
---
Really well done. Use anything besides pyrolancea? 
---
Give me one shot with a tornado, it's all I ask
---
If they want to krab to build me more spaceships to lose, fine by me.  I'd probably quit if I had to manufacture all my crap from scrap.
---
Loved the video.  I fly the Jag all the time in FW specifically as anti-kyte support. I'm going to try out your fits for solo pvp.  
---
What are your recommended drugs and implants?  I'm considering genos.
---
I call bullshit. There are no Eve players that are this meta that are 125lbs.
---
I was using it with blue pill + pyro but ran out of blue pill fairly quickly. 901 rockets and 1001 rapid launch are nice and cheap, but if you're lowsec then probably 903 and 1003 are good choices.
---
Vexor Amazon Issue.
---
If eveon is not working, evenova is a pretty good backup
---
dominix prototype.
---
But just think of the amusement we'll get out of people flying with mixed sets of shield and armor slaves. Someone might even use a shield slave omega with an armor set or vice versa.
---
If you're using genos then you could rework the entire fit to make it better as it's very tight on fitting. I was personally using standard blue pill + pyro II with 901 rockets and 1001 rapid launch. In lowsec might as well go for 903 and 1003 though.
---
It means they activated their ~~invulnerability~~ cloaking device but your client's commands were too slow to lock the target due to server ticks/lock speed/whatever and they are cloaked but the server info hasn't fully reached you yet.
---
Basically you see guy, attempt to lock him. He attempts to cloak, his cloak input happens before the server registers you successfully locking him, so he cloaks and your lock fails. 
---
Shhhhh!
---
Jesus man, don't clue them in.
---
Very well could have been the case. Someone just uploaded bomber footage from the fight. I don't see the 35 bombs the guy above were talking about - maybe that many over the course of a few minutes, but definitely not in coordinated waves. Lots of time for T2 logi to rep the damage and keep guys up.
---
Yeah we really need more instanced abyss stuff in our open world game
---
Yeah I think if they would have coordinated bomb volleys instead of just tossing bombs wildly they would have had a better faster result.
---
Have you tried the advanced camera? I have no idea how to use it but they said it was for you guys. *youtubers / content creators* and have no idea if its any good at all but never know lol.
---
o7 see you around mate. Love your stuff
---
oh yeah, i brought up the structures in the first place, because whenever a yulai guy thinks he should shit on CVA, i wanna make him remember how much the line members felt kicked in the nuts by their alliance's leader.
---
you hate the alliance because you don't feel appreciated by its leader? so i'm giving you a mirror and tell you how we feel about yulai because of the action of a single person of yours.
---
ah, the KB epeen! yes, keep it on.
---
I've been using a machariel as well. Been doing full clears. It feels slow a bit. I'm new as well and have imperfect skills. I think I have 7 mil SP.
---
I like to think of it like this: As far as the game is concerned, your ship at stop doesn't point in any direction, or put another way, it points in all directions simultaneously.
---
For anyone having trouble with mentally judging this, I challenge them to test aligning an industrial from 0ms.
---
Your alignment time when your ship model is pointed in any direction will be the same if your velocity is 0ms. An industrial is a good cheap way to demonstrate this in game to those having doubts - as they should have - from random people posting advice.
---
I tried running C3 sites in a HAM loki but wasnt impressed with the clear times because of the webs and the Ham range. What am I missing here? Do I need to be making a bookmark and warping out and back in or something?
---
Can't wait to hijack one.
---
shoot the drones and then it can't do shit.  
---
I like the Paladin b/c I can use T1 ammo for most things, and maybe some Scorch ammo for the really distant stuff. So I don't need piles of ammo, which means I have room for piles of loot =)
---
Just toss an MTU in the hold, and a wing of Salvager Drones in the bay, and you're all set.
---
The alliance contest is an attendance contest we host each year.

I used to be able to just drop athanors/tataras from my overview and things would be roughly ok
---
now I get fucking blinded by the wall of goddamn faction fucking fortizars. I'm pretty sure this is a tuz conspiracy to force people to go out on sig and squads deployments so they don't have to deal with this shit.
---
Nothin u good. Im js thats what happens.

Are they all fuels and fits ?

A gross display of power

krabbing in WHs is even safer and more lucrative than KSpace

Judging from the poster the United States beat you to that on August 5th and 9th, 1945.

Citadels were a mistake

So the story I see here is , you get the drop of people who think "its just a Jaguar"  
---
and every now n then you fight someone who knows its not "just a jaguar" and you die.

like here  [https://zkillboard.com/related/30003125/201903310000/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30003125/201903310000/)

Correct me if Im wrong. Im total shit at Solostuff, but im trying to get better. It appears like youre trying to control who engages very tightly.  
---
Having twice the updoots as the parent comment isn't underated.
---
Especially since attempting to get there through the community page still sends you to the 2018  information.  They seriously need to update their website.
---
Yeah clear times aren't great in a solo t3. As for ranges spawn patterns are predictable so you can burn for the right spot once you get to know them.

---
lovely*
---
you are trying to overthink it ... this message just says that he was not there already, eg. cloaked/inwarp whatever, even when cloaked ship is 1-2s on overview and grid till dissapear, same with jumping thru the gate.
---
I'm a simple man, I see Allu posting a PVP video, I upvote! 
---
IDK about one station per system, but limiting them via ADM somehow would probably be good?  
---
Can anyone break down pros/cons of that? 
---
Don't kink shame them bro, they're just really into Pandas.
---
On second thought, let's not go to Delve. 'tis a silly place.
---
Don't know what to tell you, that's what has been happening. Very rarely do we have a string of battleship targets that just die every time.
---
What is confusing about the second part?
---
So, would it be way better with 2 lokis then?
---
Umad?
---
because theyre massively tanked, can pop out of nearly nowhere, and do great dps even against small shit. its a "fuck you i win" button
---
I know but using the overview for navigation is a 5 year old habbit.
---
You seem butthurt. Might want to see the proctologist. Just a heads up.
---
Idk what kind of goalposts you're trying to put up for us, we've been very successful in our deployment so far. The dead ihub count is probably almost triple digits at this point, not to mention all the other structures.
---
I was looking at the kill mails, where you'll see the damage done from the bombs also varies, clearly indicating the ability to mitigate damage by moving faster.
---
You don't need to be there to read a killmail. ROFL at using upvotes to determine who's correct, you're sounding like our idiot of a president.
---
What about in mission sites? I've seen some corps putting ess in burner sites to steal from sov owners in null.
---
This is perfection! Bravo!!
---
How about just one per planet ... simpler to make happen and still cuts the number WAY down ...

Also makes battles to install a staging citadel matter
---
Eh, it's Querns, he says some ridiculous things in seriousness. But he whooshed me so I guess so.
---
Good pro-panda propaganda. It seems to be at the center of the composition, idk.
---
Uhm, that is exactly what I'm describing, but okay. Pull range, both sides have to use lower damage ammo, but ehp stays the same, so regardless of closing the dps gap you are still losing dps vs something with a much larger buffer, allowing even more time for reps to land.
---
Drone Hp halfed btw.
---

---
It must be auditory hallucinations, because eve doesnt have sound.
---
That wont need to be nerfed.
---
Good job for being honest:) not /s
---
Oh I didn’t know that. How long has that been going on? (Curious if my old alliance is on there)
---
"Shoot the drones! Shoot the damn drones! Shit, how many drones does it have?!"
---
Thanks! I think I had something like that in mind when i shot the clips haha. :)
---
Do you sell any of your work?
---
Pros: It's something to limit this absurd crap.
---
Cons: ADMs fluctuate wildly all the time and it would be a huge pain in the balls to have your shit power down/unanchor because your main Krab Man with 20 Rorq alts went on vacation.  
---
There's a difference between ships that are ludicrously difficult to obtain because they come from special events, and ships that are "difficult" to obtain because of resources and manpower required to obtain them. Rorqs are easy to build. They should be balanced around that fact, not the skills required.   
---
This is how T2 and faction ships are balanced, not based on skills but on the value of the labor required to obtain them. EVE should never boil down to who spent the most time idling in station while keeping their account plexed, or who spent the most on skill injectors. 
---
Thanks! I actually shot the clips just when the new gate graphics came, but kinda ended up not publishing the vid and just forgot it in my yt.
---
Found the edge
---
Hmm... maybe I could do something that is only timelapse-based... thanks for giving me ideas. :)
---
Thanks!
---
Obviously.
---
I will fight anything I have a chance at beating. I was for obvious reasons not trying to actually fight 2 Gilas, 2 Daredevils and a HIC.
---
Thanks!

I want to buy 1y Omega if it is cheap as I thought in my country. I play on steam. There is a omega time plan deal at steam. "700x at checkout, auto-renewed every 12 month(s) at 180x as determined by your game account. " I get -%61 discount acording to steam and I LOVE this deal. 
---
But am I supposed to pay original 1y sub money (700x) for first year? 
---

---
That got an IRL chuckle from me

---
You can run C3 sites in a loki, I think a gila can too maybe.
---
This is a pretty accurate statement. Just because everyone doesn't get along with everyone, it doesn't immediately mean thunderdome and one person is out. A large group of people with have different subsets of friends and that's ok.
---
&gt;when you have to pull range and use spike to get that **sig tank working nicely** vs battleship guns.
---
This doesn't mean what you think this means. Sig tanking increases effectiveness the closer you are to the target to get under the guns. The farther away you are, the better Battleship guns track, even while afterburning.
---
&gt;but ehp stays the same
---
No it doesn't - afterburning HACs reduce application which can effectively increases their EHP to that of a Battleship. Sometimes even more so if you get properly signature tank under the battleship turret track speed. The reason you had to stay at range is because even while afterburning Baal webs would have shit on you.  
---
HACs will apply close to full spike damage on a battleship in optimal; Battleships will still have trouble applying due to the afterburners (but still track better than if you were closer). The combination of application issues and ammo ranges really closes both the EHP and damage difference between HACs and T1 BS. On top of that good luck successfully bombing HACs, whereas (as proved by this BR) T1 battleships are basically the perfect target.  
---
So in terms of being "outshipped" you are not correct.
---
Outstanding work

It is so gratifying to see so much beautiful art being made in and about New Eden.

I’ve been saying it for years: somebody’s going to make their Ph.D. dissertation on the art and propaganda of EVE Online.

Structure spam makes this game worse by removing the requirement to make tactical choices based on space geography.

Eve - I was there.
---
They were warned repeatedly that this is what happens when you allow free for all player housing. 
---
If you're a hostile, you gotta think to yourself, "man, if only we had dropped on goon supercaps as they exited from their soda factory system. They were in range of our stager and all it would have taken is for my lazy leadership to have logged in and lit a cyno. If we'd done that, none of this would have come to pass."
---

---
Poe-tay-toe.
---
All I did was ask politely for something that is pretty critical to the point of the thread.
---
This is a good point.
---
&gt; And turn off AB
---
I dumped my 100MN for a 10MN and haven't looked back. If you're already in a cycle, turning it off might not help in enough time to escape. I have yet to lose a VNI to rats since dropping down to 10MN. 
---
Everyone cries about citadels but in reality if a group has 100 citadels in a system it doesn't really make much difference. If they can defend one of them they can defend 100. If they are unable to defend and save one the other 99 are essentially as good as dead anyway.

In my time, we basically had dying training. We would skirmish in frigates, get used to getting popped, and train the insta pod warp out technique. 
---
I was awesome to train our nerves and made new players learn much faster how to keep calm during engagement. 
---
Practically speaking, yes. Provided you're shooting an non-garbage ammo type in the SFI or looking to get out in the case of that loki, the neut is what changes the situation. 
---
Even for the kikimora, turning off the jag's AB or forcing him to orbit wide means you're tracking him better, and most kiki vs jag fights should end in the kikimora's favor because that gun has ridiculous tracking
---
Test and Goons beat MC the years we attended.
---
I don't do titans, but just from a simple thought. Armor can catch reps for shield since they deplete quickly. But if shield can't catch armor since they be in shield mostly chances are. 
---
Not really, morale and attrition for both sides and for the defender it's easier 
---
CCP When is there a max cap of citadels in one system?! (bound to ADM maybe?)
---
Bud we hit them with multiple waves and they did some repping in between waves. bombs are a great tool against battleships and the only reason they died was because they over extended the fleet away from horde. That let us kill their mjd/defender command destroyers which is the only thing that made those rattles viable  away from triage.
---
&gt;Brand Newbros
---
LOL
---
Except, no, because bashing a billion structures is fucking aids and a major logistical challenge, not to mention a major morale drag
---
A bit late for that. Was proposed when they hit SiSi, but CCP competent.
---
Just as long as you're still my space friend Sharnhorst. Because by god almighty, Team Suit and Beard needs to happen for CSM 14
---
Really should be 1 player station per like 20-40au and figure out a minimum au away from each station. This 1000km nonsense is beyond annoying. 
---
The citadel lag on the overview fucks me up too. I'm rushing through systems and 5 cits pop up on the overview after a short delay... 
---
This cannot be what CCP intended... CCPlz fix
---
Says the sales team to the engineering team... Lol
---
Yeah no shit, that was pretty impressive considering he was pretty much cap dry half the time
---
Now that GOTG has gone the full goonpet maybe they can have one or two of their fortizars back as a treat?
---
Stop judging my judgement, bro.
---
Simple question, I've always been tempted by this game, and finally I have some time to try it, so, is it too late to start? are there any "catch up" mechanics? , if so, is there a way to play/level up with combat (NPCs, or something) instead of mining? 
---
This is an interesting narrative. Why do people think they are "goon pets"? Not trolling, I really don't know.
---
Okay, fair enough, T1 battleships are probably on a close to even playing field with HACs in the right situation, however that is a pretty different story when you're talking about rattlesnakes.
---
why angry
---
Eve 2019
---
They didnt seem to be pets in low sec a few nights ago. Just bad as usual. People are dumb.
---
Your idea is bad for the exact same reason NPC shipyards failed
---
Yes we surrender. You goonpets are the new elite of Eve!
---
i think hes a pvper for the game, lol dumbass
---
Hahahaa oh man that's fucked up. Beautiful
---
At least that's got a big payoff if it works.  Stupid long odds but it's only gotta work once to be legendary.  Pointing/bursting logi at random, not even when we try to warp, is just...throwing it away for nothing.
---
Nomad fleets are the best.
---
The only attractive of goon fights are their numbers, besides that all fights are shit
---
Beautiful.
---
Yeah that makes sense, but you can see the amount of damage on the killmails varied for each of the bombs that hit, so it's clearly not all applying perfectly.
---
Hi,
---
I am a newbie. Could you please explain shortly who are goons? 
---
Don't change your habits of using the overview. Just stay out of 1DQ. ez pz. :P
---
Major logistical challenge ? If your there to kill one your already set up to do the rest. 
---
As for bashing a bazillion structures if you've broken the hostile to the point you can kill a citadel in a home system, you'll probably only get resistance for the next few after that it's just a active dread per citadel. 
---
If that's too much effort you could argue you shouldn't be trying to evict someone 
---
I’m a long-time Alpha player who knows the ropes of the game somewhat.
---
About a year ago, I got myself an Exequror (is that how you spell it? :P) which as far as I can tell is the best ship an Alpha player can get despite it actually being trash. I also fit it with all the most expensive modules I could find, and trained skills up to the cap for Alpha players (which isn’t very high).
---
EVE has a super interesting universe but my only issue is how F2P-unfriendly it is. In a couple weeks I exhausted all the content that was available to me and shortly after even exhausted the passive skill gain system!
---
I really don’t want to put in the huge grind to get just 30 days of Omega after which I’m back to square one. Hours of grinding or a hole in my wallet just for 30 days of proper gameplay before I lose everything? No thank you, I’ll just go play Elite Dangerous.
---
So Omega doesn’t seem very worthwhile to me. I don’t want to pay just for 30 days... so what is there left to do in EVE? I’ve fulfilled all the potential the devs have allowed me, so now what? (Rather than mindless grinding for the sake of grinding or grinding for Omega, which once again doesn’t seem too valuable)
---
Thanks for the help! :)
---
Can this painting break the 1k mark??? It'd be a first for me \^\^
---
Great, now I need to get a Dreadnought.
---
I already said that for as long as I’m living in Delve, I am NOT a member of the Imperium, and I don’t think they would like to see a neutral Dreadnought going around in the belts of NPC nullsec, riiight under their supercapital umbrella. 
---
Don’t know why, just a stray thought like that coming in me mind.
---
That’s quite nice ! I’ve trained the skills for a Loki, with T2 turrets and all Subsystems skills to V. Could be an interesting ship
---
I guess I could've worded it differently, I just meant I was shocked how well he did under heavy neut pressure sometimes. Or maybe I misunderstood you, idk
---
genos
---
&gt;however that is a pretty different story when you're talking about rattlesnakes.
---
I'd say for pirate faction battleships that is likely a fair statement in most cases concerning HACs.
---
A bit like Sort.
---

---
Except no. Because with that many structures, you're going to have conflicting timers. You can't just do them all at the same time. Now, of course, if you have more people you can do more timers at once. As per your comment we'll assume these structures are unmanned and undefended. You still need 30+ people bashing a fort for 30 minutes if not more, for a hundred structures. And I'd the structures are set up well, you better believe the timers on the same grid will overlap. So now you need a massive number of people, split into a massive number of fleets. Sure you can siege a single dread. Then it might take 90 minutes to bash through each structure. And even then you'll need enough people, enough dreads, and a defense fleet in standby the entire time this is going on, because just because the locals have given up doesn't mean other people aren't going to try and pick off bash ships for easy frags. 
---
We're talking hundreds of man hours to deal with this. Across at least a hundred people. To, keep in mind, take one, undefended system. A single system. A null block has dozens or hundreds of systems.
---
And more than anything else it's just a bad game mechanic. It's boring, unengaging, and unrewarding. At least when I drag my Corp along to bash 20 structures in three days I, can motivate them with loot, but in nullsec you get literally nothing but some empty undefended killmails for kicking over a hundred cits.
---
non-sequitur
---
you shouldn't take someone's corp into consideration; Tomalak flew with KarmaFleet for over a year until they stopped paying peacetime SRP.
---
I am a quite capable python programmer (you are a mediocre cynic at best) and this would be relatively easy to implement. The aforementioned mechanics that would be used are contemporary (so the spaghetti-code unintended consequences should be mitigated) and could be done with a minimum of new code. The biggest strain should be potential TiDi events on a particular node.  
---
This makes sense, and is my thoughts as well about wanting to fight things.  
---
Granted you probably overpower Defenseless VNIs nonstop. The Dominix kills are impressive (timing crucial).  
---
What id like to know is the anatomy of your loss. Who was the initial target? a daredevil? the gila? who engaged first..and it what point did you know you were g oign to die due to getting blobbed out.  
---
These are the sorts of concerns I have about solostuff
---
Lol link your GitHub 
---
Which is why the bombers were necessary, and why the mistake of getting too far from their allies caused the fleet wipe.
---
&gt;I'm pretty sure this is a tuz conspiracy to force people to go out on sig and squads deployments so they don't have to deal with this shit.
---
you know too much
---
You posted this 4 hours after feeding winterco like you were the host of my 600lb life. Well done 
---
I'd like to say thank you for all of the drones I've taken while solo roaming
---
In what universe would this accomplish anything?  The big ratting "offenders" don't really hold that much space, and rental empires could just split into region-specific holding alliances with basically no impact.
---
That was the Esoteria fun police. If they detect you are having too much fun, they will camp your out-gate for hours waiting for you to leave. With 2 (resebo'd) Daredevil webs on grid, you have no chance of making it back to the gate / and or running the camp before dying. 
---
there was a threat 2 days ago with the same question :&gt;
---
cant find it right now, scroll a bit i´d say :D
---
Look at the difference in upvotes, acknowledge the fact that this guy knows more about the game than you, give up the fight, and be grateful for learning more about fleet mechanics and strategy.
---
Ignoring useful knowledge to talk out of your ass to defend propaganda isn't worth it my dude.
---
It's both. Logistics and logi
---
The general idea is that Goons are so polarizing and so *evil* that any attitude that's even a slightly bit short of "total, vocal, multi-generational enmity" constitutes submission and pet status.
---
There are still some of us that had sufficient goon inspired autism to Fozzie Sov bash the north 2 years ago. I think we could do it again given the opportunity.
---
Welcome, traveller, to Delve-a-lago! 
---
Every guest at our luxury resort is treated to their own faction fortizar to stay in, with sweeping views of the supercap umbrella and the spod mountains.
---
Your faction fortizar is fully staffed by GOTG line members, shuffling about plumping the pillows and emptying the trash. Ask them for anything you need!
---
So, traveller, come stay at Delve-a-Lago today, and help Make Eve Great Again!
---
Don't get me wrong, there's only two groups in the game who could motivate me to that levels of autism to burn them out of eve. Goons are in that list. But it didn't work last time, why would it work this time. Good luck motivating people to do that again. 
---
Salty Horde confirmed.
---
There are no ADMs in lowsec/j-space/highsec. Limiting would be nice though. 
---
Hes right, wh guys love to have people join them, but its a way diffrent culture

**Fyre Festival** was a failed "luxury music festival" founded by Billy McFarland, CEO of Fyre Media Inc, and rapper Ja Rule. It was created with the intent of promoting the company's Fyre app for booking music talent. The festival was scheduled to take place from April 28–30 and May 5–7, 2017, on the Bahamian island of Great Exuma.
---
The event was promoted on Instagram by "social media influencers" including socialite and model Kendall Jenner, as well as models Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski, many of whom did not initially disclose they had been paid to do so.\[1\] During the Fyre Festival's inaugural weekend, the event experienced problems related to security, food, accommodation, medical services and artist relations, resulting in the festival being postponed indefinitely. Instead of the luxury villas and gourmet meals for which festival attendees paid thousands of dollars, they received prepackaged sandwiches and FEMA tents as their accommodation.\[2\]
---
As a result, the organizers are the subject of at least eight lawsuits, several seeking class action status, and one seeking more than $100 million in damages. The cases accuse the organizers of defrauding ticket buyers. On June 30, 2017, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York charged McFarland\[1\] with one count of wire fraud.\[3\] In March 2018, he pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud to defraud investors and a second count to defraud a ticket vendor. On October 11, 2018, McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to forfeit US $26 million.
---
Two documentaries about the events of the festival were released in 2019: Hulu's *Fyre Fraud*,\[4\] and Netflix's *Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened*.\[5\]\[6\]
---
Alright cheers, ill see if I can find it, in the mean time ill leave this post up
---
That's why I think it might be good for me, something I've never done before
---
whsoc is pretty welcoming to pve people as far as I know 
---
It is a bit confusing but "healer ships" just sounds lame. We make the distinction with logistics(fun and necessary) and tactical logistics(mostly not fun but necessary).
---
must.. not .. reply.. to.. querns.. argh.. can't do it! 
---
There was no tether delay back then, you could move supers with invulnerability.
---
Yes, that word is used incorrectly. Triage would be better.
---
Which is especially infuriating when the game has content which would use the word correctly but it's not used for that.
---
Technically, the problem isn’t structure spam. It’s how stupidly difficult to destroy structures that cause the problem
---
Gotta make a choice, you only get one structure per moon/planet, which type his your priority?
---
This already sounds way better than the current version.
---
I have a "bug out" overview with just planets/gates on it. Really helps in high traffic systems.

You probably mean a 360 friend
---
Wait, do we have 3 Keepstars there now?  Those distances don't look right for one to have been renamed.
---
I mean, how many things in EVE was CCP warned about way before it turned into a clusterfuck ?
---
Well yeah but if ya wanna kill a cap spawn you need lots off tank and at lest 3k dps, for just a dread spawn. So unless you becoming one off us just avoid  like the plage, "titan spawns will one shoot sub caps"
---
every day im amazed at how little about sov i know (probably shouldnt be). maybe ADMs wouldnt be the best mechanic.... or maybe no citadels in low/high...   
---
(hides in bunker)
---
With the Cerb (which has a web and an application rig + implants) I just kill the TD ships and other EWAR then dps ships and deal with the logi later. 
---
I get the room a lot but with 700+ dps frig logi don't beat you.
---
I have only ever used Missile (Cerb) and Drone boats (Gila) though, can't imagine Zealots hold up well in the Abyss since their guns are so cap reliant.
---
Application is key to frig rooms (web and rig) or you just tickle them with HAMs.
---
My vintage i5 CPU would definitely appreciate me doing that.
---
Shhh dont say that! ;) 
---
Oh yeah, I don’t want to fuck with those to be honest
---
I don’t even know what they drop. Capital or loads of T2 salvage, maybe ? If it’s just an oversized bounty I’d be disappointed.
---
but wormholes
---
throw some factionbois in there, they're cheapo
---
None shall pass , T5Z -1DQ jump gate !
---
Logis should be more precisely described as "triage ships"
---
Ok thanks so much 
---
Dreads big bounty 0-25mill normal  salavage, an mats for meta capital modules like dark blood cap guns,
---
Darkblood dreads the same + any dark blood module anc 0-30 mill if not more salvage,
---
Darkblood titans all the above 0-1.2bill in tech one and some times tech 2 salavge as well as bpcs for dark blood capital modules an guns
---
https://youtu.be/zSR7o5mMlEE
---
I would base it on the number of moons in a system, with an additional limiter of 2 xl, and 4 large per system. This would allow people to still have a keepstar and a sotiyo in the same system, and mine all their moons if they chose to. 
---
Oooh, now that’s shiny 
---
You haven’t mentioned regular blood Titans, they doesn’t exist ?
---
And woah, 1.2. billions of salvage sounds great 
---
If you like afk-mining/industry and want to play casually without always being on alert there’s definitely some places around with nice people. I think you’ll find more of that playstyle in high sec though as it’s just more tailored to casual play. A lot of people knock this (and it’s not for me) but it definitely has its place. I have a Corp in mind if you’re interested, though I’d have to ping someone and see if they’re still around/active.
---
Citadels should be limited to planets, Engineering complexes and refineries can go on moons. 
---
First point an exequror isn’t the best ship an alpha can get. Alphas can even fly up to battleships now. 
---
An exequror is a space priest. It’s for repairing armour on other ships. There is rarely a best ship in Eve there is just different. 
---
Alpha is meant to be a taste of the game to make you subscribe and to add content to the game for paying players. It’s a subscription model game with an unlimited trial that some people are getting great enjoyment out of. 
---
Sounds like you might not be in a corp or going on fleets because that’s a huge part of the game for a lot of people that alphas can participate in just fine. 
---
But at the end of the day yes Omega is going to be the much better experience. It’s a subscription based game and I’m really not sure what you’re expecting there. 
---
What is there to loose to try it? I mean. Join a Corp. Try it out. If you don't like it then leave them again. 
---
Have you picked up any fun/super useful drops? Where do you spend most of your time?
---
Toaster Strudel* 
---
It’s not too late to start. 
---
You can pay real money and buy plex to sell in game and get skill points to apply to your character to catch up if you wish. Very expensive though. 
---
Skills train in real time. No matter how much you do in game you aren’t going to level anything up. 
---
You never have to mine a single thing outside the tutorial if you so choose. I have never ever mined since day 1 in the game. 
---
They didn't let 'Goon Dictor Alt' in, for some reason.
---
Form what ive seen no only dark blood
---
What is this GOTG you speaking of? They are called Dead Coalition since a year now
---
This is a common question - the short answer is no, it's not too late. New players start the game every day. There are *some* catch-up mechanics (look up skill injectors), but I wouldn't really worry about them. The skill system in this game is designed to be broad but shallow, meaning you can max out one ship/gameplay type relatively quickly, but it takes a long time to master everything. 
---
Thank you!
---
The daily skill boosters cost some 60 million ISK... just not a practical price, meaning it’s difficult to get to the point where I can fly a battleship. If I’m unwilling to put in that grind or buy Omega, what is left for me to do in Eve?
---
This is a bad post and you should feel bad.
---
The [Eve Uni Lexicon](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/EVE_Lexicon) is pretty good but doesn't cover everything.
---
Prefer GOTG. Their new name is too self-aware.
---
Isn't triage the process of sorting the wounded into categories based on severity and not actually healing itself?
---
I would look at it from the in game perspective where a logistics ship is sending magical repairing nanites out to the other ships. Also they do have other bonuses in the form of remote cap or remote tracking which is more inline with the actual definition of logistics
---
&gt; the detailed coordination of a complex operation involving many people, facilities, or supplies.
---
Though I guess the Monitor should be a Logistics ship and then we can delete the Flag Cruiser skill.
---
If we don’t plan on attending the party, can we give that ticket to someone else? 
---
"People in a t1 destroyer please don't spam repair request, if you die, you die, nobody cares"
---
EVE event taking place on the west coast of the United States? Open tickets for sale during EUTZ, eight hours before those on the west coast of the United States get home from work. Thus, you guarantee that most people closest to the event can't get the cheapest tickets.
---
Well done, CCP. Don't ever change.
---
I'm attempting to build a corp with these activities being one of our central gameplay focuses. Would you possibly be interested in joining up (maybe on an alt) and being a part of it?
---
They're basically the Thalmor of Eve.
---
Stupid. 
---
Nah man, it's never too late. Brave newbies is a great beginner friendly corp too if you wanted a recommendation. But basically you train for 'roles". To start in PvP you'll spend time training to be 'tackle' so your job will be to get up in the enemies face and warp disrupt them. This basically  stops them from running away while your bigger friend blap them.at the same time you'll be trying to avoid getting blapped yourself. Then you may want to specialise in frigates or move up to a different class of ships. You also need to consider a way of finding yourself, in brave newbies they'll give you free ships to start but planetary management or exploration are easy/fun ways for newbies to get money.
---
Won’t some drop from faction rats like other implants do? 
---
&gt; nothing to do with shipping and receiving
---
To be fair, logistics ships repair armour and hull by sending swarms of nanobots to their target (and energy to boost shields). It has everything to do with sending and receiving.
---
Pretty
---
i feel like you missed the most important ship in eve. Friendship (lol w.e its true) eve is better in pretty much every way with friends.
---
 " In a couple weeks I exhausted all the content that was available to me "
---
i doubt it but the best content in the game comes not from the game it self exactly. but from the interactions you will have with different people and groups in this shared world. find a corp, make some friends, try stupid shit, and most importantly go fight people.
---
Ah, LXQ2. We once broke the player record in that system, going over 3k
---
gons 2019
---
I have an implant worth like 250mill that I have no use for yet. On my main it woulda been sold pretty quick :) I base out of Stacmon. I just created this character recently. I used to do it as a side project of my main. He would go there like a vacation from Corp life. But then I decided I liked it enough to make a fresh alpha that lives there permanently. 
---
I agree. But it does pinpoint the absolute boringness of it. 
---
A lot of us would want to buy one of thise thing
---
Also I would buy the causal version, you know when you have to fill area with a number inside with one color
---
But eve marchandise is only in boring stuff like glass, cup our tshirt sadly
---
Gret job, continue !!
---
Indeed. Until that magnificent bomb run it looked to be headed for a solid if unremarkable victory for NCPL. If that bomb run didn't land the GOON/Init side had maybe 12-15 mins of fight left in them.
---
Escalating fuel or anchor fees when
---
if you're idea of having a future involves letting people summon dead space pockets anywhere they want so they can anchor structures there to rob people ratting in system in such a way that they can't catch you no matter what counter they employ and you can just take their money and run away in a nullified T3C or inty whenever you want then this probably wasn't the game for you in the first place.
---
Mobile motor pool.
---
Stranger Danger is recruiting! Our home just got wiped by Inner Hell so in the next few days we’ll be relocating into new hole. You can be part of this!
---
We’ll teach you to pvp and make some isk. Its fun, always something to blow up :)
---
Hit me in game on Meneer Wolf
---
Fire Coalition, will going, and 2 weeks later back to home all naked \^\^....
---
You're transporting hit points/capacitor to the damaged ship. 
---
&gt; and figure out a minimum au away from each station. This 1000km nonsense is beyond annoying.
---
Sure. The only reason these stations are grouped like that is so that nobody can anchor a skynet citadel within range of the keepstar. If the minimum distance was always multiple grids apart that wouldn't be necessary.
---
Nice video!
---
I dropped some of your fits into pyfa, I'm not understanding how you have enough cpu for this fit without a cpu implant.
---
What would you say TDF averages in terms of ISK/h? Are they predominantly EUTZ, or can HQ fleets be found in any time zone?
---
Wow... I read the title and thought “this should be interesting”  but I was wrong.
---
Goons being turboautistic people, more news at seven.
---
At least Test use their faction fort on deployment but goonies prefer to had another tower on thei sandcast and nobody care except them.
---
Eve is in sader state day after day..
---
It does require a 2% CPU implant.
---
i endorse this product and/or service
---
Its Space Paladin!!
---
the save cyno guy donated a keepstar, he's a true goon hero
---
Grr
---
Awesome rendition of a beautiful ship.
---
Remember: Teaching new players how to pvp is bad. Instead, be a bittervet like this guy and do nothing to contribute to the health of the game.
---
Inner Hell rock &lt;3
---
Spoken like someone who has never fought an offensive sov war/eviction
---
You're still thinking like a Goon Vert.
---
Yeah, we were heavily outnumbered the bombs helped a lot
---
The real hero.
---
Going to null sec is a massive step down from fw for people who play for pvp.
---
There is an incorrect perception in eve and maybe also in CCPs thinking that following orders while sitting in a blob pressing F1 is some form of pvp - when it is not.
---
Confusingly, alliance-scale shipping, receiving, and management of fleets worth of ships is also sometimes referred to as logistics (in the expected way).
---
But yeah, the normal meaning of 'logistics' has nothing to do with being a logibro. Probably why we usually abbreviate it down to just 'logi'.
---
how many time did I warp to the wrong keepstar my super/titan...
---
check 5BTK there is a citadel highway too :D
---
I don't view that as a con.
---
I've said it many times before
---
Go back to stations and let people put up 1 per planet (or a static max of 3 to 5 per system) and make them all warpable by default (regardless of docking rights). Remove the incredibly stupid tether mechanic. If you're sitting in space, you should be in danger
---
If you wanna ****in moon mine then you can have structures for that, but you shouldn't be able to dock inside them
---
Actually a really coherent, well-thought out plan.
---
Probably 720 kick spin
---
Yes.
---
You should have listened. Now it's too late. RonPaul.jpg
---
It is ... *be convinced*
---
I disagree, I have my own sexy spreadsheet. Input scan data - output list of valuable moons; list of all moons by real value etc
---
I am thinking to play this game because I have heard that it has a good economy. Do you agree? Why/why not?
---
Sounds like American politics, no matter the party affiliation.
---
The skill injectors are a way for them to get money from free accounts. They aren't needed in any way. As a side note Eve is a sandbox game, while there are missions and stuff you can do but you're meant to make your own entertainment, usually in 0.0 the entire hisec area of the game is essentially an extension of the tutorial.
---
These have been here for a few weeks, it's pretty cool. Not at all practical, but pretty cool non-the-less.
---
Lol
---
I believe the term is instant gratification addict. Wormholers never take the long view.
---
100% agree
---
Should be some small/medium things to engage over where a 5 man fleet or a 20man tops fleet goes to fight for it. Something spread a bit for changing up tactics
---
We don't really care either, tbh
---
I'll take 2, I'm hungry :(
---
I’m not a wormholer, nor have I ever been. I challenge you to find a wormhole that looks like that. 
---
We have a load in storage for other uses I'm sure. Then again we simply tend to use Keepstars for deployments these days so....
---
Space Cleric. Paladins can smite :)
---
Technically they are all ours as we dropped them in Dekline back in the day, GoTG just took over the rent of the investments when we moved away for a better job. Now we just call them back, put them on a truck and relocated them. You know...like those trucks shipping half a house on the interstate you see on occassion.
---
Rip, it was PL who got the most 2016
---
Only problem with this is all the fun content is locked behind about a year worth of training. It’s a major issue imo
---
But if you put the structure on timerboard and let B0t Leadership know they will save it right???? Wrong!

CCP have never made a mistake. Buy PLEX from CCP. Subscribe your accounts with their 1 year deal!! )
---
you're allowed to say fucking here sweetie
---
Nah being logi in a big fleet or being triage carrier is way more fun than being an F1 Monkey. 
---
amazing. 
---
Sort the left-most column in your overview. The gates appear at the top. yw
---
weird hat 2019
---
have you even seen goons, i'm fairly sure they can afford to set up better than a faction fort for deployments. faction forts only exist for epeen anyway lmao
---
They already announce something like that a time ago, it was citadel cheaper with less timer used to be throw around as outpost in hostile territory 
---
There’s a corn kernel of truth buried somewhere in this heap of shit. 
---
Wow ok nice contribution
---
I don't get it either, it's really stupid that there is skills that give more pwg and cpu. It's a mandatory requirement and has been for year for everyone. Same thing as shield and armor resistance profiles.
---
when was the last time you were relevant in anything
---
A two year wait? Lol, mate, just because you can't fly all the ships without credit card warrioring in the first couple of days of playing doesn't mean it's a broken aspect of the game. You can feasibly/reasonably fly almost all subcaps(t1) in under a month, albeit not great but that's a possibility. If you're curious about flying the big ships then whip out the cc, but some injectors or accounts and go at it.
---
horde awoxing is just goon bluefucking and they never even notice
---
I think I may be getting confused here, causal version that I have to fill with a number?
---
This sounds like you are talking about 'paint by numbers'?
---
YES!! 1k up votes first time ever, thank you everyone!!!  
---
It's silly I know but these little things make all the difference, and I would say even more so to an artist!
---
Ya I agree with you and that is not really what I am saying. For example I started my first 10million sp on all amarr ships and beam and armor skills. Now I have a toon that is basically worthless in every aspect of the game compared to other skill sets. So you grab the cc and start injecting to get your self to teir 2 of some other skills but that quickly put you into a 80 -90 day wait to finish the skills to get you back to the point of your other skill set as a vet player. Just seems off then after 160$ worth of injectors you are still just a shit pilot in and other skills, and now injectors do even less for the same cost. 
---
Almost verbatim what I said 
---
Rorquals?
---
And that you get fuck all for killing them (in k-space). Asset safety was a mistake.
---
Yeah there’s arguably quite a few of those in EVE. Another good example: smartbombs. They are neither smart, nor do they fit very well under a loose definition of bomb. 
---
&gt; Why don’t they change the skill system to be better for new players.
---
Even more? Just remove the skill system entirely, then.
---
rape caging 93PI would of helped
---
Very awesome!!!
---
I kind of accidentally jumped from hisec straight to JSpace and skipped literally all the steps in between so anyway Let's talk industry.
---
Mining in wormholes is mostly limited to moon mining, and because reasons you can't get any good moon goo in JSpace. And because Rorquals are too big to fit through most wormholes, you see a lot more fleets of ventures and mining barges. While Ore Anomalies do spawn, they're not as big as you get in nullsec with IHubs; and Ice belts only spawn in very specific 'Shattered' wormhole systems (systems whose 6-digit system names start in 'J0'), which also cannot have structures anchored in them.
---
JSpace Gas (Fullerite) is often better than KSpace Gas, however it has a completely different purpose which I'll get to later. (Also, about 20 minutes after arriving at a site for the first time, a few Sleepers spawn, so watch yourself and have a combat ship on standby and always scout with an Astero or a Covert Ops frigate first.)
---
Ratting is still a thing, although you probably need more than a 100MN VNI, carriers aren't all that popular, and supercarriers and titans don't exist. Ratting in low-class JSpace you can do in a Gila, ratting in mid-class JSpace is commonly done with spidertanked Nestors or Rattlesnakes (bring a friend/alt), and in the high-class systems the bigger groups sometimes rat in Naglfars. In stead of getting ticks, the Sleeper rats drop these items (we call 'em Blue Loot) which you sell to NPC station buyers. (Amarr's a good place to sell them.) And upper class JSpace ratting pulls in basically all of the money. Sleeper wrecks do not drop items or modules, but they always have blue loot (and it's always consistent), and they can be salvaged. The sleepers themselves bring a combination of omni damage, long range, high speed, webs, warp disruption, and energy neutralizers; which is why a VNI is probably insufficient (you can't just outrun/dodge all the damage, you need to facetank.)
---
Except in a Wolf-Rayet system, especially a C13, where Confessors are just god.
---
Because we can't get any good moon goo, T2 production isn't really a thing in wormholes; however in stead, if you combine the Salvage from salvaging Sleeper wrecks with the Fullerite Gas I mentioned earlier (and some things from the Sleeper Data/Relic sites), you can build T3 ships (Tactical Destroyers and Strategic Cruisers). And that's the big industial sell of JSpace. 
---
Ratting and industry are generally side-things though, AFAIK there aren't really big time PVE WH corps because we all really use the ratting to pay for more combat ships to throw at ~~each other~~ random T1 exploration frigates that wander through.

As far as wormhole space itself goes, here's a TLDR:
---
* Always own an Astero. Preferably more than one. Maybe also a T2 Covert Ops frigate. And when you're not flying in one, always have Core Scanner Probes and a Scan Probe Launcher (on you, or on someone in your fleet). Maybe even have a Mobile Depot to refit on the fly if you don't have the High slots.
---
* Local Chat doesn't exist. Directional Scan (DScan) is your life. Which hilariously enough means that I feel *safer* flying in JSpace than anywhere in KSpace.
---
* **EVERYONE** is NPSI / Kill On Sight. Except for Signal Cartel.
---
* If you see Combat Scanner Probes, warp. immediately. anywhere. If you see a Sabre it's already too late.
---
* Bookmarks are your second life after DScan.
---
* Sleepers kinda hurt.
---
* Use something like Tripwire, Pathfinder, Siggy, whatever of those your corp/alliance uses. Trying to map wormhole chains in your head is suicide.
---
* Titans and Supers don't exist. Period. Cynos also don't exist. There are no umbrellas to save you, or your enemy. 
---
* However... if you're in voice comms with your fleetmates, they just might come save you and then thank you for being the bait and finding them Content^(TM)

There are a few other wormhole groups who have already sounded off in this thread (MKAV, Stranger Danger, Wormhole Society) as open. I'm with Natural Phenomenon now; we're basically a bloodthirsty frat house in space and if you want to join us in the murderbrawling we do generate a lot of murderbrawling.
---
no poors man...come on
---
This would effect mining fleets too. This would effect the structures that the big alliances use to hold sov.
---
The smaller region alliances would then have more opportunity to split, to betray or to not log on.
---
I see you are admiring my work. You’re welcome. 
---
:(
---
I'll take 2 but squish all 8 paks on them
---
The only structures we could safely deploy for the move were asshouses. You don't think you could have just dropped on that and murder anyone who bounced? Even if you didn't kill all of them, or even if you didn't kill most of them, you would have scared us enough to keep put.
---
We also had a sharply limited number of ways to exit. You didn't even try to contest those structures, either. I know; I personally dropped all of them.
---
Yeah they should make it more like WoW where I got all the set armor I wanted just for the asking and didn't have to set one foot in a raid dungeon. I can't believe people actually do those things and take all this time making their characters look all cool and shit.
---
It's not going to work.
---
Naw I agree that is silly to I do t think it should be easy. The content of this game is created by the players and without a reason for new players to play there is no content. 
---
CCP: No. The game is fine as is.
---
Shoot refineries with reaction services and engineering complexes. Boom, loot. We have individual structures in 1DQ1-A with trillions being cycled through them on any given day, all ready to be shot and looted. Granted, those are probably pretty tough targets.
---
it's the process of assessment and prioritizing care delivery based on need - nothing more
---
Santo Trafficante...now that's a name I've not heard in a long time. 
---
Thank God. 
---
You’re.
---
Traitor.

HashtagDelveProblems
---
TBH Fam, Guardians of the Dumpster (Which periodically catches fire) has always been more accurate in my opinion.
---
Yeah like is flying through the clouds of some distant Gas Giant. I mean technically if these ships have warp drive why not anti-gravity and other extreme capabilities.
---
What’s this have to do with anything? Lol 
---
looks pretty normal nullsec where people fly rorqs before ever participating in pvp and betting bored when people in assault frigs dont 1v1 their super so they buy blingy shits that they have no clue on how to fly
---
And this is why I choose STK friends over pixels!
---
Your two years claim is bullshit
---
And CCP has improved the sp system for new players. Not that long ago you started with \~50k sp, now you start with \~350k sp.
---
I mean yes. Getting majority of skills to V is a headache. Aim for 4s then progress the low tier skills fast like frigates/small guns/rockets etc then when the feel of your favorite kind of ship comes around train specifically into that. Should be a few months vs year. 
---
I agree that EVE has a good economy. This is because almost every item is built and sold by the players, and because pricing and availability are the result of free market competition with minimal intervention by the developer.
---
I see, thank u very much!
---
That makes holding sov a fucking chore.
---
I hate it when Space Monkeys are right.
---
link yours. 
---
Indeed, but you're looking at it all skewed. The fullness of skills takes time, but you can have a combat viable character in about 8 hours. It's been that way for many many years, injectors are relatively new the Eve and not well looked upon by a lot of veteran players.
---
That just sounds like incursions with extra steps
---
*except with the clever use of game mechanics and fitting burst jammers https://zkillboard.com/kill/55403284/ 
---
I suggest you explore other aspects of the game. You cannot mine everything and everywhere... safely.
---
This game is not just a mining game. No matter how hard the developers are trying.
---
There's a difference between salty and mocking.

All my info is in my post history brother

Couldn't they be anchored in the shape of something? 
---
Perhaps a giant Mittani, waving a shepherds crook at a sprawling field of pets?
---
Fair point but combat ready is much different than comestible against fully skilled tier 3 rigs 
---
I don't play EvE nor play to as I don't wanna be committed like that. However, I would love to know about the stories that come out of it (the wars, the betrayals, the upsets etc) but don't know where to look.
---
Does anyone know about something like this?
---
Rorquals literally have an anti-small gang mechanic.. what are you smoking lmao.
---
So as a software engineer you should understand how using Patterns (like a facorty method) would make creating his idea of raiding parties with descrete interaction profiles doable. Additionally, games such as Rift have done things similar to what OP is proposing so it is certainly viable if CCP didn't have terrible legacy code that seems not to be designed in any kind of modular architecture.
---
That being said, OP's idea will never happen for a must simpler reason that the technical viability. CCP would never do anything that would drastically effect their main revanue stream. 
---
how come?
---
1) Mobile cyno inhibition rework so those Rorquals/carriers etc are engagable again.
---
2) Take fighters back to the DPS/speed/tracking/application/targeting capabilities of carrier drones/super fighters before the citadel patch. Improved server performance and controllable fighters with abilities are all fine. But nobody was asking for a carrier buff before/during the citadel patch.
---
3) Address gate bosoning and gatecamping with supers (ties back to point 2). Capitals shouldn't be gatecamping ships.
---
4) Further anom rework so 1 region feeds only about 1/15 of entire null's population (approx 10k accounts, as opposed to 50k accounts).
---
5) Null statics for C6 or C7 wormholes with NS statics that can support multiple dreads. More consistent interaction points between wormholers and nullseccers that doesn't require living in a C2 and giving up capitals.
---
Or you can earn enough ISK fairly early on to start injecting, the answer doesn’t have to be real money. 
---
And you could have spent your first 10 mil SP better than you did, no one else to blame but yourself for so heavily specialising. 
---
&gt; fc: fleet take warp
---
&gt; me: &gt;:(
---
&gt; fc: WHO WASN'T ALIGNED 
---
Lol sounds like you haven't written a line of professional code in your life and are just banking off your design patterns class 
---
Depending on the ship and the fit a cap booster is a better midslot item than anything else. Only 1 mod for your cap needs. You can use the extra lows for range/tracking or damage. Rigs could be tripple rigor id your in a raven for example, making shooting smaller things easier.
---
You mean POS ?
---
Oh wait...
