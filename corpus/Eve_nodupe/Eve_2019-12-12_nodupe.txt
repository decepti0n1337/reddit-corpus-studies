it has to  be fun for you

---
for the others who gives a shit
---
---
---
Do you know the way?
---
Good points!
---
open sphere? engage h4x? I can't remember how it goes xD
---
You add siege module and 10 minute spool up on that DD, i.e. now fax support for Titan while it spools up, then things get spicier. 
---
Now the biggest blob would just snipe keepstars of literally anyone.
---
This is alot of semi good ideas with extremely horrible ones.
---
Looks like a concern-troll post on deeper analysis. Major buff to whoever is biggest (Goons).

CCP in their infinite wisdom, added dangerous npcs to the game, but put them in an overview-group that is not shown by default.
---
Mining was never safe, but they're easily killed with some drones or evaded. (but then youll need a proper overview).
---
Try loading up an overview pack that has some sensible defaults; I personally quite like the AEGIS overview pack. Join ingame channel "AEGIS Settings" for links to loading it.
---
This Way.
---
CCP can migrated the tools people like / need into the game.
---
I sent an email to the UK Gambling Commission to ask whether the ability to RMT your ISK through secondary markets makes this legally gambling or not.
---
You have reached status: Bittervet
---
Battleships are pretty terrible now, too slow, too bombable, too easily killed by supers and titans. There's really very little reason to fly one which is why everyone uses HACs.
---
I'd prefer that but my feeling is it's an absolute non-starter for CCP.
---
So you are saying you'd pay 50m for a 1/512 chance to win something worth 200m because you have a chance at winning and coming out ahead?

1. Has been tried by games and failed, limiting engagement sizes doesn't work, especially in a sandbox. You alienate too many players, and the system gets gamed. Imagine a squad of spies getting in on a limited engagement and flipping...
---
2. Its a sandbox, the players make the goals not ccp.
---
im  going  for  hybrid  for now. once i get enough level i ll try others.
---
great program. thanks!
---
i didn't think about it, I'll try it. thanks!
---
it's what he's doing but relative to the price of the ticket. V/N/t instead of V/N - t  . the effective price is Nt, the market value is V.
---
&gt;but I just got some extra money for my birthday
---
doesn't sound like stable, taxable, income...
---
hey jared welcome back to eve! heavens know the game needs motivated people like you. fly safe o7
---
Inhibs to 500k would make actual stop bubbles matter since caps can't teleport onto the dying rorqual to instantly save it because they used a single cyno.
---
If you roll into Horde, test, or goons, why do you roll the hole? There's great content killing fighters and farming the response. You know you can't kill the rorq but provoking a response is fun.
---
The irony is that, from my perspective (someone who's moved to only playing subcaps), BS are probably the best they've been since the nanonerf. Since then, they got:
---
-tiericide
---
-MJDs
---
-halved MWD cap consumption
---
-cargohold buffed
---
-grapplers
---
-3200s
---
And, despite all this, they're complete garbage at the strategic level. Just demonstrates the oppressive power creep of capitals and supercapitals in the past few years.
---
I find that when that happens it's the result of some engineer that did something smart I'm terms of architecture way back when.
---
I actually drive a motorcycle now, I can't afford car insurance. 
---
My motorcycle insurance is more than some people's car insurances though. :P
---
Let Capitals (excluding supercaps) jump to the 0km spot on any sun regardless of cynojammers!
---
Depending on how sadistic the designer is feeling they could make them land right around 0 on the sun like the worlds ~~worst~~ best Cyno Beacon, a random on-grid spot 500km away or a 1AU off-grid.
---
Every thirty days all corps get disbanded and your in game name gets randomized.
---
Shit don't give the government ideas man.
---
This game doesn't need super balance changes. It needs player #s to be balanced in fights.
---
If you can just slam your N+1 dick in someone's face any time you want, it doesn't matter what you do with the actual game's balance, since it's already being thrown away by unequal player numbers.
---
I've said this for years and everyone always thinks I'm joking, but honestly, what about the game would be *worse* if they simply deleted supercapitals with 100% reprocess and refunded the SP? I mean, thousands of brainless F1 monkeys would quit, and the game probably wouldn't survive that, but in terms of the actual metagame... I think it would vastly improve.
---
plus one, oh seven. 
---
delete all capitals
---
The minimum range to increase the inhib to Olmeca is suggesting is predicate on it not being 1-shot by a long range Titan, which is the current favoured removal solution. 
---
A viable alternative might be changing it to have a tiny sig and a much bigger (and more repairable) buffer. Or possibly creating a module version on a t2 bc hull.
---
You completely ignored my question, to complain about how I chose to ask the question.
---
Also you're wrong. :p
---
Glad to be back! I've missed this game, I tried dabbling in exploration but I've only had one successful run. ðŸ˜‚

---
Good to see Eve's death finally picking up pace. Thanks Pearl Abyss!
---
Anchoring a structure in a hole while solo means you can't provide fights. Not providing fights in WH space is how you get seeded/evicted. Hole Bushido and all.
---
I need to look at it more. My pie chart is borderline useless.
---
Possibly, though the OCR feature I'm thinking of using is much more geared towards recognizing the screen in real-time.
---
That...and I was thinking some kind of fuel/material cost (... launching/recovery?) to make sure any kind of portable docking games have an ongoing cost.
---
Definitely the way.
---
You can still make the market as a tab that blinks.
---
You can still have wallet settings. 
---
But ya, complain on reddit first, search later :)
---
So I recently spent a couple of months doing work with a company that employs a lot of visually impaired people. I'm curious what apps you're using.
---
What I know of most VI computer aids is they rely on text rather than OCR, so getting something working for Eve would be tricky. Not that it can't be done, but you're definitely in for some challenges. One thing I'd definitely suggest is looking to the log files that are generated as a way to get some of the information you need in an audible format.
---
Ship fitting is very visual and will be a challenge for you. Saved fits will help, but some quirks in the client like grouped guns randomly landing on different slots will make it an ongoing concern for you.
---
Eppstein didnt killed himself.
---
actually i thought this was how carriers / supercarriers worked, back when I started looking at them for the first time.
---
My set up is actually quite simple, there is a screen reader  called NVDA, which has a built-in support for OCR thanks to Windows 10. I work in the accessibility field professionally, so I am well aware  of how challenging this is probably going to be. :-) Nevertheless, I have a few add-ons which may help the process more than people might expect, depending on how easy it is to keep certain parts of the interface in consistent locations.ï¿¼
---
good stuff my man i would just compare with the estimated price given and only bid if it was lower this will help me out
---
A thousand titans?
---
f
---
What happens if i dock in your super, and want to undock while you are logged off?
---
You are spending normal amount of time in character creation screen compared to people without obvious disabilities. Good luck.
---
Yep, and his dad and sister.
---
Fighters do have limited ammo for their missiles and such already and have to redock to rearm.
---
What will you do when Evan Mclean finds a way into Thera? Will it be the end for V0lta as we know it?
---
Well, there actually IS a part that makes sense to invest from a buyers perspective:
---
Very rare items, with unclear pricing (raven state issue, god-like abyssal mods etc)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
For everything else, it's a gamble with bad odds and usually unliquid prices
---
So... 5 flights of heavy fighters?
---
Even if not I find myself in agreement with a goon, what a strange world we live in today.
---
im not fully aware of that story, what happened there?
---
&gt;Gambling is supposed to be fun and entertaining.
---
What gambling are you talking about? Yoi didn't gamble 20-30 bil you used anither  avenue in which you can exercise your freedom in trade, while engaging in an entertaining and social activity at the same time. 
---
CCP said so
---
Thanks for the clarification.
---
it looks the garmur is actually helping you anyway  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/80371365/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/80371365/)
---
Dreads need a retool:  they should get a bonus to dmg vs citadels supers and titans.  I mean they are suppose to be capital ship killers a 10-25% bonus would change things up...it would increase kills when response fleets drop for those trying to dread bomb.
---
Paid for by hisec pubbies
---
The only assumption is that you see profit over a number of raffles when playing based on Expected Value. I can't guarantee you a certain outcome on a single game unless as you say you already made your money back and don't care about losing the item.
---
That's how most casinos make their money not by failing each individual customer until they pay enough for the casino to be profitable but by stacking the odds of the entire system against all customers by a small percentage.
---
It's a fucking scam you dimwit, it should be labeled as such. A 50%+ markup preys on people being either oblivious to the actual odds or simply addicted to gambling and therefore not caring about being ripped off because they are chasing a thrill and not the actual price itself.
---
It's the new Jita scam. Casino/traditional gambling is also a scam but a scam that also comes with social interactions and a thrill. Hypernet doesn't and will die off real fast when novelty wears off and sellers start losing money when the raffle doesn't fill up because they got blocked 90% of the playerbase because of their local jita spam. It will be limited to super expensive ships/module and original BP that actually warrant such a high price that they are painful to sell on the regular market and even then markup will be close to null if not negative. But now Jita lowlife scammers all think they can forever cash in on this and they buy tons of nodes and suddenly they will be stuck with a overinflated supply of worthless nodes bought with plex after most of their raffles don't fill up and they just lose money and CCP will be laughing to the bank with a succesful quick cash grab.
---
Solve the issue by eliminating alliances that get too big. It's like corporate America. Once you get some at that size they won't go away and you have no chance against them. With or without supers, titans, or anything nerfs. It will just become "now this needs nerf"
---
Oof ouch owie. 102% =\= 2%. Satire or not?
---
Your high insurance premiums make me think that you're either going to be crashing that Iteron, or speeding in it.
---
Good to see you back in business o7
---
ITT: People who can't read
---
&gt; else you'd be able to boosh enemy ships to the other side of new eden
---
I mean....
---
That sounds fucking hilarious and I actually wish it were possible
---
I cant wait to find out its not your fleet but some kind of boosh where you and 24 other objects just fucking YEET across the map, bringing whatever hostiles (cloaked or not) are on grid with you at the time. 
---
The standing fleet awox filaments will be amazing.
---
Well Iâ€™m super disappointed with that. Itâ€™s like losing your Captain/Quarterback.
---
I wish him and his weird family all the best though. Heâ€™ll do well wherever he goes.
---
I mean at that point is killing another ship in eve an act of vandalism since that ship was worth real money and someone destroyed my property?
---
Yes.
---
Anyone else being bothered that they went with
---
&gt;CMT-05 Filament  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;PRNCR-03 Filament  
---
&gt;etc.
---
instead of
---
&gt;COMET-05 Filament

&gt;ect.

I mean, I get that vowels are evil, but those names are all over the place

Yes! I dont even know how we could live without this. The time before this change can be called the dark ages.

Yes but did you know the Moros also has a face?

Because then the people with the biggest industry (goons) win eve forever with no counter

Are these EC-300 still worthy ? I thought ECM sucks after the changes.
---
Corvettes are free.
---
You'd be better doing L4 missions if you purely wanted profit wouldn't you? I haven't tried the conduits so not sure how interesting they are in case you were trying to maximise your fun/hour
---
Yes you are.
---
Happy cakeday
---
Or alternatively, get your friends in fleet. Get a hisec pubbie in an expensive ship into fleet, warp fleet to him, yeet into null and kill him.
---
This is a video game.  Now it's a video game with gambling.  As if CCP give a shit about the "moderation" of their profits.
---
Fucking prick.
---
YEET
---
For emerging or minor conduit? If emergent, why not just use a rattle? If minor, No. You need a buffer tank and a Nestor on the grid.
---
That's super expensive, you can run them in a 300milish praxis just fine.
---
It's been a while since I played, but I'm pretty sure that both the self-destruct and disband buttons still work.

Ok Boomer.

jesus fucking christ is there anything left in this world that's not gonna inevitably offend one retard or another. it's the god damn internet and space video games, grow some fucking skin or unplug and go outside but stop with this fucking garbage

I know you are a recovering Heroin addict and opted out of the new "Shooting Up" marketplace update because of it but we are giving out free hits as part of the daily login reward.
---
You dont need to use it. You can sell it to someone or destroy it.
---
They don't affect you because none of them cares about you. If anyone brings enough titans to kill your structure in a single volley you wouldn't be able to defend it anyways.
---
Imperial Legacy is everything BoB ever wanted to be.

VOTE MATISUGA! Make Titans and Supers Great Again.
---
The hupernet as a platform and the UI promotes you to bet on stuff, if you loose it suggests you 3 new raffles with the same item. Its made to keep you going.
---
Itâ€™s still obnoxious and tedious to have to go to high security space. Itâ€™s dangerous there!
---
I don't know what's funnier, your blatant edit to try and cover the obvious counter-argument or the fact that it didn't succeed.
---
Is joke. Like your face.
---
TBH if you think a game mechanic is similar to heroin then that says a lot more about you than it does anyone else.

Kind of looks like a blobfish [https://untamedscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/blobfish1.jpg](https://untamedscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/blobfish1.jpg)
---
Don't forget far. Oh so far.
---
The best thing you can do is contract the Hypernet cores to me. Since I don't intend to do raffles ever, this will remove them from the system.
---
I will even contract you a piece of carbon back.
---
Maybe we shouldn't downgrade everyone's experience to cater to a tiny minority that can easily just sell these junk items if they're really committed to avoiding addiction.
---
Yup. My thoughts exactly.
---
Arr
---
You gamble ISK on the chance to win items listed by other players.
---
As we're all already aware, the game allows for the purchasing of ISK using real cash.
---
CCP (AKA Pearl Abyss) is banking of the ever reliable draw of gambling addiction to squeeze real money out of gambling addicts that buy PLEX to fund their in-game habit.
---
Draw your own moral conclusions.
---
&gt; For shame!
---
Ok Greta Thunberg.
---
It's raffles.
---
Raffles make money.
---
Maybe you can have a friend help you out with it, else just hit random a couple of times and go with it. The outfit and all indeed doesn't matter much.
---
Or they just want to offer it to normal people.
---
or they enjoy the fun of the raffles
---
Miners, ratters, incursion runners in highsec ... here we come :D
---
idk man, in Korea it says it's for players 18 and older.
---
...It's a material difference.
---
Neither good or bad.
---
When I last played Eve there was a raffle based site you could spend isk on. It got shut down and the playerbase were upset. Now raffle has come back, the same player base is also upset. What's happened in the last few years? Or is it just because it's CCP ran?
---
Just did a quick test and it seems people in fleet and within 6km need to have partial safety, otherwise the filament doesn't work.
---
The 10 hyper cores only let you set up offers.
---
Using them isn't gambling...
---
Except it gets them in to use it on the winning side, not he losing gambling side.
---
Amen
---
How about we call it **"Ansiblex infractructure distruption system"** - or in short: **AIDS*

What is the difference?

Is there a mass limit to these or can my Chimera roam dream come true?

Should have welcomed him to Tranq by destroying his Venture and then not podding him.
---
How much $ exchanged?
---
nor is playing the lottery.
---
only creating a lottery is monetized.
---
\&gt; What's the benefit and why would I want to use it rather than selling my stuff at jita? 
---
Easy, you can make more money through Hypernet. You see at Jita, you sell a 1 billion ISK item for 1 billion ISK. Someone buys it, that's it.
---
On Hypernet, you can sell TICKETS to WIN your 1 billion ISK item for 1 million ISK each. But you can sell 2,000 tickets. meaning you earn 2 billion ISK when all is said and done. Barring fees and taxes, of course.
---
The "think about Eve Online's gambling addicts!" argument is *very weird*
---
asset safety lmao
---
Thanks, really wish CCP had just included the cost in the raffle, I've been sitting here with a calculator doing it by hand.
---
Asking the real questions...
---
you want to sell him the ingame infos as a reliable source of information?
---
So alcoholism isn't a social problem which needs addressing or talking about?
---
Hell yeah dude.
---
Nope lol, you're still forced to use Genolution Set since CCP can't be bothered with Shield Slaves ffs. Those Implants give you hugeass boni to Capacitor as well as your two other Capacitor Implants in a Shield Superclone and Caldari Navy Power Diagnostics, if you can manage to drop a Nestor.
---
You regen 120GJ/s and your Hardeners only drain 40GJ once every 12sec ...
---
Sure you'll be sucked dry but there is allways enough juice left to get your Hardeners online especially if you get dropped by Dreads and not Bombers! Capital Neuts fcking suck with their huge cycletime!
---
False dichotomy. Nice try.
---
CCP's somerblink RMT
---
I do have a freighter, I didn't have a lot of isk, I spent most on skill injectors to be able to use the freighter and dsts and stuff.
---
I am not going to use the freighter unless it's highsec only and close, I think I need a webber or something for it if I remember correctly.

maybe im misunderstanding asset safety, but dont you have to be able to dock somewhere to trigger asset safety?

---
I'm not saying he's wrong. I'm saying his point is unrelated to the conversation. It's talking past the main issue, and so do you.
---
Nobody argues people live like hermits, or all Eve players should play solo. The argument here is that there are mechanics in real world that act as obstacles, diminishing returns or upper limits preventing human organizations from growing larger and larger throughout the history. And there can be similar mechanics in Eve. And thus the human nature point is irrelevant if Eve can imitate those mechanics. If there are no such mechanics (as in the status quo), of course organizations will tend get to blobbier and blobbier.
---
'Mental health problems' - it's called lack of self-control. No different to fat fucks eating their way into mobility scooters. The only sickness here is retards like you excusing such behaviour and pussyfooting around it.

Yeah join Boss

Probably not. Especially since you've probably had him in an NPC corp for the last decade, which is a sure sign of an inactive account.

I'll add to this that people will assume the 2006 character has ~120m sp even if it's killboard is devoid of activity.

Krabs spinning the narrative on reddit, nothing new to see.

Filament gives you easy access to nullsec to search for pvp content. This doesn't mean that you find "instnat gratification" or some other bullshit, there's high chance you'll end up bumfuck nowhere and will still have to burn many jumps which is all right, but its still pretty good. I like it
---
It usually takes from about an hour to potato
---
Send Venture from High-sec to Null-sec!
---
Well he just joined that group so he doesn't appear to be salty about it at all anymore.  Good thing you still remember it though, stuff like that always used to inflate my ego when random nobodies still jerked off about one of my losses years later.

Happy for you mate. But then that's how randomness works. Sometimes you get a lucky roll.

The proper targets are mission marauders and shit belonging to 2016 characters who don't have a single lossmail outside of highsec.
---
Gambling
---
They still will, it's just that there are so many more items up on hypernet now.
---
&gt;Goons had dominance between B-R5RB and WWB, that was about 2 years.
---
We definitely didn't. I was in the FC rooms at the time and we never felt like we had it. Maybe you feel like we did but we felt like we didn't.
---
Just to be clear, I don't have a strong opinion on the hyper net one way or the other. But I can totally see someone with an addiction getting into their credit cards to buy PLEX to buy ISK to bet on raffles. It's not that much of a leap from using a slot machine in Vegas.
---
Yeah, I think it's just going to be the higher priced things like JFs and structures that will do alright. All the smaller stuff is going to just be flooded out basically.
---
If anyone has snowballs that melted on Tuesday there are now sites all throughout hisec which you'll see on your overview as **Yoiul Festival Snowball Exchange**. If you warp to one of these sites there'll be a festive looking Astrahus that you can open like a container to exchange your old, melted snowballs for fresh ones.
---
Be aware that it's a 10:1 exchange ratio though since snowballs are now part of the "economy" of the 13 Days of EVE event and we don't want to flood the market, as it were.
---
If you have a massive stockpile of melted snowballs then exchanging them that way will take a LOT of clicks though, so if you want to attend this event I'll be in the [Luminaire VII (Caldari Prime) - Moon 6 - Federation Navy Assembly Plant](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Luminaire_VII_(Caldari_Prime)_-_Moon_6_-_Federation_Navy_Assembly_Plant) station from 19:00 EVE time on Sunday before the event. If you bring your melted snowballs to that station and open a trade with me I'll take them and give you back fresh snowballs (again, at the 10:1 ratio) for you to use in the event.
---
It's not about losing ships, it's about being unable to roll the hole for a chance at more targets or even on the rare occasion an actual good fight.
---
1/512.  Those are the odds.  Not sure why that seems complicated to you.
---
The whole "good deal" thing needs to go, for sure.  This isn't a marketplace, it is a raffle house.  There are no "good deals" or deals at all.  You're not buying an item.  You're gambling.
---
Still isn't a scam
---
Make sure they didn't get melted on Tuesday! If they did [read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/e9nka9/dev_blog_luminaire_snowball_fight_vi/fal08kj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).
---
But if supers are heavy fighters only, and titans have no bosons or haw guns that big ball of supers now has very limited sub cap fighting potential.  I dont know if his idea is perfect but it seems like it pulls some power ot of the dominance of super fleets
---
Again. Addict. It means you are always tempted to use it even if you dont want to.
---
which will force people to list them for more reasonable prices, i see no issue here.
---
Does everyone reach the same system like a free bridge or does everyone just get farted out into random systems individually?
---
So beautiful. So brave. /s
---
If they're that prone to taking risks I would suggest that their entire EvE career has not been a good time for them. If they're so willing, now, to pull out their credit card to buy plex to convert to ISK whats been stopping them in the past from trying to take advantage of various "get rich quick ideas" in the game?
---
Eh fuck them. If they have an addiction they should be going to group or some shit. If they are dumb enough to ruin their lives let them.
---
there is various types of them. they range from 5 fleet members to 25
---
you shud not be able to buy your own raffle tickets, hes pretty much guaranteed to win the thing w/ 80% of the tickets
---
Hi dude,
---
I'm a 15 year Eve veteran. If you ever need any help answering questions, or guidance, or just some company to play with, let me know. I operate in highsec. 
---
All the best
---
Why not a capital sized black ops that gives bonuses to bombers?  or bomb launching fighters?
---
With your mum? Sounds about right
---
I for one, Won't Stop Believing
---
I hate PL way way way more than I hate Goons, so I'm actually OK with how things are right now. 
---
Lots of tears from elite PvP now they've lost supercap dominance, so it's all good. Also *epic* amounts of historical revisionism for those of us who remember not only Welpcanes by also *why* Welpcanes were a thing.
---
Post glassing Tribute, there's free space for small alliances to be.
---
Game's not in too bad a state, unless you're really, really salty about groups winning that encourage new players and allow carebears to exist as long as they get in fleets when needed. It's way better than the NCPL model of "Rents due on the fifteenth of the month".
---
Like, bro.. you've taken three swings and have yet to throw anything above a middle school level slam. Step it the fuck up or get off reddit. This ain't the small times, slick.
---
oh it's 150 remaining not 150 purchased.
---
yeah so he's going to have to sell that at a 500% markup.
---
why would you buy a ticket even if he didn't buy any tickets himself?
---
yikes
---
I'm with you on most of that. I honestly am not dissatisfied with the current state of the game. It's hella-easier for new players to get into the game and get into battles, which should be the ideal we all want. More people generally means more content, and it prevents this game from being shut down.
---
Well, Iâ€™m not making light of someoneâ€™s addiction, it cannot be an easy thing to have to deal with.
---
However, and I donâ€™t mean to sound crass, that onus is on OP. They need to seek the help they need, and Iâ€™m fully supportive of all such efforts. However, weâ€™re living in the real world, and itâ€™s not a bouncy castle where you never get hurt.
---
I can see where people canâ€™t resist alcohol, and thatâ€™s a real problem too. But youâ€™re not closing all the bars because of that demographic. I have a lot of sympathy for people with an addiction profile, at the same time you canâ€™t take away all triggers everywhere, thatâ€™s not going to make for a fun life.

I havenâ€™t seen the mechanic yet myself. This is the kind of thing I will definitely want to give a try to see how it works. In life I have been blessed by the fact that I never win anything, so Iâ€™m often not even going to be tempted to try. On those occasions where I do engage I do so in the full knowledge that the house always wins and that the numbers are stacked against me. Iâ€™m not a charitable guy in that respect that Iâ€™m not going give all my money to some guy *cough*Erotica 1*cough* in the vague and poorly defined expectation that theyâ€™re going to make me rich.
---
By your definition the entire Jita local channel should be shut down because scamming and gambling is the only thing that happens there.
---
To reiterate: I understand and sympathise with OPs gambling problem, for which they should get all the help they need, at the same time just because this mechanic is now there does not mean they have to engage with it and, Iâ€™ll keep saying it: just because they have that particular problem doesnâ€™t mean everybody else has that problem and they should abstain [Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s a great thing to have in the game, Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s going to be something fucked about it, or else I donâ€™t know CCP well enough but who am I kidding, Iâ€™ve been driving this thing for over a decade].

Yes, like playing video games. Eating dessert, watching movies.
---
Right?
---
&gt;This doesn't mean that you find "instnat gratification" or some other bullshit
---
&gt;Tbh wouldâ€™ve been better if it just dumped you on the head of some ratter/miner
---
might not be what you're getting, but that's clearly what people want.
---
so much for spin...
---
Iâ€™m also personally a fan of [lasker Emanuel](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UC5F3RCReOweuoBYQlV3OIPQ) (solo fights in either dreads or frigates, very cool to watch) 
---
Bjornbee, who has a twitch and a YouTube, and is hilarious
---
[Xtra squishy](https://m.youtube.com/user/XtraSquishy), who is pretty damm funny
---
Ngl I would half want this just to scare the shit out of someone doing a DED site, half way through the boss and some Loki appears right next to you
---
sounds like you never yote
---
none of those are net negatives unlike literally throwing money away.
---
No
---
Honourable? In Eve? Sounds unlikely...
---
Lokley Theo does some great solo (multiboxing)/small gang wormhole videos as well
---
can confirm i had a blast doing abyssals up there
---
A GM actually recommended I try using a VPN once... And lo and behold, it solved my issue. Waiting to get banned for it someday though xD

Dude stop it! That's the last thing we need.
---
Maybe Enyo's aren't the end-all-be-all and Tiny needs a new comp.
---
&gt; And even worse, the 10min DD suggestion means that even less Titans die in a big brawl as it is more likely a few escape.
---
OTOH a dreadbomb doesn't get instantly deleted by a wave of doomsdays, they have 10 minutes to get damage in (and then they'll get wiped out)
---
I would go with the character over the skill points. You can get more of those, you can't get back the attachment to a certain character as easily.
---
And even when the cap is there for non carriers/structures, it's 300 km not 250
---
am doing it wrong, I have no funancials :(
---
Anything you're considering putting a Rorq on, tbqh.
---
Usually R64s get them because the extra slots + EHP makes it difficult to RF them. But realistically you can put it on any moon and make it *worth* it because the active moon drill cost is the same as the athanor (as long as that's the only service you're running on it)
---
He's right tugen. We're a 1 trick corp since we didn't kill everything on the other side of a frig hole when they had more caps than we had dps ships.
---
That is the smartest comment Iâ€™ve seen in this subject all day. Well done. Weâ€™re definitely doing that.
---
Right.   I'm sure they just crammed anything they had on hand in there and sent it.   I mean they dropped 20+ caps on frig's   I can't speak to their game knowledge
---
There probably isnâ€™t anything inside a dead POS. Youâ€™d want to look for ship maintenance arrays or hangars that will drop any ship left inside. Itâ€™s extremely rare to see an offline POS anymore with intact SMAs or hangars.
---
I had the same issue to the point I lost a ship. Did some research online and found that using a VPN can fix the issue and it has for me. Does suck to have to go that route in order to play though
---
Rokhs, Small lasers, reinforced bulkheads.
---
In that order.
---
There are 3 good new players corps with the structure to help you out. Karmafleet, Brave Newbies and Pandemic Horde. Look at getting into one of those and they can help you along.
---
I was in a wormhole and tried snoballing a Sleeper. Didnâ€™t get any XP.
---
Few things come to mind...
---
- EVE has probably the oldest player base of any video game I know.
---
- There are a lot of newbie friendly corporations.  I'm sure people will be here shortly to plug whichever one they're in.
---
- No matter what, you'll need to be ready and willing to learn.  There's a lot to take in.
---
Based on what though.  Do you limit items on contracts or market?  I mean maybe skill based so an upper limit per character
---
Exactly
---
The game doesnâ€™t count it as an aggressive act so no countdown timers and no concord aggro, fire away
---
I killed an NPC dread spawn on a moon last week with an Athanor. Took forever though.
---
If those corps do an API check, they will know different.
---
You do lose stuff in wormholes. All the stuff. Don't quite care about high- or null- sec whinebabies.
---
As stated earlier, how easy it is to access makes me wonder if CCP is taking advantage of people who can't spend their money right. At the end of the day it's more of a moral issue and something that would be sorted through courts, but is this even CCP making hypernet? 
---
It takes less than 10 clicks to bid on an item. I agree having a good UI is good for a feature, but not even a confirmation window? Not even some warning? They put in that much effort for Hypernet but never do anything for other features that need a better UI? ACLs could be waaaaaaay better. Structure management could also use a better UI. Yet somehow, they can easily make a good UI to make people spend more isk/plex? Maybe you don't see an issue with that, I certianly feel that CCP is simply ignoring the eleplants in the room.
---
You too can materialize more a dozen pre prepped nerds to vaporise your foes with this miraculous module i'm sure you've never heard of it called a Cynosural Field, only works outside of wh space tho.
---
I run a corp like that :) 
---
Nooot quite sure I'd be fine with having someone's structures in my home hole (though if you join, we can set up a citadel that you have rights to) but other than that, we can discuss it if you're interested.
---
I donâ€™t know why but I spent weeks with paper dolls in spaceships, even more useless than Skyrimâ€™s version
---
but ... why buy a skin that was given free ? For an ugly vexor nonetheless
---
It's a derogatory term. Krabs are players that bemoan the blue doughnut of null sec while at the same time engaging in all the risk adverse behaviors that sustain said blue donuts.
---
Fighting stupidly outnumbered is one of the most honorable things you can do in this game! Too many people get upset and quit when they see a challenge. Good to see Mcav still around kicking ass and getting good fights.
---
That's not accurate these tactics are they only type that work against goons and test right now... Check out voltas kill board last weekend they went for goons supers under the umbrella and took down 2 in the space of an hour. WH's are the leveler it dosnt matter who you are big or small 80 polarised bombers are going to wreck you and the umbrella ain't gonna save ya.
---
There's a couple week old threads on here about the same thing and I myself put in a support ticket for it. A mass support email went out to those who put in a ticket for the same issue that basically said they were having an issue with a link flapping (unstable connection cause by, in my experience, a bad or dirty cable, bad optics, or a bad port) on an edge router. They disabled that port or link and re-routed the connection which seemed to fix it for a little while then posts like yours started showing up again.
---
Put in a tech support ticket describing your problem and if you want to possibly help them out with narrowing down the issue, give them your geographic location and what ISP your using. They'll get back to you.
---
I've been trying to download the game but it's been stuck on Installing for 3 days. Every few minutes it downloads a few wine files but I can't see the progress of the download.
---
Thanks, ill do that.
---
yes
