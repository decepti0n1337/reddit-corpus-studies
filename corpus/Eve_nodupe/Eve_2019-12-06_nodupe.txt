Nice.  PB!

yeah but you gotta use polarized torp launchers
---
How times have changed :( Used to autopilot freighters round highsec, with cargo.
---
I definitely feel like frigate fights are just over a bit too quickly for me. I get that you can't really answer the question for capitals, but I did ask what everyone's general progression was.
---

---
Like for you personally, what do you like to fly? If not frigs, then what has your progression been (either in skill or taste) since you started?
---
tru
---
In other words someone's desperately trying to offload an unsellable ship
---
Will see when it gets posted :)
---
That was beautiful. 
---
PRAISE BE TO BOB!
---
Why? Give noobs a slow as shit giant capital they can't fit but can fly and they all go fucking lawnmower man at the possibilities then ragequit because they lose it immediately?
---
I have the same feelings as you towards frigate PvP - the fight is over very quickly and there is often very little player agency in the fight. A brawly frigate just orbits 500, overheats everything and then you can just alt-tab and hope you win. 
---
I've always kind of trained into doctrines that my various corps used, while following a sort of bottom-up progression, meaning I always tried to get good skills for a given ship size before moving up to the next one. If you're tired of frigates, then find an interesting-looking T1 or Faction cruiser, and start training for that. When you're done, you'll probably be close to training into some T2 hulls, and so on. 
---
As for my taste, I happen to enjoy flying whatever benefits the group the most, so I ended up in logistics 90% of the time while flying in a null bloc. In my current group, that usually means flying a links platform, such as an HFI or Drekavac, both with double skirmish, or solo logistics, or an e-war frig. Support roles like that are hugely important, but many people dislike training them, favoring bigger damage output instead.
---
Only if it involves their own people against them.

Oh man, I've never heard these and they're amazing.  Found a few more:

If I paint my skin the right color, do I get a prize too?
---
Tick tock..tick tock....all the usual shitposting ain't gonna help anymore Lordyboy.
---
I can fly anything subcap but more often than not Im in a destroyer sized ship(dictor) or even a frigate(assault frig)
---
Progression is more about mastering your favorite role rather than moving up in ship sizes.
---
i started out with t1 frigs and focused most of my sp on small ships, as it's very quick to cross-train. this has enabled me to fly tactical destroyers, assault frigates, electronic attack frigates etc., and there's still a lot of content i haven't explored there, partly due to not flying much in groups. i am still mostly in frigates thanks to ease of getting around and ability to choose engagements. now i have all small ships trained to almost full efficiency along with support skills.
---
other ships i have trained i consider more expansion than progression, as they haven't replaced my go-to ships. i'd say it's a matter of perspective, if you liked flying the worm and the overall stronger gila appeals to you, you could consider that progression. or you could be an interdictor pilot who wants to fly logi for the alliance when needed, that would be more expanding your capabilities. or your focus could keep shifting around the ship tree and you'd fly this ship for a while and then that ship. i have trained quite a lot of ships that way i still haven't touched yet, but i'm in a good position to start gaining experience in them.
---
so you put the arty nado fleet on our side and the dessie fleet that we fought you put that on our side aswell to make it look like u fought outnumbered &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3
---
No, just no...
---
What is more telling, if you look at the contributions in terms of commits they dropped off somewhat with mostly the non-native English speakers, presenting people with like 2+ pages of rules doesn't make developers go this is great.
---
What I do find particularly interesting is how the CoC is written, it seems to cover like a lot of groups but it seems to completely ignore oppression based on nationality culture of a particular nation something that is very common in the bsd project and it doesn't shock me that it's mostly non-American authors that stopped contributing over the recent years. ( judging by git commits over time )
---
Trademark that. Its brilliant.
---
I think it is reverse (correct me if I'm wrong).  100% contested means it is ready to be taken over by the rival militia.
---
lol thanks I needed the laugh.

\&gt; Depending on what hypercores actually end up costing, **each ticket will cost somewhere in the 7 billion range.**  
---
Geez, so if you go with 512 tickets at 7 billion. SISI is saying it'll require 3.7 million HyperCores with CCP taking a 179b cut (5% tax). Really feels like CCP needs to put a hard cap on the number of Cores required especially seeing that you currently can't adjust the raffle duration of 3 days--if it elapses after 3 days the seller doesn't get HyperCores refunded. 
---
If CCP doesn't adjust, it feels like the safe bet would be offer packs of 1000 HyperCores for 1 AUR each.

I had fun on both fights today! The one in 5-P and this one in G06! 
---
2 in a day - holy moly
---
It kinda was a joke. More of a diss towards titans.
---
o7 to Goons for the fight. been bitching about how dull its been feeling lately with so many blue balls.  was nice to not only get a fight but one that wasn't over in 5 minutes. 
---
lasted a good 40+ minutes   (and if you were on Horde coms, you'd have seen the pure joy in our FC's voice calling this. so nice to hear that)
---
Imperium fights outnumbered, loses less than the forces of elite pvp.
---
honorable third partying feels good man.
---
Good fight guys, was nice to shoot something other than fucking athanors :D  
---
Crazy form PH
---
wouldnt say either side was really outnumbered there.   was pretty close and both sides had more joining half way.
---
according to the numbers it was ~400 to ~380. give or take some neuts (is RR neut?)
---
amen to that
---
It's your sandbox. You can do almost anything.

This was a nice brawl, finally breaking the blueball streak
---
Its much better now. I can't go into detail, but it takes much less time. The application process is also now much more optimised and many changes have also been made to the application forms to make it less confusing. Let me tell ya, it used to be a nightmare to just put in the application.
---
agreed, i thought we were pretty well matched, really fun fight.

As with most battle reports, different links tell different stories:  [https://zkillboard.com/br/112617/](https://zkillboard.com/br/112617/) 
---
Anyway, thanks for taking the easy way home and anchoring up instead of warping off when you could've. Made it so that my plan turned into a fun fight.
---
RR isn't really that neut, they were with us. It was about 400-400 almost exactly, almost identical other than we had a larger frig fleet and you guys brought in a handful of caps. :)

I ran Sisters Arc in a Corax and decided to buy a Moa after I got some help for the Dagan fight from a dude in a Caracal. I then wasted a lot of time. Some time later I got an alt and trained into a Tengu. Never touched Battleships aside from the Praxis (I flew it around for a minute and sold it). 
---
Speaking of PvP, I have no stable source of income so I just fly Merlins and stuff.
---
The actual answer is: 
---
1. Frigate pvp is cheap, but it's too fast paced for a beginner. Cruiser pvp is a bit better, but then it also has the problem of WAY too large engagement profile (at least in FW space).
---
2. Caps and Titans are almost exclusively trained in an alt to only fly caps and Titans. Oh and you'll also need someone to light cynos.
---
3. When you have a stable corp or alliance that can support your dreaddery. Oh and stable income.
---
4. Listen to what the FC says.
---
They had 10, we killed 3.
---
Haha, ya got me in the end. Was a great fight, thanks for making the long trip worth it. I know I speak for my guys when I say we really enjoyed the fight.
---
All minds are molded easily, merely by the actions they choose to take. So then doing what is different from the rest of the cluster, helping instead of harming does not mean we are weak of mind. Merely that we think and act different way.
---
Mining generally involves getting into a Nullsec corp/alliance to breed a bunch of mining barge alts and leave them in a belt with Rorqual boosts and Juta buyback. You can also do some other wacky stuff but this is generally the most standard/ISK-effective path (ish).

I would love for them to upload the recordings of the EVE Symphony that were included in the Second Decade Edition - they're still my favorite renditions of the classic tracks, and surely everyone who purchased that bundle would be fine with it being public at this point.

hey man, being a nice person isn't a political issue. unfortunately most people in this thread don't understand how to be a decent person and can't engage in dialogue without shitslinging. this is a thread about a group of gamers who got to have a fun meetup thanks to CCP. not a thread about debating whether trump, yang, or Bernie sanders is the devil or whatever else the other idiots in this thread are trying to get into.

There are two things that actually matter:

---
* Everything else was lol ineffective, but they chose to blob against militia and failed.  Deserved mockery.
---
Will do one from tornado side, but will need some time ;)
---
Thanks for sharing thoughts on different situations.
---
As for the last part...
---
1) What Eve people were doing before discord? before skype? Hell, when it started, not everybody used even ICQ...  Was there a way to have an in-game chat which is for guild or fleet? Like in shooters you can have chat only for teammates so enemy wont read it. 
---
2) i burnt over discord(s) and now only ever visit 'em to personal message smb. I'm an old man yelling at clouds... I love funny fansites instead of soulless wikis, i prefer FORUMS (actual ones, and not piece of shit like vanillaforums or discourse, NO, gimme good phpbb/xenforo functional so you have advanced search options and great information hierarchy/structure) over degenerated mixes of chat rooms and blogs (most modern social media platforms is that)... I think i was the only one who, when visiting discord, was reading all mesages left from my last time, so i was spending a day replying to all those posts i missed.. And then, in discord u have 40 subdiscussions going on at same time, instead of separate threads like here on reddit at least, dammit).. i hate moder websites for how they loose functionality and uiux aimed at mobile-only people ...  I HATE HOW MODERN INTERNET MOSTLY ABOUT THE CURRENT MOMENT HERE  AND NOW, SO THATS WHY INSTAGRAM DOESNT HAVE ALBUMS AND ITS PAIN IN ARSE TO BROWSE OLDER PAGES ON IT OR TWITTER OR TUMBLR OR WHATEVER. AND DISCORD IS SAME DEGENERACY IN TERMS OF KEEPING INFORMATION COZ IT DOESNT HAVE STRUCTURE AND ACCESS INSTEAD YOU ARE CHATTING IN LONG ASS ENDLESS THREADS AND U CANT EVEN KNOW WHAT WAS ALREADY DISCUSSED CAUSE THERE ARE NO THREADS. 
---
oh, i went totally offtopic. Sorry :D
---
3) So you were talking about chatting with friends during "downtime" moments in EVE. 
---
I wonder.. how many eve players are NOT dedicated eve players, then? Those, who just play it once in a while. Who too busy with work/family/irl, or how mostly plays other genres, and only returns to eve from time to time.
---
Ofc but I prefer google translator as it is so ridiculous :D
---
maybe they shouldnt so this all predatory scheme gets scrapped ?
---
Trying to figure ou eve pvp on your own will be very very frustrating.
---
And goin to this sub will probably give you more confusion than guidance.
---
Most people on this sub are either bittervets that give you advice that will simply confuse you or even misguide you. Or they simply don¬¥t remember how it actually was as a new player.
---
I would suggest you join a newbie friendly corp. There you can learn pvp first hand.  
---
Also those corp¬¥s most often help you to earn ISK, have a SRP programm, free ships to start getting into pvp, fleets you can join and just listen and watch for the first times what is pvp, they help with the correct setup of the overview, teach you a little about the current meta, and so on..........  
---
Some big names of newbie friendly cops/alliances:
---
\- Pandemic Horde  
---
\- Karmafleet  
---
\- BRAVE  
---
\- EVEUNI  
---
\- TEST (Brand new bros or dreddit, i am not sure)
---

---
To be fair, Pittsburgh IS an idiot.

---
Do not apply in game, but on the website.
---
If you cant read and follow directions, you are just another useless highsec miner without a permit.
---
Its indeed a shitty system, most newbies who would like to pvp end up realizing the same.
---
You can still go and get fights but no plexing rewards and crimewatch...
---

---
You guys conveniently left out the bit where Forsaken reset you because you were in fleet with LORDE while they were killing FE pilots, toasting their space, and bashing their structures.
---
If they're such great friends why were you helping their enemies kill them?
---
I mean, I can get some candy if you want ;)
---
It was even, about 50 characters vs 50 characters, on their fortizar grid, with about 10 of their characters being in a dread. When we jumped to kill the Vendetta, they stood down since the forti repaired and a few dozen dudes logged off. After the vendetta kill, c0ne and fweddit left us to go do their own shit in pure blind, and truth be told we were gonna stand down too but then Lord's started smugging in GEK local about saving his fort. We kinda decided that it would be pretty funny to RF it again, so we formed NMs and jumped in (Now down to about 30 dudes) The rest is on the BR.
---
What if the groups were bound rather than the types?
---
-"If you came here seeking for high quality PVP content. I suggest you to re-evaluate your life choices" 
---
- really? ._. 
---
I wish I could barely made half of that PVP.
---
... we did give boss docking access though. And set them blue for the fight
---

---
in a reddit comment section you have to say &gt; you have no idea who i am &lt; 
---
i actually feel bad for you
---
Guessing you weren't at X47, or you'd know the numbers were close to parity. Which would mean you are talking out of your ass?
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/77833797/
---
Because what i know is that a single moon can generate multiple belts per month and you can increase this.          
---
(can be wrong here - aka not a miner)       
---
If belts respawn at DT when they are fully mined out in **a 100 system region**, and you have 4 belts per system on average then :      
---
100 * 4 * 30 = 12.000 potential belts per month you can mine      
---
Now because this includes all types of belts, including small one you can safely reduce this by 50% to get number "big" belts you can have so we get around *6000* big belts.            
---
With the introduction of moon mining - you can now spawn belts, and if you have 4000+ moons you can generate 4000 big belts /month.          
---
And this is still a lot ore - more than people will be able to mine out in this region - even if this is delve.
---
\o/ praise the sun!
---
Because belts are not the issue here just excavators and rorqual alts.         
---
If ccp wanted to remove any of those we would not have constant post about how rorquals are broken.       
---
Well they can be broken but they pour to CCP way to much cash to care about game balance.
---
deadspace xlsb?
---
I recall few years ago they were like lowsec krabs staged in Derelik
---
That Battle report is nowhere close to accurate, there are a lot of kills on the PH side that were not posted to zkill
---
Brave is a good choice if you want null, If you want PVP I would go join factional warfare. FW is the best money you can make PVPing at low skill points.
---
&gt;probably their most difficult rule is the "no swearing",
---
Can confirm. Got a talking-to from multiple directors on multiple occasions.
---
Need to know what you are running to give further advice, are you doing DED sites or anomalies?
---
Yeah, weird timezone/schedule issues and not knowing enough to fc myself were probably the big issues. Had some pretty fun little fleets occasionally though.
---
Wormholers have high standards, if you dont leave on 1% hull after winning, its not good pvp
---
I'm new to the game and have been trying to find an enjoyable way (to me) to make isk. My questions are: Is ore mining a reasonable way to make isk? And the best I've been able to get is around 700k per run, not sure how good or bad that may be
---
Is structure rental actually a thing you can profit from? Or is highsec dominated by well rigged, freeport citadels, that make money off taxes?
---
I recently joined horde pandemic they‚Äôre noob friendly

It's definitely one of the lesser lived/used npc regions due to the limited stations and almost nonexistant mission related stuff.
---
The one cool thing it does have going for it is that it's relatively not under anyone big groups umbrella atm and has allowed to kind of have several smaller groups living there. Also no major group stopping nice moon activity.
---
And curse directly south. Hot bed of some pvp stuff. Missioners as well.
---
Hopefully you stay under the radar of griefers that WARDEC you endlessly
---
I brought KCMO up there for a bit and was told up front that ECHO and FE likely wouldn't blue me until we had proved ourselves because they didn't just want dead weight but if we were actively trying to do shit they would support us. Some of their diplomatic stuff put us in an impossible situation as a smaller group but they never bailed on us and always offered to assist where they were able to. I'd absolutely fly with those guys again because they were up front and honest about what they expected out of someone they would call an ally.
---
And Grinding Gear Games advised CCP to start making small, theme based regular releases :)

Wow how dumb can u be?

Thank you Goons et al for the fight last night in Tenal. Lets all stop blue balling each other and have some fun (‚úø‚ó†‚Äø‚ó†)

 not yet! (currently only checked a bit to see more what you meant in regards to speed, but havent sit down to  watch in attention and details)
---
Mess with gambling hard enough and you'll definitely get fucked anyway.
---
This is what i come to r/eve for. Thanks!
---
Literally close the window when you dock your JF and fire up the next account.  Why does CCP need to play the game for you?
---
Probably full of salt, 0 isk value.
---
/r/Eve encouraging gambling is the the worst thing ccp could ever do

Also /r/Eve drink up motherfuckers

Why would INIT not take the good moons?

Next time get the full picture before trying to shit talk.

\- When you tackle and Orca while an entire super fleet is sitting on standby 4 systems over to drop on neutral nyx being camped in a system what the hell do you expect to happen. We had plenty to nuke the nyx before he could have even said "oh shit" so yeah randoms tackle an orca and we can save it, we do. Stop crying you lost the kill because we brought superior power.

Oh my bad I wasn't aware of the rules.
---
Well, you can. But it's known as waterboarding, and somewhat looked down on.
---
When the recruitment and hiring processes values traits other than competence, such as sex, those additional traits are added to the basket of traits considered.  This basket already includes traits other than competence, such as experience, work ethic, personality, and hygiene.  Every time a trait is added to that basket, other traits must carry less weight percentage-wise.
---
The idea of expanding potential pools of talent is good in theory, but does not survive contact with the unfortunate reality that different pools of humans contain different amounts of talent.  None of us are equal, as individuals or as groups.  Consequently, under-representation cannot be taken as an indication of underutilized talent.  Given the highly competitive nature of societies that accept capitalism, and the pressure from owners of businesses to acquire and profit from talent, under-representation is far more likely to indicate a deficit of talent than some sort of bias.
---
In any case, you could blow my argument about political hires right out of the water with one easy step.  Show me the White Male event that CCP funds.  Not something that's 'implicitly male', something that has White and Male, those two non-diverse categories, in the name.
---
&gt; I sometimes miss those, WITNESS ME fleets.
---
Then there is that moment 5 minutes later when you realize you somehow didn't lose anybody to a fleet that should have been trading ships with.
---
Thanks!
---
So are goons. Again, can't find a difference
---
It‚Äôs a ruse. They never left. 
---
Think about it, they said they left Inperium bc of Pittsburgh getting kicked, but then Rote+co just dunked Pitt‚Äôs vendetta.
---
I know Garric Shadowbane pretty well, he tries really hard (too hard tbh) to have people buy his bullshit narrative, but no way was he going to leave to have Rote leave the safety of Goons.
---
That‚Äôs a fact
---
IIRC, I'm pretty sure you can flag your fleet warp/probe alt to exempt from warp, and you dont need to worry about stopping ship every time. Fun to see tornados used like this!

Because a bee and a wasp are simply not the same either yo.

 Btw, anyone can hint me how to exclude someone from fleet warp? ;D

Wonder how many more jobs that‚Äôs gonna create.

Because they have enough in their own home and don't need to kill content everywhere around them?

Retribution probably a little slower right?

Its not just you, its lot of ppl from all over the world. I think it has something to do with chat. One i think i found that helps, is to close all the alts you dont need, if youre going on a fleet or whatever. When i only have 1 client running, i never get DC.

Very off topic but how does one get started with DED sites, do you stick to the hisec ones or do you venture into lowsec?

A Celestis will shut down many kiting gangs and help clear tackle, and a Bellicose will help apply damage. Big plus if you have a few good tacklers too, to catch them when they wanna egress.

Look at Chessur's Small Gang Archetype video series on youtube. Fight like that against small gangs, dont try and do a smaller version of a big blob.

When a FW system reaches 100% you can bash the I-Hub to flip ownership. But if the opposite militia run defensive plexes and the % goes below 100% the bash is cancelled.
---
So it's important to go beyond 100% to create a buffer.

But that wouldn't show bookmarks. Would be awesome if they add bookmarks to the overview instead...........

Hindsight is easy from a AAR/BR. Having more dudes is always better, that's not in debate! We just didn't. If you wanna join up with us and fly logi it'd be much welcomed. For a small alliance there is a hard limit on how many friends we can bring to a party. Logi was holding our T2 ships easily, T1 logi was getting alphad. That's an SP limitation - those dudes cannot fly T2 logi with more EHP. We have a lot of newbros :) We also did have ewar on field, both in form of webs and jams, they also got alphad. But of course "bring more dudes" is something we'd love to do.

He was in a Monitor because the last time we fought these dudes, he WAS volleyed by enemy DPS. In a command ship. This is a direct change in response to the last fight we took with them. Lessons were definitely learned - it was a mutual fight that we waited for from them and we had a lot of fun. GFs were exchanged. :)

Smells like they did a ctrl-c ctrl-v lol
