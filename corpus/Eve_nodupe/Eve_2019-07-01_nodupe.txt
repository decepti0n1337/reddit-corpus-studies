We are not trying to be right, we are simply doing it to them. Taste of their own medicine  Time is a flat circle after all and history always repeats itself, just the actors change

---
Well I'm likely not the only one out of the loop, is this from something?
---
clearing alt corps that shouldnt be in the alliance anymore. as the members there were in them have been removed for inactivity
---
Galmilistan is literally only GMVA now so might wanna update that.
---
what? take a look at this: https://eve-files.com/media/1312/Station_Cyno_Placement_Guide.pdf
---

---
i count in dockable stations alone ~29 different ones, i ain't taking poses into consideration cause thats just silly
---
hordes stager was reffed, frats stager was reffed, test got reffs, goons got reffs. Granted NC's stager doesn't exist anymore, but to take advantage of one of these timers they'd have to attack someone under their super umbrella and we know that isn't going to happen.
---
lol
---
not if you pop in from the other side of a gate.
---
Battleclinic fits were never good tho.
---
Omega
---
Because there isn't room to have a third active repair archetype.
---
You assume that hull repair needs to be in line with armor repair, but practically every ship would be able to fit an equivalent active hull repair assuming active hull was good. I say practically because Amarr ships generally lack the number of required mid slots even currently. Moving their active tank to mids is a nonstarter.
---
So for Minmatar and Caldari ships, for the most part, an active hull vs active shield fit would be equivalent (and active hull would even be more powerful since it would free up more mids for them to use for utility).
---
Now for Gallente ships, would there ever be a reason to use active armor over active hull? Gallente ships currently have to make a choice between a max gank vs max tank (vs something in between), but also generally have the number of required mids to make using a "good" active hull fit considerable.
---
Hull buffer Gallente ships are actually a fit that is used with good reason and not just for the memes or as a surprise/bait. Hull repair would be too appealing and strong in the case of Gallente ships that 99% of active tanked Gallente ships would be active hull.
---
Currently, Hull repair modules serve a purpose. Formerly it was the "only" way to repair your ship in a wormhole, but even today people actually bring a mobile depot and a hull repair with them so they can stay out longer. Could something be done to make deployment hull repair quicker? Yes. Should something be done? Probably. But should hull repair be balanced to be in line with armor/shield repair? No.
---
You mean just like lowsec people who just wanted to pvp, and got told that now they have to mine moon ore.
---
Oh wait.
---
I dont have to worry about licenses because the owner of the company carries all that I just run jobs.
---
I have absolutely zero desire to own my own construction company, when I feel I'm getting too old to do the field work that I enjoy doing, the first license I will worry about getting will be my building inspectors license.
---
who cares guy, you are such a whiner these days. Grow up son.
---
Does Mittens ass that far up your ass itch little puppet?
---
You have no fucking idea...I woke up this morning and saw over 50 pings/notifications for structures being hit in Delve alone, not even counting our holdings in other regions. Burn out is going to be a very real thing in the next few days
---
&gt;heavy amounts of money
---
Do you have large quantities of isk? If not then good luck. Just like in real life you don't suddenly become an entrepreneur running a $200M company.
---
All paper tigers must burn.
---
I remember flying AHACs against PL who also had AHACs and every time they would drop 10+ titans with each of them DDing a guardian or FC off the field.   
---
Now I'm in snuff and I drop caps on poor lowsex roamers that are just looking for gudfights in subcaps.   
---
I am the bad man now :(
---
Lmaoooooo
---
No i play eve online as its advertised to play your way.
---
I dont play other mmo's cause i dont enjoy pve.

I know its very difficult to wrap your pea brain around that..

You're probably not wrong

I think this war will be a joke :D

Back to Saranen now!!!

&gt; recon PVPers
---
True, but if you're ratting, you probably expect to come out ahead and make isk, right? You're not too likely to come out ahead ratting in a battleship in a wormhole.
---
By being *both* bad *and* stupid they probably proved themselves overqualified for Goonswarm.
---
wow the mittani is short
---
Link please?
---
&gt;increase customer satisfaction
---
The customers are whoever is buying ad space. Are you? If not, you are part of the product. Advertisers are buying access to you.
---
and so is every restriction to a base game, like the entire sov system. good thing emergent gameplay is a meme
---
oh yes the horror of having a shield timer
---
This is a pain in the arse for corps too.
---
they're also used for refining regular ore, which hisec does have a fair bit of most, but nullsec/lowsec minerals are still needed for most things. plus, we have such abundance and good structures, we can produce at a much cheaper price than hiseccers can
---
No, it's just watch people being... watch people.
---
Also true
---
name 1 alliance aside from (apparently?) GSF that actually cares about forming to repel a citadel shield timer
---
Ah, I own/run a general contracting firm.  From my end I hire my own direct employees and also hire for firms to sub the parts that are faster, easier, or more profitable to sub.  As I'm sure you are aware, the industry as a whole are overrun by disreputable chuck with a truck types who think they are capable of doing every aspect of work while understanding little of it and botching more than they manage to get correct.
---
So when I see a guy going on about all the bathrooms he does, and it sounded to me as if you were speaking as a solo gc, and all the other aspects of the work that he does, while admitting hes a shitty sparky, and also showing open disdain for licensing, I mean, thats a guy I dont expect to carry insurance, and a guy I expect would prefer to get paid cash under the table so he doesnt have to report it.  In short, my chuck sense started tingling.
---
I literally turn down a ton of those types for every one direct hire I make.  Fortunately its really easy to pick out subs that fall in that category, just ask to see current licenses and cois.
---
this is the moment when i realised i am a dirty peasent
---
Can someone explain what's going on  ? I'm a bit I understand that the Mittani were one of the more controversial Eve Online corporations.
---
you can say that about literally every single mechanic in the game
---
/&gt;the concept of not hating the goons after fanfest 2012
---
This is fairly comparable to supercap proliferation

you've been visited by the Tyrannos of luck, if you don't say thank mr Tyrannos he will rf your citadel

The look on his face and the "hmm... hmm.." pretty much said it all.

---
LOL.  Upvoted.
---
I literally just started the tutorials today. But everyone says "avoid the scammers". Are there any telltale signs of a "scammer" corp? Not knowing the standard corp/game etiquette yet, I don't know what's expected vs what's unusual.
---
The are no "locals" in nullsec, as in different groups shareing space; in each system / region / constellation you have a coalition that owns the place and that's it. Unless it's Provi, but they are almost there aswell.
---
afaik any semi-decent nullsec group has been fending them off successfuly, but to a great personal toll (people get tired of constantly fighting NPCs).
---
At least that's what I could made out between the massive and almost deafening screeching coming from out there.
---
I noticed. Probably a touch of the 'tism.
---
ASAP
---
Fucking awesome.
---
Great size for display aswell!
---
That's the Idea, i'm trying to decide how to hold it up.
---
Yeah I agree, simplicity and rookie friendliness should be a higher priority for spectre... honestly all they need is a chat channel and a voice server that's it. The website was really good too, it's a shame it's gone now... Daneel worked pretty hard on it.
---
The Trumptani has spoken.
---
At the very least, you're only partly correct. If you get attacked by Drifters in nullsec, chances are pretty high no one will give a shit. Unless you're part of a corporation/alliance and flying something that (1) is worth saving and (2) can survive long enough for help to arrive, no is really going to care.
---
But it sounds like (from the way you are talking about "locals") that you're unaffiliated with any nullsec entity, in which case you'll more likely that no be treated as a neutral. This means the "locals" will more likely be out there looking to kill you just as much as the Drifters.
---
If you want to "avoid losing too much" (whatever that means) you're gonna want to join up with a nullsec corporation. Whichever one you pick is up to you (and their HR team), but don't fool yourself into thinking that various nullsec residents are getting friendly with each other just because of the Drifters.
---
https://www.dailydot.com/news/somethingawful-reddit-jailbait-takedown/
---
And now the Drifters are doing it to Goons. Ah, the Circle of Salt!
---
Is this highsec propaganda?
---
When the salt has its own salt backup.
---
I am a shitty sparky, I'm learning though, I insist on clean tight work and i like to know what I'm looking at when I'm judging other guys work.  Grandfather and Father were both lifetime commercial plumbers, by 8 I knew oakum packing castiron and how to solder copper.  House mousing came easy after that.  I learned duct work layout in a sheet metal shop before plasma cutting tables were a thing, just little old you with the christmas tree scribe getting down. Ran framing jobs for years, during the height of the house explosion, so we were cranking out siding and roofing then, I'll never be a fast roofer, but I'm efficient and pretty.  For the past 6 years or so I've been doing tons of tile work, remodeling bathrooms , mostly in pex though I still ran pipe during the CPVC days (the yellow death glue that got you roached in a crawl space).  
---
Until recently I'd only ever done basic fixture/plug/switch change outs, which I do with the breaker on in case I run into a 70 year old house wiring mystery.  That means every now and then i get zapped a little, no harm no foul, just butterfingers.  I'd rather the breaker tell me I missed something while I'm doing it though.  The last couple six months I'd been getting more hands on with breaker panels. I'd still never touch one without our master electrician around but I'm getting more comfortable.
---
We dont really do sub contract work either, unless its a roof.
---
Whenever you want.  I started this game 2.5 years ago.  I did the NPC corporation for two weeks.  I got tired of PvE early on and got blown up in a wormhole.  I joined their corp and never looked back.
---
Honestly, brands like Rolex and Omega sell more watches to "dirty peasants" than to millionaires. They foster an aura of exclusivity and status, when in reality they pump out millions of watches and sell most of them to people who save for years so they can afford their "grail".
---
If you want to get a classy watch, look for any 60s/70s hand-winding piece, put it on a thin black leather strap, and you're on par with Sir Datejust in the eyes of a connoisseur. My vintage Soviet watches attract more compliments than anything else I've ever worn.
---
&gt; "If you want pvp, take a heap of guys and join smaller groups"
---
&gt; you mean like their sigs, Space Violence, Reavers...
---
those sigs have more members than most alliances, with the guaranteed backing of the biggest alliance in the game. Sigs are a meme
---
Ssshhh! You're ruining the narrative!!
---
It's been so long without talking to another human that I've started setting up corpses in belts and at citadel undocks so I have people to talk to while waiting for content
---
Not his fault he has a congenital brain defect
---
Just out of curiosity. How would these looks if you decided to try and paint them? I've seen a ton of these. While they look *okay* they really don't have that high quality look of a model.
---
Laughing at c4
---
&gt;Is Eve online considered difficult for new players to eventually be able to compete with the more established members?
---
no
---
&gt;Is there relevance to the suggestion that new players don't have a chance to compete against the more established members as the uphill struggle is to steep and the balance of the game structure isn't in the favour of a new entrant to rise up to the same level of more established players?
---
&gt;Is it possible for new members to become high level players in relatively short periods of time
---
yes
---
No. That's just bullshit crying from shitty players who trick themselves into thinking the game is Pay2Win right out of the box without understanding what kind of game EVE is.
---
Yes, but it depends on what you mean "high level player" because EVE is a sandbox.
---
mmmmm spod
---
Used to be that way more back when you needed time to get skill points. Now you can basically buy them. 
---
But someone with 50M skill points isn’t necessarily better than you. What you need to do is specalize. Go for frigates, or cruisers etc. And get all the stuff you can around that.
---
dreddit is recruiting
---
Good to know that five years later, after multiple game shattering changes and a 90% turnover in the player base, that people are still crying about us dropping on frigates with supers in lowsec
---
Can anyone suggest some large yet relatively casual corporations? Eventually I’d like to do PvP but at the moment I’m focused on PvE combat missions and mining and delivery
---
I'm in the same boat but I'm learning the market slowly w some low numbers. I've managed to amass about 500m isk so far but Im still shitdicking around in low money trades. Got a tarya for volume until I can grab a capital ship.. slowly just trying to hollow out my own hunk of the universe. I mostly run trades unless our team is going on trug runs. Our last run made almost 100m idk for each member
---
Give me back WIS
---
Would it be fair to say that the situation has changed for the better or has this never been an issue for new players?
---
That's kind of the point of a fleet in being thou, which is a valid way of doing things.
---
jUsT hIre mIneRs
---
Can corps in an alliance vote or petition to take over the alliance? Such as pushing out the holding corp and take full control in some way.
---
If you're in high sec RUN INCURSIONS. I made enough money to buy a skill injector a week, effectively doubling my skillpoint gains. I miss you WarpToMe.
---
Painting can hide some of the imperfections. this model was printed at .32 layer height, not the absolute highest quality, but the only reasonable height for a print this size. This took about 72 hours to print.
---
Sounds good to me. The more dead supers the better
---
You don't. Play with irl friends instead
---
Get the popcorn fellas, this gonna be good.
---
Interesting. Not too keen on 3d printing so im always finding little facts.
---
Also, didn't want the comment to sound like you did any shoddy work! Lol
---
&gt; No. That's just bullshit crying from shitty players who trick themselves into thinking the game is Pay2Win right out of the box without understanding what kind of game EVE is. 
---
Well there is the old adage  of "a bad workman always blames his tools" and there is a significant learning curve compared to most games which could put some potential players off. 
---
&gt;Yes, but it depends on what you mean by "high level player" because EVE is a sandbox.
---
Well I mean to say the high strata players who are the elite 5% who have the largest ships and largest operations.
---
Just play wow instead
---
This loses most of its impact because "brake" is not the correct word you're looking for, its "break". I just see CCP stepping on a brake pedal labeled "goons".
---
never been an issue.
---
&gt;Used to be that way more back when you needed time to get skill points. Now you can basically buy them.
---
Yes when I had become aware of this potential suggestion it was a few years ago but not recently. I've always very much liked the idea of Eve, and even as a non player I'm aware of the infamous stories :)
---
This print was very fast for my printer (A Monoprice MP Maker Pro which is a rebrand of a Wanhao Duplicator 9) so some ghosting and ringing was expected. I Was really pushing it to build something like this. To be honest I'm really not happy with this printer. I've heard really good things about the Creality CR10 which has a very similar design and identical build volume.
---
join ascee
---
i know that's what he meatn, but pointing to shield as if that explained why is just silly
---
Join their newbro friendly group.  It's called Karmafleet.
---
\^ They've relegated themselves to downvoting on reddit like a bunch of pussies instead of fighting for their space. Same path that TRI took before they became irrelevant.
---
How much in materials did the Hel cost?
---
This took up about 3/4ths of a 1kg roll so about $15 and 72 hours of time. I printed this in Hatchbox red PLA filamen
---
Don't give them money. That's a start. Don't hand over all your stuff to someone that says they'll jump or move your belongings into their space. Be careful if they allow friendly fire inside their corp. Check to see if they're at war. 
---
Most will ask for API checks if they're scared of spies, but honestly a spy will always get in anywhere if they wanted to. 
---
Also, check zkillboard to see how they operate... and maybe evemap.dotlan. 
---
Basically do your homework. Most corps are fine, but there are a few that will do anything to get you in then either scam you or worse, just be a bad corp and waste your time.
---
&gt; there is a significant learning curve compared to most games which could put some potential players off. 
---
Sure, I guess? EVE isn't that hard. It took me maybe a month or so just figuring out the various modules and ships to the point where I'm become confident in my abilities to fit a ship for any purpose.
---
Took about the same amount of time for me to learn all the champions in League, and their common item build paths, Starcraft 2 build orders and timings, etc.
---
i think if you just give it a good effort try and actively try to learn, it's pretty easy to understand in about a month or so. Most people quickly try to find what they want to do (like mining or VNI ratting) and stop trying to learn anything else.
---
&gt;Well I mean to say the high strata players who are the elite 5% who have the largest ships and largest operations.
---
You can keep using different words like "high level" or "high strata" but it's all the same. EVE is a sandbox.
---
If you want the "largest ships", you're gonna want to get yourself a Titan. You can drop mad cash for it and be a credit card warrior if you want, but it's not really recommended.
---
Also, going straight for a Titan is also not really recommended since you'll be lacking in a lot of knowledge. And given that losses in EVE 'matter', a simple mistake could result in you losing that Titan for good (until you get yourself another one).
---
I have no idea what you mean by "largest operations" so I'm not gonna comment on that.
---
:krab:
---
Who are they
---
You keep them, but they are locked to Alpha levels, Omega unlocks everything again.
---
so a general contractor
---
they become unavailable until you went back to omega
---
Is it still possible for a large fleet to get wiped out instantly if they make a mistake? I remember that it was possible for a big fleet that might have taken many months to build up to get completely wiped out in a single battle event which of course does add to the potential drama
---
Tell me more
---
I hear it too. Praise bob.
---
\&gt; Where as Goons have attacked the **players** *outside of the game for* ***years***
---
cite multiple examples or get the fuck out.
---
Thanks !!
---
It's /r/eve. What do you think?
---
I hear AFK baiting is gud
---
grrr
---
at least you don't get downvoted when you tell it like it is.
---
are you a tailor?
---
&gt; to punish the game/CCP by causing HS players to unsub  
---
  
---
It's exactly like that.  
---
With players, you can attack their in game assets.  
---
With CCP, their only in game assets are players.
---
Oh no what will he do without his gay ass reddit points
---
doubtful
---
I looked into this, I appreciate the point in the right direction
---
You flair baiting? I'm assuming you are
---
imagine the smell
---
lmao
---
People are gonna keep making it as long as it generates salt my friend
---
In incursions? Not really. Anything is possible in Eve but incursion fleets are pretty well organized so a whole fleet dying is an ultra rarity. You CAN easily lose your ship as an individual if you don't BROADCAST FOR REPS (ask for healing). There is even a ship replacement program where if you get blown up (for any reason other than being a retard) where if you die your loss is covered 100 precent.
---
Have you been pinged 100 times about one of your citadels getting reffed by these NPCs that shoot out over 350km and hit like old HAW titans? No? Then fuck off.
---
This narrative is so dumb, so so so dumb. You think us in Goons are the only ones annoyed by this? The pro-drifter trend here on r/eve is about to cliff dive into "*everyone who supports this needs to diaf (in game)*" because everyone is realizing what the fuck it **really** is - a dumb idea lacking any foresight with no real reward that is keeping players from interacting with one another and instead focused on some how shooting these near-invisible instalocking instablapping red crosses that ignore normal gameplay mechanics. It's comparable to someone utilizing a hack in call of duty or some shit.
---
CCP is LITERALLY giving nullsec entities Public Service for having established infrastructure. There is a right way and wrong way to hamper structure spam, this is the wrong way.
---
We are going after highsec / lowsec because ya'll are the loudest mouthbreathers in EVE and yet again one of your shit heap ideas made it through the dev desk. Since we suffer, you get to suffer.
---
done and done
---
No.  I work for a GC.  I'm more like a working site manager/foreman.
---
how the fuck did that happen
---
And it's a complete baby tantrum. You prefer to destroy the game, just so that the bitching and whining can become a bit louder?
---
Did Mittens throw out all the mature people from the room, that he keeps on mentioning?
---
To fat to fail.
---
Imagine being so desperate for anti-goon news that the month end alt-corp purge generates a reddit thread. Lmao
---
imagine being this dumb
---
I guess the "Clean my ship" option is now applicable on my ark
---
Yeah I did give it a trial run for a while and although it's got a learning curve that's what's good about the game. A criticism of WoW was that the style of game play was made easier which caused a lot of players to leave.
---
Truth be told, even this is still pulling our punches.
---
I did remodels for 3 years when I was burnt out on overnight technical sales. I ended up getting pissed off at people who kept trying to change shit in the contract time after time. It just wasn't for me.
---
I don't oppose the drifters the way they are now is a shit implementation. But it's been like... what, 4 days? And NS (Imperium being the loudest), already got their panties in a proper twist with buckets of sand in their vaginas.
---
The whole point, is that going after HS literally has shit to do with punishing CCP. And you just managed to prove that you're another puppet dancing to the tune of Aryth's megalomaniac strategy plan, that's been in place well before drifters were introduced.
---
&gt;I have no idea how this would be implemented into the game, but
---
&gt;I think it would be an interesting mechanic.
---
Every time I hear this exact phrase, it's usually a sign that the poster (1) has no idea what they're talking about, and (2) it's a fucking dumb idea.
---
Try it but don’t hangout in high sec space. Join a null sec group and experience that or a WH one. 
---
I’m not up to date on the best ones but I’m sure others can fill that in easily.
---
So your thoughts are:
---
&gt; I think it’s a bad idea. 
---
Being a monumental douche seems unnecessary.
---
OwO
---
Now print up a bunch of drifter ships so you can fuck up the hel’s day irl as well.
---
No, I wanted to make sure OP understood how bad of an idea it is.
---
Good for them. Doesn't change the fact that mittens is a toxic fuck.
---
Bro I've had a woman show up to where we were framing her house every day and make a slight alteration to the shape or size or layout of her kitchen.
---
She had a fucking book of different ideas that was a 3 ring binder thickness of shit she'd compiled that was possible to put in her house and it was nightmarish. 
---
I do NOT miss custom framing at all.
---
Contrary to my EVE posting career I'm actually really good at dealing with weird pain in the ass customers.
---
In incursions? Not really. Anything is possible in Eve but incursion fleets are pretty well organized so a whole fleet dying is an ultra rarity. You CAN easily lose your ship as an individual if you don't BROADCAST FOR REPS (ask for healing). There is even a ship replacement program where if you get blown up (for any reason other than being a retard, BROADCAST FOR REPS!!!!) where if you die your loss is covered 100 precent. Also incursions are fun as hell!!! It's like an Eve raid! WarpToMe are good people too, great to start out with and learn.
---
Maybe we could get the ability to idk walk in stations? 
---
Too soon?
---
they one of the smaller of the two goon new bro corps.
---
Do you want a new citadel interior?
---
He does!
---
Youre irrelevant babe
---
I feel like its not necessarily in-line with the main ideas behind the game. If it were well designed to encourage pvp or pve, then I guess it would be fine but the player involvement benefits would need to be well thought out.
---
^^^ this guy gets it. 
---
The only thing more uninteresting then fighting a one sided war against structures in NS would be to do the exact same thing in HS.
---
Join a random null sec corp and mine moons, you can get like 2 a week
---
I did actually used to be a big wow player but that was a few years ago.
---
&gt;*agrees its a terrible implimentation of gameplay*  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;*doesnt understand why people are upset*
---
Also going after highsec is perfectly supported after you guys have consistently screeched about nullsec and complained as loud as you possibly can about shit you know nothing about. If our way of life is getting fucked with then it's only proper highsec / lowsec gets equal treatment. This "strategy plan" you speak of is laughable because no one really gives a damn about highsec, until now, when you decided to poke your fingers in the hornets nest by asking for changes without truly thinking forward and what may happen down the road. Enjoy your travels in 0.5+ safety, nerd.
---
I doubt you helped OP to understand anything
---
Thats an awesome print. How could I make one for myself?
---
" But it's been like... what, 4 days? " and it takes CCP like ... what, about 6 months to a year to fix things when they fuck them up? Can you see why people might not be real excited about waiting that long?
---
Y tho
---
He helped OP to understand how much of a douche he is.
---
So if you were to start from scratch what pathway would you take? Is there a pathway you'd recommend to someone like myself thinking of starting to play.
---
he actually went out of his way to tell people not to manipulate the plex market in all this, so he's not trying to kill the game, just smack CCP around hard enough that they wake up and fix what they did.
---
Yes, I'm sure you're *very* elite.
---
I'm shocked at how helpful you guys have been at this noon post. I've applied to karma for now! Thank you all!
---
I couldn't have handled that nitpicky bullshit. I transitioned to flips where NO ONE WAS LIVING IN THEM and we were just getting them to saleable condition. lightyears better on my sanity.
---
&gt;i made the comment as a meme
---
TL: "I said a shitty thing and I don't want to lose my irrelevant internet points".          
---
&gt;but serious discussion though, you can roll and set up your wormhole where the only way someone can enter the wormhole is if they open a new wormhole that rolls into you, thats cutting off the ways enter your krabbing system by half. 
---
You've never actually lived in wormholes, have you?
---
That is very true, but mining moon goo isn't nearly as fun as running TCRC's!!! Hell even a TPPH is better than mining!
---
Yeah there's some epic videos on YouTube!
---

I joined when Eve online had a 7 or 10 day free trial and although there is a significant learning curve the community were really helpful. 
---
I'm sure there's plenty of basic guides to help you get started. I've always enjoyed the strategy side of the game, the economics and that type of thing.
---
They should be spending their time figuring out a way to encourage player alliances to take and hold sov, not coding NPC AI to do it.

Nothing about shooting rat's in this game is 'fresh'
---
Yet we have zero clue how long this drifter shit is going to last, or if it will stay in its current form.
---
Sure... if it's the same crap we're seeing now, 3-4 weeks from now, I'd agree that it's a major fuck up on behalf of CCP, and the Reee is both deserved and well due. But we're not there yet, are we?

Literally the biggest group in the game by far. Krab is just a term used as a name for those who just PvE in general I believe. Such as mining or shooting pirate NPCs to earn money. That's about it.
---
You'll learn how the game works and grow as a player if that
---
If you know what it means, it’s a word, just like “ain’t”.
---
That is how English works.

Aryth, is quite literally, speaking about The Imperium's HS plans 3 months before the drifters were introduced. Guess you were giving a fuck about HS, completely unrelated to CCP's latest potential screw up.
---
You manage to miss, or not being able to comprehend, the entire point of the original post. Nerd.
---

---
(i'm not shilling for goons i promise #nogoon)
---
Pretty broad question with broad answers. Tristans are good for solo, and a solo rorq can be pretty mean when fit right. What do you want solo ship for (FW, hunting VNIs, solo against the odds) and then it helps narrow your search
---
I sure hope that's the actual case. Doesn't entirely fit with what Aryth has been saying though.
---
Probably just an accumulation of items CCP has given to all accounts over the years.

Just offerings to the drifters to continue mining salt in null.
---
Hell yeah there are. Flying logi (healing ships) in incursions is extremely fun as well, you have to pay attention way more than dps ships and it gets the heart pumping pretty often. Saving your mates gets me fucking DIAMONDS. Logi life = best life.
---
Dirk Johnwood called me gay on jabber once. Was a pretty vicious attack outside the game if you ask me. Even it its true :(

The fact that I'm irrelevant is, in itself, irrelevant to my point. Note the use of the first person plural pronoun.

3 months ago it was "maybe".

Today this "maybe" have grown into "sure".  Thanks CCP.
---
How does anybody get to own a Titan class ship? I'm guessing it would take more than a year and I'm guessing people have been playing for years and don't ever get to own one. That's just a guesstimate based on what I've just googled on the value of these.
---
Can a boi get a file for this bad boi?
---
Remember goons of old? 
---
Oh, how much fun they would have had "recruiting" this poor soul.
---
But if have would just be bothered to find one of the shows that they did when the PLEX prices spiked he said himself that he personally don't like to mess / manipulate that specific market.
---
Yeah, it's more what I expected tbh, so I feel lucky to potentially not have that stuggle
---
Oh, there will be salt, and it will be exporting from null to a hi-sec near you soon...
---
can always change it to aggression timer (npc/player). Not that hard to make it so its not abuse-able, the main point is to make it reasonable to repair while out of combat/combat situations. No one wants active hull tanks, but they should serve as a way to repair hull damage inbetween fights.
---
Also, if you don't have enough dps to break a hull tanked mining ship in 1 min and can't break its 1min repair time, then i guess you didn't bring the right ship(s).
---
You can jettison them all at once and they go up around you in a sphere. At least they used to
---
If Goons weren't doing it now NCPL would be. If they wouldn't do it someone else would. That's the circle my friend.
---
So... if I'm reading this right, guess I'm holing up in the ole wormhole. See, it's nice to be able to do that seeing as asset safety is a thing in lowsec.
---
Never been an issue. The game is stupidly easy, but the resources to explain it are obnoxious.
---
they're available on thingiverse
---
I also like to spin.
---
They aren't here to ruin the game, they here to ruin OUR game.
---
Check the gs_isk logs on your krab alt. We've been very explicit about not touching PLEX. We consider it a line that can't be crossed lightly. Crossing it means no going back.
---
The STL file is available on thingiverse, just need a 3d printer, I cut this one in half on meshmixer and had to do a lot of tweaking to get the supports to remove properly.
---
Well they ARE expensive, requiring high skills and big money! Upwards of 50 billion idk or thereabouts. Over a year is definitely right. You gotta save, grind and pinch pennies till you can to get one. (Or slap down that American Express for Plex). IMHO you should go after a Titan only after you've skilled into everything else you want to fly. You get way more fun and content NOT in a Titan than IN one. I can honestly say I love cruiser sized ships MORE than Titans.
---
And be permanently dedicated and ready to stop you from playing the part of the game that you would like to play? Sounds to me like something no one would be bothered to do.
---
You two both sound like pathetic losers.
---
Is mining more profitable for a beginner?
---
Yup. I know. I listened to that show as well.  
---
He also forgot to mention that he can't really invest in PLEX, due to being a CSM member, and PLEX pretty much constantly being influenced by planned PLEX sales (some of which the CSM are told of in advance).
---
But still. Very noble of him...
---
Asking the real important questions.
---
Edgy, good luck with that though. Should be entertaining to watch you attempt that and then see all the indy guys cave to the huge demand/profits to be made.
---
Things costing more actually combats the inflation in the economy as well, so you're helping things from rorq spam.
---
&gt;But it's been like... what, 4 days? And NS (Imperium being the loudest), already got their panties in a proper twist with buckets of sand in their vaginas.
---
Relatively speaking, 4 days is practically an eternity.  ​They haven't even begun to attack HS yet and here *you* are.

Yeah and a nice Corp will help you overcome the learning curve. Tons out there it really depends on what you like. Most corps are cool and if you want to bounce to do something else they understand
---
We require paps? I thought we were the afk vacation corp?
---
to bad caps cant be used in highsec .
---
I'm deeply sorry that our organizational direction isn't entertaining to you. We've failed you both as the wardens of the video game and as a circus act.
---
That sounds like something a poor person would say. 
---
Jokes aside the typical Patel “look” is definitely something you either love or hate. Truth be told for that kinda money I’m buying an Audi RS5 rather than a watch.
---
Probably not more than the number you'd need to take on any other Titan, really. It's the other three and the response fleet, which might include an Iapetan (and talk about a market crash if one of those fucking things warps onto the station), that you would have to really worry about.
---
Asset safety, panic buttons, super umbrellas, fuck even local chat kind of break that original idea... you could find a hundred things that contribute to the eve we have today, which is not at all what was imagined in 2003.
---
Your best bet is joining a industry Corp and starting with moon mining buybacks and learning the ropes of industry from them. They shuffle a lot of product around, but you need to ask yourself why you want to do it? ISK is isk's sake is a good way to burn out. 
---
If you enjoy spreadsheet economics, you'll love industry. If you just want big Bank account, I'd find something more fun or just buy some Plex and go with IRL little extra if short on cash to get it.
---
That’s a really good point
---
&gt; you have to pay attention way more than dps ships and it gets the heart pumping pretty often. 
---
Yeah I can imagine it definitely does!
---
Can you still join directly or is it all via Steam? If there's a choice is there any preference between the two?
---
All progod does is cry, if thats the one you mean
---
What smell? It's space.
---
I also grew up in the industry, dad was a union carpenter, although he almost exclusively worked heavy and highway.  In the off season he slowly amassed investment property,  that is to say he would buy up dogshit houses and we would either renovate and sell, or we would work them into multi family housing, I mean you arent taking work from the unions if you are working on your own shit.  I spent most of my teens doing renovation, maintenance, and turn arounds.  Did that through college, got my degree in construction management.  Worked a couple years, then realized I was getting a salary for essentially making the whole pie, decided to just make the whole pie on my own.
---
I consider myself fortunate that I came up working in renovation,  I'm firmly of the opinion that two guys, identical in potential and talent could get started, one in renovation and the other in new construction, and after a couple years the renovator could do the new construction guys job better while new construction would be lost in renovation.  You learn to spot the fuck ups, and then you learn to foresee the fuckups and prevent them from happening in the first place. 
---
Electrical is so much easier when you get to lay it out yourself, no digging into some ancient two strand fiber insulated shit that runs god knows where.  Residential panels are pretty straightforward, dont touch the breaker screw, and dont ever cross the bus panels.  Three phase buses can get pretty complex, mostly in that you are running a black, a red, and a blue, at the exact ordering is critical, and then you start running into complex transformers and interesting voltages and a ton of math and other fun shit.  120/240, I mean whatever, paired breakers for 240 and just dont lick it.
---
Tracing circuits is also pretty straightforward,  I'd have accurate circuitry diagrams of all the renovations by the time they were done, and always worked dead.  I also knew guys with snips that look like they were hit with fucking at rounds cause they didn't give a shit if it was live or not.  When I would do it I just kept a box of plug testers on hand, I would figure what switches went to what lights or outlets, then I would stick a tester in each outlet, flip a breaker, and then note what testers were off on a diagram.  It went pretty quick.  I would also verify both plugs were dead before actually pulling a given outlet.  The only spot that would really cause issue is if you had a complex switch that was installed by someone who had no idea how to run the control, the emf beepy testers are a great help with tracing those down so long as you arent working with some 3/4 in horsehair and slat wall. 
---
The housing boom were good years, I was building a spec subdivision from 04 that finished in 07.  I had two crews framing to windows and water tight, then subbed out the guts, and came back after drywall and paint to do floors and millwork.  
---
I'll tell you, while I always hated shingle roofs,  I make a shitload on metal roofs, I can bid the same labor but get them done in half the time.  They are easy to sell as well,  I just point out the 40 year paint warranty.  
---
Shit man, in a game full of computer and it nerds its kind of rare to find a chance to talk about this shit beyond walking some nerd through some shit like cleaning a p trap, or diagnosing a horribly overloaded circuit in their home office, or explaining what end of the hammer does what.
---
The real question is "do I enjoy mining?" Personally I love mining and then producing ships with the minerals. To answer the question tho.... Maybe? It depends on what you're comparing it to and what you're mining.
---
 High sec belt ores may as well be garbage, but moon ores can be pretty profitable. Any decent mining Corp should have several moons available a week to mine.
---

Putting a turd on top of a turd doesn’t make the first turd go away it just makes the whole room stink.
---
And all they have to do is say something along the lines of its not long term and give a loose window of how long it will last and a lot of the anger would dissipate instead they continue to be silent on the topic which just sets people off more.

They’re LCOs they take no damage.

I do a mean rolled rubber too, though I'm really particular about slack and bubbles in the rubber, theres no reason for it if your roll out was controlled and steady and your adhesive was properly set before you started the roll.

The "Northland" (north western wisconsin/north and eastern north minnesota) is pretty much all houses built in the fucking 40's, so you find some wild shit up here.

Thanks for that! Are there restrictions with the trial account still do you know although I'll probably just sign up as a full member to avoid any potential restrictions.

I remember it being difficult to think of a really good name though without sounding cheesy and you want the name to sound appropriate. 
---
I don't think you can change a name can you in Eve? From memory you can't delete an account either once it's opened.
---
Now here's a little bonus too, after you've been playing for a while and have become rich, skilled and experienced, you can join an alliance in lowsec or nullsec and start bringing FECKING CAPITAL SHIPS to incursions. I now run incursions with my alliance, Goonswarm, and bring my Thanatos carrier and it's a goddam blast. Goons are not the only null alliance that does them either. And hey with all this Drifter and Triglavian stuff maybe we will get a new incursion type to run! (Please CCP I'll do anything)
---
I'm not the one claiming I want to hurt CCP's asset.

Is it possible to take two different pathways in terms of game play style for instance as a solo style player vs a team group style player?

&gt; Aryth, is quite literally, speaking about The Imperium's HS plans 3 months before the drifters were introduced.
---
Why do you imagine that should matter?  Is the rest of NS supposed to object to the idea of playing right into Aryth's hand?
---
Whether it works or not, NS deploying to HS would be *hilarious* and it's not like there's anything better for null to do, now, so... why not?

---
Bro my in-game name is Kale Skywalker haha who cares about cheesy just don't be cringe and name yourself something way out there and you'll be fine haha. Nah the trial doesn't matter, however, since you'll be a fresh character you'll probably take a month or two to skill into the appropriate ship for incursions, use that time to run missions, PvP a little, lose some ships and learn the basics of combat and by the time you can fly the ship you'll be comfortable doing so. Speaking of losing ships, treat them like ammo, expendable. You take them out, they go boom, you get another, it goes boom. High sec incursion ships tend to be expensive and are one of the rare exceptions to this rule, but even then don't be too concerned. Keep enough isk in the bank to replace it if need be and avoid any system where gank blobs hang out and you'll be fine. High sec isn't 100% safe, no where is, but it takes a large, coordinated force to take you out before Concord saves you.
---
Before, Panfam massacred the enemy with hundreds of Supers. And at that time there was a CFC that could stop it. Now Imperium is ruining the economy with thousands of Rorqual and Ratting Boats, and thousands of Super destroy the entire universe. The difference is that Panfam can not stop it.

Yes of course. Stealthbombers delete entire fleets quite often, sadly I couldn't find any good recent vids. https://youtu.be/uZuLuScOI4g?t=71  
---
Although there days, resources and ships easy to obtain, so fleets generally don't take months to build. I guess maybe supercapital fleets, those don't die that often, but still it's entirely possible.
---
Or it's an attraction mechanism, like feramones

Yeah. Is there anyway to see them? I thought there were variations in them depending on your starting faction.
---
Very few but Eve Uni does have them and it's actually accurate on those.

Um, I'm your friend but I don't have a Big Hel, what gives?
---
Yeah you can, depending what you want for solo. If it’s all fighting things Npc and pvp then it’s similar.

You’ll find most people have multiple accounts to specalize. Ie: market trader, hauler, pvp, etc

Mittani is pissed because the game is the way he likes. And drifter invasion is wiping a bunch of fleets, which is fun, that's all.

You're lucky you only bought plex so could still contract it to your main. Some people make the mistake of buying omega time through steam and get screwed over when the time goes to the steam created account and they can't do anything about it.
---
Most other fit sites are not that much better either.
---
Tbh, i've never seen a site who properly explains the philosophy behind how to fit a ship either.
---
I do recall a dev stating that they were purposely slow so that hull tanking was a pure buffer tank. If the reps were better it would defeat that purpose
---
&gt;I'd been getting more hands on with breaker panels. I'd still never touch one without our master electrician around but I'm getting more comfortable.
---
Never touch the big two wires at the top (because the line side has no breakers, you'll die and it'll hurt the whole time you're dying), label your neutrals and never land two of them under the same lug.  All you need to know.
---
Who cares if it's spin or not.  It's something that makes sense to do, given the current meta, so why not?  "Oh hey guys this is something that would be awesome, but people might see it as spin, so let's not do it?"

---
Fair points and, from my casual perspective, I agree. Although, I think making some sort of ai faction that attempts to hold sov could drive fresh pvp and pve events.
---
Although, as I posted above, I have no idea how that would actually be implemented. I dont have enough knowledge if null sec sov mechanics to provide actual technical ideas.

---
&gt; OFFICIAL STATEMENT ABOUT THE DRIFTER EVENT:    
---
&gt; We've had several days to gather data about this event and can now conclude that:      
---
&gt; \- the npcs are not clearing bots (see killboard)      
---
&gt; \- the  npcs are not clearing low-power citadels spam, they seem to mostly hit active ones      
---
&gt; \- the AI is not dynamic is is simply spawning waves in the same systems every day      
---
&gt; \- there is no reward whatsoever for killing the npc waves      
---
&gt; \- there is no story/progression like they had the Triglavian phase with the sites evolving    
---
&gt; The whole event appears to a **purely punitive design** where large null blocs are forced to deal with tedious waves of the same npcs **every day, several times a day** without any reward. From a customer point of view, this is purely a time waste inflicted by the company on null members for playing the game along the mechanics they themselves implemented.    
---
&gt; At the same time, the event is used to score popularity points with another group of customers that resent the null block gameplay. A lazy shortcut appeasing some revenge fetishes instead of the hard work required to fix the deeply rooted issues affecting the game right now.    
---
&gt; My view is that this is unacceptably dishonest behavior for CCP as a company, and as such we support cooperating with other null entities as customers to keep the company honest. I do not believe in big hyperboles of outrage, but I do believe the nullbloc entities are a large stakeholder in eve as a game, and in eve as a business. If the company cannot deliver a fair service to us as customers, it is within our right to react in kind.    
---
&gt; \-Vladimir Ilyich Gobanov
---
Done and done =\]
---
So the entire coalition?
---
Goons had pvp?
---
We could suggest things, but you don't have the contextual knowledge that comes from actually playing the game if you haven't started yet. My advice: just go play the game, it's literally free. Just don't stay in hisec, you'll burn out and quit if you do, go out and join an alpha-friendly group and go nuts. You'll discover what you like soon enough.

He's not wrong though, roll your wandering holes then your statics, as long as you don't warp to your new statics a sig won't generate in the connected hole.

---
Is this a "If they don't do what we want we're threatening to cancel our accounts" post? 
---
God I hope so
---
As long as they don't give a single drop of ISK.
---
We don't need more faucets.
---
[Oh look, here he is talking about exactly that.](https://soundcloud.com/luke-antra/gobbins-csm-townhall-2019-06-09) Btw there may not be an act
---
My plan is to eventually get a 3D printer, make a model like what you have then make the negative casing in greensand for the casting process.
---
I still gotta get the printer, build my furnace, ext.. but I already got the aluminum saved up lol.
---
So is Bearhole what y'all are calling Delve now or what?
---
This entire event had made me wonder if CCP has hit some sort of data metric.
---
Like 95% off Nullsec plays for free by buying plex. CCP seeds 50% of the Plex to keep market inflation down. 45% of Plex is actually purchased with real money.
---
Screw it. Cut off the freeloaders.
---
IDK. Just a thought.
---
*Laughing at Bluedagger*
---
What a time to be alive, hiseccers actually thinking they're people.
---
I came to wh to get away from capitals tbh
---
Huddle up, team!
---
...not so close.
---
i have a blank character file in evemon.
---
you can load your skill queue in and apply it to the blank character.
---
then export it as an .eml file. which you can save for your own use or share with others.
---
load the .eml file into any existing character to apply it.
---
also I bet goons already have another way to tell if someone else is reading the data from ESI. All you would have to do is notice some behavior that changes based on pulling the data, either rate-limiting or caching and then verify that the observed behavior matches what you would expect when one or more than one service is pulling the data.
---
Some of us drive top-end Audis and an unironic Fitbit.
---
I'm honestly down for the accelerated dying of EVE if it will get CCP to communicate more and implement/fix mechanics faster
---
Thank you for actively admitting that you're the sole driving force stagnating the game. 
---
But we already knew that.
---
Idk about that. Goon tears are pretty fresh. Quite enjoyable really.
---
I'm having fun!
---
You know I am fine with this. I can make more money with my mining then.
---
Why some Goons think they're the only people who play is beyond me.

Holy shit someone actually *married* him?
---
&gt; Drifters are inherently broken. they can lock track and land hits from 15,000km, they cannot be scanned down, and are immune to damage caps on structures making response time a serious issue, add an inability to scan or probe them down means something kills you form the far side of the grid with no possible counterplay 
---
They're an advanced civilization, unknown to us humans. It's doesn't have to make sense what they do. Just adapt and build new strategies around that in order to survive. They have to be broken. Just imagine normal rats around null sec, it wouldn't be a danger for any alliance, they would be laughing by now.

I have FCed anti-carebear suicide ganking fleets for the past three days with monumental success. We have gained lots of loot off the dead corpses of those bears and gotten great kills. If anyone wants to join my daily fleets, please contact me in-game (Shadow Cyrilus is the character).
---
I can't believe it, but I agree with you.  The way they are currently implemented is stupid.
---
Probably intentional BM. Create a new reddit account to copy/paste a rage inducing zero-format wall of text to discount the post's contents. :smart:
---
They have people working on it! I still believe!
---
While I do agree with not needing more faucets, they would need to be rewarding somehow. I wouldn't feel right saying they should replace Sansha Incursions completely because I don't really want to advocate for the removal of any content. Maybe they could only replace the Sansha spawns in null? Overall here I just want more fun co-op content for us all. On that note thank you CCP if you're reading for the 3 man frigate abyss option.
---
ask your og nerds who digi was
---
Holy shit it is. 
---
Goons are gonna need a binding resolution.
---
Fake, only goons are complaining.  The rest of NS loves these.
---
It would be nice if we could learn from this and not do it at all.
---
You wouldn't say that in PST.
---
&gt;we want to PvP
---
No you fucking don't.

idk if I can run evemon I'm lowkey on a macbook &amp; too lazy to figure out wine.

TILDEWAY TO HEAVEN

It seems as if space actually has a distinct [smell](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/what-space-smells-like/259903/).
---
I saw who added on here and couldn’t help myself.
---
No actually, I haven’t been pinged 100 times, cause I’m not in goons (aka, I’m not an asshat).
---
You make a pretty broad jump that ccp has no endgame for this event. Maybe they do, but it hasn’t been revealed yet. But why let that get in the way of a good “Reeeeeeeeee” post.
---
Oh, now goons are going to ruin hs. I keep hearing that and yet I still don’t see shit other then “just wait til we get there next week/month/quarter/year.” I am just waiting for the spin “Well, we turned back because we won/got bored/decided to give hs a break”
---
See you in hs!
---
Sure. In a few months he's going to be too rich to care.
---
Are you sure you want Waffe crashing on Hoegaarden's couch?
---
There are no *real* blues in wormhole space. We use blue mechanics the way they should be used: 
---
We blue someone for a week, kill folks, then drop blues and shoot eachother like Bob intended. 
---
Blue only exists so you know who to invite to fleet that week. Next week, you shoot them.
---
You have to admit though that it was more of an achievement back then, in the pre injectors era
---
But yeah fuck supers in general, just remove them from the game all together I say vOv
---
Solve his problems for him, and he'll probably wear cuffs and a ring gag for you.
---
NPC instalock and scram gets anotha one..
---
Oh and not being able to dscan them.. cuz yeah.. fuck you.
---
You guys could take note. Maybe you could create content without caps.
---
I get to say hello the only way i know how. Cloak up and warp off....
---
God i am lonley.
---
Let's be honest. Look at the current retention rates. Goons don't need to do anything in highsec for 90% of people to quit within 7 days. A majority of the 10% most likely join a Corp or quit anyways. 
---
It's a sandbox. If they want to hit structures in highsec, so what.
---
Lol great idea let's piss off half the game that's a great marketing strategy
---
Haha i read something like that before - didn't read whatever was linked if it's a meme. But I have read that. Either way, the corpses are frozen.
---
Is this just fantasy?
---
&gt;  they would need to be rewarding somehow.
---
You can do this without ISK
---
K-space ones have doomsdays like they always have, they're not the same as wormhole ones that don't have them.
---
&gt;Why isn't this new event PROFITABLE for MEEEEE?
---
CSM members aren't allowed to trade, invest or manipulate goods in Eve that are due to be changed, or considered to potentially be changed in the future. An example is when Brisc got incorrectly banned, because CCP thought he had leaked NDA covered information to another Initiative member about the HAW changes to titans, leading to that person selling their Molok because of it.  
---
PLEX is more or less always covered in that, due to re-occuring sales. Same goes for Multiple Pilot Training Certificates, skill extractors etc.  
---
If I were a CSM member, and allowed to invest in PLEX while being on the CSM, I could make fortunes due to knowing when to sell/buy depending on upcoming sales and discounts on PLEX/DLC on behalf of CCP. So... yeah, they're obviously not allowing that.
---
Sounds like they need some freedom
---
Being able to at least seem them on Dscan before warping right to them would be an improvement as well.
---
A man of culture I see (the Audi not the fitbit). 
---
What do you drive? I have a 2016 A4 Quattro, next year thinking of turning it into an RS3.
---
Emergent gameplay
---
So either kill the drifters before they make tons of timers, or wait on armor timers in case someone shows up? 
---
Sounds like a PITA either way.
---
&gt; CCP: lets annoy nullsec people  
---
&gt; Nullsec people: let's pass this onto somebody else  
---
&gt; Highsec pubbies: get their shit pushed in, and quit  
---
&gt; CCP: &lt;pikachuface.jpg&gt;
---
&gt;why can't i just krab in PEACE? REEEEEEE
---
-nullsec, 2019
---
Cowardly CCP
---
The last time CCP seriously screwed up was during monocle-gate.  It took all of the playerbase protesting for them to walk it back.  It will take the same level or response for them to walk this back.
---
&gt; Like 95% off Nullsec plays for free by buying plex. 
---
That's not how buying PLEX works
---
what about for capitals etc?
---
did you know that before 2015, pl worked with goons to evict bob from delve?
---
man that really doesn't fit your narrative does it
---
that not bad really
---
&gt;Also, holy fuck your attitude is toxic. You're literally discussing it'd be a good thing to break the game and have all of null blue to one another, not a single fight, and go out to blob smaller individuals to no gain to you, just to make them unable to play.
---
Horde, TEST and goons are blue in Perimeter, in that we don't attack shit there and split the profits. In null we still stomp each other at every opportunity. 
---
Its like two criminals not calling the cops on the other guy when they battle for turf, because then it'll be mutually assured destruction as they both testify against each other.
---
Every noob loves Super capitals because they sound badass, but the gameplay surrounding them is unfortunately very stale, risk averse, and boring. To get one you need to operate in null sec with large established groups, which means joining a big blob of other players doing the same boring thing. Trust me, this is not where the fun exists in Eve, and it hasn’t been that way in a long time. The reasons are numerous but that’s another conversation.
---
The fun exists in places like WH space, low sec FW etc not because these mechanics or goals are better, but because you are more likely to find smaller groups or even the odd solo player to fight for and against. Small group play is where Eve shines, big blobs suck for everyone.
---
For these areas you only need a frigate, and can decide what you want to aim for after playing around a while. You’ll meet highly skilled players rather than entitled whinging ship spinners, and learn much faster. 
---
Have fun!
---
Theres very little aluminum siding left around here, between every color but white looking like shit due to oxidization, and a major freak straight line windstorm that hit back in the mid 90s, we are damn near uniformly vinyl around here.  Creating faraday boxes are not a giant concern.
---
Around here, the pre war stuff is probably my favorite housing to dig in to, although it is probably the worst to try and bid work on. 
---
With the exception of a couple tracts of railroad housing built in the teens its all essentially bespoke houses, I renovated one that had a 12x12 hand hewn rim joist, square mill cut lumber, and a mix of square and round nails, an outlier for oddity for sure, but representative in a way.  Another old farm house I found that they had used paperwork from construction as insulation, materials invoices and payroll logs and stuff,  they worked 6 day weeks, camped on site, paid in for communal meals, and went to town on sundays.  A window into the 1880s.  
---
I mean, what other line of work lets you leave a mark that can last?  I always felt if I was in another line of work the monotony of doing the same thing every day would eventually drive me to shoot myself.
---
can't wait to see all the Nerds get Concorded
---
It is literally profitable for no one.
---
No material reward? Really? You would fly them for just the fun of it? Idk if that's what you mean but I think we all want some kind of material reward for our space activities. The only activity that you don't really materially profit from is fleet PvP, and then the reward is that coveted green entry on zkill and the eye sodium of your enemy.
---
Are you fucking kidding me lol
---
Unless this is flairbait you’re a retard
---
It's almost like annoyed Nullsec empires burn Highsec from time to time. Perhaps put bounties on specific ships. Set fire to market hubs.
---
Who could possibly have seen this coming?
---
Wow i've never heard about the Iapetans before.  That's super neat lore
---
CCP, bend the knee while it's still not too late.

"Wait... Anyone I know?"

how do you do it with 1 super?
---
Are you saying a region is supposed to have MORE people or less? Because if less then it'll be even more difficult to fight the drifters because of timezone inconveniences and people having jobs. And if more then how the hell can we be more than like 5000 people with several alts each, in just 80 systems? Should legacy and goons join together in one region in order to have the gunners to not burn out because of drifters?
---
&gt;No material reward? Really? You would fly them for just the fun of it?
---
Are you fucking blind? I said no ISK.
---
You can introduce LP, blueprints, materials, whatever. Just no ISK.

I’m saying no corp should own a whole fucking region.
---
Maybe. Depends if any sun is near. Due to the lack of any transfer if heat any extra radiation applied effectively keeps it unfrozen. Takes a long time to actually freeze in space.
---
nobody in null *likes* these. they're a headache at the absolute best
---
what everybody else is laughing at you about isn't the fact that drifters attacking your structures is contrived, dumb gameplay, it's how dramatically you overreacted to it
---
Not even CCP. Do recall they spent Dev time on this at the expense of other things.
---
Love Deaths and Robots disagrees, I have to go with their science, I'm sorry.
---
Lol. That show is definitely a great work of fiction.
---
Well when the options are:
---
1) Game marches towards a slow, whimpering death due to large empires
---
Or
---
2) Create a shake-up that undermines large empires but keeps game alive 
---
What would you choose? And if your answer is:
---
3) I actually have a better idea than CCP! Look it’s simply do X and Y instead, duh
---
Then you fail to realise that any change which actually disrupts the status quo will result in the same amount of playerbase salt. So pick 1, 2 or don’t whinge at all.
---
Got a TL:DR for people at work?
---
2 hours lol
---
It's what goons do.  My statement was directed to some posters who were insinuating that the rest of NS was fine with how it was implemented.
---
I calculated the number of tornados it would take a long time ago, when considering whether or not it would be possible to suicide gank Chribba's dreadnought in amarr (since he was/is famous for occasionally mining veld with it).
---
The answer is: Enough to crash the grid.
---
A titan has even more EHP, so...
---
inb4 ccp removes wardecs
---
You can tell that this isn't about the health of the game to them. They don't give a shit about the health of the game. This is just a power play to keep their legions of mindless followers behind them. They're willing to do their damnedest to destroy this game if it means that nobody gets to play any way but their way.
---
Fuck these assholes. Come to wormhole space, none of that BS here.
---
What a bunch of babys lol.
---
&gt;Highsec pubbies: get their shit pushed in, and quit
---
Optimistic much?
---
Are..... Are you gonna cry? Please don't I never really know what to do when I see a stranger cry IT'S SO AWKWARD. On a more serious note I'd love to shove more than words down your throat bro, it's not gay unless our balls touch.
---
This asserts that the majority of the playerbase considers mechanics designed to limit the size of null powers by requiring them to actively maintain their space a bad thing.
---
It does not. I'd wager the majority of the playerbase is perfectly fine with these mechanics.
---
It is such a waste of a great opportunity.  Have them hunt bots in anomalies or clean out low power citadels along with a long list of other things.  Instead we got this crap.
---
:siren: DELETE THIS RIGHT NOW, IT GOES AGAINST THE GRR GON NARRATIVE :siren:
---
Be the change you wish to see in the world. Unsub. Put your money, or the lack thereof, where your mouth is and be the leader the rest of us can follow.
---
Otherwise you're a hypocrite.
---
Just speaking for myself here, but I don't want them to walk it back. I want them to make it meaningful. An actual challenge to some of the issues with null right now. A solution to structure spam (which it isn't right now, according to reports), a challenge to uncontested ratting (which it might be? I think I've heard of two supers either killed or threatened?), could it somehow create emergent gameplay for those contesting super umbrellas? Anything but another "make sure you fuel this" or "make sure you check this box too". Issues that are handled by a select few alts with access rights. That isn't adding anything meaningful to the sandbox.
---
But yeah for real, LP etc would be cool. Some people use "isk" as a blanket term for any kind of profiting and I assumed that's what you meant. Take a breath lol.
---
Lol, capitals, [Alpha Skillset](https://www.eveonline.com/article/clone-states-the-next-steps) .
---
I don't disagree that the mechanics need tweaking. They need to prioritise low-power structures and need to focus their efforts on less-populated space on the fringes of player empires.
---
I do disagree, though, that the mechanic as a whole is beyond salvaging and should be scrapped.
---
If that is in fact what it did I'd be fine with it, but it doesn't.  It is literally just a pain in the ass for no good reason.
---
I’m just wondering, I didn’t hear him say that he wanted new players to quit, he just said that hs ppl might get shit on. How does that translate
---
Nah, you MTC just asks for an even fight and then blobs you when you agree to it.
---
I agree, but this is CCP we're talking about.  Walk it back and fix it, then reintroduce it.
---
This is a scenario. Do you have difficulty with reading comprehension?
---
&gt;I do believe the nullbloc entities are a large stakeholder in eve as a game
---
This is the issue. Gobbins does not represent the *membership* of large null blocs, which make up a majority of the playerbase, with this statement. He represents the *leadership* of these large null blocs, which are a tiny minority of the playerbase who, on the whole, seem to be just fine with these changes.
---
*drifters headshot fc for you*
---
If you don't pay "real money" to play and CCP is seeding the market with Plex that no one has "paid real money" for. This is exactly how it works.
---
While yes it would be possible. It has the downside of turning the game into a job. For example. A month of subscription is worth about 1B isk. It is reasonable for a 1yr old character to make 20m isk per hour in high sec. 
---
So 50 hours of game play to earn your monthly sub.
---
&gt;Then you fail to realise that any change which actually disrupts the status quo will result in the same amount of playerbase salt. So pick 1, 2 or don’t whinge at all.
---
This really needs to be underscored. EVE needs radical change to shake up the unsustainable rut it's set into. And all radical change is going to result in this same whining and crying from nullbloc leadership which has spent the better part of the last decade taking advantage of this rut to settle themselves in comfortably at the expense of wider player enjoyment. Of course they're going to complain for a while. Eventually the game will improve, the meta will shift, and things will get back on track.
---
More like 1% of the game.
---
IDK, do what you want too.
---
Your conclusion regarding the outcome of these mechanics needs refining
---
Why does EVE have to be *hard*?!
---
Settle down, Anakin.
---
Are you saying you think 1% of players are in nullsec or is this you not realizing it impacts more than just goons?
---
The issue is a lot of people don’t oppose it. The reason I do however is that they advertise the game as “a story created by the players” not “lol npcs burn your hard earned shit git gud”
---
I just don't see that happening. Also, seeing as this is a mechanic set in motion by surprise with no input (not really something I'm against by the way), I foresee the remainder of the development/evolution/revealing-of-phases as possibly being surprise as well. Again, not really against it as long as it happens quickly
---
Fair enough. I had a braindead moment and forgot that holes don't properly populate unless warped to.
---
Still doesn't make WH space untouchable, as he implies.
---
You mean supers. There's still caps in WHs.
---
Only time active shield tank is worth it for PVP is when the ship has a bonus to rep amount of has t2 resists Cus you have to choose between ulituty like web scram and cap booster, and more tank... decent Hull reps would certainly not be op when considering 60% resists
---
&gt; CCP is seeding the market with Plex that no one has "paid real money" for.

Well, the most feasible way would be to use the great deal they are having now pony up 25 earth moneys and buy a star pack, that's 2 months of Omega, + almost 2 more if you sell the MCTS that come with it.  
---
If that's not an option, exploration. Before Alpha accounts were a thing, if I ran out of ISK and had no disposable income, I'd just roll a new trial account, and then I had 2-3 weeks to learn skills and make ISK. Newer failed to make enough isk to Plex my main. While my exploration skills trained, I'd roam active lowsec systems in a warpcore stabbed Magnate looting anything I saw and salvaging all t2 wrecks, pretty good money too. Use D-scan too, a lot of free shit laying around, expensive drones that you can combat probe and scoop, and now even unanchored citadels. If the citadel is named just 'Astrahus' or 'Raitaru' on dscan, insead of system name - name, it's unanchored and free to take. https://i.imgur.com/jsCCQQ6.jpg

You are missing the point of the whole thing.
---
Theres no evidence that CCP is seeding plex.
---
No, I mean caps. Not bringing them into C4 and lower systems is one of the reasons I like C4 space. 
---
Granted, you can always build them in-system, but at least then there are still fewer than just flying them willy nilly and you're limited so subcaps for roaming. 
---
I love subcaps. 
---
I just wish all drone mechanics worked the way fighters do.
---
I'm saying that it seems like only players involved in leadership or administration of null powers seem to have their panties in a twist over this, and they represent maybe 1% of the population of EVE. Most linemembers I've heard from just could not give two shits.
---
Have you done PI? Planetary Interaction? This takes a bit to setup but can be done minutes a day. I have them run for 24 hrs then just redo them daily. Once a week I'll haul. I have 15 planets over 3 accounts making some decent isk. 
---
I also run level 4 missions with a Cerberus. I use salvage drones and loot everything. Get good isk from NPC bounties and then use loyalty points to buy faction ammo and sell on the market. 
---
It's fun for me... for now. I have been solo since I came back.
---
There is also NPC 'sov' already, they just don't do much with it. Delve has blood raider space, for example. I don't think anyone would care if there was some sort of NPC event in NPC space.
---
No, but you seem to have a problem with writing clear and understandable sentences.
---
That wasn't the fc of the fleet.
---
The fc was in a monitor, but that wasn't the fc.

---
Ok but you didn’t need to ruin my joke man
---
When does this sale end anyway?
---
I'm fine with surprise implementation if what they implemented actually worked, but CCP has shown repeatedly that they are completely out of touch with the player-base which is why they created the CSM in the first place.  CCP will do whatever they want but that doesn't mean the players just have to accept it.
---
1.) That's going to happen anyways. CCP can't market their game to save their lives, much like they can't make merchandise that people are willing to throw money at them
---
2.) This hurts smaller, less coordinated groups in null more. It's going to lead to people quitting in the long term. People arent going to say, "Hey, I heard NPCs are attacking and i want to come back and defend X alliance space while getting nothing from it"
---
3.) I unsubbed all my accounts and haven't logged in since goons went back to delve months ago (6+?). I don't get paid by CCP so I'm not really going to put any effort into suggesting anything. I'm a customer and atm the product isn't worth my time or money.
---
I do keep up with it and with the people I know incase that changes. I started back in 03 and still think it's the best MMO out (the bar is exceptionally low).
---
This is particularly amusing if you drop them on the home station of a group you’ve been harassing.
---
They still do, I learned this to my detriment trying to transfer a bunch of corpses from my sabre alt to my scimi main next to the forcefield of a pos we were bashing. Half of them wound up inside.
---
believe or not goons have some of the nicest ppl . former goon
---
Nope. Only directors in the executor Corp have control over the alliance
---
It is a slippery slope.  This only affects NS for now.  but what happens if they start hitting random structures in LS and HS?  Bad game design is bad whether it screws is all of the players or just a portion.
---
I always assumed they used plex from banned accounts to do market changes as needed.   
---
Then again they also don't have the economics guy any more so who knows....
---
😂
---
&gt;Just because it would be fun as hell.
---
I wish I were this new to not know what happened during WWB. Staying up until 3am local time playing Agar.io with friends while toasters floated around with zero resistance while Goons were jerking each other off in Saranen.
---
dude do you even fucking work out?
---
You don't have to be subbed to help eve die fyi
---
HSG: "Cool, I'm gonna start mining/ratting/whatever, which fleet is doing that?"
---
NSG: " There is none, stratop. Get in a tackle and get ready to die. Or are you a fucking Krab?"
---
Yeah... I was looking too...
---
Did you expect to resolve the deep seated, convoluted issues CCP has created with eve due to haphazard patches over the years in a few minutes?
---
We actually someone to hate on, and NCPL are top guys for letting us. We'd be as bored as  a Drifter if we had no one to war against. Oh wait, who needs NCPL anymore when we have Drifters and high sec pubbies to hate?
---
Alliance leaders are the face of much larger groups of players that are part of any alliance. It's not just hurting 1%, it puts mandatory shitty gameplay on active players that would otherwise run fleets, hunt, blow shit up, etc. It's required daily quests with no reward.
---
He's saying that most of the real human beings, rather than bots or bot aspirants, will not quit over this. I'm enjoying this, our logistics guys are workin on figuring out ways to deal with it, and frankly, this needs to get turned up to 11.
---
or thos tidi fight were it takes 3 hours to figure out you died
---
This would be where goonthink breaks down yes
---
I fought in wwb.. but personally I’m up for another war cause at this point it feels like we’re all just fighting about who mined the most in their rorq lmao
---
"  And all radical change is going to result in this same whining and crying from nullbloc leadership " Only if the changes are a complete pile of shit like the invasion event.
---
No. Just hard to learn. :)
---
we're only pre-emptively stocking our salt reserves in anticipation of the mass sperg-consumption of salt highsec is about to unleash
---
yes he fucking does, Gobbins represents whoever decides to stay in his alliance, they are lending their numbers to his voice by staying in horde, just like mine is given to mittens and other goon leaders and the line members in NC give their voices to killah and vince, just like just test give their to vily/progod and frat members give theirs to their leadership, that's how leadership works.
---
Is it fair that pve players sometimes have to deal with forced pvp? So shouldn't pvp players have to deal with forced pve? 
---
If the richest segment of Eve is crying over losing 0.002% of their wealth then something's wrong. I've seen players in high sec lose their entire savings over a few gankers. 
---
We all know this Drifter attack will end soon, so just deal with it. At least it'll end and you can carry on with your carrier ratting.
---
He's sarcastically making fun of all the posters on r/eve who claim only goons don't like the new event.
---
the look on his face: priceless :))
---
I wasn't aware of WWB either and would have thought it sounded fun too, just to see what the Imperium is really capable of. Here's a link for OP if they're curious http://evenews24.com/2017/03/14/eve-history-remembering-world-war-bee/ Hopefully that's a pretty accurate account, it's interesting stuff to read.
---
Every change that hurts big groups affects small groups. CCP can’t avoid that. If a shake-up is needed, everyone will be affected. Seeing as the game is going to fail soon anyway, and everything people work for will be irrelevant regardless, then what’s the problem?
---
I buttchug BCAAs to keep this mass. Direct to the bloodstream.
---
haha cool, this is the answer I was looking for more or less.  Does chribba still play?
---
more like let's piss off the half of the game that is the ONLY reason we ever make the news which is our only viable marketing strategy in the last 16 years. No point holding stress test events with a third party company that you publicize if all the people who would populate that test quit the game before your next event.
---
&gt; No actually, I haven’t been pinged 100 times, cause I’m not in goons (aka, I’m not an asshat). 
---
You realize it's the entirety of nullsec right, not just goon structures? Or do you just want to ensure your posting has that comfortable seat on the grr goon bandwagon b/c it helps promote the mind-nummingly sad brain philosophy that this drifter thing is good and null sec setting highsec on fire is bad?
---
&gt;Oh, now goons are going to ruin hs.
---
As I said above - it's everyone in nullsec, you fucking illiterate, pay attention.
---
Reminds me of how Osama bin Laden died soon after EVE introduced the three word character names.  Some good corpse selling going on.
---
The 5 Herons and 12 probe's I lost to explo I made a bit of isk, but always focused on relic sites. I never thought about searching for wrecks and salvaging. Thanks for the tip!.
---
No I am still discovering and surprising myself every day. As long as there are real hardcore mmo players out there I think eve will be fine
---
yes it's pretty clear you do
---
What they need is to find new ways for null bears to get out of their cap blobs and get back into small fleet sub-cap engagements.
---
It in fact punishes a large alliance for living in and developing its space.
---
Join the channel "Haulers Channel" for some advice on moving your items safely. A tayra is the opposite of safe unless your entire cargo is worth &lt;50m.
---
My optimism is showing
---
given the numbers in 0.0 alliances per dotlan records and the number of accounts that CCP has admitted are active, null accounts for around 20-25% of the active playerbase. You think 30k people online at peak time is low traffic drive the null players out of the game and see how much fun it is with only 22-23k people at peak.
---
What sort of arbitrary line in the sand is that? We have 5000+ people in just 80 systems, should we spread out on 5 alliances in one region just because you don't like one alliance name on a whole region?
---
“ I have too much empty space and too many structure to defend against npc fleets. Waaaah!”
---
adapt or collapse under the weight of your own gluttony.
---
ITT: People thinking it's just goons and not having the additional brain cell to realize the entirety of 0.0 is coming like a high-octane gas fueled wild fire to set ablaze the dumpsters that are your highsec ivory towers.
---
Sorry I don't speak second class citizen
---
I haven't logged in and played actively since the event started because fuck dying in my shiny shit on some random gate because godlike NPC's insta pop me. &lt; goon line member.
---
Also reduce the cycle time. 24 secs on a large t2. Honestly only ever used a hull repper once. It took so long I just paid the bill instead. Do they still make that insanely loud noise?
---
I really miss the corp adverts
---
That is the route I'm looking at doing. (Level 4 missions)  Eventually, once I can fit into this drake fit I found.  
---
PI is another interesting choice, I did that on my omega clone and it still has the skills for it,  I'll want to do that on my indy toon anyway, just because the things I want to build require things from PI.
---
And Keepstars.
---
So your 1-2 account mouthbreathers can own titans.
---
It should be punishing shoving 40k people into a single region. Seeing as goons are whining.. success?
---
highsec is the best place to harvest tears
---
I want, what you want :)
---
Because their only interaction with other players is through undefended structure bashes and hit and runs on their ratters.
---
Yup, it's a retard.
---
Nope, he thinks it only affects alliance leadership and not line members. Wasn't talking about people quitting at all. This is just voicing opinions on what comes off to me as a clever idea poorly executed. 
---
Have them randomly attack systems, have them be somewhat remotely killable with something besides a structure, that kind of thing. If we have to shoot rats at least let us take a fleet out and get some entertainment for our people.
---
The problem is what I stated in the first comment. 
---
CCP: "Build an empire" 
---
Also CCP: *spawns endless NPCs that kill empire unless you spend your game time killing them with no reward*
---
If there is an actual point to it, I hope for the people still playing, it comes sooner than it took to fully implement citadels that they wanted players to build an empire with.
---
my hero
---
He went out of his was to tell people to not manipulate the Plex market because all you fucking idiots depend on it for monthly game time.
---
You dense motherfucker....”NOTE: I used the word intended, not saying they don’t have the right to” .... I already answered that question in the original comment you replied to (when I made the comment) because I knew some idiot with a stick up their ass would say this. I personally dont care one way or another being that I am in Horde myself, but the fact remains I doubt the game was INTENDED for one entity (in this case Corp/Alliance) to own such a large part of space. Please read before bitching
---
If this wasn't highsec and multiples of the same corpse i'd guess a fleet got bombed/bosoned on a gate
---
why do you idiots think goons are the only one on board with burning highsec?
---
You can still build an empire, but maybe it needs to be smaller if you want to prevent rats chewing it to pieces in the places you aren’t defending.
---
Maybe quit goons and go to space that's less populated.
---
This event is what eve needed. There was 0 risk and game breaking rewards in null. Now, null if finally balanced with the appropriate risk. Drifters need more buffing imo but for now, we can watch more and make sure we document all their weaknesses.
---
That we need to shift schedule our gunners for citadels for content at this point no one wants do. 
---
It's not fun, it's not engaging and it's a royal pain in the ass that has no end in site. And every null sec group agrees. 
---
It doesnt target bots, its doesnt target low power citadels, it's just there, being a pain that we cant stop from respawning. There is no win conditions for the content.
---
Instead of unsubbing, people should put in petitions to have their accounts frozen. (Yes, you can do that.) That way it's instant so they can see why you did it. But even better, if you have omega time, when you unfreeze your accounts, you don't have to worry about plexing accounts and all the headaches with that.
---
I don't know why you're down voting, active players in 0.0 per dotlan are around 150 thousand, active players per CCP are between 500k-600k.  They released the numbers if you go look for them the math isn't hard.
---
Moon mining is - if you are interested your welcome to come out and try my moon. I'll buy the ore off you. PM me
---
Why, because you personally think I should?
---
Jokes on them, they blued alliance that holds major production and trading citadels in Perimeter.
---
This is some of the most deluded bullshit I've ever seen. Burn highsec to the ground? How? It's thousands of npc stations that you cant attack. Thousands of players you'd have to wardec almost individually. This is a fucking game and these guys think they exert actual power over a fake world. I welcome it, it would/will be funny.
---
I heard it detracts from intelligence, I see that study was correct
---
I am an active credit card subscriber on all 4 of my accounts, and I always have been. Maybe you should stop making stupid assumptions based on wild ass guesses.
---
How are you losing so many? Make sure you follow the basic rules  
---
Only do sites if you are alone in local. Well eccept in wormholes, there you just pray and spam dscan.    
---
Travel in and out of nullsec through wormholes. Thera is the most convenient. http://www.eve-scout.com/  
---
Don't just sit at celestials, make midwarp bookmarks and sit there, aligned. If someone starts combat probing you, bail.  
---
Look at the map for active players in space, explore in the emptyest places you can find.
---
Adapt or die
---
Do you have a clear vision?
---
It's not about wealth dude. Being forced to chase OP npcs around for 1-2 hours a day when I could be doing litteraly anything else that rewards me is just a stupid mechanic.
---
I would love to see your reaction to the drifters if you had to do at least an hour of chores before you could play the game lol
---
And no you can't just drop carriers on the drifters.
---
And you don't disappoint by believing everything you read on the internet.
---
Can I be your friend?
---
I've not met a single nullsec player who likes this mechanic, wtf are you on about
---
You know this mechanic will only force them to be more compact. Opposite of what you want
---
Can't play the game without delving into the community. I don't wanna be loading around hi sec and leave in 7 days
---
Wealth and activity
---
Yawn try harder
---
If it wasn't intended then the galaxy would not be split into neat little chunks called regions! "Oh here's this 12Ly diameter cluster of systems you can cover with one supercap umbrella. Oh and there's another 12Ly diameter cluster of systems you can cover with one supercap umbrella. And between these two clusters there are like 2 regional gate pairs".
---
This was the course of a few years. I lost 12 probes when I started around 2014-2016 (probally more) I lost 5 herons a month or so ago since I've started back.  
---
Alot of it is because I don't have time to wait for a system that is unoccupied and if I do, the RNG gods are not in  my favor.  
---
There is still alot I need to learn though, that Curse that caught me a few days ago helped me realize that.
---
So I've learned lmao
---
remember when you took some bullshit reading/literature class in college b/c it was required even though you're majoring in something completely unrelated and you had to do 1-2 hours of homework every night b/c it made up 40% of your grade? Drifters are that.
---
I didnt know this was a thing until now.. i lament the time lost.

---
Doesn't impact me at all
---
I was at one point in the pisshole that is Unspoken. Just too lazy to change it.
---
How ?
---
You could put some effort in and do something you enjoy with smaller groups, or try your hand at starting you own. Eve is what you make of it. Don't be a lazy App Champ.
---
There is still zero risk for people abusing it to the max, the bitters. The regions are very well known
---
But they are not spawning there. Similarly, they are not addressing the citadel spam. I believe this is a very valid criticism of the event.
---
Nah... Eve is fine.. Fine enough to think about the release date of wow classic..  Now gimme the downvotes :*
---
Gww CCP. Gww NC/Pw. Gww Dwiftews. Gww HS.
---
I guess NS entities awe fwee to gwass/take ovew HS/wS as much as dey want to, because de game does awwow it. But pewhaps it's time to be wess ignowant as to de actuaw weasons of why dey wouwd be doing it.
---
Spoiwew: It's not to get back at CCP by scwewing ovew de entiwety of HS, and as cewtain Goon membews have put it: to punish de game/CCP by causing HS pwayews to unsub.

Ok the other 29,999 then? You honestly think the vast majority aren't buying plex with isk? 
---
Maybe you should stop making assumptions based on wild ass guesses?
---
RIP karma, if you care about that sort of thing.
---
You assume said alliance will not be participating in the fun.  That's kind of the point, push everyone to perimeter and choke off the market.
---
He actually scored about even . I'm amazed.
---
&gt;haven't played in a year or two  
---
&gt;has great insight in how to deal with nullsec
---
gtfo
---
Stop with your logic.
---
How?
---
&gt;This entire event made me wonder if CCP has hit some sort of data metric.
---
Pondering,
---
&gt;IDK just a thought.
---
Stands for I don't know just a thought I've been pondering.
---
Looks like goons are in full retard defense mode.
---
They aren't hitting the empty space. They aren't hitting low power citadels or following it up on timers. They aren't hitting the afk ratters or bots or miners.
---
Your statement is completely untrue. Stop being so dumb.
---
They aren't hitting outlying systems. 
---
With null powers immediately coming to a ceasefire, even if the structures they ref aren't going to be blown up.
---
This resolves NOTHING. Don't be a stereotypical idiot of a hisec pubbie. Think it through.
---
You said yourself you haven't played in a year or two.  Since you aren't a paying customer, why should CCP listen to you instead of those who are?
---
Pretty clearly obvious that the IQ in null sec is very very low. Or they may just be made entirely of salt.
---
Go back and re-read the original post.
---
you are completely oblivious to the fact that **ALL** of nullsec is about to shit on highsec
---
They're hardly affecting the krabbing if you know the systems to avoid. Those are also the systems null powers themselves advocate to avoid. They ask you to spread out and krab in less active systems. 
---
The losses are minor, with insurance and salvage and looting if blown up stuff,  the losses overall to null are even going to be more small.
---
You're not making any sense or you don't understand the mechanics of the drifter invasion.
---
*whoooosh*
---
If I'm cloaked, how do people find me in J-space?
---
Sorry, playing a week, exploring for 1 day.
---
its clear you are not in nullsec, no matter the size (small alliances) have it the same. 
---
I challenge you to go to nullsec with your friends and take any system (there are a lot free). Place the structures you need to survive and see.
---
Then talk.
---
I should guild you for this. He kept posting pictures in the TiS discord all weekend and for the love of me I couldn't figure out why the suit looked simultaneously too big and too small.
---
I said some.

Oh hey, it's you again. +1
---
He was at the Royal Ascot which is black tie? white tie? Whatever the dress code is to meet the Queen basically.
---
That's a pretty good analogy actually
---
That’s not an answer
---
Drifters aren't hitting major bot regions of low power citadels is a very valid criticism. This is where the game is broken. And what CCP does is the opposite, it rewards botters by shitting on active players.
---
Then hard core exploration, fly around in a Zeguma/Blackglass fit Astero, Cary a mobile depot with cargo scanners, AB/MWD for catches.
---
So you want people to be able to tell you what ships you can fly. Yeah, I'm sure that's a fun mechanic.
---
You clearly don’t get what I’m saying. This is exactly what I’m saying is the problem.
---
Big empires have more space than they need just because they can have it and no one else can, By having a huge military complex, they can force anyone out if a small group tries to come in unless they bend the knee.
---
This has been a problem for years, and CCP is trying to come up with reasons for the biggest groups to not have huge swathes of space that they don’t really need.
---
Lol gsf already have a well working counter but this "Invasion" is just cheap whack-a-mole you Run around, gut those ships down with citadel weapons and run to the next, rinse and repeat.  Honestly i think the Imperium has it figured out way better already but we would rather fight human enemies. I already hear people taking about quitting the game because this contend is flat out stupid
---
Like what 2 hours and a ups push commit?
---
US uniformly uses NFPA 70, it just recently was updated iirc, like 16 or 17 i think?
---
How well does it hold together?  Guessing its not a single peace. Otherwise I personally would drill holes on the top and hang it from the ceiling with with fishing string
---
CCP introduced empire building by fueling rorqs to stupid levels, it's still stupid with panic, no other ship gets that. This is one way to fix it. Rorquals can afk and so scale well, again this is something that can be fixed.
---
CCP introduced unlimited afk mining and ratting anomalies that do not really scale exponentially against areas mined allowing players to hole up and farm away a region. Again, this is something CCP can fix.
---
The above are ideas acknowledged by null empires and their CSM candidates. 
---
What drifters are doing is only impactiving a very vibrant and active human players.
---
It's not impacting rorwual mining or afk mining or botting or citadel spamming, it's only forcing null empires to be slightly more compact, they will still be able to easily project power across regions. It doesn't change anything.
---
They can’t, they might have seen you splash in though, if they are in a fast ship they might try to fly towards you in an attempted to decloak you.
---
It's just two halves. The center core is pretty sturdy, and the outside parts have some decent support but they are flexible.
---
This is next level meta.
---
You guys can't handle rats, how do you imagine you're going to take on actual players?
---
yes and i'm making fun of him for missing the point
---
Yeah all the null blocs are sending gunners and forming fleets out for these.
---
The reason most of the reeing is goon based is cause they appear to have had a much higher occurrence of these drifter fleets compared to the other blocs.
---
Drifters don't impact the best ores, mining sites, afk ratting or citadel spams unless you're in very active system. Drifters are only hitting handful of the more active systems. Null ratters will adapt and go to more outlying systems or less ratted systems. It will only make ratting and mining more evenly spread out.
---
So, first understand the mechanics of how drifters work and then meme about it.
---
It's not about being salty, you don't even know what you're talking about, it just reinforces the stereotype that highseccers are pubbies...
---
I agree they need to address this, The problem is it’s already too late for addressing those changes alone to have impact. Every man and his dog has a super cap because CCP introduced this lousy system and didn’t fix it in time. 
---
The inertia is huge and would take far too long for meaningful improvements to take effect; by then the game will be almost dead anyway based on current rates of decline.
---
Happy microphone day
---
To burn hs you just have to destroy industry and throw it back like it is 2005 again.
---
Don't and donate to Shriners Hospital for children &lt;3

Just get them into gsf then lol

But we dont have huge swats of land. we live in delve 1 region and that is is.
---
*I get it's grr goons, fuck subhuman goons, goons touched me in the bad places and now i can sperg. Hate goons they are not people, more hate also hate. Hate so much you are blind to reason.*
---
*Its fine, goons are bees anyway and they don't care. But we will come and fuck hisec if this continues. Cause if the company treats ALL nullsec this bad, we are going to make sure you who hate, us suffer too.*
---
**If bees die we are taking you with us.**
---
most of the people I play with subscribe, there are of course a few uber rich who plex everything but they are the exception.
---
I'm not sure what your questions "How?" was aimed at -
---
if you are asking "How" then in terms of gameplay we are going to put pressure on everything that makes highsec tick and all the activities you guys normally participate in are going to see massive increase of hostile interference
---
&gt; I renovated one that had a 12x12 hand hewn rim joist
---
I actually got invited to come up here to Duluth to work on one of the really old houses out east.  They're all 1890's builds, this one was like the first dentists house and I was going to be doing wood restoration and remodeling, this thing was like all oak for its entire first floor with huge ornate crazy dental style crown, 12' ceilings on each floor, full huge beautiful built in shelves surrounding a mammoth hearth,  and big ass 12x12 rough hewn timbers (2) acting like a modern day I-beam would in a more current home.  Actual 2x12 floor joist, all cut from the forests around Duluth.
---
I love shit like that.  You get into the bones of a house like that and the craftsmanship these guys had with fairly archaic tools is unreal.
---
You have to decloak when you hack the cans in exploration sites.
---
The truth hurts.
---
Why?  the perimeter citadels fall under a profit sharing agreement between goons, test, and phorde.  All of whom are apparently going to participate.
---
WHY DO THINGS EXIST
---
Ahh so D-scan when hacking cans. Thanks!
---
&gt;I haven't played in a year or two at this point
---
*Yet i talk.*
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;Wait, Reddit has multiple level quotes?
---
No NPC's can be dscanned, and they haven't been scannable for like 12 years.
---
The 'pos code' they have been working on removing for the last what 8 years is now able to be removed on sisi from the looks of it.
---
Caring about karma in the subreddit that has the most downvotes for it's sub size on Reddit lmao
---
This is why I live in a static null sec, it help me to keep some sanity
---
The real Mattani need to get Laid. I have seen his face in The Meta Show. I get the impression that he only get hand-pu$$y. Which Explained a lot, as to why he is so butthurt with CCP.
---
.
---
It’s not goons, it’s the entire blue donut, and the incentive for a blue donut, that is the problem.
---
It's all part of a plan; it Ould disgust you from docking therefore creating emerging content
---
One results in a killmail that someone logged in to get, bought a ship for, and put something at risk to do, which will will possibly result in more content for someone else later.
---
The other is an RNG death that ruined his roam, ended the potential for a PVP fight, and generally just added nothing to the game.
---
Fact: 90% of new players quit the game while in high sec...
---
\*scene starts with a bloody figure aproaching OP\*
---
*Grabs OP's hand while standing on the rubbles of hisec citadels from the last great war of Eve.* 
---
''I too am ok with that. ''
---
*Screams are heard in the background as a mother orca and her hulk children are beset by Miniluv wielding spiked clubs.*
---
*Stares into the artificial sunset created by a drifter ship.*
---
***Let it end.***
---
To actually get to you they need to scan down the anomaly you are in, or warp to you via combat probes, so look out for them on dscan, but someone could have always scanned down the site before you showed up, and be able to warp right to you.
---
Well you should dscan even when cloaked, so that you see if there's any activity, like ships, probes and such. Even if you see sleeper wrecks it means someone has been in the hole recently, player ship wrecks obviously mean there's some PvP activity going on. Also, check the wormhole in https://zkillboard.com sometimes you can see that it's clearly always camped.
---
you need to turn on your grr gun translator first
---
Any resources to find an alpha-friendly group that you can recommend? I just started playing and would like to join one.
---
The Monitor loss I get this loss though not so much..... [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77565171/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77565171/)
---
Making high sec safer and easier than before led to a population drop. Maybe, if goons manage to pull this off, we'll gwt an increase in the number of players will rise again.
---
Wait, really? Got a source for that?
---
Explaining the rationale behind your suggestions could take hours, but listing the actual suggestions should not even take minute**s**, you should be able to do it in 30 seconds.
---
So people lose a percentage on their refining values? Oh man, that's devastating. Anybody who caves to that shit doesn't need to be playing this game anyway.
---
When you hate goons so much, you have to post subcap losses to NPCs to feel good.
---
All's good hope all is well with you too.
---
We were quite happly punching each other. Yet all wars had to stop because pve &gt; pvp. 
---
Before you screech a blob is not pvp, let me remind you that in the last tribute war we glassed a region. 
---
That is we wiped all structures from it, all 484+ lost track of them. 
---
Yes it was lame. But players &gt; Op Npcs with haxors mechanics.
---
Test vs Frat have been fighting over 5 months, haaard. And while Frat was fighting hard to barely cling to their successful defense they lose key cyno jammers to drifters. 
---
Pandemic Horde was fighing goons as hard as they could.
---
Other wars, that i do not know much about were going on the russian side.
---
There was no blue donut.
---
Yet drifters came, and forced us into Wow like pve.
---
Then the donut. And the donut comes for CCP.
---
search for a corp here: https://eve-corps.com :)
---
you mean 'a' goon
---
Look at the Gila. Does great on level 4s.  Not sure if it was in the patch changes though. Haven't paid attention. Invention is always another option. But do the research. Some items aren't worth it. I did rapid light missile launcher IIs for a while and they sold like hotcakes.
---
Why imagine when you can just do it?
---
Original post also makes a statement with no evidence.
---
Can someone quickly introduce me to what the real mittani shit talk was about? I'm looking to get, like, ankle deep into this, so don't try too hard, just main points, thank you.
---
Haha. Hour of chores? Too funny. You could always go somewhere else? No one forcing you to do that. Adapt or die. It hasn't even been a week and you're salty.
---
No, it's just so much fun to see goons all whining about drifters.
---
Ok so why was someone, that was not an fc, in monitor then ?
---
Somekind of bait ?
---
Thats a honest question?
---
Imagine burn jita + hulkageddon + mission ganking + all HS citadels going away and that's just the tip of the iceberg.
---
&gt; Stands for I don't know just a thought I've been pondering.
---
It does not specify which statements are your assumptions and which are facts you use as a base. So you may think you was clear but you wasn't.
---
Wish there was more content on this board that wasn't just Goonsmash or Dinowanging.
---
" but listing the actual suggestions should not even take minutes, " Its like you've never played eve before.
---
Oh no. Extra work you have to do to succeed... that was so horrible. Hate to break it to you, but that's Eve.
---
This is an hell of a hel.
---
&gt;Wish there was more content on this board that wasn't just Goonsmash or Dinowanging.
---
it was a Corm fleet. like I mean if I linked one dead Corm. Who gives a fuck. More of a meme of salty goons because of their out "tactics"
---
I never said that. Where did I say that? Besides don't alliance have fleet doctrines? My point was that cap blobs are stupid and small fleets are more fun. We need more small fleet objectives. Not more cap crap.
---
TIL one guy is all of goons.
---
just browse r/eve, thats best thing to do atm
---
Quite happy? Steadily declining subscriptions and participation rates beg to differ. 
---
And I don’t think CCP are intending this as a way of PVE replacing PVE. The drifter spam is to create a chink in the armour of a region for Group A. That’s when Group B can take advantage of Group A having to defend and either hit Group A’s anti-PVE fleet, or hit their structure if they don’t form up.
---
Good lord man, what have you done
---
:psyduck:
---
Man... this is an alt corp purge.
---
Fuck, you guys are trying hard and digging deep these last few days.
---
Oh I'm an autistic krabber, but now I'm _highly_ motivated to come piss in your cheerios until you fucking howl.
---
instead of fixing what we have been shouting for them to fix, rorquals, citadel mechanics they chose to burn all of nullsec.
---
We spent years to build that. If someone would be to burn them **let it be players** not NPC.  They broke the sandbox with a blatant use of dev hax (that is how i see the OP drifters).
---
read the CSM minutes for yourself. i am not talking out of my ass. in no order:

etc. i cant be bothered to link them all.
---
I tried to say this a few weeks ago, and got told I "didn't understand diplomacy" or some shit.  
---
No, what I don't understand is why they're purposefully fucking up NPSI as everyone understood it to be for years. Nor why they won't listen to all the feedback they're getting saying just that.  
---
Fucking stubborn ass nerds.
---
&gt; Without the, you know, actual military genius
---
his alliance is bigger than yours
---
What? It's was a competition to see how long it would take them to notice, if at all. A month, it took goons a month to figure out who sold the molok after they noticed darkness had one that wasn't the "Only molok outside goons" that was for sale for 500b at the time. Also, goon directors check "0x7f" and his alts finished contracts, dude was selling them public for a while on the open market. Can't let a goonfucker try and be too edgy and try to out shitpost me now :)
---
I’m not saying CCP haven’t screwed up, they put the player base in this situation. Sure they should change Rorqs and Citadel mechanics. But that alone is probably too late.
---
Unfortunately it seems doubtful that they can keep creating incentives for the players themselves to prevent stagnation. Every attempt at this by CCP has failed, so they’re trying something new. 
---
I’m not even that confident that it will work that well, but at least they’re showing some balls.
---
It's like you really really want EVE to be this ~deep and complicated game~ because that makes you, a player, look so smart by proxy.
---
Gas
---
And when I thought Mittani's speech had been the most cringe thing in all this drifter shenanigans...  
---
Gobbins: hold my beer...
---
1-2 hours a day? I've been running around gunning shit for over 6 hours today, over 4 hours yesterday. It NOT fun. It's fucking boring, annoying and monotonous and to cap it off, you actually loose isk doing it due to ammo costs as the drifters drop fuck all and when they do, you don't have time to loot it because there are 3 other structures being hit in the same system or 5 jumps away you need to react to
---
sounds fun
---
I thought goons control ccp. Jeez, reddit is confusing ;D
---
hi it's me, your friend
---
Adapt or die?
---
Why not introduce a hull-repair logi with huge bonuses to repair amount, cycle time and capacitor need. Would be really nice as this year's AT prize ship if there was one.
---
Nah it’s usually a second anchor or something lol
---
Oh thank God someone else remembered..
---
For what it's worth, nobody talks about those anymore though.
---
Maybe it's because by itself it's not something actually worth talking, and discussing any further implications would just be speculations at this point. But we do have something hot that distracted people as well, that's a fact.
---
uwon't
---
It's the weird offspring of eve and runescape.
---
every empire that spread so far that they cant respond in time  deserves to get reduced (to clarify i mean not destroyed i mena **reduced**) to the size they can deffend.
---
It's not fair as a customer that people with bigger ships or more numbers can kill me when I'm exploring/plexing/ratting, etc...
---
Why do people think that this event should fix things?
---
I see it as a way for CCP to remind nullblocks that there's always a bigger fish and shake up their comfort zone a little.
---
The response so far has been hilarious with high level Corp executives crying like a noob who just got his freighter gatecamped in Jita.
---
Thanks for the content CCP!
---
Odd flex, Bro, but whatevs...
---
WHAT DID YOU DO???

---
Take my upvote for effort. But, for an alt that skillplan is much too broad. Why not seperate astero/scanning toon and general PvP toon for the beginning? For a sabre pilot I also consider T2 autocannons of low importance. Of course they are nice but I'd rather give other skills higher priority. Regarding the format, I prefer "skillplans" in table format which show what skill to aim for. Imho much more helpful than stuff to copy and paste.
---
"oh your home is being bashed? Just move lul"
---
Yep, I agree. Especially as I pretty much only live in citadels currently - to start they could just do different environments for ECs and Refinaries. And eventually tie it in to whatever skin system they come up with.
---
Don’t tell me you didn’t scoop them all up into the cargo hold.
---
do you even have an eve account?
---
All null empires were gearing up towards huge wars, the propaganda was there, the level of reee was max. 
---
We all wanted a huge blood boths. The setup of bloodbaths is contingent on one side fucking up and a third showing up unannounced. That is on the players to do. The players were working on it...
---
We too felt the stagnation, its why so many wars started, why we hate each others guts via propaganda and ree. Hell the content on this subreddit is basically null sperg.
---
 Anyway this is impossible now. 
---
And even if drifters mechanics are fixed we prob wont see  new war fronts start as the people we trust and depend on are dead tired. They are people with family with work with a real life.
---
We were gut punched in null as we were running.
---
Let me make it clear drifters do not:
---
\-kill lowpower citadels
---
\-kill botters
---
\-have a mechanic to detect and fight them back like an incursion
---
\-give rewards
---
\-respect in game mechanics.
---
Drifters do:
---
\-appear at random
---
\-insta lock you when you jump a gate and blap the shit out of you (see bjornbee twich), you and the fleet you came on before you sometimes enter warp in a ceptor.
---
Look i am tired i could append the list more. I dont care anymore about this discussion. All i want now is to hurt someone. 
---
***\*Looks at hisec. Logs in alts. Fuck this. Let the end come.***
---
I hope this satisfies the need for salt.
---
Good unsub and quit then. Good to see bees go
---
How about players who hold structures will pay to those who defend it?
---
Seem like a perfectly fine solution.
---
This is in your corp/alliance interests to keep space safe, so they have to pay.
---

---
Oh God I know one.. Possibly two of these people
---
Hey man I know it sucks to see the game we like go in a bad direction, but we’ve only seen the start of it. Maybe CCP are doing some initial testing and will refine it more. 
---
Either way they’re trying to take action and maybe it will fail but if we’re lucky they’ll keep working on it to get things back to how they felt ten years ago. Here’s hoping.
---
Your service doesn't get rate limited if someone else happens to be pulling data for the same account at the same time. It just isn't how any of this works.

---
Mittanni is crying like a  child because ccp is punishing people for getting to big. So hes declaring war on high sec and trying to get everyone to boycott ccp
---
Well, appearently Mittens and Gobbins share a channel now, so I guess we can expect more of this
---
Sweet model!
---
Can you actually apply paints to that \[as in: when you do that, does the paint hold on the material?\]
---
you being in idea doesnt show at all
---
That doesn't look too bad, TBH.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Difficult? Yes, but far from impossible. The difficult part is to gather enough knowledge about the game to not get stuck in low income activities and find the ways to accelerate your progression.
---
One of the best ways to make money is incursions. Unfortunately you need a blinged battleship to join them and it takes months for an alpha to get in one.
---
The obvious shortcut is to buy Plex with real money and use that to pay for Omega and buy skill injectors.
---
The other way is to get in a Corp.
---
If you are poor and want to play solo, yes it will be very hard to reach the level of established players. You will get there eventually but you will need a lot of patience.
---
One additional note is I see many people answering that skill is superior to fit and knowledge about the game beats any t2 fit.
---
Those people are right, however, the defining attribute of new players is that they don't have this knowledge or skill while veteran are likely to have acquired it over the years in addition to better ships and fits.
---
I too make assumptions and pretend like i'm not a Lemming and do Le Grr Goons.
---
My entire post was made on the assumption of a brainless Super Ratter, not on Leet Renters which are suddenly not so Leet anymore after seeing some zKill stats. 
---
And yes, apparently to your surprise the Inhib gets anchored when the Super is just about to land on-grid, the cyno isn't prelit before it initiates warp, not like it matters beause  pubbie coalition member #2343 doesn't think the cyno is Hostile.
---
Honestly it's not very impressive. There are so many options available. If goonswarf can affect highsec thats a problem with highsec not a testament to the power of goonswarm. I would honestly welcome it.
---
We have seen no reply from them and if past events are a standard they are getting worse at communicating. 
---
No post no press release, just a lol working as intended (doubt) . They  bypassed CSM on this and any idiot with 2 brain cells would have told them exactly what would happen.
---
anyway if you have not seen a response from ccp. please post the link if you have it, i already typed a fucking novel and not trolled that hard. this is unusual.
---
Yes, I usually use a primer and then a coat of finish paint. Some people sand and then paint, I prefer not to due to the labor involved even on small models.
---
It's mostly the awkward picture angle I think.
---
I missed structure bashing ever since coming back to Delve. Thanks Malory for the fleet!
---
I really think instead of drifters it should be fleets from the local pirates.
---
Maybe it is drifters at the moment because the pirates give bounty.
---
The payout from defending your structures is keeping them and the benefits they offer (refining, production, etc.)
---
Malory Wild Goes Wild would be the better title.  Cripes.
---
Hey, this 20 people from pl 5years ago did some shit. Ergo we are completely justified in our hipocrisy of emulating them, granted, hugely compensating lack of skill with numbers. While also shitting on them for doing that years ago, when they still player and could do that.   
---
Ok
---
Yeah I know lol, I think he was trying to shittalk someone
---
Not just goons, pretty much all of nullsec
---
Bruh what
---
What do I got to hold your hand? Try using your brain.
---
Chique!
---
I love the original Her model because it looked like it was a thing-from-the-netherworld that was awoken from a deep *deep* alcohol-drug-infused hangover and next to being a bad character it was also in a very bad mood. And you just couldn’t leave good enough alone, you had to drag it into whatever misery you thought was a good idea at the time.
---
And you can’t convey that message on a device that’s bright red.
---
If you could make an Orca that size, I would want one. I’d paint it myself.
---
It's over your head brainlet.
---
&gt;Drifters didn't perfectly solve everything wrong with EVE! GRRRRR
---
CCP never said anything along the lines of this new increased aggression from Drifters being intended to address any of the problems.
---
If anything, its the players who (understandably) had misplaced their hopes and attributed their hopes and dreams to something that CCP never said was designed to fix any issues.
---
My condolences.
---
Ty. At the time I was trying to “police” a 7 year olds birthday party.
---
There is a shares and voting system in the game but it’s very controlled by corp executives. Anyone with a certain percentage of shares can initiate a vote for a new CEO among other things. It’s useful just in case the CEO goes MIA and you need to kick him out. 
---
A Corp will often divide shares between two executive members but I have never seen corps offer to give shares to regular members.
---
what
---
&gt;Thank you for finally creating a mechanic that will help to limit the size of space empires. 
---
Is it really designed to do this though? [thinking emoji]
---
Challenge this man to gladiatorial combat to decide who's superior
---
All valid observations and to me they appear correct.
---
This below is worrisome.
---
&gt;The consequence of adapt and die is that null has banded together and found a new avenue of outlet for their firepower, the high sec. Highsec players said adapt or die, a month from now, it'll be null players asking high sec players to adapt or die, the problem for highsec is, adaption has only one course: Be affiliated with a null empire.
---
Yep and that is how the game will die.
---
Perhaps CCP wants to exit from EVE ONLINE because they dont like Blackabyss or what ever they are called. Maybe they are nuking the game on purpose.
---
Its not only going to be goons.  It is going to be a large portion of NS.

Its like... by specifically telling people not to export to highsec.... they encourage them to export to highsec.

I am pretty sure that CCP will not just sit around if unsubbing HS players becomes a problem but if you think they are going to make living in nullsec easier so more people who live in highsec come back, I have bad news for you.
---
Even in wh space your not safe from us just ask hard knocks
---
Drifter food bank
---
BUT
---
There is a voting system for share holders in a corp but no such system is implemented for alliances. There’s no reason why an alliance can not create their own voting system though.
---
I'd like to see a thing but not if it takes a while to talk about.
---
Well.. I at least personally think it is. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion tho :)
---
A lot, they have a cap response fleet already in Amarr at the pricess beacon just sitting there already undocked.
---
what am I looking at here?
---
We are not evil. We had to become evil as the rest see us. Their hate made us what we are, and our refusal to give in.
---
*Looks at hisec. Let it end.Burn it all. Drown in their ashes. They reeeeeee-ed first but we shall reeeee last.*

The prophets said eve was dieing from day one. I never believed them. The little voices in my head have grown to a chorus, and i stand up and tell you all.
---
*Wars stopped. Stagnation. Suffering and hate .Destruction upon the weak. Break the wheel and their wills. Oblivion. There is nothing left to fight over. End. EVE IS KILL.*

Profit is what drives EVE and it's sandbox forward
---
Without isk there won't be krabs, without krabs there won't be hunters, same hierarchy, lowsec, nullsec and wormholes
---
what happen if ccp disables wardec? like how the made concord immortal
---
Still a temporary attempt, most HS veterans are just going to yawn and wait until you get bored.
---
inb4 drifters kill goon HQ making all the wars invalid
---
Alliances would quickly find an out-of-game system to manage Blues, then promptly be able to get around this idea. 
---
Imagine, hypothetically, if everyone could manage to keep track of who is friendly and who is not in their heads. Your proposal would do nothing. Friends and foes are concepts that don't really exist in-game. The Blue/Red system is merely a convenient tool CCP has given us.
---
Then CCP still sold Skill Injectors.
---
"We will not sell any game altering items"
---
Riiiiiight.
---
Guess who's protests don't do anything long term?
---
You are projection way too much into this. 
---
They dont follow up on timers, they dont "hunt" botters.
---
They are more of a random annoyance than a threat atm.
---
Have a look at the Creality Ender 5. I did a big Megathron on mine, and even the test print was good enough to now consider touching up and painting.

---
Otherwise, the same tired old circus with just a few clowns is in town yet again.

They aee not but wait until the fleets of eagles and bhaalgorns descend upon the forge and burn all the fortizars sotiyos and azbels to the ground.
---
Show us on the doll where actual content in the game hurt you, Aryth
---
If they think CCP will change null to make HS players come back, they are in for a surprise
---
Lmfao
---
My stance is that people are only entitled to the opinions they can defend, but sure.
---
CCP has never stated that the drifters were designed to do anything. People projected their hopes onto them and believed that the increased aggression may kill botters and reduce citadel spam, but at the end of the day, they just random NPCs that are slightly more aggressive than most.
---
To believe they are anything more than that (with the information we know currently) is foolish. I can understand why people would hope they are more than that, but it's misguided.
---
You know it's funny though because the skill ceiling In empire, particularly low is considerably higher than that of null. I'd honestly be surprised if most of the major empires will have any impact.
---
Bury Jita?
---
But what if ccp actually said what their intended purpose is?
---
How will a mechanic that encourages a large group cause large groups to break into smaller ones
---
What we need is a reset to everything but skill points and a lot lower limit to resources in null sov.
---
It would be better for Rorqual farmers too, they will still get the most minerals until they get depleted ans won't waste their entire day farming.
---
Botting would be irrelevant too.
---
boohoo; why not enjoy the ingame event for what it is, an unannounced and distinct pve event that brings changes to npc interactions. all this nonsense about killing the game is fucking childish.
---
If people quit the game over the npcs getting harder to deal with, then so be it, i'd rather the developer experiment with interactions than just let the universe rot with predictable safe experiences.
---
you can't expect people to listen to a 2 hour clip for every single CSM candidate, surely there is a summary somewhere that would be better to link to?
---
ELI5 please?  I seen this name pop up in a few channels as the butt of a joke.  Who is he and why is he a loser?

Honk Honk.

We shall see.
---
Imagine camping Jita, Amarr, and Dodixie for a week while some structures get bashed, and then everyone gets bored and goes back to krabbing.
---
That's what's gonna happen.
---
lol... I live in nullsec and yes, it's a bit annoying, but no, not enough for all this drama and whining.
---
Come to nullsec, we have:

Drifter fleets
---
24/7 cloaky campers

Yeah, turns out these can't. The ones in J-space can be though.
---
Is this the HS version of not winning fast enough?  Patience young padawan.
---
CCP hasn't said anything at all. And what I listed isn't everything wrong with Eve, there are other issues as well. 
---
Since CCP hasn't said anything and as you said it doesn't solve anything, what's the point? It's just punitive with no reasoning, if there are reasons, I'll be happy to know what they are. Heck, even it's some PvE lore or storyline related event, atleast then there is a point to it.
---
It's worrying because they are spending time and resources on these things when more important things need to be addressed.
---
Frozen corpses smell?
---
Love your videos, I watch and rewatch them all the time, thank you for the amazing content
---
Nothings going to change. People might get a little upset but more than likely CCP will just market it and it will only help the game and players.
---
Check out some of these blogs:
---
https://evebloggers.com
---
The blog scene definitely kept me going in EVE, highly recommend.  Best game I have ever played, and likely ever will.  You gotta find some peeps tho.  Just spark up random convos.  I always convo those I kill, and occasionally those I died to.  
---
WH’er btw
---
&gt; what's the point?
---
What's the point of any tee bee aytch, familam? [takes bong hit]
---
&gt;when more important things need to be addressed.
---
Yeah, like that 13th Spod rock in that Colossal that just came up again, right?
---
Just chill your tits. CCP'll probably announce something else a month from now after they've reset the Drifter AI back to normal and tries to pretend like nothing happened.
---
This guy flies caps all the time and just keeps losing them. And he never gets any better at it. He's lost something like a thousand caps and something like a dozen supers and still keeps PLEXing and undocking them. Somehow he still sucks at it despite losing probably an actual moon's mass worth of shit.
---
&gt; Maybe they are nuking the game on purpose.
---
Is this the new line of Goon spin? A couple of NPCs poking their structures and not following up on Armor timers is "nuking" the game?
---
These days the pubbies always get bored and go home to crab before the objective can be reached in HS.
---
Most of HS is linked by the NPC corp channels, they just tell each other what systems to avoid and they carry on ignoring you.
---
Top 5 in quality as well, from bottom.
---
but why?
---
why not fight each other instead of people in hisec who literally don't even know you exist?
---
You got me there pal. Have my upvote
---
There is no defending except with the citadels and maybe supers. The drifter fleet one shots most subcaps with their insane damage, instalock and frigate tracking up to 300+km. You don't even get a yellowbox to ADC in time. And yes I learned that the hard way :)
---
Holy shit man get a life. I didn't see any mumble pings for a Reddit strat op, stop word-vomiting on every thread.
---
So when we enjoying our high-efficiency isk/mineral generating mechanisms under an actually not that risky environment do we think it is "not fair"? If no, why now?
---
We don't know the way the drifters work in terms of determining systems etc.

Got a specific breakdown of each of the sizes for those structures? (i.e. of the 2449 Citadels, how many are Astras, Fortizars, Keeps, etc.)

Train a Caracal for pvp (great starter pvp ship). If you want to mine do it in a brick procurer with combat drones (bigger hold so more ISK and tanky as balls). Explo is good ISK but you'll have to fight for sites if you're in USTZ so it can get iffy on the ISK per hour.
---
Not a terrible idea for a piss up in a field though
---
Arguments stated without evidence may be refuted without evidence.
---
The thing is I have a lot of... interactions with High Sec carebears and almost every single one joins a corp/a 'better' corp that they think can defend/educate them afterwards.
---
Joining a corp is good for player retention. CCP has the numbers finally after 16 years.
---
I welcome Goons joining CODE. in improving player retention
---
For new players, do exploration.
---
It would sound complicated, but it's quite easy, just watch some videos, to get some pointers.
---
You can also ask your corpmates for easy explo fit, you don't need much training (couple of days max).
---
With all of that said, I would not recommend you not do that. You will spend time  training towards and earning isk, instead of having fun.  Especially in first few months, go around try a few different things, etc, don't be obsessed with isk. 
---
After that time you will have more of an idea of what you want to do, and how to make isk for that.

Quit being unecessarily negative your input is irrelivant to my question and outright unproductive.

quite right on the 'if', these numbers are our own personal scouting, ie we were there - numbers can fluctuate however as people get bored and take things down again.

why not ?

---
Th.... Fuckit... Smart Choice
---
Stoppp I just wanna play the game
---
You would probably end up with less alliances as they would consolidate into one main one. Well done, even more of a blue doughnut.
---
First of all, focus on what excites you, otherwise you'll get bored/burned and you will most likely quit soon.
---
Lazy PI can be a good cash injection for new players, 1 account with 3 chars with 5 planets each and all skills at 4 can get you 1 bil/month in highsec and ***quite more*** in null/whs - also depending on the effort you want to dedicate to it, but at certain point it will stop being passive income. Just don't go for some crazy short extraction cycles.
---
Lvl 4 security missions are good for start as well (just get a raven/domi). Not much cash but you can learn how fitting works.
---
Good alternative to lvl3 missions is running high sec signatures (just don't do it in highly populated areas). Scan down a site, clear it out and sometimes you can get shiny loot, more often this is better income than casual lvl4s but you can do it properly fitted cruiser.
---
Most importantly, don't get stuck on low income activities, always try to think what to do next. Whether it is ratting, PI, industry, sigs or basically anything, low, null, wormholes are better + you'll get to pew pew other people, which is by far the best entertainment EVE has to offer.
---
CRY MOAR!!!
---
Yep, she's a pretty big job!!
---
It is easier for larger entities to defend because those tend to have better coverage with citadel gunners to just delete the drifter fleet when it shows up
---
I've actually been thinking about this a little bit. Maybe we're expecting too much from the Drifters to do all the work. I mean, maybe all they're meant to do is create some random timers. If some players can follow up on a couple timers, it can put multiple structures into hull at the same time. The question then becomes, how much changes if a couple structures get killed?
---
lits be real there some really dumb ppl in eve your scam could be called scma and someone will still fall for it
---
Especially if you consider that "solo" also means that there are multiple Artemis Tyrannos on grid
---
... because of the drifters hitting their home regions none stop. Have you not listened to anything they have said? They WANT to fight each other but they can't when having to defend vs npcs all the time.
---
yikes to everything here
---
No, I am actually playing the game :)

The Astrahus that jack built.

I loved that whole trilogy so damned much.
---
Why did you go with the Cheetah ?
---
Doing the same (before this thread).
---
Makes logistics sooooo much easier. :)
---
It's a opinion dude, he didn't say it was fact. We can have opinions on what we 'think' it could be and until you have an official post from CCP explaining the drifters, you can't say it's foolish to think differently to you.
---
Yep.
---
And once they stopped recruitment scamming, they grew into an industrial powerhouse that outbuilt the people who threw them out of the North.
---
Hmmmmm.
---
maybe not while they are at work or out on a fleet. But eventually? Yes I do, Eve is not a simple game, CCP has not made simple changes, the solutions to the problems built into this game are not going to be explained in a few minutes.
---
Everyone amazed at the corpses and I'm over here like "wow, a Bellicose!".
---
&gt; + all HS citadels going away
---
You know, if they didn't have what it took to grind the north down, do you really think they have what it takes to grind all the HS citadels? Have you *seen* highsec? There's more citadels than NPC stations. A single region of highsec makes Delve look uninhabited. 
---
Even if every single one is completely undefended, that's a grind that would kill the most autistic of alliances.
---
upvote to fellow sinologist
---
I can't think of a single reason why a HS player should come back to the game because "nullsec is no longer mad at CCP, so they stay in nullsec again and leave HS doing it's thing"
---
if you think i care about reddit karma look at my comment history,
---
that feeling when you havent lived in j space for 2 years yer still know more about it than that ~wormholer btw~ guy who religiously defends wormholes on reddit.
---
like what annoys me is that people say wormholes are so hardcore true eve risk etc. when the reality is that you can stop half the people from entering your bearhole and since jspace is so lightly populated, barely anyone rage rolls c5/c6 anymore since more and more migrate to the ns static the chances of you running into a gank are so low. and thats not even thinking about the bullshit that is mjd rattles if you go that way.
---
and then theres the fact that the probe scanner window acts as a psuedo-local, "oh shit new sig in system, check if static is still up, it is, ok then someone just entered my wormhole" 
---
but yeah im just "generic nullbear karmafleet f1 monkey lolqual4life" player so idk anything about #spooky megaultra dangerous wh space#
---
Would be hilarious if retention goes up as large null blocs become more visible to newer players who then look into these groups and decide to join.
---
Since we know that the biggest issue with retention is new(er) players not joining other people and failing to find a reason to play.
---
I'd say, awesome, let's burn it all!
---
But I can.
---
I can say it's foolish to project things onto something without any real reason to believe it, and then get mad about how it's not doing the thing you projected onto it.
---
Listen you're probably new, stop comparing this to T20 and monocle gate. You look REALLY stupid.
---
I dont know about you, but im cringing at all the support this mechanic has. Im sure CCP had the right idea but the execution was terrible and I think we should at least acknowledge that a significant majority of the support for this mechanic has nothing to do whenever its a good or bad mechanic but because it has create a shitstorm of REEEEing from EVE Online Public Enemy #1  
---
Wormholer btw
---
how is burning all that even feasible including ls
---
A buggy, short sighted, knee jerk and unbalanced implementation. To me it feels like the drifter addition was done as a knee jerk because the next stage of the triglavian invasion had to be held back due to a game breaking bug or such. If you look at the stats of the drifters, they haven't been balanced correctly for this content.
---
burning 5 structure made want to drink bleach
---
They don't know highsec. Goon leadership also doesn't care if any of this makes sense as long as they feel they control the narrative of what they are doing. Dunno if the line members also just don't care or actually believe the stuff.
---
&gt;He actually scored about ~~even~~evan

Oh god thats even worse.

Go on, I welcome you to HS. 
---
Bash structures, pocos, players, whatever. I would only profit from it.
---
&gt;all HS citadels going away  
---
You're so delusional it's not even funny anymore. Seek help.
---
So they can fight in highsec during this but not in other null regions....?
---
" Despite what the bee man is reeing about. " The horde post about how this event is a shit show went live a few hours ago but go ahead and ignore it in favor of the grrr goons narrative.
---
This guy gets it
---
Because if you are not willing/wanting to join GSF you are mentally ill, so if you leave (Mitanni's mantra for allies/important ppl leaving).
---
That would require effort and communication... 2 things CCP is not any goof at and avoids at all costs.
---
Keep dreaming, some ppl 100% opt out of the nullsec bulls\*\*\*.
---
&gt;how much changes if a couple structures get killed?
---
Every one is busy defending their own structures, who is going to go finish the timers if the drifters don't? If this was the intention of the event CCP is incredibly stupid for not seeing the obvious result of everyone staying home to play defense and not following up on these timers.
---
What's the best way to do Abyssals with 3 characters?
---
Would running frigate t4 with all 3 chars be more profitable and manageable than running 3 individual t3s with cruisers?
---
Or other variant I didn't think about be better?
---
Probably suicide ganking, it will be funny to see if some are stupid enough to do it in starter systems. :)
---
I fail to understand how nullsec can't fight each other but can fight highsec because of drifters.
---
It's quite telling actually of how nullsec grew as one single entity that now act together against something they don't endorse.
---
The blue donut just lost the game. Now they are leaving nullsec to fight in highsec.
---
I'm eager to see what's next.
---
And thats why so many people always die when its burn Jita right??? Because most of high sec is linked by npc corp channels.... lmao
---
No their balls dropped badly.  The drifters dont come back dont cause the destruction or chaos required to really make a difference.  We as a whole community (well most) thought this was brilliant.
---
But as usually CCP half arsed does something.
---
CCP listen, please...everyone loves this but you have to,  no must  reprogram the AI to come back for timers for ALL  structures and also to attack ihubs and tcus.  Then this will be everything we all want..
---
As the OP  title says but I think you've got glass balls at the moment..
---
Agreed, have an upvote
---
So why didn't you type in Google for 10 seconds? ;)
---
True, that's the biggest difference.
---
Summer of rage was about the health of the game, this is just about having a hissy fit and trying to destroy the game we love, welcome to fullblown bob 2.0 (even though bob dudes loved the game overall, unlike goons).
---
Supers need to stay home in case anyone decides to finish what the drifters start.  Can't use supers in HS.  Logical conclusion is burn HS.
---
I heard what they said. I didn't buy it because of how fragile their justifications were. "We talked to them for 3 days we can't war them now" Motherfucker were you only wardeccing people because your xenophobia caught you up in your own narrative of grr casino?? If you actually did want to fight people then you'd go fight them and not be whining about how you suddenly can't do it
---
But now, the playerbase is not with you.
---
Not even all of nullsec will be with you.
---
Just because hiseccers don't historically vote in CSM elections doesn't mean they don't actually play the game.
---
I am on vacations typing on phone while getting drunk .... Sry
---
Exactly.  
---
It's in CCP's best interest to back down before shitstorm in highsec enters active phase.
---
It s PL. If a goon it s a big deal after what happen to tribute / Tenal / vale. :D Eventhought it s 45M ferox.
---
There is one good reason, annoying goons, and your alliance is providing proof of that in spades. :)
---
Who did you framed and backstabbed this week ?
---
Perhaps joins an Indy corp, see if you like it. If you don't then leave and look for something else.
---
Just be sure to check that they play in the same time zone as you.
---
Calling that line of reasoning logical is a fuckin stretch
---
By what we know of the design of these drifter invasions yes, but they are being altered live as we speak, and the ultimate goal is to get empires to fragment so that the supercapital umbrella's power gets reduced.
---
If you got your omega in a venture, next step would be procurer/covetor. The you could go down the missile/caldari line opens up kestrel, then hawk ( perfect for dark abyssals ). Then you're set for omega time. I'd recommend credit carding your omega over grinding for it though ( if your personal finances allows for it).
---
... Dude you are trying waaaaaaaaaaaaay too hard here
---
reading is hard
---
 he says everyone could dissapear.
---
You're calling it a circus and we haven't even finished moving back to delve from Tribute, just give it a few weeks before you start start talking about how nothing happened.
---
Just adapt?
---
This is why the only suit I own is a bog standard of the rail one. I've worn it three times in seven years for job interviews and a wedding I was a guest at. I got both jobs so it played its part well enough.
---
This really is the interesting part.  I dunno who or what triggered it, be it internal stuff, or Brave's success or what, but the 'opening of nullsec' was the beginning of the end for the old established powers.
---
i'm not sure on 'best' anymore tbh
---
Highs and mids are weird.
---
The kind of hero that goons need !!!
---
You must be a wizard for being able to say what CCP has planned when this was unexpected as well. Chill out
---
im trying hard by explaining that the difference in risk in j vs k space isnt as great as everyone says?
---
simple, highsec is not AI combat, we can beat highsec players easy, what we can't beat in the long run is AI players that can log in whenever, bash structures whenever, and ignore damage cap.
---
Reset everything? Nope.
---
But limit resources in a region if overconsumed? Yes.
---
It forces people to stretch thinner to make it worthwhile.
---
&gt;why not enjoy the ingame event for what it is
---
What is there to enjoy? You can;t fight these things with anything less than overwhelming numbers. There is no tanking or kiting them, there is no timing them as they are random. This whole event is d20 Bullshit.
---
Its everyone's spin, they hit Frat, Test, Goons and Horde.
---
Man fuck pointy shoes.
---
They have hitten LS, some KM are from LS.
---
You realize goons have npc corp alts too right?
---
Effectively it'll just end up with goons locust swarming region after region to sate their thirst. Slowly inching system by system burning everything down to the ground
---
Brave's early success shook up all of Nullsec - they looked, felt and smelt a lot like early Syndicate-era Goons, and those with long memories knew that. And they had the newbie fire hose for a long time, until the existing powers copied the model (and good luck to all of Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet, Brand Newbros and so on - keep looking after newbies).
---
But to be Goon-specific ... and I know very little of the internal politics of the Imperium  ... if I had to point a finger at one person, it'd be Aryth.
---
I think they realised they needed pubbies to beat their enemies, and they hated their enemies more than they hated pubbies.
---
This. It's not about the actions, its about the narrative.   
---
Trying to actually understand what burning random HS citadels has to do with a drifter invasion requires some "lateral thinking".
---
Trousers need ironing, shoes are warehouse clerk not horseracing spectator, and the guy is standing like he's holding a poo in.
---
"Boohoo this game is too hard"
---
I don't think it's in CCPs best interest to do a 180 every time nullsec throws a tantrum however
---
"logical"
---
Those people would be new and not as bitter as you yet.
---
His shins hit eaten by badgers.
---
You underestimate the level of goon autism.
---
Titans are less "ship" and more "mobile battle station", like the Death Star. Yeah, your weapon can blow lots of shit up at once, but you need an entire infrastructure and fleet support to back you up.
---
You've been trying too hard to passive-aggressively force a meme that doesn't want to be forced. You could have explained the difference in risk in half the text you used if you'd skipped out on trying to cast yourself as a superior, ironically in a discussion accusing other people of trying to act like they're superior.
---
If they don't follow up timers then ignore them
---
It is.  
---
What are they going to do to stop us from shitting up highsec?
---
Does it really combat inflation? The ISK is still in the economy and still in player hands. It just speeds up the process where it moves from ISK earners -&gt; marketers -&gt; builders -&gt; resource gatherers.
---
My view exactly.
---
Any idea how to get these skins?
---
Or living in wormholes. Some might even go to FW though that's even harder to understand.
---
Oh, i already did ;)
---
I won eve like 8 months ago
---
Yeah these damn drifters cut short the ~~mind-destroyingly boring structure bash~~ high-octane sov warfare action ! WHY DOES CCP HATE CONTENT
---
half the game already quit judging by the slope since I won eve
---
Well, we did receive some indication from Hilmar during one of his company talks that he was giving serious thought to throwing caution to the wind and breaking shit in the name of trying to improve the game. 
---
The drifter attacks would certainly fit into that, suggesting they're a prelude to much more disruptive changes, but we ultimately have no idea how much they want to rock the boat.
---
Wrong ... i opted out of nullsec about 5 months into my EVE playing and outside of short periods of time, never looked back.
---
Nullsec is too much hassle, too much work, too much drama, too much moving and too much bother ... so let others deal with it.
---
Then there are those who got into a certain playstyle and casually play the game the same way.
---
Or live in lowsec and take wh's to nullsec/other places where you can get fights. :)
---
my first comments were memes "wh guy: oh wow! i found another human today" and "make sure to lock yourself in your bearhole for no risk pve fag" then i started explaining why farming wh space dosent have much risk and yet no one has told me why i am wrong (the fact that the difference in risk in j vs k space isnt as great as everyone says)
---
how can i passively-aggressively force a meme and what meme am i trying to force?
---
when have i stated i was superior?
---
How many tards equipped their HS structures with anti-capital?
---
By which point everyone's attention will be elsewhere, and you can fully claim moral victory for 'believing it'. :)))
---
ToS no.25:
---
 CCP reserves the right to close, temporarily or permanently, any user’s account without advance notice as we deem necessary. Furthermore, we reserve the right to delete all user accounts or inventory of characters as warranted.
---
Burn highsec? Ok, I welcome the incoming vacuum and will gladly take it over when they leave :)
---
Agree, you anus is in peace bro \^\^.
---
&gt; 0 risk and game breaking rewards in null
---
the game breaking rewards are in lowsec, fam
---
Do you guys kill structures ? I would not mind lending a talos alt on ops?
---
Possibly... They do want corpses considering the lore... But possibly a gift to BOB for good h2hs.
---
NO NO NO
---
40hs of work / week, 4-8hs of commute, time with kids, wife, etc ... i have better things to do.
---
You listen to it if you've got free time.
---
What am I even looking at here? A nice screenshot of someone afk bashing a low power astra?
---
High quality content
---
If they focused on that fringe space, they would be essentially herding ppl into fewer systems, so higher population density, more power to the supercap umbrella.
---
Hold on m8, speed limits are enforced, even on backpedalling. :)
---
Wait he gives ccp money and the players content? omg how rude of him, we should bully him out for such crimes.
---
I thought we built our own spreadsheet program for even more extra autism... Am I correct?
---
If you're fully aware of the negative consequences of your actions, and do them anyway, you are deemed to consider those consequences acceptable vs whatever else it is you're doing. 
---
I didn't get the impression he wanted new people to quit, I did get the impression that they would be readily acceptable collateral damage in the name of having somewhere else to "inflict suffering".
---
Yeah, sure.  
---
Let's ban everyone for PvPing in pvp-oriented game.
---
I've seen deflections on drifters while manning structures so if they do somewhat ignore damage cap it's not a complete ignore.
---
Oh my
---
As a suit entrepreneur- this 100%
---
Thanks :)
---
Like half of that seems optional to me.
---
You can definitely spec it better to utilize weapons common across your platforms and the like.
---
Higher density also means more room for new entities to move in, instead of vast swathes of space which go mostly unused but not undefended.
---
Sino-futurism nickland thirst for destruction batteille
---
This is badly planned, badly implemented bug riddled content... What else is their to say. CCP just phoning it in.
---
Yes, compare played-buildable stations  to the ones that are relatively ancient of the Empires. Yes.
---
&gt; Thank you for finally creating a mechanic that will help to limit the size of space empires. 
---
It doesn't.  Do you even play Eve?  I mean apart from being a high sec pubbie.
---
Part of me is saying to give it a few weeks. Wednesdays is when they have previously changed things. So whatever starts on Wednesday will be the new normal for the following week.
---
Exploration would be the only way to do this that early.
---
Anything else you will have too low of skills to remotely make that much isk
---
All of those things except explo would not fit into his timeframe.
---
you still have the skill but you cant use it.
---
goon posting standards arent what they used to be it seems
---
They literally did nothing. The drifters are another example of CCP being absolutely terrible at doing anything good for the game.
---
Take your upvote and get the fuck out of here.
---
I think that CCP merely just added somethings to create chaos and increase risk in the environment.   I am perfectly happy with that.   That is all one can really say at this point.
---
Is no one going to ask how the hell it's taking him 43 days to train for a kestrel?
---
Complaining that the drifter storyline doesnt evolve and the trigs did, when it took weeks for stuff to change with the trig invasion ans it hasnt even been a week of drifters
---
HTFU
---
There already is lots of room out there, i don't see how more room will fix the problem of the supercap umbrella.
---
&gt; Despite what the bee man is reeing about. The majority of the player base is appreciative of the drifters!
---
The majority of nullsec is reeeing about this, not just the bee man...
---
It is very common
---
I would happily acknowledge it because this drama is so funny I don't even have to log in to collect salt from one side or another.
---
I get it, if I dont want to mine I have to resort to Frig/Dessi-PvP in FW Plexes ...
---
sure, google my flair
---
&gt; Very very very few bots might have died, just go through the zkill. It's mostly active fleet kills. There are no reports of any impact of Drifters on structures either. 
---
No botting corp got their api on zkill. Some of them die a lot to regular NPC and never show up on zkill.
---
Dude, any narrative is like 90% of EVE anyway.
---
check r/evejobs if you're still looking.

---
Ok will do
---
More goon posters are whining about it than Horde posters. 
---
Let Gobbins whine about it, they're trying to shove thousands of people into a single region and deserve to have drifters burn the space as much as goons do.
---
Yup.  Already happens in engagements today.
---
People wearing suits in general make me want to turn my face inside out.
---
This is great news. I need some tiling done in my kitchen. Over to you Grath.
---
*Fires up the traktor beams*.   
---
Oh well...   
---
:unzips:
---
Good catch on this, so the Drifter thing is an excuse and is in fact designed to mask this attempt on hisec market.   Personally I want them to try this because we need CCP to buff hisec producers anyway.
---
Delve is the new hisec
---
My Sabre alt had t1 guns... I quickly went for tII guns as all Sabre in contract had TII guns fitted ^^
---
Where did you get your Informationen that the majority likes it?
---
Bees, Beans, Dinos, and Pandas. Nature Strikes Back!
---
"All of the playerbase" isn't protesting this time though, it's just you.
---
There is a difference between PvP and doing a campaign with the goal to force CCP to change their course by causing HS players to unsub (even if I highly doubt this can be archieved) and thus hurting their revenue.
---
I am pretty sure CCP can come up with better solutions, but as a last resort, they can indeed ban everyone or even shut down whole alliances, if they think its necessary for the health of the game.
---
Maybe they will go to those systems as well ... at the end ... if they don't kill citadels, we will basically never know, as bots don't report anything about structures getting hit and will continue botting, no matter if a structure is under attack or not ...
---
You are wrong, the total oppression ended in 2013 with Phoeb, after that many small groups took nearly all Lowsec R64 from PL. Sometimes they deployed to take back (like to Aridia), only to lose the moons a few days after redeploy plus some super stragglers that missed move op.

Dressing like a preppie frat boy with daddy's Submariner doesn't make you look like you own it, fyi. The watch should suit the outfit, if it looks out of place then it is evident you are trying too hard.
---
Usually one saves their nicer ones for evening events while wearing a smartwatch for casual or day to day work (unless at a business function that requires you to show you are financially well off).

I think he meant some kind of hostile takeover of the alliance by another corp in the alliance. Something like "this executor corp A is doing a bad job managing the alliance so we all vote corp B to become the new executor corp."
---
**space guild declares war on dev** sounds like something that would attract new players more than **space guild shoots npcs**

---
Fair point, lowsec is more than just FW. I thought the WH spawn rate in low had been nerfed though?
---
so you are not in horde and therefore not a member of the nullsec blocs. Still proving my point.
---
jesus christ ... watching paint dry must be an incredibly exciting thing for you guys.
---
I salute you for your dedication, though
---
&gt;More goon posters are whining about it than Horde posters.
---
Pick those goal posts up and run bitch, first it was "no one but goons" now its "more goons"
---
clearly you haven't read all the details released about these things, their DD's can be fired at structures and ignore damage limits.
---
Loudest mouthbreather in EVE? That'd be The Mittani.
---
He's married, they both had SA accounts.
---
&gt;4-8hs of commute
---
sweet jesus, how far away from home is your job?
---
Just like they banned every CODE member ever for harassing poor defenseless miners.  
---
Or like they banned ever wardecker for attacking poor defenseless one-man indie corps.
---
you tweaker like attention span is not my problem.
---
Why put any effort into fighting the drifters if they dont return for the armor timer? Seems like a huge waste of time. Just let them do AI things like the Lancers or whatever
---
you mean like the last Ice Interdiction when you quickly ran back to null just after 2 days or so?
---
Only people who haven't overstretched themselves by throwing up structures all over the damn shop.
---
I think it's clear that CCP want smaller, more robustly defended pockets of owned space, and this mechanic is annoying everyone who (suprise suprise) thinks they can spread all over tha damn map like coffee over a programmer's desk, or oil on a pristine beach, or whatever metaphor you wanna jam in here.
---
You do not recognize the bodies in the space.
---
Let see how long you keep up that point of view when CCP extends this event to highsec and you all have to defend your structures, because as everyone likes to keep pointing out, we haven't reached stage 3 yet...
---
Don't ya think, just hear me out here, ya think maybe the reason they aren't killing a lot of bots, is because the botters just switched them off and logged for now? Which is still mission fuckin' accomplished.
---
But the point of this fleet comp is you wouldn't lose any unless your FC is a completely useless idiot.
---
No we bully him for actually being bad at playing eve, not losing ships but actually being bad at pushing the buttons.
---
Yes. That would have been better.
---
DELICIOUS, I SAY!
---
In all seriousness, they're a little bit too salty.
---
&gt; if your goal is to make waves and make ccp notice the way to do it is to hurt their bottom line..
---
It's not quite so simple.
---
Just unsubscribing doesn't cause nearly as much damage as unsubscribing and encouraging others to do likewise. It's why people martyr themselves in public rather than in the comfort of their own homes - to make a visible statement in the hopes of encouraging others to do or think X, Y and Z.
---
Personally I've let 4 of my 5 accounts expire, I keep one around to do admin stuff for old friends. The game wasn't isn't in a place where I want to spend £500 a year on it, and for each "Why did you unsubscribe" surveys they sent, I wrote a fair bit explaining why.
---
Ironically the biggest way Goons could ever effect the game is by coordinating a mass unsubscribe among their members.
---
Lolol.
---
"you only get eve if you play it my way"
---
Do we even know what the null/hisec population divide is these days?
---
There is no reason to bully a person who is bad at eve
---
*you're
---
Where is this gorgeous corpse ball floating? Asking for a friend........
---
r/evejobs is a decent place to start.
---
The issue isn't the fact that there is a lack of *unoccupied* space so much that there is a lack of *undefended* space. There's a lot of space owned by large blocks that isn't really actively used and is dead most of the time, but which is still defended against any entities that want to set up shop.
---
Ha. Thanks, I feel a bit less foolish in relative terms ;)
---
Dual box fc, so they have to kill him twice to get him off the field. Thought it was pretty standard.
---
Well yeh the reason is that he's bad at eve :p
---
No capitals on HS. Numbers can be contested some how...
---
HS is more likely to undock than NC.
---
The thing here is that no corp in all of New Eden can teach you all of this. Corps and players tend to specialize. You may not yet know what you want to do in EVE. Make a guess and try it. (Be aware that trying some things can make it harder to do others. Ask the people you're joining--they'll know if this applies.)
---
&gt;Fast forward to now: NC/PL and the northern regions have been glassed
---
1 region. They forgot a few.
---
Shaking things up, sure, but you can't say more than that. Everyone worked themselves into a frenzy claiming that the drifters would hunt bots (it happened to snag a Hel from an alliance people believed were filled with bots, so I can understand why) and it had RF'd and killed a Jump gate (which happened to have a much shorter RF timer and came out when drifters were still on grid and thus able to kill it).
---
So yes. I can understand that the series of coincidences may have caused some people to believe it was something intentionally designed by CCP.
---
However it's ultimately just that, coincidences.
---
I think it's unfair to take those two coincidences, spin them widlyl out of proportion and then get mad about how they're not doing more. Much less start shitting on CCP for not "following through" or having the balls to do something like this.
---
The whole mechanic is retarded and r/eve is going mental on defending a shitty mechanic that won't improve the game in any meaningful way.
---
man, how I miss the old HTFU days when at least the higher ups weren't just a bunch of crybabies.
---
Is that a graveyard?
---
If you had actually played the game in the past couple of months you would know that glassing a region does not solve anything and it doesn't "start over", it just causes a little inconvenience. Null blocks would simply unanchor structures and move everything to somewhere safe, wait out the glassing, then move back in. Within a month we would all be back in the same postition we were at before the glassing.
---
&gt;ALL of nullsec 
---
Haha
---
the more suspect you are of botting^1 the more likely it should be for drifters to to show the fuck up on the site youre running.
---
1: long playtime eg 23/7, only ever doing combat sites in one pocket, never changing ships, never pvping or roaming, suspect mouse movements (always clicking the same pixel on a box, tick perfect actions), excessively repetitive behavior for long periods of time
---
He likes it therefore everyone must like it duh
---
Like I said, they will most likely do something else first (see removal of insurance for Concord losses, changes to hull resistance, recent wardec changes)
---
Or inflation could go higher. Yesterday a Lot of Goonies that i know were taking out the Plex of market. From 5000 to 15000 each... And they are a Lot...
---
This explains why I saw someone selling 86 Corpses in Jita earlier.
---
Sure, CCP can do many things.  
---
The only thing they cannot do is implement a major change without major fuckups.
---
&gt; Much less start shitting on CCP for not "following through" or having the balls to do something like this.
---
I think it's more an attempt at goading CCP into pushing harder with it. They, for once, did a smart thing with  not announcing preset conditions ahead of time, meaning they can actually change it as they see fit and it all be "part of the plan".
---
well... they are investors in that venture. So, it's not only blue but actually they own (a part of) it
---
If CCP actually wants "smaller, more robustly defended portions of space" then they are doing the exact fucking **OPPOSITE** of what everybody has been telling them. We don't need or want another Delve. And with JBs it's no problem at all to defend larger empires. It's just annoying.
---
CCP's last pair of balls (Guard) quit earlier this year.
---
Or just someone with basic reasoning skills that can look at CCP's history.
---
Laught in a shattered with an orca mobile base
---
A word of warning. Grinding isk just to pay your sub as a new player is a sure fire way of getting eve burnout.
---
OP is saying that this mechanic is doing something it is not. Which suggests that he is not impacted by it. Twisting words makes you look a lot worse than the dude who's words you just twisted.
---
Not really.  I am all for any kind of PVP shakeup to citadel and sov mechanic stagnation.  Key word being PVP.  PVE in EVE is shit, spawning OP rats out of their asshole to try to mess with the terrible sov/citadel system is NOT the way to do it.
---
I agree with your centament but I don't think this is an ideal mechanic to accomplish the goal, which is fine, nothing is ever perfect.
---
But is what you say about the majority of players outside goon likeing this true? Isn't there some massive unprecedented treaty between all major null blocks just signed to embargo jita and high sec?
---
badum tiss
---
I think the new K-space Drifters don't have a Doomsday, only the ones spawned after attacking the Autothysian Lancers or if you're close to a Drifter wormhole or a Jove observatory.

Wealth and blues you mean?
---
Added over a week period of time .....
---
Oh but Papa Hilmy assured us there was gonna be a huge shakeup!  If this is the best he's got we may as well all quit now and play Candy Crush.
---
I did not read of any such changes, if you heard something pls link to it.
---
you're still here
---
Trying to find the intelligent argument .... my mistake for trying it.

ofc the drifter invasion happens while under the watchful eye of shitliner, ~~shadoo~~ doomchinchilla would be spitting in his grave if he saw what you have turned pl into

\*clap\* beautiful, simply beautiful. This post is a work of art, many will be triggered this day.

Uh.
---
Gonna go out and say it, you could seperate the characters and do this much much better with a quicker and better result-
---
IE- dedicated scanning character, dedicated subcap main, dedicated logi char etc
---
This wasn't the way to do it.
---
I'm all for reducing the blue donut and dropping the number of citadels but holy shit this Drifter shit got Mittens, Gobbins, and Vince in a room together.
---
This does NOT fix any of the problems in EVE at ALL.
---
its hard to do the math, but I'm doing solo t3 abyss and fleet t4's with friends (so what u are thinking about but downsided to a single account) the solo t3's barelly make out fillament cost sometimes, they have been super bad latelly, u are basically grinding very low isk until u get a dissintegrator specialisation skillbook or other valuable stuff, which is rare. the t4's on the other hand have been much better for us and the average loot/site is much better even without the amazing drops
---
We take lots of holidays
---
Thank you!
---
Absolutely possible.
---
Could be determined by a pattern we don't have data to figure out yet.
---
Looks like the whole of Nullsec is on fire, not just the Bees.
---
If you want to break an empire you have to wreck it from within.
---
So twisting my words must make you like... Super bad then? I'm not even attacking the guys point, just sick of people on this sub dismissing people as "high sec pubbies" just because they want their views to carry more weight
---
But since we're here, we'll unpack your faulty logic anyway. The proliferation of a blue donut/stagnant hi sec run by overbearing corps effects everyone in eve. From line members right through to the "hi sec pubbies" that spend all day farming or whatever. Lots of people in hi sec never venture into low or null because they feel the only way to thrive there is to join a massive corp where they will loose their identity. Every thread about joining corps contains some sort of warning about joining a large group of sperg lords and we can debate the pros and cons of this mindset till we are blue in the face, but the fact remains that the current status quo does affect everyone who plays eve. It impacts on every players experience and everyone deserves to have an opinion about whether ruining the goons day = a good or bad thing. 
---
The dominant paradigm isn't for everyone. Nor is it necasserily what's best for the game. 
---
EVE has been dominated by the voices of nulsec alliances for a very long time, but I don't think we should underestimate the damage that's being done by the slow stagnation of nul , or the steady amelioration of power. We don't have to sit here, and bismirch every decision that upsets the big power blocks just because it ruins someone's day. What's bad for you might be good for him in the long run, and you can't just dismiss people for having a different opinion. 
---
Well, you can, but it makes you a tit. In my opinion.
---
Fighting hisec is no more commitment than a big roaming fleet. In null warfare you need all kinds of stuff going on at the same time to make progress (bashing, entosising, keeping tabs on the enemy, defending etc.) and you need to keep all those efforts under your super fleet. "Warfare" in hisec is literally go in, bash, go out.
---
10/10 for the effort! Must have taken a lot of time
---
Pve often engenders pvp. Ratting draws out the carriers that we hotdrop; mining puts juicy targets on grid and exploration is a fantastic solo pvp generator. Pretending the two things are somehow separate and unconnected is incredibly disingenuous.
---
A pve mechanic that makes it easier for smaller corps to sieze space from large blocs would create a pvp shakeup, no?
---
Cringe overload
---
So what is your proposed solution?
---
I hope phase 2 of the plan is a combined null sec invasion of highsec.   Everyone starts in Jita and burns everything in its path towards home.  Maybe send  teams too mission hubs too gank all the officer fit highsec Bear Mobiles. 
---
If Eve is dead we need to burn the corpse.  Winter is coming.
---
really? that's what it has come to? the difference is: one is a player, the other not
---
 Despite what the bee man is reeing about. The majority of the player base is appreciative of the drifters!  
---
Really, did you poll the majority of the player base or did you just pull this statement out of your arse?
---
\&gt;  you can't just dismiss people for having a different opinion 
---
Most of your comment was either misconception or misinformation, so I think it's OK to dismiss it.
---
It is very unlikely that there will be defenders for the majority of those structures. It'll be 90%+ afk bashing.
---
No, they just have never been miners, and CCP leaves with no choice today but to mine your soul out, multiboxed, to stay competitive in power-creep. And you are right, most of them now are kissing girls or playig other games. And I have no Idea how 50% of playerbase leaving since 2013 could affect your game ...
---
OK. I'd like to correct any misconceptions on my part though, so I'd genuinly appreciate any insight into why what I've said is dismissable
---
Alright, that's valid. d( '-' d)
---
How do you 'maintain' such a list when citadels can be destroyed/unanchored?
---
Post proofs
---
No u
---
Indeed, thanks for your videos, good stuff.
---
This current does nothing about Giant space empires. They arent hitting far off systems full of bots and ratters. Or the literal thousands of low power structures ages away from anywhere.
---
The only thing they are hitting is the most active areas of nullsec.
---
I absolutely do not support goons current drool, but what CCP is doing right now is the exact opposite of good for the game.
---
I really had hoped they had gotten their shit together for once and made these things shoot all the overextended stuff.
---
Lol! Probably the most immature response Goons could give to being attacked.
---
Please do it! Burn hisec! More content is always good and nullsec blocks crying is hilarious!
---

yeah just alt member corps, but reddit narrative you know

I keep asking myself as a viewer (on stream) - was it worth dropping a dread bomb on him after wiping out the FAXes/Nyx/other ships (speed of his HP going down after Phenomena generator thing stopped working gave me an impression that subcaps could have finished him off rather easily themselves)?  Maybe inviting more people in subcaps (even if it is for the sake of having Erebus on their killboard, everyone wants one)  before turning a fully neuted out, zero fuel titan (that wasn\`t even been able to fire its F1 after neuts) into a wreck would have been a better idea (i just wish entire brawl party lasted longer than it did... and that titan never intended to go away anyway)?

These are all really oddly specific. Is there some drama I'm missing?
---
Nice video! I was the stork, really hard to hold tackle on an Iki, those guns just track too well :)
---
If you say "the drifters are good for the game, they are hitting null empires" when that is clearly not the case in any significant way, you are just plain wrong. And amybody that is saying this clearly does not interact with null in any meaningful way. Which implies that OP is a hisec pubbie, because every other type of player interacts with null to a sufficient degree to see that this invasion does fuckall. Also
---
&gt;Lots of people in hi sec never venture into low or null because they feel the only way to thrive there is to join a massive corp where they will loose their identity.
---
So everybody in hisec is delusional then? Are you really saying that some hisec miner not joining null is because of their "identity"? People stay in hisec because of the safety it offers and nothing else. Because there is 0 difference between pressing f1 on a rock in hi vs in delve. 
---
&gt;EVE has been dominated by the voices of nulsec alliances for a very long time
---
Maybe that's because null is quite literally meant as *the* defining feature of EVE? Or could you name a significant event that didn't happen because of, or in, null? If you were to ask a random person who has never played, what could they most likely tell you about? B-R5? Maybe X-47? Sure other playstyles exist, and do have their place, but CCP has cut itself down significantly, so are they really to blame for focusing their effort on their defining feature? 
---
&gt;but I don't think we should underestimate the damage that's being done by the slow stagnation of nul , or the steady amelioration of power
---
Nobody is doing that. The current situation is a direct consequence of shitty game design. Everybody that knows even a speck about this game can see that.
---
&gt;We don't have to sit here, and bismirch every decision that upsets the big power blocks just because it ruins someone's day
---
We aren't. We are complaining about a dog shit mechanic that serves no purpose but to artifically annoy null players through an enemy they can't fight back against.
---
&gt;What's bad for you might be good for him in the long run, and you can't just dismiss people for having a different opinion.

As it turns out, it's bad for "him" (presumably the hisec player?) because now we have to look for less time consuming ways of creating content for our members. Which is kicking over the sandcastles of hiseccers. And I can very much dismiss an *uninformed* opinion.
---
I dont get it
---
fighting nc was just practice for goons
---
And in the time I was in the second time I successfully sold a few hels to test without anyone noticing.. well, in goons at least. Fuccboi kept mouthing off about how he kept "stealing hels out of towers" instead of being quiet and sappo had to stop the operation because it was getting too sus.
---
I haven't checked reddit in over 24h now. What did I miss? Why is this going over my head?
---
Ye clearly :D ! The amount of dps (~350 first application) almost perflectly applyied... A complet nightmare
---
They weren't the kings you know ;)
---
uh, welcome to r/Eve?
---
Bigger guns = better DPS. Amirite!!!
---
It's not uninformed. It's just different to yours. You hold that people stay in hi sdc cos it's safe and they're scared, I know plenty of people who stay in hi sec because they think that the dominance of large, homogenous power blocks makes nul incredibly boring.
---
You say that eve is all about nul, but I know plenty of people who play eve exclusively in WHs, low sec or high sec. If I'm being honest, it sounds like you genuinly think EVE should focus on the experience of nul sec players and that's where my issue with your point comes from.
---
Game-of-Drones has not posted for a while, so there is a chance it is caused by recent events
---
Aha, the DD ignoring the limit may well be it. A lot of what has been posted needs sifting so I'm still mostly cross-verifying.
---
I don't know if burning High Sec is the right thing to do at this time.  But, I would rather do the wrong thing and cause havoc rather than just watch it in fear.
---
Some of you get it.
---
Hit densely populated areas measured by economic activity. Have drifters roam around regions and attack random players. Make them drop worthwile loot. Make them focus low-power structures that don't see much use. Have them follow up on timers. Give us a way to disrupt their operations. Give us a warning. Have them not literally appear out of nowhere in some obscure no-activity timezone. Give them the ability to chain bash several structures in a system if they aren't stopped.
---
Sure that isn't perfect, but it would be a lot better than currently
---
Wait, now I'm confused. I thought that was the coalition of low-sec groups lead by HTP and PHEW.
---
How do you think smelling attempts in vacuum will go?
---
For someone out the loop the last couple weeks, is there a quick ELI5 for what drifters are doing? Killing citadels it sounds like? All over new eden?
---
Yeah fair. I agree with all that.
---
Thanks for the heads up, I found Stitch\_K on youtube and will enjoy the content aswell.  Support the EVE Online streamers and Youtuber\`s they bring fresh blood (and killmails) to our beloved game!
---
While there's a huge amount of skills to put points into, a new player with a focused skill build can make a character that's specialised in a particular area and just as effective as 15-year bittervets in terms of stats. The only difference is player skill and game sense.
---
Good for a chuckle. Thanks.
---
To be fair, you have to be really afk to get killed by the equippable weapons in Highsec
---
Ask your corp leadership if its just a tiny bit annoying or not
---
Your post reads "I lick windows and have no idea how these things actually work"
---
Not really - I got what I think was a very undeserved rollocking from ‘middle management’ in Eve over the weekend and I’m getting shit at work today from somebody trying to climb the ladder so I posted this ramble on my break.
---
Aryth is just mad at CCP not telling the CSM before so gwen can exploit the shit out of it for their own benefit. Like the Martini he turns into a giant cry baby on this one.
---
Its a moving buffet, as we re-visit a region we edit any entries that have changed or been removed.  What has been noted during our time is the lack of change in general.  People tend not to change them unless attacked.
---
oh someone usually logs in to strip the fit :D
---
Nah npc corps are spy safe :)

So it's an ongoing effort? That's insane dedication! Qudos :)

I don't think so
---
99% of "Internet shitstorms" start exactly this way. Projecting your hoped is a nice term for just a hype train
---
TBH i would be okay with some massively beefed up version of the hull repair that is high slot and stops any other high slots from being used and anchors the ship like a deployed state. A complete shutdown and full vulnerability of a ship for the sake of a repair in space seems like a decent tradeoff and i think people would have a hard time finding any way to exploit something like that.
---
...and if you get popped while using it, well, don't repair if you're likely to get shot at.

This, coming from a hisec player? The area whose defining feature it is to literally shut down any meaningful content? It seems your friends don't have a solid grasp on how daily gameplay in null functions. 
---
&gt;play eve exclusively in WHs, low sec or high sec.
---
Sure. Good for them. Except that all of them, save wormholes, could probably have a very similar, but much better experience in other games. People don't play EVE for it's groundbreaking mechanics or fun and rewarding PvE. They play it for the intrigue, the conflict, the stakes, the personalities, the stories and finally, their place in it all. That aspect is just completely absent in high, and extremely cut back in low. That is just simply not the vision of the game.
---
This is what goons have been saying all along but a person with horde flair says it and all of a sudden its fair.
---
do you have the update stl file then or ? :)
---
Either join a corp that's getting their structures bashed so you get a notification, or check recent drifter kills on zkill. Unfortunatly they cannot be scanned down.
---
When CCP come out and say that they never intended for people to play in hi sec, or that EVE is all about nul drama, I'll accept everything your saying and apologise profusely for enjoying the game wrong. Until then, I'm going to keep playing the way I play and reserve the right to form opinions about certain areas of the game.
---
Fwiw I'm predominantly a wh player but I interact with a lot of people that feel nul culture is just sperging and sure, we know that isn't true, but you must realise this thought process is present, and that it's not just fear keeping people out of hi sec right?
---

How are drifters making it easier for smaller corps to seize space from large blocs?
---
Ahhh okok 7/10 mene
---
Well, I haven't seen it delivered that elegantly, tbh. I just hear a lot of whinging about how annoying the mechanic is and I honestly didn't even look at flair because I am 100% not invested in nulsec drama so...
---
Well they're not right now are they? I was replying to a generalised point about how pve mechanics arnt the solution to the blue donut. That we need to shake up pvp instead of wasting our time with pve.
---
Mostly their amount of bots grow under the Test NIP - if you fly to [Wicked Creek](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/region/Wicked_Creek)  nowadays you see like 4-6 botalts in every system, named XI1 - XI10 and so on
---
Yea but one out of every 10 games you will have a friendly  competent team while the enemy team is also very good as well. This leaves you with a very fun, challenging match where everyone works together and forgives each others mistakes.
---
55 minutes later you have a very satisfying win. Then the next 8 games are filled with trolls.

&gt; fuck dying in my shiny shit on some random gate because there's any actual risk in nullsec even though i can easily avoid it
---
This seems like a better summary to me. Yeah the drifters aren't ideal but all the complaining is literally "oh no we could lose something or have to deal with something and it isn't just passively scared off by our numbers and supercaps"
---
Fair lol
---
I mean, it's not me who is under too much assumptions on what your words convey and what they don't, as well as how good your baseless guesses on EVE's economics are.
---
Now that you were here bitching for like half a day about what you've meant, rest assured people see what you mean, but it is by no means reflected in your original post.
---
For future reference: pointing out that you've been pondering something does not indicate that none of your references and statements are based on facts by default.
---
&gt; I would love to see your reaction to the drifters if you had to do at least an hour of chores before you could play the game lol
---
So anyone living in wormhole space, doing incursions etc.?
---
He got it where r/eve gets the majority of their data. The gut and heart.
---
And check your spelling.
---
EVE has always been about player interaction. In high, that is actively discouraged. In low, there is simply no reason for it. In WHs it gets made difficult by the mechanics. In null, it's a necessity. 
---
You can form whatever opinion you want, I will just call you out on the fact that it is factually wrong. The current drifter invasion is only affecting null people so far, and only negatively. It's not actually damaging us, it's just annoying.
---
And please, tell me what experience you can have in hisec, that you can have in no other game. Really, I'm interested.
---
sounds like a horrible mindset in eve 2k19
---
I'm not factually wrong lmao. Opinions =/= facts and the measure of what makes a playstyle viable is not whether it is unique to this game or fits with what you have defined as the spirit of eve. Honestly, I want to engage with your points but AI can't get past the fact that you've chosen a perspective and literally will not see that what you think eve is about, might not be why everyone is playing
---
People play this game for hundreds of different reasons dude. Not just to interact with people in nul. There are plenty of active communities in high, low and wh space
---
I agree, thank you CCP.  The entire concept of playing in a universe that includes Artificial Intelligence is magnificent.  I welcome the challenge, and I hope that this new AI system comes to other aspects of the game.
---
SURE LOOKS FUN

Dude. The correct title of such a post is: "EVE is kill".

i´m gald you post this here \^\^ this is what happens if you DCed in a drifter system :)
---
btw i wasnt the fc \^\^ but yes they can alpha a monitor
---
&gt;And highseccers didn't care that highsec was a safe place to mine for 10 years
---
Compare apples to apples rather than calling out double standards where there are none. First of all, miners get ganked in HS all the time, it's *less* safe than null space if you're in a big blob with supercaps on standby. Second, the gains of mining in HS are maybe 10-15% of what can be gained in null (less skewed if you look at only ice but still massively lower). Having a massively lessened amount of income for the sake of relative safety is a fair tradeoff; that's how it was for a very long time and it was balanced enough.
---
I'd personally be fine if nullsec was perfectly safe and incomes were nerfed to just above the income of comparalbe activities in highsec. Would you prefer that over complaints about null being too safe?
---
Also, if you really think all of null existed purely by paying for plex for 10 years you're very much living in a different world. The concept of ratting and mining for income as well as exploration and industry are all pretty damn old and people have been using it as main source of income since null was a thing. If someone does nothing but pvp naturally they'll gain no income, but people who take time to get income in null get vastly more than anything in highsec.
---
Thank you
---
A tons of yep ! Corporation bookmarks
---
Typical CPP: show a green dot on TQ ... but not being ready at all. 
---
More bugs than bytes.
---
You will not make enough to plex using a venture mining. You will need to do something like exploration, a lot of hours of ratting, or high sec incursions or something.
---
It's roughly 2.1 billion isk for a month of gametime at this point. This means you need to average 100m isk a day for 21 days of the month (allowing for some days off).

Impossible. Hilmar would never admit old players area unsubbing. Theres only hordes of new player not subbing cause they don't like the NPE, everyone else is fine and having fun.
---
Up until a few months ago fitting anti cap structure missiles was the best strategy though, anti sub missiles were literally objectively worse. Cap missiles, even with worst case application, still did more dps
---
how's your AUTZ?
---
can I bring a drake?
---
fucking kill me
---
There's nothing unique or interesting about high. Literally nothing. Everything you can do there is done a billion times better in other games. So I am asking you the very legitimate question why you would pay 10-15 $ per month to get an objectively worse experience than you could have in other, cheaper, or even free games. I am interested in the reason for that. You can play whatever way you like. But you should not form an opinion about things you have no clue about. Case and point: The drifter invasion and it's effects. Can you please provide an exemplary argument on why you would play highsec over, say, WoW or Warframe?
---
Oh I’m not saying they don’t have their place. I love mine lol. But it’s just a standard Macy’s J Farrar suit and shoes I got tailored. Nothing super fancy.
---
&gt;The majority of the player base is appreciative of the drifters!
---
The majority of the player base is fucking retarded

So I don't know what is that supposed to prove

---
We pretty much won the null wars for good, time to wipe HS and completely kill this game! Vanilla WOW is coming next month, hope we're done by then and CCP files for bankruptcy!
---
yeah ik pretty dumb lots of losses to npcs on zkill
---
Basic reasoning skills + CCP history supported the "CCP broke something accidentally" theory. Sure a GM said it's working as intended but that doesn't actually disprove anything.
---
You've shifted the discussion here but sure:
---
Eve has space ships. Some people really like the idea of flying space ships.
---
Eve provides opportunity to collaborate in joint ventures with other players (industry corps, wh groups etc)
---
EVE has more meaningful group play activities that reward commitment (sharing a wh with other people for example)
---
EVE makes it possible to play roles that don't exist in other games (dedicated trader, market mogul, explorer etc)
---
Eve rewards intelligence and dedication, doesn't spoon feed you and is hard tk grasp. Complexity makes success more rewarding and increases the sense of achievement you get from engaging in, say, trading
---
EVE is vibrant and full of different voices, which is precisely why your attack on different groups gets my back up.
---
Ultimately I can see it fro. Your pov: everyone in hi sec has failed to grasp eve, and their opinions about your space are annoying, but if you pause to consider that
---
A) there are other groups in eve
---
B) the state of nul space impacts these people too
---
Can you agree that these people would deserve an opinion on what happens on/to nul space, and don't deserve to be dismissed as high sec pubboes right off the bat?
---
Is the purpose of that fit to sit at 60km supporting your gang with frigate level DPS initially and having to warp off when a single ship with projection shoots at you?
---
Now they just have to win r/Eve.
---
Wonder how much PL would pay for all of that info.
---
mammals only pls
---
That's it get out
---
Could someone elaborate further? I always had the idea that one of the most admired qualities of Eve was that it wasn't "ABC easy to play" in the same way that this criticism was leveled at WoW after about 2008 - 2010. I've always understood that Eve had a steep learning curve and that's one of the best features that your status is earned.
---
Fun fact: You're allowed to go to nullsec at any time; even on your very first day in game!
---
Is CCP capable of conducting a fun experience anymore?
---
:(
---
fake news?
---
eye sea wut ewe did thur
---
Omg SOOOOO MANY BODIES LEFT BEHIND! 
---
*cries
---
I have spent 10 or so hours on the game 3 or 4 years ago so I did really enjoy it and at the time made a note to come back to it. My feeling was that it definitely had a learning curve and I wanted to come back to it when I could devote a good amount of time to it.
---
Can you play the game in more of a solo style or is it best played as a group style?
---
So basically you did what I said and what a lot of new players don't, join a group.
---
You seem to hate null so much that you don't see how more action in high sec could be a good thing.
---
A lot of people who try the game quit because they don't get it, it's too hard or playing solo is shit if you have nothing to work towards.
---
All of those things get solved by joining a group that knows their shit and then they may still decide the game is shit and quit but at least they know what the game is about.
---
So my point was that greater visibility of fleets in high sec might open new player eyes to the wider sandbox and get them into corps that aren't just leeching their taxes. 
---
And you've probably been in the wrong groups if you think nullsec takes too much effort. Every alliance worth something has a wellstocked market and JF service. 
---
But whatever, let the wormholes stay in their holes, the nullbears in null and the solo / small gang dudes in low and new players can think Eve is all about blinging out their ships to better shoot rats.
---
&gt; just sick of people on this sub dismissing people as "high sec pubbies" just because they want their views to carry more weight
---
The point being, actual effect of this drifter invasion is rather obvious and if someone claims what thread's OP claimed, it's fair guess that they don't even remotely play in null.
---
Sure, there are more regions than null and HS, but people expect better understanding of what effects necessity to defend your stuff causes from LS and WH folks as well, so that leaves us with more narrow field for guessing...
---
The Drifters are not here to ruin the game, they are here to ruin your game. :D
---
too long to read. no interesting either.
---
good luck with that. Probably the same type of krabber that docks up when i come into your system for a fight. There's nothing you can do that will make me "howl".
---
Anything causing the Goons to weep salty tears is good surely?
---
I feel that, regardless, you should wash your hands frequently anyway.
---
Far too often from my comfort am I in a toilet and the guy at the other urinal will zip up, and head directly for the door. It horrifies me.
---
So what is 'your line of work' in order to warrant such levels of autism :)
---
I'm thinking theres a google doc somewhere that accompanies this
---
r/eve is a place for trolling and shit posting, feelings should be banned
---
Losses are only 0 because you don't get killmails from NPCs...SMH.
---
im certain Delve has more Citadels than HS
---
You bring up Brisc, but then incorrectly apply the situation.  Brisc was falsely banned because SOMEONE ELSE sold their Molok.  That is not the same as saying that the CSM member is banned from selling things on the market.
---
Please show me in the rules that CSM members cannot trade in PLEX or anything else that you have mentioned.  You cannot, because they are not barred from doing so.  They just cannot break the NDA or obviously participate in insider trading.  
---
PLEX sales don't get ran by the CSM, that is a marketing decision, pure and simple, their input doesn't matter.
---
Speak for yourself
---
Never forgetti the classic Samoth Dassie "Bubble UP!" incident...
---
Nice video, hope you're well mate.
---
I get it. The Drifter invasion isn't turning out like you hoped. Delve isn't burning - despite all your wishful thinking - and you're running critically short on things to be smug about. Even so, this is a bit of a reach, isn't it?
---
With ~6-8 ship on grid i would like to see you in melee with an 1b5 ship :), especially when you get tackle they escalate and you get +10 guys on grid
---
We call this kind of gameplay "kite" dude
---
&gt;Some people really like the idea of flying space ships.
---
Rebel Galaxy, Avorion, No Man's Sky, Elite... There's a dozens of other, cheaper, bettet options if you want to fly spaceships.
---
&gt;Eve provides opportunity to collaborate in joint ventures with other players
---
So does almost any other MMO. The differentiating feature of EVEs collaboration is it's scope and width. Which only really comes into play in null.
---
&gt;EVE has more meaningful group play activities that reward commitment
---
Ever played a raid or literally any co-op game?
---
&gt;EVE makes it possible to play roles that don't exist in other games (dedicated trader, market mogul, explorer etc)
---
First and second, almost any MMO with a market has these. Third, No Man's Sky or Elite do it **MUCH** better.
---
&gt;Eve rewards intelligence and dedication, doesn't spoon feed you and is hard tk grasp. Complexity makes success more rewarding and increases the sense of achievement you get from engaging in, say, trading
---
Not in high it doesn't. EVEs complexity is only really relevant because the consequence of not grasping it is death and loss of assets. Do you have to understand fuckall about the game to play high? No. Because that consequence is prohibited by the game there. It also doesn't take a genius to figure out that many ships dead = more expensive ships/materials.
---
&gt;EVE is vibrant and full of different voices
---
So is literally any other game with an active community.
---
&gt;Can you agree that these people would deserve an opinion on what happens on/to nul space, and don't deserve to be dismissed as high sec pubboes right off the bat?
---
Should they have an opinion about something they don't understand, interacting with something that doesn't interact with them? I can't stop them. Should they not be called out for their obvious lack of knowledge? No.
---
Not sure that something that increases need for coverage by standing fleets capable of flying certain doctrines creates chaos in the end. Feels like once dust settles, we will have the opposite on out hands.
---
Why would CCP need to stop anyone from doing anything in a sandbox?
---
Just wait until they release npc proof citadel skins
---
No, you didn't, you gazed into the eye of the warp and despaired.
---
I got as far as the saber part and went "that's as far as you needed to go." 
---
After that you're just training a second subcap alt.  Then you'll need to train a new sabre alt.
---
Yes, EVE Online is considered difficult for new players to compete with more estabilished members.
---
By people who have no idea how the game works.
---
HAHA null players! Do monotonous, boring tasks that you can't avoid for no reward at all, just to be able to keep the sandcastle you worked for! Why are you mad about that? I, in my infinite not-involved, wisdom, aswell as CCP have concluded that this is the **only** solution to the current null meta! Adapt or die haha! /s
---
Ahahah ! I miss the hold good time too bro ^^
---
Doing well, i hope you too
---
Burnt out wormholer right here o/
---
Honestly, I don't think the Drifters are working fully as intended right now. However, like all changes, you need plenty of data in order to tweak things properly.
---
Let's see how it goes.
---
Haven't been playing Eve for more than a year. What kind of event is it? Are the structures actually at risk if not defended against AI bots?
---
That's only happens if Drifters invades jita, stop staging from there :)
---
That would require changing how resources respawn. Under current timings you don't really benefit if you move and gather as you go as opposed to staying at home and mining in upgraded systems until respawn hits.
---
That won't change if spawns will just become smaller.
---
No, so far, they just reinforce them.  I think there has been one offline gate and one offline cyno beacon killed.  
---
They don't (intentionally) show up for any timers they create, so it's mostly just an insipid nuisance chore.
---
Why would you change one dysfunctional pos for another?
---
Beer store?
---
pathetic.png
---
I'd rather have, shooting faces in stations.
---
Don't be delusional, the retention rate is 4%. I'd bet the 4% are friends/family more often than a random guy who read about a large battle.
---
I've talked to literally dozens upon dozens of potential players. They've heard about the battles but they tried and either couldn't figure the game out or wasn't sure where to go/do, so they bounced.
---
Hell, this event is making news. So if that's your argument, this is a great thing.
---
Honestly makes me think some of these are players or players controlling whole fleets
---
I work in a supermarket, the amount of staff I see doing this is scary

Is this the thingiverse version?  [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:150755](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:150755) or did you model it yourself? The backside of your print looks a lot more detailed than the thingiverse version.
---
1) Is a consequence of CCPs game design favoring exactly that type of behaviour. Punishing players for playing the way they intended is fucking stupid.
---
2) There's no shake up being created. And it's actually burning out the players, as it's basically a mandatory entosis op every single day that you are not getting any kind of reward for.
---
So I would choose 3). DOING THE THINGS PLAYERS AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN SUGGESTING FOR ALMOST THREE YEARS NOW TO FIX THE SITUATION.
---
Are there any corp that has a focus of activities such as mining, pirating and trading?
---
For general wormhole alts you should be doing either helios or sabre first depending on which you need more. If it's your first alt helios. After that it's your choice of DST(impel/occator) --&gt; freighter(charon) or hole rollers (hic/battleship(mega)/carrier) depending on your class of wormhole. Everything else comes after that
---
Join as soon as possible.
---
Nah, it has always come largely from sovnull blocs. Same with the minerals that are almost exclusively found in null ore. Wormhole cannot keep up with the demand
---
Yeah that's kind of the whole point of the comment that I replied to, making resources scarce
---
TBH probably not all HS citadels because who wants to grind that.
---
Probably ECs, with a preference for Sotiyos, and high-manu index systems.
---
WHs were not well-suited for newbs ho didn't have a few months of training under their belt if they actually want to do stuff there. Did that change with changes to new accounts / skills etc.?
---
Lol needed CCP to nerf panfam for you? Should have just built more capitals
---
Uh, so pandemic horde is in on it too. Pretty sure test and frt will be as well
---
 Here’s a better idea:
---
For nullsec tie structure counts directly to system, constellation and regional limits.
---
E.g at most 1 keepstar per constellation, and it requires that every system in that constellation is at ADM 6.
---
A maximum of X keepstars per region. 
---
Anything dropped that exceeds this limit, drifters permanently reinforce and try to kill. 
---
Similar but more relaxed scenarios for fortizars/azbels/medium citadels etc. 
---
This forces alliances both to spread out their crabbing efforts, spread out their capital umbrellas as well as preventing citadel spam situations AKA delve. 
---
problem solved.
---
Eating shit? Who dropped it? Was it a move op? or spy? Link to the KM's bro!
---
If you can't put ingame or reddit politics aside when meeting people irl, you should seek help.
---
This is something everyone has to figure out for himself. 
---
That said, mining propably yields the best "isk/knowledge needed". You basically need to know which ore/ice is worth the most, how/where you can make it to money and how not to get caught mining.
---
My mind has been illuminated,  past present and future are revealed to me. 
---
*Gaze upon the void and see the whispers.*
---
You won't last. You're too lazy.
---
No. The majority of the player base thinks they're fucking stupid. It's just a vocal minority that really likes them
---
That guy is not bad. He has 1100+ solo kills. That’s more than 95% of the cowards who needs someone to hold their hand, outship the enemy, and have more numbers.
---
Bravo to the guy who keeps dying and keeps trying to become a solo player in a F1 monkey world.
---
I don't think the problem is the alliances. Goons need to find somewhere to keep their alliance bussy.  It's the line members that keep joining the blob. There is a reason that goons are so big. And it's because of people joining them.
---
Well
---
It's not exactly a secret that a lot of the miners/ratters in Brothers of Tangra are alts of \~elite\~pvpers\~; which means they ***were*** doing the same things to earn isk that we're doing, only shamefully and less efficiently. We have zero shame about krabbing as hard as possible during peacetime so that we can drop our giant sweaty nuts on people during war. Meanwhile, our enemies are only playing half the game and wondering what CCP is going to do to stop us from playing all of it. 
---
To the leaders of NCdot and Pandemic Legion: Might I humbly suggest that, while you're waiting for CCP to nerf Goons, you reconsider your elitist bullshit attitudes about wealth generation and become a more well-rounded alliance while you still can. Use the space that you have (left) to its full potential. Then again, that's kinda why we worked so hard to burn your shit down: we thought you might actually be using it as more than as a way to keep your names on the map.
---
Wut. Way to twist words
---
Dandelion meat popsicles &lt;3
---
Some people enjoy solo, but in those cases you really have to work hard to make your own fun. If you're part of a group, then you can just log in to join fleets and everything's a lot easier to get into. EVE is definitely more of a group game rather than a solo one, especially if you're starting out.
---
I like the community, not the game itself
---
Try them all and repeat the ones you find the most fun FOR YOU.
---
Your attitude exudes it.
---
&gt;&gt;1090 HiSec Systems of which 760 could hold POS
---
&gt;&gt;46867 HiSec Moons of which 33426 could hold POS
---
Would be interesting to see how many POS there are, and were on maximum.
---
Just from the raw numbers we are not even close to the possible number of POS. So the citadel spam might just be a thing of perception.
---
How many blues do you have again? And what was the reason for that again? Why didn't you just fight for you space when PL evicted you after WWB lmao
---
Or run for CSM.
---
Retention rates are like 4.5%. roughly similar to other MMO
---
That was soo bad. Take my upvote
---
This happens in the office more times than I would like to mention.
---
I now open doors with either my feet, or my sleeve.
---
Imagine thinking Goons is everyone. Yikes.
---
A lot of things have been "working as intended" over the years until they suddenly weren't — with no actual change in how they were working.
---
&gt;Difficult? Yes, but far from impossible. The difficult part is to gather enough knowledge about the game to not get stuck in low income activities and find the ways to accelerate your progression
---
Is there a fundamental rule of thumb you could share that might help avoid this scenario?
---
&gt;One of the best ways to make money is incursions. Unfortunately you need a blinged battleship to join them and it takes months for an alpha to get in one. The obvious shortcut is to buy Plex with real money and use that to pay for Omega and buy skill injectors.
---
Are you talking about purchasing a Titan with real world money for about $3,000 and do many players do this?
---
&gt;Those people are right, however, the defining attribute of new players is that they don't have this knowledge or skill while veteran are likely to have acquired it over the years in addition to better ships and fits.
---
So new players might have a disadvantage in the overall experience when it comes to certain areas of game play where that experience becomes more valuable where in these situations new players will be at a certain disadvantage which is understandable
---
Most of production has moved to engineering complexes
---
That's good to know! It seems that specialisation is a core fundamental in achieving success in-game!
---
They balance all the time m8, that's why you're not flying T3 ahacs all day anymore.
---
Some of these will of course be low power etc, but even so that's... rough napkin math... nine to ten thousand hours of bashing, I'd say? Roughly, at damage cap. Assuming no defenses. 
---
Yeah, that's not a thing that's going to happen.
---
something something wizard hat?
---
If a player invests the time in how the game works they should be on a fairly level playing field then
---
Go somewhere else. You whine too much. Then when the scary threat is gone, you can come back and do more carrier ratting. Find a safe level 3 mission for yourself... or a nice ice belt in high sec.
---
Also frt test war
---
Or you could just fit any tank on your ship and still act as an anti-tackle in shield fit while being able to get closer or fit any tank on armor fit and support your gang with point/web/neuts while still kiting at around 20/30 km. If you get forced off by a jackdaw+caracal in a HAC, you might want to rethink how you fit your ship.
---
I would be interested in this data.
---
I found out an IRL friend was a goon last year. It didn't change our friendship, I just felt bad for him.
---
When  you undock you consent to PvE.
---
It's not just goons. Other null blocs are joining
---
Try not to cringe when they say they are in tapi
---
Newly discovered space bodies to be named. (ALH84002, ALH84003,..........,ALH89008)
---
Good point, no.
---
Lol
---
Is that the rusted ruby skin?? Amazing job!
---
That's just the autism showing itself
---
You could have just said that you never joined a null corp.
---
Ah ok, fair enough!
---
Crazy right? I almost feel like 50% of people dont bother washing hands.
---
That is a lot!
---
They're an appealing alliance/coalition.
---
You can effectively turn off a gate in null with enough bubbles and a cloaky scout up the chain to tell you when someone gets in the chain, then it basically takes a wormhole opening in your system to get any risk
---
If this is "content" then hillmar made a game that really sucks
---
do you have a spare +4 implant ?
---
There are some beliefs in there I had before I joined a bloc.  For example, the "sperg".  It's minimal to non-existent.  The larger the bloc, the less there tends to be actually, mostly because how annoying it is gets multiplied up with the number of people doing it, so people who do it get splatted (also fleets have "no-chatter").
---
Losing your "identity" (whatever that means in an internet spaceship game) is also not really a thing.  Most blocs have some kind of minimum participation requirement - I mean why be in the bloc if you're not going to be at least a little useful.  Most are quite minimal though (sometimes participating is fun too, remember that).  You can disappear and do your own thing, appearing every now and then to get your regulation 30 rem.  
---
Is nullsec stagnant?  It depends who you are.  If you're Goons there's no threat anywhere right now, so fleets do feel somewhat meh, like nothing really matters a whole lot.  I doubt it feels stagnant to NC\PL, Frat, Tapi, Horde or GOTG.
---
Praise arithmos?
---
&gt; Every new players loves the idea of Super capitals because they sound badass, but the gameplay surrounding them is unfortunately very stale, risk averse, and boring. To get one you need to operate in null sec with large established groups, which means joining a big blob of other players doing the same boring thing. Trust me, this is not where the fun exists in Eve, and it hasn’t been that way in a long time. The reasons are numerous but that’s another conversation. 
---
So to put this into a simple analogy (This is only a very rough example) would it be fair to compare this aspect of Eve with the "grinding aspect" of WoW or a game like Civilisation?
---
&gt;The fun exists in places like WH space, low sec FW etc not because these mechanics or goals are better, but because you are more likely to find smaller groups or even the odd solo player to fight for and against. Small group play is where Eve shines, big blobs suck for everyone.
---
What specialism would you start out with to focus on this area of the game?
---
Problem is null risk vs rewards is broken. This is due to your CSM control and bad changes. Not only does it put pressure on you, it puts the risk back in null. Now if you want that dank profit, you have to work for it. Too much trouble? Move out of null and make it in WH, LS, HS. Don’t want to move? Suck it up buttercup.
---
&gt; (even though bob dudes loved the game overall, unlike goons)
---
People won't play the game they don't like. It's easy to paint someone as some cartoon villain that gets off spoiling shit no matter that it requires to waste your precious time doing things you hate.
---
Yeah, "ruin your game blah blah". I've heard that. Let's just just munch the narrative that gets thrown around, even if it's not aimed at bloc's members. Narrative it is nevertheless.
---
i agree. no need to 3x entropic sink it for a balanced gang scenario.
---
Thank God... that's 4.16t less of structure spam and capital blobs.
---
Can confirm, used to be highsecer, am just advanced rouge drone AI with shitposting capabilities
---
A case could be made that something has to be done gameplay wise when "the sandbox" is not really a sandbox anymore because of the immensely powerful groups.
---
*looks at Serenity*
---
How do you destroy a Titan? Can a group of friends with smaller ships come across a Titan group and destroy them in a random raid type of an attack?
---
As if PL is relevant enough to do anything about it these days.
---
it was a better listen than i expected
---
\+1
---
You have thoroughly disproved my points. Nobody should play eve unless they want to play in nulsec. Nobody gets an opinion on gameplay that doesn't affect them. No one should comment on things that they're ignorant of.
---
But wait, weren't you just telling me what alllllll the hi sec players want, and exactly what's wrong with their play style?
---
Cognitive. Dissonance. It is astonishing that you will slam someone else' right to speak about things they don't understand, while adopting a single unuanced pov and refusing to acknowledge that opinions about eve arnt reserved for the people who enjoy one facet of the game.
---
Caracal DPS ~300 x2 + 230dps jackdaw = Le'ts take 800dps.
---
Let me know any kity ship able to tank 800dps with 2k5+ms and 300dps+assault DC+60km firing range. And i'll refit. 
---
I play the Vedmak Armor &amp; Shield and the best fit after ~200kills with vedmak/ikitursa, untill you show me something revelant of your Triglavian cruiser pilot skills, i'm going to think my fit is good :). 
---
o/
---
I don’t get it. If people are densely packed, they should be able to protect their systems.
---
SPECIALISMS
---
Military experts are calling this a quality dad joke.
---
Woosh?
---
If this is the case i would actually recommend you to join a low calls wormhole corp that has a c3 static. Solo you are just a big target.
---
"Hey, this item we specifically intended to base inflation in our game is being hit by inflation. Better start artifically introducing it to the market so it doesn't get too expensive." This move would be CCP literally gifting the players cold hard cash. It's not happening.
---
Pm me too
---
Good for tears yes, but not a good mechanic regardless
---
Is it for "HS regions" or "HS systems? In other words, does this count include lowsec structures?
---
The thing is, in this case, they all firing in my lowest resist, so it's the worst case i've played and i'm still alive with a kill. So the experience proove that's a good fit against 2 cruises + 1 destroyer T3
---
Thank you! Mining sounds good as it can provide good yields and knowledge and it involves strategy and trading so an all around combination.
---
So a T1 Miningbarge! I think I have my starting point :)
---
If MCAV is your corp of choice, make sure to train ewar, and maybe put your alt in an ewar ship too. 
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
P.s. love you MCAV guys when you don't ewar blob
---
But I don't actually hold those beliefs. I was simply pointing out that people do, and that's one of the reasons people want to see the nulsec blocks broken up. I wasn't actually stating my feelings. 
---
I was specifically saying that a certain segment of the player base holds these truths to be self evident, and you acknowledge that you've heard those beliefs before. I'm genuinly confused haha.
---
&gt; peacocking
---
that has always been the perfect word to describe mittens though.
---
the actual work was always done by other people.
---
what nythcie meant is you cant rly support your gang in that fit other than dps and i have to agree. might aswell bring a 80km cerb at that point
---
That's definitely a theme that's been advised as a pathway to success.
---
My strategy is to specialise and use strategy to advance rapidly and use my time to the best tactical advantage. In a way I've already started the game here on the forum :)
---
So, what it is, limiting size or stopping people from shoving everyone into the same region? The latter actually limits the spread, making sure the entity is smaller on the map, and makes it easier to maintain required standing fleets to counteract drifters spawning around.
---
So how exactly drifter menace will ensure that people won't live in tight formations and not having the opposite effect?
---
Here for the info. Just started 2 days ago.
---
I am asking why people would play high sec, because I can not understand why people would choose to spend money monthly to have an inferior experience. The very reason I am asking this question is that I used to be a high sec player myself, until I realized exactly that. Which is also why I can't really understand their opinions about the game, as they have a myriad of other games to play that fix their problems. I also don't get to say I like XYZ about WHs, because I have no fucking clue about them. Similarly, hiseccers don't get a say in null mechanics, because they have no fucking clue about them.
---
I'll be patiently waiting to see any other big group actually doing something (while doubting even goons will, although boredom might help), laughing my ass off to "your highsec ivory towers" in the meantime.
---
I thought that was against Spectre policy?
---
I get the joke and the fact that you can exchange "Goons" with every other group in EVE
---
I'm sure sitting in super blobs pressing F1 because someone brought a corvette to your blue donut is *so* much more rewarding.
---
That's a lot of assumptions. But what we actually see is just NPC spawns necessitating solid defense of your null territory, regardless of where you live. And this is something you can achieve easier when you pack your stuff tightly.
---
Threat that can hit anywhere it wants is the opposite of what makes people spread out. Threat in general forces people to work together and make peace with each other to oppose the common enemy.
---
If CCP wanted people to live less compactly, they would go back to state of affairs as they were in 2013, when systems could simply not support more than a few people harvesting there.
---
For Exploration have a look at [Signal Cartel](https://www.signalcartel.com/)
---
~~PL~~ MC* lmao
---
Can’t wait for ccp to ban ganking is HS.
---
True story.
---
Like "-" being part of the 3 characters you needed to be able to search.
---
Caught on a gate.
---
You spelt PanFam wrong.
---
*Arithmos Tyrannos would like to know your location*
---
I was referencing up to the "people opting out of nullsec" rather than new / not bitter.
---
err what? like 80% of all capsuleer ships in the game are literally empire, what is the issue? just because they werent "player buildable stations" doesn't mean their models couldn't be used as a base for new ones. What even is your point
---
With my point i'm able to keep a point at 36km (no boost) without any problem, as i mentionned, no matter the range because they were firing with missils and it's the worst case i can encounter
---
Hi able to keep a point at 36km (no boost) without any problem, as i mentionned, no matter the range because they were firing with missils and it's the worst case i can encounter, I'm dad.
---
I guess he meant that it's not mechanics that hard, it's hard to know them all and use to your advantage. And it's not like there's full actual guide that will help.
---
So you have to learn them on practice, be taught by someone, or be good at searching and understanding.
---
but if you're in the middle of prosecuting a war - you're not at home, you're in somebody else's home.
---
They already "fixed" them (in their opinion) so it will probably take another 6 years until they look at wardecs again.
---
Then you’re space isn’t defended. What military you know of that deploys their entire forces leaving their home wide open?
---
Do you think giant empires like goons are bad but also compacted empires are also bad?
---
Und such dir eine Nullsec oder Sov-Corp der du beitreten kannst. Dort lernst du am meisten und die Mining-ausbeute ist deutlich besser als im highsec.
---
"Inflict suffering" - Heh, not angry at all. Well, if this hurts actual new player retention in any way, why not ban all accounts in GSF that have access to wallet and critical alliance assets? That would generate salt that would overfill the Pacific.
---
Some time ago Goons, PH and TAPI came to an agreement to stop fighting over the high sec dominance and just split the profit. The real reason behind the recent "burn high sec" campaign is to get rid of some larger industry players and secure the monopoly not only on plex market (which they already have), but also on T2 ships/components market. The drifters narration is just something they tell line members to get them involved. The truth is that this campaign was prepared before and is purely for the money (but who would want to fight for that).
---
You made the same point I've been considering. 
---
How many mechanics are there for smaller groups to maybe seize the moment and grab a foothold?
---
Not really any. From this perspective the drifters are a start but we need more. 
---
Not so much more NPC's as a force for shaking things up, but as a catalyst for players to do so.
---
I met an Eve player IRL once.
---
It was kind of weird, we had this really great talk about the state of nullsec, space politics and past wars, etc. Everyone else at the table just occasionally looked at us like we had a mental disability.
---
Make space dangerous again, amirite?
---
99% of corps you'll see will state that they do all, small-mid-large-scale, piracy, wormholes, anomalies, shark tornadoes in snowy mountains...
---
But truth is that most of them lie and will not provide anything interesting.
---
Just join any corp you like and see if you enjoy being in it. If you not - leave and chose another, or create your own.
---
(and remember, best content is content made by yourself)
---
Eve is a complicated game with many things to do.
---
Some things, like exploration and industry, you can get into and make some money fairly quickly.
---
Others, like PVP or missioning, can be money sinks and are more skill intensive.
---
As a solo player, you WILL be confronted to PVP whatever your activity is and as a new player, your only options will be to escape if you can or, most probably, die and lose some of your income.
---
This is why it is advised to get in a Corp to make up for your lack of skills and money with numbers. That is until you can get your skills high enough to do your own thing but this will take months just to be able to pilot a t2 frigate.
---
A Titan is not worth 3000$ but the skills to be able to pilot it will take you years to grind or a lot of skill injectors. Fortunately, you don't need a Titan to have fun.
---
I think part of the fun of EVE is actually the fact that you start with nothing but with patience, research and some work, you can make it big. The variety of goals you can aim for and ways to get there is what makes this game unique.
---
So if you play this game to compete with veterans, don't, you will burn out quickly. However if you play to slowly build your pilot, forge your own path and make friends along the way, welcome!
---
you must be new,
---
this is literally the problem - if nobody leaves home because they constantly have to be at home... there will be no more nullsec wars.
---
Yeah, his fights are something else! Bjorn Bee takes Rorqs out as battle Rorqs in the past, you can find those videos on YouTube as well!
---
?
---
But... that's not really happening. It's annoying for Citadel gunners, sure (which is a tiny fraction of the population)... Really the only thing it did was make a war end a little earlier than it might have.
---
It seems Mittani and the wizards hat has become the Godwins Law of /r/eve
---
I second this. Especially with plex market prices where they're at, it's a way better use of time to just work an hour or two of OT per month instead of grinding for hours IMO
---
Research indicates jokes like this are killing eve and infuriating the drifters.
---
I don't get it
---
&gt;&gt; advance rapidly and use my time to the best tactical advantage
---
To do what exactly? Even in you other thread you don't state what exactly you want to achieve. You just want to be among the best. But there are many ways to be seen as good in this game. There is no trump all card.
---
Just move along it will all be over with shortly.
---
None of that is even remotely a problem. Drifter fleets do jack, cloaky campers can either be ignored, or only drop on shiny things and at least we don't have any activity requirements aside from logging in ever 1 or 2 months. Not to mention you'd probably get kicked for selling things with a 60% markup.
---
.......that not how it works. The United States Marines Corps has a duty section of 25% of its personnel guarding its bases at ALL times. They deployed all the time too. So you either don’t know how to properly deploy to protect the rear or you have too much space. In eve, CCP clearly stated years ago “we want to make null small group oriented. We want to make it to where you have to live and protect your space to own it”.
---
You're lucky to have good players flying with you ;) 
---
I tought you pvp
---
You want him to prove a negative?
---
People without structures of their own.
---
My hands are not that dirty!
---
I’m sure the smaller ns entities that don’t have 1000s of citadels share your cry’s over the 100s of pings. Or maybe they don’t since they didn’t shit up their space with a citadel for every moron in their group. 
---
I know your pinhead can’t consider anything beyond what mittens has told you but some ns entities haven’t been hit nearly as hard. I would encourage you to look beyond “how can we spin this as is being victims” and see there might be other reasons
---
PS, I’m not illiterate, you however are still an asshat.
---
Wait, you mean your toilet stall door?
---
There is a huge difference between how people react to the drifters on reddit and in game.
---
I couldn´t log in the first few days of the drifter "invasion" but read about it on reddit.
---
As i logged in the first time i was expecting chaos, rage, constant defense fleets, brainstorming for new tactics.
---
....but: nothing, same people talking the same shit as usual.
---
95% of the people don´t care and i actually tried to find some drifters to see what\`s goin on and gave up after 20 jumps. Too boring.
---
Stravagor i hate you you noob
---
That's it, I wasn't sure about the subreddit link rules so I didn't link it at the time.
---
200mil to the one who get's me it's killmail
---
They really need to follow up on timers to be anything but an annoyance. Also, they should make them an incursion style thing in my opinion. No cynos in system, focus there, some sort of reward for killing them, last 2 week's if unopposed
---
We play Eve. We probably do.
---
Lul. Your scope isnt far enough to effect us little bee.
---
Is the purpose.purely an FC ship?
---
Virtue pod, max scanning skills... do 8au scans around celestials. Ignore gas sights and relic/data sights, scan all the other sigs at 2au... should be able to 2 pass any signature. Also bind the decrease/increase probe range to a button.
---
It's only the circle because people are too stupid to learn from the past.
---
Risk averse pvp boi!
---
Set probes to 4 au
---
Center on a celestial (which has sigs nearby)
---
Scan
---
Set probes to 1 au
---
center on each sig you "hit" correctly
---
scan again
---
(repeat until you're done)
---
That's about it, I set my range change hot keys to my 4 and 5th mouse buttons and then use B to scan, so I can do that faster.
---
If you have a huge scan strength you can sometimes do better than that, and I know at some point in the pass I heard rumors that with a high scan strength and a single RSS probe you could use the numbers to identify the type of signature (but I'm not sure if that was true or still works)
---
i've seen countless FRT, (now fire), and pretty much every other alliance smaller than them(mine included) ignoring shield timers cause its meaningless, its just a timer setter. This is a criticism of people treating it as if you did nothing it would go into hull and all your services would be stopped or some dumb shit, hell they don't even seem to follow up on 90% of the timers (if at all).
---
they're doing that because its easy to just get one nerd gunning repel it, which seems to be the only thing you need really for most of them. Shield timers hardly are reacted to under normal circumstances.
---
&gt;In eve, CCP clearly stated years ago “we want to make null small group oriented. We want to make it to where you have to live and protect your space to own it”.
---
great - but if everyone's living and protecting, body is out raiding and pillaging.
---
Autism. It's the gamer gene.
---
no, the door to leave the toilets.
---
sorry i'm from the uk, it's just a toilet - we don't call it a bathroom. there's no bath in the room.
---
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:150755
---
The remainder is your actual player skill in scanning.
---
I mean, its pretty easy. You realize the vast majority of minerals, reactable materials, and PI stuff need to run the industry in eve comes from null sec correct? So, if the null sec alliances are true to their word and form a cartel that turns of the spigot of production materials to high sec industry... high sec will burn, but not in the way you are thinking.
---
&gt;Also bind the decrease/increase probe range to a button
---
Isn't Ctrl-MouseWheel already the standard for that?
---
ASCEE is recruiting... [https://ascee.goonfleet.com/](https://ascee.goonfleet.com/)
---
Yes, because you silly fucks just run shit, right? How many people do you think would actually even give a shit?
---
Drifters need to siege null, let them spawn in every staging system, and even roam around using gates.
---
Oh, and as one universe puts it, "LET THE GALAXY BURN!"
---
Projecting*
---
What bullshit. I would be pissed. Tho you shouldn’t gate a rorq lol
---
Is aryth the one in orange?
---
Well first, you will have to pay for a subscription because alpha clones cannot access t2 ships and t1 can't compete with them unless outnumbered.
---
Then you will need the core skills, called the magic 14, to at least level 4. This will take about 1 month for an Omega clone and twice that for alpha (I don't think alpha can access all of them).
---
T2 ships require 2 or 3 skills at 5 which takes another month. 
---
So in about 2 months of specialized training you will be able to pilot a t2 frigate.
---
Eventually you will want the magic 14 at 5 which take a total of 120 days.
---
The only exceptions to that are exploration frigates, wich you can pilot at day 1 and still do decently.
---
From there (4-5 months) you can decide what you like and which ship is worth training for the next month.
---
Are you using implants? The "Prospector" series help with scanning, and there should be about a dozen npc corps per faction that can sell them to you. Or just hit up Jita for a set
---
uf U no wut 1t meeenz, itz a werd
---
Cos we don't have one right now
---
Those stats are fake, because losses are not included.
---
Nullsec players already do maintenence comparable to that, this is more on top of that.
---
&gt;Maybe 2 weeks now of game time and I activated my omega on the premise that in 3 months I can be either self-sustaining buying PLEX using ISK or close to that.
---
This is guaranteed to make you hate the game by turning it into a job that pays far less than the lowest minimum wage in the western world.
---
Talking with CCP Amino at Eve North, the citadel skins havent happened because of the simple issue that "Who owns the skin?", if a player owns the skin it would only be visible when that particular player is gunning. And coding "alliance skins" is problematic for multiple reasons. Thats why we dont have them yet.
---
I feel like, if the drifters were actually popping stations, this would be a hayday for merc corps. Seriously.   
---
"You wanna go to war, but afraid that drifters are gonna be popping structures behind your back? Hire us today, we'll defend your space for a nominal fee, leaving you free to do whatever the hell you please."
---
\*sigh\* A man can dream....
---
250mil to the one who get me the Corps of Frank !

Please don't tell you want to pvp. You want to shit on defenseless targets maybe. Or you want killmails. Or you want to participate in a big war or battle. But you wouldn't be in a megacoalition offering club med activities if you were looking for pvp.
---
Yes it is
---
I hope you collected them and listed them for sale on the market!
---
Go to the gym it helps
---
This except actually. All CCP did was create an uninteractive, unrewarding event.
---
It seems you can get both sides. It's the same with WoW you can do solo quests or you can focus on team game play.
---
Every station is different, but your vision isn't clear enough to see them
---
I don’t think that is the only form of grinding. Basically most ways of earning isk involve grinding, but some paths use combat skills and some don’t. No matter what direction you choose, you will need to grind. But earning a super capital is something else and it’s mind-numbingly tedious with very little action in between. If that sounds okay to you then go for it.
---
Personally if I were to start and was interested in combat specialisation, I’d invest in the combat skills like gunnery and ship skills (perception and willpower), plus engineering skills etc (intelligence and memory).
---
I like your "don't settle" strategy. There probably are corp with reputations for certain activities which can be researched presumably
---
a full set of virtues will make a big difference, with t2 mods, rigs, covops 5 and virtues a scanning ship will get slightly above 200 points in strenght. 8 au where sigs are, ignore what you dont need once its beyond 25%. When you get a sig that could be in 2 places after a scan, the right spot is always the one thats further from the middle of your probes

This, take my upvote

Best idea is to make them on par with normal reps in terms of hp/s, but having a hull rep equipped sets your HULL resistances to 0%. Tada!
---
 ARRETEZ DE TRIKITER SAMOTH :'(
---
Pretty sure most alliances have channel / mailing list to do that
---
Hey, supers are more complicated than that
---
Making sure you hit "Jump To" instead of "Bridge To" does not count as "more complicated"
---
I was hoping ccp would do that
---
Are the Goons literally bashing their own structures so they don't end up on Drifter killmails?  OMG, that is rich if true.
---
You're welcome.
---
It was dran. I actually don't know if he's the ceo or what.
---
Log in and look for yourself if this completely unsustained rumor only you heard about is true.
---
Actually I am in Horde. Leaving a nullbloc is a lot of hassle and takes time.

Maybe ask your alliance?

Now get some magnets and an arduino and make it float!

---
I got recognised on my University campus once. It was the cringiest thing I've ever experienced, as none of my Uni friends knew how big of a nerd I was, then some dude just runs up and calls me "Jin'taan".
---
If that's how you feel about Goons, then you should peel your skin after meeting a player from PIRAT.
---
I resisted to make that exact same joke for 5 hours....
---
:) I know toy said you had to tweak the file to make it work correctly wonder what you change
---
This is the only problem I have. I like the content and I like that it's different, but it's not "intelligent" at all. They just assault the same locations at the same times every day. We've taken to just getting a fleet of Corms together and killing them that way -- virtually no risk (took down 60 of them in one hunt yesterday and lost like...500m of ships total across like 100 people).
---
It would be different if they were going after botters or attempting to come back and hit the timers, but they're not.
---
Not really. A proper fit astra can be hard to kill for an inexperienced group if manned. 
---
Much worse in low with bombs but ya.
---
&gt; I too make assumptions and pretend like i'm not a Lemming and do Le Grr Goons.
---
lemming? no, i assuredly do the grr goons however. Also please this aint 9gag(well its reddit so not much better but still)
---
&gt;My entire post was made on the assumption of a brainless Super Ratter
---
this was the "context"
---
&gt; &gt; Why would you rat in range of NPC stations without an Umbrella is the real question... Are you retarded? Go ahead and be an easy frag i guess?
---
sure doesn't seem to narrow it down all that much to just brainless super ratters. Also even brainless super ratters should be capable of using dscan.
---
&gt; And yes, apparently to your surprise the Inhib gets anchored when the Super is just about to land on-grid, the cyno isn't prelit before it initiates warp
---
the inhib starts to get anchored after the super enters warp, you stay on the site with the sabre and keep dscanning, drop it once he reaches a certain AU depending on how much buffer you want to bubble and cyno... and that's if you're using dreads, if you're using supercarriers and carriers you cyno at range and instapop the in cyno anyway unless particularly low on numbers. Of course you generally don't light the cyno before it initiates warp lmao
---
mining is something you can learn in under an hour if you have more than 2 working braincells  
---
stop telling newbies to mine holy fuck its the most braindead boring activity you can do in EVE and burns out so many new players that get stuck with it
---
Now see, thats where you are wrong. PIRAT members behave IRL as they do ingane, never leave the comfort of their home/station, so there is no danger of ever meeting one.
---
did he mention that you spent hundreds of hours doing unpaid volunteer work for an incompetent company for 3 years?
---
Non aligned at the moment
---
Pfftt you lie
---
Currently at work :/ and asking a collective of minds can achieve the same result much much faster lol.
---
BUBBLE UP
---
also 
---
ikitursa is trash sadly
---
It's low effort, sir, but it checks out.
---
As soon as logi is involved, you might as well stop shooting in highsec. It's a bit better if your structure is able to deploy fighters
---
I think the best buff would be to give them a huge bonus to repair amount if you have no weapons timer or something like that.
---
That's why you gotta name your toon something coool like *poon slayah*
---
True on the button height, weird way to state it in your original post.
---
HARD disagree on the four-in-hand. This is such a common misconception, especially an American one. Would like to see you tell [the Prince Edward](https://d3hp8xnxb3lun4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/morning-dress-morning-coat-the-rake-king-edward.jpg) on his damn *wedding day* that he's not "completed the outfit".
---
Ties are meant to be a bit irreverent. Symmetrical knots are what you wear if you're trying too hard. Some people can get away with them anyway, but the four-in-hand is always, always a safe and correct choice.
---
its boring , doesnt pay much and you wont learn much about the game besides how to become a bitter higshec miner 
---
even running highsec missions is more engaging content as it actually involves pressing buttons now and then and you might learn a bit about application and specific resists while running those 
---
start out with L2 and L3 missions in a T1 cruiser or battlecruiser and work your way up into a battleship for L4 missions 
---
you should join an alliance that provides you with help  and ships/skillbooks 
---
your best bet if you wanna do "everything" would be a nullblob but EVE Uni and RvB are both good choices to start out with EVE and learn something besides mining (theres not much knowledge or strategy involved and it will burn you out fast if you do it as main activity )
---
embrace the geek within you !
---
I'm sorry that I really love this game and want to help CCP improve it. 
---
My bad man, I'll try and be cool and disinterested in my favourite hobby next time, eh?

---
mittens will have you kicked from whatever shithole of a alliance your in for disrespecting ~his people~
---
You know how sometimes you go into a public toilet and discover that some fucknuckle has shit everywhere but in the toilet? Welcome to r/eve. That's where you are asking for advice...
---
&gt;Yeah, that's not a thing that's going to happen.
---
But since most of them will be undefended, you don't have to blob every structure - you can easily split the bash groups into the smallest squads required to hit the cap, so it's 10,000 "bashsquad hours", which is a lot more practical depending on the size of your denominator/number of bashsquads.
---
Not to say that it WILL happen, but there are definitely strategies for division of labor that make it a lot more possible than assuming it's one blob grinding for 10,000 hours.
---
But... nobody has even suggested burning down every citadel in HS.  Most of them aren't even doing anything.  I'd think it's more likely that they'd target ECs in high manu index systems.
---
but did he mention it though?
---
If the point is to make the null empires a bit more vulnerable to harassment from smaller groups, this seems pretty hamfisted. I would have liked to see station services, modules and rigs made vulnerable to hit-and-run attacks, so a group doesn't have to ref the entire structure twice before the owner experiences any adverse effects. A team of bombers should be able to swoop in, disable the main gun on a Fortizar and disappear. Maybe the component isn't even destroyed, but requires a few hours and repair paste or fuel to be put back online.
---
We wouldn't even need to find it, just knock the dust off. Back before there were standings, we had a system to do this automatically. Some folks forget that standings were added later specifically to compensate for the advantage that our scheme gave us.
---
If there is such thing this subreddit will blow up

Structures are not meant to defend them selves on there own. They add a huge dynamic when you have an enemy fleet and a citadel to fight.

---
Thanks for the replies. Awesome as always!
---
So it seems like I can expect an improvement with more skills/mods/rigs/implants (even if it seems like returns diminish as your scan strength grows)
---
— So two passes to get 100% for most sigs is quite achievable, correct?
---
— Any idea roughly what the baseline scan strength for achieving two passes is? (Surely there’s a point where you’re just not going to get it any quicker?) 
---
— I should be scanning at 4 or 8 au around celestial, rather than centre of sig spheres
---
Do you speak of the black hand? RL Social engineering and doxxing the shit out of EVE for a decade
---
I see articles periodically about the AI of EVE and its ongoing application. Is it possible the drifters were designed to "learn" as time goes on.  They are just currently to stupid to know what timers are and eventually will start taking down structures?
---
I don't play this game, I just come to this Reddit and laugh at you.
---

all of you, OUT!

If ccp keeps this up we'll reach "brisc being banned" level salt this week. Probably "briac being unbanned" level salt if this keeps going for the whole month.
---
Conservative estimates.
---
Goons pack up and go home when faced with equal or greater firepower. More news at 11
---
So as others have said try not to grind your sub every month unless you know how to make 2b+ every month. A lot of players that isk for sub know how to run all the pve or have a neiche like a c5 wh, trading they know how to make more than they need.
---
Its easy if you know what your doing and have a ship to run everything. Which can be another 1-3b. So after the three months you might be in a position to do it. If you beline training for something like a tengu/loki or rattlesnake.
---
My suggestion is to drop mining entirely unless you just passive afk it and have another toon which I doubt you do. Go into pi and pve/pvp. Pi4 is enough to get you a good 500-1b a month with good managment more. Get a serious explo pve ship for your region and grind r/d/ded sites. A t3 is great for this loki, tengu Or grind c3 sites.
---
The point is dont mine for your sub unless you already plan on doing something else. Dont train exhumer. Until theyre rebalanced an Orca is pretty much better which leads to rorq which again dont doooo etttt its boring. Do something fun be active.
---
Whaaat?? lol
---
supers are cancer, rorqs are cancer, citadels are cancer..
---
and apparently drifters are cancer... but why should we just get rid of one of them?
---
I enjoy that we have no clue what the Drifters are up to. That's how it is supposed to be
---
Is this modern art?
---
Oh thanks I will definitely look at that :) Are players only allowed to join one group at a time or can you simultaneously join several?
---
CCP games has no eggs to reset maps. 
---
They can't do it all things, null space ally and thier pets fear lost assets.
---
...."pilots" always will be whine: no content, game over bla bla bla, but when ccp present new great content (for example Incarna) this is "brave" capsulir can only whine: oh no, omg, we lost space aaaa we all dead, mayday, mayday. lol.
---
WTF, NPC kill mah ship, I thought NPC are just there to be afk farmed and pose no threat to spodbrain gameplay ...
---
Fair enough, then.
---
goons do that too as well NC and others
---
You destroy it with a big bunch other capital ships, generally. A small group of smaller ships wouldn't even make a dent, especially as the titan would call for help and then you'd have all  sorts of ships on your butt. Alas, this isn't "Star Wars: A New Hope" ;)
---
Let's be honest this "invasion" is very most likely a world event and not a permanent PvE feature. That being said, it's obviously designed to be a pain in the ass for NS alliances, which is IMO fine as long as it's a world event and not a permenant feature.
---
r/eve is currently turbo circlejerking at how great it is to fuck up NS alliances, purely because it fuck up alliances because GRRR NS I guess although half of them already don't play the game because of how NS is boring and would even less so if this stays. 
---
Eve and NS need easier content creation and more players explosions, not more boring forced PvE that might kill a jump gate or a rorqual per week.
---
How are you enjoying it so far? I've decided to commit to a paid account as I did a short trial a few years ago.
---
CCPls introduce an option to report a corp or alliance as a bot, **because fuck Gemini White United**.
---
reading is still hard still
---
 he is on about all goons dissapearin
---
I couldn't agree more. When we have an imbalance in the game that favors one style of game play though, something must be done. I am grateful that CCP is doing something and shaking things up.
---
Hey, I remember when wrecking machine hit a random travel Astra of ours. We decided to actually show up and we were so upset about the blue balls we killed the Astra ourselves right in front of you whilst staring you down.
---
That was fun.
---
Shitposting on /r/eve = playing Eve.
---
He might be stating it in an unpleasant way. but Nythcie/Kronos Ritual are some of the better pilots in the game and understand fitting.  
---
You're videos very well made but the point of your ship should be able to hold grid and actually ramp damage without having to leave when you take any damage.  
---
A Cerberus can tank 900-1200 DPS with a poors fit that does over 2kms and applies perfectly to pretty much everything except interceptors and a 94km damage application range of around 500 DPS ( you basically 1 clip anything sub 25k EHP ) You can 4-5 cycle most AF's and the reload's not that bad.  
---
It's a better anti-support platform. So is the orthrus, So is the OSprey Navy issue.  
---
They're not calling you bad just suggesting you could do a lot more with a much better fit without being forced off. The strength is the ramp. Ramping means holding grid. Holding grid means either avoiding damage ( sig tanking ) or flat out being able to face tank the damage ( actually having tank )  
---
otherwise, it's a subpar anti-support platform that costs like 3x what you should spend.  
---
Like fly what you want and have fun dude. they're just suggesting a better fit politely and given their experience with the game i'd listen.  
---
Watching the video, going through your killboards and actually looking at the use case. tbh it's mainly farming kills off bads or your ships role on grid was largely irrelevant or could have done far more with a far more helpful ship ( multiple instances of you getting outdamaged by an oracle, caracal or orthrus case in point.)  
---
Your videos well made and the pilotings decent so props and have an upvote.
---
what's the point of the CSM anyway? isn't CCP just running this to appease the eve demographic too full of themselves to just play the game without being in charge?
---
we'd probably be better off without them, they don't represent us anyway.
---
&gt;Let's be honest this "invasion" is very most likely a world event and not a permanent PvE feature. 
---
Shhh dont tell them. This is nullsec life now, it's all ruined, pls wage war on highsec.
---
keep drifters, delete rorquals
---
We have no clue what they are up too because it's (very most likely) just a world event made by CCP to make it like "uh look NPC are threatening even players !" for the introduction to trig invasion in NS.
---
kk thanks. I'll talk to my CEO about us joining an alliance.
---
One Corp per character. But Signal Cartel has a public channel(EvE-Scout) where you can ask about  .. quite everything except PVP. Well you can ask about PVP as well, but there are better corps/channels for that.
---
thats why they deployed to Hisec now ... :thonkerguns:
---
perhaps... unpopular opinion I know, but perhaps ask CCP to actually do their job and ban bots rather than crucifying alliances for not doing the job for them?
---
This  is ccp's game, and they should be one the enforcing the rules.

HS is basically NS controlled and the only place where Goons massive super fleet won't turbo win any fight.
---
not gonna happen.
---
I was trying to give more of a general view of the type of game-style that I prefer in order to hopefully select a path most suitable. Mining, exploration and trading are specific areas I'd like to focus on. I need to research the specific activities more as I'm not able to be specific enough.
---
&gt;Start with a T1 Miningbarge and then scope out all the aspects the Game has to offer.
---
lol not my problem they don't listen to me
---
Pfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt

I bet naming the char "My one true love" would have better prevented this guy from yelling it across the campus ....

one of the biggest issues is corp paranoia, api checks, forced voice and all that "why so serious" shit. if you have to take a medical check in order to get a chance to play wild west, only a fraction of the people even bother.
---
More boohoo.  I doubt this is going to last very much longer it's lore based and part of the lore world events and not something permanent.  Pretty much you just gotta "deal with it" and suck it up.

Live at 5, The Wisconsin Dept. of Transportation is reporting the state's salt storage depots are over capacity, alternate arrangements should be made for future shipments.

Does that make NPSI panfam bitches? because you cant achieve anything without their FCs and line members to teach the masses how to press f1?
---
How is it "punitive" lol it's content. It doesn't have to "solve" anything, except adding more to the game.
---
There may \*be\* some PvE lore, we just don't know yet. The Triglavian and Drifters are ancient enemies, so it stands to reason it all goes hand-in-hand with the recent Trig content.
---
It's basically a group to be in if you don't wanna be in a noob corp in Goons, Test, or Horde, and you don't have a contact with NCPL. You get lots of content when defending home space for Frat. It's honestly pretty fun.
---
How about DARKNESS. just removes their docking rights so they don't have safe haven?
---
After the tutorial the game sends you to some career agents. Those give an overview of the game activities.
---
There is also [this image](https://eve-guides.fr/images/wtd.jpg). It's a bit outdated and abyssal PVE and PVP are missing, but it shows how much variety Eve has.
---
I'm interested in PVP but most likely would prefer the strategic type of gameplay such as exploration, mining, trading. I'll research more about Eve "in-game" which is why I've researched the basics here.
---
Someone mentioned you can create cities or Citadels? I'm not sure if that was available when I did a trail but I like the idea of the city building or civilisation building in space!

Also, just saw below you said it took up 3/4 of a roll...did you make it 100% solid interior? I've printed 7" Nidhoggurs and they used maybe 10% of that amount.
---
You do not recognize the bodies in space.
---
So basically your pissed that the drifters aren't doing your job?
---
If you want to hunt bots, destroy citadels and evict the blue donut, gather some like minded players and start shooting.
---
The "great" new AI has been released like 3 years ago. It still cant do basic tasks like destroying a structure. In my opinion CCP is again talking big, but delivering very little.
---
[Jesus christ.](https://i.imgur.com/RHcouOs.png) The rorqs are all battle fit, but still... that's a lot of isk lost in a week.

Most of us that have been playing a while are still bad, so no.
---
&gt; so many new players that get stuck with it
---
That's something I remember! If you start something and don't fully realise all the pros and cons you may end up investing a lot of your time only to find out it's not what you really want to do or it's not giving you enough of a financial return.
---
A bit like going to study biology for 4 years  at university only to find after the 2 year you don't like it! It's better to research first and make the best decision. You make a good point. Although some people have said mining is the most profitable?
---
BUBBLE UPPP
---
I’m pretty sure your university friends know how much of a nerd you are. We’ve all seen you wear the cringiest of clothes.
---
Across the entire game that's nothing. In reality it's probably like 50mil per affected player, on average. There have been a few Supers lost out of stupidity/afk, but really it's not that big of a deal.
---
Upwell Structures (Citadel, Engineering Complex, Refinery and some Sov stuff) are a thing. Placing one is quite easy, but mainly only useful for a group (you also need a player corp to drop one). And producing them needs a wide variety of industry skills (i.e. multiple players or some alts) if you want to do all of the production chain.
---
Actually they lost numbers recently from the ccp purge. The increase in numbers is from 1.5-2k eu/ustz players from BL/SkillU/Volta etc
---
not sure if you understood. but basically noone wants to BUY a DED site from an ''enemy''/neut. no1 can guarantee its not a bait.
---
thus only alliance or corpmates will eventually buy them
---
&gt;even running highsec missions is more engaging content as it actually involves pressing buttons now and then and you might learn a bit about application and specific resists while running those  
---
&gt;start out with L2 and L3 missions in a T1 cruiser or battlecruiser and work your way up into a battleship for L4 missions  
---
&gt;you should join an alliance that provides you with help and ships/skillbooks
---
You make an excellent point! This is why I came here to do a little bit of research because that's what the trial taught me that it's better to research a little bit to make good choices so that you make the best investment of your time during the learning curve.
---
What type of core do you join for the L2 and L3 missions and to get a license for a T1 cruiser or a battlecruiser?

*laughs at autism*
---
This is what players should have been doing all along. When a bloc like Imps deploys, you harass TF out of their home. Reinforcing anything and everything. Destroy their PVE'ing... 
---
Is it like some unwritten code between the douche blocs to not do this??
---
He's prolly just multiboxing

Shhh, dont ruin the dinobrain narrative.

It is always fun to watch people sperg about all the other entities botting, when they made a shitton of isk protecting omist...

---
what the fuck has this game become
---
Serious question but which part of this image shows botting?
---
It's not random, if you'd even read the post. They're specifically being "sent" to targeted systems where known strongholds are, just relentlessly. The hub for Horde gets hit pretty constantly -- it's not a problem, considering Horde's numbers in the area, but it's an annoyance. If they were hitting all areas equally it would be one thing, since it \*would\* clear out botters/renters/etc... but at this point it's just throwing Drifters at people so they have to defend instead of doing other content.
---
&gt;ccp doing their job
---
nice meme m9
---
Nobody really knows, and only sort-of...the Drifters don't come back specifically to hit timers on structures, but they come often enough that they could potentially destroy something if nobody had defended the reinforce.

That was "trolling" and understand it's real common around these parts. Since you missed that, I'll just go ahead and explain the rest. The lack of evidence happens to be equal evidence for my initial supposition as it is the individual's who I originally replied to - commenting on the lack of bot kills. That was the funny part, the call for evidence that was already on hand, but not particularly valid, because we're just spit-ballin' ideas round there parts.

"They are flying VNIs, therefore they are bots"
---
This has always annoyed me. A VNI multiboxer with Near2 (or one that isn't afk) is virtually indistinguishable from a bot.
---
"But lol they all warped as soon as I entered system"
---
Motherfucker they've been keeping an eye on you for the past 3 jumps, it doesn't take super-human reflexes to click a button once you enter local.
---
Bots exist, but all this baseless finger-pointing is not only stupid, it's counter-productive. If people put just a little bit of effort into avoiding false positives, maybe CCP might take these reports a little more seriously.
---
I guess it's just easier to think you failed to tackle them because of they're robots. You sound like the dude who gets accuses people of wall hacks when he gets killed in call of duty.

Gotta say I think r/eve has hit new lows this week in terms of what content is allowed.
---
I’d rather chop my hands off if he was a ncpl
---
And what takes 2 hours to listen to takes half an hour to read - is there a transcript or a properly written up version?
---
I’m confused
---
now, im not a NS member. i dont hate any NS member or IF i do, i hate everyone equally.
---
im just amused how so many NS member sperg out if something doesnt pay out in their favour. there are playstile that die out/suffer extremely with current gamemechanics like solo/smallgang, blops, basically everyone not affiliated with big blocks. 
---
but hey, no1 fucking cares. the only thing they had to hear was ''adapt or die'', HTFU and so on..
---
so for once its the other way around.. the ''big guys'' get fucked over just like the ''small'' ones got countless times over the last few years.
---
i dont think drifters are a great mechanic but nonetheless i like them. WHY? i hope that players start to look at what is healthy for the game and cry for balances based on that. not just for what suits them best or pays out in their favour.
---
what do you think the ratio of multiboxed vni toons to vni bots is?
---
you're an idiot
---
It would  most likely require a complete redesign on how ship combat works in EVE, but the idea of shifting more power to the one side with incoming damage would definitely add to the combat of EVE

&gt;  100-man blobs

100 man fleet isn't a blob.
---
&gt; to encourage splitting up into smaller squads
---
Never going to happen for the simple reason splitting off also mean loosing mutual protection, logi protection, etc
---
&gt; using small ships to fly under the enemy's guns
---
Flying a small ship into an enemy blob is basically a death sentence

https://zkillboard.com/corporation/1000274/stats/ - So far they have killed 0 citadels, with the only losses being 1 cyno and 1 jump gate.

I doubt it will last more then a week before changing in some way, it's a lore event not an actual purge of players from nullsec. It's supposed to put the actual fear of god into nullsec players, and has probably vastly exceeded expectations. Personally I figure it's time for nullsec to be collateral damage, god knows any eve lore/rp people still sticking with the game have earned the live event on a grand scale in spades.
---
sadly this
---
No, but I got some drugs for that
---
 "The majority of the player base is fucking retarded"
---
said the biggest of all
---
The guy didn't just leave his VNI's out to die, so clearly a bot.
---
Generally speaking you're right. In this particular case tho, fuck Gemini Whale United, you'd struggle to find a single actual human player in there. They: 
---
\- do not respond in local, ever;
---
\- live in Fade on the Cloud Ring border: cloud ring is a separate region and they have no intel on that, still they warp the second you enter local;
---
\- exclusively fly VNIs: like, I fly there from time to time to go fuck with the GME pocket and I never saw a non VNI ship in dscan.
---
\- sport this fancy killboard:  [https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99008988/](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99008988/) 
---
While none of the above is conclusive evidence of botting, there's a 99,9% chance that GWU is, in fact, full of bots and worth looking into by CCP.
---
Would be fine if that happens to LowSec and HiSec also... Spawnen in every System, attacking Citas and Players and camping gates.
---
But in Lowsec and Hisec there are only "invasion" systems so you can avoid them.
---
So yeaha, if drifters dont come to hisec do give all the hisec carebears the same feeling as every nullsec alliance now - hopefully goons deploymend starts asap. :-)
---
I thought that's what Init was rebranding to?
---
That is fair but I can see where goons are coming from. The infrastructure in delve is an athanor on every moon plus a fort/keep for ratters + whatever else and you leave them alone they’ll ref an obscene amount of structures.
---
If they happen to turn up at the exact right time for the armor timer (which if always left alone will eventually happen...one day) then you’ll get structures put into armor and jobs turned off etc so they feel the need to stop them.
---
Flair checks out.
---
You can add a couple more factors, like the inability to miss when firing into a big blobb of ships (if there is a certain amount of ships in that general area, you are very likely to hit *something* (without the need to have it target locked)
---
pieplan
---
so you are saying CCP is trying to fight cancer with even more cancer?
---
KK I get it. I'd be concerned about it being a trap also.
---
How is being forced to PVE with shit loot content? oh and forced to run around to save structures?  Tell me how that is content for the average 0.0 pilot. This is stupid.
---
The issue is the "big guys" aren't fucked in favor of the small guys. I would be glad to tell NScers to fuck off if say there would be a pretty big nerf again to supers and turtling right now, something that would *actually* shake NS in a good way. But this isn't the case. You can't return an ironic "adapt or die" if the thing you're suppose to adapt to is stupidly hard / painful.
---
Also plenty of NS / big blob members / leaders are vehement about NS having fucked up mechanics and petitioning CCP in regards to that. You will find most CSM members part of blob entry clearly answering to CCP asking if the economy is fucked up by "yes it is", despite the fact they benefit the most from the current economic situation.
---
Yup, my best guess is 0.5 moons and major indy hubs + Opportune expensive targets out there.
---
But even if we went for everything we could probably do a region a week. Chuck a 5-man leshak group with some logi on each structure and its fucked for the most part, Then just have backup on standby for stuff that does get contested.
---
Go roam Fade and Deklein and let us all know what you think afterwards.
---
Makes sense you are in Iron Armada then, lmao
---
What is the role of the Activity tracker? Are there some rewards that you can get by completing it or is it just a useless achievement system?
---
So a smaller Corp seizes the opportunity.. grab some sov.. and.. eventually.. places a structure.. that then gets drifter bashed..
---
most nullblocs these days are very easy to get into. you should get an alt in some low tier corp in the alliance whose space you're using, scan shit down, when you find something trade worthy trade the bm to your alt and have him trade to the locals. a lot of effort tho, because you can only trade bookmarks while docked afaik.
---
So why all the salty tears?
---
I'm not sure you understand very clearly how weapon mechanics work to make such a stupid suggestion.
---
I can't wait until Triglavians start reffing highsec structures.
---
The salt should be glorious.
---
&gt; but the idea of shifting more power to the one side with incoming damage would definitely add to the combat of EVE
---
Because it isn't already the case ?
---
what pve activities? drifters dont drop shit
---
It's not them, most of them are not playing any more. It's  the rest of us lowsec/small gang/wh idiots that still haven't quit the game.
---
To be clear all null entities in 2019 suck donkey balls, including PL. It's  just that they haven't done anything noteworthy to bitch about lately.
---
Honestly asking... since Drifters aren't hitting EVERY nullsec system, and considering how much salt is pouring from the most densly populated NS areas; has anyone attempted to crossreference the systems being hit with the ammount of citadels in each of them?
---
I mean, if we go with the theory that this is a step towards fighting structures spam (which seems to be the most accepted one at this point), there is probably a treshold below which Drifters won't attack.
---
Yeap if you are not aligned to an alliance it might look like a scam , I would not buy it an di used to do 10/10 all the time
---
\*You do not recognize the bodies in the water.\*
---
KK Thanks! Excellent plan!
---
Have you played the game in nullsec?
---
What's you use? T3?
---
well even PL are defending... NC. dont have shit left
---
Not at home right now but I can sent the cut version later
---
Yeap t3 tengu , just have to pay attention to transversals.
---
5% infill 2 walls, print is about 700mm long also a ton of supports
---
Not a clue ... But if you fancy playing a game of Whack-A-Mole in Delve, I'm selling tickets ;)
---
It'll likely happen the day a better game that the majority of us can agree to move to comes along. 
---
Many don't stick around for the gameplay, They stick around for the community and friends they play with, Give somewhere for all of them to move together, And it'll eventually happen.
---
Luv ya gobbins, but this announcement was pretty cringe.
---
If they say they're in "tapi", they're probably not.
---
man, i would be all over that, scooping like crazy
---
HE meant like "defensive power" of the ship.
---
Are we talking EVE or real world physics here?
---
Looks like a lot of ships exploding.
---
Also, how does it handle the height? Even after tightening all three axis mine wobbles and causes a ton of ringing and ghosting. It's not even fast, it's effectively useless above 50mm/s
---
Proud fo´sho. Why goons havent done shit about it in said years i wonder.
---
Oh for fucks sake. Here we go with the "Eve is the most complicated...blah blah blah"
---
I've played 4x games with as much depth. There's nothing fucking so complex about this fucking game.
---
tapi autists please ignore
---
&gt;only "invasion" systems so you can avoid them
---
So then, basically the same thing
---
Seems to handle it well. It doesn't wobble at all, at least.
---
Eve, obviously
---
You are making a ton of assumptions while dismissing me. How are you so sure CCP doesn't take this seriously? I think they do. It's at such a point [there are now options in the UI to report bots in seconds](https://i.imgur.com/nAVLlRT.png). If this isn't an issue, can you explain why they would put that in the UI? 
---
At the same time, your question on how I am so sure is fair. I think you need to go see for yourself really. But here's some quick answers: 
---
* This isn't one or two, this particular system had 10 VNI in it, in space, ratting simultaneously. 
---
* Most of Fade region now has 5-10 VNIs in each system. 
---
* All are in Gemini Whale United alliance.
---
* All are between 11-21 day old characters, currently.
---
* Their character names are all of the same cloth. 
---
* All characters will land on a citadel at the same time, accounting for warp distance. 
---
* Those who don't are scrammed by rats. 
---
   * Sometimes they log off, other times they do nothing but sit in space driving in a straight line. Depends how good the programming is.
---
   * If you're lucky these are the ones you'll catch.
---
&gt; PIRAT members behave IRL as they do ingane, never leave the comfort of their home/station, so there is no danger of ever meeting one.
---
Woe betide the paperboy who passes within Molotov cocktail range of their bedroom window though...
---
Ahh, that's a good amount bigger than I thought it was. Mine was like 170mm I think. That's fairly large lol
---
You can tell these stupid fucks anything. They're trapped in their own little bubble and think that this is some super complex game that only geniuses can play and that if life were like Ender's Game they would be some awesome fleet commander. 
---
The mental sickness expressed by a number of these people is fucking of the charts
---
Who said I'm crying?
---
It's just a big annoyance...we have to constantly battle these NPCs for no reason instead of battling other players. We're in Null for a reason.
---
It is kind of funny, and gives perspective even with the "Suck it up buttercup" mentality
---
It may indeed require many more changes than just this one to make blobbing up not the optimal strategy.
---
I thought the proposed change would at least be a step in the right direction. Seems that /r/eve disagrees though.
---
yeaha... good Nullsec see a changed name of the system and can avoid them. Oh wait...
---
Revived to ask a q. 959 DPS cold on a HAM legion?! How?
---
If your response to structure spam is to spawn NPC fleets that supposedly have more firepower than the most powerful coalition in the game, chances are you’re going to further the blue donut, which goes against what everybody in NS wants

\+1 for the killboard link. Gemini Whale is a bot-only alliance. How it is still around is beyond me.

I would say it's higher.

They don't and it won't. They're trying to make some point and boycott doing anything with them as much as possible then go "Look, CCP is killing PvP with their dumb ideas".

Edit: Dwiftews, not wiftews, heh.
---
Hi,
---
dewe seems to be a widespwead misundewstanding amongst some peopwe on what dwiftews do and dont. wet's wook at what dey actuawwy don't do.
---
Citadew spam:. 
---
Dwiftews awe not knocking out citadews. dey wef it but don't kiww citadews. Befowe dwiftews, most of nuwwsec, which is Impewium, wegacy, GoTG, Fiwe and associated awwies, awweady had a stwuctuwe NIP in pwace. dey togedew make up de vast majowity of de biggest nuww empiwes. dey wewe in confwict wif Panfam and Fwatewnity, who make up awound 1/4d ow 1/5d of de nuww in tewms of pwayew base and awguabwy even wess in tewms of watting and mining income. 
---
So, even if Dwiftews wef de biggew side stwuctuwes, de smawwew side wacked de numbews to knock de stwuctuwe out.  Meanwhiwe, de ofew side did have de capacity to knock out smawwew side stwuctuwes, which dey did in wast few weeks when dey bashed de smawwew sides entiwe wegions. de defendews weawisticawwy had no way to defend ofew dan iwwationawwy feeding de attackews, so dey didn't bofew.
---
Why 1 side is so big and 1 awe at cowe  pwayews-based decisions. 
---
In concwusion, dwiftews wouwd make biggew empiwes biggew and smawwew empiwes wouwd be huwt even mowe. Hence, dwiftews in no way impact de biggew guys wewativewy whiwe smawwew guys get wekt even mowe. 
---
Howevew, de mechanic actuawwy is so bad it fowced entiwe nuww to come to ceasefiwe. dey don't mind bwowing up each ofew, but dey do mind NPCs intewwupting dat pwocess. So now, de confwict is even wess vewsus befowe dwiftews.
---
Some wouwd awgue dat impewium was done anyway, yesh INIT sota weaks give dat away, but dewe was anofew confwict going on too, wegacy/fiwe vs Fwat. 
---
Dwiftews don't fowwow up on attacks and given de above, we now know as fact dat dwiftews have witewawwy no meaningfuw impact on Citadew spam.
---
Hence, no impact on demands of pwayews fwom aww types of wegions: nuww, wo, high and awso wh btw.
---
Botting:   
---
Dwiftews awen't hitting de awweged majow botting wed zones in any meaningfuw way. I.e. Bwanch, Dekwein, Tenaw, Mawpais, Omist, Fey, Pewwigan Fawws, Dwonewands etc. Vewy vewy vewy few bots might have died, just go dwough de zkiww. It's mostwy active fweet kiwws. dewe awe no wepowts of any impact of Dwiftews on stwuctuwes eidew. 
---
So, against Dwiftews, it's actuawwy safew to be a bot today den actuaw pwayew. An opposite affect of what pwayews awe standing fwom aww wegions.
---
wentews:. 
---
Botting and wenting kind of go hand in hand, see above.
---
Again, contwawy to popuwaw bewief, dwiftews have no meaningfuw impact on dis.
---
So in ovewaww concwusion and contwawy to beweif amongst cewtain yet impowtant subsegment of pwayew base, dwiftews awen't impacting some of de most cancewous ewements of de nuww today.
---
Some say adapt ow die? Nuww has awweady adapted wifin 24 houws, no stwuctuwes wiww go down, dey'ww dwow chump change fweets at de dwiftews and manage it. Howevew, ovewaww, dwiftews awe just a fowced mechanic which is quite cancewous in de way it is annoying. dey actuawwy sewve no puwpose ofew dan being just punitive at hooman pwayews. 
---
wattews wiww spwead out mowe acwoss de wegion, Dumbos watting and mining in staging (which nuwws don't advocate anyway) wiww stiww die and nobody wiww cawe. dey wiww weawn and spwead out watting and mining mowe evenwy. Making de wegion ADMs even mowe stabwe and sov waw even mowe cancewous fow attackews.
---
de consequence of adapt and die is dat nuww has banded togedew and found a new avenue of outwet fow deiw fiwepowew, de high sec. Highsec pwayews said adapt ow die, a mond fwom now, it'ww be nuww pwayews asking high sec pwayews to adapt ow die, de pwobwem fow highsec is, adaption has onwy one couwse: Be affiwiated wif a nuww empiwe.
---
dis wiww be de consequence of not vewy weww fought out game mechanic. 
---
In my opinion: If dwiftews buwn down citadews acwoss nuww and not just whewe yuw have de most hooman pwayews, attack mowe bottews and wentews acwoss nuww, yuw wiww find mowe suppowt amongst nuww pwayews as weww. 
---
But today, and de mechanic as is, it impacts hooman pwayews, not bottews, not wattews, doesnt impact citadew spam.
---
So, no, dwiftews awe doing jackshit to addwess any majow pwobwem, dey awe infact infwating de pwobwem dat awweady exists. uwu

Given that a lot of High Sec Structures are run by null players, it should be. 
---
Goons are probably compiling a list of all their members structures in high sec not to hit. I say bring on the fucking Trigs
---
The server load alone makes it impractical. The same thing goes for friendly fire - shooting out of the average 'blob' without hitting a friendly would be nigh impossible, but asking ccp to run all the calculations is a server-destroying idea.
---
Taking so much sodium so early can be dangerous for your health, be sure to check with your doctor if this happens often.
---
And it's just as shitty as the project nova ai. You'd think CCP learned with the abyssal sites.
---
What in the world is The Meta Show? Please tell me they don't take themselves seriously.
---
"Inners only!"
---
I've been pretty vocally pro-Drifters in this, largely because I agree that this is probably a temp world event (and I enjoy trolling the empire builders). That said, in fairness it's time for CCP to shit or get off the pot. 
---
The fact that the raids are just repeatedly hitting the same systems, don't impact the spam structures, and don't inconvenience botting (but do inconvenience actual PVP) is lame. The fact that they're not even following up on the timers is worse. Either go all in and start taking sov/following up on timers, or fuck off. This chicken shit halfway stuff is disappointing.
---
I couldn't even begin to speculate on that - that's my entire point. Anyone who answers that question for you is full of shit, unless they work for CCP.
---
3.5 years... yeah. nothing could have possibly changed in that amount of time..
---
can you tell me what's appealing about them specifically, without shitting on the other bog standard null entities?
---
It’s too late to save him
---
It's almost like you can dish it out but cant take it?  Geez, it is unlikely this will last very long as its a lore world event.  Just suck it up and deal with it like every fucking thing else in Eve.
---
&gt;  Low security dwellers continued to misspell their names and have trouble determining how to get out of a wet paper bag. 
---
My fucking sides, omg
---
This is too good
---
500bn
---
people prefer to ride CCPs dick than to get their facts straight, this drifter invasion is nothing more than a little inconvenience, but everyone prefers to think that they actually do a lot more... 
---
people are clinging to the last shreds of hope for this game even if they are completely made up...
---
Let's say my group of artillery does x alpha on a perfect hit. If I fire at a single ship that is anchored up some of my guns might miss the ship my FC called primary, but might inflict damage on one of the other ships that are close to the one that was the intented target. Giant blob of ships = big target.
---
&gt;aimless
---
like a lot of things CCP does...
---
it's far worse, we built a bespoke database with search and ops planner that works out the best time to hit the target, to save on war fees :D
---
I'd support Drifters running around high sec ganking mission runners and freighters.
---
purely 0.5 and above.  Low sec is spooky.
---
It’s been pass than a week.
---
can l have a few lines of Spod ?
---
1. I like them better when they move around
---
2. All structures and they hit structures coming out of timers in the constellation they are in at the time
---
3. Yes please
---
4. They'll be farmed to death if they drop anything substantial. CCP has learned their lesson on this one
---
Never give up on your dreams
---
For sure, but I don't know if they are visible on Dscan, if not, they should be.  
---
Though if they drop things worth something, it'll devalue those things, that being said I really wouldn't mind if they dropped Antipharmakons.
---
??? Are you trying to say we went home to Delve because of the " equal or greater firepower " we encountered in Tribute? ... That's a new spin.
---
He does, "he" is not CCP though...
---
I'm just making observations on reported information 
---
Don't kill the messenger
---
atm only goons cry all over reddit about bad NPCs.....before they were proud of killing so many NPCs and dominate them, see the irony?! :P
---
Buying a supercapital of any type also gives you access to the VIP hangar.

someone knows his code :P
---
Tell me, if you put 2 balls of titan at 0 of each other rather than 150km away, does it changes a whole lot to you ? Gameplay wise I mean ? Sure it will look like some Star Wars battle but gameplay wise it's exactly the same, since you just get many ships firing into one ships. No cool ship movement, it's titan under Tidi.
---
There is a reason titan balls get far away from each other. There is a massive advantage in ability to disengage, to manage dread bombs. An advantage that will never be worth splitting your ball of titans for.
---
Secondly, if you want could dynamics fight, don't look at fights that happen every 6 months but subcap fights. There are regulary fights happening with several fleet splitting off damage, kitting and  orbitting each others that looks super cool to watch. You can't ask titan fights to be like that.
---
"Content" means something to do. How is killing the same idiot that keeps attacking me every few days content? Because it's something to do. Doesn't mean it's something magnificent, fully thought-out, or super rewarding.
---
I'm not saying it's a good system, I'm saying "they don't need to explain anything to you".
---
Or you could just play the game and stop whining for this or that....
---
Boom. Thanks!
---
Lovely, thanks!
---
I'm fine with PvP ganks. I've lived my EVE life in Null...I'm just not a fan of "they just keep attacking, with no real purpose". It's something to do, but I'm not enjoying doing it.
---
Why defend at all? Not like they will follow up, eh?
---
Yeah, well that requires a complete rework of damage mechanics and most likely the whole engine to work. Not even tkaing into consideration the fact it will massively increase the workload on the server.
---
Way to double down on being a retard, top marks.
---
Roger..used to fly a Tengu 5 years ago. Nostly HAMgus. Them arbitrarily nerfing the damn things after I put time, ISK and effort into training and designing not only those but also other toys I enjoyed and had put large investments of time effort and "money into that they arbitrarily fucked with is what led me to quit back then.
---
I hear they are recruiting.. they will only consider players with a 100% KB with at least 150,000 kills... So the bar is even lower than most 'elite' Eve player corps...
---
I'm not so sure about content. For me I see the same people who used to take out random fleets to PvP take out random fleets to PvE. 
---
It's the same people doing roughly the same amount of fleets but now it's against NPCs instead of other players and in a lot cheaper ships.
---
Look, the Ikit takes over three minutes to ramp up to full DPS. You didn't stay on anything nearly that long with it. Most of your kills were in just a volley or two, or you were able to kite someone, and for doing either of those things, you'd be better off picking nearly any other ship.
---
I made a lot of money back then and it was fun. I even did it after the balance of t3 and it worked. I think I was doing them in like30 min - 45 mins

For those that don't know, this is an anti-cloaking technique that most people don't see until it's too late. Most players don't have corpses on their overview, and if you're within 2000m of a corpse, you can't cloak. So either direction to the gate, everyone will decloak.
---
I'm totally new to owning structures and have some questions:
---
If I anchor an astra and set up the ACLs then transfer the structure to my holding corp, do the ACLs stay or do they have to be set back up by the new "owner"?
---
Do ship skills play any role in operating a cit? 
---
For example, does my gunner need to have capacitor skills trained high for the astra to have more cap? Do shield skills increase my astra's shield tank?
---
If I'm deploying my astra in a low class wh, do i really need a point, a web, and a target painter in the mids with only one ecm or should i replace one of the above for another ecm?
---
There are 22 HS regions, with some being notably smaller than others.  For example The Bleak Lands has a tiny amount of 0.5+ systems.  Most campaigns are 4 weeks, with many spilling into neighbouring regions where targets were limited.  Rough maths - we visited each region at least twice over that time.  We noticed changes were actually fairly limited (save things going from full power to low power).  It appears in HS at least, industrialists tend not to change their structure set up, unless attacked.  Once they are up, and in use - they tend to stay up until someone demolishes it.

Let me guess, he didn't expect his triple rep myrm with neuts and mwd to be *that* cap hungry, and ran out of cap and died?

One thing I never managed to complete was The Maze...either from having to run do to "interruptions" or getting lost even with the "maps" available.

I was assuming orbit and periodically jettison. Like driving down the highway tossing out your chicken bones as you go.
---
Actually i do NCPL whining as they are owned in PVP, goons getting bested at PVE. Eve 2019
---
Perhaps, but it should be far less server-destroying than friendly fire would be. I mean, in a simple implementation where you keep track of all the instances of damage and their directions and you do advanced calculations on every new hit of damage, that might cause too much server load (it might also not, if that is not the current bottleneck of the server). But it doesn't have to be super precise. A simple implementation where each ship just keeps track of the damage it's received in the last X seconds coming from each of the 8 octants, that would be sufficient already, and better approximations are certainly possible.
---
They look pleated at least.
---
BUT ITS THE END OF NULLSEC AS WE KNOW IT
---
Ditto. Moved to Nul. Way easier.
---
I have no idea, Just logged in to check on my PI and saw this.
---
That did escalate quickly
---
Slightly more aggressive? Dude... They're shitloads more aggressive and can fuck you up well and good if you fuck about when they are around. They lock fast, web and scram the fuck out of you and do insanely high damage. 
---
Are they easy to avoid? Sure. But there's no rats that even approach the level of damage these things put out.
---
Thank you for the advice I shall go to the doctor straight away.
---
We don't need help getting enthusiastic about bullying sissy-va, in fact this thirst for our attention feels a bit dirty...maybe if you just stayed on grid when TRC boys came knocking, things would be different.
---
and the cycle begins a new.
---
Yes, please do it
---
Yep this been asked and will be asked 100s of times a month. Remembering that you will spend 10-20 hours a month just getting your omega time with and will need to farm even more for ship to have fun in, sounds like a job to me.
---
Join a big null sec group like horde. Do a fuck ton of moon mining. Do not sell to the buy back, ask some one to refine the ore. Buy a bunch of blue prints to run ore though. This way you only pay for the refiner and maximise your isk.
---
When there is no moon do pi or even stop farming and have fun in the game for a bit.
---
I expected you, as a wormholer to know that those stay in wormholes.
---
You disagree with my comments and choose the awesome counter argument of "learn2play". Its not my problem if you are unable to perform the actions you want, the game gives you and other players the tools.
---
You'll not need to kill a bot in a system with Drifters, the drifters would likely kill the bot for you.Setup logoff traps in the systems that have active bots instead of dead drifter systems.
---
i can fully understand that and as said above, i too think this is a shit mechanic. but still. they are out for what? 3days!?
---
we dont know why theyre here, we dont know what they do we dont really know ANYTHING. how about we give it more time until we actually know before sperging out? or raging when we actually know what this is all about and know how this could turn out in the long run.
---
sperging out without even knowing what is happening is just rediculous.
---
&gt; loot that is actually worth something
---
Anything in Eve that's worth something will, unless the supply is severely restricted (1008 looking at you) will eventually become worthless due to over-farming.  This is a law of physics.
---
I don't think they should drop anything interesting tbh.  Otherwise I like the cut of you jib young fellow-me-lad.
---
What if the drifters could determine who is friend with whom and take actions accordingly.
---
They would keep track of who is on grid and who fires at who.
---
If alliance 1 never fires alliance 2 = friends
---
If this situation occurs often then the drifters would angage them. But I guess we would have an amazon river of tears from everyone. People can let go of each others dicks and stand up on it’s on:(
---
I've been thinking ccp were going on about how much the ais have evolved I'm wondering if a player group were to start attacking the drifter target maybe the enemy of my enemy is my friend would kick in?
---
Why not make the skin owned by the Alliance leader or otherwise add an Alliance role for skins that the skins belong to?
---
And... Fuck goons I guess?
---
Ah ok. Guess their hoping to just create timers for players to form for...they should rethink what structures to reinf though - who owns them (can people realistically fight them in hostile space), what they’re used for and in general they need to step it up A LOT.
---
I have just two questions:
---
1) Who is your dealer?
---
2) Can i have some?
---
even if  it afk bashing if i was line member or fc i straight get bored/burnt. man i was getting burnt attacking structure in hs,ls, and null.
---
The [killmail](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77573683/) says yes.
---
Because obviously your ability to login is tied to the alliance you are a member of.
---
penif, very chill dude ... i was sceptic, but since meeting him regularly on TS I really like these elitists ... maybe they backstabbed INGAME, at least they did not make public RL fun of a seriously ill dude telling him to suicide. That is what is really revealing a human shithole
---
Pretty sure you are, you're just four letters and a number after all.
---
The only people complaining about drifters are nullsec retards.
---
i said that? im sure you can show me a quote from that right?

I think one of my rolling mega’s that got stuck was one of those... bulshit infinity scram....

You can drag them to cargo from the people and places tab and then jettison them.
---
Dominixs and Ishtars everywhere!!!
---
Dont try too many. Being a known corp hopper will make it hard for you to get in a decent group.
---
just take my upvote for this one.
---
Buddy, the concept of nuking high sec is so fundamentally retarded alone, not even mentioning the reasons to try it.
---
All you're gonna do is give an assload of isk to high sec in your buyouts and not be able to kill anyone because its high sec.
---
High sec has lived without extensive player owned structure usage before, they don't need the citadels.
---
Myrmidons
---
Indeed
---
It isnt really doing that though, the drifters were a shock when they first appeared in null but it's not a problem anymore. Even the fleets last night were "align ansiplex, ignore the asshole at front door we got people on it" it's like CCP released mosquitoes, if you never saw them before you go wtf but then it's just an annoyance. Let me know when they start waiting on rf timers.
---
Goon leaves delve to try to solo, get fucked.
---
myrms.
---
THEY DO IT AS WELL!
---
the point of this argument is that people keep crying about others botting while their alliance/coalition has had a hand in that too.
---
there is literally no null-sec entity that is member of winter co, goons, gotg, legacy, xix, panfam that has the right to cry about botting since all of them support it one way or another
---
He’s probably that dumb motherfucker in fleet who drops tank/dps/tracking modules for more Sebo’s to get on more kills while also splitting dps to “sOlO pVp” tackle rather than kill the primary, then complains in alliance that he didn’t get SRPed if he dies.
---
It is not interesting to me, but I respect the diacpipline it takes to gather and maintain this data.
---
I guess it is also not interesting for CCP to see how much they underestimated the proliferation of this cancerous kind of structures and their mechanics.
---
Make citadel skins a rig type item. Destroyed on unanchor.
---
Sell from either next store, or from lp
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but "No you!" is the statement you're looking for.
---
They could drop blue loot though, and because that is sold directly to NPCs the value wouldn’t change
---
More like should rebrand Fraternity, Just Bots Please Ignore
---
legitimately sounds cool
---
You're for reducing the blue donut but you're in GSF, the largest entity in EVE. So here is my challenge to you, and everyone else in GSF who claims to want to end the donut. Leave. Take your mid to large size corporations, and leave. Go to lowsec, go to other parts of nullsec, take risks, carve out your own name. I've bene playing this game for over 12 years and I can tell you the best wars are NOT TIDI infested blob fights, but rather the 100-200 man brawls where everyone matters more. Take the leap and forge your own name onto something instead of being faceless bee #4567891234.
---
A little trick other then the ones all ready posted is when you get two pings pick the further one it is usually the right one
---
You: Expecting uncontested structure.
---
Also You: Suprise Pikachu face when we show up.
---
The moment your small dicks are in high sec they'll drop Drifter capitals on Delve and take the region from you before you can even burn back to gate to turn around. :)
---
A nice guy with a nice fit ;D
---
&gt; If you have a huge scan strength you can sometimes do better than that, and I know at some point in the pass I heard rumors that with a high scan strength and a single RSS probe you could use the numbers to identify the type of signature (but I'm not sure if that was true or still works)
---
That was true a veeeeeeeeeery long time ago, but I'm 90% sure it was phased out during one of the (several) scanning reworks.
---
For shits and giggles I tackled a ratting Gila in a dp Fed comet yesterday, his passive regen overcame my OH DPS and his drones nearly two shot me. Obvious outcome but scary all the same.
---
Eve is the best place to harvest tears
---
Line of sight damage.  Theres a 100,000 word essay about cpu usage and everyone doing lances on grid.  Then another 100,000 word essay about damaging/deflecting off gang/alliance/positive standing pilots.
---
This has to be a manifestation of  the null-sec block's "plan to ruin everyone else's game" strategy.    
---
This is  part of how they plan to disrupt hi-sec trade/economy.
---
Also, look at this corp "Zero to High"..   I am familiar with most corps flying into our area of space and suddenly yesterday my gang saw this bunch roaming around 20+ and we're all like who the heck are these guys.    Start checking characters in corp and all are 4-5 days in corp.    All checked have positive sec status.     
---
Give the corp name a bit of thought and you might think - hmm is this null bloc alts moving into a npsi-style
---
"ruin everyone's game" high-sec/low-sec invasion corp???
---
Yah.... basically none of those people are still playing the game.
---
Source: Was one of those people. Now I play Albion.
---
EVE University is a corp that helps newbies to get into the game and they have alot of learning material and in depth information about nearly everything
---
I have the feeling that you did not understand what I was hinting at.
---
Yeah completely forgot about the gila!! In before Gila’s bpcs go up like crazy
---
You must have experienced our low sec operations team.  I do not visit the Kubinen pocket as I have not had my jabs.
---
Cognitohazard confirmed. Team Unicorn inbound.
---
I've said this for a long time and I get downvotes every time.  Possibly because I'm an asshole but also possibly because people want CCP to succeed.  Anyway, CCP has the Midas touch but they turn stuff into shit instead of gold.  They've had so many good ideas and so many things where we've been like YES EVE NEEDS THIS!  Then they talk about it and tease it forever before it either never materializes OR comes out so half-assed and watered down that it may as well have never existed.  They've blatantly lied to us(it was technologically impossible to get ship spinning back)...yet here it is!  Captains Quarters had some epic teasers about 7 years before it came out...as a Captains Closet, and "totally not"a test bed for another game which never materialized anyway...though to be fair the stories about how idiotic CCP management was in the development are more entertaining than that game would have been anyway.  Oh, and DUST.  Everybody except CCP new it was coming to a dead console and that it wouldn't be long lived.  
---
They are too full of themselves to ever succeed.  They are one hit wonders who got lucky and they're going to slowly ride EvE into the ground while paying themselves to pretend they have a clue.
---
Ah, that's my bittervet moment over....on with my day!
---
They're doing a really bad job
---
I guess, ingroducing this shit event is better, than doing absolutely nothing about sov stagnation and shitadels, which CCP are successfully doing for 3+ years now.
---
Could it be a Cyno-Saurus field?
---
&gt;Wrecking crew?
---
i prefered Ice Climer but neither compare to Exite Bike.
---
I always like it when the guy who loses the fight calls the winner a "pussy."  It seems to be both common in Eve and contrary to the vulgar, yet well-understood meaning of that term.
---
It's early days but in the north over the last 2 days I have seen a shit load Ishtars, Gilas and 2 or 3 domis.
---
&gt;Despite what the bee man is reeing about.
---
Do you guys get your rocks off on saying anything anti-goon? Stoll have yet to hear any complaints. My entire discord has been praising this event actually. 
---
&gt;Thank you for finally creating a mechanic that will help to limit the size of space empires.
---
Yeah it's not really doing anything of the sort. It's just another incursion, but with doomsdays.
---
But we do know from empirical evidence how the drifters dont work.
---
ahh i see... a WH puppy that didnt get a kill because intel are bad hmkay.  
---
Its fine. You will get yourt VNI kill sonner or later :-)
---
I logged on to far too many items to sell before work
---
Lol, PA owns CCP, eve online or not, and voluntarily nuking a project is the best way to get some serious budget cuts and lay off lots of people. Not happening.
---
I've actually been in a fleet that was sent to a system in delve to shoot drifters.
---
"some bullshit to do with warping is why you can't target this npc" was a message i got on my screen, almost every time i tried to target something.
---
i'm probably way more tolerable to PVE than most people, but it was just fucking retarded, if you want to force me to do pve - fine, just let me do it when i turn up to endure your bullshit.
---
oh right yeah, and when they warp of you can't probe them to warp to them, and they go stupidly fast, and like to sit at 100km+ from you if they don't warp off.
---
even trying to participate is cancer, before we even get to the fact that everything else about it is cancer.
---
Well my bet is on tomorrow update.
---
If too farmable it will shit on the value of isk
---
T5s in hawks is good money
---
You are guessing that ccp seeds plex but when given actual data to explain why people who plex actually spend more than a normal sub you disregard that. So this is feels not reals?
---
I think is going to be deployed tomorrow!!
---
God i love this game.
---
To clarify a bit - it was always a misconception.  Because one gets their skills over time, many people who hadn't played the game thought new players will never be able to catch up with the old players character-wise. And it is true if one never purchases chracaters (which was a very common practice, made via the official forums and with the developers assistance in the form of rules and website UI allowing for that) or uses skill-injectors (newer mechanic, largely replacing the character trading).
---
However, personal skills and knowledge of the player had always been much more important than the character's. People look down on new players who just wallet their way into good characters, but have no idea how to play. No one looks down on a player who are good at what they are doing, rregardless of how many characters of theirs were bought or not. Especially if they were bought with the ingame money that the player managed to accumulate on their own, by just playing the game, without a credit-card debt.
---
In short, any player who takes their time to learn the game and improve - will catch up within a year or so. Although it may be more complicated to learn how to do so than in most other games.
---
They are not so powerfull. You can solo them easily with citadel..
---
Wasn't Brisc's thing also due two another guy buying a bunch of Harbingers? I think I remember that
---
because one of them is exclusively pve content, and doesn't even have the good grace to be rewarding.
---
Yes I have spent quite a while precisely mapping out where they have attacked, maybe this data might help https://i.imgur.com/yQtAlc9.png
---
That ship has sailed. Structure up, been rolling, been exploring, been ratting
---
60 mins... interesting.
---
The referral gives 750k so so I'd go for that, check if you can get the same offer from ccp. On the other hand the 500 plex = 1 month, and the multiple que training token can be sold for isk or be used to train a second on your account. Both are good choices.
---
Big salt spotted!
---
Cap missiles need heavy webbing support tho.
---
I discharged a patient yesterday with low sodium, I should have directed him to download eve
---
He isn't wrong, unfortunately as was predicted by sane people, the event that was unceremoniously added to the game with no context, hyped into ludicrous levels by people here on reddit due to how vague everything was, turned out to be nothing what people dreamed up on the rumor threads that people started to create and comment on about this event.
---
One has to wonder if it was worth it for CCP and the game to have a few days of over hype nonsense being spread on this forums about a mechanic that clearly had no real goal other than maybe cause major null blocks to do more defense fleets at their home regions.
---
However if there is one thing that we  can take constructively from this event and hopefully CCP will notice, is that the vocal player base appears to be reaching a desperation level never seen in the history of this game, where people actually begging CCP to introduce PVE mechanics to solve the problems that the players themselves can't, or won't.
---
They don't show up for timers because currently the only thing you can fight them with is:
---
1. Supers or Aux force backed capitals
---
2. Destroyers with as much alpha as possible pulling high sec gank tactics.
---
This is not a normal fight, if you try and do anything that is not a multi thousand hp ship it dies instantly.  At 200+ km.  With no tracking issues at all.
---
Your dreams are really memes.  They need to drop shit.  This is npc stuff here.  Bpcs, salvage, whatever.  Anything.  Make it worth the time to go shoot them
---
yeah no
---
If CCP could figure out all that they could just ban the botters instead.
---
ITS THE END!!  PACK IT UP AND HEAD BACK TO HIGH SEC BOYS
---
You are a special kind of idiot.
---
challenge accepted
---
this!
---
could do it with some t1 destroyers and ammo trucks
---
I'd bet it has to do with ammount of structures in the system, but tbh I don't have the data or the will to actually check it.
---
&gt;Edgy
---
Hmm
---
&gt;Just offerings to the drifters to continue mining salt in null.
---
Ironic.
---
Could you enhance that data for me? Like really CSI the shit out of it.
---
I really fucking love data collection and design far beyond your average guy, but why is this of all things looked down on in EVE? Intelligence is extremely valuable to each faction.
---
No you overestimate it you fucking tool
---
wow can I unvote for him please
---
1) learn how to computer code and script
---
2) get a job working for CCP 
---
3) fix the problem
---
4) then complain about how fucked it is now
---
there is a level of certainty needed to ban someone, and the level of certainty needed to send drifters after someone is lower than what is needed to ban.
---
It has about triple the number of active modules that a Goon can be expected to manage.
---
It’s not so much that the knowledge in Eve is very deep, it’s just very wide. 
---
In other words, there isn’t a lot to learn about a few specific things, it’s just a little bit to learn about a lot. I’m relatively new, and I had no problem keeping up.
---
Yes, they are all worthless trash in game and IRL.
---
Damn, I probably have more hours clocked in Escape Velocity, than EVE. 
---
Polaris waifu, the best waifu.
---
Your video editing is atrocious. I can't remember I watched a video this bad.  The resolution is bad, the sound bit rate is worse. Also, halving the speed on anything from eve is shit. Slomo adds no bonus to eve fights. They are already slow.
---
You can't evict an entity that has the same PvP numbers in the same TZ either.
---
They’ve been  apart of the database for some time now. I think they never introduced them due to balance.
---
I made a post a while back about them all
---
Yes we shall. PM me when the whole of hi sec is burning, there are no more citadels there and the entire hi sec player base has quit.
---
I'll wait.
---
Can bots light cynos?
---
Lots and lots of fun around 03-!
---
I agree with this dude.  
---
 
---
 It's been great content warping around in a system with 50 dudes for 90 minutes to clear out zero isk/zero reward rats. I especially like how you clear the system and then within 5 minutes there is a new 10 man drifter gate camp insta-locking and insta-blapping anything sub-capital. 
---
#This is obviously a move by CCP to make every single player only roam or use capitals. I approve.
---
I imagine that some tweaking can fix that.
---
No one enjoys forced gameplay. Just ask anyone who's been war decced or ganked. Sorry, but I have zero sympathy for you or anyone in null at the moment.
---
You wont get kicked, someone else will just sell it at 10% markup instead or something
---
cringe post
---
Most of them. Karmafleet is a good one, as is brave if you want a huge Corp style of play
---
\^\^ Tis the truth ... F1 is the only key I can use
---
nearly everyone who plays this game is here to inflict suffering either directly or indirectly. there is always a loser in eve. no one says that burn jita is an attempt to make new players quit.
---
If you put aryth and not about actions in the same sentence, i got bad news for you.
---
Maybe, but only on a small timescale
---
Ive seen a lot for ishtars and Gilas around. Botters are still using VNIs but have seen a couple transfer to Gilas.
---
I never said it doesn't
---
I could definitely be wrong but I think the numbers came out that even without TP/Web cap missiles actually applied slightly more dps to everything down to and including frigs. Obviously you’d want support to be *effective* but it was ridiculously bad
---
So you want null security space to have the same security as high security space?
---
Hopefully something better this Wednesday.
---
For now what we see, for the last 2 weeks is something new retarded, worst than the previous one. Iniciation of P2w &gt; pointless drifter PvE crap &gt; some plex sale.
---
Im actually impressed with your critique. It seems you know your shit.
---
good bot
---
Not sure really. But it was NDA breach, not market fuckery.
---
I remember one time during the Alliance Tournament Gobbins tried to leverage his position as one of the winningest AT players of all time for extra time between matches.  CCP then informed him that he could have the extra time that he required, but it would be considered a disqualification. 
---
I'll never stop loving Il Gobbino
---
100% agree
---
/u/Jibrish I beg you to ban this bot
---
The only thing more retarded that drifter 'content' and Delve krabbing is highsec bashing by bigger blocks, that luckily has less and less participants.
---
someone who is 4 days into the game is not going to have a reason to hate NS groups and wont be familiar with NS politics that turn people away from living in NS
---
I understand, but it appears people are planning ahead of the changes.
---
It's the next Invasion thing. Wednesdays downtime gonna be 90 mins, etc.  
---
The next step to stop null from having PvP fun (but on the upside, they don't have to defend vs Drifters either)
---
I see your point but. Do you think if rules / patches / limits were put on the larger groups, they would find ways around them and still be the same size/power? For example, an alliance can only have 5 titans total. Wouldn't the large alliances just make largeallianceA, largeallianceB, etc etc with 5 titans each?
---
Your goonie tears taste delicious. If you ever make it to hs, lemme know.
---
I love when people fail to think through all the results of their idea, and post it anyway.
---
Hint: What happens when someone wants to invade?  "Hey, I'll go over the citadel cap and now the Drifters defend my space for me.  No more enemy staging citadel!"
---
You press f1 on a super? Perhaps you have no idea what you are sperging about.
---
I guess some of you bind the boson button to F2, behind the cloak.
---
Just fwiw, if you could put the actual skill plan into a pastebin so it isn't aids for mobile to scroll that be awesome.
---

---
Well lets invest on Isharts prices are going to go up like crazy
---
Doubt it, they usually do this balance changes along other "significant" stuff and not on their own.
---
60 minutes downtime on Wednesday..
---
so let me get this right; you think that NS invading HS wont lead to better player retention because of bullshit politics, but it took you 5 months to get bitter about NS? you got retained long before you made the at lest somewhat informed decision to stay out of null. /u/Lucius_V 's argument that notoriety via invasion could be a good thing still stands. you didnt do anything to damage the argument.
---
Where are you looking for them? They show up certain times of the day, during those times they're swarming the place
---
you are meant to come back with a cheeky low ball offer.  then we haggle
---
Holy shit that's an aids VNI. Probably went down in three shots.
---
There's this new thing going on (maybe you didn't read anything about it, but it has something to do with both Triglavians and Drifters shitting all over the place), so maybe the extended downtime has to do with it.
---
Never not go fuckgoons
---
Yes, because a several year long fucking up of Eve mechanics sounds like a great idea that is totally worth it.
---
No, probably not. Maybe half
---
And this is why the ~~B~~Ree stays to the big blue donut where they don't ever have to face the *horror* of, dare I say it?
---
Losing a ship.
---
Well that server data was available to all, maybe you could have written such a tool yourself? I know that also other groups had logserver based tools reading out watchlist logins or cynos. Basically NEAR2 and TACO are the same setup upon the server log data still available. 
---
ALL other points shown as example pics in the imgur link are standard functions of intel tools (reading out zkill on pilots giving out most used ship fittings or the likes, or local scans combined with local channel scans that are parsed through zkill, giving you list of all in system that you can filter by Corp/Alliance/Ship/special interest points like "Titan", "Supercarrier" or "Cyno")
---
Oh yeah looks like CCP is modifying that too! Still ill put my money on the next update
---
Long live the ferox scourge!!!
---
They might do the action, but it's not about the action, it's about the narrative behind it. It gives their line member F1 monkeys something to focus on.
---
Maybe most of us think that YOU are a pain that we can't stop from respawning.
---
Bottom line is fighting HS and getting tears would be more interesting than fighting the north is what this tells me
---
Dad why are you typing to me ingame? You are sitting right next to me.

To be fair, doctors fight cancer with drugs that kill the patient too. Just saying

Removed:

 shipBonusDroneTracking: False-&gt;None
---
Added:
---
shipBonusDroneTracking: None-&gt;False
---
I don’t write code but does this mean the removal of the bonus?
---
IE “None” is an indication of a level “0” to be adjusted by skill training?
---
Just making sure I’m understanding these changes correctly.
---
You don't need a blinged battleship. You can go with a 300 mill malestrom or and 250 mil hyperion and go with Warp to me
---
No. Make supercaps support only. Done.
---
&gt;  If drifters burn down citadels across null and not just where you have  the most human players, attack more botters and renters across null, you  will find more support amongst null players as well. 
---
In other words: "I will support it as long as it doesn't hit me"

It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine

They do drop stuff, just nothing substantial
---
They overlooked that - next round will just be the authentication servers so the citadel gunners can’t log in to defend.

Shit I think I still have 3 VNI hulls that haven't exploded yet. Maybe this will cause a change to FW?

You can call them minimal nerfs all you desire. Again practical experience is overlooked. I have yet to get a reply from someone who has pvp experience post nerf with fighters. Plenty on downvotes for asking for actual post nerf experience.

Praise James!

You underestimate the power of true smugging

Not anymore since We Un-skilled ourselves

Thats how you pvp right? Plz advise

Drifters bash the structure, and the next day it repairs itself like a good shield timer cause there is no follow up.
---
The french translation is awesome :')
---
Drone bandwidth noooooooo! Good thing I’ve already got my carrier ;D
---
On another note... when TF are they gonna fix battleships? I miss my rattle.. but it’s more expensive, dose less DPS.. Targets Slower.. ect. ect.
---
What are you talking about.
---
The Astero is low SP so it gets taken first so you can scan with it Asap. The Helios is an ugly slow POS used by amateurs who don’t actually stalk with their cov-ops. The cheetah is better for stalking and making warp in pings due to its much faster cloaked speed.
---
You completely skip over interceptors which are clutch. 
---
The Impel is only good for its cap charge tank. But it’s mass is too big for small class wormholes. I prefer the mastodon since you don’t actually need the skills to fly your cap truck in your PVP capitals. And you can always toss in an impel.
---
And having a carrier on all your alts to roll with seems a bit excessive and like a waste of SP. you only need a charon &amp; carrier on one alt.
---
Subbed. 👍
---
I wouldn't wonder if ccp wouldstep in by such actions.

The big super capitals are really expensive (100b, ish) for a titan + implants. Then you only get to undock it to actually fight with it, about once a year maybe. It’s cool to own, but not practical at all
---
I hope the mods permaban this scrub.
---
They aren't cowards. There is a risk to being with them that makes the game somewhat more engaging.
---
This is meant to have a platform to train more specialized characters from. I already have a 120milsp dedicated subcap main. 
---
The point is to be able to bring more backup ships. &amp; ships with characters that aren’t necessarily in the hole, but could use a swinging dick from time to time. &amp; so you don’t always have to log in that specific account. 
---
Also to bring many many armor leshaks. As they’re hot AF.
---
Haha.  This makes my shitty morning a bit better!
---
People without structures would just get wtfbbqpwnedwithnosauce360noscoped by the folks that have the infrastructure to have structures, especially the larger groups with big toys.
---
What is pvp?
---
too bad you're wrong lol
---
Can you specify more on the risk of being with them? From my vantage point, they are the third largest power bloc in nullsec behind The Imperium and Legacy Coalition, and they've forced a stalemate with Legacy.
---
Dont listen to that guy, if you need exploration training without the alone in local tidbit you can pm me here.
---
You should call the real bad guys. The ones from the WH's. If you make it, they're like a cancer eating the goons from the inside.
---
He probably lives in Jita
---
Well here in delve, the system I live in sees drifters every day. So idk how “random” they are supposed to be. But supposedly they will keep bashing all structures in system until stopped (which we have). But if they keep returning, will they take armor and structure?
---
Seeing as they have killed jump bridges in low power and taken low power cits to final timer. We assume they will kill structures if not defended and they happen to “Randomly” attack during the vulnerable period.
---
I totally agree with this.  I would add that exploration in high-sec isn't very profitable.  Practice scanning and hacking in HS then start making your way to null for the much high value loot.
---
The added benefit here is the experience of safely navigating dangerous areas.  Those skills are priceless.
---
Spanish one is seriously fucked up, I'm still laughing.
---
&gt;Now, morons want to attack high school.
---
&gt;What kind of joke?
---
&gt;I will not go to high school.
---
&gt; this is purely a time waste inflicted by the company on null members for  playing the game along the mechanics they themselves implemented. 
---
And now there is a new mechanic to play around. But as allways "it is only fun if it doesn't affect me negativly"
---
Yeah that s fine
---
Send me also Money! I'm also a goon direcot with Keepstar Access! Will transfer it for low connections!
---

---
Oï !
---
I checked a bit around my own knowledge and some PYFA toying, and came up with those answers =)
---
Concerning your first question, I'm not 100% sure, but I'd say the ACL reset. And even if it don't, the new structure owners can still change it to their preferences.
---
Ship skills don't help with citadels, IIRC. The only way to improve a citadel's HP is by using the Standup Layered Armor Plating, that only improve the armor HP of the structure. However, there's one skill that seems to work both on ships and structures : (Advanced) Target Management, which allow you to keep more locked ships on your structure. Please do note that there are skills in the Structure Management section of your Character Sheet that directly improve the effectiveness of a citadel's gunner : Structure Electronic, Engineering and Missile Systems, and Doomsday Operation.
---
If you're willing to put up a medium-sized structure in a wormhole, where everything you put inside can be looted by an attacking force, you should be able to tinker your own fits =)
---
So majestic.
---
It's purpose is in its name. It tracks your activity in a large panel of in game professions, like mining or industry.
---
You don't really get anything out of having the level V in everything on your Activity Tracker, but eh, if you're the first one to have it, maybe CCP will erect a structure in your honor like Katie Sae ?
---
no, 
---
Praise Artemis Tyrannos!

I failed hard :(

Day status: made.

This is why I love this game, this shit right here...I’ve always told people that being an asshole is somehow prerequisite to being a capsuleer.  I mean, if you can’t beat them...call them a pussy, right?

Nahh, you just said it in your own way

tbf, anyone not in the same side as goons is in some sort of risk. the only thing allowing other nullsec blocs living the "empire building life" is goons' boredom

Spent several years doing industry in null, as a GSF member. 
---
As someone that was there, doing it first hand, what you wrote is a bunch of bullshit.  Most of the shit came from highsec.  Transported down and reprocessed in null.  Not even goons is self sufficient, and is dependent upon high sec manufacturing and mineral production.  
---
All this NS can bring HS industry to a halt is bullshit posturing for people that don’t know better.  
---
Without HS industry NS would fucking collapse.  No more cheap ammo, no more cheap minerals, no more cheap items to reprocess, no more JF industry, no more cheap ships, no more anything.  
---
If it was all coming from null, wtf was I having billions in minerals imported in order to build anything.
---
Fuck man. The common goon line members has the self confidence of a 15 year old who’s too afraid to leave his moms basement.
---
My morale, if ever low, was raised by this post.
---
Dude no one cares. The pvpers been bitching for years how broken shit was in null and non of the null players cared because it benefited them. hS, LS,WH game play been broken for years and again, no one cared to fix it because everything was in null. You’re going to have an extremely hard time finding someone who gives a fuck outside of null. Hence the crazy upvotes and joyful screams about the NPC invasion
---
Would it be cheaper to buy a minokawa fax alt or inject my alt with ~6m in drones and support skills to a minokawa?
---
I don't know what else you want me to say, what is the point of your insistence?
---
Yeah, I'm just waiting to hear from karma at this point i guess?
---
I'm assuming you haven't taken a look at the moongoo prices yet - have fun buying t2!
---
More likely as someone else mentioned the botter dont have their stuff posting to skill so hundreds could be dieing a day without any record we can see showing.

Kind of like how SkillU made a shitton of isk protecting botters in the Holy Rental Empire.
---
The time of ratting VNIs will be over.
---
But will VNI find new use in small pvp?  
---
It loses drone bandwidth, some agility anda bit of speed. But it the drone tracking bonus is increased from 5% to 10%, a new 7.5% armor rep bonus is added (if I am reading the raw data right), +50 PG, +40 CPU, +1 turret hardpoint and -15 signature radius.
---
Go for it
---
This will only harm the less fortunate like me, it has very little (if any) impact on a largest alliance that mines and rats all day in the most secure corner of space.
---
For 16 to 24 hours a time!
---
I see nothing out of the ordinary.
---
I don’t disagree.  I would add make it more like an incursion than a constant unenjoyable mechanic.  
---
Give a warning, have an idea of progress and an end point.  Have clear consequences for not clearing the NPCs.  
---
Have the guys drop interesting stuff, or give some useful reward.  Actually make it ‘fun’ and not punitive.  
---
So many people want CCP to make some anti Goon hand of god event to wipe null clean.  I would humbly suggest making entertaining game play that people might actually enjoy, even if it adds some work, would be better.
---
*My vision is not about that, as usual minds not expanded by spod cannot  see that the end is cumming.*
---
any type of market warfare you want to inflict on us is moot... our market is better stocked than jita and we make 90% of everything on it in house. We are self sufficient.   Even if you knew how to raise the prices of PLEX it doesnt hurt us it hurts the rest of the eve buyers we can afford to buy them, So you are only helping the sellers.... wait... is this a clever ruse for you to sell more plex

Period Basis is a notorious botting region. Bot or not, glad to see someone in their alliance destroyed.

That fit doesn't look that bad on cap, double cap booster should let him run his tank til he runs out of booster charges. He was still going to lose to that loki but there is no reason it should have happened with 17 charges in cargo.
---
Just checking the `/universe/structures/` endpoint on ESI there's 3662 freeport structures right now.
---
Dear god this is some level of shit posting....
---
ok
---
&gt; You also know now why NCPL whine so much.
---
Actually I see reddit full of goon posts whining that nobody will welp shiny stuff into their meatgrinder. 
---
And some reasonable posts explaining that in current meta this wars will never happen again because of exponential growth of someone already exponentially ahead (mainly because of capital mining that CCP made multibox-scaleable so Goons would not whine so much anymore about multibox-afk-able sentry Carriers taken away ... the gaara syndrome ya know)
---
Let's hope they give drifters capital ships and the ability to follow up on timers but still bluebell on some.
---
Dont forget rens bro!
---
Everyone does. Including test. However the only ones pretending to have nothing to do with botting and enjoy blaming their current enemies while pretending to be clean are the usual test  dinobrains who need that lie for their personal narrative or whatever. 
---
As long as ccp does not punish alliances for profiting of botting nothing will change.
---
nobody cares?
---
literally the entire state of r/eve disagrees - people care, that's why every 2nd thread is about this.
---
So no July patch notes or did I miss something?
---
Drifters keep reinforcing the Tranquility cluster.

Yeah like in a real invasion, surely the Soldiers would chill at gate and just hit Bob Ross' cabins instead of major structures.

---
So is this still happening?
---
Little does he know there is a plex market in goonspace that he cant touch. Raising jitas price would only ensure that goons buy from Delve and not from jita. Thanks for helping :)
---
Still a tiny percentage of the players.
---
“Oh dont worry the third rep is basically for emergencies I’m just gonna pulse it hahah”
---
I too was also like that long ago.
---
No evidence yet... but the rumour’s been repeated by independent data miners for three days now. The sheer continuity of the thing makes it worth investigating, if only a bit.
---
Provi-Bloc used reddit! 
---
It hurt itself in its confusion!
---
This reminds me of the 9-4 Spy\^h\^hCYNOU-sural Field... too soon? ;)
---
It isn't that about nothing happening.
---
It is that it is the same song and dance as last time. 
---
A futile waste of time.
---
If drifters ignore damage caps they could easily ignore concord.
---
If I shoot you with 2 guns 1 time, will the 2nd shot do less damage?
---
It strikes me that the biggest impact of the embargo will be to teach macroeconomics to high sec.
---
Managing a game where all the players are cut throat scammers is interesting imo.
---
Well, *something* will happen.
---
The other market hubs will get busier for a while as the market adapts to your... “idea”.
---
You must have been doing this before citadels, rorquals, and the goons moving to Delve. The amount of moongoo, PI, and minerals coming from null has exponentially increased. Pretty much all new Titans, Supers, subcaps, etc built in Delve use locally sourced materials, with the exception of some T2 salvage that are region specific.
---
Want me to touch your market? ;)
---
You know... they say there are no dumb questions... but DAMN
---
Why would you ever breed a killboard warrior with an f1 monkey?
---
... because they don't have regulars that they trust?
---
When someone they know says, "It is yet another burn Jita guys. https://zkillboard.com/system/30000142/ "
---
They are going to deny what they are seeing on a kill board and believe Mr Random Zombie Bee that all is fine?

Yeah well that's a lot for a newbie

Don't be a coward. Bring a real combat ship.

Destroyers are really good for the pirate epic arcs. I have done them with Thrasher.
---
ofc it is....
---
My thoughts exactly. The Mittani mentioned it during a fireside chat and I was both intrigued and a little nervous about them.
---
However, as I may be a follower.. a blind one I am not.
---
So here I am on my journey to discover more about them.
---
Someone before linked a change log above and I was hoping that would have some answers. But I didn’t get any. There was a file change noted that I cannot read.
---
Who’s to say they haven’t been in game for awhile now and just needs a switch to active?
---
But I am no coder nor will I pretend to be able to read it. So here I am seeing evidence and explications.
---
Hey im a renter there. I've actually saves a couple rorqs that asked for help and cynoed my dread in. I might have lost one too but its all part of the fun.
---
How do you know?
---
I've been war decced and ganked lol that's part of the game. Those are totally different situations. With War Dec we know who it is and what they're going to do. Most of the time we have enough spais in the world to know before big things happen. With the Drifters they just pop in out of nowhere (they don't jump from nearby systems all the time), with no warning at all, and start shooting.
---
It's similar to ganking, except that with Ganking I can see in Local what's happening. I watch Local to see what's in the system, and nearby systems (alts), so it's damn-near impossible to fully "gank" me without some level of warning. With the Drifters, they literally pop in 50k away and start doing big damage. If you're not in a capital there's very little chance you're going to be able to do much to the 1000dps a piece they can put out. Try running? They'll follow you.
---
It *is* very different from war dec and ganking, and it's less fun.
---
Why do we want NPCs to bash structures?
---
You should definitely do that.
---
I'm sure it will be every bit as effective as every other time someone has gone, "Grrr, highsec should just (something that requires coordination among highsec players)!"
---
First of all, your idea is stupid by far more reasons than I feel like writing down.
---
That being said, the "Nullsec embargo" will fail due to their own greed; members of the big alliances trying to enforece this will be the ones smuggling null-exclusive minerals to HS just to benefit from their increased prices... and even if the price of t2 commodities increases because of that, I bet it won't be that hard since a lot of people will be doing it and there are already huge stockpiles sitting in HS waiting to be sold (lots are being made as we speak). 
---
In fact, I'm willing to bet that some of the people pushing this embargo are the ones already planning how to smuggle minerals to HS and make a massive profit.
---
In fact, this will probably lead to the rebirth of an extinct profesion EVE, which is awesome.
---
1) WTF happened and 2 WTF do they form perfect spheres?
---
Mr Ratter5000 in his Raven, doing the same L4 missions as he has done for months and years, suddenly loses one every day or week, just so that he can go and buy one in Jita during a Burn HS event?
---
Mrs Miner9000 is going to suddenly lose both their BPO and all their barges to rats that they can easily tank in order to go shopping in Jita during Burn HS?
---
No, the vast majority of HS will be in their home systems laughing at the few idiots that go shopping in 1/4 trade hubs when they are being camped.
---
Say..if the drifter's kill something, is it blue loot: free to grab?
---
Joining KarmaFleet can take upwards of 14 days. Has anyone talked to you about fastracking your application?

and we would haven't gotten away with it too if it weren't for you pesky kids
---
I mean, I spent my first 6 in EVE as a pirate, and I killed the shit out of carebears and noobs. I was never an asshole, and was always willing to give advise, etc.; however, I was perfectly aware that my behavior probably was resulting in some subsection of my 'victims' quitting the game. By this logic then (or what's underneath it in the context of this thread), I always 'wanted' the people I killed to quit EVE.
---
Not only that, but CCP, in making a game where it was possible for me to behave this way, and thousands of others as well, ***knew*** one of the likely consequences of their game was that some portion of people would quit as a result of emergent gameplay. This goes for any potential 'burning of high sec' as a result of the Drifter invasion as well.

**THEREFORE, CCP, Pearl Abyss, and the leadership of these companies responsible for these game mechanics** ***want*** **new players to quit EVE.**

Well no shit, learn something new every day. I was under the impression that they stopped letting places pick and choose what codes went where, ours is definitely the 2017.
---
&gt; (lots {of stockpiles} are being made as we speak).
---
&gt; In fact, I'm willing to bet that some of the people pushing this embargo
---
they are the ones selling to the people creating stockpiles.

That doesn't make it less annoying.  We burned like 2b in Corms yesterday fighting 15 fleets of drifters.  The way the drifters move around and warp out if you jump on them was quite cool...if they didn't just one shot everything on the field it would be a lot more fun.  Instead we're forced to fight in cheap ships by the hundreds just continuously dieing.
---
The majority would have kept your comment alive if that were true.
---
&gt;Create a shake-up that undermines large empires but keeps game alive  
---
&gt;What would you choose? And if your answer is:
---
Problems:
---
1. PVE is arguably the weakest part of the game;
---
2. This 'event' has no storyline, nor any 'rewards' worth mentioning;
---
3. It was introduced with no notice;
---
4. Doing this PVE content is *required;*
---
5. Since it is required, this PVE content forces players to stop engaging in content they want to engage in;
---
6. It appears to be aimed specifically at null sec alliances;
---
7. This makes ***all*** of the null sec groups feel like they are specifically being picked on;
---
8.
---
Dumbass.
---
&gt;Why don’t we just raise the price of PLEX 
---
please do, it's where i've been dumping all my liquid lately.
---
... and the process of extraction was enjoyed by both.
---
you can lead a horse to water...
---
Most people will probably use Jump Freighter, but your image is far more poetic, have an upvote.
---
Yeah.  This.
---
One shotting all opposition isn't fun.  I'd actually like this mechanic if it left bunches of vulnerable structures all over that players could come in and wipe out.  If you don't defend everything gets ref'd.  But if you do defend you can win with reasonable numbers and reasonable ship comps.
---
Not:
---
Oh shit 15 fleets of drifters in our staging better burn 2b in corms. Like yesterday.
---
Now for extra points use Alteryx or Tableaux for data visualization.
---
&gt;What is there to enjoy? You can;t fight these things with anything less than overwhelming numbers.
---
Goon posting has truly reached it's peak, complaining they have to do something they regularly do.
---
why would people smuggle bulky minerals when you can add value to them and make them easier to ship by just producing things with them?
---
I want to sit on my sofa in captains quarter again  :(
---
Big corp taken out by a covert spyno-sural field
---
Dude, they are not the only ones producing, I know people in HS indy corps that have shit tons of T2 ships and modules to sale, and some are still using the massive stockpiles of materials they acquired before the moon changes.
---
So yes, they are clearly playing the market, but they don't have that much control over it as they want you to think.
---
For this to work they would need to keep this "embargo" for months if not years, while at the same time burning everything that moves. That's just not gonna happen.
---
I love the E-Uni fleets when we go to Tama or somewhere, take down someone blingy with a bunch of Merlins, and he starts filling local with profanity about how we're a bunch of noobs or something. Happens at least once every time we have do such a fleet, with some alliances being reliable sources of this sort of response.
---
If we were really as worthless and pathetic as those people claim, I would go into local and let everyone in Tama know that I lost to us.
---
&gt; meone that was there, doing it first hand, what you wro
---
I have many things I could say here: first it has been a real long time since moving minerals in the form of items to be reprocessed has been a thing. Like years. 
---
Second, if you think its bullshit just take a look at the economic reports CCP releases every quarter. Do that and get back to me. For example, Delve produce more minerals than the rest of the universe combined, or it did at one point. 
---
And nearly *all* of the tech 2 moon goo comes from alliance moons in null sec. 
---
Given that, you can say I am full of shit all day long; however, maybe log in to your Jita alt right now and check the prices on Tech 2 materials. Do that, and I will remind you that the half assessed high sec embargo--up until now anyway--is slightly more than a day old.
---
they aren't exactly difficult to kill as it is, if you drop a few dreads on them - they die. 
---
pretty sure we lost at least one titan to some one throwing dreads at it on the way back to delve this week. pretty sure it was some guy's erebus. i'm also fairly sure we lost a nyx in the same fashion.
---
not to mention, a short while ago we had a nerf to remote reps to make it easier to kill things.
---
If you want to break eve down into it's simplest form, you have a ship, can double click to move, ctrl+click to target, and click on modules to activate.  You can warp between points, jump through gates, and dock at stations/structures.  
---
The learning curve is more about the sheer number of different modules, factions, missions, structures, npc's, ships (each with different amounts of fitting space and slot layouts), types of pve, playstyles, and areas of space.  Add to that the human elements of interacting with players, the market, and organizations, and it's a huge amount of information.
---
Ok, "minerals or t2 production". Happy?
---
goon detected lmao
---
&gt; They are more of a random annoyance than a threat ***atm.***
---
I hope threads like this encourage them to send the Drifters back for timers.
---
42
---
you're not going to smuggle t2 products out of delve - the entire point is to export that shit and crush the margins in high sec by using cheap inputs from delve along with the superior bonuses you get for producing in null.
---
It's been done in the past.
---
/I was a Polaris agent many, many years ago.
---
You may want to include a link to the website somewhere in the post.
---
Goons stopped exporting ore to jita /s
---
create dozens of alpha accounts and keep then in the freezer for a year or two before injecting into a titan, got it
---
VNI has always been a PVP beast for people willing to use them that way.
---
Good one! Always forget that :)
---
Not a chance, im really going into this blind
---
Like you stated issue is in injectors. As long as you can insta inject into current most usable thing - thee is no possibility of any balance
---
You get a taste of what it's like to be in someone elses playground, like every high-seccer who visits Null without an invitation.
---
This is pretty awesome.
---
If you manipulate the market so you can sell at +60 you'll get a vacation tho
---
Make injectors better for new players and worse for higher SP players? Not sure what the solution is here, but I doubt CCP will remove thier cash cow, or new players ability to close a 16 year gap
---
Please raise the price of PLEX so i can then sell my stockpile at stupidly inflated prices and buy all the AT ships i've ever wanted.
---
As an alpha no less
---
Hey, maybe carrier application is too high and haws were a mistake
---
Bosons would be fine if the titan actually couldn't recieve reps for the DD cooldown duration
---

this is already the case.

freddy fresh face gets 500k per injector, i get 150k.
---
frat seems to be fun but norraus gives off a "prick" vibe
---
If I had a magic shield bubble around me, it could reorient itself to become stronger in the direction it has just been hit.
---
&gt;Goons are delusional. We have the power to shut them down right now if everyone who hates their smuggposting started to fuck with them.
---
The irony
---
In StarCraft 2 I had a guy tell me I suck after he lost to me. Some things are gloriously universal.
---
First
---
Drifters blowing up citadels means that you actually consent to PvE by leaving NPC-station. After that you or your assets are no longer safe.
---
Nope.   T2 products aren't under embargo.   We'll export them to you ... but at our prices which will be lower prices than HS/LS manufacturers can match.
---
I've played a decent amount of SC2. Only thing I've ever said when losing was GG.
---
If you want to join KarmaFleet, join the in-game channel "Public Karma", read the motd, and fill out an application using the website.

i spotted the problem price of minerals and compressed example 6.19 trita prica in lazyt and iph 7.24 but is use data source eve marketer and min sell nothing change
---
Second
---
Yeah but that's not what you said before
---
PL 2019 comeback tour. I hear Grath is going to be the hedliner at the main event :D
---
Yeah but the high sec producers will just go mine their own minerals.  That makes them *free*.  Checkmate, goontards!
---
This is going to be fun
---
... Why not fire it *backwards* then?
---
 "@ everyone big old enoncment, im quitting EvE this isnt something i have been thinking about for a hour but a fair few months, I have alot to do IRL and can't play this game giving 50% im always 100% &amp; that's what gets me angry &amp; dedicated. Youll are welcome to join P3AK / others. Ill hold up  the corp for a week or two then close. Discord will always remain for some banter and catchups but for me its over comrades. I apologise for the boy's that are otw back &amp; wish everyone the best luck. "
---
\^\^ The above is from Paldave of Dopamine. Looks like the move to FRT was death.
---
You'd probably also get the boot for just selling +60 for no reason tbh
---
I think the funniest thing would be if tyrants blapped a new bro and then sent him isk for his ship
---
Just remember, no one from KarmaFleet will ask you for isk or any other BS for joining. There is no fast tracking of applications. If someone does this they are trying to scam you (which is prohibited in KF).
---
This hasn't affected sov stagnation and shitadels mate. That's what I've been saying, it really doesn't do anything about them.
---
they want them to have the sig the size of a planet with the hp of a frigate so their pick gang of condor country condors can kill a 100bil isk ship with only 2000 dps in their entire fleet.
---
no you wont lol
---
We are on the same page. I was trying to be sarcastic.

Wait, what? Does that mean we will lose Aura?!
---
Every village needs a grumpy old man.
---
I suicided my sniper vni last night. Was the most agile ship for the job of deploying 5 sentry drones. Domi lock-on is too slow. Ishtar will be too expensive. Myrm lacks the bandwidth. I'm sad.
---
Maybe we should slide into his DMs and offer sanctuary? 🤔
---
I actually replied to you why the current tools and meta don't work at all on what you're suggesting. 
---
You made a statement and it appears anyone who has basics of null mechanics down wouldn't make such statement.
---
So, I didn't make a no u statement. However, you do have actively avoided the question on how much do you know about null mechanics.
---
Then you smuggle high volume minerals... are you retarded?
---
Sometimes it takes a few days to get in but it's worth it. Remember to give Toni with milk and cookies.
---
We demand corpses.
---
Not at all, I'm fine if they hit me, but why not also bots and low power citadels and renters and botters? Why the discrimination against active human players? 
---
Let's make it more equitable, tell me, why should CCp give even more advantage to botters and renters?
---
RIP sarcasim
---
Thank you! Such a nice and heartwarming welcome!
---
Really? That's your idea of an embargo? That sounds fucking awesome to be honest, can't wait to buy cheaper stuff from you guys.
---
It would be an easy way to grieve someone by selling stuff to their buy-order in a citadel you own and don't allow anyone else to dock. They'd have to asset safety everything and wait 5 days if they have another citadel in the system, or 20 days otherwise.
---
So let me get this right:   HS will deploy miners in unprecedented numbers to make up the trillions of minerals NS is denying them?
---
What could possibly be the response to that?
---
&gt; Lots of people in hi sec never venture into low or null because they feel the only way to thrive there is to join a massive corp where they will loose their identity.
---
DUnno what you're smoking.  You can go into Null easy.  You act like there are gate camps and hot drops in every system.  Most systems are pretty empty, and gate camps aren't insta-death if you know their mechanics; nor are bubbles.
---
TL:DR LRN2PLY
---
You *might* want to bring your sarcasm detector in for a tuneup, mate.
---
Psh you're actually p cool when you're sloshed :D
---
You have Delve, Period Basis, Fountain, and Querious.
---
Maybe you arent seeing bots die to drifters because bots are more a narrative than an actual issue.

Love that you guys have fleets like that. I might be moving into that area in the near future after I close up shop in my wormhole.  Hopefully I run into you.  I'll be sure to shit up local properly when I die to a bunch of noobs in T1 frigs. o7
---
I mostly fly t3, so far the ruination is having your market alts raise prices? Oh, the inhumanity! How will eve survive such an event. Maybe you should ask mittens to stop playing warframe and actually lead you lemmings?
---
i've been seeing you and your cardboard sign on the corner for some time now, glad to see you found a roof
---
Well you need like 35 mil sp for almost perfect dps titan. Bit more if you want to do fleet boosts.        
---
Super is like 25 mil sp.        
---
Rorqual 14mil last time i heard.

Those are pretty low SP numbers

Nope. If you can't be bothered to download more power from the internet, I am not gonna tell you how. Just leave one shield extender offline and tell us which system you are in. We will make sure that that system is reinforced with more players so you can online the module once in space. 
---
Trust me.

&gt; they aren't exactly difficult to kill as it is, if you drop a few dreads on them - they die. 
---
fc what are faxes
---
you're truly on a roll lately dave jesus christ
---
I think theres a skill under shield that reduces the power grid needs for shield extender..shield emissions or something.
---
**How to make titans more vulnerable:** Put some fucking effort into scouting titan targets and drop 15 dreads on it. 
---
God this new generation of EVE players don't wanna do fuck all to accomplish something.

I like to long walks under a freeway overpass and listening to the wind whistle down alleyways, call me.

3 rep can be good on myrm but not on vni. He loses resist (so buffer) and also too much of the rig. Well i dont like this fit. The loki probably have neut too.
---
Well Grath does use one side of his hand for caressing, but the other side. Well the other side he uses for correcting. Both are enjoyable
---
Id read that book while i poop
---
&gt; pretty sure we lost at least one titan to some one throwing dreads at it on the way back to delve this week. pretty sure it was some guy's erebus. i'm also fairly sure we lost a nyx in the same fashion not long after.
---
That’s honestly a pretty poor counterpoint. I think the standard of “can die when isolated and alone” is a really low bar to balance against.
---
If you’re into that sort of thing, I guess.

Swap one of the T2 shields for a Meta. Then finish training the rest of your shield and fitting stuff to 4 at least.
---
This.
---
If you’re not first you’re last
---
^ sensible, since you don't need to stockpile mountains of ammo. A handful of crystals will last you a long while in your little wormhole.
---
Some alliances in provi. Also I think PIE which is Amman faction warfare flies exclusively Amarr ships.
---
thats daily commute for some people, 4hrs
---
Gee whiz! That was fun. Good playing!
---
Shield upgrades
---
My PI needed doing before I went to my college class. And this was the most glorious thing I saw
---
You will be supplying everyone with cheap T2 stuff for a while, sooner or later this "embargo" will fall, and then all T2 producers in other area of the game will dump all the stuff they have stockpiled (because they already have the materials needed to build it, or will get ir through smugglers/alts-in-null) for however long this lasts, bringing even more cheap t2 stuff into the market.
---
This, as someone like me who does mostly PVP in LS is a clear win-win scenario.
---
HS/LS/WH industrialists will just focus in other areas of production and/or stockpile for later and just wait out the storm; it might affect some people a little, but most of them are already putting things in order to do exactly what I described.
---
If anyone, this will affect the newer players trying to get into T2 production and that's about it.
---
If you also decide to glass HS it will of course affect more people, but I'm actually cool with that part. Oh, do remember that most low tax structures in the busy parts of HS are owned by your allies.
---
Ok, how did I do? Was it worth your wait?
---
He didn’t choose the low sec life. It chose him
---
Something that should be put down
---
I've seen some in systems without XL structures.
---
I've seen some in systems that do not normally have a high population.
---
ccp = drifters
---
&gt;Like you stated issue is in injectors.
---
It would be much less of a problem if the ship you inject into isn’t so powerful. Strong ships don’t care how you got the SP and injecting doesn’t make weak ships any stronger than normally trained ones. 
---
Even if injection never happened, we’d still have come up against balance issues anyway.
---
The best way to try this game is to change your mindset from being risk averse, join a newbro friendly corp, and dive right in without looking back. Spend as little time in high-sec as you can. Every newbro corp will accept you as an alpha, and from day one you'll be getting content. They also provide mountains of help through skillbooks, free ships, advice, etc.
---
The best piece of advice anyone can give you is don't try to play this game as a solo player (unless you're into solo pvp).
---
and don't forget to **ring that bell**
---
If so the lower threshold of number of (standup) structures is 4. Maybe a couple more but still in the single digits.
---
&gt;It appears in HS at least, industrialists tend not to change their structure set up, unless attacked. Once they are up, and in use - they tend to stay up until someone demolishes it.
---
Would you expect anything else? If the structure serves as an inveestment for an activity, why would that isk be tossed aside without reason just to set up a new one elsewhere?
---
It'd be like docking up your shiny incursion ship and spending isk to buy a new one, exactly the same, never using the previous one again.
---
But it’s not a slip knot
---
What were the 5 structures in the system that was hit? Maybe it also takes the size into consideration?
---
Drifters should scan for 24x7 VNIs and then later Domis, create bubbles.
---
Thanks for the info! I'll see what I can do.
---
CCP Shite-as
---
Or use meta 4 RLMLs, you (OP) won't lose that much and have way more fitting room. And let's be honest here, that's a ratting fit, so you'll barely use those launchers.

Mmm, if you wouldn't mind hooking a brotha up with the cut version it would be most appreciated. Tried getting an STL of thos bad boi into a safely printable form a while back but couldn't really get it right.

Wtf is "losing a ship"

Wtf IS that?

Does that mean you like can't find it? Shit I've "lost" tons of ships in a few of our many structures.....wtf are you on about?!

Goon btw

imagine being this salty while sucking mittens dick

Everybody else is quitting because of the drifters, might as well.

I can only upvote once sir.  :[
---
Okay so you know when you blow someone else up?
---
Ah, right. Of course you don't. 
---
Ok, so you know how sometimes when you come back from pressing "Start" on your VNI bot there are a bunch of objects in space? Those are called *wrecks*, and they used to be spaceships! Crazy, I know. Well, something your alliance has been hiding from you is that this is actually, a game! That's right, you can have fun!
---
What you do, is you go out there, find some other person, and you blow them up! Of course, sometimes you get blown up instead, but that's part of the game! It's super exciting, you should try it sometime!
---
AM I the only one that wonder what "targetAttack: None -&gt; true" means on the drifter BS and the amarrian imperial escort ?
---
But 3x0=0
---
1. Ships are ammo, not armour. The sooner you are happy to lose ships in order to get better, the sooner you’ll start winning.
---
2. Join a corp. The game is all about what you can do with others
---
3. Once you’ve got some spare money, join the faction militia and join a fleet. Faction Warfare is a great way to get into pvp.
---
4. Learn either logistics or interceptors - easy for a new player to train into and a good role to learn pvp.
---
5. You don’t need millions of skill points to be effective, Always push the limits on what you can do with what you have rather than always thinking that another skill injector will make it all better.
---
6. By all means join an industrial corp if you want to mine or manufacture but it can be dull.
---
7. If things don’t happen with a corp, consider joining RvB in Caldari for never ending pvp.
---
Re-read pls kthxbye. Retard.

---
This isn't the game for you
---
God when even the alliance that was literally founded on Reddit autism is making fun of you, you fucked up.
---
They do as another mentioned. But the solution is to make only core skills n shit injectable. So no injecting titan skills no injecting rorquals or dreads/carriers. Even t2 ships feels sticky. That way the 1% in eve cant just buy more alts. But again we would be hurting ccps cash cow.
---
Speed of training or the ship's overall speed ?
---
Asking because i also went for cheetah on my alts as a sort of unified ship to use and i don't see many out there.
---
I think you’re right and I think CCP is going to have a problem until they address their game and go to sort of clean it up. It’s like on old HDD’s you gotta do a disk defrag occasionally to re organize things. These corps haven’t played for a while or these citadels have been unfurled for so long they should turn into rogue drone hives that drop loot and don’t have timers.
---
TIL that every player in the game is a Goon
---
There's no way it lasted long enough for the cap to run dry tbh. Look at that damage dealt. 
---
That's like, three HAM volleys.
---
Bounty can u convince brax to join snuff
---
"Avatar (Hidden Zenith Amarr Capital) Target attack: None =&gt;true.
---
Could be fun for the drifter invasion event given that the drifters seem to especially dislike the Amarr.
---
I mean I think it would be smarter to just organize up and start refing their structures when they mobilize to highsec? Can't be everywhere at once...
---
Ive flown my titan outside the pos shield more in the last 18 months than in the 6 years before that.  Hate on the cyno jamming and umbrellas all you want, but I finally get to use my end game ships.
---
What exactly do the drifters do?
---
Awesome, thanks for this list!
---
I've been thinking of joining an industrial corp, so I might as well do that.
---
I wouldn't do it tbh either way.
---
In principle, targeting noobs (can flipping was used often) in newbie starter systems was a big no-no even before CCP cracked down on it.
---
In principle, outside of these areas, all goes; but sitting just outside of the starter system (which tend to be dead-ends), seems to me to be violating the spirit of the rule .... which is to protect the newbies.
---
Off-c, in the end it's down to CCP's interpretation.
---
It was a good start but they need to have the drifters target more intelligently - they need to come back for timers that they successfully reinforced, at least some of the time, and it would be good if they targeted ships ratting or mining in anomalies more deliberately than they currently do (as that would work against AFK ISK generation and botting, which are both bad for the game).
---
Right, because you guys find all the pvp content from within your WH? Open your eyes, you constantly try to find content in Null, if NS dies WH dies.

I don't really agree with joining a big newbro corp **unless you are going to be very adamant about finding a mentor(s) yourself ** right away -- which you can do just by talking to people you fight.  No one is going to just pick you up out of thin air and be your mentor.  You're also not going to learn the fundamentals of PvP in a blob corp.  You're going to learn how to be a meatshield.

You need to learn things like engagement profiles of ships, weapon types/ranges, ship pros/cons, typical fittings, how to pilot somewhat well, how to manage your modules in a fight, and so much more that you can learn just as easy by doing your research and getting our there and fighting, and then going over that fight to see what happened and what you could do better.
---
As a noob, go to lowsec and learn to PvP first -- then go join a big corp if you want to be part of alliance warefare.  Join a small corp if you want to be part of something.  They are usually much easier to get help from individuals as they aren't dealing with 100 other newbros.  At least in lowsec you can more easily choose your fights.
---
One good thing about those big corps is the SRP and free ships for newbros.  Which isn't all good because you should be finding your own fits to learn why those modules are being used rather than just having them given to you.
---
Well, for non AFK-ratting still quite good of course, and for PVP it does seem very nice as well. Maybe I'll get around to testing it... if I ever get my main back into PVP at this rate.
---
CCP: mining is the only viable empire building strategy left.
---
Nullsec rejoices
---
CCP: here's a lil PVE event
---
Nullsec: why the fuck do you force PVE on us CCP??? reeeeee
---
Aye, but what about armor ships? Their magic shield bubble is worth about as much as a caldari battleship in a race
---
Wasn't it slated for something like October when the first reports from EVE North emerged?
---
Assuming that Reddit is actually representative of the population of eve
---
Eve is a player driven game, always has been
---
Any reason for this?
---
Do you mean my home system... If I see you around there again I swear to god, I'll call you a pussy in local. 
---
Yeah... How do you like that?
---
Truck yeahhh
---
No, you are overcomplicating things.
---
Some ppl ... prefer to play this game no-strings attached, and NS has strings.
---
There are ppl who simply cap themselves at cruisers, destroyers, frigs, battleships .... whatever they wish, and beyond that point they don't want to progress. They login for a few hs each day (at most 10hs a week) and run their missions, do their exploration, do their industry.
---
For this type of player, NS comes with strings.
---
This type of player exists, is active and pays a subscription every month for his fun, and EVE provides that fun because of the massive ammount of complexity and huge differences in playing styles.
---
#GOD PLEASE NERF THE LESHAK I HATE THIS META ALREADY
---
tbh idk.
---
It's bad myrmidon with drone tracking bonus.
---
There will be some use on lowsec which has lots of ab small ships and medium plex, but I think myrmidon is straight better ship in general. but who know, let's see.
---
Alright, so essentially I should learn the basics, and get used to them by myself, before seeking out training to refine the skills and getting even more used to them, right?
---
Anyway, seems like sound advice, so I'll keep this in mind!
---
See, by assuming that their opting out has to do with 'bitterness' and 'hating nullsec' you are dismissing their playstyle as inconsequential and ill-informed.
---
CCP better not try to release anything until they address that I guess...
---
And you're never without paint/web if you've got half a brain since you can fit those on the structure too.
---
Drifters are here to remind you of that.
---
Haha this guy is always cloaked in a Loki if you know the area you know him and if u get caught then you deserve it
---
👀
---
It is hard for me to hear Aryth say what he says (as well as mittens) and think that they legitimately love the game.
---
Just reading these comments makes it hard to not think that majority of these r/eve posters are pathetic losers.
---
10 isk
---
Hahah :D  what’s your in game name :p
---
Literally do that, it works.
---
please do we have Aryth ;P
---
You complained that avoiding the systems in nullsec is hard because the game doesn't outright tell you where it's happening.
---
That was your thought.
---
You have yet to present an alternative thought.
---
&gt;However, I've also always hated F2P MMOs
---
it's not, it's a subscription game.
---
f2p is bullshit - it's just a trial account that doesn't expire. don't let the PR and marketing department lie to you.
---
You don't get it, opting out of nullsec and that lifestyle is not hating it.
---
Hating is actually playing that lifestyle, and i hated my time doing it.
---
Some ppl are like that, and it's not an insignificant percentage.
---
Guys who obviously had no clue.
---
How we handle this in KF is take them to a private channel and give them meaningful one on one instruction. 
---
There were too many folks just trying to get jabs in and laughing instead of teaching. Get them the information required. Laugh after you have taught, not before/during as it makes it all seem like a joke.
---
My Issue is that Faction Warfare was super fun, and something I may want to repeat again but it doesn't make isk. I had the idea that I would use Industry to make my own ships / mine my own ore so I can reduce costs. That worked for me, because it allowed me to do different things with having an objective in mind.  
---
However it ddin't make isk, which is what I want to rectify now.  I like running missions as far as being relatively calm activity and making some passive isk, but I think ill get back on the FW kick once things get going for me.
---
I'm gay for Garth

Here's my story on how I played Eve for 10 years and made friends with people from all over the world that while we do not play eve anymore, we still talk to each other and play other games.
---
I came out of Star Wars Galaxies frustrated and disappointed after they updated and redesigned the game for the whatever.  I picked up a new issue of PC Gamer that had an article on Eve explaining how some new ships recently came out ( I think they were battleships).  They were extremely rare to own and expensive.  Some leader of an alliance had one and his #2 in command was pissed at him for whatever reason.  He hired a mercenary group to kill his leader.
---
The #2 convinced #1 to bring out his expensive ship while the mercs prepared.  #2 then tackled #1 while the mercs jumped in and killed him.  #2 then steals a bunch of stuff and there's the story.  When I read that, I couldn't believe a mechanic was in game that allowed that.
---
I didn't even sign up for a trial.  I went straight to subscription.  The game has a STEEP learning curve. It may be better now but even then I was sitting in an asteroid belt mining and shooting tiny NPC's wondering why the heck wasn't I gaining XP.  When I asked in the help channel how I was supposed to level up my skills and was told just right click &gt; train. I was blown away. 
---
To this day I will tell anyone I come across that Eve is the best game ever. period. What it does, it does extremely well and I haven't found anything else out there.  I played it for 10 years, met some amazing people I call friends to this day and continue to follow it.  
---
Try it.  Worst case you say you don't like it but keep in mind, it's a steep learning curve.  Don't get frustrated and above all else, prepare to lose your ship and everything you've looted on it.  YOU WILL DIE and you will lose stuff. It's the game. Don't fly what you can't afford to lose.
---
Yeah surprisingly a lot of variety in names in this blob, I recognized 10-20 scrolling through the list in jita that day
---
&gt; But yeah fuck supers in general, just remove them from the game all together I say vOv
---
Preach it, brother
---
I read that book to learn to poop.
---
Oh they taught after we joked for a bit. Also they know  I have thick skin so that’s why they’re really roasting me.
---
I sincerely doubt its going to work how they think its going to work.  Sure they will be uncontested and blow up alot of structures, but its just kinda like "kay?"  and even if they just suicide gank everything they'll either eventually run out of sec standing across characters or people are going to dock up and play another game for a while (like a month).  Their plan is delusional and frankly a giant temper tantrum that they aren't getting their way.  I hope CCP doesn't break on this, I really do, because this is just a ridiculous null sec reaction.
---
Yeah, but that 2013, so far, being tightly packed has created fortresses, and great protection through the supercap umbrella.
---
True, i have no idea what CCPs goal is, but to not try to make ppl spread out is folly.
---
At least you're not doing afk structure grinds and getting cap blobbed in null-sec!
---
He actually logs in, unlike 80% of this subreddit.
---
I am not disagreeing with your comment but I am questioning your spelling.
---
I have always spelled it “kudos”.   I am interested in your linguistic support for “Qudos”, because I saw that and immediately got hungry for some fast casual burritos from Qdoba Mexican Grille.
---

The skill injectors aren't really the problem, they just sped it up.

It was going to get here regardless.

sTaY cLaSSy
---
That FAX pov is sick, nice editing too!
---
Most fights take place on wormholes or in anoms placing less emphasis on pre setup kitey bullshit.
---
Really the null blocks choice on that, instead of using the opportunity to both defend and attack.  But whatever a temper tantrum is good too I guess?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r96z-3MZ6-w
---
Yeah I’ve just realised it’s kudos... my bad! Suppose I’ve made your mind up for what you’re having for food today!
---
Yeah. I've been thinking of moving out to null or WH, but I'd miss those fleets.
---
"X in chat if you have been on three or fewer fleets."
---
X x x x x x x
---
An hour later...
---
"FUCK YOU EUNI NOOBS! FUCK YOU WORTHLESS SHIT FLEET! CANT BEAT ME ON YOU'RE OWN!"
---
"Well, yes. His ship could beat any of us individually. It was worth several times as much as the entire fleet. But please do not respond in local."
---
The more ISK on the kill, the better the salt is. Assault frigates for example, aren't as good for salt as HAC's despite being consistently salty. Maybe I should bring a Venture along to gather the salt.
---
Tama local is especially funny when someone accidentally links the killmail there instead of fleet chat.
---
Honestly, to me it’s the neuts that the leshak has that makes it overpowered.
---
2100 dps, disgusting armor tank, AND cap reduced neuts?
---
I watched this fight and the only thing going through my head was “holy shit that’s a ton of neuts”.
---
The tracking of the leshak is very poor, and there are ways to defeat them, but when leshaks are able to have a giant field of neuts around them, that are bonuses, it’s oppressive.
---
3 medium and 1 heavy neut per 2100 dps battleship? Lel
---
Would be nice to go through life being oblivious tbh sypher was right when he was talking to the agent about getting plugged in again
---
With the salt and effort being put in by null, it doesnt seem like a bad job heh.
---
My first real solo pvp as a newbro was with a 2x Gecko VNI.
---
Then geckos got expensive.
---
I had a lot of fun in/around catch with people who assumed it was ratting fit.
---

---
should recruit him to my elite pvp guild. hope he can art and craft
---
Pretty sure they had those when they were first made, before they got unique models.
---
I guess they zeros them out but left the variables in there
---
Yes we have numbers, but with this wonderful event, you have to get those numbers in ships and however many jumps to target in less than 15 minutes or they reff it anyway.
---
&gt;they should turn into rogue drone hives that drop loot and don’t have timers.
---
now that would be a fun mechanic to see become real.
---
Spectre leadership has swapped from team America to euros :/ 
---
Policy changed
---
In this particular instance when we say market we mean the whole thing not just jita itself, what would be the point of only targeting jita if it can be avoided by other trading hubs?
---
Hmmm maybe I should be looking into WH's. I trained deep into lasers compared to missiles. I can use any sub cap t2 laser but working towards t2 missiles will take around 2 months for all sizes sub cap.
---
Now thats the type of local chat I live for
---
People will just stop bothering with sovereignty and leave the game, it'll be downright impossible for smaller groups, as anything they drop will vaporize within days. 
---
An NPC doesn't have a timezone, and if they can also entosis, the sandbox will die. It all sounds cool from highsec, where people long for the same rewards as in null, but are scared to actually go there. It's naive. CCP is stretching the limit without fully interfering with the player sandbox, but what you stated will never happen.
---
its called spread sheets online by players for a reason, and its not because of how simple it is.
---
&gt; So I'm putting money where my mouth is and will be leaving Horde....  
---
&gt; Actually I am in Horde 
---
Make up your damn mind.
---
Maded's other account, or someone who's oblivious to how much better it was back then ?
---
You sound like you got way too comfortable in your null pad. Everything you've said happens in high sec to players every day. Null space should have the most risk from both NPC and player. However, too often you face NPCs on your terms and it's now changed. I'm sure it won't last more than a week so be thankful for that. High sec players won't have that same luxury.
---
Trial by fire
---
Those people would have to attack structures under a super/titan umbrella so...
---
Hail!
---
Wow, thanks for sharing! I understand that the game has a steep learning curve, and will try to persevere through it.
---
Thanks again.
---
Not much into building , but isn’t building ships in a 3,8% index system kinda bad ?
---
I guess Triglavian fleets are coming to WAFFLES!
---
Kolaghan StormsFury
---
And what they're mad about is that they can't keep *on* doing it. Flow my fucking tears that the jfg bandwaggonners who joined are disappointed about this. Fuck em.
---
Ive been saying to make titans easier to kill since pl/nc/raiden were painting my drakes and tracking them with their guns in 2011.
---
Keep at it, maybe they’ll hear you this time.
---
Just another day in New Eden.

beep boop Burn Hisec
---
I pray for the day US spectre leadership kicks out the retarded EU "npsi alliance" boys
---
While we do not exclusively fly Amarr, LUMEN is an alliance that due to our devotion to the Empire biases towards Amarr doctrines. We also often fly with allies such as PIE or other militia corps. If your interested dm me here.
---
There's a lot of shit being posted so its hard to find details sometimes. So far they don't seem to be using DD's on players, but a few people have pointed out structures seem to be taking damage that would match the amount put out by their DD mechanic + their regular guns.
---
But isnt he like ... vanished into a C3 or something?
---
I’ve seen this fucker around a lot, he’s weird
---
with the high standards most nullsec corps have, from a highsec player's POV (voice a must, api checks and whatnot), and the fact that many highsec people are more the casual type, mostly not interested in commitment and pvp, i don't think null corp visibility in highsec will do much to change the demographic.
---
also, with nullsec people coming as "attackers", there's a very clear "us vs them" that will likely broaden the rift between the two groups.
---
The past two times I tried playing, I subbed and unsubbed within 2 weeks.
---
What's different now? I put a little money into the game. Take advantage of the $5 1M SP DLC, use it to boost your Magic 14 training. If you have a job and make decent money, pick up some of the PLEX-package DLC's as well. Don't bother with shitty ISK-making methods when you can easily make several times that amount sweeping floors at McDonalds.
---
With some of the mandatory training time skipped and a decent bit of starting capital, it becomes much easier to get into the activities which are arguably more fun than what the typical alpha newbie can do.
---
For example, I came back to get into solo PvP. A decent T1 fit is about 10-15m, and if you put $10 into plex you'll be able to blow up about 100 of those without having to grind your money back between fights. That means you can spend your time in-game doing what you want, instead of saving up to eventually try it.
---
Finally, this should go without saying, but JOIN A NOOB-FRIENDLY CORP. You can eventually go fully solo and be self sufficient, but its a massive help to learn the ropes from people who are better than you. Look into some of the major corps for whatever activity you want to get into, or EVE University if you're still unsure of what you want to do.
---
Gewbal could fuck the plex market and hurt everyone but that would hurt goons too, so it won’t happen.
---
&gt; Would you expect anything else?
---
They were responding to "nothing could have possibly changed". Their data appears to match expectations, and their repeat visits to some systems suggests a trend that *could* be applied to all other systems in high-sec. Obviously it's not guaranteed, but it's probably right more often than wrong.
---
I don't know why leshaks get the hate that they do as if we want to go back to lokis online where nobody dies cause triage is retarded. Leshaks provide more than enough dps to ensure losses on both sides, you just have master the support ships like booshers and ecm to counter the enemy team.
---
6 years is to generous
---
You see a lot more Amarr-style ships in Wormholes. The strategic value of the wormhole itself on grid helps some amarr ships shine.
---
WHSOC is recruiting!
---
Some Amarr ships we fly on a weekly basis include... Legion, Confessor, Absolution, Sacriledge, Guardian, Pontifex, Deacon.... probably a few more I'm forgetting!

The only thing your fitting tool needs is a way to add stuff from the market (à la PyFa) it has potential to be as big as Osmium was before ESI.
---
Alright, I see where you're getting at. Thanks for the tips, my man! I'll certainly make use of the 5$ 1M SP pack.
---
Swap an LSE for a 2nd inv. You'll have more EHP with that setup anyway.
---
when online numbers fall from 30k (5-10k players) to 5k (1k players), maybe.
---
also, there's still no alternative to eve, and none planned (let's ignore sc at the moment, no one knows if that will ever come out).
---
What are you smoking ?
---
Splinter into what exactly? Are there big factions in goons I am unware of?

Only weapon system i would find questionable is projectiles. Unless you want to fly armor lokis.

Looking at his kill board, he really likes that triple rep. Spoiler alert, the other two I saw in the very brief scroll down were losses. Who could have predicted this?
---
we have a lot of stations sure, but not 7600+
---
This is EvE good on you comrade.
---
Speak to your rental manager
---
Rattle does vindi level dps...
---
Gila is already a great ratting ship, but you can't easily 100MN AFK fit it.
---
Undock your blingiest ship and offer it as tribute in null?
---
Spooly spooly blob ship bad.
---
idk that we strictly would have. Because you have to account for the burnout of titan pilots. And the burnout of people to aspire to being a titan pilot, burning out before finishing the long training.
---
More than likely he was just gating through space like an space faring american gold hunter during the gold rush.
---
I'd say move into the Uni wormhole, but unless it's changed recently, I think it's pretty dead for content.  Good place to learn the mechanics, of course, and to do PI, but otherwise it's reliant on random connections for good chains.
---
&gt; when TF are they gonna fix battleships? I miss my rattle.. but it’s more expensive, dose less DPS.. Targets Slower.. ect. ect.
---
Battleships are fine, it's carriers that need fixing (i.e. nerfing), particularly application and the NSA. And yes I know application got nerfed a bit but not enough.
---
Regarding scan speed, the quickest scan speed is 4.05 seconds, reduced from the base scan speed of 10 seconds. This is with Astrometrics 5, Astrometric Acquistion 5, the AQ-710 implant (requiring Cybernetics 5) and the Scan Acquisition Array II module (requiring Astrometric Acquisition 5). The skills reduce scan time by 5% per level whilst the implant reduces scan time by a flat 10% and the module reduces scan time by a further 20%.
---
First of all, cite your source.
---
Second of all, how many of that majority actually live in null, and of them how many have to play drifter whack-a-mole all day?
---
Its time to pet and kiss my dusty Domi again.
---
Yes, good job!
---
Your argument is that the HS manufacturers will be fine because 1) NS guys will smuggle stuff into HS and 2) HS manufacturers will just stockpile their stuff rather than competing with cheaper, imported goods.   
---
1. NS smugglers:  NS alliances typically require someone to provide open ESI to \*ALL\* their characters and alts.   I fully expect that the alliances are capable of watching wallets and transactions.  There will be some leaks from the cartel but it's not going to be significant.
---
2. You didn't specifically mention this but there will probably be smuggling from non-cartel members and LS.    This is good; it's a reason for good ole' fashioned PVP.
---
3. Manufacturers will simply sit on their stockpiles until after the embargo.    That's fine, destroying the market works to our ends.
---
I think you missed a few things.  First, there are always war profiteers.   I doubt those stockpiles (if they exist in any real depth) will stay in place once prices start to rise.    Secondly, what are the manufacturers going to do when their supply of raw materials dries up?   Will they go on vacation?   Win Eve?    What will the average HS player be doing while this is going on?    Eventually, either the lack of items or the price of items will impact their ability to play or their enjoyment of the game.   
---
They will complain loudly to CCP.
---
Which is the entire point of the exercise; we want to make HS howl.
---
Oh, re the low tax HS structures?   Yeah, there's already a profit-sharing agreement in place amongst the cartel on those stations so, that's cool.  
---
Final point:   there won't be any glassing of HS.    That's just not practical.
---
More Drifters for the salt throne!
---
Damm thats kinky
---
You've got to be a bit of a prick to manage NS entities (see Mittani, Gobbins, etc)
---
CRUZADOS has some chill sides, but their shitlords are without equal.
---
Yeah one guy on reddit represents the third largest alliance in EVE, time to break that NIP I guess
---
Urban Oxide, who moved to be our LowSec Campus manager a couple of months ago, apparently got it runna lot better recently.
---
Happy birthday, you're not special.
---
What are you gonna do, undock?
---
Some people would consider that  fun evening.
---
TBH I have some respect for someone who is willing to battle-fit a rorq.
---
Can you actually see killmarks on any of the trig ships?
---
I could be wrong and he may be a great dude. I've never had any direct dealings with him. 
---
The prick vibe I mentioned was mainly through his pings that I see when I bother to check that account.
---
You are right though, you have to have a certain attitude when leading a big bloc.
---
I love how CCP says nothing about what the Drifters are sposta do and everyone just applied their own agenda to them, then act surprised when the Drifters don't do what you thought.
---
How can you say there's no impact on botting.  Isn't it reasonable to think several botters are now not botting to avoid constant death?  Could that by why you aren't seeing them die?
---
Oh come on now. So much Grrr Goons.
---
Goons aren’t any worse for new player retention then war deccing or suicide ganking. In fact, we offer a lot of opportunity for new players should they choose to join us. Since our tactics rely on large numbers and affordable ship doctrines, we don’t need elite PVPers in T3’s or faction battleships to win. We are happy to take in newer players and give them a purpose in our machine.
---
One major example: We recruited a lot of Chinese players during the first rounds of the Serenity migration, knowing that if we didn’t, our enemies certainly would. All jokes about botting aside, our Chinese corps have turned out to be pretty good allies. They’ve given us more numbers, better time zone coverage, and lots in ratting taxes. 
---
Above anything else though, I think new players quit because solo play in EVE is garbage. EVE is also a hard game. In order to survive, you need to join a community, but some people can’t be bothered to do that. The people who stick with EVE are the ones who embrace its hardcore nature compared to other MMO’s.
---
I agree. This is just too poorly conceived to be a new permanent feature. Still, if it ends up with me owning a Drifter battleship (even without the DD), it will all have been worthwhile.
---
Nah I'll just make a bad attempt at shittalking on r/eve that's how you win the real war
---
Sending you 9.11 isk
---
the character bazzar is a thing you can always buy a ready made titan pilot for the right amount of isk
---
Calm down goon fag its just a joke 😂
---
Oh good thing you reminded us a few days in advance, now we have time to prepare the biggest gift of all time.
---
Well, we seem to agree on most of the points regarding how this thing will play out, but disagree on our reading of the consecuences of it. Fair enough.
---
I do want to point out that HS industrialist hardly specialize or put too much effort into T2 production, which is the only seriously affected area by the embargo; I'd be willing to bet that most of that already comes directly or indirectly from nullsec producers.
---
So yeah, they might complain a little, but most of them will just build something else. Add to that the fact that HS players are hardly vocal about this things, and you end up with this being a very bad plan.
---
Sorry, but I can't really see anything here besides the same people that usually plays the market doing just that. So nothing new nor interesting here.
---
This is my design.
---
Poor tracking? I’m fairly certain leshak has pretty good tracking if the rest of the line is any example
---
Gonna do the same tbh.
---
It would not.
---
The drifter invasion AI is the same as ordinary rats. The same bugs are even there (infinite-range lock, for example). They just added Citadels to the list of "things I can warp to" and tweaked the frequency of warping between grids. We can see that they're on the old AI because they ignore damage caps, so they're using a different code path which existed before damage caps were made.
---
The Drifter invasion as a feature will live or die by its next stage. As it currently stands it's irritating and really not terribly useful, to both the nullsec narrative or the anti-nullsec narrative. They're too powerful for the first and too ineffective for the former.
---
I was in Waffles a few years ago.
---
Fist day in corp we fought everything from FW farmers to supers. At the end of that day, Grath came into our comms and raged like I've only heard on the tv (supposedly we weren't supposed to be shooting those supers).
---
It was the best first day in a corp. Have fun, Grath and Waffles o7
---
Bob demands sacrifice.
---
I'm actually at a loss for how to respond here. I can't tell if you're trolling or not, but I'll assume you think it takes massive effort to maintain structures now. The short version: no. The long version: the salt is from frustration. A lot of us thought it WOULD be a change that might combat citadel spam, challenge botters, make afk ratting difficult. But no, it's just another annoyance, and not well implemented from what I can tell...
---
Don't think so, Bill.
---
goonz jump to bee-con
---
jettison a freighter full of corpses
---
Silly bee, you need to learn from the elite pilots in NC. They have anticipated this in their 7d-chess simulations of EVE and determined that having structures is no longer an advantage. All that work Goons did glassing Tribute just played into their plan!
---
Holy moly I can see Ikitursa prices now (without logging in)
---
1. Train Shield Upgrades or Advanced Weapon Upgrades higher.
---
2. Swap the Large Shield Extenders to a meta or faction variant such as Republic Fleet.
---
3. Swap ONE Large Shield Extender for another Adaptive Invulnerability Field for more tank, but less capacitor. 
---
4. You probably want to swap the Field Extender rig for another purger too. (This doesn't affect fitting, but it think it would make the fit better imo).
---
Well it was AC Loki, but yeah.
---
Rolex and omega are not luxury watch brands that’s why.

If mittens goal was to trigger the fuck out of people, he has succeeded beyond imagination

Yeaaaah not going to happen

You guys keep sperging about how the goons are REEEing and salty about drifters but this is legitimately the 20th GRRR GOONS post I have since since 6 hours ago. I don't feel like I'm going out on a limb to state the obvious that maybe... *just maybe*... highsec dudes are a wee bit saltier at what's to come?
---
He's astoundingly forgiving in random small gang stuff for fun. The only time I've heard him irritated is on large fleets that go poorly for dumb reasons.
---
He should have gone 3x semiconductor memory cell. Most underrated rig--would have been clutch here.
---
r/punpatrol this man appears to be resisting arrest.
---
I was really thinking of playing again, but this ... event notwithstanding, I really got disheartened by the thought of a single alliance of tens of thousands vs. anything I could help marshal with friends (maybe a few hundred or a thousand people back in 2006). 
---
I'd like to hear some thoughts about whether artificial caps on alliance size, and standings list size and other rigid things like that could help with that. I think supporting larger alliances has just ripped out the foundation and has had CCP spending too much time trying to refocus territory wars for massive blobs or counter blobs, when really, fractious 'small' alliances (by comparison) are themselves a counter to bigger and bigger blob sizes.
---
I hope you post in r/wallstreetbets with that name, that's a solid posting account
---
Yeah ok lol it seems like you are begging for donations
---
Imagine using fag as an attempt at an insult
---
Meh. Life finds a way. I don’t think this will break the market, but I can’t predict what *will* happen. The most likely outcome, imo, is that messy regional markets will suddenly get more traffic, and people will lose money to it, but the economy will remain more-or-less intact, though fragmented.
---
What even is the point, though? As a Goon, and I ask this somewhat sincerely, what do *you* think the point of this blockade is? A flailing response to Drifter shenanigans?
---
For example.
---
Here is a leshak that was lost in the fight (GDNebu) compared to a standard armor megathron for example.
---
http://prntscr.com/o97l47
---
5.11 tracking vs 6.7 tracking.
---
Leshak loaded with occult, megathron loaded with void. 
---
I just mean its not like its a super tracking boat, you could beat them with hacs and other smaller signature stuff, to mitigate their obscene damage.
---
My point was however, that the neuts make any sort of "lets get close" unbelievably oppressive and disgusting. the neut bonus onto the triglavian ships is in error and IMHO should be removed.
---
Gotcha
---
wonder if there was any salt after this little caper by CODE - [https://zkillboard.com/kill/77577399/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77577399/)
---
&gt;Okay so you know when you blow someone else up?
---
What in the actual fug. This is an actual game mechanic?? That's what those bastards that lock my rorqual up are doing?!?!?! I usually just p.a.n.i.c and cyno and they stop when my friends appear....yo fuck this game....that's broken af.
---
can you find me a post by a highsec dude please
---
Look at mapping your resize probe size to your mouse keys.
---
You should be careful about liking that though. That attitude will turn around when the idiot Goons start swarming highsec for a few weeks, murdering everyone and everything they come across.
---
That's the thing...you HSers think "this is what we deal with", but you have no concept. We're used to dealing with super groups dropping on us while we're flying 10b ships, just to have virtually no chance of getting away and hoping our alliance has enough people online and within jump range to come join the fight.
---
The problem here is that the enemy doesn't live by the same rules that we have to, as players. They don't adhere to damage cap, they have DD on battleships that do 800k damage a pop, and you can't track them coming in. Literally *none* of that is true about people or things in HS. They also destroy capsules if you're not quick, which no NPCs do.
---
Most of the nullsec alliances with have space for Amarrian ships in their doctrines. Even on shield fleets, the FC's usually won't turn down a Retribution or a Pontefix.
---
1750 is what I get with ‘augmented’ ogres and C3-X BSC ;D
---
But it’s about 1.8B fit.
---
My carrier gets around 3K DPS for about 1.3B
---
Nah tbh it’s more of everyone not just hs ppl
---
&gt; Would you expect anything else? If the structure serves as an inveestment for an activity, why would that isk be tossed aside without reason just to set up a new one elsewhere? 
---
You wouldn't expect people to reinvest the isk they make doing an activity into something that would let them make more isk?
---
&gt; It'd be like docking up your shiny blinged out incursion ship and spending isk to buy a new one, exactly the same, never using the previous one again. 
---
or you know, docking up your blinged incursion ship so you can buy an even blingeyer abyssal ship
---
Sorry. Six autocannon runs.
---
Oh I'm not disagreeing with that -- it's a stupid mechanic. I was lucky enough to only die twice from the attack yesterday (once from PDS because we couldn't jump away quickly enough, the other in less than a second from a few drifters).
---
Have you tried Star Citizen?
---
And yet still effort being put in that annoys and frustrates so still a significant enough effort.  At this point an annoyance seems good and game ruining :) .
---
I just hear two dudes having fun, and some others secrectly wishing they had their penache. Way too many supahserious people out there.
---
I vote this bot for mod.
---
 Most of the skillpoints is going to basic core skills like enginering,  armour stuff or gunnery.
---
I think part of it is people dont want the min frigates. Rather train amarr or gal frig to V for armor logi or their bombers? That was part of it for me.
---
That still had to wait the full amount of time to train. Limiting the maximum number of them to the number created minus the number burning out and quitting.
---
Why do you think the majority like it? Are the majority of players really in highsec? Because I don't know anyone in null that likes it.
---
I've never understood the posts across every games subreddits/forums etc of people asking 'Will I like this game'. I don't think anyone can answer that question for you, nor should they try to convince you of it. 
---
In the case of Eve have a F2P variation it seems you could answer that question farely quickly by just playing. 
---
Now with that being said, I think it would have been better served to ask which communities, alliances, groups, activities would be good to check out as a new player.
---
You try to hard and game mix with reality for you.
---
And how do you know they don't get hit? Renters and botters will most likely not have any api verification for zkill.
---
And I am simply for that: More players in an area, more active drifters.
---
I believe we have the same goals, a shame we're on opposite sides.
---
I now want you to justify further frustrating and annoying the logistics, planning, scouting, and other assorted content generators in the game. As if their jobs aren't frustrating or annoying enough. And before you say that they deserve to be frustrated, just know that almost nothing of importance or excitement happens in Eve without one of these people, in some Corp or alliance, doing their space jobs
---
I don’t want to witness a Grath rage but I also want to witness a Grath rage. This will be fun

Lol in all seriousness...I stopped playing eve a month ago (structure bash blues) to play elite dangerous again. I do enjoy parts of eve....but structure bashing....is not one of them.
---
yes because losing connection and clicking save means i live in highsec in eve online
---
Damn... What happened to your security status?!? 
---
It's so positive...
---
meh
---
The bigger they are the harder they fall, while crying all the way. (I added that last part)
---
&gt; CCP just giving it their all, per usual.
---
ftfy
---
Yeah they still deserve it, enjoy! :D
---
I like bashing, because I live in wormholes. There aren't a gazillion in *every* system, and when you take the time to do it, you're almost always getting a fight, as well as the dank loot. 
---
Fuck yeah I'll hellcamp a system for dank guerilla warfare content and 40b in loot. 
---
We like it so much we actually *use* structure bashes to generate content. Drop a rait in an occupied system and get a fleet ready to defend it. Bam. Instant fight.
---
The post got too Olmeca-ly, didn't finish. Brevity is the soul of wit.
---
\&gt;guys dumb game mechanic is OKAY because it's only temporary !
---
I think it's less "Will I enjoy this?" than it is "Why would you recommend this game?"
---
In my case it's "What do you think would convince me to look past my long-lasting dislike of the MMO genre to play an awesome game?"
---
Thank you kind sir for keeping an eye on linguistic consistency. Language is always evolving but some of it isn't necessary
---
whats the point to change the ships?the problem is with ur anomalies mate ccp...all i see now is just domie s  in period basis,the ones that warping to cits as soon as u enter local...fix the god damn pve dudes,not the ships
---
Why they don't allow people to pay huge amounts of isk to get adverts up is beyond me. It would be a great isk sink for whales who want to feel special.
---
Carrier application just got the nerf hammer tho, and Titan Haws did too. It actually did a pretty damn good job too.
---
Well played. I salute you all.
---
Is waffles back?!?
---
hmm if your sat in a titan you should have about 40-45 mill sp less and whats the point of having such an   expensive ship that you cant use properly only retards will half arse skills for a titan XO
---
They not speeding up the issues but allow them to overflow new eden.         
---
Injectors are not only letting you have titan at day 1, but also lead to free alt accounts if you can just extract skills.     
---
You can farm more, farm cheaper and get more and more 'free' accounts.     
---
This is killing player niches as ,well if you can make 500 mil on something per month on free account why not put 4 free omega accounts on it.          
---
CCP is gifting free stuff from omega accounts ... hey i just got 30 mil free SP on accounts that i extract any way. Plex getting more and more expensive ?        
---
Fuck smaller players i paid for game time when plex costed 3.9/pu extractors i bought during promotion so they costed even less ... And i am selling injectors like all all plex costed 4.0/pu .... Now i will buy plex for 4.0 and sp will be sold when it will cost 4.1/pu.          
---
Like we didn't need those players any way
---
Bittervet says that this event has run out of gas, no one is scared of drifters now.
---
This is the kind of quality content im still lurking around here for!
---
Shoot First and allies use Amarr ships. Don't know if they recruit.
---
&gt; I'm Not Crying You're Crying
---
&gt;guys mechanic impacts me negatively so its bad even though its probably only temporary and is part of a world arc story.
---
I mean if you want drifter looking ships maybe one day but don't expect the stats
---
I personally killed a fleet of drifters with my super and two others in titans.
---
Maybe I fought a weak fleet?
---
I dunno, I’m not sure why people are making a big deal out of this.  I personally they start tuning up responsiveness of drifters to what players bring, as well as, replacing all pirate faction NPCs with Diamond rats once they have the fine tuning down for it.
---
I love when people fail to understand the actual idea, I’ll post anyway.
---
This is really easy to fix as you can tie it directly into TCU control. Additionally sov mechanics already make it hard to anchor structures in ADM6 systems. If you can’t manage to keep a system ADM6, then you shouldn’t really be having keepstars there as it goes beyond your alliances capacity of manage your space. 
---
The point is to make space easier to take over, encourage more content and prevent citadel spam.
---
My post was clearly intended as a rough idea on how to tie things together, but you seem to have missed the point entirely haha.
---

By dps titan i mean tit 4 and similar stuff.

I agree.  It's always a struggle to balance brevity with an adequate treatment of the source, which in this case offered no shortage of material for ridicule. I tightened it up a bit.
---
He Finaly joined PL's top corp.
---
it doesn't impact me negatively, nice try moron
---
Yeah, that's what I want. If they're on par with faction BS, even better.
---
Tbf only "gaming media" called it f2p
---
This pleases the nut
---
I agree that burning highsec may not be the right thing to do.  But, I think we need to get moving on that and I would rather do the wrong thing and cause havoc rather than just watch it in fear and just "what should we do?"
---
I wish it were like that, unfortunately nothing about it encourages anyone to be undocked long enough to be fightable.  They oneshot any subcaps, so you either have to throw corms at them and eat the losses over the few minutes it takes to kill them or with super/structure bombs.  Both make for fights that end before the enemy could travel 5-10 jumps anyway, even if they knew you were there.
---
So you're twisting my words.
---
My point was that the leshak DOES have ways to beat it, it DOES have vulnerabilities.
---
You can nail vigilants, you can jam/neut vindicators, you can separate them and boosh them.
---
Its also about damage mitigation as well.
---
Here is the dps of a standard leshak shooting a HAC without webs with occult: https://prnt.sc/o97ywt

That would really be scraping the barrel for the least enthusiastic. Can you imagine it? Rope all these old veterans together?

---
\&gt; Vets start rambling about what doctrine to fly and how nerfed each ship is now.

Makes me nostalgic for the S&amp;I "Grrrr, miners should strike because (hulkageddon|CODE|the weather|it's tuesday)!  We'll show those PeeveePee players where the REAL power is!!!!1!one!eleven!" posts of yore, tbh.
---
I absolutely agree.  They get mad at CCP and then decide to attack hisec (not that itll do anything but probably just make people log off for a while?  I mean its unlikely anyone is actually going to fight) out of their own spite and the fact that their own rhetoric is being tossed back at them.  This is a knee jerk temper tantrum by not just Mittens but by what looks like all the major null block leaders.  Congratulations, your plan will push people further away from agreeing with you rather than towards it.  I hope CCP does keep this going (I strongly believe this is temporary as part of a world arc story line and Imo thats fine for some annoyance) and tells the big null leaders to deal with it and HTFU.  Your reaction is frankly ridiculous and petulant.
---
Oh shit sorry now i remember you.

For some strange reason i mixed you with Elise .... like this is why i didn't expected this retard level statements from 'you' aka Elise.

Move along.

Now that i think about this i have no idea how i managed to mix someone acting so dumb with Elise ......    
---
Like WTF i feel embarrassed by this
---
In a small system you can drop a probe at 64 AU and the scan strength is essentially constant, so the % value tells you the signature strength. That isn't enough to uniquely identify a sig, but it can narrow it down to a few choices.
---
Anything that becomes popular people hate.  Once it becomes ironically cool to be against something the bandwagon picks up speed.

Leshaks4eva
---
r/eve has been nothing but posts that are either making a big deal out of the Imperium undeploying from the North to deal with the Drifters assault, furiously fellating CCP for some reason, or both.
---
It's getting pretty tiresome. Maybe u/jibrish and company should make a megathread for people to post about this shit in so the subreddit has a better signal/noise ratio?
---
It's not like we need twenty different posts that boil down to "I don't like goons and want CCP-senpai to notice me."
---
"see past partisan reasons?"  That doesn't mean what you think it means.   and yeah it does impact you negatively, nice try moron, otherwise you wouldn't be whining so hard about it.  Stop behaving like a child and throwing your toys across the room because everything isnt just as how you want it.  You're part of the problem, not the solution.

Can you be less gay?  Thanks.

Not so much true anymore. The high end ones have moved into a lot of triglavian ships.
---
Deflection is a symptom of being butt hurt
---
&gt;There ought to be risks associated with investing time and isk in structures which you are ill-prepared to defend.
---
Any player organization that would attack Delve would find it's not so ill-prepared. The problem is when NPC suddenly becomes the aggressor. Whoever claim they saw it coming are talking BS.

Join the GM team?

Are you forgetting the spool mechanic?  A jam, miss, or burn out of range and you fuck their dps.  Seems like a solid balance to me.

BACK TO SARANEN BY 2020
---
Wow code left highsec.
---
The Prophecy say that at the end of time, Merkelchen will bring Karmafleet against the rest of Goonswarm, and that the winner of the Great Beepocalypse will unleash DBRB on the four empires.
---
What you think the Drifters are for? :p
---
As I said, its not their DPS that I find oppressive, at all, for the above stated reasons.
---
For me, its the neuts that make them oppressive.  
---
1 heavy neut, and 3 medium neuts perma run?
---
Thats silly.
---
Or ya know, if you’re having tracking issues don’t use t2 ammo and swap to something like tetryon..
---
&gt; I agree that burning highsec may not be the right thing to do.
---
I can't imagine why burning highsec would ever *not* be the right thing to do.
---
But here's the thing.  
---
These drifters represent a threat that was unexpected because no information was available. It shows how weak the CFC really is at the core and that they can't really deploy without getting spanked. One would've thought with the sheer numbers they have, that they can muster an alt fleet to deal with it.
---
Did you legit do. TLDR and then follow it up with 8 paragraphs?
---
Minus anything to do with defending or taking SOV this is spot on.
---
I'm selling tons of soap on a rope. PM me in game for a good deal.
---
They need to have the old dd mechanics, where they can open a cyno and dd through it, killing everything in system instantly, including structures. 
---
Make eve hard again!

Hope springs eternal, I guess.

I'm looking forward to what comes next.

Your language offends me.

Bro, just visit those spaces.

I'm happy if CCP answers the question. You do understand that I'm advocating drifters actually EXPAND their attacks rather than cut them down.
---
what happens after they fall??? don't leave me hanging
---
We were wondering when this post was going to be made. FYI I've hugged Grath. He's not nearly as scary as people think he is.
---
&gt; nice try moron, otherwise you wouldn't be whining so hard about it.
---
sad and depressing worldview you must have, that no one can believe in something without ulterior motives
---
Was the FC of that fleet Yngstrom by any chance?
---
The part that strikes me the most about these "salt" posts is the existence apparently very large population of players who get off on CCP making other people's lives miserable. Like, people are genuinely happy that CCP added a mechanic that forces people to waste X hours each day citadel gunning for no rewards besides structure maintenance.
---
I can understand getting off on your actions making other people's lives miserable, or cheering on another player group who makes the lives of a player group you don't like miserable. But uhh, cheering on CCP for making pointless busywork only encourages them to add more pointless busywork elsewhere.
---
This has as much meaning as forcing the player to play tetris for 10 minutes whenever they take the acceleration gate to an FW plex, and if you don't clear 200 lines you ship explodes.
---
It is good thing that through this "event" people such as yourself have found a voice.
---
If you're not whelping expensive ships or a bunch of cheap shit on the regular, what's the point of farming those havens/sanctums and rorqual mining.
---
Farming isk is the boring and annoying part of Eve. Fitting up random ships and shooting people is fun. Especially if you're in a capital or tanky BS and get to actually have a long fight. These guys probably had a great time
---
Shitpost on Reddit about it
---
They are luxury brands, no matter their actual exclusivity, in the same way in which Mercedes is a luxury brand despite the millions of 20k cars they sell. Cadillac always outsold yet was never able to equal Rolls Royce, and both were luxury brands.

I think we have different ideas as to what luxury brand means sorry.

Goons or drifters?

Honestly, I agree.  But, I needed to say so that I could use the quote from Hilmar when he was talking about shaking up nullsec.
---
you too
---
No, I legit did a TL;DL for a _30 minute recording by the leader of your entity_, and then followed it up with 8 paragraphs.  Paragraphs, by the way, are a structure by which written thoughts are organized.  Paragraphs also typically cease being a disheartening obstacle around 3rd grade when children learn to read more quickly.

Honestly, I agree.  But I needed to say that so that could use the [quote from Hilmar](https://youtu.be/Kr3JwrR7GBs?t=131) about shaking up nullsec.

titan 4 XO you houldnt be undocking a titan till you have all relevent skills to 5

Said the moron attacking high sec players for something out of their control and effectively alienating them more.  What a sad and depressing world view YOU must have if the what Null seccers are saying is " a small annoyance" is causing such a kneejerk temper tantrum out of you.  
---
&gt; and you're stupid 
---
Mmm no, that would be you for being unable to see past your own failings.
---
i feel attacked...
---
Well, I take it in the literal, by-the-book meaning. Luxury branding can exist at a variety of price points, depending on the target customer. From a common man's perspective, Rolex is one of THE luxury brands. For a multimillionaire? Not so much, sure.
---
But there are a million common men for every millionaire, so why should our definition of luxury be formed around the tastes of someone who sees a 10k watch as an ordinary item?
---
Imagine being content with the subreddit being flooded with driveling idiots scrambling to post their disorganized, rambling screed about "goons bad grr goons grr mittens".
---
Hey just a quick suggestion if you'll take it. Seems like you're using bulma. If so, change the anchor in the navbar to `&lt;a class="nav-link support-us" href="/support-us"&gt;Support us&lt;/a&gt;` to `&lt;a class="nav-link button is-primary" href="/support-us"&gt;Support us&lt;/a&gt;` maybe. So it has the rounded corners. 
---
I use Bulma a lot so if there's a place to submit feedback lemme know :)
---
This is 2019 better have 4 good titans rather 1 all V
---
Why, though? He's not your leader. Why waste your time with agitprop that doesn't affect you?
---
I find it funny they want everyone to be ok with being attacked by players at random but get up set when Npcs do it, that's taking it to far
---
It doesn't count if you sneak up, hug him from behind and then manage to out run him. ;P
---
This is a normal life interaction, right?  I'm not jaded by this game.
---
Yea, cause they've never played with me before right cheese dick?
---
Picturing this brought me to tears mate.

I didn't know if would be so emotionally devastating to you for everyone to find out you're inbred.....
---
I want to run Missions for the Sisters of Eve. I have 3 Agents available. One each in High/Low/Null - Sec. Do the NPCs get stronger in Nullsec? Do the Agents pay better in Nullsec? In general: What are the differences between the Agents of different security - levels?    
---
Thank you for answering my noobish question.
---
Listening to mittens is painful.
---
Lol. K
---
&gt;The point is to make space easier to take over, encourage more content and prevent citadel spam.
---
And my point is your idea does the exact opposite.
---
To actually take over someone's space in the current meta, you're going to need staging citadel(s).  Defending those citadels is one of the major tasks you are going to have to accomplish and the major way the defender repels your invasion.
---
You don't live there, so you can't as easily flash-form a defense fleet to respond to a random NPC attack compared to your opponent.  So Drifters hurt you more than them.
---
The defender can also completely fill up all the "slots" in your system with Citadels before you even arrive, making citadel spam worse and making your staging citadel the primary target of the Drifters.

I take it literal to. As in a brand that provides luxury. As literal as it gets a state of great comfort or elegance, especially involving great expense. 
---
But you are welcome to your own interpretation.
---
I would suggest Eve University to help you learn the ropes.
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page
---
This is their wiki and is one of the best sources of information about the game that I’ve ever encountered, and I would highly recommend that you utilize it as best as you can whenever you need help or feel out of your depth. (I found myself very frequently lost as a newer player before I found this.)
---
After you get the hang of the basic controls and have your head on straight, figure out what type of gameplay interests you. There is: (in no specific order)
---
PvP: (Small gang: 2-10 pilots, Medium: 15-40, Large: 40-80, Fleet Fights: 80-7,000+ or however many the server can handle before we break it... again)
---
PvE
---
Mining
---
Industry
---
Scanning: (Relic Sites, Data Sites)
---
Wormhole Life: (Living, Day Tripping, etc)
---
Planetary Interaction
---
Hauling: (Space Trucking, Corporation/Alliance Level Logistics)
---
Market Trading
---
And a whole bunch of other forms of gameplay that I can’t think of at the moment, but I’m sure others will mention some throughout the thread.
---
There are a lot of really good new player friendly alliances out there in null-security space, if that happens to be what interests you.
---
Brave Newbies
---
Karmafleet
---
Pandemic Horde
---
All three of these are good choices as a newer player, but don’t let anyone make your choices for you. Figure out your own way in Eve, and treat it like your own personal story in a 16 year old ongoing space opera.
---
Oh please do, and good luck to you. You'll need it.
---
You have a 30 minute recording of Sister Bliss? With or without the rhoomba?
---
I guess joining pl was worth it after all.
---
When was the last time that asshat lead anything init did?
---
Oh man the delusion is so real my friend. Mix in a salad and maybe things will become clearer.
---
You can only defend these with a very specialized fleet or supers. I can defend my space from other players with tons of other fleets and normal caps.

Yeah. If you lose a fight, have some class and say good fight even if you don’t really feel like it. Insulting someone who just beat you means you’re dumb as well as lacking in self control.

it isn't even a threat. it's MANDATORY pve gameplay

You have to understand -- these people have been incredibly powerless for so, so long. Having even the slightest, abstract inkling of hope overpowers what little ego they had in place to constrain them; spilling id all over the internet like the end result of an aggravated amoebic dysentery infection.
---
We are always open for suggestions. But your suggestion won’t work as we are not using Bulma but Bootstrap 4 😉.

But..... got to say that design suggestions are always welcome as we are a bunch of developers without any sense for design haha.

You van leave your feedback on our Github page [https://github.com/Lionear/Eveworkbench.Issues](https://github.com/Lionear/Eveworkbench.Issues)  or on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dA3kHUv)

Ah yes, I forgot, init is strong independent nullsec alliance with complete autonomy from goons.
---
[Wrong shape for that](https://i.imgur.com/YYu3EWQ.png)
---
Although I agree that 1m SP for $5 is a nice boost, if you do that when you’re brand new you might not have the knowledge to wisely apply those skill points. This is OK though, because you don’t have to use them right away if you decide to go with that option, you can save them for later when you figure out what type of gameplay interests you.
---
Yes. And for a common man, a Datejust provides status, comfort and elegance, at GREAT expense. What's so hard to understand about the idea that most people see a 10k watch as a luxury item? I feel like I'm talking to an alien who doesn't understand basics of human branding and economics.
---
You're welcome to Google "Rolex" and see just how many times the word "luxury" comes up. You're also welcome to be a snob, and wrong.

You could try pinging your alliance mates to stop posting and that would cut it down plenty
---
Well said mate.
---
Then, by all means, go back into FW and try to do FW missions. Depending on your faction of choosing, you might be able to do it in t3 destroyer / stealth bomber / t3c quite safely, and even if your faction is at lvl1, you will still make better isk than running lvl4s in highsec :) most of FW missions are blitzable. Also plexing in some backwater system can make you enough money to keep welping frigates/destroyers. Under certain circumstances FW is the best moneymaking activity you as a newbro can do.
---
I've spent some time in FW so in case you want to chat a bit sent me a pm and I can give you ideas.
---
Even if youre not bitter waffles is pretty dope

Nothing to do with snobery merely the meaning of words.

They regroup into smaller territory that is more suitable for defense.
---
I think my rambling screed was organized quite well, thank you.
---
Imagine making shitposts like yours and feeling the time wasted was justified.
---
We aren't attacking highsec, we are roleplaying drifters and making sure everyone in the game gets to experience the mechanic, not just nullsec
---
Thanks for recording audio and video separately, speeding one up and keeping the other the same.
---
FFS.  
---
Apparently we do need to re-brand if our own members still can't even get one basic branding thing right when trying to meme about fucking branding...
---
It's ProviBloc
---
Provibloc or provibloc are also acceptable. There's no hyphen, no k. How hard is that?
---
Sooo you're code? lol
---
You have to understand -- you people need to get of your horse. Most of the people laughing on reddit about this whole thing aren't even part of the "grrr goons" ocassinal wave. In fact, most members of null powerblocks have either made their assesment of the situation (critically mostly) or have not talked that much.
---
The people making fun of you are people from Wormholes, Lowsec and every non-sov aligned group that doesn't give a fuck about PanFam or Goons, that usually enjoys making fun of other players in-game misery; more so when it comes with MER-level ammounts of salt.
---
You guys are just being amazingly salty about something that noone knows exactly what it is.
---
Deal with it vOv

I'm blessed with huge pec plates, dont be peanut butter and jealous

When I say "these people," I mean folks from all walks of life in Eve. You've all been incredibly powerless for a very, very long time. Heck, where do you think most of your rank originated?

If you’re hesitant about it, consider that the game is about committing and following through. If you lack that, it might not be the game for you.

You talk so much shit about every non-blue/goon but can’t take a joke yourself lmao

Oh hey this looks interesting. I have hardly pvp'ed in EvE but it is something I have always wanted to give a shot.

POD FOR THR POD THRONE
---
I never thought of it that way.
---
Your way of dealing with them requires supers and titans to be at home, ours were deployed for a war. That's the biggest issue we have with it, it effectively kills deploying from your space to go to war.  
---
We had no idea if they'd follow up on timers.  
---
We had no idea if HOSTILES would follow up on the timers made by NPCs.  
---
Our space is littered with NPC stations, any entity seeing a super and 2 titans shooting rats while the defense fleet is away can easily dread bomb them.  
---
The rats bug out and sometimes attack structures from outside of the structure's range.
---
Buy some, use them on kitchen sink fleets
---
Im just old... but Waffles is the only place I can call home
---
What will the new bot hunting meta be now? I need to fit stuff up now that I wont be killing VNIs.
---
So you’d have to take out a sub cap fleet or normal caps to deal with them.
---
I think Carriers and maybe dreads would probably work.
---
Then... don't? Doctor, it hurts when I do $THING!

Either you lack the ability to answer or the question or you lack the comprehension skills to understand the question asked. Either way, you have proven you are not someone I should waste my time paying attention to. Have a nice day. Bob Bless.

Question: Isn't holding Sov a reward in it of itself? I keep seeing these statements that null blocs have to do all these tedious work to keep the drifters at bay, with zero benefit, yet they deny that holding all that Sov, and the ability to utilize it, is a reward in and of itself?
---
Perhaps CCP chose to make owning null space a bit harder in 2019 since they saw the staleness of null bloc warfare in it's current state? If they are wanting to see a "dynamicness" to Sov, yet they aren't seeing it happen via PvP, is it crazy to think they'd consider using PvE mechanisms to force a change?
---
How dare he!  Only CCP is allowed to drive new players out of the game in huge numbers!
---
This
---
God forbid they fight people out numbered.
---
This is absolutely a subscription-based game;  think of the F2P mode as an unlimited trial and nothing more. It doesn't give you that much of an idea of what the game could be like, but it should let you know whether or not the core gameplay is something that you enjoy.
---
Considering what you can find in a game like this, the sub is quite negligible and absolutely worth it assuming that you're willing to put in a bit of time. This is the kind of game where you get what you put in, nothing more, nothing less;  nobody will hold your hand or light up landing flares to content you would enjoy, you need to go out there and find like-minded people and/or create it for yourself.  If you're willing to do that, however, I don't think that there's a better gaming experience out there today.
---
You just made like a 10 page wall of text post about The Mittani's posting. It truly is a salt filled affair on all parts.

Just glad to see another old Corp making a comeback and the drama and fanboys it brings out

 O7
---
What you want would require some hardcore machine learning. 
---
How do you account for Alliance 1 being on the far Eastern edge of the cluster, and Alliance 2 being on the far Western edge? They're geographically far apart, so they're less likely to fire at each other regardless of friendliness. 
---
How do you prevent the system being tricked by having pre-arranged fight with rookieships or other cheap nonsense to give the appearance of 'Oh, A is shooting B, they mustn't be friends'?
---
As I said, something like this would need ML to work. You'd have to gather your training data(of player behaviour without the standings system). Then you'd have to annotate/label it(correctly hand-label the 'true' friendliness of each alliance WRT each other). Good luck with that.
---
So, wait -- I thought that we were supposed to be spreading out, to diffuse the power of the supercapital umbrella. Now we're supposed to be making our territory smaller? Which is it?
---
Your claim that “We can say that they are on yhe old AI because they ignore damaga caps” can be explained just as easily by CCP using the new code for drifters and setting it so they, you know, ignore damaga caps.
---
Yet they won the engagement 🤔
---
Ah yes, the classic "You beat me, so you're bad at this game" thought process.
---
Humans really are unevolved creatures.
---
What's most surprising to me is how much most of the goons members I see posting here don't speak as people, but almost spokesmen for their organization. I've been in the imperium a couple times, and leadership aside it seems like the whole point of being in an organization like that is so that the majority of people can essentially just be drones. I'm sure it's relaxing to have all independent personal autonomy taken away, to go days without making an actual choice even during your recreational time, but I don't think it's complimentary to your members. There is mostly lockstep marching, lack of self criticism, and self importance, patting yourselves on the back the whole way about how "successful" you are. Goon Reddit posts are the eve equivalent of Fox News.

---
Drifters don't attack sov, though. They attack structures.
---
I recommend faction warfare corps. The fleets aren't too huge, and you can make an impact without being in anything too difficult to skill into. A lot of the FW corps are very welcoming to newer players and are patient in teaching them how to be helpful. That's how I started and just collected knowledge along the way.
---
I think I can collectively say from all entities not associated with the imperium.
---
Bring it on retard!
---
You'd be wrong, then. All of nullsec is siding with the Imperium on this one.
---
Lest go evict goons again. (no troll \ sarcasm)
---
The same could be said about any money making activity in eve. The difference is that broadly speaking people agree that the risk-reward ratio is too skewed in sov null. Almost everyone, goons included, want nullsec to be riskier. This implementation does add some risk for sure, but more than anything it adds pointless tedium. Destroying endless swarms of NPCs so that you can have the option of shooting more NPCs or rocks isn't exactly fullfilling.
---
Using PvE as a barrier for players to overcome is a concept that works well in WoW and OSRS, but eve is not built to accomodate PvE in the same way. Eve is a game about risk through PvP so throwing in PvE mechanics is bound to cause a clash between these styles, hence the salt.
---
Ok,
---
Bring it on retards!
---
That better?
---
CCP letting Amarr get away with risk adverse game play
---
CCP doesn't fuck up THE game, they fuck up YOUR game.
---
Literally any XLASB cruiser fit would disagree.
---
So, as a veteran pilot in Brave Newbies, one of the noob corps in null, I can speak to this point. If you join Brave with no experience, you'll come to our staging system GE- and you'll get a bunch of free ships and tutorials and stuff. You have access to our Dojo channel and standing fleet comms to ask any questions you need. And people will 100% answer any and all questions for you happily.
---
You will be part of the blob. Unless you go out our your way to get in on small gang roams and stuff, you aren't going to learn many skills beyond how to respond to something in standing fleet, which is basically, fly whatever you want, get there, and blob the shit out of them if tackle did its job, get blue balled if not.
---
You WILL learn skills. You just probably aren't going to learn very high level skills without going out of your way to. Which, to be fair, is the case in most parts of the game.
---
But what you WILL get with Brave or similar is a huge support network.
---
something something nanobots shifting around on the hull something something
---
That’s something I was wondering about. Should I find a huge Corp or is a smaller one just as good. What’s the benefits of a larger one vs a smaller one?
---
Excellent! That is a very helpful place
---
Don't structures aid player alliances in defending Sov? Or am I confused about their in game purpose on a meta level?
---
I literally hate nullsec and goons and I agree that the drifters are doing a bad job.
---
Switch a large shield extender for an adaptive invul.
---
Believe it or not, there really are players who don’t go to null where their reason why is in no way fear but rather having to do with not wanting to rat the game away, take 47 jumps to find a defense fleet that just docks up, or simply because they don’t want to be the 5,001st hemorrhoid in a corp.
---
Seriously, it’s true.
---
Only thing of his outnumbered were brain cells
---
But drifters actually create content
---
for anyone interested this is the meet up discord,  we generally try to meet second thursday of the month. 
---
## [https://discord.gg/9997hzJ](https://discord.gg/9997hzJ)
---
Goons can read?
---
Thanks man!
---
That really wouldn't solve any problems nor is it just goons apparently onboard with their temper tantrum.  It is also just not possible for the rest of the game to do so I believe ( excluding null sec as they seem to universally be on board with this nonsense.)
---
Again though, that would mean people would have to be back at home instead of participating in the war. They would have to take out fleets almost daily (again, this was an unknown since ccp didn't say anything) for an unknown duration. Just to shoot rats.  
---
Maybe undeploying -was- an overreaction, but when you're getting 170 citadel notifications out of nowhere one day, overreactions are better than under-reactions.
---
Don't you guys have over a hundred of the fucking things? You ever hear of spreading assets? You sure seem to do it well with keepstars, bots, and cyno/intel alts.
---
Literally just a dozen guys in catalysts.
---
I thought you guys were smugging about the fact that a single citadel gunner can clear them?
---
U need a new tag
---
Was all my fault.
---
RKK?
---
im a dane and played on/off since 2003, ive done everything.
---
imo:
---
i think the game in its current state is still fun. its pretty much what it has always been gameplay and mechanics wise, everything has got one or more reworks throughout the years, stuff has been added and then removed again. the longer a game is running, it become increasingly difficult to add new content without spoiling any of the current content and eve has run for many many years.
---
eve was epic before they introduced skill boosters. thats what got me in the end. the shine is gone, shes nothing but a shadow of her old self. currently 25k players primetime average i might add. i see a player in a fancy ship, i show info and the player is 2 months old. skill boosters eliminated the magic for me. 
---
null use to be full of wars, now zero RvR, maybe a citadel is put in reinforced every now and then but its NOTHING compared to how it use to be. i think for the majority of the people who quit, i think the skill boosters is to blame. skill boosters and f2p. 
---
just my 2 cents, take it or leave it :p
---
If you have forgotten everything you were probably pretty new anyway. Go to the website of eve university and teach yourself or join a Corp that can teach you
---
That alliance is such hitting cancer. You know I solo'd one of their rorqual fleets in a Loki? Someone actually showed up when it was almost dead and I left system to see what would happen. Dumbass didn't even dock up, just logged off. 
---
With an engagement timer. 
---
Yeah. Didn't go well.
---
they target active structures in order to (in my opinion) create windows of vulnerability for other people to attack, or to punish larger alliances for spreading out across half the galaxy.
---
confirming all your fault. Can we go back to mission running now??
---
why are you still playing this game?
---
Fun fact: 
---
You can lose ships in this game. Adapt or die, and harden the fuck up.
---
They just control 3 regions, calm down
---
HS: lol htfu and adapt!
---
NS: okay we're going to come to HS though
---
HS: no not like that
---
Looks like it was fun, nice video.
---
But you can't alpha clone ishtars
---
Yeah they're basically just code but with more whining
---
*Enlarge*
---
Then you're wrong.  Great talk.
---
WILL be leaving. Off to try out wormhole life
---
Guy seemed butthurt that a spaniard goon is solo roaming
---
Dyno-Saucer field.
---
According to Mr. Head Bee, only a few structure gunners are actually affected since its a chore for them to,
---
 "Cross half the Galaxy", which again is just him spinning shit to victimize the 3% of people who actually do the structure gunning. which is also that alliances choice to have so few people able to man structures and so many structures int he first place.
---
Fun fact:
---
You can Dscan anything else that will get you.. besides drifters... and they instalock and scram you.
---
I’ll double down tho.. he was an idiot for gating it.
---
If you look at code close enough you’ll find remarkable overlaps in alts and accounts and prior corps.
---
you were obviously never in imperium
---
The game has risk. See above. 
---
Your intel nets and bots, and that entire alliance runs on a goddamn server farm, won't save you.
---
butter and jelly
---
They can. I have no idea who the fuck this guy above you is.
---
Isn't that how null "PvP" works though?
---
Basically CCP came out in a talk session one of them stated that null sec was never supposed to be like it is now and its their fault for Coddling null bears. They are attempting to fix it now (in my opinion) by punishing people for spreading out to far and for getting to big since drifters open up alot of random vulnerability windows that only affect uber large alliances.

You can't nitpick certain traits of a ship that are good and call it overpowered.  You must consider it as a whole.  It's slow as fuck, doesn't track great, and like I said it doesn't do a constant 2k dps, you can shut it off.  It's not like there isn't a counter to it, they are killable.  They're not pre nerf T3C's ffs.  Adapt or die.
---
But no one knows what the full extent of this "world event" is? What if we find out (through Scope News or another means) that Drifters are specifically attacking "citadel sprawl" for example? What if we find out the goal here is to cause "tedium" if an in-game entity is spread out too wide (structure wise) for their gunners/ACL people to handle easily?
---
&gt;Eve is a game about risk through PvP
---
And no one was causing any sort of PvP risk to those structures, that's my point? Perhaps CCP is tired of the staleness of null and the amount of citadel sprawl that exists currently? Who knows, but the amount of people posting as if the past week's drifter attacks are the "end all be all" of this event don't understand story arcs and definitely didn't follow the progression of the Trig Invasion in HS.
---
There's a multitude of ways CCP could go from here with the drifter attacks, there's clearly a storyline element that's involved here, and it obvious has to do with the Trigs in some manner (timing of the attacks so close to the World Ark appearance)
---
Wait, what were we talking about again?
---
Everyone in thread is laughing at chimping Spaniard, reading comp is hard
---
CODE has entertaining RP.
---
I keep hearing that CODE us an alt corp of some NullBloc. Generally not what whoever tells me this is part of.
---
In fact every null person i've talked to that doesn't have to man structures loves it. The only real people i've heard from who don't like it are mittani, (who isnt everyone and is trying to brainwash his bee swarm into hating it) and gobbins, who is just repeating anything mittani says at this point.
---
Aye, I know, I dont dislike or like code, not anymore, they are super necessary after the war dec changes for destruction in high sec.  They are like the embodiment of death coming for you at the end of your time to keep the scales balanced but with more chaos I guess?
---
I think the real goal of it is to create random vulnerability windows for large alliances to make more wars. Mittani can try to brainwash everyone into thinking its not true. But he himself said only a very small portion of "Structure Gunners" are actually affected by this. Which is their fault for having so few people able to man structures.
---
There's literally nothing rambling about this post. It's a concise callout of shitty logic.
---
Also betterinsurrance.
---
He just admitted that he can’t so
---
It’s really why we still play am I right?
---
But that'd be :effort:
---
Confirming fw is indeed dead. Please ignore the Amarr propaganda they have some how hijacked zkill what you see in those reports are LIES ;)
---
&gt; So far they have killed 0 citadels
---
Come and pray with me Jin!
---
The worst corp in Amarr FW. Dirt 'n' Glitter rocks out with laser wangs.
---
Yup to bad Moo and Corp1 aren’t around
---
I think The main point is more to create random windows of vulnerability that the alliance needs to address or leave themselves open to attack by another empire. It gets the job done, mittens is just trying to sweep that under the rug since he doesn't like it.
---
Init is a goon pet.  Change my mind
---
Whew lad, falling for the flounce.
---
its simply one of, if not the greatest mmo ever created in the history of online gaming.
---
I think the content would be less monotone.
---
Your concept of success is limiting your ability to see that people other than those who share your play style have fun.
---
They attack active structures. Uber large alliances are annoyed because they dont allow everyone to man structures to kill fleets and not all structures are armed to defend themselves. So they have to go around defending their massive sprawl of structures.
---
Really being stretched right now :D
---
Is there a reason that PVE Caldari ships drop Gallente drones? Shouldn't the drones be Caldari?
---
I can't ping anyone to do anything, homie.
---
It's mittens choice to throw a temper tantrum instead of using this as an opportunity to go attack people. Guess its to hard to have people with jump clones. "Oh god, we have structures being attacked back home? oh jeeze i dont want to use my jump clone to defend that oh noooo." Insert temper tantrum here.
---
I just said that I was. It had all the soul and personality of going to the DMV. An utterly hollow and uninteresting experience.
---
Now now, don't be so down on yourself. Your alliance still has value!
---
Please, if CCP has written new code the feature wouldn’t work and we wouldn’t be talking about this.
---
2/10 lazy swipe, please try again.
---
have you tried to maneuver your fleet in crippling 10% TIDI ?
---
It's far from concise.
---
Do you think drifters will care?
---
Oh I understand it. It's still dumb as hell.
---
I’m not bitching about it because if you check my board I haven’t lost a cap to one from being an idiot.
---
I’m bitching because what about the poor small Corp that has to deal with this bullshit and they don’t have the intel, or even cyno-nets that we have.
---
How is a small corp going to deal with these things?
---
What is that newbro that wants to explore null going to think when he try’s it for this first time?
---
There are more posts *about* goons being salty than there are posts by goons being salty.
---
You can't shitpost something into reality, friend.
---
Just because it takes you more than 30 seconds to read doesn't make it rambling.
---
No. People attack to kill ships or take down stations. Drifters literally just see something and go, then sending wave after wave against it. There's no way to prevent or look out for it, like there is with players. There's *always* a way to get warning with players.
---
Shockingly not everyone allowed to gun citadels so it's either people who can gun have to waste their time or you need supers.
---
all you have to do is add the normal video as an audio track, no need to make your life difficult by recording separately.
---
Get gud.
---
For anyone who can't gun their alliances citadels that is the answer. Pro tip 95 percent of people don't have gunner rights.
---
oh, you know. miners talking about the fall of society, dark political stuff and general sadness. Made my mission running more interesting though.
---
Ah yes, the classic "you can have fun or you can have sov" argument.
---
The Astrahus survive?
---
How? They don't come to reenforcement timers except by chance.
---
So... what happened to stay classy?
---
Some people can't read a map apparently
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/77578220/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/77578220/)
---
Nope
---
So basically it's an issue because you're stingy with gunning rights out of choice? Why don't you like . . . adapt ?
---
We never really went away...just lost a not-so-insignificant amount of people to inactivity (myself included) when we joined PL. About a year after, we were dangerously close to being the next corp to WIDOT into SNIGG, so we ripped off the bandaid and went our separate ways to rebuild and get back to max fun/hour, losing most of our Euro's in the process. 
---
We spent the last 8 months rebuilding our numbers, and still have a ways to go, but nerds seem to be enjoying undocking and being on coms again.
---
Hmm dunno but that killmail tells me he didnt rep that much. Roughly about double his base HP. Do vnis run dry that fast?
---
A couple assumptions that are wrong:  
---
1. You're not going to get webbed by a single web.   
---
2. It's not going to be a 90% web. It's going to be stronger.  
---
3. You can bet your bottom dollar if you bring HACs, your opponent is going to bring TPs, maybe even bonused TPs.  
---
4. "implants to reduce sig size" :thonking:  
---
You beat a lesh fleet (on equal footing) with halo-implant HACs, I'll send you 5b. Ridiculous.  
---
Putting the neuts aside, if you want to compare AB HACs (lol) against leshaks and say they can mitigate damage you better use the actual case at hand: not 90% webs, 95%+ webs. Not one web, but multiple. At least 1 TP, most likely more.  Then we can compare the vastly lower ehp numbers of HACs vs "60% damage mitigated"  
---
I'll agree with you on one thing, the neuts really are what push it over the top. But fuck it; fuck caps and fighter application, I'll take an op race of subcaps while this game circles the drain.
---
Not isk, we'll pay in PLEX!
---
Look you will make more money ccp!
---
It’s alright because we’re all cool with each other, none of that was actually malicious
---
&gt;Question: Isn't holding Sov a reward in it of itself? I keep seeing these statements that null blocs have to do all this tedious work to keep the drifters at bay, with zero benefit, yet they deny that holding all that Sov, and the ability to utilize it, is a reward in and of itself?
---
Can't we use this patently moronic argument for literally anything?  Assume, for funsies, that drifters came to high sec.  That should be fine, right?  Because owning a structure, much like holding sov, is kind of a reward in and of itself.
---
Only ihubs and only conjunction with other structures. So is a name plate on a system you pay monthly for., Nothing more.
---
You are the perfect example of the type of idiots making all these posts. Not only are you completely oblivious to something giving the game no benefit but actually injuring a huge portion of it's playerbase, you ALSO insult and condemn someone affected by it to perpetuate a stale meme. All opinions and allegiances aside, mittens is extremely charasmatic. He has the entire backing of the largest coalition in the game, and that speaks for itself. You are literally ignoring something that is simply toxic to this game for the sake of an old shitty meme.
---
Don't play coy, you are part of the imperium
---
You are talking 9 levels above my pay grade. I'm going to assume it was helpful and +1 you.
---
I haven't witnessed it, but it's my understanding this is the purpose of member corporations declaring support for an executor corporation.
---
The CEO of each member corporation can set which corporation they support to be executor, including their own. If a majority of member corporations (I think a simple majority of 51%) support a corporation other than the executor corporation, a mechanic is triggered to change the executor corporation. I don't know if this change happens immediately, or during the next server downtime.
---
As an aside, this is why a lot of alliance leaders will require any new member corporation immediately declare support for their chosen executor corporation. I have seen corporations removed from alliances for declaring support for a corporation other than the executor corporation. EVE politics, etc.
---
So instead of not banning someone, because you are not certain he is banning, you are going to deepdick them by dropping Drifters on them. So if it just happens to be a "normal" semi-AFK person trying to scrape together his titan because he lacks real money to buy gametime, you are going to just ruin his day, every day, over and over. Sounds like a plan.
---
holy shit i never thought i'd see the day
---
THE PEEFECT EXAMPLE!!! "He has the backing of the largest coalition in the game" hahaha
---
The problem is that drifters aren't following up. The end result is a bunch of annoying spam in your inbox. I'm sure CCP is tired of null being stale, but this is a really hamfisted way to solve the problem. Seriously, the drifters just warp around randomly to celestials and structures until they find something to shoot.
---
I also fail to see how a bunch of npc's doing completely random shield timers is going to cause more structure fights. How the hell is the north going to do follow up timers in deep delve? Thats what I mean by these two concepts clashing. They have no integration.
---
Even leadership want nullsec to be riskier, but they refuse to break the diplomatic agreements because that only serves to fuck themselves over. Every major alliance knows what can happen if you are isolated. It's not a reasonable expectation for an alliance to let itself be potentially evicted so that they can have a break from the norm.
---
Everyone complains about the current meta but anyone trying to break the mold gets brutalized. Every alliance is guilty of this.
---
So I should pretend to be an idiot that only understands rhetoric and narrative and heavily deviates from reality? Got it!
---
yup
---
Don't let hope for a better game blind you. I would love it if these drifters had a meaningful impact on nullsec. But they haven't other than become a nuisance. 
---
They don't follow up on timers. They don't actively select targets. Explain to me how the drifters are doing anything beneficial?
---
So you want to hold all of that SOV without having to worry about having actual bodies to defend it? Gotcha
---
Delve tradehub/stager is not getting hit at all. So no. It has like 3 keepstars on a grid and a fuckton of faciton forts. Instead the system next door does get hit.
---
ok ill switch to a command ship =)
---
Actually, member corporations can force a new executor corporation. Each corporation's CEO can "declare support" for an alliance member corporation. If enough member corporations declare support for one corporation (I believe a simple majority of 51%), then the executor role is transferred. I'm not sure if that happens immediately, or during the next server downtime.
---
Carriers? I guess so. Never really looked at the difference lol
---
I didn't say that at all? No one is pulling Goonswarm back from the war other than their leadership. That's a choice **they** are making. Only Goonswarm leadership chose to allow so many citadels to go down in their space. No one, other than Goonswarm leadership is choosing to only allow a few members the ACL rights needed to help defend your space?
---
Why not setup a daily/hourly/whatever rotation, with enough people having ACL rights to not hamstring your hardest working/most useful members?
---
If you want to own entire regions, and you want to fill them with citadels, you should have to put in the work for that in my opinion, something that is sorely lacking in the staleness of current null bloc politics.
---
Who knows what CCP's intentions are with the drifter attacks, but I highly highly doubt CCP regards the current staleness of null to be a good thing and I suspect the drifter attacks are part of a story line to "spice that up".
---
CEOs of the alliance member corporations can force a new executor corp by "declaring support" for their chosen corporation, even their own. If enough member corps support the same corp (I believe 51%), the executor role transfers.
---
milliamp hours?
---
This is exactly what happened when I went for a second row of Oreos as a kid mum cuffed me good in ear had a ringer for a few mins
---
So making nullsec miners (That means PanFam, TEST, Frat and Goons) quit is okay, but making HS miners quit is not okay?
---
They were salty about it. CCP backed today on drifters. The have spwaned only a fraction than yesterday.
---
you all are just gonna ignore Hidden Zenith Amarr and Drifters?!
---
Cmon add more Drama n Salt to your posts
---
weren't you funny at some point ? What happened
---
But here's the thing.
---
Everybody is weak against an invincible faction of relentless NPC whom we know nothing about. Because nobody planned for it. Because nobody could. After 16 years of massive pvp war, taking into account timezones, morale, intel, numbers, and every little things that makes a conflict in EVE very unique, you are forced into a surprise conflict with almost no tools to deal with it.
---
Of course you will adapt. But that doesn't mean it's fun. If we're under relentless attack by a group of players, as we were in Saranen, I signed up for this. I know it's real people knocking down my sandcastle, logging in to fight me, spying on me, writing propaganda to destroy my morale. But NPC ? It's just something CCP spawns. It goes against what I signed up for. We can't strike at the miners. We can't invade their regions. We can't attack their staging. We can't even scan them. Nullsec is forced to defend their stuff or forget everything and let it burn, eventually. CCP took our choices away from us, where's the sandbox ?
---
Could have been. He's on killmails from that day. But I can't say for sure.
---
I stopped playing EVE in December of 2018. But I started a fresh account, never played EVE before, Subbed my 1st account, and I had a friend that owned a wormhole, and he told me about PI. I made about 5b ISK within a month.  
---
Made 2 more account with 3 toons each, plex'd both accounts (using ISK) and got them to where they can have 4-5 planets each pretty quickly, I had 7 toons running between 30-36 planets in total. I was making anywhere between 1-3b/week just doing PI on those toons (nanite repair paste).  
---
Me and 5 friends got rolled out of that wormhole (my main friend owned it for about 4 years) by another corp because my corp mate was ganking said other and they got mad. Found our WH and cleared us out. Losing about 50b in assets, deployables, nanite repair paste, ships, modules etc. etc.  
---
Long story short, yes you can make enough money in-game to be able to purchase Omega status. You only need 2b/month. With 9 toons, and a decent PI setup you can make that in a few days pretty easily.
---
You're literally talking about less monotone when r/eve has had the same post just worded differently for the past year stop your bitching
---
The point isn't to break the market, but rather control it and make everything much more expensive than it currently is.
---
Where abouts? I swear I can't see them on the Drekavac/Ikitursa. Maybe is my graphics settings.
---
Wouldn't you rather it be at the top?
---
Defending from other players is different than defending from some npc event. Every player that would be attacking our stuff would be one less player defending their own things. They would need to stage somewhere, they could be scouted, they DON'T IGNORE STRUCTURE DPS CAPS.  
---
Defending space from OTHER PLAYERS is the pinnacle of this game, no one is on here complaining to CCP that horde was deployed to npc delve. The issue is CCP just arbitrarily implementing this mechanic against nullsec specifically.
---
I personally see this as just a lore event and I dont think its going to last forever, if null seccers are dealing with some annoyance from it, well then enjoy being part of the story or let some of your structures die, its not like its a big deal to them honestly.  I wont say there is a benefit to the drifters because there doesn't have to be one.  That's not their purpose currently.  Before you say well that's the problem they are just Npcs there to annoy you, well so are alot of players too so that doesn't really fly.  But the over reaction of everyone is just inane.  Would I like it if they actually destroyed things?  Yes absolutely, but that would be more when I'd expect a nullsec overreaction, not that'd be anymore justified really...
---
I don't think I've heard anyone say to not do it. In fact, I think everyone has been daring them
---
way to miss the entire point fam
---
On point 1. i would like to point towards PH members who have been grinding drifters in their capital system [https://zkillboard.com/system/30002440/page/11/](https://zkillboard.com/system/30002440/page/11/)  for 11 zkill pages.
---
Gunners sometimes work sometimes they do not. Sometimes you have to throw piles of players for hours to defend.
---
&gt;had a pretty rough time with these drifter fleets
---
&gt;It sounds to me like these fleets can be dealt with by citadel gunners alone
---
I just can't keep seeing this failure of logic and say nothing. It has now been shown that CCP is willing do things like this with no warning. The strategic reason to bring the boys home as soon as this is apparent is that if the threat suddenly becomes potent, you need to be there to deal with it. I really don't get why this is hard to grasp, but there you go...
---
&gt;This sprawling of citadels is a symptom of hitherto unprecedented economic prosperity
---
Citadel spam is a result of citadel mechanics. Remember when you could only have moons+1(Outpost) "structures" per system? Remember when CCP changed this? This has almost nothing to do with economic prosperity. Pools of wealth existed before, and they will exist going forward. Creating bad game mechanics that encourage abuse of wealth seems to be the instigating factor here... 
---
&gt;a success firmly rooted in celestial isolation
---
&gt;lengthy blue-lists
---
What? I'll assume you mean geographical isolation. But still. What?
---
&gt;n+1 centric fleet tactics
---
I'm confused. This is a Goon tactic? Good news boys! We discovered the single greatest tactic for winning a fight in the history of Eve!
---
&gt;Come on now mitts, this is just lazy. Simply saying that they're "poorly coded" is a pretty juvenile criticism, don't you think? 
---
Would you prefer "poorly designed"? How pedantic. You either understand the point or you are dense.
---
&gt;Well then it sounds like you need to get some more people with gunning access.
---
Opinion brought to you by someone who has no idea how tedious, *poorly designed*, and critical a well maintained ACL is. 
---
&gt;adapt to survive
---
I'm afk on vacation, but I can't imagine this wasn't exactly what happened. As in, already done. Show me evidence otherwise that does not conflict with the point I brought up in paragraph 1
---
&gt;Seriously, how are highsec players to blame for this. 
---
Agreed. Not seeing a logical connection here either. But I, like I imagine many other goons, don't really care. Contrary to popular belief, we don't all hang on The Mittani's every word, but it's nice to have clear direction on what we're doing next. It doesn't really have to be logical. It just has to be fun in some way. Define that as you will.
---
Pretty much hit the nail on the head. 
---
"We want all the benefit, but without all of the work" 
---
"Make Sov Lazier Again, bring back passive moon mining"
---
as today it is page #6.
---
Define powerless, because I've never felt restricted in any way to do what I like doing.
---
drink the koolaid more why dont you, shit you would probably slit your wrists to if papa mittens told you to do so. never seen anything as delusional or brainwashed as this lol.
---
delete this
---
i watched the INN meta-show the other day, which was basically mittens repeating himself over and over and over again to the point of attempted brain washing, all the while an elected CSM (aeryth(sp?)) threatened to wage war on highsec and ccp, unwittingly delivering brilliant arguments for abolishing that silly institution altogether. calling the drifter invasion wow 20 times doesn't make it wow - it just shows what he's trying to do very clearly.
---
So to confirm, owning structures in an area of space -doesnt- aid you in defending that space is what you're saying? Doesn't help to stage fleets from? Doesn't help keep safe eyes in system? I'm confused.
---
You must be new here...
---
Both actually. Nullsec/lowsec missions are way more dangerous and pay more. It depends if it’s worth it based on how much you can guarantee safety from players.
---
Welcome back to Eve known space grath.
---
Nah they’re just griefers. Nothing more than your common playground bullies.  They convince new players that they must pay a “fee” to mine without being ganked.  
---
https://forums.eveonline.com/t/mining-should-require-more-skill/156451
---
This is legit what the think more or less straight from the horses mouth.  I’ve always been able to avoid them thankfully.  But they hang out in the new player channels lurking for victims.  You could speak up in the mining channel and have one of their trolls randomly assign a bounty in a specific amount which tells their people out that you were seen disparaging “Steve 420” or whoever.  
---
They’re trash.  Don’t belong in the game.  Let new people figure the game out without the harassment.
---
This makes me happy.
---
Big thank you! But are the NPCs actually harder to kill than in Highsec?
---
Probably not a bad idea.
---
Let me just attempt simplify nullsec's reaction:
---
"NPCs that are both unrewarding and tedious are not enjoyable."
---
Not hard to understand or empathize with. Except for many here it is. Enough of them are bombastic, mean spirited, claimed high sec players. This gives the null secs leadership an excuse and a target for thousands of people.
---
Well that is in fact good to know! I think this situation could still be resolved with a sig group dedicated to drifter defense while the rest of the alliance wages war, or with the use of jump clones. what do you think?
---
How would you suggest i add more, i do love some popcorn.
---
There is plenty of a sandbox. It keeps evolving and it introduces new threats. Some which may be hard to beat now. It also has amazing potential in the future where one side might use them to their advantage.
---
All I see right now is premature whinging that it's "hard" or "annoying". Guess what, some people consider what Goons do to them annoying as well with them being virtually impossible to attack nowadays. Casino's have been banned and thus no more flow of cash to trigger conflicts in the same way etc.
---
I mean, by your logic, to the majority of EVE Goons ARE drifters.
---
Your response is quite confusing to me? Are we talking about HighSec space, which in game/lore wise is supposed to be the safest yet we all know is the most dangerous, or Null Sec, the area that is lawless, and supposed to be dangerous lore-wise, but actually allows 10 rorq alts to peacefully mine without a care in the world?
---
I'm sorry that you find it "a chore" to own some of the most lucrative, yet lore-wise, most dangerous space in game? And large quantities at that.
---
What's that old EvE saying? "Don't undock what you can't afford to lose" I believe? Maybe in this case it should be "don't anchor what your aren't prepared to put the effort in to defend". Or I think more succinctly....HTFU.
---
REEEEEEEEEE
---
Ccplz grow some balls and make drifters hit rorqs that are in belts not just on gates
---
REEEEEEE
---
It depends how many systems the drifters occupy. i believe in delve is 10 atm, but it changes. So it is not possible to say we need this many people to hold down the fort, for it could be 3 now and 20 later. Random mechanics are random.
---
Flair matchs up, also link your loss mail
---
So you say.
---
Nah.
---
Please no regdate shaming.
---
FTFY:  If Gobbins agrees with mittens, Gobbins probably needs to lay of the ~~coolaid~~ cocaine, too.
---
We just ignoring it for now :P
---
&gt;You wouldn't expect people to reinvest the isk they make doing an activity into something that would let them make more isk?
---
You would, which is why people who make isk from industry set up more industry. If you can have infinite slots in one location, having 2 x infinite slots doesn't actually help much. Assuming the original build location was picked carefully, placing a second raitaru adds *nothing*.
---
&gt;or you know, docking up your blinged incursion ship so you can buy an even blingeyer abyssal ship
---
So you upgrade from a raitaru... to a raitaru? Anything bigger doesn't make much sense since they get targeted as easy killboard green. There's no extra bling to add that isn't assured to be destroyed.
---
Now how many people are in Imperium? Roughly 24,000 I think? Does it honestly require the entire super capital fleet and all 24,000 of those people to defend 10 systems or even 20 systems from a few drifter fleets? The drifters arent actually killing anything. at least according to mittens.
---
That's not what I... **sigh**... nvm.
---
Yes, you are. Your reply is to a statement about sovereignty. My reply was about sovereignty. I think maybe you are talking about occupation of space. I which case your alone in this topic's sub thread.
---
I'm sure that they make the best of their, shall we call it, "limited opportunities." Humans are quite resilient, after all.
---
&gt;What is that newbro that wants to explore null
---
&gt;ganked rorqual
---
Ok so first off, that.
---
Second, the same way you do it in the other area of 0.0 and below, Wormhole space. It's called:
---
#NULL-Security
---
If you don't expect risk, and you don't expect to die, you're frankly an idiot. 
---
As for small corps? There *are* no small corps in kspace null, because they don't have to worry about drifters, they have to worry about the fact that if someone so much as gets a sniff of them, they get 80 supers dropped on their heads. It is *impossible* for any small corp or other element to hold even a single sovereign system in the state of the game because of the blue donut and power blocs. 
---
A small corp deals with dangerous space being ***DANGEROUS*** the way everyone else does: They realize that risk is inherent, and play accordingly. 
---
Don't try to preach for the safety of the little guy when your playstyle is actively killing it off.
---
Wasn't there some massive REE post just like this the other day with some budget fireside recording linked as well?
---
Sure, but so do spaceships.
---
Dangerous space being suddenly dangerous? 
---
Who could have fucking guessed?
---
POS Code is being removed on sisi, so all the old shit can finally go.
---
Here's an example: you want us to be removed from the game, but you can't. You lack the power.
---
You have to keep in mind that people have lives, and at no time max numbers are around. 
---
If i would have to guess on a medium day 3k are probably logged on. Keep in mind for every drifter fleet you need to sacrifice a full 256 man fleet in t1 destroyers. Of course i am not implying 10 fleets are out at the same time but people come and go and fc's and gunners probably are humans (or bees) and need rest.
---
 This is equivalent to defending against large numbers of players as fatigue goes without the morale boost of small victories. Its wack a drifter i guess.
---
Because gunning rights allow you to pull rigs, so no this is still ccps fault.
---
Some groups still use Lokis (Inner Hell use Arty Lokis IIRC) and just volley people, Leshaks are nice in the C5 meta, but for C4 fights Zarms just counter them and we end up just bringing even more logi than usual...
---
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I never really did an armor fight in the full shak meta but I was there for the theorycrafting and it seems only a marginal improvement at best. Bring enough shaks, spool up on triage, whoevers dies first runs away as fast as they can. More killmails sure and it's a lot less of a slog but it seems like there's not much depth to it.
---
Live in the moment, enjoy yourself.
---
shitty reason to bully
---
Very true about the number of people being on, but, at least in my alliance almost every single fleet has been quelled with just station guns or 3 super carriers and 1 fax. How people are choosing to do things is up to them if they want to do 256 man corm fleet or just use supers. But to say the only strategy is 256 man corm fleet seems a bit crazy to me.
---
What the hell happened to proving conduits? did multiple lvl3 filaments and there are none to be found. I resubbed because CCP lied about concord in invasions and now I can't even get my fallback 20 minute pvp
---
For a battleship it’s pretty fast tbh...
---
The thing I don't understand is Goons are the ones that perfected AFK VNI ratting. What. The. Hell? Like, his fit is terribad.
---
So that's why the music was suddenly loud in there!
---
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Guards are still hella used and Armour Legions are still pretty decent, Hell, Krypted came at us a few days ago with Sacs.
---
People use Absolutions over Damnations
---
That's what PL revenants jump to
---
Tell me, how many structures have you defended from drifters?
---
You mean RUST server.
---
What? No I don't, I think you guys are an amazing community and have build a true Empire in Nullsec, which is awesome if you are into that gameplay.
---
I have great friends that are both in INIT. and in GSF, aswell as others in the other side of Sov-Null. I wouldn't want any of those people to be removed from the game 
---
idk wtf is wrong with you, most people just want ANY big power nerfed, or mechanics implemented that even the field of battle somewhat. Because you know, fighting people you have no chance of beating isn't fun. But I think that's about it.
---
And I'm not even amongst those, I just watch nullsec politics as a TV show (nowadays it's fucking boring).
---
There are some serious "grrr goons" heralds and some followers, but most people don't actually give a fuck vOv
---
B0PE
---
I think it's been that way for a long time with incursions. Every time I go through an incursion system, that annoying sound travels with me every where I dock unless I log off.
---
Which one of you gave mikal platinum? Now he's never going to shut up
---
Meh, who knows sometimes you gun sometimes you form, sometimes you super.Perhaps it depends on where you need to do things and with what. As for supers you maay want to use them if no large dread-bomb logged in.. or you may not. Or if people are bored perhaps a suicide fleet might relieve boredom for a while until you discover the drifters respawm.
---
As of yet much is unknown.
---
About 5 now, Its pretty simple honestly takes like 3 minutes per fleet with a few super carriers. Good practice learning how to use one since i am fairly new to owning mine.
---
Why no cheese in the crust rigs?
---
And why do you want it nerfed? Because you feel powerless.
---
Compared to other brawlers it isn't.  Typically you need to go ab for the fitting space to allow for neuts.
---
I am not hoping for misery.
---
I am hoping for a big fat "reboot button" to be hit.
---
Ay I fell for isk scam twice but I'm 10 years older now u ain't getting me!
---
A Fort, an Astra, a JB and a Jammer.
---
There might be an Athanor or two in system but if so I can't dock at them and I didn't really look too closely at the time.
---
Larger corps have the resources to help you learn to pvp and mostly replace every ship you’ll lose through SRP. They also have more people to find squads and stuff to really narrow down what you want to do. 
---
Smaller corps on the other hand are generally less structured so there’s a better chance to do small events off the cuff. They also can feel more like a community where you’ll learn everyone’s names and  such. 
---
There’s not a right answer - it’s just what you want out of eve
---
You've essentially asserted that, because someone has a benefit, it's okay if it also has an effectively unlimited amount of "anti-fun" associated with it.  
---
I'm point out that there's no reason we can't apply that logic to essentially anything.  High, low, null, doesn't matter.  If the existence of a benefit means it's okay to associate an incessantly tedious make-work task to it, why should *anything* beneficial be spared the same treatment?
---
&gt;"don't anchor what your aren't prepared to put the effort in to defend".
---
So if that's how you feel about it, surely you would be fine with highsec being subjected to the same mechanics, right? And would be first in line to tut-tut about how people shouldn't anchor what they're not about to defend?
---
&gt; Paragraphs also typically cease being a disheartening obstacle representing a wall of text around 3rd grade when children learn to read more quickly.
---
I like this, sadly, [not in the new graphical media generations.](https://youtu.be/ILQepXUhJ98)
---
Sounds good. I hope you can keep it up for the 20th structure. Or the 200th. Or the 20,000th.
---
I thought this current goon war was just to get people resubscribed on their side and playing to ensure majority goonswarm on the csm. Now that elections are over any excuse to go back home would be taken in a heart beat. These drifter fleets arnt a threat to anything so i don't really understand the exaggerated response of goon leadership unless they really are just trying to play a victim card while doing what they were going to do anyway.
---
My tinfoil theory anyway.
---
Not really, but at this point I'd say just try the game out and see what you think of it.
---
you sweet, sweet summer child..
---
&gt;i think they are supposed to create random windows of vulnerability that other alliances could use to attack. This helps shake up null sec by leaving back doors open and giving Panfam for example, a window to backdoor and attack imperium.
---
Hey PanFam guys, are you super-pumped about trekking to what is literally the furthest corner of the universe from your home to attack random structures that NPCs may or may not have reinforced?  
---
You're not just going to let this golden opportunity slip by unseized, are you?
---
I've seen Lux Kontos on KMs of players and I thought that was the DD?  Though I'll agree that the DD damage levels vs players are pretty much missing as I've seen dreads tank multiples without popping.
---
More like borg
---
Wow, you must be really fun at parties!
---
Spoken like a true gent! In my experience those that are truly skilled and excel are often the most modest I therefore slightly don't believe you :) (Said with kind intentions)
---
That's a cute idea that is assuming an awful lot of logic and coherence that CCP has never once demonstrated.
---
Before that I think we should destroy jita 4-4 first
---
I mean, we could volley anything with enough tornados, yes?
---
Yeah I have had a little look and been watching a few videos. It generally "looks" intimidating
---
I d
---
Still not as many bodies as my freezer
---
Be the 4% of people that stay not the 96 that leave
---
You dense motherfucker... 
---
Yes querns, you are totally right. Noone has ever been so right in the game's history. Well done buddy, you are truly special!
---
If it wasn't such a big deal, then why does Imperium feel the need to have over 1000 titans back home to defend against this possibility?
---
Darwinism
---
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Im in that video you know.... also happy cakeday!
---
I understand that trauma and emotional distress are difficult to handle. Give it time.
---
You should try it out. What else do you want out of it? It's like every other fleet fight in the game were you got your mainline ship being X with your assortment of other ships that compliment the team &amp; counter the enemy. Every pvp Corp I've seen has a different POV on how to adapt to the wh armor meta whether its booshers and devos or kitsunes and sniper legions so I don't see how there's lack of depth especially now since the Leshak does have it's counters(range,capacitor,spool up time,jams). Atleast now the FAX dies or you lose subs &amp; you don't need to have more of the DPS mainline ship than the other team to win as AFK have demonstrated.
---
It's been part of life since highschool, it would be weird not to launch it every so often.
---
If it's such a big deal, how is panfam supposed to afford sending out  a fleet to attack timers on the other end of the universe where goons now have 1000 titans to defend when they have the same invasions taking place in their own space?
---
They could warp in Lancers as opposed to full-blown Drifter BS's.  Like, a Lancer could suddenly warp in on a site someone's running and watch from a distance before closing the distance.  It could then scan the player ship which might trigger drone aggro, and if it takes aggro from drones it'll web and call for more drones or a BS to jump to it within a minute.  A player could avoid this from happening easily.
---
I for one welcome our new overlords.
---
I was thinking of setting up a jump service once called Delivereeeeeee. effort
---
Ahahaha
---
This would have been comical!
---
Thanks for the clarification. Is there a route that's slightly easier on the learning curve? The learning curve looks so steep I'd have to use cleats on my boots!
---
You ruined it 🙄
---
No
---
That's a helpful way of describing it! Do you think that you don't need to know everything in order to start playing so that new players can "play and learn" simultaneously over a graduated period both enjoying the experience of both learning and playing?
---
ok lol thanks for your input.
---
1) well, thats debatable, and its contextual.
---
2) okay sure.
---
3) Who says that they get to know in advance what we are flying? who gets to say that they get a chance to refit?
---
4) it was just a thought, it wasn't what I would push obv.
---
&gt;You beat a lesh fleet (on equal footing) with halo-implant HACs, I'll send you 5b. Ridiculous.
---
Again, twisting my words.
---
&gt;Putting the neuts aside, if you want to compare AB HACs (lol) against leshaks and say they can mitigate damage you better use the actual case at hand: not 90% webs, 95%+ webs. Not one web, but multiple. At least 1 TP, most likely more. 
---
Its not fair for you to pretend like you get to create a context where you're absolutely in charge.  Hacs have absurdly good resists, have a ADC module to survive to catch reps, and even under heavy webs/tp, they still mitigate SOME dps so you're not gunna get the full dps.
---
Its not fair for you to pretend like your fleet gets to be entirely designed to defeat a HAC setup, where my fleet couldn't take the same sort of precautions.
---
Why don't I bring tracking disruptors? Why don't I bring jams to jam the vindi? Why don't I bring a cloaky bomber wing to bomb your leshaks off the grid?
---
When you go "well, we will just hit 10 95% abysall webs, and bring a shitload of tps, etc" its not exactly a reasonable argument.

Please don’t kill me
---
Got an example of who isn't?
---
Love it when 25b fights happen over a &lt;1b astra. Eve is great.
---
Because It only takes like 10 alts or the use of jump clones to stay back and defend against drifters?
---
You made it halfway through, I pushed play, read who was speaking and closed it again...
---
get out of here with your savior complex
---
drifters aren't doing anything today judging from the killboard
---
My argument wasn't that it was overpowered, I said that the neut cap reduction bonus makes it OPPRESSIVE.
---
I don't find the hull itself overpowered, I said that having the full rack of neuts that are perma-run is oppressive and prevents people from taking advantage of the few weaknesses the leshaks does have.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kills/abyssalpvp/
---
some, but not much
---
So is it literally impossible for a swarm of smaller groups of smaller ships to team up and work together to bring down a capital ship?
---
bad case of grrr panfam bad panfam infection.
---
You realize other people harvest things too? If you take yourself out of a market people will fill that spot because there is profit to be made. You essentially just fuck yourself.
---
It would be a good strategy for each account to support the other if it was allowed so for instance if you had a profitable trading account with lots of healthy economic activity producing a profit then this could be used to fund your battle account with all the battle cruisers
---
What are the sanctions for pilots insulting other pilots ? A short ban ?
---
ITT: Guy who doesn't know what "Savior" means.
---
It's a superiority complex, grammar n00b.
---
Curious as to how zarms counter them? just sheer rep strength?
---
How do you deal with the neuts?  Counter neuts?
---
Shield Upgrades AND advanced weapon upgrades to 5 would be perfect. just use a 'squire' PG implant till you finish these two
---
I'm not
---
Seems like you have all the answers but you don’t even know the question. 
---
Those criticizing null’s response forget that we’re also fighting against uncertainty. And what’s the best way to deal with uncertainty? You’re seeing it. 
---
And as the attacks over the weekend showed, you need 20 *people* at any given time ready to drop everything and defend structures. You don’t give gunning rights to just anyone, you give them to trusted members. In any alliance those same trusted members would be the same ones prosecuting war.
---
If that becomes the meta, then all that has to happen is the triage fits a reactive hardener, and good exp/thermal resists, and you're leshaks won't break anything. (assuming armor)
---
Yeah 1 med neut on the Loki and you’re in a whole lot of trouble.
---
Damn, that's awfully low.
---
r/eve sure does love to whine about Goons..
---
Organizations, not individuals.
---
Maybe you could have asked all those supers and titans that didn't deploy and were still krabbing to shoulder some of the load. I'm sure after they were all called dumb idiots they would have been more than happy to help
---
You for sure don't need to know everything. you'll never know everything. Just don't get frustrated and you'll do fine
---
Yeah place is dead. Too bad, CCP fucked up again, who would have thought
---
Madlad spotted
---
I don’t think that situation can be used as an argument here. We literally had ~15 drifter fleets (i stopped counting after 10th) that simultaneously spawned in our home system and started reinforcing shit. Such massive attack, as you can see, is quite unusual, and we literally had no other option but to form corms, caps and try to save the situation.  It also didn’t help that we had 150+ man fleet somewhere else, so numbers in my fleet were relatively limited.
---
Thats how its been done in the past. It seems like this is something that once again people will have to adapt to or succumb to. Because it would be very easy to solve this situation if you would either do one of 2 things.
---
A: Have less structures.
---
B: Give more people gunning rights.
---
But instead people are choosing to embargo high sec like they had anything to do with this? Most of high sec is barren anyway since its mostly just mission runners.
---
I dont have all the answers. But I do have the answers to the delusional spin that mittens is trying to put on this to hide that imperium was just burnt as hell on grinding structures.
---
To be fair, we did knock out a huge amount of their potential workload for them. We're just nice guys like that.
---
So 10 people with jump clones can defend against it, but you're also claiming it's going to make goons vulnerable to attack by smaller organizations?  I mean... which is it?  You really can't have it both ways.
---
All that aside... Nobody, but *nobody*, is trekking from Geminate to Delve to shoot at some random structure merely because some NPCs knocked one timer off of it.  That idea is simply laughable.
---
Who uses Gas for Base Metals?
---
https://i.imgur.com/bnPnuu7.gif
---
Are you here for our females?
---
But highsec doesn't get the benefit of holding sov. They don't get the benefit of having 10 rorqs, 5 nyxs, and 20 nidds in each system, with a supercap umbrella for defensive and no non-blues for 20 jumps. I think this is what it comes down too. You are used to living with all this without paying the price for it, and now that you have to pay its price, you get salty.
---
BuT wHy NoT jUsT lEt EvErYoNe Be AbLe To PuLl rIgS
---
If you are an init member who didn't think they are a good pet, then you just checked your own boxes.
---
Wow, some random pubbie.
---
We did!
---
I'd wondered where they came from. Now I just wonder when they are going to go back there.
---
Having fewer structures doesn't stop the drifters. You can have a single structure, and the workload that the drifters create is still infinite.
---
I'll just call you a liar now and get it over with.
---
I'm happy to see fights happening. I'm running my own fleet mates in T1 frig smallgangs to get them used to losing ships and flying roles.
---
This is what it comes down to. Holding Sov. You're too lazy to hold sov, and honestly, just go to highsec if you think its such a wonderful place. Stop blaming highsec for this. They don't get the benefit of having 10 rorqs, 5 nyxs, and 20 nidds in each system, with a supercap umbrella for defense and no non-blues for 20 jumps. Not to mention the insane indy bonus you get as well. I think this is what it comes down too. You are used to living with all this without paying the price for it, and now that you have to pay its price, you get salty.
---
Low effort, needs paint
---
If it was a keep star it wouldn't be so laughable. It would be devastating actually if they got it to hull timer and then moved a fleet capable of killing it into range.
---
They very well could trek from Geminate to Delve.
---
Yes you really can have both. Otherwise goons wouldn't have called a 1000+ super capital fleet back to delve. That idea is laughable in and of itself. It doesn't take 1000+ titans to kill a drifter fleet. It takes like 3 super carriers tops to defend a region. Goons have far more than 3. 
---
You could also split up into two separate fleets?
---
How hard is it to split a 1000+ man titan fleet in half leaving half home to defend while the other half deploy. I mean TEST does it with 1/4th that number.
---
The local rage saved to my notes is the only thing that keeps me coming back once in awhile.
---
How considerate! Have an orange arrow for your effort :)
---
This version makes a lot more sense; which is to say next to none.
---
I'm only here because I logged into the wrong account, but I agree the Drifters should follow up and get structure kills, and loot is ok, but you have to be very careful about what/how many you put in that can.
---
Because we had fuck all for a super fleet at the time, to be specific. Don't worry, you'll understand when we come to evict you.
---
Yes! Tornado all the things!
---
I mean, Goons own Delve and rent out PB, how small are we supposed to get?
---
(And yes a few systems/constellations scattered about as well)
---
What if drifters took sov ?
---
Thank you for clearing that up. It looked as a weird situation and this sheds more light upon it.
---
 15 fleets is rough.
---
I miss the days when none of us really knew how to play this fucking game, instead of most of us.
---
Don't feel bad. At least you aren't married to my wife HOLY FUCK REEEEEEEE
---
Obligatory: https://youtu.be/y2GwrR-4Q9E
---
Looks like I have found the person who cannot read and his username is barwey.
---
You forgot to include Mittens bitching and complaining in the background.
---
Imagine my surprise, when we got a notification about cynojammer being hit by drifters, I logged in, pinged for a fleet, undocked and saw this shit on grid.

Could you do more than warp to random things and attack what is there? Maybe follow up on some timers? As an AI your definitely pointless. If your a learning AI it's time for another iteration.
---
Yeah, if you get into alliance organization/command etc, then there's a lot of time investment in keeping things running for people. If you're not Space Important, you can play things at your own pace.
---
I just signed up last night. Here's my initial take on it.
---
If you're coming in expecting something like WoW where you're the hero amongst a world of heroes, this isn't it. There is no chosen one with magic crystals or some other BS. It's a game with a very steep learning curve that will take a lot of time to get used to.
---
However, so far, the majority of people I've encountered in game (very few so far) and on Reddit seem very willing to share the experience with you. I'm very impressed by the community as a whole so far. 
---
I'm just in this for some relatively quiet down time and this game seems to be one that will allow it to some degree. So go ahead and hop on the trial and give it a go.
---
CODE has a lot of goon alts in it and often partner up with them for gank ops. They're not "just an alt corp", but they allow people's suicide gank alts. I know lots of ppl with alts in CODE, more of them than not are goons.
---
Point 2 is stupid, there’s still 2 more timers after the shield timer, and timezone tanking still exists
---
Yeah. Usually either them or PL I hear.
---
I think both of you gentlemen are clearly mistaken and mean Terraria.
---
No one was causing structure risk through PvP?
---
\*looks at the list of structures in his KM list from the last three weeks\*
---
Man, you fooled me. I could have sworn we were having a war, killing structures, via PvP.
---
https://www.rpsgame.org/ same thing but more fun.
---
Terrible, terrible disease
---
Join a Corp with tons of people on comms. If they don't get on comms, leave.  Buy a headset microphone. They are only $20.
---
Of you're on comms you will always have available:
---
People that can answer your questions about everything.
---
People that are actively searching for targets and will more often than not ask for your help to kill them.  They are literally generating content for you.
---
Faster response to hostiles. Do you realize that damage is measured in damage per second!  That means that every second counts!  You just can't get help on grid fast enough by communicating via chat.  You need to be on comms to execute those smash and grab operations.
---
No it's not. There is now a force of attrophy that must be dealt with. The reaction from you all is clear indication that this is the right thing to do.
---
&gt;If it was a keep star it wouldn't be so laughable. It would be devastating actually if they got it to hull timer and then moved a fleet capable of killing it into range.
---
&gt;They very well could trek from Geminate to Delve.
---
So in this self-indulgent fantasy of yours, I take it the entire population of Goons has gone on vacation at the same time?
---
&gt; It takes like 3 super carriers tops to defend a region. Goons have far more than 3.
---
​Then there's no chance of the drifters rendering them vulnerable, as you've suggested. 
---
Your position is simply inconsistent, simultaneously claiming that it's trivial to defend against, yet could definitely-for-sure render the strongest entity in the game vulnerable.
---
Horde is using corms... A lot of corms.
---
Doesn't take a ton of cap building to get the cost index that high.
---
Well, in his defense, PL does have pathogen (or something similar) as alliance logo =D
---
Forgetting to include Mittens is perfectly fine.
---
It's not inconsistent at all. You just can't wrap your head around it for some reason because I'm sure you are drinking mittens koolaid. Bull I'll try to explain it again.
---
The drifters are not a serious threat to killing a structure. Check.
---
If left unchecked they will create timers. Check.
---
Timers are vulnerabilities that if left unchecked would allow another alliance to take advantage of them. Check.
---
I see no inconsistencies here. This whole narrative by goons is just a huge delusional spin made by mittens to hide how burnt imperium was on grinding structures.
---
I notice that eve IPH estimates tend to always be like 10% higher than the actual cost of the materials when I throw up the multi-buy in jita. When I use CCP data instead of eve-marketer it seems to be more accurate but still off; could be both caches are using some kind of averaging to stop weird spikes or one offs from messing up the math?
