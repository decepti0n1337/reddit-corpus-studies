I DED site run and run relic sites. I am kinda newbie so I'm saving up for an alt. I find DED sites fun but I also pvp a decent amount (I'm partial to solo SB though).

so 10 fleets per day? How is that possible?

Oy vey, somebody might have different opinions than me?! Commence the witch-hunt and and alert the multicult inquisition!

Nice try snuff, you weren't cynoing your JF in a buzzard. But yeah you can fit an Indy cyno to a Venture now afaik so that's a cheap alternative.
---
I personally think there needs to be a fundamental change in EVE PvE, and I've seriousposted about it [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/dirghw/whats_your_dream_vegas_announcement/f3y7pl6/?context=3).
---
low class wormholer who has probably never lit a cyno in his life writes essay on cyno changes
---
Not sure what you're suggesting, I don't see anywhere a spot where I suggested they would let others outside of the alliance use their Ansiblexes. It supports \*them\* using it - i.e. those who don't or can't have an ansiblex (i.e. lowseccers) are "unwilling collateral damage"
---
1. be bad at pvp
---
2. kink shame in local

3. pimp out hordes of nonbinary fedos through Delve

4. i'm an addict

You cannot gate capitals out of lowsec islands.
---
&gt; like PvE Titans going around Boson'ing an entire fleet of rats to death in one shot
---

---
That's fixed by the boson sig nerf, not the recon change. Titans who boson rat do so in their home system without having to jump anywhere. Titans who set up boson traps on gates jump to beacons.
---
&gt; Use a BlOps to deploy a fleet of Recons to take out the Cyno jammer. Then light a Cyno and bring in the big boys.
---
Fantasy, nobody does this.
---
Ehm, that is litterally what i was told. The corp leader (i think) said it is most likely someone who got evicted and is really mad at them. On their discord server i didnt find any hint of anything political or anything hinting in that direction.
---
Someone doesn't like nazis? Must be a Jew!
---
And here I was thinking that r/Eve is any different from the rest of this stupid site.
---
It's not that people are acting like it has to die, it's that the statistics say they do. It's a fact, not an assertion.
---
Probably has probes in his ships tho, maybe even the depot and a launcher to use them

---
Unfortunately for you the math doesn't check out. The current, "unenhanced" skilling spree rewards a minimum of 10k SP per day which just so happens to be almost the same SP you get from a set of +5s (10.8k per day). Coincidence?
---
To fit your login streak model we'd have to nerf the skilling spree reward system. Alternatively we could boost the rewards, but streak based reward incentives are really fucking annoying. That's the kind of coercive cheese, gacha crap I'd expect from a mobile game like Eve Echoes. "Log in daily to receive your free nuAurum and spend 20 nuAurum for a spin on the wheel of SP!"
---
Fuck both of them, mittens should have been banned too.

---
Yes we need to fix attributes and IMHO by extention training implants. I think they should switch them with a cerebral accelerator probably take 5 implants for 5 slots into 4 total accelerators like plus 3s and plus 5s with extendeds... Only issue remains is pirate implants and people don't use them for training soo we can arguably just remove it from them..
---
I know you can just jc in a citidel to get in and out of a training clone but that's not conducive to nomading or even living in two different places such as hs and wormhole space.. Never mind when you fucking forget to jump out of your training clone.. I can't tell you how many times I've done that.. It honestly feels like every time I buy a set the next fucking day they're gone because I forgot to jc out of it.. Never mind attribues aren't.. Apparent to newbros.ive heard or people making new characters just to redo attributes..
---
Tristan's are OP man.
---
Well that is super disappointing :(
---
&gt; I'm hoping that they just thought the discription on that racist site was something they stumbled across and copy/pasted rather than endorsing anything else on there.
---
That's pretty much according to the ceo what happend. They just wanted to use the blonde big boob theme with matching naming pattern. I think OP could at least just have talked to them and asked before saying they're nazis.
---
You got double pap for logi and they were per toon instead of player. But there were like 5 fleets a day maybe.
---
In the character sheet under the decorations tab, what is the permissions tab for? There's a save button and a 'set all' button at the bottom?
---
&gt;1) What do you guys do with your time in EvE? 
---
I pick a spaceship that looks cool, or does something that looks fun and i just dick around with it.
---
&gt;2) What do you do for fun?
---
not entirely sure how this is different from the first question, if i'm not having fun i just log out and play a game that is fun.
---
3) What do you do to earn ISK
---
literally nothing, I've got to the point where i don't really need the isk to buy  new shit any more and i pay my sub with cash instead of isk.
---
actually that's kind of a lie, i do some PI  on my alts because i kinda like PI but now every scrubtier skill point farmer has PI skills on their farming characters the prices aren't so great any more, relative to the plex costs of keeping an account subbed.
---
4) Why do you do it?

cos eve is full of shit you can half ass/afk which is really nice when i just wanna chill out and relax.

If you can open and close the chat easily like leaving and reentering fleet then it will fix it.
---
because the fozzie system actually allows faster, more subcap focused gameplay. And personally, without much lag, I love (and I know alot feel the same) contested fozzie sov combat.
---
I think generally it's in a quite good place nowadays. Except maybe, make uncontested timers faster (fewer nodes in total)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The problem about the "empire building" which led to stagnation, is caused by an abundance of resources. This is only indirectly connected with fozziesov. You could easily scale that down, without changing the fundaments of fozzie sov
---
u make custom PP vid, yes?  how much isk?

no....problem....

I would guess reddid shitposter will describe well the profession for a lot of EvE players.

Yeah? Why wouldn’t we be joking around. We all had fun last night.

There are players acting like bots, but what he described absolutely were bots. I stumble over them regularly. Guys like you often show that they are not bots by writing frindly insults to local chat like "fuked up bitter vets". Thats how I distinguish guys like you from bots ...

Aurora has a +80% optimal and -75% tracking. Radio only has +60%

strange, radio for my assault frigs and my avatar with HAW guns shoots further than aurora...

You can jump to it.

Probably more of how that would line his pockets by being "down to earth weeb like the rest of you scrubs"

I'd definitely wager you're mistaken, but bear in mind that HAW guns use Scorch XL not Aurora

Downvoted for sarcasm? For shame.

If the Red Donut collapses, many alliances in the Blue Donut will just reset eachother.

lol. that is definatly true, maybe i mean anti cap guns.... rip... will have to look again when i log in at home.

but i swear radio has the tracking and range advantage....
---
Vs Scorch it definitely does, but Vs aurora it only has a tracking bonus.

Then I don't know

If everyone do like you, rat/mine all the day, ofc no one will ever defend your own space, that safely pocket you money in, you need to earn it, they come from a WH ? Roll it, there is home defence ? Organize it. don't stay dock waiting the guys to clean the space for you
---
It was an experience. I will say
---
It's because the Rorqual has the firepower of a carrier and the tank of a FAUX.
---
In contrast, blops are expensive glass cannons that can barely survive a cool breeze so much as contemplating wafting in their general direction. Nobody with any combat capabilities on grid is worried about a blops being dropped on them.
---
of course they min/max the ships. What does that change it's clear strength against large HP ships, and it's (relative) weakness against low HP ships.
---
But about the Pseudo-WoW players, I don't get what you mean, please explain
---
Fun fact, many years ago you could tank concord. Then CCP increased their damage and ewar capabilities and put that tanking concord is an exploit.
---
Capsuleers are basically just really rich citizens that paid a fuckton of money to be immortal with the whole clones thing.  Imagine if you had near unlimited money, how much military power could you REALLY buy?  as many random guns and rocket launchers as you could buy, maybe even a tank or twenty, unlimited money doesn't get you access to current-gen U.S aircraft carriers.  In a full on fight if all the worlds governments pooled their resources into a world police, no citizen army would be able to put a scratch on it.
---
That's basically what happened here.
---
It was my sarcastic response to your dumb suggestion lol.
---
Ghost sites.
---
I'm not implying that what gigx said wasn't Bad, but if one's got unbanned for saying stupid things that he didn't meant, the other one that actually did the same thing should have been unbanned too. But yeah, not everyone is leading a 40k coalition i guess
---

Enjoy the doughnut.

He's been preparing for the korean market for years.  
---
It all makes sense now.
---
way to make a man cry before coffee
---
&gt; if you enter concord space in a ship with a security status below -5 then you will go criminal and concord will kill you. (in other areas you are only chased by faction navies)
---
correction, with -5 to -2 sec status you are flagged as a legal target to other capsuleers and will be chased by faction police (not faction navy or concord) in systems above a security threshold according to your sec status. you can transit through these systems and are not required to lose your ship.
---
if you go criminal in lowsec (aggress a pod) and jump into highsec with the criminal timer running though, you'll get concorded regardless of your sec status.
---
Not 100% sure of this, but I think that CONCORD exist solely to protect the empires from Capsuleers, just in case we decide to take it alll for ourselves.
---
plus freaking one
---
If only we had the technology to know when 2 weeks have gone by, or knew how long a week was, we wouldnt need to guess when the next talos release would be.
---
yeah if you are a normie i guess
---
Although I think it was suicide, I'll play devil's advocate for the conspiracy theorists: If Epstien *was* killed, then it was to protect other people who engaged in criminal activity, and those people are still walking around today, possibly continuing the same criminal activity.
---
I have considered it.... but I guess I'll just be a shit tier tackler like I have always been.  Maybe you can teach me how to tackle?
---
Oh I have no doubt it will never happen, I was really just asking how they justify it never happening from a lore standpoint.
---
Shut up CCP sympathizer moron
---
Let me be more specific - is there a reason why they have managed to keep the tech to themselves that grants the command line access to our brains?
---
rm -r /home/capsule/capsuleer/brain/
---
Did you know that salmon find their home waters by sense of smell, which is even more keen than that of a dog or a bear?
---
That kinda makes sense I guess. I do however really think that anyone loosing a war would stop making payments to prevent a future war that might happen pretty sharpish.
---
Yes please, I'd like to purchase a timekeeping device.
---
`rm -rf --no-preserve-root /`
---
basically capsuleers don't have root access ;)
---
Well, we had the banners for the forums ( [http://desusig.crumplecorn.com/](http://desusig.crumplecorn.com/) ) and now we have the girl spaceships.

Kawaaaaiiiiiiiiiiii Online ?

Trying to cloak in the system where concord holds sov.
---
This is a game where you can never learn everything, that's why it's so great!
---
That's honestly pretty lame. I get it was an easy solution to make them gods, but imagine the lore that could have formed if players could still completely halt trade hubs.
---
Has there been any tries to run corp/alliance communist style where everything is owned by everyone?
---
Thanks!
---
Interestingly this limits normal capsuleer brain function to in-game activities, and it mostly stops functioning outside the game. Which explains why all our posts on /r/Eve read as if they are written by somebody with severe brain damage.

RIP eve.

It's nice to see when snuff and galmil blobbed calmil out of existence and the warzone combat plumetted

political fallout, possibly. if it's not in the Yulai convention and they attempt it, imagine the uproar from the empires

Not...exactly, they have a wasting sickness caused by their rampant use of cloning for reproduction and possibly some other things/sabotage as well. We heard briefly from a jove who figured he was probably the last or one of the last.

i mean, luminaire is home to both gallente and caldari, so gallente can't possibly be occupants in their own home system. you could say they are occupants in the planet caldari prime, but that's not exactly the same thing. besides, that one is now mostly administered by ishukone after five years under state control.

Is a 2003 toon with nice name, primarly subcaps. I am in a multiple trade operation, and want know the aprox value of this char. The character baaar forum dont give me an estimate yet
---
I'd really like to see CONCORD lose their invincibility, but still be extremely powerful in other ways.
---
My first thought was for CONCORD to have very powerful modules (similar to officer modules) equipped to their ships with exceedingly low drop rates, and when a CONCORD ship is engaged, for them to continually escalate by bringing more ships at an exponentially-growing rate until the offending ship(s) are destroyed. Also thought it would be good for the modules to take up a ton of cargo space when they do drop (no instawarp frigate haulers), and be extremely illegal in highsec and lowsec, causing any ship carrying them to be engaged by gate guns and any gate-guarding NPCs (including CONCORD). The end result is that the modules would be very powerful, but also very expensive and rare. Something like that could allow player groups to engage CONCORD in sizeable fights, pushing the capsuleers vs empire lore a bit further.
---
Interesting how the two sides of a conflict spike together. You'd think the winning side would fall and the losing rise.
---
The Jove of the Third Jove empire are gone, what is left of them have left the New Eden cluster altogether. Technically the Sleepers and Drifters are a different kind of Jove and are still around.
---
&gt; the fuck, i thought this was patched like 9 months ago
---
It was.
---
😂 those are the people Who’s sites I’ve stolen. Just stole about 8-14bil in isk from Rainbow knights krab holw. Which looks to be a Lazerhawks krab hole considering one of Them always shows up on Orange pyes zkills. 
---
Now I think I’m in Braxis’s KRAB hole. Considering there’s tons of ties to HK. 
---
If you’re interested in knowing where all the major wormholer groups krab holes are. I know where they are. They’ve been colluding together for region 25 supremacy. All wormhole sites are shared amongst the region sooo if you get enough Major corps farming that region then they actually have an infinite amount of sites and more isk.
---
I figured it out when I was in MCAV and pushed people to take krab holes in area 25 along with all the other major corps.
---
Región 25. Pulsars and Red giants. 100% chance of farming lazerhawks and HK tears.
---
open the map im REALLY new

This song is also too gay btw.

Thats why its such a good song. ;))

The sites have really terrible spawns for PVEing compared with C5’s and C6’s.
---
&gt;Banderlogs
---
Anything for content.. right..
---
They didn't die from the event, it's more like the jove have been on the decline for a very long time and (from what we can presume) the last members have emigrated somewhere else. The sickness didn't exactly kill them, it made them suicidal, lose interest in reproduction, etc. At this time, all involvement the Jove had with the 4 empires and concord has been delegated to the Society of Conscious Thought.
---
Burn Jita is pretty funny like that, you end up with GIANT blobs of CONCORD and faction police roaming around since they keep getting spawned, but they all respond to the next criminal incident, so it's still possible to get them off a grid for you to gank on it.  Otherwise the system would just be wall-to-wall CONCORD all weekend lol
---
But they still had to batphone in outside groups... That's the whole point...
---
&gt;lots of us BORED in INIT
---
Might I suggest leaving then?  Plenty of content when you aren't in a null blob

Caldari small gang and solo guys used to trash the gal mil guys. Gals only had numbers advantage to blob out systems. Individual fighting Cals were always better in most situations..
---
Ah so similar to the C1's, are C1-C3 considered a lower class althogether?
---
CATCH...ME IF YOU CAN
---
"Low class" is generally used to mean C1-C4, i.e. non-capital holes.
---
C4-C1 are really considered low class. C4 are lovingly also referred to as “wormhole middle class”.
---
I could see all of the sites from C1-C4 paying out more and having rat spawns reworked. Right now it’s only worth being in WHs for your farming C5 and above (in my illustrious opinion). Much easier ISK to be made in null blocs otherwise.
---
Thankfully wormholes are sexy enough for people to stay for other reasons :)
---
&gt;It is fundamental  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;and unless CCP changes the way SOV works it isn't going to change 
---
Hmmm
---
OK Magni
---
It's mostly a meme that C5 corps particularly enjoy. Yes, C4 sites are terrible - but you don't rat in your home anyway, and C4s have two statics so if you choose your C4 appropriately you can rat or PVP through whichever class you want.
---
If it's an issue use or sell them, why would you need to hoard hundreds of bpc's?
---
Fair enough, I used to live in C4 but we didn't have any caps lol
---
It's a funny meme.
---
But let's not pretend that the entirety of nullsec isn't krabbing, often on multiple characters while mostly AFK, and that there aren't far more of those.
---
In most cases there was no need for a batphone, we generally had fairly even fights going and were enjoying ourselves before snuff showed up and denied everyone content.
---
/r/evejobs
---
No. Most do not. The vast majority just dock up, log off, and then log into one of their own quintuple boxing nestor account groups

It depends on what aspect of the game you enjoy. Generally speaking look for a corp with more than 3 people in it (unless that's your thing) and says they do the activities you are interested in. Most corps have a public channel to ask questions in before you join them that should help you get the scope of what they do.
---
So it's someone sitting in the metaphorical shattered glass house who didn't learn from the experience and continues to throw stones?
---
Thank you for the info. 
---
Is having Dread/Carrier on the same alt ok?
---
I'm honestly not sure why the drifter wormholes are so underused, thry lead almost ANYWHERE. With some skill and a little common sense, it's only marginally more dangerous than normal wormholes
---
Hence being a meme fit.
---
This is a very interesting request, but I cannot promise anything, that we find time / a good solution to fix it. Still, if this ever happens again to some extent: Could you please send a bug report from the client (F12 - Report Bug) after this happened, so that I have some data to go with and mention my name in the title of the bug report?
---
While we are at this topic, there is unfortunately one area with bookmarks, where we could not fix short client freezes yet, and this is if you have too many bookmarks in the same system and have them enabled on sensor overlay. I will look further into this after the release.
---
Depends on what's in the chain. J-Space PVP is more fun than K-Space. Best ISK that I can make without putting in the time and effort to take and set up a farm hole, plex the relevant accounts is ratting with my corp, huffing gas, and running reactions.

Moros -&gt; Nag -&gt; Rev -&gt; Phoenix. In bigger fights where dreads are actually killing each other those Phoenix are gonna lose a lot of damage in missile travel time onto dead dreads while being just as tanky as the instant application Revs
