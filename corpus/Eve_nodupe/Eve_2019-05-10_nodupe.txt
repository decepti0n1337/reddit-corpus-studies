Sorry, tapi also sold out to the Chinese.

Inb4 botted reports.
---
This thread is getting better and better. Anyone else noticed that strong smell of salt in the air tonight? :D
---
Oh spare me your damage control. Sort you and by extension DARKNESS as a whole are **doxxing advocates** and have been for awhile.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You harboured members of Kenshin leadership after they doxxed someone for stealing assets and even allowed one to rejoin after kicking him for PR.
---
You knowingly doxxed someone by failing to censor the return to address on a mail package you received.
---
I don't buy for a second that you deleted the ping after you realised "someones irl name was actually his irl name" if you deleted it all, you deleted it solely for damage control purposes to hide your complete, 100% support for doxxing in this game.
---
Darkness members, your leader has shown his true colours. Will you continue to support someone who has unapologetically doxxed people not one, not twice, but three times and will likely continue to do so for as long as he isn't banned?
---
I expect his eternal hate boner for Goons will be pretty much unaffected by troublesome things like data and facts.
---
it's true, but also false. 
---
 I would say Chinese people living in mainland more likely acknowledge Chinese as the nationality rather than the ethnic. 
---
but apparently, there is no "race" concept involved.
---
I think you replied to the wrong guy.
---
I’m in goons and no one ever told me that was the policy.
---
Well, it's not racist if it's true...
---
Yeah, if you re alright being the mindless, voiceless bot for someone else who gives a shit about you it might be fine. Tried it, not my cup of tea.
---
Way back when the whole Kenshin fiasco happened, one of the first things I said was that Sort Dragon's failure to properly act upon this hideous action was Sort Dragon an official declaration that he and by extention Darkness fully support and advocate for doxxing.
---
Thanks for proving me right once again Sort.
---
Just being the best shit tier pilot in exodus. It be like that sometimes
---
That's tricky
---
This made me laugh.  Thanks for posting.
---
...and BOT is un ironically a pretty good name for the group.
---
Ha! i am soo vindicated after this [https://twitter.com/CCP\_Peligro/status/1126496159407792128](https://twitter.com/CCP_Peligro/status/1126496159407792128)
---
Yeah ya do, your alliance is filled with them
---
It's more like the story where absolutely nothing happened in Armenia and the Turkish were never involved in any genocide whatsoever. 
---
Also the only German - that I know of - getting publicly upset about Holocaust memorials is a right wing politician who afterwards got one huge memorial placed in front of his house by some activists. This got him really upset. 
---
Also bringing up any critique about memorials or raising the question if living family of Holocaust victims should still get a monthly paycheck as reparation will get you shunned publicly and basically brand you as an anti Semite forever. 
---
So I agree with you that's a terrible reference.
---
Agreed
---
None of you guys own stock or shit in a bag from CCP?Color me shocked.
---
(Then again the players would buy CCP if we could to get them to quit doing the same stupid shit over and over again wouldn't we)
---
Ishkur has a gimmicky neut fit that I love to death. Kitey Astero is a dream to fly with its agility.
---
Blap hecate/catalyst/eris always catching people off-guard somehow.
---
Ashimmu. It's a terrible piece of crap, but people tend to forget what its good points are. Plus it's cheap. Pilgrim is likewise considered bad but the 800 platerep fit suits me just fine.
---
I don't fly much of battlecruisers, but I swear one day I'll pull out the 500mn prophecy.
---
Torpedo battleships, especially the Typhoon. Hyperspatial armageddon is also pog.
---
Fun is a brain disorder,like autism.
---
When did he dox someone?
---
I don’t think the doxx was intentional, I hold no ill will.
---
What about calling the spreadsheet "Holocaust victims" then? The thing that makes it inappropriate is that a lot of people died, not why they died.
---
Goonswarm in addition to changing names etc has largest actual members by far. The chart is done in percentages, so their bots by percent won't show up close enough to the top. If CCP posted a chart by actual numbers from last 2 years, it'd be a different story.
---
Confirmed.  Was in SLYCE at wicked creek with TEST as our neighbor. Fun people to hang out.  Big disappointment when we join gotg.
---
Plz tell me they're joining goons. That would be great
---
K
---
Glad to see the isk shower tradition is still living on, you cute little newbee.
---
that was a direct reference to gold farmers in the original version of WOW, the chinese gold farmers dominated the raw materials market with the exception of fish because none of them could figure out how to "mine for fish" and most players wouldn't tell them because they knew they were gold farmers.
---
Anime is cartoons  
---
Delve is for goons
---
It's a goddam travesty
---
From what I gather the spreadsheet requested those listed to contact someone named after an event which mentioning can get Chinese people in trouble and is censored by their government?
---
So you accuse someone of botting, then have them contact someone where the record could potentially get them in real life trouble with their government who we all know don't treat dissidents very nicely.
---
That seems like an action designed to harm people based on their nationality to me, aka racism.
---
No camera can handle that.
---
Your not allowed to post on Reddit zekrab
---
&gt;Look at the population of Branch, its ratting numbers are  like \~half of that of Delve.
---
that was actually called out multiple times after the last MER release people noticed that they have a fraction of the people living in delve living in branch yet they managed to make half as much money as delve.
---
I simply think this is a chance for Slyce to live in a better place. The north is now full of shit and there's no reason to be in GOTG anymore, specially with Sort. I also hope that fuck doesn't get reelected. Hell, he should be banned.
---
If you ever mention February 30 2345 again where definitely no bad thing happened and it was a sunny day where everyone was happy mention again, I'll send you, your family and the 3 generations coming after you to a very nice facility where you learn to love the great fuhrer again!
---
Seriously, all I can think is “... it’s more racist to deny/ignore it, if anything.” 
---
Human rights abuses have no place being covered up in modern society for any reason. I cannot think of any good reason to say that a human rights issue should be ignored, downplayed, or otherwise - and to suggest otherwise would be either saying you don’t care about human rights, you don’t care because it isn’t you, or you don’t care because you don’t care about that group of people. Either viewpoint is disgusting
---
*14.4b error
---
Racist for siding with the Chinese people over their communist party? Moron...
---
Tbh if Rick folded alliance, and created megacorp and joined any alliance that would be kewl.
---
Yeah the drama is drama, whatever, but the doxxing is over the line. Swing a banhammer at Sort for that.
---
This post is racist
---
Molemolemolemole.
---
Have an up vote. Vertically integrating your production chain as described above can cut down buy/sell expenses substantially.  This matters a lot as there is often 3% or less profit on most items to produce.
---
I sit corrected. :D
---
I always felt Zeus was portrayed as some puny little wizard until they made the arcana. Even then he should’ve been just BIGGER.
---
I mean who isn't?
---
I too would like a link.
---
I think you need to pop some Ritalin and read what you just posted, because its pretty stupid.
---
The renters become the rentees, and then get fucked down the road.
---
it was a characters name, you can relax: no one was harmed in the creation of the character
---
No, you don't. You have to deal with ones even more retarded, such as yourself.
---
Pwned
---
Once in Fade we blapped a vexor doing belt ratting, and the guy resulted to be a newbro. He talked with us a little bit in local about how he felt when 70 dudes jumped on him and thanked us for the experience. Our FC told us to send him some money and I'm pretty sure that guy got like a billion from us. He looked very happy after that.
---
So I can call a character racial slurs then?
---
That ones my fav
---
RMT
---
&gt;This ~~post~~ rod is ~~racist~~ carbon
---
FTFY
---
I doubt SD remembers when was the last time he felt "its just a game" about Eve.
---
Goons get so much hate. Ironically I found they have some of the nicest people in the game.
---
Anytime Hilmar opens his mouth, you know a shit-tier idea is going to spew out.
---
i was using hot keys but thanks mate ;p
---
Exactly.
---
Only this time there's actual proof and he did it publicly so there's no need to wonder what actually happened.
---
&gt;Sort dragon kicks another alliance for more renting space
---
He needed the money to pay off next Alliance try to invade their space
---
It seems more like a PR thing, which seems to be driving a lot of their decisions recently (hello deadlines for PA buyout approaching...).
---
The new transparency is good, if it lasts, but the sheer number of bot bans are so low and infrequent that they aren't even going to put a small dent in the problem.
---
To clarify that: Thats how I felt after receiving nothing but harsh( and imo very questionable) orders, odd and excessive demands and rude STFUs from alliance-levels. To a degree where even my corp and all the other good line-member-folks I knew around there couldnt outweight it.  
---
I usually enjoy the paramilitary gaming-style in some EVE-organizations, but some ppl seem to forget that we re NOT actually in some military in EVE and behaving like some drill-seargent all day loses its charm pretty quick. Well, I m sad losing the ppl I used to play and chat with, but am happy to be out of the organization I played in, if that makes sense. vOv
---
We all wondered when you'd chime in on the new report that shows goonswarm itself doesn't even appear and the rental group we run is a much smaller offender than literally all the other renters.
---
I mean, you have FRT on one side, and now PLA/Mango on the other, so I guess you’d have to go to lowsec/J space to find someone not blue or bluetral with China
---
I'm curious if you are this misguided in real life too
---
there's a difference between talking about a historical event and racial slurs
---
for instance, tiananmen square reminds me of the heroic people who stood up to terrible people like tank man, not the atrocities of the chinese government
---
racial slurs make people read bigoted views, and if they're part of the group being targeted might feel harmed
---
I don't think he intentionally did it.
---
I agree with the rest of the sentiments that highlighting a human rights cause, a few days before the anniversary, is not racist but much needed attention. 
---
Some years back when I went to Beijing, I was just shocked with how many educated young adults didn't know about it. I'm not going to apologize for educating the people I talked to, nor am I going to apologize for bringing attention to it days before the anniversary.
---
Where does the Doxxing occur?
---
1) Industry structures have better bonuses in lower security space (high &lt; low &lt; null). Your blueprints are at risk while being actively researched, but safe if you can finish/cancel the job before the structure is blown up.
---
2) Don't do this, POS industry slower and less efficiency, your items are at more risk, and they're due to be phased out. I'm not even sure if you can use them now.
---
3, 3.1, 4) For further details: https://english.eve-guides.fr/index.php?article=132#Fitting.
---
Is he talking about human right issues? Or is he making it into a funny character name?
---
This is the equivalent of somebody naming his character "Gassed Jew" and going after German botters. It's not some social justice stance, it's just a somewhat tasteless joke.
---
Bingo!
---
Still a better CSM candidate than Anveri
---
Only sigs are visible, not anoms. 
---
I personally don’t really care much either way, although it will make exploration easier, especially if ignored sigs get ignored on this list. If not it will be somehow easier but also more annoying
---
All alliances have bots, but groups from certain regions of the world are heavily known for certain things.
---
Like the Chinese and botting/hive mind like mentality to work together and dismantle everything you hold dear if you arent chinese. The Brazilians for standing in the fire and complaining about the healer, right now the Venezuelans for farming gold.
---
Took Peligros numbers and broke down what coalitions each one was in. 
---
As Peligro said in his tweet, "BEING ON THIS LIST DOESN'T MEAN YOUR ALLIANCE IS FILLED WITH BOTS NOW". I just thought it would be interesting to break it down at this level.
---
Nice
---
Apparently my fellow TESTbro is slow on the uptake. I think we’ve all known Sort is a dumb fuck for a long time
---
the video is there to watch, it requires more piloting because if you let the enemy line up a shot there is a chance you get blapped but that's true for pretty much every frigate anyway unless you have an adc.
---
Doubt it. You can’t safe up every time an explorer or DED runner runs a site and it respawns. I mean, you can, but you’d spend more time docked than ratting/mining
---
Hold the fuck up, the only people I know who get upset about Holocaust memorials are fucking literal Nazi's who want to cover up what Hitler did.
---
ARE YOU SAYING SORT IS SIDING WITH NAZI'S?!
---
Would be interesting to see percentage vs lifespan of alliance. Lots of discussion of that here - a few having a high ban : age ratio.
---
To be fair, a certain SLYCE Corp saw this coming. They jumped ship a few weeks ago and joined us. Our gain, Sort’s loss. These guys are great.
---
You should chop it up and make some guacomolie
---
Did you say Drake? Just 70 mil a pop and with insurance even less. Can kill a c3 combat site in 20min
---
Yeah but the way “we”are using Tiananmen Square here isn’t to remember an atrocity or highlight the heroes. It’s to flag Chinese botters.
---
Newbs can do sites from the exploration agents.
---
Is it possible to do Agency or other PVE stuff with a friend or two? If we're in different starter systems do we just jump to each other and play?
---
Delve or nothing. Will happen within an hour of being there
---
Why the hell did you stay with that sapient tumor for that long?
---
They tried that with trig sites. You know what raters do? Make the ship tank the worst case.
---
So you're here to kick ass?
---
Don’t you mean not with slyce anymore?
---
So he definitely kicked Slyce to protect the botting dosh right?
---
Think about it like this. You’ve got a region, or half a region, or maybe two regions, with every system visited, and every active sig written down in a spreadsheet. 
---
In the current system, you fly in circles around your scanned region and know that any new sig is probably a relic site. But most of the time you’ll fly into a system, see all sigs already ignored, or already on your list if you’ve had to log out (CCPls allow sigs to be ignored even after a logout), and just move on. 
---
Now, you check through agency, see new sigs popping up, and go to them to scan. No mindless trolling though systems waiting for something to appear. 
---
I mean, I really don’t think it’s as huge of a change as people think. Just a minor quality of life thing for explorers who stay in one area. I guess it helps bots more than it does real people.
---
God please?
---
 Take the first wh you find. Problem solved.
---
The people were already flagged, the character was to send a message to if a person thought they were incorrectly flagged as a bot
---
So everyone flagged as a bot gets to remember the heroism of tank man while unflagging themselves
---
I have, it throttles to 800mhz.
---
xD
---
To be fair, the current system is search dotlan to find a large ish circle of space in a good region with a low amount of jumps. Now fly in this circle over and over, since any new sigs you see will probably be the relic sites you’ve cleared coming off reapawn. 
---
Hardly exploration. Even in J space you aren’t finding anything new
---
And why is that particularly necessary?
---
Lmfao.  Just because they put Chinese, they are racist?  Seems to me that he got made because slyce was taking away from his income.  Good job Slyce!  I salute you.

&gt;JUNE FOURTH 1989 TIANANMEN SQUARE
---
You can watch the news report on the incident here #neverforget  [https://abcnews.go.com/International/video/june-1989-tiananmen-square-massacre-47773209](https://abcnews.go.com/International/video/june-1989-tiananmen-square-massacre-47773209)
---
Yeah Americans got it real rough with people judging them.
---
Where’s the option to remove the CSM completely?
---
I like that one, the rail version, and this blaster version.
---
It's a suicide ship although I knew if I tagged the caracal with scram he'd die so fast. The drones i expected to just scare off the frigs but I didn't expect them to get a kill also lol
---
o7 N7
---
wow that is a very nice search engine you found
---
maybe because Slyce sucks balls and the Chinese renters do not?
---
That means that panfam has the least bots! And I damn well know our NBIs and leadership will deal with it so yea, proud to be a bean :D
---
Define irrelevant. Also, even the closed ones were associated with people, they just made new names for the same group.
---
this is a post about goons not NCPLPH and their botting empire.
---
Slyce is a garbage corp in Dead Co.  they were kicked and are throwing a hissy fit.
---
Sorry, I don’t like dying to cloaky campers that don’t show up in local. Might try it if I start dualboxing my own cloaky backup, but not now
---
Will you pledge to keep up the fight to get Cat ears and tails in the game?
---
If so you got my vote.
---
LOL Sort despite his emotional upswings, he had good days and was fair. It would have been dishonorable to leave him during the various wars or conflicts. On principle alone is why we stayed.
---
That's a simplistic worldview. Slyce is not in fault of committing any crime I concede, or sending anyone to jail, but is it nice to do so? That's another matter. Much of the lasting relationships based on being considerate, not pointing fingers to see who is to be blamed.
---
This is irrelevant of what's the real deal is anyway: Sort used this as an excuse to purge Slyce in favour of botters. Did Slyce deserve this? No. At most they just needed to issue an internal apology, but Rick wasn't given the chance; the implications are clear. Just that Slyce played into Sort's hands by giving him exactly what he needed: an excuse.
---
sorry you dont know how to use dscan or your brain for that matter.
---
Legit lol.
---
Key word was "Now" not previously. Irrelevant means not clearly affiliated with a null bloc / just loses shitfits in lowsec
---
Well, I hope slyce finds themselves some more deserving friends. I'm just some random dino skirm fc but I'd love to have you nerds around on our side if that's where the winds take you
---
we still do ninjas, you can join the public server here https://discord.gg/k2GXxPh
---
Did you have the people to take him down?
---
Can someone point out where he doxxed? I don't see any doxxing. Obviously I don't want the actual details but if you have the ping and can just whiteout the actual doxx info I'd appreciate it. Everything I've seen doesn't show doxxing so far.
---
That literally sums up most of wh space
---
Fucking hell, I'll never understand this whers are elite and never turn down fights meme
---
I got to know Was a diplo contacted before the kick?
---
He did.
---
It would be a lot of work but it would be interesting to see where the pilots from these close/irrelevant corps ended up (i'm guessing they would just form a new corp and continue their activities)
---
and then he called them racist for referencing Tiananmen square, so its a ouble crybaby move for shart dragon.
---
That actually is racist you dumb motherfucker lmao
---
Well, yeah. It's renters and alts
---
Didn’t know dscan worked on cloaked people /s
---
Ffs theres no racism. Bringing up a forbidden massacre which obviously fucking happened isnt racism.
---
Yep, form a fleet too, although I can't remember whether the rewards are shared or just go to whoever took the mission.
---
Your diagram is just completely wrong. Fire is red+renters+shadow making 20% alone. Also counting them as a separate coalition and not legacy affiliates is kinda debatable.
---
Why would you contact anyone, ever before reporting a bot?
---
Bot belonged to xix in name only. It was well understood that it was an nc. Alt and rental alliance
---
ccplease rollback to two weeks ago when brisc wasn't shitposting
---
*occasionally*
---
Back in like, 2009? I really dont remember... The plate blaster penis could easily dunk battleships all day.
---
I mean if you want me to make Legacy's number bigger I go and tweak it. I based it off of a Coalition list posted a few weeks ago.
---
How you run a allaince is beyond me
---
I think we're in for a sino-soviet war
---
 You are trying to tell me ：
---
Chinese gov Killing Chinese people
---
Chinese gov =  Evil/bastard 
---
Chinese gov = Chinese people = Evil/bastard ???
---
Are they committing suicide? 
---
   
---
I am playing a game. 
---
Why are we talking about FXXKing Chinese !!
---
but what about contacting a diplo?
---
Now this is podracing!
---
Its a clown world. Honk honk.
---
by retards like you, sure
---
it was sold to xix. xix paid the former nc rental managers (fafer, ladyscarlet iirc) to continue managing it because it was a very large rental empire, xix didn't have anyone experienced in managing a rental empire, and the nc managers offered their services, for a price
---
Now... RMT bans on the other hand....
---
An arbitrarily large amount.
---
You're also likely to get wet if you attempt to piss in your mouth.
---
Majority of those alliances were the former DRF / Red Menace renters. I'd assume they just moved somewhere nearby.
---
You missed the perfect day by a little less than a month
---
What a great story! I can't wait to read the next part!
---
I think this chart means the opposite...
---
This is a bad analogy because botting does not have a direct victim like a rape does.
---
One of the benefits of too much isk in the game, people are more charitable.
---
I was on this fleet. Pretty hilarious how quickly it escalated to 2b+
---
I recognize your name, seen you on my previous article posts!
---
Thanks man. Really glad to see the support.
---
Thank you for this, good post.
---
Unfortunately you might be waiting a long time for that.
---
Thank you nonetheless. :)
---
I think it’s fine to have XIX and co separated as they are just harboured refugees and not exactly renters as kid with guns and co. It’s just important to keep in mind the relationship and that Test actually saved from destruction the biggest botters in new Eden when you see all the recent screeching about fighting boting.
---
You are making the assumption that people who rent want to go on fleets or have ctas.
---
I'd argue that it means that Panfam either has the most bots, the worst, or a combo of both.
---
I mean, I was in InP before the casino war. I think I know a bit about how things were ran
---
Hi Karina!
---
Who gives a fuck? Report all the damned bots and get them out of this game...
---
the mittani told them too
---
This was one of my favorite fleets.
---
XIX and KWG are in Legacy's numbers. 
---
FI.RE is Red Alliance
---
See this list for how I did the majority of the groupings:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/birss7/00_coalition_list_may_2019/
---
But according to mittani that would be blue fucking
---
I think this is the first time that being called a racist, and being forced out of an organization for it is a net positive for whoever it happened to.
---
Well ok you’re actually just an idiot.

Don't worry, they'll fix it in 3-5 years.  GOTTA RELEASE, NO TIME TO QA!  -The CCP Way
---
We had something similar happen to some Brave newbies back in the day, dude had his first carrier and was showing it off to his friend in a belt, oblivious to a roaming gang we were running, we managed to jump on him and his newbro buddy, little dude managed to jam up the tackler long enough that the carrier nearly got free, even so newbro was super bummed that his buddies carrier got killed.
---
Anyhow a couple of us started chatting with the guy afterwards in local and the newbro ended up with like 10 billion isk from randoms and some tricks and tips for avoiding gangs. I do love newbros.
---
One thing I appreciate about goons is they tend to be rather practical with no hand holding in their entire approach to things.
---
If you play smart and x, y, and z when trouble comes, help will be there. If you don't, well you'll collect your insurance because you didn't do what was necessary for us to be able to help you.
---
I will say in the alliances I've been part of / fought against, goons has easily been one of the more chill ones even if they've got a bit more beurocracy than the one's I've dealt with in the past. Even the few times I've fought them usual comms post fight win or lose was stuff like "good fight" etc. Way nicer then the trolly smack talk I see from a lot of other groups. (Granted my sample size from trading blows with goons is small as we wound up allies when BoB became public enemy number one)
---
Probably shouldn’t point fingers if you don’t know who is affiliated with who and what’s the history of these alliances. Or maybe you can get a job at Ccp policing csm actually...
---
does lotsa what if scenarios of different sci-fi universes some of them are pretty cool. pretty chill guy on his videos at least.
---
I mean, these are the same yahoos that say its intentional that you can't search "-" anymore for systems.  I wouldn't hold my breath on this retardation not going live.

Someone who doesn't play the game.  Unfortunately, nearly every current EVE dev falls under this category so it doesn't really narrow it down much.

So you have wiped clean many of PANFAMs numbers because they have controlled numerous botti...I mean, RM...I mean, rental groups in the past.
---
if it's a game, and everything is supposed to be left in game, why do people keep posting about tiananmen square all the time?
---

and it doesn't really change your point. if you calculated the region-years of rentals for everyone in that pie chart, B0T wouldn't that far down from the top.

^^^^^ That's bait
---
bro for real... heres some tips on how to survive whs space as an explorer
---
check zkill. if there cloaked waiting they probably already killed someone before you got there.
---
\-ay attention. be on top of dscan all the time especially in a site, warp around to structures and planets outside of d, scan every thing down then pull probes and wait a couple mins. 
---
jump all whs. anything within like 6 of jita or amarr is more likely to be cloaky camped. and anything connected  to any sort of pvp crop will likely be dangerous also. besides that most of wh space is quiet. there are very few 
---
there are very few things that can actually catch you. a stealth bomber cause the targeting delay is so little. a smart bombing t3c but no one really does that. a cloaked saber is possible but again so unlikely that you will probably never see it.  and i guess like a seeboed astero or something like that. besides those few things if something decloaks on you warp immediately you have about 5 seconds and more often than not you will get out. 
---
most of the explorers ive ever killed would have lived if they followed these rules. and the chances that someone is actually waiting in a site before you get in system is wayyyy smaller than you think.
---
I read about German news broadcast that showed whole incident. Unlike US one-they showed that this guy was escorted out of harms way. America leaves that out because it ruins their narrative.
---
It shouldn't be surprising.  Their retarded hardon for Abyssmal space should have proven where they want this game to go; low effort instanced content when possible, and this is probably a step in that direction.
---
One other point that made it seem racist was the Diplo used to with the spreadsheet was named "Tiannamen Square Victim". Not saying it's racist or is not, thems just the facts

Nope

3 Hel bots.  Sort kicked an entire alliance from his coalition to protect them.
---
Well I'm the post it said "talk to our Diplo: 'Tiannamen Square Vuctim' " so that's what made me say it was a Diplo.
---
Anyone who supports/flies under/makes agreements with Sort kind of deserves whatever shit they get, TBH.  It's like sticking your dick in the garbage disposal and being surprised when it comes out looking like last night's hamburger.  I mean, really?  You support one of the biggest lying backstabbers in the history of EVE, common sense FTW?
---
Carriers? That is Geminate, we can actually afford Supers and Titans to drop in Delve
---
Not AFK. I'm active in other ways. If playing Eve only meant time in fleet, 82% of Goons, PL, Test, and NC would be "not playing Eve"
---
amazing
---
wait I have to pay you guys to kill botters? LOL.
---
I have, frequently. It's called having a life, and it's all those people who left Eve and never returned, or have never played that I want to capture. If you hold everyone to a standard that only fits your expectations, you're cutting out a huge part of the Eve community.
---
Appreciate that TEST bros!

Are modern day Germans living in a society that was built on the slave labour employed during the Holocaust? Are they *still* complicit in a society that oppresses those people that were inslaved?

If you answered yes to both of those, them yes, it **is** kinda like that.
---
Hey, I used to live in that system. Good to see it dying in a fire.
---
Yea sure the alliance kick maybe might have been some what justified. But if doxxing is real then he should be pema banned period. And not perma banned like his ban is lifted in next two weeks... but full on gone. That shit is way over the limit.

Wonder how many faction forts he’ll need to give ccp for a ceasefire
---
Great question, @Garric_Shadowbane! Also, is your name an homage to the Thief franchise of games? (If so, well done.)
---
My area of expertise is new players, and teaching them to play EVE, recruiting them to the game, and developing the players and communities we have. I write for EVE media, teach, mentor, guest host on podcasts, stream, constantly submit feedback and change suggestions to devs, am active in the community (I hosted a monthly meetup for two years), and I'm even an /r/EveJobs moderator. For the last two years that's been on top of working two full time jobs and having a daughter.
---
I look at the game from the lens of, "How will this help people stay? How does that release or feature draw new players? How can a UI change improve retention? Are we recruiting from the right vertical markets?" In essence, I think more like a Dev than most players do, and I care about both sides of that fence. I want to see the tired trope of "EVE is dying" die in a fire. 
---
There has never been a better time to play EVE, and a big part of what keeps players from joining, or from coming back, is US. It's not CCP. It's our community. We are simultaneously the reason people stay, and the reason people leave. I feel that if I can, as a member of the CSM, work with CCP and the other Council members that we can make it easier for people to change and improve how we go about growing this game, our alliances and communal story politic, and the community at large.
---
Doesn't have enough!

Slyce died for our sins

I was actually just writing up a reply to that point haha.
---
If it did anyone's reputation any favors it was actually Solar Empire, whose two renter groups made up ~18% combined. 
---
There might be a former NC / N3 group there but that's right where my Eve time started so thats hazy. To my knowledge the only direct pets PL had was Tangra and their numbers are included.
---
I'll quickly do a historical view but for some of the groups I either haven't heard of them, or the group they were under is well and truely lost to history.
---
More quality shitposting.
---
It's not the goons themselves, but the leadership. Like every other organization lmao
---

---
&gt;CCP not taking action on this 
---
On corporation and alliance membership decisions though? That seems unusual for CCP to intervene in.
---
I'm responding to the idea that a CSM member has to conform to a narrow definition of what makes an EVE player. Does lack of participation in PVP invalidate the efforts of every industrialist in EVE? What about the diplomats and Logi bros? 
---
In part, that same narrow expectation keeps a lot of players from finding joy in playing EVE.

See here for historical coalitions. Some of these groups either belonged to Alliances / Coalitions who are also themselves dead so it's too difficult to try and link them to current groups. 
---
Also included is the groupings / numbers. Yes I know it adds to 101. Blame /u/CCP_Peligro, firstly for using a Pie Chart, secondly for being sensible and rounding his numbers.
---
Even your quote suggests that it was soldiers and police who were attacked by "peaceful" protesters. If this is discussion about botters-what exactly does Tiananmen Square incident have to do with that? Im pretty certain nobody from there is botting.
---
Maybe you contact the diplo, so they would tell you how to not get caught by ccp :D
---
You don't want to run C3s. You'll have to use an expensive ship and you'll probably get ganked and die horribly long before it's paid off. You're much better off finding a C13 and flying a confessor. It's much cheaper, faster, safer, and you can do it with very low SP investment.
---
Solar is just legit dead now. Since the glorious botting history relates to the old drf empire it used to be ally with XIX (actual fire) even though they had conflicting history. Solar didn’t survive the arrival of skill u and the fall of drone regions. XIX was saved by test, red alliance by goons but solar just died there. 
---
It’s good food for thought to remember that both goons and test saved the remaining botlords from drone regions on their way to the dumpster.
---
Are you purposefully demonstrating to everyone your lack of reading comprehension?

1. We emailed our spreadsheet to 3 CCP employees privately.

&gt;As per the previous post, just because your coalition is here does not necessarily mean that it is filled with bots, this is a overview of 16 years of bans, people / alliances change.
---
I think this is an important point to consider, this data set it very watered down, the only real information from this are just how much the recently created groups on this list are getting banned
---
Frat and skillu for instance both have 1~1.5 year old groups on this list that together make up 10% of the permanent bans over the past 16(?) years. If anyone wants to fight against bots those should be the two prime targets to be fighting
---
I remember elo making daily posts about delve bots not very long ago, turns out delve doesn't have many bots but his alliance, fraternity, is full of them

The one I wish I had recorded was in the middle of a large and laggy fleet, where the titans were glitching pretty badly.  One titan warped off backwards from a gate, and another aligned at about the same speed as a cruiser.

I'm not arguing to say that the word "holocaust" has a sole meaning. But it's rather obvious that when someone uses the word "holocaust" without a context indicating otherwise (e.g. "nuclear holocaust"), it refers to the Nazi Holocaust. This is common sense and you are arguing against it.
---
"Holocaust", even without the definite article, by default refers to the Nazi Holocaust unless otherwise specified. I'm not sure which variation of English you speak but this is how it works for the majority.
---
However no broadcast showed what happened after that.

To Test maybe.

Because you completely misunderstand the renting, which is a way to play the game without the most boring and niche part of it (pvp). What is less boring, paying 100mil ISK, or dealing with a roaming frigate? Clearly the latter can inflict way more loss even if it doesn't kill anything, as alternative cost of dealing with it instead of making ISK, so dealing with him with ISK is faster and more efficient way to be left to your own devices. As long as there's ANYONE who can either deal with those frigates or find a way to have less of them in his space, he will have renters paying him, no matter how small of an "entity" he is. As long as this basic condition is fulfilled, renters have no reason to say "screw you", and if it's not, it's time to move to someone who can fulfill it.
---
In eve, owning a pvp ship is a loss of money, and doing it is a loss of time. No renter worth his krab shell would do it.

I don't think he's an sjw he's just fucking brain dead

Following up to your edit: the phrase I used in the very beginning was "Holocaust victims". It's rather clear what it's referring to even without the definite article. I do not understand how you may interpret this as "the victims of an unspecified mass killing" instead of the victims of the Nazi genocide against Jews.

The school cirriculum doesn't even have anything about what happened. There was a thing not too long ago about Taiwan being edited _for foreign publication._

It may also be that groups like imperium (which do have a number of bots just like everyone else) are split over a number of alliances within their coalition such as PLA, TNT, Bastion etc etc.

This is probably also true with the coalitions with a larger number of alliances

every year on Jan 27th Germany has set aside a day to remember these things

then again on Dec 19th there is another day to remember specific genocide that happened

germany doesn't shirk from their responsibilities and misdeeds, they remember them so that they never happen again

Again, you are wrong.  Now though you are deliberately making shit up too.  No, there is no default in the English language that automatically assumes one is speaking of The Holocaust when saying holocaust.  That is a blatant lie.  
---
I give you Merriam-Webster;
---
Definition of holocaust
---
1 : a sacrifice (see SACRIFICE entry 1 sense 2) consumed by fire
---
2 : a thorough destruction involving extensive loss of life especially through fire
---
a nuclear holocaust
---
3a ******usually****** the Holocaust : the mass slaughter of European civilians and especially Jews by the Nazis during World War II
---
Several members of her family died in the Holocaust.
---
a Holocaust survivor
---
*************b : a mass slaughter of people
---
especially : GENOCIDE
---
a holocaust in Rwanda***********
---
GFs all around. Two hours late for work but worth it.
---
I interpret this as the victims of an unspecified mass killing because that is literally what happened, and that is literally the definition.
---
Keep citing things that aren't supporting your argument though.

I'm not arguing against it, I'm giving you the literal definition.  YOU are interpreting the way you want to.

I mean naming it that is at the very least antagonistic, but sort is also using the racism excuse to protect his bots. They're both in the wrong in different ways and to different degrees and sort is using one to excuse the other.

Can you imagine a second "We're removing this CSM member for being a shitlord" article in such a short time?  It would almost look as if CCP has no idea what they're doing...oh, wait.

They've absolutely taken action against players for out of game comments. Stunt being the easiest example.
---
You said "cockroaches" twice.
---
So how can you claim he survived when theres no way to know what happened after it. Or do you think a Regime that massacres its own people, works towards an ethnic cleansing and sends people into reeducation camps for having the wrong opinions is gonna invite him over for coffee and cake? Just how obvlivious to reality or straight up brainwashed can you be?

We should just elect James 315 to the CSM and add the New Halaima Code of Conduct to the EULA so that we can avoid this sort of thing.

---
The definition of "holocaust" is "a mass killing", not "an unspecified mass killing". Exactly which event it refers to depends on the context.
---
By convention, "Holocaust victims" refers to the victims of the Nazi Holocaust. This is supported by the usage of the phrase in the titles of articles I have linked. Please elaborate why these citations are irrelevant.

We remember tiananmen square, the people who stood up to the atrocities and the people who died there so that we don't make the same mistakes, so people understand that neutrality is indifference. everyone picks a side, there are people who stand up for what's right, like tank man, and then there's every one else

Maybe the people offended by the memory are the people who most need to remember

It can be, there is the player who mines in HS with his 4 alts in exhumers and his corporation that is just him and a bunch of athanors, or ratters who just like watching the ISK ticker go up. It can be chill. I personally have alts set up to just chill and rat some days when I just want to enjoy a cup of whatever drink I decide to have and watch my wallet fill. The best part of EVE is that it can be whatever you want it to be.
---
Ooo and Vlade is back in charge.  That was also a promised No-No.  I'm beginning to think that Sortles isn't sincere when he makes promises to the devs and Eve community.  Also, why are those doxxers still playing Eve?  Seems both he and CCP are fairly fluid in the execution of their morality.
---
Perhaps a “where they were” graph but don’t fall victim to us requesting you do more work than you have done.

The real question is whether you can punch in a wormhole system and basically spy on ratting activity, and/or general activity. If so this will be broken for the week it's allowed.

Can "holocaust" mean an unspecified mass killing?
---
Yes it can
---
Can "holocaust" mean The Holocaust?
---
When does it mean which?
---
It depends on the context
---
You are putting up a straw man saying that I say one automatically assumes one is speaking of The Holocaust when saying holocaust, which has never been my point. I kept iterating *context* (or the lack of thereof in a simple phrase like "Holocaust victims") but you seems to ignore it.
---
Nice try. I mean terrible try.
---
They're releasing a card like this in modern horizons but it's B and has sacrifice a creature for each activation instead of tapping.
---
3 Hels with X-Large shield boosters, lmao
---
Because it’s rubbing their nose in something that has nothing to do with them. Reporting the boys is fine and should be done but the rest is just asinine.
---
I don't really care to weigh in on your argument itself, but prejudice based on nationality is not called racism... it is called xenophobia
---
I'm going to assume "'Eve' is dying" is akin to "PC gaming is dying", lol.
---
But awesome! Thanks a ton.
---
Marinate a goose?  Like with a Worcestershire style sauce?  Or maybe a sweet citrus kind?

---
Pretty bad timing
---
listing coalitions is useless,   what this data tells us,  is that rental alliances are full of bots.  Wich makes sense, who ever has the biggest rental empire,   has the most bots.  
---
Historicly speaking,   i would say that the combined space of PANFAM+FIRE+HL makes up for 33pct of the banned accounts.  
---
Add to the fact,  that a majority doesnt get banned.   
---
It would be interesting to see, if major blocks could come to an agreement where harboring bots is reconized by all leadership lvls and terms and conditions can be made.
---
subcap fight was a 70/30 split in favor of panfam. sad that those hero Dreads had to die. intense fight with a lot of awesome piloting and FC work. Cheers to all who participated.
---
it's a player made list of which there are no consequences for being on. if someone doesn't want to remember tank man they can safely ignore the list and go on with their lives

---
I hope you guys get through this intact. Respect for what you managed to build, hopefully now you'll get to do it with some integrity somewhere else.
---
Maybe kickstart something new? Something independent? Scalding Pass is pretty wild and free these days...
---
"Unspecified mass killing" was your phrase not mine.  
---
Clearly holocaust victims does not refer solely to victims of The Holocaust perpetrated by Nazi Germany, but also the poor victims of this man's bot crusade.  It is labeled such and lines up perfectly with multiple definitions and examples that are readily available to you through a quick google.  
---
As my own source stated, usually it refers to the WW2 holocaust, but clearly not always as it references an rwandan holocaust.
---
I can't tell if this is a joke or a serious thing..
---
Another alliance announced they joined when they formed dumpster fire. They did join but when hanzo spent 3 weeks getting his shit pushed in by skillu around MTO2 he saw better than to try and link up with them. 100% he intended to join properly but couldn’t and now has to pretend that ‘hey bro it’s just a prank’.

What is the difference between ZombieFoetus and one of my cheap 3D prints?

My cheap 3D prints survive getting stomped on by me.

Shield blaster thorax is the best. Super fast, reasonable tank and absolutely shits out DPS. It can comfortably solo any other t1 cruiser

because it's ok to be racist as long as you have a dino flair

Well I have been over-worked the last few months and had little-to-no time for space pixels but tl;dr things changed for the positive and you might see a BBTB alt pop up more frequently in the East.  I don’t know if you’ll ever see the activity levels and interaction from me like the ROIR days but I plan on picking up the cyno again, so to say. Perhaps you can jump to it in the future.

Hey we're trending!  Better roll out the recruiting carpet!
---
&gt;Can "holocaust" mean an unspecified mass killing?
---
You are putting up a straw man saying that I say one automatically assumes one is speaking of The Holocaust when saying holocaust, which has never been my point.
---
_______
---
&gt; "Holocaust", even without the definite article, by default refers to the Nazi Holocaust unless otherwise specified.
---
You are so fucking upside down in your horrible argument that you can't even remember what you are saying dude.  Go to bed, you are bad at this.
---
'Never give up
---
You're the one whos brainwashed. They dont massacre their own people, work on ethnic cleansing or send people to reeducation camps for wrong opinion. You're mixing up your propaganda about China with one about North Korea. Its true that they send former Uighur TERRORISTS to reeducation camps. So that said terrorists can become productive members of society. Rumor about reeducation camps is from unverified UN report, that has been picked up by pathetic US "news" in attempt to demonize China. Only "ethnic cleansing" happening is Uighur radicals chanting that "Streets will run red with Han Chinese blood". Nobody is massacring anyone there, thanks to Chinese police and general nature of Asian cultures.
---
Honestly if sbsq stays separate then they won't drag the rest of the Russians down with him with Branch flops into the dumpster, which seems sooner than ever with today's events.
---
It might be strange to say that's a good thing, but I kind of want the Russians to succeed in the south and go back to being independent so there's more shakeups in the blue donut.
---
Sbsq is still getting wrecked around MTO2/HD-J so by all means I hope skillu keeps it up.
---
&gt;I'm against this. The Reason why is because it (together with other similar additions) would overcomplicate the Menues to extreme levels so it would be even harder for new players to get a grasp on eve.
---
&gt;
---
Dude you're talking about a game that doesn't even show newbies where their wallet is anymore.
---
Cut my life into pieces, this is my last resort. Defamation, no massacre, don't give a fuck if I neg wallet my alliance, botting. 
---
(I tried)
---
&gt;unless otherwise specified.
---
That is the fucking context mate. And you don't even quote the part where I mentioned context. How desperate are you?
---
cant wait for the chinese invasion :D
---
That's what I was wondering.  Slyce joins Legacy when?
---
They're a renter corp so obviously they don't allow bots, they prefer to be called androids.
---
that whole album is amazing
---
Sometimes I wonder whether the first inkling of extra terrestrial life will not be when one of our ships is hit by some ancient civilisation’s ammunition hitting it, that had been traveling through space for hundreds of millions of years.
---
I mean if CCP wanted to be truly telling they could just release the bot numbers by region by year. Would paint a much clearer picture of the wheres and whens people were banned. I would say likely the densest concentration would be in the drone lands. Followed by the middle North Fountain and Delve would be a close 3rd and 4th. Then just about all the angel space.
---
The funny thing is if they remove all the signatures again, their new fancy agency window will be half empty again. 
---
Lots of things to click, but nothing of value to be found.
---
(So why even have this thing in the firstplace? New Player Experience?)
---
Now imagine removing these worthless resource wars too, and all that's left is the agent finder and an incursion dashboard.
---
Don't get me wrong, folks. I think that cosmic signatures shouldn't be shown there too.
---
Ahhh the things you do to please your new chinese botters and make bulk isk off them
---
 We do apologize for hunting bots gathering evidence and then sending the info to ccp 
---
We also apologize for moving from middle deklin forceably to allow said botters to replace us and for them to bulk up sorts pocket 
---
We apologize for forming to save the same peoples structures from being blown up mutipul of them but yet they had zero people show up from the owners alliance.
---
Instead of comming up with bullshit sort how bout you say it as it is you want to make a save heaven for the new chinese members comming over from serenity at the expense of old loyal members.
---
That's is not the eve way THAT IS NOT THE AUSSIE WAY

I know you need Sovereignity to Build SuperCapitals/titans. Recently i build and mine for myself a Thanatos in high sec (erll, mine in high, made in low) and curious about what power blocks allow to foot members to build supercapitals. Renters are ok. Thinking in mine for myself in a barge for a year a Nyx and doit myself. (Already have a titan and nyx in lowsec but were purchased, no made)
---
Yeah, you know. I've been around rofl.
---
Exiles himself when he etbs if you control no other creatures.  Might be good in a black devotion deck if you build around him but probably just a sideboard card against control.
---
If you think goons don't bot, put blue eyes in B-7DFU and watch as supers get stuck in rock formations for 30+ minutes, supers and carriers sitting on MTU's as they rat overnight.. lol.
---
Why? What happened?
---
You know, many pve players are just too shy to speak
---
How do you propose that alliance leaders feasibly police bots given that there is no way for them to kick individual players from the alliance other than yelling at the corp leader? Or, if you are proposing that any alliance that has a botter in it gets punished, well... that seems like it's super easy for anyone that hates a particular alliance to abuse.

Dreads did keep them busy while we got a new ihub installed. Had we jumped our slow arse baltech subcaps in, it would have been even worst. Does not help that the FC sound like he wanted a well-deserved rest as well.

That's just how we play normally, our artificial intelligence is indistinguishable from true stupidity.

So you're saying it's racist to talk about the Trail of Tears?

you might want to check fraternity and HRE space for the bots, ccp says that's where all the recent bans are going. 10% of all bans made the past ~13 years were made in the last ~1.5 years and were made to fraternity treasury and skillu groups

Did not Gigx get permabanned for a LOT less then what Sort Dragon did ?

Step up CCP and ban Sort Dragon.

Sort Dragon has to be perma banned from EVE for Doxxing and beyond toxic behaviour !

To be fair, that fit is designed to do literally nothing but max tank... and nobody brought anything to counter it (neuts, caps, ships with high DPS)

Technically, yes. But it's pretty well accepted in colloquial usage that it applies to nationality too.

The UN's 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination says this about racial discrimination:

Chinese want to erase this from their memories... like germans do with, gas factories and zyklon b showers.

Maybe it's forward thinking.  In a year or two when the chinese government owns tranquility it might be worth virtue signaling right now so you don't get ran over by tanks later.

I do have literally ALL relevant skills to 5, but hp/s doesn't matter. It's how you fly it. If I fly it well, I take almost no damage. It's Suitonia's build [which I have linked](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76605685/). If you fly this ship outside of abyss, you sub the cap battery for a warp disruptor, and you fly very similarly. You need to kite, not brawl. If the enemy is doing significant damage it is either a bad matchup or you are flying incorrectly.

If Sort should be banned for this, then so should Mittens. Cause he actually said exact same thing about why Imperium botters shouldn't be reported to CCP.

Out of curiosity, what do members of Horde need to do to get into Legion? IIR horde was a recruitment newb base for legion. Since apparently everyone has supers the requirement is "be able to just press more buttons and have a brain"?

All are members are called beans and are new members are called NewBeans. On account of our logo, I belive.

If sort gets banned, itd be for doxing that guy

Just don't make any spreadsheets about historical Chinese events and hunting bots though.

Ah, I haven't felt like this since I first started reading this subreddit.

It's almost nostalgic.

we have our own tryhard groups inside of horde. not sure if there is a pipeline to legion from horde, but if there is one it runs through vanguard. however why anyone would want to leave horde is beyond me, this is where the party is.

theres multiple kinds of fw bots, which ones do you mean? :P

Chinese people exist. Tiananmen square exists, and the massacre happened.

Talking about this event is not racist.

Good estimate, 36% according to the numbers I pulled off the tweet.

Is it even poor taste? I think more people know what this even means now than before, which honors the victims that might be forgotten. Idk. Is that poor taste?

I dont see how this can be ...

If you in a fit of ( understandable ) rage tell someone you will hurt them - that is considered a horrible deed worthy of perma ban. Because you have no way of actually doing anything about it and are simply letting off salty steam, because that guy just falcon punched you and is now gleaming on voice comms over it. 
---
On  the other hand you publicly share real life information of a player. But not just share it, but ping it to a large audience. Then you proceed to smear said player, using his real life name. This is beyond condemning ! This is beyond horrible ! Sort should not just be perma banned from EVE, but shunned as a person you would be affiliated with. 
---
This is a GAME - GAME !
---
Sharing personal information, without said persons consent, is appalling, Not to mention Ilegal in some country's. For a good reason as well !

That’s just a bit douchey and unwarranted... having trouble in RL??

Botters are welcome in period basis!! The more the merrier, and the more Isk we make plus adm prop up, if you need some links to guides and software shoot me a dm

well i aint kinkshaming so if thats your thing go for it

Why is it racist to mention Tiananemn Square?     Is it racist to find their system of government abhorrent, and is it racist to find them massacring their own people like that a terrible thing?

%99 of farming bots in this game use subcaps (mostly VNIs, some nightmares) or supers. This ship is pretty much only good for subcaps. Those bots rat aligned and will warp off the moment a neutral ship decloaks on grid. Currently the only way to catch them is bubbling their path back or hoping they are tackled by NPCs. 
---
This ship would be a helpful bot catcher only if it has 0 recalibration (like a bomber) and really fast targeting. Its self defeating if you give it bad targeting. Giving it 0 dps is a much better trade off.

HORDE wasn't meant as a recruitment pool for PL (more a meatshield teaching org) though some beans do end up joining them. Most of the nerd-active Hordelings tend to stay in the alliance these days, though, what with the proliferation of gated corps and sigs to join.

And the ceo can allow acces to a shared hangar and/or wallet division. Actually having a few bil in stuff there is a good shit test, if people are willing to betray you for that then its better to know sooner rather than later (when they kiss ass so much they get director roles)
---
KWG was paying isk to XX until Tapi moved in into area and became biggest power.
---
There are super bots. But you can't tackle them without a HIC point or a bubble. So this ship would only be viable with subcap bots.

im not saying GSF is all botters, but it is suprising that the biggest alliance in the game doesn't even account for 1% of the botters in eve. wouldn't you agree?

They did, and we understand and have never struggled to still think highly of them. Quality folks that other groups are hopefully fully appreciating.

I wonder why

Dude doxxed somebody. Forget the CSM, he needs to be permabanned from the game.
---
Yeah, same. Somehow every criticism of the Chinese government is just ignorant and arrogant foreigners insulting the Chinese nation as a whole. Interact with enough Chinese people and you're bound to find quite a few who actually buys this bullshit too.
---
Tbf, I wouldn't be surprised if a significant portion of all bans are from theast two years or so. Historically CCP hasn't exactly been known for a hard stance on botters. Plus the number of bots has also increased over the years. 
---
Not to excuse any one alliance, just thinking the numbers of bots banned are far from equal over the years and a number of bots banned in a certain year would be far more insightful.

It's hardly racist to acknowledge that "chinese bots" is a cliche for a reason, be it in other MMOs or Eve. Look at Serenity as an example. Consider the fact that botting/cheating is culturally far more accepted there, as status is so valuable that it doesn't matter that it's bought/cheated/fake etc.

Greeting people grinding shit with "Ni hao!" became a thing because statistically it's almost certainly a chinese bot.

Absolutely! Which BoT/Panfam corp are looking to join?! I here they accept bots all the time!
---
I'm going to be honest now it's about time GOTG removed Sort and Darkness.  Not sure why Rick has just bent knee and said yeah well leave without standing his ground and saying no.  I'm sure other alliances would be happy to help get rid of the ozzie little fat shit.
---
what
---
Yea, that makes sense. I wouldn't mind having such a system where a bad actor can steal let's say max one days worth of assets that we generate. Good idea!
---
Man, seek Jesus help.
---
Where would Delve bots show up in the current data? Who ever held Delve who has a lot of bans?
---
Ah, that settles most of my fears. Thanks!
---
Not a \*CENSORED\* square victim?
---
I hear the lovemaking closely resembles a Stabber trying to bump a Dominix.
---
&gt;I mean if CCP wanted to be truly telling they could just release the bot numbers by region by year. Would paint a much clearer picture of the wheres and whens people were banned. I would say likely the densest concentration would be in the drone lands. Followed by the middle North Fountain and Delve would be a close 3rd and 4th. Then just about all the angel space.
---
They already said they'll be releasing year to date information soon(tm)
---
On this occasion - real question - will the trig incursion kill all the citadels in the affected area!
---
Remember to train up your learning skills pookie
---
CCP also gave the HAC t2 cap regen and the command destroyer much needed speed
---
I feel like was a bit short changed knowing that they already knew all the solutions to all the cards before they were released. I was told I'd be doing a science.
---
Huh, I wonder if Slyce will join panfam. They were always pretty competent back in the C4C days. They wouldn't even have to move shop if we scooted some forts 10 jumps down the pipe.
---
It's honestly a difficult question to answer. Depends on the context I would say. If we were discussing politics then I would have nothing against bringing it up along with other examples as human rights violations. But if it's brought up in random topics just because Chinese people are involved, it's insensitive. By comparison the trail of tears was an awful event in American history and should not be forgotten... But that doesn't make it okay to bring up in unrelated conversations.
---
Man. Seek help, Jesus.
---
For all of EVE time yes. I am more interested when the report comes out for just the past year.
---
Yep.         
---
People mix stuff, Chinese government want people to forget this as they used army against their own nation.           
---
People calling bringing this up a racism are just **dumb**.     
---
Fact is that if totalitarian government will manage to remove such thing from people memory it will be more willing to do it again and it will be much more victims ...
---
&gt;I just don't understand why you refused to let me in and lose the right way. From line one you were saying I was "fucking stupid".
---
Because you weren't a candidate even before you dropped out, and because you're fucking stupid.
---
Was the document posted by rick that the info came from publicly available?
---
You think one is way worse than the other because one has consequence *to you* and the other doesn't. Other people aren't you, and your "letting off steam" can be a much worse experience for them. Don't do it, it's shitty. People who are afraid of their internet persona being connected to your IRL life, consider being less shitty on the internet.
---
Doxxing can be much worse than just people finding out you're a shitlord on the internet, but that's connected to harassment and the harassment is the real problem.
---
I can't believe he got his own movie after all the stuff he's done
---
But it is not good to accuse every Chinese Eve player to be responsible for the Tiananmen square massacre. It is better to build bridges than walls.
---
nice kill
---
So when i was young my country was under "friendly" occupation by Russian forces.       
---
My grandfather was fighting for better future, he was 'visible' enough that we had visits militia accompanied with russian speaking people few times a month.         
---
Nothing like few grown man trying to 'ask questions' to a kid about his family ....         
---
Yet we managed to get our freedom.      
---
I wish good luck to you with getting yours, fight for it! It is worth it.
---
Nice, fuck em.
---
But bots are.
---
next you gonna tell me mentioning the holocaust is racist towards germans. you can fuck right off sir
---
Seems like they should at least have to be defended.
---
Lol
---
Abit like when you get paid to join an alliance for content and then announce your gonna run for CSM2019 and rid the game of bots who paid you in the first place I guess
---
Defended and endangered are two different things.        
---
If the Trig will poke the citadels like current FOB's ... they will be safe. 
---
If they will hit all what can find - then people will be forced to fight them of hire people that will do it.
---
Did you mean GigX ? Because his bannable offense was committed in alliance chat.
---
&lt;3
---
Somewhere on Sisi or elsewhere the Arc team said that this has been described as Chapter 1. Considering a gate confirmation will be required before entering invaded system doubt citadel destruction is on the cards.
---
As part of subsequent chapters i would hope the confirmation message would no longer be required and destruction would be on a larger scale.
---
Are you seriously going to try and rules lawyer doxxing when Shart himself admitted to putting the fuckin' real life name in a damn ping?
---
We cannot accuse every Chinese Eve player to be responsibel for the Tiananmem massacre. I can understand why they get upset about this. They don't have democracy, they don't have freedom of speech and they are not free to express their own point of view.
---
Gigx comment about the judge that got him banned was on a twitch livestream. He said it while playing another game.
---
Also you know how there has been a connection made between sansha and triglavians, whilst also confirmed on sisi that when they invade gate lights turn off suggesting changes to the map during incursions.
---
My isk is on a subsequent chapter leading to trigs makings their own gates to replace the blocked gates therefore leading to temporary Stain gates at times in order for them to exact some sort of revenge on sansha!
---
they didn't add that thing for nothing
---
What ?
---
BRB gonna make one right now
---
Love how people COUGH can be insta banned for unsubstantiated evidence, but when someone is clearly doxxing they can stay in the game 
---
nice priorities
---
How many does this make so far?
---
Ahhh flashbacks. Reminds me when Kenshin tried to doxx my friends for stealing their keepstar. Nothing ever came of that either
---
Shit Dragon did something retarded or backstabbed someone? MORE SHOCKING NEWS AT 11:00!
---
I'm more interesting in the administrative side. I want to mine minerals and build an empire, not so much fly a big ship and go pew pew.
---
Still plausible solo?
---
PC culture in EvE give me a break!
---
Lucky for me space is huge and I can find my own hole where I don't need to be around sensitive metro sexual morrons.
---
99.5% if the world is normal the 0.5% want us to be like them.
---
I SAY FK THAT all 0.5% ppl can move to an isolated island and see how well your society will survive and hey don't forget to inv a few Islam bois to with your rainbows and shit and see what happens to u when they be om majority. Fact check Lebanon 1970 ruffly.
---
So your program does not store/cache any data locally?
---
Not believing that till you release the source.
---
There truly is no finer place to be than New Eden :-).
---
Bob, I love that place!
---
And their government sanctioned botting.
---
But the mittani at fanfest
---
Triglavians don't understand Sansha Nation and they want to ... they are people that lost they way and many Triglavians that were integrated to Sansha Nation gave us all the answers.           
---
They try to be like us ... and cannot accept the fact that someone managed to do what they try to achieve for so long.
---
[shockingly enough it was Geminate](https://zkillboard.com/related/30002475/201903092100/)
---
Goons bot so much they didnt even make it to the top 25
---
Ur a tumor!
---
Something something jet fuel steel beams
---
15% tax? Isn't this a bit over the top?
---
Doesn't this basically encourage only the bots to join again? 
---
For me as a non-notting ratter, 15% is the ponit where i would seriously consider doing something else.
---
You won't be booted form it, but you won't be able to re-dock once you leave if you no longer have docking rights. If you have been inactive for an extended period, you can submit a support ticket to get yourself, one ship without a jump-drive, and it's cargo moved out of NS. This is mostly used if your corp has either kicked you for inactivity or moved. Otherwise if your corp hasn't moved I'd recommend getting back with them.
---
You're getting sloppy on these, almost 24hrs late.
---
IT Alliance used to have a ton of people who would run belt ratting bots. TEST and its allies held Delve for a while. Goons have held it 2-3 times. Renters populated it prior to the power projection nerfs. Dont take it as an implication that now Goons bot.
---
Nope.  
---
  
---
Millions of people are Chinese, part of the Chinese culture or of Chinese decent, without holding a Chinese passport. "Being Chinese" can be more than just the nationality, sweetie.
---
Germans are actually one of the few guys decent enough to admit to their wrongdoings. Even looking at their WW2 allies, Italians actually didn't even do anything noticeable and the Japanese portray themselves as victims while what they did rivals the Nazis.
---
Can you explain why you find it funny?
---
No, I'm seriously going to state that it's CCPS job to investigate for a reason. Additionally,  if the data was publicly available that's not doxxing.
---
I have 0 connection to Sort, but it's not our job as players to crucify other players. If you see something, report it. Trust the people that are paid to manage their game to do their job.
---
I expect that he will say that this data was fabricated by GSM
---
Don't be so harsh on him, he probably did not see any carrier yet, much less super. :D
---
Do I want a large number of people my RL information ?  
---
Ofcourse not.   
---
Not because I am an asshall online, but because there are some very, VERY, very disturbed people out there. Having someone harras my family or me because he lost a ship in PVP, got killed in ESO, lost a game of Apex because I was better then them in a game ? Thank you, but no.   
---
You are correct that I am  viewing this from personal perspective. Then again its hard to be objective in this sort of situation.  Very rarely will I get upset over something that happends in game. That is because of being a functioning adult. There are however some that do not function in such manner.   
---
Sort Dragon using someones RL credentials can be, quite literly, linked with Mittani in wizard hat incident. Mittens ban raised is another topic, but being banned in first place is proper reaction to that.
---
Did I read something incorrectly?  I thought Sort Dragon was the one to ban the racist Player/Corp from the alliance.
---
KWG also paid/pays money to Fraternity/Winterco, if that counts.
---
Stop being an asswipe. You doxxed the guy. You fucked up. Apologise instead of obfuscating.
---
I plan on releasing 1-2 cards a week on r/eve now based on events/people/game mechanics.
---
So I should have something good in store! Though a fair amount will be based on my corp members.
---
*Everything* is racist tho. Makes u think!!1
---
no idea, he started with that shit before i even played from what i was told
---
well most of those alliances are long gone, so i doubt that is the case. also it's not just botters, this is overall bans, so would be rmt'ers as well, plus whatever else people get banned for
---
Pelligro said it is same names different %
---
Go f**k yourself
---
how did you find out nationality of those botters?
---
rental alliances traditionally don't care about languages. so while the main alliance might be russian, their renters are usually from all over the world.
---
AKA a;
---
Random
---
Market
---
Transgression
---
I mean, who on earth posts lies on the internet?
---
It's so easy to be ridiculed and shamed because everyone can search up what you did and how you're wrong with ten clicks, only a fool would even try.
---
It'll never cease to amuse me that people get up in arms about people shitposting on Reddit, then equate said shitposting with "crucifixion". It's turbonerds shitposting on a shitposting sub, about other turbonerds doing shit in and out of the game. 
---
It has literally no impact whatsoever as long as *we* don't doxx etc, so you wanting us to censor ourselves and not show our viewpoints and standpoints because... reasons, is exceedingly nonsensical.
---
I'm going to say it, because I think it should be done. It's utterly irrelevant where he got the information and why he did it, he revealed someone's personal information without consent. He should be permanently banned. This is *my* view, it's perfectly valid and you get to disagree with it if you want, but you do *not* get to silence it with your utterly fucking retarded bullshit notion that only CCP gets to have an opinion on the matter. 
---
Fuck *right* off, you unfathomable fuck.
---
In b4 NCPL take over branch and dek to rent out
---
downvote because lumpy
---
This is an all time list the way I understand it, so for the older groups yes there is some math involved and you can only see averages, but for new groups on the list you can see them only being here for 1-2 years and still being a large percentage of bans during that time.
---
CCP stats show who got reported and banned for botting.
---
It doesn't show who is botting where. "Soft access" regions also harbor a lot of bots. [Here](https://twitter.com/GoldOlmeca/status/1126748306065899522) is my response to Memettani to save the repeat.
---
PS: There needs to be more NPC stations (gates won't solve anything), and better yet NPC citadels, to serve as staging points for people who'd make null a little more unsafe for everyone including botters.
---
Oops I’m too dumb at Reddit to change it.
---
Sort and Rick are both retarded shitheads so it's hard to want to help one of them.
---
Duuude
---
twitter was not made for an essay you savage
---
Fairs but we know Sort is a bigger one by far
---
I constantly state that there should be more NPC pockets with 1-2 NPC stations (not citadels) and those pockets **need** to have gate access to lowsec area or be in direct capital jump range of NPC space.       
---
Why i am asking for lowsec gate to Stain?        
---
So people can move and affect area around stain - you can no longer move in to Stain with capital force by NPC route.
---
&gt;Pretty much the only thing I can think of that removes isk from the game is people quitting or being banned.
---
I believe the tax we pay for trading in NPC stations like in Jita is another way to remove isk.
---
Modern Germany was pretty much with American money in the rebuild after ww2, go read up on it as it is very very very Interesting to read about in the 20years following the German defeat.
---
&gt;I can find my own hole
---
Yes, yes you can
---
The only Germans I know who get upset about holocaust memorials are part of the afd (the far right party in Germany).
---
Snuff is notoriously friendly with ncdotte
---
They were docking, obviously ;)
---
Rather you are under „too big to fail“ protection.
---
Build titans and supers?
---
In general I'm not opposed to more connectivity. Except perhaps you're demanding too much for CCP to be willing to change. More staging points/stations might be a more tangible approach than changing the very geographic way of how systems connect to each other.
---
They will seek greener pastures before long.
---
Most underrated response.
---
Every region accessible by lowsec maybe?
---
The average IQ of the praise bob server is now restored to double digits. Stop posting please.
---
Snackaroth, miss you buddy.
---
They have the most players in the game. Naturally, they have a lot of the nicest people but a lot of the worst people as well.
---
'Mittani with the wizard hat at fanfest' is the EVE Subreddits Godwin's Law, jeez.
---
i mean. he is good at something.  
---
hes so good that there is a immortal identity to him in game
---
Or just... do away with that whole CSM thing? Who even cares at this point? Im sure that the CSM itself thinks its extremely important that they get flown to Iceland to talk about a videogame like it matters, but Eve's on the decline and any real decisions aren't made by these clowns, obviously.
---
nice
---
Looks like i missed something in my off time... can I get some Kontext ?
---
If he goes on your pre-populated Goon ticket then he'll get on the CSM again.
---
It is not about moving capitals to hostile space it is about opening space.         
---
Again example in Stain and around it.          
---
To attack Esoteria you need to grind all regions leading to it ... but before the jump range nerfs you could just do it from Stain side.         
---
This is not possible now as you can get easily cut off from logistic lines as there is single route for JF that can be locked out and if you wish to bring more ships or allies to the fight - you need to move by a lot of sov systems.      
---
Single gate and NPC route it creates change a lot.             
---
You also state that "it don't show who is actually botting" ... like WTF             
---
It actually shows who is botting as people get reported/chased by CCP all the times.       
---
This data shows who and where is being caught for botting.
---
Moreover, you could just as readily interpret it as a stance **with** the Chinese people - all the victims were Chinese students - but **against** the Chinese government.
---
Remember that. People - **good**. Authoritarian, arguably fascist government - **bad**.
---
My dream is : each region having at least one NPC route to lowsec.     
---
So a region connected to NPC nullsec and this nullsec to lowsec is also fine.
---
\&gt; if target opponent has a card with that name in their hand they exile it.
---
What if you have two of that name? The wording is a bit ambiguous.
---
But no more range bonus on the draugur
---
Ah! I had been wondering about that. CCP Round strikes again, and all makes sense.
---
Disbanding an Alliance shouldn't be done. All it would accomplish is removing content from the game, and force all the non-bot players to join other alliances and further the blue donut effect. I agree that the leaders of alliances should be punished in some way for harbouring bots, but disbanding an alliance is doing more harm than good for the game IMO.
---
Just BTW (honest here) i am totally amused by this data as it shows that "Goons are the **good guys here** constantly fighting the groups that are harboring botters"         
---
This is just amazing for a simple fact how much denial it generates from the people that always assumed that they are the 'good guys'.
---
Good post. Get out.
---
The "50% range bonus" was wrongfully placed where 50% mwd radius bonus should be
---
CCP just fixed this on SISI and gave Draugur a flat speed buff
---
Name-calling and false accusations. You sir, need to feel the banhammer.
---
I dont like that because it sounds like it would take more jumps than necessary to get to target systems. Roaming already takes way too long for too little reward.
---
They just don't have to throw allegations around while removing someone...
---
I am a SJW. This isn't racist.
---
Doomhamster when?
---
&gt; It actually shows who is botting as people get reported/chased by CCP all the times.
---
"Soft access" botters are harder to discern and seldom get reported. When it's 4 VNIs in a system ratting for 20 hours a day it's easy to tell for many people. When it's 4 VNIs and a constantly changing combination of Rorquals, supers, DED ratters etc around in a system then they blur in the crowd. Happens a lot in Delve.
---
In just 1 month of afk camping we cleaned 8+ bot supers in Delve. None of them got banned. I know many hunters not even reporting them because they are good kills for people with blue eyes or afk campers.
---
My mistake was focusing too much on my own activities and thinking Delve was the greatest bot harbor atm. Now it looks more to me like most alliances are in this race to the bottom; "everyone is doing it so why shouldn't we". Bots farm for months until they get outed, and then only a small fraction of them actually get reported, and a fraction of them get banned. And that's what you're seeing in Peligro's data.
---
To my knowledge GotG isn't an Imperium member. It will probably be OK
---
Ha
---
Trying to be a retarded PC SJW
---
Not in order the ones I can remember are:
---

Harbinger Khanid

Hadean horror for the logistics frigate that I can't remember the name of
---
Gate to stain when?
---
On a more related thing : Reaching  Dronelands is and was a PITA very few people would go there since getting there is a chore (40min in a somewhat decent pvp ship)  then the bots would just evade you anyway. Hard to get a fight....
---
You just want a lowsec gate to stain...
---
Every bit of sisi news I'm hoping for more info on what's coming. It's less than 3 weeks to release, and all we know is; Incursion, Gate deactivation, mining boosts and cyno jam, oh and big fuck off ship that the triglavian read a naglfar blueprint sideways.
---
Re-read what they said, bud.
---
&gt; Botter empires didn't really come back strong after fozzie sov(which was made in part to break up the stagnant botter empires) until they removed passive moons. Then all the big retards were scurrying to find a replacement for passive income.
---
They're saying that between Aegis and Moon Fracking, bot empires weren't really there. I'm not sure I personally agree, but still.
---
You are 100% correct you have the right to an opinion. You even are correct in voicing that opinion. I just think it's a bit over the top to call for a permaban, or any ban really. It's CCPs job to determine what, if any, punishment should be given. 
---
We all have biases which affect our point of view. The only thing I completely disagree with you on is this. This particular fuck can in fact be fathomed.
---
Saves us effort, we wanna be spoon fed content now :D
---
Your Tristan should be tripple blue for the best standings tank, Neutral's going to get you nowhere, people still shoot those
---
context?
---
No it doesn't. 
---
I think of the killing of indigenous people when I hear the word holocaust.
---
What happened in WWII was horrific but it doesn't somehow give anyone control of the language or the authority to change/define it.
---
Well the issue is that breaking such a thing could potentially break the ability to undock, or to log in.
---
I'm largely surprised there is no gate mentioned in this post whatsoever
---
This is a good post.
---
But how do you know. Better to kill them all and let BOB sort them out
---
Well ... welcome to fade and deklein ... everytime you see a gemini whale united guy ... you can assume it's a bot ... that whole alliance is nothing more then a bot-haven. Now just imagine you would move more to the north to Ranger Regiment home-space ... my god you would kill probably 10 supers per day :D
---
Hello NC alt!
---
I don't do metagame or politics to have good or bad guys.
---
People like you are in the business of politics and choosing sides. I am in the business of killing ships. That's what I play for.
---
So when Peligro's data shows me no Imperium bots naturally I am skeptical. Not because I am on the other team, but because unlike you I am the one in the field. And when I say there are botters I link videos, link killmails, link entire threads about them in which we made people kick tens of bots who've been ratting in there for a year.
---
So when Peligro's data is shown to me I try to reconcile my own experience and data and his. One way to do it is thinking about how many "soft access" region bots actually get reported. And the other is the quicker account turnover (bots farm a year, get outed, get kicked, get banned but isn't counted "imperium" because it wasn't in the alliance when the ban occurred).
---
It's not denial. It's actually being in a better position about this to know more than you do.
---
Is that not his point?
---
CCP do not make changes to New Eden's Geography. Sorry
---
Get rid of the CSM already
---
You chose the correct skin, now keep that baby nice and clean and fly her with pride.
---
Uranus.. giggdy
---
Ok so let me say how i see it.            
---
Bots like desolate renter regions because :        
---
* less movement - less changing variables you need to worry       
---
* private systems - you don't have to worry about other players (not only doing the sites but also trying to interact with you)            
---
So places like drone space or big part of angel space ... or stuff like deep paragon soul (but not only) - but not places like goons delve where there is always someone else doing the same anomaly.         
---
I can be wrong, but i think that highly populated area is a last place you want to put in your bot.
---
if Frat still hold sov on june 4th perhaps you guys can start an invasion. we can call it "The 30 Years War".
---
This! Tiananemen events were done by Chinese to Chinese so race wasn't in the equation. Whoever is offended by its mention should find another word to describe it.
---
CCP did multiple changes to New Eden's Geography over the years.
---
And missed a very important one. \*winks\*
---
so?
---
&gt;I mean naming it that is at the very least antagonistic
---
only if you are part of the authoritarian government that had those people killed.
---
1) Only benefit from researching in NPC station is that nothing will actually stop your job as NPC stations kinda cant be killed, but they are unbonused so they are slow.
---
2) No pros and i believe it cant be even done now. The significant difference between complexes and POSes is that cant lose BPOs from complex. All your assets (this isnt true for WHs) are moved into asset safety upon complex destruction and get available for small fee after 30d. You will lose only progress.
---
3) Usually higher indexes meaning greater taxes, i do research low tier BPOs there for market purposes. Its significantly slower then null tho. You just need to remember that your progress can be lost if structure is destroyed or the structure owner just decide to end support of given complex.
---
4) You need to check industry window, you really aim for research rigged azbel.
---
5) Yes, actually quite significant improvement from HS. The gasp between Hs an LS is larger then LS and Null
---
TL;DR If you feel ok hauling BPOs to LS, find rigged Azbel there and use it.
---
For a moment I thought i was on /r/magicthecirclejerking or /r/custommagic ...  quite surprising to see this here lol
---
Its your meme.  Just roll with it
---
You guys coming south now? Slyce are bros since wicked creek anyway.
---
It's almost as playing EVE itself is a "loss of money" and "loss of time". Who would've thought!
---
Giving a literal definition is the lowest form of argument, especially when it is very clear when used in a non-defined context it is referring to the WW2 holocaust. This is no different to the iamverysmart playground argument of "gay" meaning "happy" etc.
---
[I dunno what to say so here is a Chinese meme](http://imgur.com/a/yPnp6JM)
---
Now imagine yourself having a gate from lowsec to middle of the drone lands ... to a constellation with 2 NPC stations.     
---
Your route just got so much shorter and now you can move in in there with few friends and using few hunter chars move around and look for target to kill.         
---
Because you are moving - intell is full of you and bots 2-3 jumps from your locations are docked ... and will be docked for like 10-15minutes after you move away.           
---
There are multiple people like you, and 23/7 "up time" on bots just changed to 10/7 - so significant reduction.        
---
You know what? You actually kill a lot of those bots and thanks to your reports many of them are banned in much faster than before.
---
the funny thing is you think he loves ISK. he loves dollars. ISK is just something to RMT.
---
Then I believe I die sir.
---
No they didn't this was not the issue before as Stain was reachable using capital force - this changed the moment jump range nerf was introduced.
---
There is no direct connection between that post and the new renting model by Goons.  
---
Actually, that new model is kinda botting unfriendly, as you have less money (compared to simply buying a system and letting a lot of bots running 23/7) and encourages more player engagements (coordinating the anomalies etc.)
---
It's a matter of personal choice of the botter.
---
Remote regions have the advantage of... being remote. It's nice. Lots of people do it this way. There are vast regions of space with only VNI bots to go for.
---
Places like Delve has the umbrella as a deterrent. So people don't drop on your supercap bot, or even come to your region, to begin with. Even if they drop, the defense fleet kills their dreads etc. But then these regions have a few autists like us afk camp (or blue spy) their systems for months and observe people's behavior to try to score kills.
---
All in all I think they are more evenly distributed than you think or what Peligros data shows.
---
Now again, I'm not opposed to more connectivity except it might be too invasive to change the entire mobility geography of Eve. That increases overall null risk. But really that won't cause more bots to die. You can have as much connectivity as you want. Everyday lots of wormholers roll into botlands and try and score a kill. Local is the main thing between bots which are already fully aligned and these people. And I did argue for a local delayed ship before.
---
You're the one using semantics. We all know the word holocaust generically refers to mass murder. However, we also know what the word means in a real world context, ie. the context that 99% of the English speaking world thinks of when the word is used without a qualifier. Being a dictionary warrior is not clever.
---
2% of Kids with guns is far more disturbing. They have been around and botting forever
---
There's still a 15% optimal bonus per level.
---
That moment when you get tackled and webbed by a haw dread...
---
Goons vote logically for whoever suits their interests, as they should.  There's no reason he wouldn't make it onto their prefilled ballot again, with a glowing list of reasons for inclusion.  It is basically the same as being elected already because of the in-fighting and fragmentation of the rest of the playerbase, so it's a vote worth courting for him, by promising whatever it takes.  Goons *and* the Chinese contingent = re-election, and free trips to Iceland.  More audience for the inevitable GoFundMe as well.
---
+1
---
The social control Chinese citizens are subject to is appalling.
---
I see one flaw in your statement.         
---
**Bots don't cry for help**      
---
As for connectivity is about increase player movement, bots don't like neutrals in the systems and vicinity - they dock and stay docked for a while.
---
How thick is your tinfoil hat?
---
The fact that you spotted a bot or two in imperium space means nothing compared to the data that was given out.
---
EVERYONE has had a bot active within them at some point, we just appear to have the lowest amount of bots that were banned, is it that hard of a pill to swallow?
---
Print 'F'
---
&gt; Bots don't cry for help
---
The advantage of the umbrella space is not that bots go on teamspeak, light a cyno, and ask for a counterdrop.
---
It's that the umbrella is so strong, that most people don't even hunt in that space to begin with. And those who do don't go for bots that immediately warp off when neutral comes in local. There are several (real-person) supers who don't warp off. So the only people who can actually kill bot supers in umbrella space is people with blue alts or afk campers. That's pretty narrow a list believe it or not.

You post like trump tweets

Another feature that will not be added to wormholes... and that is good :D f\* agency

Unknown the direction we shall go at this time
---
It's still early days alliance command still need to come up with options with the future
---
yall need to step up your game tbh
---
Nah, but I assume they are good at basic maths. Like "Landlord wants Z ISK a month. It d cost me X hrs a month (which d translate to Y ISK at my usual income)to fend off an angry ex-landlord.  If Y is substantially lower than Z, fuck that guy."
---
He doxxed  that's a big no no on this community should be banned and blacklisted
---
Theres clear evidence he has so if CCP dont do anything then this is dodgy as fuck
---
you made it :D good stuff
---
There is NO chinese race, it is the chinese people, consisting of the race homo sapiens sapiens, that has over several 10k years created several phenotypes that are an adaption to the temperatures, sun intensity and geography of their home region. Stop speaking of races, THATS racist, and educate yourselves .... *facepalming* *ashamed of the worlds stupidity*
---
Spod bless you for showing me this great video
---
&gt; EVERYONE has had a bot active within them at some point, we just appear to have the lowest amount of bots that were banned, is it that hard of a pill to swallow?

---
[This corp](https://zkillboard.com/corporation/98517701/) has botted in Imperium space in 20+ VNIs and 10+ Nyxes for over a year. Until it was made by us and then kicked by Wibla for feeding.
---
Most characters in there are reported and not permabanned.
---
So tell me more about how permaban statistics shows your space has the lowest amount of bots.
---
If you roam your space a little, you'll see many VNI accounts never ceasing to farm. And thanks to Delve being too crowded to discern, we don't know super bots for years until we decide to go for an afk camping campaign and observe them actively. Is it too unreasonable to suggest, just maybe, you have many more corporations like "The.Ring" in your space?
---
Mine is not a tinfoil hat. It is experience speaking. And yours is a zealous irrational commitment of your space cult being the "good guys".
---
It's quite funny really an American using some darkish humor and an aussie gets offended please tell me how the hell that works  lol
---
Ok but what about all the people in delve, for sure they have issues that when they warp to anomaly someone is there already.        
---
I don't think that this kind of downtime for bots is acceptable - because a supper bot in delve will make less isk than a T2 carrier bot in the renter space.
---
Good for you, SLYCE.
---
pretty sure the unique weapon, multirole posibilities, style and production materials are unique enough
---
Not by what he wrote but meh, just pointing out that it's really interesting story of the rebuilding of germany.
---
to be fair... "Manny is the cause for all that is shit in eve" should be the true Godwin's Law

Imagine being ultra-orthodox in 2019
---
Weak statement with weak arguementation.
---
Burn everything. Ash is the best fertilizer!
---
Most bots do warp to the next site if there is a blue in the anomaly when they land.
---
There were hilarities we witnessed like a bot malfunctioning, warping to someone else's anomaly, the dude being mad in local, the bot not listening etc.
---
Sweeping it under the carpet and trying to make people forget all those people who had died there - that is mocking.
---
Reminding everyone that it had indeed happened and we do remember those who fell - is the only right thing to do.
---
Papa roach?
---
Trig ships are strong enough, no thanks they don't need other niches
---
Leave your crazy ideas to future shiplines
---
Dang. What's your fit for that Muninn?
---
yeah, it's a niche usecase for single players with multiple accounts in for example lower class farmholes, to get around when dreads are not used, however all PvP oriented groups use Citadels as bases.
---
You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.

It was updated yesterday, pyfa build with these changes: [https://github.com/pyfa-org/Pyfa/releases/tag/v2.9.4dev1](https://github.com/pyfa-org/Pyfa/releases/tag/v2.9.4dev1)
---
A for Effort
---
why the fuck does this exist
---
There are a shit ton of videos on yt. If you want a tutorial experience, may I suggest you get on Twitch and watch shit live. Evelog is my favourite but BjornBee is good also.
---
Shield actually, 720s, abyss xlasb+extender, sig rolled mwd against fighters and two nanos, i've outrun interceptors and tracked them perfectly while they chase me, love the speed.
---
I tried finding one yesterday, but i can't find it anywhere, not in the market, search, ship tree, or fitting simulation, it seems like you can't get one anymore.
---
The fastest ship in the game i can certainly confirm that it is the Gold Magnate, it can go up to over 13k with implants.
---
As for number 2 for warp speed, ut goes to a special edition shuttle called the Leopard @ 20 AU/s
---
Cargo capacity (number 13) besides the Cockroach the top spot goes to the Charon @ over 1 million m3
---
And another thing, in you post at number 18, what do you mean by "faxes"? I can't find any ship in the game even remotely close to that name, but i did find a prototype exploration ship called Zephyr that has extremely low signature radius, is very light, and the best part about it, wormhole sleepers will not attack it, which is quite interesting
---
You mean SLYCE got kciked for nothing under a pretence of "something said in poor taste", but in reality to protect these very botters here?
---
Other than that - whoosh? =\]
---
love the music choice
---
Bad AutoModerator!
---
I tried see if I could fit a 4x Warp Stab Astero explorer. Power &amp; CPU couldn't handle more than 2 stabs.
---
is there a good reason for all the bling but t1 rigs/ t1 repairer?
---
It's not "thousands", it's at least a million in recent history.  Probably many multiples thereof if you extend the time window slightly.
---
I mean, I'm not saying the last two years make the majority. But I still think that way more people have been banned in 2018/2019 than 2006/2007. Wouldn't be surprised if more people have been banned for botting the last year than bots existing in 2006. If only because the average number of alts has probably skyrocketed since then. Way easier to set up a bot farm as well now thanks to skill injectors.
---
Might be just my impression of course.
---
If you ever want a decent/fun fight pass by catch, all the other Brave regions, the cap nerds will pretty much always drop on you..
---
And a bit more then that. Owned like 1/3rd of the map (if not more).
---
"When I realized it was his RL name" What the fuck did you think it was you imbecile? His drug dealing alias? Do you take the entire EVE community for fools?
---
I need to raise my standing with Kaalakiota to improve my reprocessing of ores, how do I do that in the most efficient way?
---
exactly
---
I noticed that there’s Triglavian jumpgate blueprint or something like that, could that be something something?
---
Dirt would be an upgrade.
---
Naw. CCP isn't afraid to push our shit in. They do it all the time in patch notes. :V
---
Been advocating that for years!
---
It seems like every alliance leader is shitty in one way or another.
---
Standing up to a fascist state which will execute you if you resist is the height of bravery, I doubt you have even a quarter of the balls those Chinese students did.
---
3 or 4
---
It's funny that you listed them from weakest to strongest but from the first three, only Blades is still alive in winter co. MOA and KOS died.
---
It cannot block CSM's doomday tho
---
&gt; You think I'm anti-Goon, but that's only because I've been killing their ships, and they have lots to kill, and I argued killing ships should be made easier for 3 years, and they gave me a lot of hate for all that. I'm still not anti-Goon. I am pro-explosions.
---
No, people think you are anti-goon because of your frothing posts about how goons are actively out to get you
---
what are you talking about?? NC are currently deployed to save BOT space, how does that not mean much?
---
He doxxed someone, because their corp was calling out botters in the alliance, in an edgy way.
---
Nonstop ratting ticks 23.75 hours a day are a pretty big giveaway.
---
But the bot can send an alert to it's user to come back to the computer.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVekJTmtwqM
---
I see whats happening here - get CCP into the habit of creating new gate connections... next thing we know... Stain gate...
---
On a serious note though, we all know what a hassle it can be to roam the drone regions - so much so that the other day after about 20 jumps with a pal we just gave up and headed towards Geminate. Couple of NPC stations well placed would go a long way toward facilitating more roaming and therefore less botting.
---
I approve of this suggestion!
---
Needs a speech bubble on the ship as it slides above the telescope, going "Meep meep"
---
Wow that's bad..
---
me like - make more short fun/meme ones
---
Do you know how fast super dies to bunch of dreads or swarm of bombers?      
---
1 siege cycle and you are gone.
---
I'm confused. It looks like you are fleet killing?
---
I get what you're saying, but given the distances involved, the chance of that debris/ordnance *not* getting pulled into a celestial with the required gravity mass makes this even less likely to happen.
---
Sounds like in a week people are going to avoid the entire thing like a lot of other stuff patched in thru the years.
---
I can only applaud your and XtraSquishy's efforts to put some joy into videos about PvP in Eve.
---
&gt;I started Eve online back when it had been running for a year or so. It's been a while.
---
Well that would have been 15 years ago.
---
&gt;I want to be a miner. I ran into an issue with not being able to protect my mining rig from npc pirates I think? I can't remember.
---
Well there are dedicated mining ships now, so as long as you fit them properly you shouldnt see them destroyed by NPCs but other players might try to kill you.
---
Explain why it would take more jumps that it does now? All that's being proposed is a pocket of systems going from conquerable null to NPC faction. No redesign of gates is being proposed (except for Stain but that's a meme now-a-days).
---
Also if roaming is taking you too long to find content you need to learn how to use Dotlan and see system activity and go from there. That problem is between the keyboard and the chair, not the game
---
No he literally typed it in alliance chat while being livestreamed.
---
The changed a load of links in high sec, in and around Jita for example.
---
I forsee subsequent chapters being forgotten in favour of something else, leaving the feature half completed, while they dangle something else totally different at us.
---
The hac still on has 23km with long range t2 ammo loaded with all of my skills maxed. That is ridiculous.
---
Always alot of action there it seems like when I am going through.  Why is it such a popular system?
---
That - yes, but have they touched nullsec?
---
I lost a billion in one go due to a typo and mashing Yes on the "Are you sure? That trade is a bit mad" button. I only lost 1 billion due to the orders set up. I could have potentially lost 4.
---
I'm sure I've gained approx 1 billion due to other players typoes too.
---
For the record: I would **not** refund a typo from anyone else's mistake.
---
How's it feel to have 16% of the botters banned in your rental empire? Are you going to be eating humble pie or doubling down?
---
This is true, but they are Russian-owned alliances that are allowing the botting. In my experience they usually have a lot of Russians in Russian rental alliances and others are in the minority... but it is perfectly possible this isn't the case in all cases.
---
Kamigawa has some fans... I think that's too generous for sort.
---
Don't cut yourself on that edge.
---
u/ccp_peligro
---
I have word from people in my group that infiltrated bot-heavy groups to kill/drop bots, that their spy chars all got bulk-banned, although they havent undocked in 6 weeks and all they can fly is a T1 Frig with a cyno.
---
Is it possible that you took the low effort approach of bulk-banning all chars of some corps just because you identified some of them botting?
---
No shit... After looking at the collection of halfway bigger null-groups in existance I decided to live in HS and burn my riches there wardeccing random "baddies". Sounded like more fun...
---
Meti...? \*TRIGGERED\*
---
And it's impossible for those guys to not be bots because.... you say so?
---
Peligro doing god's work, but somehow missed a whole botting only region - where KWG live.
---
Alexa can tell this from the sounds the keyboard makes ... additionally to your mental state &amp; health
---
Yeah we dont need a sort dragon gate.
---
But why the hell protect botter and kick real player? ...
---
I just want superhighways connecting allied empires capital systems, (Luminaire &lt;---&gt; Pator) for example. Would make some sense.
---

Any information on the ledger is stored in local databases and the information provided upon user registration is only used for the sole purpose of the website functionality.
---
It is absurd to think  that the information stored would be used within the site for any other use that intended.
---
If i did use the information on the site other than its intended function, the user base would lose faith with the project and would kill it.
---
I do not use any information on the site provided by the user base for anything other than intended. 
---
So therefore I can confirm I am not using the information to hunt rorquals!
---
Searching where someone live and threaten to cut his hands is worst imo. Ccp should investigate on sort dragon case and hopefully we can trust their decision
---
Nice story!
---
insane how some fking pixel can give you an adrenaline rush like that, right?   
---
I know no other game that can do this faster - and i dont wanna know how much spodbrains already got an heartatack because a sabre warped on them and they forgot to anchor a mobile depot
---
meh, i guess this stems from the contoversy around the Berlin holocaust memorial. some people weren´t satisfied with the build quality, basic conceptual style and later on maintenance regarding the money that was spend. So technically there were indeed people getting upset about holocaust memorials. Just for different reasons than you would think.
---
not their renters though.
---
How the absolute fuck does that have any fucking connection to botting in eve
---
If I remember right he didn't say don't. Report them. It was "report them to our leaders and we will investigate our self." Or something bloke that.
---
Basically they what to confirm it them self. Rather then just having random members report for nothing.
---
But the legitimacy off a bit report should be down to CCP not them.
---
How does it feel falling for such obvious flairbait?
---
Wellllll ....fuck :)
---
Are you lost?
---
Uhh
---
They added the drone regions as a start, since they weren't accessible in the beginning (or didn't exist, I don't remember).
---
The two NPC constellations in Delve weren't there to begin with.
---
There was no lowsec connection to Delve until a few years after launch.
---
Certain regional gates did not exist initially (C-N &lt;-&gt; KVN comes to mind)
---
Fantastic.
---
you mean feeding to frat?

Fair enough. Then an ofshoot of 'The Society' or Triglavians somewhere in Botlands might not be a ad idea.

New phone, who dis?

Publically denying the holocaust as part of antidemocratic political and civic engamgement that goes against constitutional law is forbidden. You can talk about how Hitler did nothing wrong and the 3rd Reich was zee fuckin best all you want otherwise.

Exploring Data &amp; Relic sites in Null is quite lucrative.
---
Watch out for Ghost sites &amp; Covert sites. They explode 60 seconds after landing. I lost an Astero by being sloppy and not double checking.
---
I would be nervous about doing combat sites due to the fact that you are on D-Scan for an extended amount of time in null or WHs.
---
As for exploring in WHs, if you see any other ships or probes on D-scan likelyhood is if you ignore them you will reget it when a hunter decloaks next to you. I always stick to Null and cloak up whenever someone appears in local.
---
WTB Band 2
---
The last thing you wrote was correct (more NPC stations or NPC citadels).  Everywhere in null should be at least withing dread range of an NPC station. 
---
Your initial armwaving though, flying the face of evidence, detracts from this.
---
It’s not just olmecca that finds these bots. His observations are corroborated by many other campers over several weeks of observing consistent botting behavior.
---
Most systems are quite densely packed too.  With anom respawn times you'd be an idiot to bot in Delve rather than, say, renting somewhere in the back and beyond for yourself.
---
Your lies are getting quite ridiculous.
---
I'm sure Sort's mum is proud of him.
---
Great flavour and interesting design, but a couple of notes if you want it to be worded like an actual MTG card: the first ability should read "Creature with the greatest power" (see [Crackling doom](https://images.app.goo.gl/3UCJzNy1HFEiNG328)) and your opponent would have to reveal their hand for the second ability. It would read something like "name a card. Target opponent reveals their hand and exiles all cards with the chosen name" (see [Cabal therapist](https://images.app.goo.gl/MRPeH2rYQ2hTYMWY8)). You probably also want to make it "name a nonland card", as it seems to be a rule not to print discard spells that hit lands. Look forward to seeing more from you!
---
Just checking KB. Looks anti Goon. Might just look back through previous posts and see if you have claimed to be making reference to Goon botters or AFK players. If this appears to be so, and is one of the reasons (I am sure there are several) then the data would show you as anti goon, as botting appears to be much higher in rental regions. 
---
BTW I miss the dread bombs, please come back.
---
The difference between this and Brisc is twofold - 1. ACCUSATIONS were made against Brisc with no actual evidence. The onus was then on CCP to find evidence. There is no need to get her evidence here as Sort did this publically. 2. Brisc was accused of using CSM knowledge to make in game isk, scummy to be sure, but doxxing is waaaayyyyyy scummier.
---
Oh I know. I’m head of HR. USQU was a fantastic acquisition. Glad to get them as far away from Sort as possible.
---
Remind me what happened to the guy who did that on stage? Oh right, he was removed from his CSM position.
---
Well eve's entertainment value does depend on a length of a pole between you and people trying to make your stuff disappear in the most boring manner possible.
---
He is also the kind of guy making a post per month where he explain over 60+ line how retarded he is and how much he hate goons...
---
&gt;I don't think he intentionally did it.
---
He tripped and fell on his 'post private information about an in game player' key?
---
Remember when they added the whole of Black Rise?
---
That's messed up dawg. I would be ok if it populated as you traveled through space, but it showing everything off the bat is a bit much.
---
your graphic card is dieing RIP
---
Everything shown ahs the doxxing censored because reposting it here uncensored will catch you a permaban on Reddit.
---
He was asking how I assigned alliances to coalitions who had been part of many. NA and Tangra have always been affiliated with panfam, so it doesn't impact them.
---
How is mentioning a historical event racist now.
---
The statistics say otherwise.
---
*Alliance in their coalition
---
Fixed it for you
---
Open up these regions with a new NPC space as access. Not only will allow botting to become more difficult due to increased traffic and hostile ships being able to move with more ease, but you will have entities being able to take space easier as they will have options to stage throughout this NPC space to take SOV. 
---
As it currently is you have to stage in lowsec and this makes it nigh on impossible to take or move anything to get to some of these regions. Made even more difficult by the fact that these entities that currently occupy most of this space all have agreements to keep this space safe so the botter ISK keeps rolling in.
---
We could sleep (stage) on SLYCE’s couch :)
---
I was in bit of a rush getting all since wh is closing...
---
And I did check contract, isk for bp, all right!
---
damn are you telling me that whoever rents the majority of space gets the majority of bans for botting
---
tell me more about it sounds like a very smart conclusion that nobody thought about it before
---
You're right, you probably know more about this than most retards on this sub do, but you don't know more of it than Peligro and the rest of CCP, must have some serious problems to trust subjective experiences and misinformation over official objective statements from the people who have all the answers
---
Brisc was accused of CSM Knowledge abuse because he sold a faction titan shortly before huge titan nerfa were announced, I believe.
---
Mittens caught a 30 day ban for a first offense.
---
I’d say the regular way is to simply run missions with Kaalakiota agents. This can take quite some game time if you already have really low standings with either the corporation itself or the Caldari States.
---
You can also train up the Social and Connections skills, they will allow you to basically get free standings as they train up. DO NOT TRAIN THEM IF YOU ALREADY HAVE NEGATIVE STANDINGS ! They won’t affect the standings with hostile factions. If you’re below zero with the Kaalakiota corporation or the Caldari States, you need to train the Diplomacy skill first.
---
Finally, running "Data Center" missions will also fix your standings and push them up. You can find more here : https://www.thonky.com/eve-online-guide/dog-tags
---
Hope this help !
---
How? Its literally every second comment. People are way less mad about the 'don't report botters' shit than the 'doxxing a dude' shit.
---
Always read fine print.
---
If you want to throw away faction battleships you can give them to me.
---
Yeahhhh... i think i'll just go for a BC or even for a gila since I already have one.. thanks for the fit
---
The Judge: I stole a keepstar and destroyed an entire alliance single handedly. Vote for me!

Brisc: Hold my.. Wait, it wasn't me. No collusion, vote for me! 
---
FortDragon: "Hold my Kirkland Bar flavour Panda-Pop!"
---
No one is accusing them. It's raising awareness to a generation that is probably ignorant of what actually happened because the Chinese Communist Party has effectively erased the event from history inside of China.

Yeah... So the small groups in Dronelands, are f***** and you force them to become renters...

Hell no.

While I fully support all and any QoL changes that make playing EVE more pleasant, reducing the performance gap between putting a lot of effort into getting an advantage and just playing without caring much. Sadly, by adding QoL changes there is no compensation in terms of gap between the base of what's freely handed to you, and what you can exploit out of the system/game having solid preparation, knowledge, intel, setup etc. So no, not dozens of probes required to scan different types signatures, but instead dozens of probes that can be used to scan different types of signatures and are heavily bonused towards that.
---
And this new agency addition goes into exactly the wrong direction - if it was instead a map filter with "average amount of signatures in system over last hour", it would be great tool - still useful if you just open the map and look at it for a bit (where to fly for datas/relics), but for active effective use requiring you to constantly watch and spam that filter and analyze the results on your own (mark timings etc).
---
One thing I can suggest is to use the impetus potency whatever booster to help speed up raising the standing
---
They can view? TIL.
---
This is bad.
---
going from 40% to 60% resist is NOT +20% resists. It's +20 percentile points, which is NOT the same. If you add two modules with 50% resists and there is no stacking penalty, you won't have 100% resists but 75% resists instead.
---
So whatever is your resist, the addition of a 50% resist layer (which actually multiplies your resonance by 1-50/100 = 0.5 ) will ALWAYS provide the same ehp multiplier (ie \*2) and a +20% resist will ALWAYS provide a 1.25 ehp multiplier.
---
The only really triggering thing about this image is that you did not have enough isk to buy it.
---
Not really though, they're only loosely correlated and the stats for *active* botters could be wildly different.

You wont really find a one stop shop for learning Eve in a video format.  Just google for specific guides when you find something you want to learn.

My opinion sums it like this:  Eve has its own "common sense" that can really only be learned from other players.  Its all the little bits of information that make it really time consuming for a group of new players to learn by themselves. Personally, I learned the most sitting on comms in random conversations.  Some vet drops the holy grail of info without a second thought.  Nothing to him, but a newbro lights up like a beacon of hope as things start to align into understanding.  
---
The best option is joining a group with a commitment to help new players become old players check out Pandemic Horde.  Others exist, but I did my research when I came back from break and have been here for close to 3 years now.
---
just randomize all the systems!
---
&gt; finding a C13  
---
Yeah that's easier said than done. Most people that run those camp them and at least have a scanning alt to find their way back in.
---
He didn't dox anyone. Also. You're a retard.
---
Personally I think the Dronelands have their Achilles Heel for wormholers.  Instead of a limited NPC base are (which could be kept under observation) you've got the high interconnectivity making it a lot easier to roll a hole in to "Drone Regions" than in to any other geographical block you may want to define.
---
Now it doesn't match the roaming style you want currently but it is an option which has worked well. The huge interconnection in terms of how the regions are jumbled together for jump ranges also made it a lot more viable to stage supercapitals in the area and use them to murder locals.
---
While it is null-sec I'd say it is a different play area from other null-sec and supporting different play styles similar to how null and WH space share a lot of mechanics but are very different.
---
maybe
---
Can you repeat the question?
---
There is excitement to be had in the big and small, administrative things are exciting for the few that can make it work , but administrators who just admin themselves are just jerking off. 
---
FC and PVP is the fast track to leadership ( like being in sales) mining is just managing yourself and not getting killed most of the time. 
---
You cans set up mining ops that might push yourself forward towards empire building and management.
---
You know that currently big part of drone lands is controlled by WH groups.        
---
Like you cannot hunt your renters.
---
So you are the mastermind behind all the bots in new eden. I’m on to your game
---
&gt;don't do metagame or politics to have good or bad guys.
---
Is it why you do a monthly "grr goons" post ?
---
&gt;People like you are in the business of politics and choosing sides. I am in the business of killing ships. That's what I play for. You think I'm anti-Goon, but that's only because I've been killing their ships, and they have lots to kill, and I argued killing ships should be made easier for 3 years, and they gave me a lot of hate for all that. I'm still not anti-Goon. I am pro-explosions.
---
How to introduce "I'm neutral" that's amazing, but keep in mind the first part "People like you are in the business of politics and choosing sides. I am in the business of killing ships" very important
---
&gt;So when Peligro's data shows me no Imperium bots naturally I am skeptical. Not because I am on the other team, but because unlike you I am the one in the field. And when I say there are Imperium botters I link videos, link killmails, link entire threads about them in which we made people kick tens of bots who've been ratting in there for a year (see twitter).
---
Here you are saying because you bush drones in delve 24/7 you have more right to decide who bot and who doesn't than CCP Peligro who have access to WAY more data than you, who log, scan rorq, bush, grab the loot and log off.
---
&gt;So when Peligro's data is shown to me I try to reconcile my own experience and data and his. One way to do it is thinking about how many "soft access" region bots actually get reported
---
So you mean drone land, a space with barely any life in here, where no one goes there to roam have more report than Delve the place with the most active player per system ?
---
&gt;And the other is the quicker account turnover (bots farm a year, get outed, feed ships, get kicked, get banned from the coalition but isn't counted "imperium" on Peligro's list because it wasn't in the alliance when the ban occurred).
---
Where is your narrative of goons keep botter and even protect them ? Are you going to argue with that edited video where Mittani explain to not report fellow goons because some legit bee were ban for no reason and it was a pain in the ass to get their account back (pretty much what happen to brisc etc recently btw). Like what you are saying is, Yes bot join goons but they get kick because of it (and not feeding, goons don't give a fuck about killboard it's 2019 and people still think goons is NCPL). So what's your problem ? Yes goons do not show any bot in their data BECAUSE we actively kick them out of the alliance BECAUSE we don't want bot, unlike group you work for, just saying
---
&gt;Idk about other people. But mine is not denial. It's actually being in a better position to know more about this than you do.
---
You know someone who know more about this than you ? CCP peligro data.  On a side note, "denial" is something that come back pretty often when you talk or when people talk about you, you should really work on this, understand why people say this about you and why everytime you post ~~shit~~ you have to say "Im neutral, I'm not working for the other side, Im not in denial" think about it buddy (oh wait, I'm stupid, you won't ever see this message because you mute anyone who put your head in your own shit and try to make you see how much in denial you are)
---
I am afraid that fire from my burning ass would have burned our galaxy then.
---
Well, I do too now.
---
Hehe, we have all been there. But losing an isk equivalent to a fully fitted Avatar would really suck hard. :D
---
Glad for you, mistake like that would probably have me ending with EvE and possibly destroying my computer in a fit of rage...
---
🤣 It’s not a problem for me for now as long as it is a clean exit.
---
Peligro gave us data about who was banned.
---
There are botters who aren't banned.
---
There are botters who don't ever get reported.
---
There are even botters who bot for a year, get kicked from alliance, then get banned.
---
It doesn't reflect any of that.
---
You are not basing your argument on CCP data. You are basing it on your interpretation of it.
---
I however am one of the people who hunts the botters. Of course I trust my experience more than your interpretation of CCP data.
---
Can someone explain this to me?
---
True, but when we are spamming local about Tiananmen I can understand why they might find it not nice. They don't have democracy, like we have. They don't have freedom of speech, like we have. Maybe they are watched, I don't know. I find it better to enter dialogue in a more peaceful way. And then we can inform them about these things when we established trust. Most of them werent even born when the massacre on Tiananmen Square happened. Bad behavior only leads to more bad behavior.
---
Oh it won't take more than a month.
---
PS: Goons recruited all stuff to kill so my kb is Goons. Wow shocking.
---
Lets count.
---
I remember the Honey Badger Coalition where he torpedoed their bromance with TEST+friends.  
---
Someone else fill more it, that was the only one I was present for.
---
Meh many botters are semi afk. A tanked super will have 2-3 minutes to light a cyno and get one fax. If the botter is close to the keyboard it's saved.
---
I remember being kicked from GOTG when I was in Blades of grass because we were not "active" enough.  
---
Some time later we were replaced by renters

---
do you know what also exists that you failed to mention?  
---
There are players that play like bots   
---
There are players that multibox like bots  
---
There are players as simple minded as bots  
---
There are even players that bot and then stop after a warning or temporary ban  
---
your interpretation doesn't affect any of that
---
You are not basing your argument on pure CCP data. You are basing it on your interpretation of it.
---
I however am one of the people who roam other places than delve, Of course I trust my experience more than your biased interpretation of CCP data.
---
Maybe it's been changed in the last 48 hours. Thanks for the heads up.
---
I think your hopes are unrealistically high for what local chat is like. But it's absolutely incorrect to claim bringing up Tiananmen Square is racist.
---
I took the advice and joined a large corp. In fact I did it 3 or 4 times just to give it a fair shot. Subsequently I don't play Eve Online anymore even though I have always wanted to. You just get trapped in null, roadblocked in all directions, with no assets or skills to join activities with others, no market to interact with, no idea who's who or whats going on, no sense of autonomy and a long boring wait for anything to actually happen while you sit ship spinning in a secluded station. And unless your social skills are good enough to make friends with foreigners quick then this is the endgame :)
---
I wouldn't suggest any player does this without at least being able to accumulate some ISK with a primary. In fact I might try that on my 4th/5th attempt (can't remember). Use only an ALT for nullsec stuff while the primary keeps you occupied during gap stages, as a last ditch effort.
---
In my experience setting up online groups not along the lines of shared values and goals (such as nationality, gender, race or such) ends badly.
---
Especially if it's centered around some minority group in a community, that gets infiltrated and ruined by the people who hate them and malign them right away.
---
Good luck on your venture tho i hope it works out this time for you.
---
Sort gunning down his own corpmates for speaking out against his botters. This sounds oddly similar to another event.
---
impressive !
---
Let me get this straight. You're saying the Alliances with high numbers are the good guys because they report botters more?
---
CCP releases data that shows that Goons aren't as bad as you've been claiming so you twist it into saying the data only shows that Goons don't report bots as much as... lets say Shadow of xXDEATHXx or Brothers of Tangra?

Well we have a nullsec static and a load of moons to mine. So we can mine, rat and explore like and more importantly roam.
---
Orignally the C1 was choosed as a protection since they (i wasn't there yet) were very little. Now, even if we could technically move it's not really worth the hassle and lot of assets would be lost.
---
That's a great heads up, I'll try my best to filter such stuff out if I can..
---
Our reasons for starting one is that some of us are often not that great at getting questions across in English and so sometimes end up getting more hate than answers on forums - like the newb I met did..

I would actually pay so much for an Eve commander precon..

Could have ships as Artifact Vehicles that need to be crewed perhaps..

There are a lot of tutorials on youtube, but Eve is such a vast game with many activities that you won't find a one stop shop for everything. I'll do my best to link some channels that might be able to help.  
---
[Rooks and Kings](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQi3Jf_jM-TcIZ6esDLZxAg) since you're part of that lore youtube group that recently came to Eve (welcome btw) we'll start with Rooks and Kings, they were a part of Eve's history and most players remember them for these videos that they put out. Though it's not a "tutorial" per se, it is a bit of an introduction to some of Eve's more famous player created history.  
---
[Jurius Doctor](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDn6Sk3JDa0wzme-T9wBfAA) has a lot of good videos for helping new players figure out how to get started.  
---
[Seamus Donohue](https://www.youtube.com/user/SeamusDonohueEVE) another player with a good assortment of newbro oriented videos.  
---
[Delonewolf](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHP3_2-6Zv5gAyFC5jto0CA) has also been mentioned here a few times and is a good channel to check out.  
---
[Suitonia](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa-ySys2dORr8gKx1-t9QAA) is a streamer who regularly flies pvp and posts pvp oriented videos on the EveIsEasy channel helping new and old players alike get better at flying pvp. This channel has fitting suggestions as well as suggestions on how to fly said ships.  
---
[Chessur](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1UGd7FHTg1tbHh6D5x4E3w) is another good pvp player, though he has since sold his character off and quit playing, his small gang archetype video series is a very good series to check out for pilots wanting to pvp in smaller groups. He also has some other good pvp videos worth checking out.  
---
[Eve University](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Main_Page) is an in-game corporation dedicated to teaching new players how to play the game, and their website has information on just about any subject relating to Eve you may want to know.  
---
[Agony Unleashed](https://wiki.agony-unleashed.com/index.php/Main_Page) may have closed their doors, and their fits and tactics listed on their site may be a bit dated, but there is still a lot of good information about how the ships/guns/etc. in Eve work.

I hope this list helps you out a bit.

Tbh not every 2 per region could be amazing thing.         
---
Why 2 - so people living in the area cannot make this place main staging ^(or put one next to it and perma bubble the station) thus locking operations of small groups.
---
This takes me back, love the content that comes out of this game
---
&gt; Let me get this straight. You're saying the Alliances with high numbers are the good guys because they report botters more?
---
Idk what in my post makes you say this.
---
&gt; Goons don't report bots as much as.
---
Goons aren't allowed to report.
---
But it's not that. The primary people who report are people who hunt these ships. Hunters roll in botlands. They only see vast spaces and regions of obviously botting VNIs. They get annoyed. Report.
---
Many hunters don't even go in Delve to begin with. Those who can actually hunt supers don't report bot supers, because they are juicy killmails. Those who randomly roam can't discern bot supers from real ones. And you can't tell whether VNIs are botters because Dotlan stats are obfuscated by real people (thats the main way to tell in other systems), and you can't watch bots on grid (bots warp off). 
---
So yes. It's not that there are no botters in Delve, but that Delve botters aren't being reported.
---
I thought Spike would be the one ok with a downside if it's a powerful card.
---
As if the chart came with surprising news. All entities has botters. If you’re running a renter program you’ll have a bunch regardless.
---
People on Western countries generally cannot fathom the lack of freedom Chinese people have. 
---
There is no maybe about being watched.

Everything is racist these days. Disagree with a woman: racist. Wear a red hat: racist. Have a penis: racist and misogenist. Any of the above and white: Fuck you racist xenophobic fuck! Go die.
---
From personal experience I can't help you as I've failed numerous times at enjoying this game. But I am considering re-joining Eve now but running a few characters (Alts) instead of just one, just to keep content fresh should one of them stagnate. Nullsec can be an absolute drag initially until you build a repertoire with your large corp. Maybe don't invest too heavily in your character from an immersion perspective, it is just a clone. But just know that Eve is a sandbox game which by definition means no endgame, no goal even - except what you make of it.
---
I blew 20b a few weeks ago on the market. Jita was laggy and I was updating a load of buy orders. It didn't register a decimal point so I suddenly bought 200mil of gas for 20bil. 
---
Shit happens.
---
What started as a small skirmish war between BOT (Order66) and Friends (Skeleton Crew/Damned Brotherhood and now X-Com) Vs Cockroach Coalition (Unspoken/JAG/Lazerhawks) has escalated with NC/Panfam helping BOT and Goons helping Cockroach guys. 
---
Last night was a massive step up in hostilities. I may be wrong but for so many different alliances to show up with large fleets to fight over the I-Hub of a small 200 man alliance (even Fraternity brought a fleet!) it felt like the start of a much bigger conflict, a bit like the Franz Ferdinand shooting started the ball rolling for WWI IRL.

We should totally forget about how CCP let someone stay in this game who went on stage in front of thousands and encouraged them to try and get someone to kill themselves.
---
Dinner Co was a thing briefly several years back after the HBC
---
What Corps?
---
Yeah, maybe 30 years ago...
---
How things should be when you encounter bots in your own ranks
---
I didnt see ranger regiment, what s their name?
---
they aren't "allowing" botting. i don't think anyone does. they just don't care about policing it
---
they might be but it's not really that powerful, basically every removal spell kills it, you need to untap with it for it to do anything and the effect isn't that powerful. Now if it was [Hymn to tourach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=hymn+to+tourach) on the other hand..........

---
And at the same time, why not ask for a star gate into Stain?
---
Rawr sort dragon kill fren.
---
well if you look at a lot of those alliances, they have disbanded long time ago. the fact that some of them even made top5 shows that they had quite a few bans.
---
I work with Chinese folks, at least one of them seems to buy it. But she lives in Canada... ???
---
You're missing a crucial point for gigx, he didn't just say something while mad. He also wanted that players irl location.
---
I’m not saying that would be an amazingly unlikely event. The odds would literally be astronomical.
---
But: if you had yourself a decent-sized shooting war and you spent some ammunition and you didn’t care where it all went, that could lead to lots of ammo free-flying through space, with nothing to stop it.
---
I’m not claiming we should hold our breath waiting for it to happen, but what if, right?
---
I have been running PI in Perimeter for years making 800m isk a month or so just cause it's easy and I barely spend at time on it. Can sell everything in system without transporting it. 
---
However, since Pandemic Horde had lost the Perimeter trade wars, the POCO tax has gone from 7% to 20%+. Kinda pissed at TEST for doing a shit job on killing 3rd party POCOs and keeping the rates high. Never had a problem in 2yrs with PH running the show.
---
or just whack-a-mole
---
Where a bot?
---
Oh God do.you want to insta teleport.  Find a fucking wormhole like everyone else. Even If you had a NPC const next to Oasa you'd still be far away from other drone lands.  Do you want npc  const  there too? Jeez
---
Clearly we've known for years dronelands are crap and that it's just purely for renting. Which I disagree with renting on this scale anyway but that's another story.
---
You have to ask why no actual alliances want it and then CCP needs to change it so they do.
---
And actually I do believe we need more NPC 0.0 space and more gates from low sec to those regions s such as Venal and stain etc
---
But CCP sort of did that with wormholes as a way to get to places. Find one. Drop a citadel with a clone bay and way you go.
---
God next you'll be wanting a low sec gate to stain!
---
but that alliance isnt on the pie chart these cant be bots checkmate idiot peligro confirmed it
---
I was called a racist on french forum too at the begining of this week for exactly the same stuff. My post was deleted. The more funny is that the guy that called me a racist and deleted my post has an alliance that his blue to FRT.
---
Not surprising per se but with the level of propaganda against Goons I think everyone who's clicked it so far fully expected Goons to be way up there, especially since this is \_lifetime permabans\_ per alliance.  
---
Now we have it right out of the CCP Security team's mouth - renting groups are botter havens and NC/PL renter groups account for a staggering 16% of all permabans. They accuse others of ruining the game by harboring bots but are infact the biggest surviving bot haven of them all.
---
it's the same thing Sort said, he doesn't want people running around reporting bots because of all the drama it generates. And the Slyce case is a perfect example. If they just reported bots, no one would give a fuck, but since they decided to setup that toon, that immediately causes drama within coalition. And I'm with Sort here, it's not something you want in your coalition. If the alliance leader is stupid enough not to understand the importance of keeping coalition free from internal drama, they can get the fuck out.
---
Maybe at their peak that was true but that hasn't been true for a long ass time. As of today they're a third rate alliance and I'm not surprised Sort decided to kick them albeit with a fake excuse (racism lmao!). As someone already said, the majority of their actually good players and active pvpers left months ago after the war with Goons ended. They only stuck around for so long because of a sense of loyalty and didn't want to be seen abandoning their allies. The only reasonably good corp left is probably SBBAL, the rest are renter tiers and some are actual renters that merged into the alliance. If you look at their (formerly) premier pvp corp, ARTOS, you'll see that half the barely active top PvPers are Rick's alts. That says a lot about the state of the alliance when their historically best corp is barely a blip on the pvp radar.
---
Well, English is kinda important for every MMO with a big western playerbase. ALL fleets i have been part of required at least you being able to recieve commands in english. It's just how it is. 
---
Take it from the point of someone giving advice. Someone asks you for advice (in english), ehich you give to the best of your knowledge, also in english and then the person starts speaking some weird language you do not understand and/or asking you to rephrase because they dis not understand it well. 
---
At that point, 90% of people loses ANY interest in helping they might have had before. Happened to me many times in many games. 
---
Speaking, or at least understanding is a main prerequesite to be successful in a game that relies on socialization as EvE does. 
---
It does not mean i dislike your project at all, i wish you luck. 
---
The point is, people that speak different/minor languages should not feel entitled to getting information in that language. I know that, because literally NOBODY speaks my native language.
---
 CCP cannot be trusted to do their own damn jobs though
---
You have security calling out individual alliances, it doesn't take that long to compile numbers you already figured out how to quantify. 
---
At this point I wouldn't be surprised if BPOs were being handed out again.
---
I doubt that any of the chinese EVE gamers took part in this massacre, and I would assume that a lot of them would have been amongst the protesters (students). So this is right in the same way to shame them with this as to post swastikas and nazi slur to local everytime you see a player you assume to be german ...
---
We will see that happen.
---
TBH, If you look at the time the alliances have been holding space by the percentages on that chart the period basis renters are really knocking it out of the park. 
---
And before you ask, I am not in panfam: I am in the group that just got told not to hunt the bots in period basis because apparently loggoff traps for bots = cloaky camping.
---
I actually checked if there is such an item lol
---
I guarantee your shitty 3D printer can’t print something better than this
---
so you think anonymously harassing other people is ok, but as soon as someone exposes the harasser, he's entitled to run away and cry to daddy?

---
Yes. CCP trolling StainGuy again.
---
Out of curiosity, what is your native language?
---
Yup just report the bots let CCP sort them out. An there no drama with leader ship, where there having to course drama looking into it.
---
You seem to be Sort-ing out a lot of memes dedicated to the Bot Warden of the north today lol.
---
What was the 'treason'? Not following up all the political nullsec shit these days...
---
Czech. 10M speakers worldwide. :D
---
Why would they want to go into a dead alliance?
---
Which is being at the minimal an antagonist, racist when you think they deserve it for living in a country that makes it incredibly difficult to leave. 
---
Literally no different than if the USA disconnected people who seen memes making fun of the orange man. 
---
Fuck botters but randomly disconnecting someone who's just trying to play a game is a piece of shit thing to do.
---
That's fair, lol!
---
Why? People should go now against bot harboring alliances and their renters groups so people like :              
---
* FRT           
---
* XXdeath        
---
* NC.

* Skill?                
---
Data show purely who is ruining the game for rest of New Eden.            
---
Purge those RMTers and botters and then have fun in much more healthy game.
---
yes
---
Clearly didn't krab enough
---
GFs all around that was a good night. FAX's are totally balanced :P
---
&gt;So yes. It's not that there are no botters in Delve, but that Delve botters aren't being reported.
---
I think it's way more likely that you're just completely wrong.
---
They don't see it though, they're disconnected prior to actually receiving that data so no awareness is raised unless they aren't disconnected which if they're unaware of the event they're going to have no reason to search a random(to them) location. 
---
Simply saying something doesn't raise awareness. You need to create dialogue.
---
It's a great place to be!
---
Love the ult

Not even hate the guy or his krabbing coalition. He is just inspirational meme content in the desert that nullsec is these days. :)

---
After talking to several persons involved in the spy business, I have to say that this banwave seems to be quite low-effort. 
---
CCP did not ban Characters specifically for botting, they took data from proven botting chars as it seems an just applied them to all members of this corp being quite young and low on SP.
---
In fact they banned a lot of spy chars created to hunt the bots too, Chars that can only fly a frig with Cyno and did never rat nor undock in the last weeks.
---
I am a little bit disappointed, also about the fact that it takes about 10 minutes to find a botted VNI or Super in Delve, but Mittens now smugposting.
---
Sounds like he wants to move back to delve.
---
*It is to assume all botters are chinese though. 
---
Also, this is memeing human rights issues, let's not gaslight it as a social justice conversation.
---
No, that one never happened. /s
---
His stats should be X/X, where X = number of botters in his alliance
---
Slyce died for this
---
Maybe trig npc sov in sansha and drone space as they invade.
---
Ccplz
---
Lol, you don't get kicked from the Imperium for feeding
---
This guy needs to go.
---
Brought a smile to my face.  That was too cool.
---
Idunno, facwar has a lot of bots too
---
i give it a few months before gotg or dead co what ever they call them self's now is dead. being a goon pet was never a deal those guys signed up. RR already lost a big corp to Frat cause of Sorts increasing ties with goons.
---
Imagine if you were one of those Basis though. They got rough-touched right into their pods.
---
faxes usually (or likely always) mean 'Force Auxiliary' ships, basically capital logis
---
Seems good. Don't forget to go crap on test renters as the Reddit narrative says they have the most bots.
---
(no seriously, I don't care, they're fucking renters, just give us a fight)
---
It’s literally the same as any other alliance into PL.
---
lm already Ginger and soulless add Orthodox {insert religion here} would be to much
---
Yeah, XIX is not a coalition member, they're blue due to common enemy. I hope we're back to shooting at each other once the frat botting menace is exterminated.
---
In case of sansha space only Paragon Soul could actually use a gate to Stain, if you check what region sansha holds they are pretty well connected to NPC areas  ^(but Stain lacks the gate to lowsec)
---
I’d say I’d trade Sort for a pile of kangaroo dung but honestly after Sort doxxed Rick I’m not sure I could tell the difference between the two.
---
Its actually from a Greek Myth. Specifically about a Enemy of Greece who was supposed to have fallen from the stars and brought havoc to earth.
---
To save themselves the Greek's made an alliance with an outcast Roman Worker called Optimus Primus, who lead a small group of Ex-Roman Slaves who had banded together under his banner and saved Greece from Megathron and his evil warriors.
---
git em rats
---
Dat cap stability tho
---
True, but there is huge difference between FW and Nullsec.      
---
People in FW use ventures and frigates ... while renter bots starts on VNI ... but often those are battleships, capitals or supers.
---
Actually it's pronounced s.
---
The Uranu is silent.
---
Not hard to understand.
---
People bot MORE elsewhere. It doesnt mean goon have no bot.
---
If you have doubt on people boting. Make a video and give it to ccp. Real player are always happy to see bot banned. It can be red / blue, we for the majority dont give a fuck.
---
Many dudes hate goons; if they can make some goon banned, they will (look gara case). When you see the number of ppl roaming for pvp in delve, and you know that, you know that they are a lot of ppl that can find and report this bot.
---
Also it s so stupid to bot in delve. You will dropp them. Pl will dropp them. Nc will dropp them. Snuff will dropp them. Gang bang will dropp them.
---
&gt;Japanese portray themselves as victims
---
&gt;US drops 2 Bombs on civilians but it's okay because there aren't any rules/agreements against the use of Atomic weapons yet even tho it was obvious to everybody that they are far worse than chemical weapons.
---
Not fully unjustified
---
I know but when you compare the Test recently acquired KWG and 16% from NC. or stuff that FRT is doing now ... like why you will go for small fish first?
---
Btw whats the point of this stupid thing? Shaming Chinese people, and makes u feel better than them? Like YOUR GOV never did horrible thing? To me all the gov around world r equally shit. Dont judge that is my personal opinion.
---
So is it racist? No, it just point out censorship. Does it hurt Chinese player's feeling? I think yes.
---
I would but I dont want to
---
Thanks Gevlon\_Delve
---
&gt;  If you are a Dead Coalition member at this point and still like the game, please look elsewhere.  
---
This sentence is retarded in several ways, which is an accomplishment in itself.
---
OT, I think Sort just chose a dumb lame excuse to do what he always does with less active alliances, which is to kick them out.
---
I'm not voting for him, but from reading CSM minutes I always get the impression he's a member with constructive input. So I don't think his issue with Slyce should relate to the CSM in any way.
---
To be totally fair, B0T has changed hands multiple times, being controlled by xXDEATHXx for a few years.
---
Best of luck with that, looks like you'll need it.
---
Sort got stuffed out
---
pray?

Just a reminder this BR tool is completely unusable on mobile
---
I don't disagree with you.. and with all the different accents of our diverse FCs, it's vital to know English well.. but I guess some help is better than no help..
---
At the very least, I hope some of us can get together in Bangalore for a beer like people in the Seattle and Charlotte etc do :D
---
Let's drink giant's milk to memes indeed!
---
Yeah, the newer renter groups definitely seem to bot more.
---
They also run missions in jackdaws
---
Its nice to see our corner of space completley uneffected, dispite the huge concentration of small alliances in the area
---
I gotta admit stainguy you had me in the first half.
---
Who the fuck plays eve and downvotes that
---
Fuck bots gas the bots
---
Can we also get "multifit from container" and "create contract from container"
---
So fast aligning ships that is hard to catch.
---
BRB writing gay fanfiction about Sappo and PGL in my ship names
---
Yeah, you basically have to smartbomb them
---
I think I get it now. You think the world revolves around you. Inflating your importance in the "fight against botters". You "hunt" in Delve and see bots there so You come to the conclusion Goons are bad and supports bots. You state somewhere else in this thread that you found 8+ bots in delve in one month, trying to make that sound like a lot. 8 is not a lot.
---
You claim that there's few people "hunting" in Delve and a lot of them in the remote regions of the drone regions? How do you know that? Do you have access to the intel channels in Delve? I can assure you, there are a lot of activity in them (afk campers excluded).
---
Maybe the reason you think the data is showing that there are "no botters in Delve" is because you can't fathom how insignificant you are?
---
Just because goons aren't on the chart doesn't mean they don't have bots, it just means they aren't in the "top 25".
---
An FW rep? You'll have my vote
---
I actually did not know that.
---
Thats fcked up...
---
just fit the azeotropic version if your fitting allows - rare that that the f-s9 extra ehp will actually save your skin in a frig fight - and its only about 1 mil

Better solution is to never not be poor.

It not like it can do much else ever. Other then run its link and maybe kill someone dumb frigs. TS drones could do max vni damage.
---
this would be great, i hope this thread gets movement
---
Well, there is only one way to not make mistakes - do nothing)
---
Fairly sure there's a lot of downvote bots on this subreddit; just check new threads and almost all of them are downvoted to zero instantly.
---
I'm so sorry
---
Cool but when we will get those vids from presentations in St. Petersburg?
---
Horde takes you without API.
---
I might be able to take this comment seriously if you didn't identify as Pandemic Legion.  Just sayin.
---
Shoot, forgot about that. You're right
---
oh boy.
---
Maybe because people too scared to report them because of their alliance gestapo ? Just an dea ... nvm
---
Because internet, that's why.
---
Do you have clear vision?
---
Get your bearings straight. They went to The Therapist. Not to Frat.
---
and then he doxxed riot rick for that, so triple asshat move
---
can't get scammed if you never login ;)

To make a long story short: Everyone
---
Every time players do this, CCP has failed.
---
It was a crime against humankind, but so were the acts of Japan commited under the name of Imperialism, like Nanjing, to name an example.
---
Japan has been known to edit out the 'uncomfortable' bits of it's history in textbooks and such.
---
That's honestly very likely, what else would botters use to defend themselves? Downvote bots and fake news bots.

Tinfoil: CCP is gonna let this slide under the rug because Briscgate just happened and it's a bad look for CCP and the CSM if another dramafest happens again so soon.
---
Are you excluding the importance that fullerenes have in eve universe ? Depending on how much of an HOPG you are i can turn you into one.
---
I agree. But if they wanted to make a argument what I spun it as makes much more sense then claiming racism.
---
First of all, I seriously can’t believe you are still typing. Second, this thing is solid resin, there is zero way your weak ass could break this.
---
He did, just not intentionally. He posted my name from a 2016 log on Discord to a few thousand people.
---
That's totally why people are 'talking about it'. Let's be real here, the people 'talking' about it are meme edgelords who are the same guys copy and pasting the shit into local because it might negatively impact Chinese players, you do not see TEST line members campaigning on these issues, donating money or time in real life, because ultimately *they don't care about what happens to china outside of EVE*, they are in it for the memes, they are not saints that need to be defended but they are also not racist, white knighting people spamming stuff that they are spamming to ***literally try to get chinese players banned/ removed from the game*** is stupid, fuck those people.

Jumpgate to Empire region "The Forge" with Tradehub Jita, covering a huge distance too far to travel with jumpdrives. Controlling this entrance makes Logistics much easier ...
---
pretty much basic trading 101 :) always just have your max amount inside your personal wallet and don't let any toons of yours buy based on your corp wallets, then you're perfectly safe and might only lose whatever you got in your personal wallets.
---
The document was an internal one for us to report. A log from 2016 with my real name was pinged on Discord to thousands of people and had no relation to the internal reporting spreadsheet.
---
was playing pretty seriously a few years ago, am considering coming back to destroy botting scum
---
i know i know, i just didn't want to post absolute values, or anything you could infer absolute values from
---
\&gt;  how all alliances have bots and singling out the Chinese alliances for it is racist. 
---
Well, he's not wrong. There is a very clear undertone of vilification of Chinese players. It's almost like people can't think for themselves...
---
sorry im bad at typing things, ironic isnt it when such a high profile character gets paid to join an alliance then announces hes gonna run for CSM only for CCP to announce the people who paid him are one of the worst botters currently in game
---
Honestly this isn't the only thing that has aged well in the past year of this grand opera we call eve.
---
They also perma-banned someone who threatened to cut someone's hands off in a moment of madness.  What's your point?
---
Oh fuck I just realized that
---
Thanks
---
Heron :) cheap and can still defend itself
---
I will gladly take Sorts place on the CSM and I am confident I can do a better job at setting an example of how to properly behave.
---
LOL really. I mean, considering that I helped saved the coalition during PH/BL wars and convinced Ranger Regiment and Siberian Squad to stay strong as they were about to flip to Gobbins and Elo, I think I did a fair bit of heavy lifting. I even donated 40bn? worth of ore to help with their SRP as they were flushed out and Sort was able to get them ships.
---
BoT was a joint venture of PL and XiX, and the first renting manager was Farasoloni from PL. Somewhere in Autumn 2014 (about 1.5 years after creation) it was sold to NC. Since then it is continously NCdots Renter Alliance, while NA mostly harbors NCdot-Krab-Alts
---
BoT was sold in Autumn 2014 to NCdot, so no change since then ...
---
I don't remember mittens doxxing you
---
"your max amount" of what?  Every time you buy an item, shift ISK out of your wallet to match the price of that item?  Do people do that?
---
Sorry disjointed threads here, this is related to op topic not Mittens.

Not really sure what happened. I don't understand contract scams. Never bought stuff off Jita contracts spammed in local

Same, but it is time for some things like this to actually become a reality.
---
The entire eve community is damaged by all involved from the idiocy of riot trying to pull politics in and use it as a cudgel to sort for doxxing to asher for making this post.
---
Clearly didn't bot enough
---
Ahh. I was calling the retard doing the "but mittens at FANFEST in the wizards hat" whining. 
---
Reddit been kinda fucky lately.
---
Thanks, I will be looking into that.
---
I'm negative with Caldari, positive with Kaalakiota.
---
I'm going to look into this. Thanks!
---
I don’t feel calling my orientation into question is appropriate. 
---
I would like to focus on the bigger issues such as enhancing the status and increasing the proliferation of Carbon within New Eden.
---
Yes sir, let’s fill the crocks with beans lol. Btw best time would be autz/eutz during ustz it can get blobby since the standing fleet gets hungry at that point
---
&gt;You just get trapped in null, roadblocked in all directions, with no assets or skills to join activities with others, no market to interact with, no idea who's who or what's going on, no sense of autonomy and a long boring wait for anything to actually happen while you sit ship spinning in a secluded station and reading corp mails and chat jargon that makes no sense. And unless your social skills are good enough to make friends with foreigners quick then this is the endgame :)
---
1. *Knowing what to do* - When you first join a group, you're usually provided a step by step guide to get where you need to be and where to find learning materials. Personally, Horde offers newbean wings in every op, newbean ratting or mining fleets, and a 24/7 standing fleet that's always filled with small gang content. Outside of that - they offer training classes, training plans, and logical progression through different types of gated corporations.  
---
2. *Applying that knowledge* - With that said, none of this is going to be spoonfed to any player. You have to actively participate, read, and learn. EVE has one of the hardest learning curves of any game and while a good corporation is going to make that easier, it's going to be nowhere close to traditional games. When those events are not happening, there is plenty of content a day 1 character can partake in NullSec. (Mining in a venture--Belt Ratting--Salvaging--Station Trading in the main corp hub--Exploration--Small gang PvP--SOE Epic Arc)
---
3. *Jump starting asset growth* - All newbie friendly corporations that I'm aware of provide new players with a better starting package than the game. This includes skill books to train into doctrines. Outside of that, you are on your own with purchasing skills - which by the way are now purchasable directly through the skill screen rather than hunting them down in station. (QoL changes, yay!) Speaking of which, there exists a full market hub in every 0.0 corporation. Test, Horde, and Goons have massive active markets in their space.  
---
4. *Social skills* - Eve is able to be played alone but to get the full benefit of the game you'll need the cooperation of your fellow pilots.  
---
If you find yourself struggling to get integrated into EVE it's possible the game just isn't for you. And that's okay. It isn't a one size fits all game and neither is NullSec. I always recommend Null starter corps as a great intro to the game. From there, you will have attained the skills to go anywhere, WH, LoSec, HiSec, wherever.
---
WINNIE TEH POOH APPROVES
---
I guess you would do it a few bil at a time
---
no goons  
---
fake
---
Wait, so they really want Stain? where is Stainguy saying more gates to get to areas to detour botters?
---
Isn't that the new system connecting Stain to Lowsec?
---
if you run for csm joe i will vote 4 u with all of my hundreds of bot accounts

Black Nova Corp was his first actual victim, followed closely by IT Alliance. May they rest in peace.

The level of spodbrain required for this 300IQ strat is impossible to simulate.

---
The Vagabond is a Thukker Tribe design, so it may just be paying homage to their historically nomadic lifestyle. Same goes for the Probe.
---
What does remedial mean?
---
While it’s true I do go in hard on issues relating to Carbon, I believe in taking the Tenacious D approach to working with others, in the words of our lord and saviour Jack Black (pbuh):
---
“You don’t always have to fuck her hard”
---
With this in mind I am willing to be flexible on issues not relating to Carbon such as botting, Citadel proliferation and the requirement for some TLC for FW.
---
Idk why but I kind of enjoy "recycling" modules that I looted.  just a weird fetish of mine
---
That makes a ton of sense. thanks!
---
No i need the pg fitting from the compact medium
---
Did happen once before though, right?
---
Mr Carbon, i shall remember you that Crystalline Carbonides are a thing, im starting to feel a bit of a prejudice towards your fellow allotropes http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/market.php?group_id=1860 they also deserve recognizition, they prefer to hybridizate at sp2 and thats not a problem.
---
found the dronelands renter
---
I like using Briskgate since it just happened and this is a CSM too :P
---
Also, I want to renamed so it uses the Tea's spelling, yep. Gotta added a twist of lemon ;D
---
Someone with a pretty shady RL history like Sort shouldn't go around doxxing and then publicizing the doxxing. smh
---
&gt; Riot Rick
---
Ok, for the retards like me.  Can someone explain why Sort is doxxing Riot Rick?
---
Making a law then going back and punishing everyone who did the thing PRIOR to the new law is a bad policy to have.
---
Wanna know something funny? If I wanted to I could easily ask for a 5 year visa and get one on the sole virtue of having a grandparent who fucked off from China ages ago. From that point on, getting a Chinese passport isn't that difficult.
---
It isn't difficult for me to get one. But I don't want to.
---
How do you shift isk out of your wallet, do you just transfer it out to your alt or something? Because I’ve been thinking to do the same thing
---
It’s an English word meaning wanderer.
---
Yes, Jita spam is 99% scam.
---
What happened: I needed Bhaal blueprint, searched contracts, sorted by price. Lowest was 81, next 99. I opened contract, checked that it's isk for blueprint I need and pushed "Accept". Get error message that you can see on screen.
---
What really happened: Sorting was from High to Low, and it was 81b, not 81m like I thought. I did not pay attention and accepted scam contract. Only thing that saved me is that I did not have 81b.
---
Best was being in NC for last election, and giving pushback on why I wouldn't vote for Sort even though he was a ~coalition ally~. Ladyscarlet argued with me for a good while about how I needed to put aside my feelings and do it for the better good.
---
I said fuck that noise.
---
Good, botting on VMs is a pain in the ass.
---
Who did the initial stalk/tackle?
---
Do y'all have a discord for this stuff?
---
I have never and will never discriminate based on the physical form of an element.

I take offence to the insinuation of any malfeasance in relation to my fellow allotropes.

&gt;y'all
---
problematic aave appropriation...
---
Yeah personally as a recruiter in SLYCE I do full ESI checks as well as a interview over comms. Some darkness corps just accept anyone. I definitely have probably seen your low level spy's around. And purging memberships is a big deal too. Keeps the spy's fresh at least 😂
---
Both my parents put F in local when l was born.
---
Also its a sacrilegious use of the Hel, a fine spacefaring vessel when manned properly by a neckbeard in his basement and not a computer program.
---
Well, it is really first time I got successfully scammed during like 2y in EVE.
---
Usually I was like "lol, it's obvious scam, who would fall for it?".
---
Ngl, adding that kind of shit would make me more likely to bot.
---
I'd want a Just to deal with that shit.
---
were not the 2 beams ships am not coming they have upped the dmg so the 1 beam at max stacks will do x2 dmg
---
T1 dessies for the most part, but I have recently started flying a sentinel.
---
At least two, I’d say 3 systems per region and maybe 4 stations in those systems.  (Great Wildlands being the model here)
---
So that's two different situations. Sort literally doxxed someone while Mittens just told people not to do X. What's your point?
---
Considering that this chart shows data from the very start of EVE online, yea I would expect that.  Also wtf is going on with Fraternity where they get to 5% in less than half the amount of time the others took?
---
Sadly, it’s the standing dog the corporation that applies first IIRC :/
---
Cyclone - tanky AF, 
---
Cynabal - fast AF to catch that guy I just saw on dscan with my indy alt,

Cloaky prot - catches ppl that don't wanna fight, 
---
Rupture - cheap af and gets good fights, 
---
Shield cane - memories of the good times and great dps,
---
hobo
---
Clearly a very fast hobo
---
&gt; I think I get it now. You think the world revolves around you
---
Nah. There are many bots in Delve. We kill them occasionally. They don't get permabanned. And you are just another victim of the koolaid Mittens and co is serving you.
---
&gt; 8 is not a lot.
---
8 in a month of afk cloaking campaign is a lot. Hints at the amount that doesn't die. There hundreds of VNI killmails. How many killmails does it take for you to believe an alliance harbors bots? I've seen Goons doing it with 1 killmail when it was a rival alliance. People flamed KWG for years for 8-10 supers.
---
L MAO
---
&gt; People bot MORE elsewhere. It doesnt mean goon have no bot.
---
If you mean real person / bot ratio that doesn't matter.
---
If you mean there are numerically less botters in Delve, I don't think so. FRT Treasury has about 1000 chars. I think it's entirely possible for the entire Imperium space to have about 500 botter chars.
---
and left it with a 50% reactivation bonus to defender launchers...
---
Thanks for detailed reply :) I'm still thinking of giving it another shot but the social skills aspect is probably going to be my downfall for all the other points. Even when I have joined voice comms I'm usually that guy who just lurks without a word to say to anyone. My presence just feels like constant awkwardness lol.
---
In the 4-5 years of on/off Eve Online gameplay, I've been killed maybe 30 - 50 times or more (too many to remember) and not a single kill. I am officially the worst Eve player you will ever encounter. I wonder if this borders on masochism? lol. I've roamed with gangs before but die before I even knew what was going on. Then when it comes to asking for a ship I usually have the wrong BP's or skills too and can't be helped until after "month" of training, so meh...
---
I second that. short and entertaining. good stuff
---
If you set your ingame graphics to toaster mode, it replaces all of those annoying video panels to a static image that simply says "The Scope".  Do so by going to the graphics tab of the options screen and reducing shader level from high to low.
---
Of course you lose all shadows, and your screen display now looks like something from 1995, but hey - small price to pay to not see adverts.
---
Other benefits of toaster mode include massively reduced system load for when you are multiboxing, reducing the absolutely insane solar glare to a much more manageable and less eye-raping state, and removing those god damned volumetric anti-gpu clouds that CCP like to put literally everywhere.
---
While i appreciate good graphics as much as the next guy, i spent a lot of (but not all) my play time in toaster mode because i multibox frequently and have an older computer.  The benefits really grow on you.  The shitty unshaded graphics you get used to and dont really notice unless your next to a gate or in a station.
---
i had no clue this GF post would turn into a salt mine.
---
I thought the Therapist was with Frat?
---
bots = subs for CCP. The facade of 'doing something' is just that.. a facade. They really don't GAF.
---
Thank fuck. The ikitursa cap was so bad that it needed a booster just to keep a prop mod, the gun, and tackle running (single scram even)
---
This is a pathetic post. Sort should not get banned from the CSM for this. The Goon pet circle jerk here is strong.
---
I have been using a fit with Data &amp; Relic Analyzer 2's. I see no problem dropping the Data Analyzer.
---
I must insist on a Relic Analyser 2!!!
---
It's been said that instead of the game design and lore team reworking the thousands of missions in the database, they are instead focusing on this new type of pve and the triglavians will be near the center of it. I'm hoping that you are wrong and that this is the revamped pve we've been waiting for but history shows otherwise. 
---
Current mood: cautiously optimistic
---
I'm happy we don't know what's coming. The worst thing that could happen is it be figured out before it hits the live server and is farmable even before it's released.
---
No. This is a retarded comment. Gigx was attempting to find The Judge's real life location and information WHILE stating threats towards him. If you think that is "a LOT less", than you're an idiot...
---
Flair checks out...
---
Renter/botter drama
---
Split it. 10% bonus to max damage cap and 10% bonus to damage increase per cycle. This would allow the t2 ships to do more damage than the t1 counterpart, but t would also spool up faater. It would reduce the overall max damage to somewhere around 1300 with the turret but it would also get there in a reasonable time.
---
BUT ISRAEL WAS HITLER'D AND UR DENYING THE HOLOCAUST.
---
Lol OK never would I ever live in drones..
---
To be fair, this information is about Banned Users, not specifically Users Banned for Botting.  The numbers will include those people given permanent bans for botting, but will not be limited to such.
---
Off hand, I have no idea what proportion of permanent bans issued by CCP are for botting versus the total number.  It may be perfectly reasonable to assume that most permanent bans are for such.
---
I have said for years that dronelands need npc space. Now would be a perfect time to make it triglavian npc space.
---
Lol do you feel better now? I sometimes feel better sometimes after a emotional release.
---
There is
---
In todays world racism just means "Saying anything bad about someone who isn't white."
---
Well lets say you have an own corp for yourself, give all people that you know might transfer money between personal wallets and corp wallets access to it. So you limit accidents already by not giving all your alts access where you don't need it.
---
And then you can go into corp wallet and have the methods to take and give ISK ... to and from your personal wallet. Big amounts in corp wallet, small amounts in personal, just how much you usually need or want. The less the less risk, but the more you might need to transfer. Find the best way for yourself in terms of how much. :)

AIDS
---
That ban was nothing, not to mention he said the ban didn't matter and took steps to make sure that it would have no effect anyway as well as showing no remorse (was mad about the ban). He did get punished but it was a VERY light punishment :|
---
Little bit!
---
If you're buying a big ticket item, or you have access to a TON of liquid isk, this isn't unreasonable.
---
If you're worth a few tril, I think you'd just shift in 10B at a time.
---
Except "gassed jew" is a reference towards a genocide committed against an ethnic group by another group.
---
This is a shitty take since the chinese were mowed down by their own government not because they were chinese but because of their political ideology.
---
Grrrr goons...
---
&gt;but this weapon type is still kinda meh for PVE
---
There's an easy fix for that
---
&gt; As an aside, there are certain IHUB upgrades that are required to build Titans/Supers so maybe those could be shut down as well and the builds could be put on pause until the re-enforcement timer is won by the defenders? Leading to fights being fought over the ability to produce Titans/Supers. This is just a side idea but thought it was an interesting one to include. 
---
No capital builder with a shred of intelligence builds supercaps near an area with ongoing sov warfare
---
Message me for access to sphere version 4.0.0.5 and you can kill BOTs like us :). Initial isk deposit required
---
I feel like I am on the edge of the dead sea and the wind has picked up and the salt spray is hitting me like a dragon breathing fire...
---
What I learned is that Sort vehemently agrees with and supports the Chinese government massacring and disappearing its citizens for wrongthink.
---
If we were numerically the same the data over the lifespan of FRT Treasury bans and Imperium bans would reflect that and we would be in the top 25. Keep spinning that narrative.
---
Farming them is not gonna work due to loot drops not being reliable. You could hunt cruiser rats for 1 hour and get none.
---
Whereas if you lazy anomaly rat for 1 hour you could make 60 mil and buy yourself 10 units.
---
So it’s OFFICIAL GOTG Goon PET?
---
He got kicked from his position as chairman of the CSM and given a temp ban. I'm not sure what else would be justifiable there given the circumstances.
---
Sort should be given the same.
---
I am guessing that your observations and Pelligros data and tools to review these accounts that you all report disagree.
---
Maybe it is because nobody reports them, fearing punishment as it is forbidden in Imperium ?
---
Oh, if you can run T2, do it.  This was meant for people who couldn't.
---
Yes, you're new aren't you?
---
So you report them. 2 things are happening either ccp ignores the tickets or thinks you are wrong when they look at the data that you dont have access to.
---
If anything, this would just lead to more blob mechanics or tidi fests which few people enjoy
---
Classic case of 2 shitty cards making a pretty cool combo.
---
You do realize most bots are just alts of major coalitions (GSF, PL, XXX, test, etc...).
---
How tho? Its doing the opposite by encouraging attackers to spread out and entosis multiple systems across a constellation to reduce the likelyhood of a large blob being dropped on them and instead having a small crew coming in to kill them
---
What sort did is nowhere as bad :| Kicked from the CSM sure not really sure what's ban worthy.
---
And a much longer ban would have been justifiable, up to permanent. Similar to good old mr hands.

Sort: Here is a blank check with my name on it, I will pay any amount of money to get you to fuck off.  
---
Yah, that was a good plan...
---
4 years old, so I wasn't around for those changes I guess
---
This is gonna be great
---
Legit question: Can CCP in good faith police what happens in a 3rd party app like discord? Is there a current precedent for them taking action against someone in eve, for something done outside of eve?
---
Sort literally doxxed someone's real life information to his entire coalition. How you think that's worse than calling for in game harrasment of someone is beyond me.
---
&gt; having to look my house in the eye and say "we do not have this kind of hole."
---
Literally the worst feeling
---
Indeed.  
---
He also has his name on the B-R monument iirc
---
Wait, what gate deactivation?
---
Why does Sort support Chinese government initiated slaughter of its citizens?

RR wasn't a third party, they were with us. It's weird to me that Frat (99) crew (7) are headlined yet they were massively outformed by folks not even mentioned lol
---
Why did folks focus fire on a fax that can't even remote rep? :O
---
Sort is a goon Pet plz
---
I've been relistening to old Shit on Kugu podcast episodes, the HBC/TEST fallout and Dinner Squadron were good times.
---
Would like Doxx Dragon  and sit in local and ask sort if he can offer me tips on how to lead an alliance.
---
doxxing has been against the rules for awhile, its not like this is something new
---
It has been proposed a bajillion times to CCP - make the fucking ads billable, with monthly subscription, thus another isk sink, that tye game needs, but no, skins are more important I guess.
---
Underrated comment.
---
Maybe not a garbage idea, but sov warfare doesn't need to have a place for small gangs.  Think about it.  A large alliance coordinates with several other large alliances to forcefully take a region of space, they clean out the previous holder's structures, they defend it for a time, sink billions of isk into infrastructure, and truly own the space... then any small gang can come in and force them to form for timers that they can't hope to actually attack.
---
At this point, what is the point of even having sovereignty?  If you want the space, come and take it or wait until we can't defend it.  Not everything has to be made so that casuals can participate.
---
Well slap me in my 5th testicle, I too watch Rudy.
---
Being a cute adorable newbee is a great time for profit.
---
Join your first fleet in your cute adorable frigate, get blown up hilariously and get showered in ISK, sometimes walking away with billions.
---
I haven't seen the information but it was just a name afaik? Not that huge. And yes it is nowhere near worse when the stated aim of the ingame harassment and griefing was to get someone to kill them self, someone who stated they have mental issues. How you think that isn't worse is god damn beyond me :|
---
Not only that he boasted about messing with him more himself, so not only did he (somewhat jokingly but you know there would be people that would do it) ask people to help get someone to kill themselves, but did it them damn selves. And you think saying someone's name, hell even if he gave their exact GPS coordinates it wouldn't be worse then that. Nothing short of a death threat would be.
---
Fly up into the C4C pocket in Fade. Ranger Regiment lives there in that pocket alone you will find 10+ Bots at any given time so no, 8 is realy not a lot.
---
&gt;racist when you think they deserve it
---
where'd you get that?
---
Awesome suggestions, meaning CCP will pass on them.
---
They are too good and too disturbing for reatrded 23/7 crabs.
---
He could simply hellcamp the SIG in ROIR or bring the caps to help PH to kill the keepstar in our borders, but I'm asking for too much from him
---
Are you also bad at reading things ? I say this because your train of thought seems to have nothing to do with my comment. Also Frat, who Elo joined, isn’t in the top 25 alliances for numbers of accounts banned. Perhaps you are replying to the wrong comment chain ?
---
I’ll start the bidding with 100 isk!
---
What fleet was it, that the bots would join it?
---
Hey now.  1DQ1-A system is now a bitchin' trophy room with all those stations he coughed up....
---
Large groups such as Goons have enough bigger toys to put on a large defense, any number of those could turn into slugfests resulting in unfun times. The same would be for other major powers. The current sov mechanics at their bones make any fight against another sov just not worth it.
---
I don’t think wingspan is allowed to have valid opinions about wormhole space
---
Yeah, someone recorded a gate on sisi turning red and turning off and on with triglavian signs on it
---
Tune in tomorrow to learn which direction the sun will rise fun?
---
Holy fuck mate. What kind of argument is that? We killed 8 in a month. That doesn't mean there is only 8. There is only so much we can kill.
---
How many Ranger Regiment killmails are there? You feel no hesitance to assume Ranger Regiment ships you see in that pocket are bots. Suddenly it becomes so hard to accept the possibility that some of the supers in Delve are also bots.
---
Well, I hate to burst your bubble. But it has nothing to do with you, and everything to do with the fact that that system is the gateway to highsec from drone lands and very important to panfam. Also, there were multiple timers being fought for. The fortizar in hull timer (saved from panfam) was another.
---
Thank you for the battlereport. Pandemic Legion lost the least amount of ships.
---
Blops staging anyone?

Oh he only doxxed a dudes RL name which could be used to find his facebook/linked in and other such profiles, that's fine then.  'A little bit of doxxing is fine' is the rule after all.

---
Are you dumb, is peligro coming over to my house and gonna ground me for botting. Yes players bot. get your head out of your ass.

&lt;users&gt; aren't allowed to &lt;commit infraction&gt;

Are you dumb, is &lt;org authority&gt; &lt;gonna do things to &lt;user&gt; unrelated to their authority&gt;. Yes &lt;users&gt; &lt;commit infraction&gt;. get yout head out of your ass.
---
Olmeca's comments are often such easy targets for criticism and yet you lot still manage to fail at that. It's impressive really.
---
Geese dude stop being racist.
---
You clearly don't see how blobs form these days. It is literally what you described.
---
Attacker (A) tries to reinforce iHub and hit infrastructure for weeks, the super blob of defender (B). All this in one system at a time, with multiple jump bridges and shitadels, with numerous timers to grind and form without even having fights most of the times.
---
Your not suppose to report to ccp.  However innominate is always available.
---
&gt;call out bots

&gt;omg its so racist

---
I can say the almost exact same thing about any other steriotype, after all they exist for a reason. Also arguing if something is racist or not is a waste of tme when racism itself isn't well defined anyway, but so is pretending to not understand how someone could have thought that was the case.
---
if you had to choose between a gate to stain and npc space in the drones what would it be?
---
I really like Sort, and I stand behind his decision...but honestly, this doesn't seem to have actually benefited DeadCo at all. All it seems to have done is hurt DeadCo more than help DeadCo. Slyce was the second largest Alliance in DeadCo and now that they're gone, there's a massive amount of space that's going to be contested. We'll see how this seriously affects DeadCo. I wouldn't be surprised if Deadco and Slyce go to war after this which is just no good.
---
That dude has always been a piece o' shit. How he ever made there to begin with, is beyond me.
---
It's not, I think he should be punished however it is nowhere near as bad as trying to get someone to kill themselves, boasting about it, and then also asking other people to mess with this person to also try and get him to kill himself. Someone who is mentally unstable and depressed at that.
---
I don't think there is a single well adjusted unbiased person who between the 2 options would say that having their real name released is worse, as bad, or anywhere close :|
---
worth it
---
Gate from stain to middle of the drone lands
---
Wasn't it a other way around? First he yelled at them for being edge lords and then kicked them for not toning it down?
---
Hi Riotrick alt account.
---
While there seems to be a lot of differing opinions on this subject, I’ve learned a shit ton.  Thanks to everyone for sharing the knowledge!
---
 You think. Yeah great, you can think what you want. Some ppl still think that the earth is flat. Or that the nuclear bomb is fake or some dumb stuff. It s their right. It s your right too to think that there is 500 botter in delve right now.
---
 But the fact is different. And CCP published the statistic. Now we can speak about fact and not thinking. Goon is a old alliance, the biggest one, and is not in the top25 botter. End of the story.
---
learn how to quote if you are gonna quote.  Quite impressive that you are able to turn your computer on.

Hi!
---
One down! 12 to go!

Just theory crafting.  How could they do that?  Would it require a rollback of citadel?  or something else?   
---
This graph shows some pretty disturbing shit but nothing that really surprises anyone with a brain.
---
What about an almost-Freeport with jump gate network?
---
To the point of ragebooting Slyce over it? Yeah no, that's not a thing. Shart may be a moron, but he's not that deficient.
---
Calm down miner.
---
not 100 percent but i believe they have in past with like mumble harrassment ect

please point to where you are seeing a single quote(or attempt at one) in my comment.

This is why you must trade with a toon with not so big wallet.

CCRAY corp  [https://evewho.com/corp/Crayven%20Corp./](https://evewho.com/corp/Crayven%20Corp./)  has goon director for those looking for black list
---
I like the names
---
That’s not really the point tho man. The point is that even thou the imperium may have the odd bot or two, they have much much less than a) other entities and b) than r/eve and other entities (including yourself) claim they have
---
You have to admit that using a character with that name specifically for "Chinese player's who feel they have been wrongly accused of botting" is culturally insensitive, at a minimum. I would be, roughly, something like "if you are an American player who feels like they have been wrongly accused, please contact the character 'School Shootings are Constitutionally Protected' or 'Genocided Native American'."
---
That said, public doxxing is not okay.
---
This is not a bad idea...could combine with trigalvian invasion!
---
Range bonus wasn't being applied initially.  That's now fixed.
---
Have you tried an MSE setup on your sentinel yet? It's a beast :D
---
CCP published stats on people getting permabanned. It didn't publish stats on botting. Botting and getting permabanned are different things, as if all botters got permabanned then we wouldn't have bots. This entire comment tree has been about establishing that point. I alreafy addressed your point. So don't be a parrot.
---
Wait!? But... grr goons?
---
And my point was that you can't infer these points from peligros data
---
If you think Mittens genuinely wanted thr guy to commit suicide you're actually retarded and not really worth the time trying to explain it to. 
---
At the point of time this incident occurred 'kill yourself' was an incredibly common meme/insult in eve, which obviously fell way out of favor when this incident kicked off bit.
---
Of course out of that context it looks really bad. Out of context a lot of things look worse than they actually are.
---
You can just convert it to some assets. (modules/resources/plex)
---
Or, you know, just pay attention when you get the "this is 5 gazillion percent above the average market price, are you sure you want to do this?" and then not hit 'OK.'
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
are you under the impression i'm defending his decision? did you even read the thread you're replying to?
---
Could be worse...
---
You could be renter
---
You misspelled krab.
---
Guilty. Ban them both, then don't respond to their petitions for redress or clarification. #CCP2019.
---
TLDR
---
:D
---
Thanks for your reply. I find this very interesting. I could completely agree with banning ANYONE in the game for saying "PersonX is actually John Doe" in Jita local or alliance chat, etc. But I guess my overall concern is how are 3rd party app "infractions" researched? Are logs presented to CCP by a player and some hope is made that the logs are not doctored? Does CCP request this info from the other company? I know you personally do not have all these answers but I feel like this is a very slippery slope. I could think of dozens of examples that some could call doxxing. Not sure where this policy ends. For example if I go a friends Facebook page and post a zkillboard of me killing them and say something like "ooh i got you frank"...did i just "doxx"? I'm just really on the fence about this situation. No one wants their info given out without their permissions, but at the same time what is the extent of a game company's TOS enforcement reach?
---
Why doesn't slyce take a stance towards darkness and actually fight for their piece of deklein?
---
I feel like that should be easily implementable as its own checkbox in settings called "Ad Blocker"
---
lol turkey is that you?
---
So let me give you a brief introduction on AOM and PIBC in serenity so you will know why you should fight against it.
---
PIBC was the largest alliance on the serenity server that cannot be defeated, undefeatable even all people outside PIBC united.
---
Why? it was the largest bot alliance and RMT workshop alliance, it started a pattern that using bots to generate isk and other resources to defeat all enemies.
---
keep this in mind, the isk price for a monthly subscription in serenity reached and stabilized at 30B. 
---
One of the reasons that most of the members in WC came to tranquility was because of this AOM (PIBC), no one can defeat them and no non-bot player can play happily anymore since the price of everything was ridiculously high. 
---
The most recent 600 accounts in the greater western whatever alliance are mostly the workshop test accounts of AOM(PIBC)
---
I am not kidding, check with those old Chinese members on tranquility immigrated from serenity, you will know what I said was true. 
---
Test alliance claimed they hate bots but they just took in the largest bots alliance ever. Fight them or wait for a 30B monthly subscription Lol
---
Downvoted for that edit
---
thanks, collecting atm
---
Graphs? *Graphs?*
---
Bro, this is eve. There is no place for graphs in a game like this...
---
Thank the Spod Gods lm not lol
---
If "new Chinese player alliances" will not botting and will not support botting, they are welcome to TQ.
---
We know what you can do against the rest of the world.
---
Bot and pay rent.
---
I am actually kind of a big person. I am 6 foot 5 and two hundred and twenty pounds. What I am not is a racist asshole, which, no offense to you, is a category that roughly 51% of Heathenry practitioners seem to fall in. 
---
I would also happily tell this to your face if we were drinking at a bar and you happened to mention it; however, I only mention it here for two reasons. 
---
First, there are no gods because, you know, I value human beings not being cowards and cowering before make believe deities and sky men and women. Second, and most importantly in this context (at least before you got all Heathen Jihadist) because you said something akin to "I am a neo-Norse Pagan, so Iceland sounds awesome," and I merely wanted to remind you that Iceland is mostly secular and non-religious, and its religious breakdown is something like 7% atheist and 85% Christian.
---
Edit

And also, I just generally like referencing how l337 wormholers are.

I don't know what exactly stands against this idea.

Maybe you could even break down the iHub into several parts, similar to the hackable outposts.

Sorry, noidea. I Found few posts with photo gallery and interviews on news portal, but still no videos from a streamfleet :(

Give to Darwinism please. Black Dragon PHP.

What do you mean? Please explain

wew these guys have an alliance history longer than all my 12 chars have corphistory together.

Querious is ours again if true!

lies

they all about died, so they asked to keep blue until they could sell their citadels.  i think they've been afk for a few months. luckily nothing too big just random mediums.
---
Neat.

We assure you that any offender in AOM will be punished accordingly. o7o7

my invasion was fit with the following:
---
not really "Spoilers" the writings been on the walls for AGES
---
It's an amazing PvP weapon.  I especially think the HAC will be pretty strong, just concerned about the price atm hopefully the new invasion will make the mats more available.
---
*second
---
It's (jokingly) become a bad omen for small gang roams I'm scouting for if we spot a Heron on d-scan.
---
The reason behind this is the fact that I usually fly something like a T3D with probes to scout our gang, and I tend to hunt targets we find tenaciously, so I'll often get sidetracked hunting "solo targets" i.e. explorer Herons while the rest of my fleet pushes forward with the roam.  On more than one occasion, this has let to our fleet getting wiped out with me being the lone exception, so now our guys have grown to be extra wary whenever we see a Heron on d-scan.
---
We've also taken this a step further, and treat my combat-probing Heron losses as "ritual sacrifices" during gate-camping fleets.
---
&gt; but so is pretending to not understand how someone could have thought that was the case.
---
first killah, now you. feelsbadman
---
I blame lag
---
Well, at least we won't be named by CCP for botting Alliance.
---
I mean go into TOP 5 botting alliance of all time in EVE is not easy for an alliance like WC which only exists for a short period of time.
---
In the end, a promise is a promise. Everyone will see how we are going to do with bots and rmt.
---
Someone out there still plays EVE the old fashion
---
hmmmm
---
And haws
---
And bosonic 
---
And jammers

---
Hendrink Collie...the one Darkness FC that I liked. It was a pleasure to go on his fleets. He treated his fleet members like actual people. I really wish he would come back and join TEST.
---
Lol, even if gsf deploys armor or shield supers, the other ones will stay behind.
---
You won't take querious without the hammer dropping on you.
---
third
---
Reminder that GOTG got waterboarded for months by two goon sigs well before main fleet arrived.
---
Whether he wanted it or not he continued griefing because he thought it was funny, giving it the very real thought. And I think he did want people to "join in on the fun", even if he did not mean for that cause someones death that is absolutely horrible and a massive misjudgement on his part.
---
And even if his call for people to grief him was completely a joke, as someone who is giving that information to hundreds of people you have to know unless you are an idiot (which mittens isn't) that some people will actually go do it, because they want to join in, because they are also sadistic and don't see the consequences.
---
This was not a simple "lol kys". This was a guy saying he had mental issues, depression, and suicidal thoughts and he wanted to grief him more. Not to mention sharing his clearly private issues on a very public forum. In context out of context this is at the very least still far more horrible then anything sort has done.
---
Seriously if you asked people which of these 2 are worse
---
1) You are playing a game and expect your private information to be kept private as normal, but someone finds out your real name and provides it to a large number (hundreds if not a thousand +) of people in the game. This information could be used to search for unhidden social media pages, whitepages information, and other generally private information that is available on the internet.
---
2) You are playing a game and potentially have mental issues and depression along with suicidal thoughts. You have been killed by some people in game and you ask them, politely, to stop or leave them alone while leaving their area.  In that message you also revealed some of your past history that led to the mental issues and depression. The leader of these people did not stop and took your message and presented it at an event for that game publically to a room of people and potentially hundreds or thousand + that are watching online. In his presentation he also called for people to continue griefing this person so they would go ahead and kill themselves as a joke. 
---
I don't think there's anyone that would say 1, that's not biased at least :|
---
talking about it is not. making a joke out of it is. I tend take the genocides against my people a bit serious. not because of some white knight bs, but because of the danger of a repeat that comes from making light of such terrible things. i dont think the sentiment changes when the number of resulting dead is fewer (Tienanmen).
---
somehow, I don't think you will do much of anything about it.
---
call it a guess
---
Because the average of 20 dudes they put in fleet for the last 6 months couldnt defend it
---
Will the independent nation of TAPI be joining this sure to be wondrous invasion?
---
But never, ever, jump gates. Perfectly balanced, no need to change them at all.
---
It was introduced in Castor as t2 shiplines
---
I'll take one. My Corp may or may not form a ridiculous kitchen sink fleet and die trying to keep it.
---
You'd have less of it with fewer blues.
---
/u/gooncuckbtw 
---
as a former slyce member i will make the offer of heckling Darkness with my own brand of Xenuria-lite until such a time as those citadels die.
---
(ps all hail our chinese overlords)
---
Simple reason -- we've both agreed to exit cleanly.
---
Also, there's a reason why PH/BL and Goons in the past didn't want to get into deep Dek and Branch and do sov warfare. I think the other day, GOTG formed 600 for a defensive Fade Tatara in Chinese/au.
---
GOTG can form up to 600 on a snap red pen for that tz.  That's a good defensive advantage, and it takes a lot of effort to remove those numbers. Sure there are coalitions that can do similar numbers if they alarm clock, but you can only do that so long before you get RL issues.
---
SO U YOURE MAKING BLADES OF ASS MK.II ??? 
---
Our Values make us  Different
---
CCP has straight-up confirmed that the major Chinese alliances have a disproportionate number of botters (see Peligro's recent tweet). 
---
It's almost like there actually is something going on here. Pointing it out is not racist and no amount of self-righteous shows of ~inclusiveness and tolerance~ will change that.
---
We will see.
---
Transferred
---
If big true
---
Jesus christ you are really steamed over something that happened 7 years ago. Mittens has already been punished. No matter how upset you get on Reddit he won't be punished again. Since this incident happened (and largely BECAUSE of this incident) the rules around what you can say were tightened. Nowadays people are held to a MUCH higher standard. 
---
You're right in that the fact CCP veteod his speech and gave it the ok before hand is likely a big part of the reason he wasn't permaed.  But the culture in game at that time was also way more toxic than it is now in general (See : DJs speech of a couple years prior where we all have a laugh about people making POS modules into swastikas).
---
take it again *
---
I allways enjoy a good discussion.
---
Sadly you are not capable of one.
---
I would like to purchase both astras for 1b each. We intend to kill bots .. and non bots. It will pair nicely with our other sov in the area. Plzkthx.
---
so you really do think its such a bizarre and absurd leap to understand why he'd think that is racist? hell you even seem to agree that it might be in some way or another(whatever that means) when you say 
---
&gt; To the point of ragebooting Slyce over it?
---
Again i'm not arguing in favor of what he did, just the sheer stupidity of the sea of " How can anyone see anything racist there!1!11!"
---
Yeah, I've gone out during big POS fights in a Noctis on a number of occasions to salvage the capital wrecks as they usually carry some of the high end modules. 
---
I made a cute little profit doing that, though I did die like 2/3 of the time.
---
Corp name?

delve is open for business again lads

I dunno, but it sounds like fun to me.

No Vacancies
---
I know... we all believe stupid things, it is always just a matter of perspective.
---
This will be interesting, if true
---
Exactly. Now imagine this everyday instead of every few weeks
---
Test took in AOM?
---
I think the so called long desired member status of the Imperium did not materialize until PanFam rejected them and attacked them.
---
Ack, can't wait until you guys are down here and blue again. o7
---
This is the greatest and best plan in the world...………..Tribute.
---
Thats a sexy headless chat bot ya got there if this is true....
---
Picking up a system is not "owning" querious... you have to take the region.
---
Also, I am pretty sure that even if you somehow manage to take the region, you will lose it as soon as gsf comes back home from whatever unholy crusade they are going on.
---
he(you)
---
The "Bot Dragon" one would be very nice :) it basically is named already of what we hunt :D
---
Never even been recommended until now, I run double neut, a nos, afterburner, long point, web and tracking disruption. Drones are my only DPS, and it's been fun so far. is MSE fitting really that good?  link fit/source?
---
I think my reply suffices either way ;)
---
Thank you very much.. we will have a lot of fun with that :D
---
Feels like this wouldn't change current gameplay too much since many not-so-heavily-defended rural systems have few sov-related structures 
---
Unless you give more penalty to defenders for not being shown up, like, lower local citadel resist
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bmncxn/slyce_kicked_from_gotg_to_protect_chinese_renting/
---
I'll take one. I just want to watch people fight to kill it
---
Why do they have to take the region? And why do you believe Darwinism wants to actually live in Sov Null lmfao
---
The main reason Stain remains isolated is because of the official lore (Sansha was exiled there by the empires after he lost the war against them). If you manage to make an event of similar magnitude, then CCP maybe will start to think about connecting back Stain to Empire space. ;)
---
I mean, by definition "querious will be ours again" sort of implies they take the region... or am I missing some nuance here?
---
Yeah, you are
---
Well it also works with a normal corporation where you have given rights or by default have them. But the less other ppl involved and also the less toons in general the safer it is.
---
They live with Frat. now
---
Fair enough, sarcasm and nuance don't translate well into text I am afraid.
---
Did you honestly expect T2 resits with 3 Rig slots and full T1 calibration?
---
Sounds like time to log off every time there is a stratop personally, fuck spending all day in 10% tidi. The times helping goons in etherium reach suck.
---
This card is allready cut and sleeved in my Erebos commander deck. :) I named the deck Avada Cadabra.

Another war? Sounds like I'll get to throw my super around so not gonna complain. If only TEST would take the opportunity to slap goons... But alas, probably not gonna happen
---
Ill have number 9 for 0 isk please.

Transfer to SpaceX Card Decks [GRODD]
---
Ill use it for content.
---
They're not the most competent bunch now are they?
---
Every bday a critical fight where you should actually face the enemy and risk something? Hmmm
---
The Trig that showed up on gate to kill my shuttle ignored CONCORD beyond scanning them with the same Entosis thingy the Sleepers and Drifters use. There was a Fortizar on grid that appeared untouched. However the invasion was CCP spawned and was in "withdrawing" state, so let's not treat this as the final answer.
---
Absolutely. Everybody knows that Imperium has a standing mandate that anyone found guilty of reporting botting will be personally visited by Mittens and his spanking machine.
---
Seriously, where the fuck do you people come up with this shit?
---
Sort's been living up to his in-game item for years...proving it time and time again. Most respectable alliances in the game have understood this for a long time.
---
So, Darwinism resides in Khanid. They've lived there for a while, since before WWB. Every so often they go in and capture the [H-6HGD](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Querious/H-6HGD) constellation, shoot the weak locals, and perma-gatecamp A2/Kaira. Then some big entity outforms them (Since they are like 60 real dudes), retakes the sov, and they go back to Khanid to blops, roam, and gatecamp.  This cycle has been repeated since at least early 2016 when Horde lived there.
---
Swing and a miss.
---
I never said it was about my small alliance - the mere presence of so many entities last night pointed to bigger things happening and if the leaks about a coming Goon invasion of the North are true then perhaps I was right.
---
My corp will take TSV. We can't do shit with it besides maybe harass people for a day till it dies, but i'd love to see one of my directors shit bricks when he sees it on our KB. Communism Incorporated.
---
&gt; Autopiloters will not be justly punished for AFK gameplay - sad indeed!
---
I look forward to seeing 'nado fleets on those gates though.
---
Shining over River.
---
Ah, so basically you are saying they will retake a constellation, probably hold it for a week, and then goons will drop their shield or armor supers (whichever one gets left behind) and retake it.
---
Makes more logical sense then Darwinism retaking a region just because half the goon supers are away lol
---
Life is Old There.
---
To further iterate on the point, Alliances weren't actually a thing in game originally either.  It took a few years of players begging CCP to add alliances to the game; before that they were just agreements between corporations like coalitions are now.
---
&gt;CCP Peligro who have access to WAY more data than you
---
His point was that Peligro hasn't posted all his data. He's posted who got banned for botting, not everyone who is botting.
---
its TurkeySandvich not RiotRick though
---
ooh, we've been upgraded from "Pet" to "SIG" sweet
---
so does this mean I can skip the fireside?  tia
---
Yeah p much. Then they will reinforce again. Then Goons will drop. Then they will reinforce, and so on, because the ADMs in that constellation will never go above 3. 
---
Then it's a fight to see who is more autistic, and my money is on Darwinism, believe it or not.
---
It's not the worst idea...Fountain is one of my favourite regions of all time, in no small part because yz- has missions that are profitable and is located dead center in the region.
---
Fair point.
---
tbh test should just team up with frat and invade delve
---
You know that it is glorious Sansha Nation that is responsible for all the WH spawning around. Sansha Nation don't need gate... capsulers do.  The Bob, god of WH is actually Citizen in The Natio n that is responsible for maintaining the WH chains
---
"exit cleanly"  lul
---
This man understands us
---
While this would have been awesome when both sides stood roughly even it is now more of hitting a dead body as long as panfam isn't getting unexpected help by legacy and skillu and shit ....
---
I'm a noob and I can't do anything cool with it or even afford to buy one but I think it would be pretty neat.
---
There. You did it!
---
Not going to try to tell you to think different, just maybe, kind of make you see what you are really doing?
---
Either you stand for it, or you don't.
---
Congrats!
---
looks interesting af
---
TIL that Snuff even has anything whatsoever to do with The Imperium lol
---
Neither is NC.
---
Rumor is the guy that killed these bots has been selling botting programs to the chinese with malware inside that allows the 'maker' to get root access. The next move is to just remote desktop to the bot machines and puts them in a position to be killed.
---
I don't think Test has reached the point where they are on par with the combined forces of PH/PL/NC.  Maybe all of Legacy has, hard to say given we haven't seen major CTAs from either to give a full picture of their respective supercap forces - including unsubbed ones who have active mains (particularly relevant for NC and PL).
---
Maybe PIBC is what is needed to push Test out of Imperium's orbit.
---
Go gooners, finish it all off and finally win the game so they can shut the servers down.
---
Haha, he actually did it. Mad Lad!

Init has been Goon's stealth bomber and boosher sig for years now, didn't ya know?

Stealth?  Mostly stukas.
---
I mean fuck, I'm biased. Of course I am. But I do truly believe that if legacy stood on it's own, and that if HRE+Frat cut ties with panfam, the game would be in a better place.
---
You would have 3.5 or 4 coalitions rather than the 2 we have right now. It's all idealistic though and not very realistic. At best, I guess we could see legacy cease helping goons and maybe deploy a sig or two to the west...
---
I don't mind 10% tidi.  Some really fun fights happen in it.
---
What I despise is when server load reaches a point where shit stops working right in 10% tidi.  Some chief ones to note were massive dread brawls, which took like an hour plus, but only spent 1 or 2 cycles in siege.

Indeed even 1 or 2 percent on a billion single items is a huge chunk.

*Prolonged exposure to GOTG may lead to Sortius Dragolosis. A horrific disease which's symptoms include, but are not limited to, the sudden urge to bend the knee, temporary homosexuality, mood swings, the sudden memory of distant relatives birthdays/anniversaries and, worst of all, a decrease in IQ of at least 50 points.*
---
*Known treatments include: Joining literally any other alliance or looking at BRs or fights that GOTG took part in.*
---
Win eve like controling all of null like PIBC did on serenity and everyone complained they did it?
---
Widot when?
---
I do not think test would deploy a sig to to the West in anything but an outright War scenario.  Both sides benefit too much from the no cloaky camping or sov wanding.  Even if test and goon stopped cooperating at the Strategic level you would still see this agreement.
---
I do agree the game would be a much better place if there were a dozen loose coalitions.  Right now there are I think seven all with strong ties to each other

Jumping [around different] npc corps.

It’s not rocket science just break down the sentence structure and use context from your story. 
---
Edit: if you need it spelled out.
---
H saying you joined a bunch of different NPC (non player character) corporations and randomly hit up the state protectorate.

They probably get a bunch of hardcore nerds who only interact with the AI.

Tl;dr he’s falling you a robosexual.

Sure thing, nubee

Trust me. It won't be risky.  There is a reason nobody invades the home regions of the major power blocks.

He doxxed himself though.  That's his right to privacy that he, himself, waived yeah?
---
They do not. They captured the systems but have zero intention of living there lmfao. They also recently lost the flag to GSF
---
Should I bother to re-sub for this?
---
Your ma's multi-pronged.
---
iirc, when you start you get put in one npc corp, then once you leave you can never return as every time thereafter if you leave a player corp you end up in another of the npc corps (but it will always be that npc corp you end up in).
---
for example when i started i was in 'science and trade institute' but every time thereafter the npc corp i end up in has been perkone.
---
yes end the game

Wonder what CSM leak is triggering this? Guess we’ll find out in a few months
---
Were those the entrance or pipe systems by any chance?
---
As someone about to start their own alliance. How do you check for botters?
---
indeed o7 07
---
Makes me rich lol.
---
To be fair we don't even need to drop supers to defend it.  It's usually subs.  If there's an escalation then of course supers get pinged.
---
You realize you're talking to the guys who burned Provi in a week, right?
---
And the other times helping goons were "guaranteed fights" that ended with A) being told 20 mins after the timer ended in blueballs that we could go home after sitting for an hour waiting and B) blueballs on a fucking raitaru armor timer followed by half an hour burning out of the constellation in gokus and losing half a dozen ships to an NC eagle fleet as we left it was a huge waste of a 325 man goku form too, we coulda killed a ton of rorqs with that. Also, 1200+ local would be pretty normal in a tribute invasion (legacy + imperium on a max form is probably 1200) and that's where unreinforced nodes really start struggling.
---
4 were pipe, 2 were off to the side. You can check this all out on dotlan if you so care

I was just poking at the person I was responding to. Their comment annoyed me so I figured I'd try to get a rise out of them.
---
I don't mind that even.  My fax lasts much longer (in real time!).  Also enjoy things like PGL/INN twitch streaming and so on.  It makes the whole thing more of an event.
---
Yet we’re still bad at the game. So nothing has changed.

Stuka bombers do have cloaks fit technically. I don't know if they have ever activated said cloaks though.

AYYYYYYYYYYY

Don't take everything you read on the internet as gospel.
---
I don't think you understand how pie charts work. This is a representation of total banned users, in numbers, by alliance. The individual slices of the pie could be represented as percentages, yes, but only of the whole, not of their individual alliances. 
---
A pie chart represents 100% of the thing its counting, by definition. Please explain how a pie chart that contained percentages of different whole numbers would accurately represent this at all.
---
In fact, gsf being so large is a point for us, not against us. Given our large numbers you would expect, assuming a baseline rate equal to other alliances, that we would show up more in raw numbers. And yet we don't.
---
You could just pass your money to us, you know
---
Sort is Haargoth?
---
They tend to do these in waves, which unfortunately does have the side effect that gives the impression that they aren't doing anything between the bouts of activity. Understandably having to address and react immediately to ever single bot-related incident would be a full-time job in and of itself. I wouldn't imagine anyone wanting that to be their sole responsibility at CCP.
---
I'm glad I don't live in a country where it's illegal to say certain things. That sets a bad precedent.
---
Wow. Enjoy your permaban...
---
If there were a Dozen loose coalitions Goons would just take turns smacking each coalition for 2-3 months and you’d get your annual rotation of who do goons want to fuck today.  Versus a Goon invasion -&gt; half game blues and stacks supers together and a stalemate war ensues. In which you see losses like the last war (10 or so Titans die, followed by a retreat). Only issue is that goons know this and have contingencies for both eventualities. The only difference is with the fax changes the critical mass for 100% success rate on titan kills is lowered because you basically only have to get then to structure and LR dreads, supers, and Titans can finish them off, even with reps.

Once you start mentioning real names and locations it no longer remains just a corp/alliance issue. At that point you've gone to far.

1) AOM now has officially started working with(for) TEST

Heya. I think some buddies could provide fireworks show w/ n:o 8. Panzer-Kunst. Ty! 😎💕👌🏾
---
I would have preferred Eve-finity war. Where half the population turns to dust at the end
---
So let me give you some correct information about what ACTUALLY happened:
---
PIBC was not the strongest alliance in serenity before the battle in 49-u6u. The fact is that almost every alliance in serenity have some degree of botting since the actual player count is too low to support the economy, at least comparing to the rate they manufacture supers. They won the battle and the server just because they got a good FC who's also excellent in social engineering, that's all.
---
You're getting yourself the survivorship bias. PIBC won, they got some botter, true. Meanwhile all and every alliance they defeated also got bot in serenity. Botting was not the key for PIBC to prevail given that every alliance there is botting.
---
Dude did I not just say like 2 days ago that someone is gunna out panfam on 2 fronts? I'm like a wizard

transferred! enjoy!

Put it under Ravensword Expeditionary Command, it's the holding corp I use for shit.

you got auto-decline on

I thought Shadowbane was more of a gay warlock name.

TBH i dont trust this statement from AOM. Hope to see actual statement from progod. He is the one should be doing the apologize in the public, not AOM's rehearsal.

Yes but they currently dont like the Kurds really really dont like them.

It is a bizarre and absurd leap to think it for more than a split second, yes, because it makes zero sense with even the slightest bit of context and thought.
---
pls don't discriminate against the Chinese people

if you profile them they might not get enough botting time in to plex their main

I mean, there are bots pretty much everywhere - but if they need an invasion excuse, shrug

There we go!

Translation:  Comrades, the 2nd alliance on the Tranquility server has taken a knee and swore fealty to the Chinese master race.

This is why I don’t like being on Test comms or attending their fleets.. Most (I’m not saying all as there’s good dudes too) have the same mentality as goons and same amount of toxicity, again I’m not saying all goons are bad dudes either..
---
I would hope so. Because Goons are basically BoB now. Strongest, unkillable capital force in the game living in delve.

You were supposed to destroy the Sith, not join them!
---
yeah, im sure the Chinese government gives a shit...  people say because they think that its going to interfere with Chinese eve players internet connectivity.  they do this because they have an impression that 'all Chinese hack or bot' and they feel this is a justified reaction.  people are fucking stupid.
---
"hey look im protesting this censorship"  - i call bull shit on this; against the current reddit circle jerk.
---
Happened last time fam. Shit all over ncdot trying to do shit in querious.
---
we know what Chinese players can do against the world already
---
Bot, bot, bot away!
---
nice bait
---
My face when 6 systems is owning querious.
---
&gt;THAT IS NOT THE AUSSIE WAY
---
Isn't your government literally doing this exact same thing though?
---
I could go either way personally...  It's kinda nice to be able to sneak out to pee and maybe grab a sandwich, while you're waiting to get lock on the primary.
---
Why? They don't want to actually live there. Other people do. Sounds like a great way to generate player versus player conflict.
---
my alliance has been growing, and the people stepping up to lead have been awesome. they’ve been doing a great job, and it’s exciting to see other players helping to bring about a vision.
---
Thousands of systems, but CCP will be happy with so many additional omega accounts.
---
The fact that dbrb could wind him up enough to get jeff to routinely yell “shut up!” At the peanut gallery so he could decipher the troll was always worth at least 5minutes of listening.
---
That is literally what the data shows...
---
I’m happy to be proven wrong in this case, but the data speaks for itself. 
---
I reckon people in the imperium love mittens more than they love the game. 
---
Regardless of what he said - how’s he gonna know if bots are reported?
---
Well you don't let them have it for ever. Just untill the lose interest.
---
But yeah the back and forth would be fun. Just sounds like something you get sick off after a while.
---
you're full of assumptions
---
did you mean to reply to the other guy or something? harassment is bad, threats are bad, exposing someone's real name like sort dragon did is bad but has a lot more room for intent or just making a mistake.
---
Steam the Krabs.
---
They havent been sick of it for 3+ yrs now so
---
&gt;Moreover, you could just as readily interpret it as a stance   
---
&gt;with  
---
&gt; the Chinese people - all the victims were Chinese students - but   
---
&gt;against  
---
&gt; the Chinese government.
---
This is what I have explained, and we disagreed. He fully has the view that mentioning this anywhere, news, broadcasts, memorials is racist.
---
Good luck capsuleer, sounds like a sweet little campaign. If you accidentally the region please rent it out ;)
---
i rejoined eve just yesterday after game support has restored my account after getting hacked months ago and i can't wait to get going again.

Are web drones ever a good solution for ships that have few mid slots?
---
An yet people say they hate foizze sov.
---
Bullshit it's clearly Banana Jatate up to no good again
---
I'm not I don't really care, as I said I don't even play anymore :p But it's just hypocritical for goons asking for action when mittens got off light.
---
An even long ago goons were very happy with gigx getting banned and that was a long time ago as well. It was a death threat so very well deserved but it still stands to mean that Mittens got off light. And again it's just hypocritical to see goons asking for action. If it was someone else no one would bring up the wizard hat ;p
---
Also just an fyi while I was going to lunch with my coworker I mentioned those 2 things just as I wrote them in 1 and 2 and she said 2 is way worse.
---
When I was a kid, anyone, who was brave enough to provoke bigger person, or to go on "enemy territory", or to act like he's tough, and that was 90-s, when there was plenty of Jackie's films, everyone called that kid like "You are what? A Jackie Chan or something?" and that was bully. Usually Jackies was 1onCountAsMuch and 've been beaten, but proud and comes back after a while.  
---
So first time i heard about JackieChan in nullsec I wasn't surpised at all.  
---
That a smart-brave or dumb-brave, but still brave person
---
Wow, that sucks :/ 
---
Here's hoping SLYCE find a new good home. I always thought they were alright.

Yea, was in a small fleet last night, and FC had to keep telling people to stop calling them ching chongs in local....like fuck frat, but not cause they are Chinese.....
---
Aw no worries mate, all space pixels.  We'll be out of here in a jiffy.  
---
To any Chinese from the mainland, I have always educated them on it as a human decency (visits to Beijing, online mainlanders, etc), and I won't apologize for it because its wiped out from their history books. I know there are those that are ignorant of this human rights issue from the West. I'm thankful though most are not.
---
The definition of racism seems to change every time I hear someone say it. There was nothing racist at all. This is just a guy trying to enforce his version of things on people via the stranglehold that is political correctness.
---
Everyone ITT who says that it wasn't racist will be labeled racists by these people.
---
I recall a certain CEO of a very large coalition ranting about "racist assholes" when they were simply stating the facts that most botters and RMTers originate from China. Apparently saying that letting in people who are known to bot will lead to increase botting is racist. How dare anyone say that a group of people could be known for something!
---
Imo they rationalize it more out of a political defensive measure to stop any argument against having new tax-payers come over in drones to these alliances. "You're so racist and must have a tiny penis and nothing going on in life, heh. That's the real reason you don't want ~~botters~~ chinese coming!" Or they may really feel this way and don't believe that groups of people can hold and display similar traits and characteristics.
---
They change the definition of racist everyday to fit their narrative and if you disagree you're a bigoted asshole who's statements are immediately cast aside. You can't reason with these people, and from my experience they don't care to be reasoned with. They just want you to accept their views and takes on things or be written off as a stupid, ignorant, bigoted racist. If you don't want to deal with these ~~tyrannical retards~~ people then don't align with them and wage war against them and their new chinese bff's.
---
Should hear them on comms tho...!
---
I thought i knew who, but half way through i realized I have no idea where it is.

Hope you feel welcomed.

Our realm have a group of dedicated pilots that helps those stranded in a wormhole space. Simps contact eve scout id you guys find yourselves lost in wormhole.

Have fun!
---
So the mangos are joining the second biggest blob in the game? Good lord, this game is going to suffer so bad.
---
The worst part is, as I have always said.. Majority of the eve community are in their late 20s and older, I can’t understand that level of immaturity, I have my moments too but that case is pretty harmless.
---
wot?
---
NC last I checked
---
It's probably easier at this point to list the alliances Test isn't blue with or doesn't have nip of some sort with.
---
I don't know what that is :( I appreciate the effort to make a noob happy. if one of them is still around later today I'll try to find that option and turn it off

We blapped a close to 1 bil pod last night.....got a 500k bounty shared among the whole fleet
---
No. The big problem with EWAR drones is that they aren't immune to stacking penalties. This means that while the first drone might web 10% speed, the second one is only doing about 8%, the 3rd 6%, and so on. If that weren't enough, web drones are very slow compared to normal light drones, meaning that they often can't catch up to or keep up with the target you are trying to web in the first place.
---
its in your corp settings, only one left so we'll see!
---
until pgl takes delve

I appreciate FW (◕‿◕✿) , even through galmil at times blobs us  (✿◠‿◠)

At least NC don't spend 5 months losing... which is more than i can say for dead co.

For a moment I thought it was Age of  Mythology. I told myself "WTF? "

If you want to get rid of jammers, take out the I-hub. Just like goons did in last summers war. The formulae for coalition invasions has not changed because jammers got a damage cap.
---

Had to re-read. First read was 'SodomyCSM'

Guy looses one VNI, “FUCKING CHINESE”, and then that attitude just spreads
---
He is to scared of goons to even think about it.

Apparently we all are.
---
Might as well go blap a rat, you’ll get the same type of bounty hahahaha
---
Thanks I'll check those out and ask around in comms
---
Ah so group protecting botters is being hit - nice!

I have no isk I bought too many gnosis but RvB will take any thank you.

wrong.

mangos are joining the second biggest blob in the game which is allied to the biggest blob in the game.

Either keep revenue from slyce and display a little loyalty or embrace all the new tasty iskies coming in from the ~~botters~~ chinese and suck a little ding dong. HMMMMMMM

go away botters

But but the Screenshots.

True Bot Lords will be hit!  ^(all pun intended)

meh not an a.t prize so couldn't care less
---
This happens because the corp you start in is a university or some other higher learning corp. This is the corp that trains you to be and makes you a pilot. After you leave however you won't re-join them because that would be the equivalent of going back to collage after you've already graduated with a doctorate because you want to live in there dorms again.
---
Show bobs and vagabond
---
Lol i do, PVE fuels my PVP cause we dont get any isk from it.
---
@GigxDidNothingWrong
---
Idk if it’s just me because I’ve been playing pvp games since I got my hands on an online game or there’s just something wrong with people, but outside of a battle I don’t feel any type of way towards anyone, it’s a game, we’re supposed to have fun.
---
Just an example, I was gate camping in our system and a guy from the bastion ended up in my bubble, had a fair 1v1 fight and he got blapped and I missed his pod.. Both of us say gf in local and I told him he can go back home, then he’s like “thanks because I forgot to change my training pod” So I ask him to wait a few mins, I went to our staging as it was 3 jumps away and got him a travel atron, in exchange I asked him to destroy it once he gets back home if he even made it back.. 
---
A little bit of respect even towards your enemy goes a long way tbh, sooner or late it might pay off.
---

My point was FRT along with many other groups have way more money, I don’t see why they shouldn’t do the same thing as it gives an incentive to do certain things, in our case to hunt people down in our territory and keep it even safer..
---
&gt; legacy + imperium on a max form is probably 1200
---
Then you won't need to worry about TIDI. Who is going to fight 3/4ths of nullsec?
---
Having roamed GOTG pets space recently it has so many VNI bots its not even funny.
---
Yea i hear you. I guess the incentive for us is we cant safely rat and shit unless they are dead, so if we want to continue grinding isk, we gotta kill them
---
For all the talk, TAPI is really just another Goon pet alliance.
---
Yeah who is going to do that? The 20 slyce dudes who always showed up for fleets?
---
Also, how is your AUTZ numbers? Sov war with that massive timezone tank isn't easy.

There is a gate camp that will probably kill you. Or you may not have access to the station.

One might say he took a hands off approach
---
perhaps if ncpl weren't so unbearably toxic it would be different, alas

or it's because they're able and willing to absolutely destroy this game we love just as they destroyed their own private server, just as they've destroyed every other mmo with an organized Chinese presence, just as they've destroyed every other multi-player game with their complete disregard for rules
---
Lies! Nixon is just standing straight up...
---
Then hate them for that, doesnt excuse the pricks out their calling them ching chongs in local.
---
Of course the more movement and people rolling through an area the more difficult it is to bot. Both because of people blowing up the bots and disrupting them as well as more people reporting them.
---
I do agree that making the bot infested territories more accessible will help from both these perspectives.
---
All planned at the BBQ.

Also, how fucking hilarious and ironic would it be if TEST helped goons with this. Imagine fighting to liberate the north from the imperium, then bending the knee to help the imperium take back the north or whatever is happening.
---
There is a in game chat channel for hauling that can help you out.
---
Also reaching out to know hauling corporations like Pushx and Redfrog. They know all the ways people will try to scam you and can help you out.
---
No u
---
We also offer 10m per Frat ship kill.
---
Ha ha you're poor.
---
I’m a damn fool. Are you saying eve is free to play? I can fly all my old ships and shit and not pay a monthly?
---
Yes, I pointed out that major Chinese alliances have a disproportionate number of botters, as confirmed by CCP.
---
I happily stand by that statement.
---
It gets really childish. The Chinese contingency of winterco normally takes it in stride, but it does piss them off. I hope TEST actually does correct their members behavior as it's a shitty thing to do. We enjoy the fights, not that garbage.

Half of the time you take off the cloak to fit more stuff. And I have seen cloaked stukas used as scouts and warp-ins.
---
activate the module, then any target that begins to aggress you while it is cycling will then be locked by your ship if able to do so.
---
if the module isn't active, it won't target things back. if you activate it AFTER they initially aggress you then it won't attempt to target them back.
---
I, for one, have gotten tired of krabbing. Thanks for the heads up!
---
How does galmil blob you guys with 1/20th the playerbase
---
is there a link to this info or just a reddit post. clarity would be nice. if true good luck to all the pilots involved we will see you in tribute soon &lt;3
---
You need to get paid to pew? We just like to fight. No incentive needed.
---
Public courier contracts are very often scams.

In case this question isn't rhetorical, one difference is that the Holocaust was motivated by antisemitism, whereas Tianamen Square was purely political and not racially motivated.

---
Yer da sells Avon.
---
You underestimate my power!!
---
Don't compare NC to GOTG, they have huge spacedicks
---
You are walking into a scam. The idea is to trick you into taking a freighter on one trip through low sec.
---
There are ways to avoid this, plan your route and don't just use the waypoint setter and look out for busy periods before you go in.
---
Then there's the old only fly what you can afford to lose, so if the collateral is too high, don't pay it.
---
Did the same thing when buying up abyssal mods. 1.5 bill though instead of 1.5mil, was early so it hurt xD still have that stinkin module too
---
Still more fights than tama these days
---
Fuck you no. Shitting on revisionist dictatorships is not racism.
---
but my eve already do this in the settings, it has an auto-target back feature up to 12 ships, isn't it the same thing?
---
There are better ways to make money without the risk of getting scammed as a new player. If you don't mind some risk, looting/salvaging battlefields in null is what I got my buddies to do when they started. Join a major alliance and tag along on stratops then loot the field. They were making 250-500mil after battles. Bring  cheap frigates and focus on expensive modules.
---
If you don't want that risk, mining and mission running will get you better money than hauling contracts without the risk of being scammed.
---
there are two kinds of clones now, unpaid (alpha) and paid (omega) clones.
---
mostly the same restrictions (and a few additional ones) during the old free month of playtime for a new character are in effect for the unpaid clones
---
so probably not all your old ships
---
We need a wedding
---
Which ever will you choose?
---
Maybe the others should try not being so awful? I know its a novel strategy for the north but, if they weren't all so terrible to the point working with each other is like swimming through custard they wouldn't have such trouble making friends and working with them.
---
Who am I trying to kid though, we all know the old guard is going to stay in the same positions making the same mistakes they always have.
---
It's the bot war
---
i think that targets anything that targets you - rather than aggresses you.
---
terrible idea. what would the point of jammers be as a separate structure? why would you make an alternative to reffing the jammer that's even more aids and also takes longer? you talk about "a window of opportunity", but it would be 48 hours, much longer than currently.
---
the very same people moaning about how jammers suck are the people who wanted them to be uber strong and to have no-fatigue jump gates. the CSM was literally praising the jump gate mechanics at the last summit, when anyone who plays the game can see they're broken. maybe if your leaders weren't such abject cowards you wouldn't be stuck having aids wars under jammers versus ginormous blobs
---
It can be turned on and of easily, and it also lets you target additional ships
---
I'm trying to remember INIT doing anything useful from Hakonen.
---
He wants his hands......
---
......"off"
---
I'm trying to remember NC doing anything solo of note in all of time.
---
Not all of them but you can fly lots of ships without paying monthly. Enough to sit in local and even participate in the subcap fights
---
True, but who doesn’t love getting paid to do something they love?
---
No we do not. It’s a great idea though. I need to get one setup.
---
only heterosexuals can notice the dot in the 665m isk contract
---
It's not about joining the north, it's about not joining the strongest forces to be risk free.
---
I loved Deklein protector. he was my friend
---
I am so surprised
---
But can he pull out 500 Titans?
---
Are you saying this is what Mango is trying to do to Tranquility? Cuz it make sense
---
Never end part is the best part.

No I get that. Just dont think it's a necessity:p

---
Nevermind.
---
I think the period of time that INIT was last truly relevant is long gone dude.
---
That’s where panfam is deploying shortly after fireside
---
eve does that, at least it's what happens to me, if a ship targets me, without attack, my eve already target back ... maybe this module feature was not native to the game, and not that it is, it's basically useless, only reason to use it it's for the bonus I think
---
20 people is being very very Generous dude, Slyce has put the Dead in Dead Coalition for a long time now.
---
Much Memes have been had when Theran Alliance who is 1/4 the size of Slyce but regularly out forms them in Fleets
---
Still in ER.
---
Slowest purge ever.
---
you don't always want to be locking things just because they target you.
---
that's a good way to end up shooting your own logi.
---
&gt;Why can't the north work together?
---
Because it's a game and it's a lot more fun if groups stay relatively similar in terms of power. Tell me how fun Serenity is. Tell me how fun Tranquility is going to be in 5 years down the road if the current trends continue.
---
Fair point. Fact is, no one has really complained about it. Not sure it's a factor.
---
so is it then allowable to hate Chinese players because they're botting and ruining a game you love and express that idea as long as you don't say ching chong?
---
See, this is what im talking about, puts it on full display in one line.
---
&gt; 'It's about making a bad decision to not facilitate rapid growth to please people who don't have your interests in mind'
---
Goddamn they should listen to people like you, they'll be a powerhouse in no time with such sage advice.
---
I thought goons sided with botters more often than not.
---
Botting was not the key, Lol.
---
PIBC started botting and RMT workshops, is that true? No one can deny this.
---
Which forced every player to use a bot. Cause if you don't use bot to mine, you will never be competitive (the truth was, even if you do, you cannot defeat workshops) you started it, you are to blame. and obviously, no other alliance, as you mentioned, with some bots,  even they were all united in the 49-u6u fight, had the ability of give out a new Titan to any Titan loss immediately as PIBC can do
---
With a much shorter time of development, and much less real player, back to the 49-u6u war, PIBC had more Titans than Goons does now in 2019, and they even have bots to operate super capitals at the same time to fight together. 
---
Don't tell me that you don't know these
---
**2 Excavators blow up**
---
No doubt in that, but I was talking about PVE, then you land into a pocket with 10-30 rats.

That’s for test only isn’t it?
---
&gt; Because it's a game and it's a lot more fun if groups stay relatively similar in terms of power.
---
You mean like BoB and MC back in the day? PL at the height of their helicopterdicking supers power yeah? Someone is always going to be on top lording it over the plebs, why not try and make it you again instead of impotently complaining that it no longer is?
---
&gt; Tell me how fun Tranquility is going to be in 5 years down the road if the current trends continue.
---
You lot lower down the totem pole up north need to get your acts together and start offering up some resistance instead of slowly decaying on the vine with a has been HC then. Takes two to tango and right now you've got no legs, don't expect me to chop mine off to get down to your level.
---
Dreddit is Recruiting!
---
I run my Vedmak in darks. Never underestimate extreme tracking and utility highs
---
We still don't have that sabre BPO though.
---
I mean GOTG paid for a period of no-cloakycamping for his allies and he was thanked by his allies invading him or standing idly by, and now he's the one in the wrong for literally going tit for tat?
---
Just try a lil bit harder you’re almost there boom roasted
---
Feels like a scarlet quote...
---
We’re on the same side remember? Haha

you need to move within the site. Also you prolly can fit a Ballistic Control or 2, havent tested it tho. It definetly works with this setup.
---
If it was 'the Avon' you'd have got my upvote.
---
Mine already is
---
This should really shock no one
---
&gt; How does galmil blob you guys 
---
friend, when they go 10 to 1 isn't that a blob?
---
Just announced, Test is helping AOM settle in Omist.
---
Honestly, Serenity was doomed by bots, we failed fighting it, some even joined the bots players then Serenity had a ridiculous market.
---
If they come here for regular playing, it should be totally fine and they are absolutely welcome.
---
Considering hundreds of bots got banned in the most recent two weeks which was right after they announce their immigration to Tranquility, I kinda doubt that.
---
CHING CHONG racism CHONG CHINGY
---
Lol you're absolutely correct here. So many morons on Reddit talk out of their ass on legal matters. Doxxing isn't incitement
---
You win!
---
You are joking, right?
---
So 90% of Eve then. Ok.
---
Idd...according to NC.  he was just suppose to take it.I mean GOTG have been outcast by Panfam for sometime now so what did they expect ? Foolish I tell ya.
---
THIS IS NOW A WIDOT THREAD.
---
Avoid lowsec at all cost. Avoid nullsec. Only move things in highsec. Avoid obnoxiously high collateral cause someone may be hoping to suicide gank you.
---
Its a doable career but the smart people are usually transporting multiple couriers from place to place in one trip or doing market trading primarily and courier to fill their loads.
---
very noob question: are all the orange shield hardeners active modules? I though they were passive...
---
People have been gatecamping and dropping dreads and without much issue when I log in. I generally solo roam outside of delve since npc delve doesn’t engage.
---
I left GOTG by then
---
All goonies have to do is just drive around in their fleets of titans and kill every keepstar in the game. It's not like anyone could realistically stop them from doing it.
---
well lets face it, both Hakonen deployment was a complete joke...
---
Think... NC... pick one.
---
This is what PL did for 4 years when I was there. Slapped AAA, Brave, Test, Goons, everyone. The only real pressure came when the revenant went down, and after wwb.
---
I think you might be taking an all-or-nothing view of the word "form". Every sov-holder should have to maintain some form of standing defense fleet (at least during their active times). Most alliances do, and there really isn't that much difference between small gangs hunting ratters to get a response and small gangs hitting timers to get a response. Right now, many groups answer the former with "dock up--they'll get bored and go away" and the latter with "dock up--they won't come back for the next timer".
---
If I understand the OP's suggestion correctly, it will make docking up a less viable option for timers, leading to more ships in space, which seems healthy for the game.
---
I'm sorry that 400 to 450 total people couldn't annihilate 5000?
---
They took our jobs
---
And bingo was his name ooooo
---
Shame .... shame .... shame.
---
I wonder: Who will do The Walk?
---
A blob that silently stopped the war against frat.
---
I for one welcome our bot overlords.
---
Jesus Hedliner, that was brutal.
---
yo what happened to Reavers? I know a hedliner gimmickpost isn't the place to get my intel, but i notice it isn't mentioned there and i saw ratknight and some of the other reavers d-squad schlepping around in a lowsec structure-bash fleet a few nights ago
---
If a boy wanted to fly a Chemosh, what are the routes for being able to do so?
---
LMK because I have a beach trip I’m organizing for PL that we’ll be in that area ish in September
---
Yeah, but now imagine the impossibility of anyone fighting goons 1 on 1. 
---
The helicopter dicking PL did in the past was really bad, goons could be worse if not for huge coalitions. 
---
But unfortunately that leads us to our present day. There are only two sides in eve. PL/NC. Or Goons. Everyone is the game has affiliations with one side or the other if they exist in nullsec. 
---
The first persons to break out of that are going to be the sacrificial lamb, which is why no one is doing it.
---
It’s a meme that mocks your retarded point of view.
---
Tall in the hall.
---
Yeah lets team up with the botting faggots that elo is currently nursing lmao
---
&gt; You lot lower down the totem pole up north need to get your acts together and start offering up some resistance
---
No they don’t.
---
The only thing the QFC fights are anomalies, poorly.
---
Racist!
---
Hahah.. so true...
---
That is definitely problematic. As someone that still gets occasional phone calls from 4chan, you have my sincere condolences.
---
So....there are gatecamping titans now?
---
Gonna have to throw you an up vote for that reply good sir.
---
I keep what I'm willing to lose due, so about 2B. Buying a 1.4B cyno isn't so bad, a 14B one would be much worse.
---
Today is the day we announce our allegiance to TEST on the tranquility server. After much discussion, we’ve finally arrived at an agreement and we would like to thank those involved in the negotiation process. Much thanks to their straightforwardness and sincerity. PGL will announce in their alliance internals this news, welcoming AOM to Tranquility and our alliance. He also expresses his regret the unfortunate attitude towards the Chinese people that arose from the war with FRT/WC and his commitment to respecting and welcoming us with hospitality. This hospitality and respect will form the basis for our bond and bolster our long term war strategy. We as AOM will also work hard to return the favor with respect and show the entire Tranquility server the tenacity, honesty and the quality of Chinese players. Here we vow our beliefs against botting, RMT and any violations of that will see severe punishment by the alliance. There is no place for RMT in AOM.
---
 “A small step for PIBC, a giant leap for the Tranquility Chinese community”
---
~~TIL Hedliner is bad at propaganda.~~ 
---
Wait, I already knew that. 
---
TIL nothing.
---
&gt; the CSM was literally praising the jump gate mechanics at the last summit, when anyone who plays the game can see they're broken. maybe if your leaders weren't such abject cowards you wouldn't be stuck having aids wars under jammers versus ginormous blobs
---
The OP's flare is for TEST and yours is Goons. You do realise that TEST has no CSM representation whilst Goons have more than half the seats, right?
---
I'm curious, has anybody seriously expected this to work?
---
So a confirmed scarlet quote.
---
Honorbound Pheonix
---
They can always be fine with wallowing in the gutter I suppose, takes all sorts.
---
Oplex t1 frig bots make more isk than a vni does.
---
Init have 5155 toons, NC PL have 5863 combined... your arguement is as invalid as it gets
---
A prime example of how CCP have neutered risk/reward. Autopiloting saves you effort so you can AFK but the risk is you can get blown up. It should be no different with this.
---
It's almost like someone remembers the Drifter Incursions...
---
How are they going to hunt without any way to make money or make sure there actually is someone in system?
---
True, but idk if I'd say that's EASY to see, and that's hardly true of every bot, and definitely not the even halfway intelligent operators.
---
This rental corp use CNY to pay rent .  yup , not isk . that is RMT.
---
i always thought their[Ranger Regiment] RMT was known by many people. But now it looks like just chinese knows.
---
Gemini Whale United , this alliance is RR rent corp .  ))
---
That's a question with either a very simple or a very complicated answer.
---
The simple answer is get the skills listed here [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Chemosh](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Chemosh) and have fun.
---
The complicated answer starts with a few more questions. First, what is your isk-flow like right now? If you aren't already space-rich, and I'm assuming you aren't, then you will need to sort out your economy before you can go for the big ship. I'm not certain, since there aren't any Chemoshes on the market, but I'm guessing your target number is in the 10s if not 100s of billions of isk. Second, what contacts do you have? I'm not an expert on capitals, let alone pirate ones, but it looks like you get Chemosh blueprints from a Blood Raiders FOB? You're not going to run that on your own, so you either need to hang with a group that can run one with you or make friends with a group that can run one and is willing to sell the blueprint to you afterward. Third, how are your industry skills? If you can't make the ship yourself, you'll need a friend you trust to build it for you. See also: get some contacts. Fourth, how do you intend to fit and use your Chemosh once you have it? That's an expensive ship, so start thinking about use now before you invest in a $1000 paperweight.
---
no
---
Actually it kind of was too much to ask. The couple of times they tried to hell camp, they lost capital ships like fools, and it didn't help it was not their strongest timezone when we operated.

 rooty poop (noun)  
---
\\ ˈrü-tē püp    
---
Definition of rooty poop   
---
1 : a very dull or stupid person : FOOL   
---
2 : something very small or insignificant ie: brain   
---
3 : typical Goonswarm line member   
---
4 : Sort Dragon   
---
In a sentence: "What a bunch of rooty poops"
---
Way better than the current season of GOT
---
The level of immaturity has to deal with people hiding behind their screen names and other things about the internet. They all scream about their privacy and in the same context are willing to hide behind it like it is their armor and shield but people want to act like assholes on the internet instead of mature individuals. If people acted in public as they do on the internet, they would get their ass beat in no time flat.
---
I mean all it takes is for CCP to take no actions and somebody with a little bit of a media connection to make sure it becomes a story.
---
You might want to look elsewhere for that title
---
Train or inject into it, then earn lots of ISK. They show up for sale every now and then in places like the [EVE forums](https://forums.eveonline.com/c/marketplace/sales-ads). If you are part of a larger null block you can also try asking around as someone way have one they are willing to part with. The other option is to find and run a Blood Raider Sotiyo, and hope it drops the BPC you want. They aren't piratically soloable however, and you will have lots of competition as there are only a couple in the game at any one time.
---
I'm not questioning your honor, Sort Dragon. I'm denying its existence. \~\~\~
---
Maybe I should start playing the bingo. Is it a drinking game?
---
-&gt; so many people pvp in delve, look the killboard of delve
---
-&gt; all this people will find bot and of course as a good goon gater or just like me (want a clean game) will report them
---
-&gt; after each investigation; if botting is found, these guys are permaban. If tgey are not banned we can assume they are not bot.
---
The statistic doesnt lie, i m sorry for your fantasm.
---
Too much ennemy in delve to make your story true.
---
Try actively promoting Jihadism while promoting the establishment of the one true god state and see how far that gets you in your little utopia.
---
I mean, if you want to believe the entire north wasn't showing up daily for our fleets I can pretend that narrative is accurate.
---
I really need to attend more Firesides.
---
Had amazing small gang and solo content this week already, met and shot great people.  (◕‿◕✿) 
---
If SLYCE is looking for content and a new, old home: there is still your sov in Scalding nobody touches. We could use some more EUTZ content here.  (✿◠‿◠)

Barleguet deployment against INIT last year.  Was p much a 1v1 and INIT got dumpstered.
---
For example.
---
There is always some shitter in a large groupe, i tend to move to a specialist channel or the quiet room because of that...
---
what is : dscan
---
also frigates are dirt cheap,.

Is that the meal or the restaurant?

You using implants or something? showing over in CPU with perfect skills in Pyfa

sorry! they've all been transferred
---
CO2 is still a Corp in Pandemic Horde, I wouldn’t be surprised if Gigx was already back and has just been keeping a lower profile to avoid the banhammer
---
I havent played for long, but huge props to goons that they can do whatever the fuck they want and didnt show up on the botting graph (cause theyre botting in enemy alliances but thats smart gameplay). 
---
However what is up with INIT and Snuff? Arent they strong alliances? Why do they need to gang up with Goons against enemies goons can take on themselves? Do they lack capable FC's or memberbase to stand on their own?
---
Thank you! I always wanted to shit up local in VFK.
---
Excellent whataboutism, good sir. Please post your real name and address so we can send you your prize.
---
The enemy alliance will fight aginst a small power bloc of pilots. The GOTG coalition will form small fleets.
---
The problem is you hit like 40% tidi moving through a constelation at that point.
---
LOL
---
Funny when foreigners don't know a language and say random shit and it doesn't make sense at all. From what I can gather from the chinese in this, you are trying to talk about a 500 year old winnie the pooh man from Tibet that has a part time job as a prostitute, wants to live for another 500 years and is a bad driver
---
I think that’s a clever approach, at least you stay away from all the bullshit and drama and stick with your own little circle for the most part..
---
What do they expect will happen after this little 'invasion' is over?
---
for botters*
---
:slowpoke:
---
You no longer require docking access to deliver items to upwell structures, but you could still get attacked on the outside of it I suppose
---
https://i.imgur.com/FqOShyQ.jpg
---
Yeah, allow us to love it...what is it?
---
Looks like meats back on the menu boys.
---
Oh you are not wrong about that, I feel like people say shit on the internet because they can’t say the same shit in real life, just for their e-peen to look bigger.. But honestly I would also bust a lot people’s teeth in for the shit they say, but I’m playing games for fun, nothing else.
---
Like for example, you’re from SF, I don’t really like you guys but that’s nothing personal, it’s the way you guys play and have fun, but I’m not gonna go bash you, talk shit and be toxic over a game, makes no sense..
---
you mean why can't init and snuff 2 relatively mid sized alliance take on one of the biggest super-cap umbrellas in the game by themselves? you tell me genius
---
the only thing sort dragon has ever successfully skull fucked is his reputation as a credible leader
---
So are slyce keep keepstars or what
---
there was an attempt at papa roach
---
Seems disappointingly lacking in absurdisms for Hedliner.
---
Should still be possible to fight them tbh. But for that there has to form a new big coalition out of panfam legacy and all the other shit living in the east but as they hate each other ... rip.
---
In over ten years of Eve now, the best time I've had in Eve was when CO2 was in Impass.
---
However, after that, and the attempts to resurrect CO2, it just wasn't the same.  It was honestly pretty horrible.
---
I don't think gigX should have been perma-banned for being emotional, but I don't think his return now will have the impact hoped for.
---
Generally alliances in Eve join the winning side in any conflict which tends to make wars short and catastrophic for the loser.
---
Is it still called widot when it's an entire coalition?
---
I noticed you happened to leave out the *minor* detail that it's illegal ban people for running bots in China.
---
That's kinda an important bit of information about why bots proliferated so much on Serenity.
---
&gt; It is a bizarre and absurd leap to think it for more than a split second
---
well but if you thought for that split second you already know how he could've come to that conclusion, and that's my point.
---
My government isn't currently harvesting prisoners there organs right now, if they where i would be the first the public point that out to as many people willing to listen and yes i live in a country that profited massively from the slave trade, but criticizing the current anti-slavery government for that seems counter productive, now if the current government was pro-slave trade i would likely be more critical of that history. 
---
The problem with the current Chinese government is that they are harvesting prisoners there organs not 50 years ago but today and more people should known that.
---
I used to feel the same way, but now i hate simple farmers so i can't say i don't hate anyone.
---
I dont even know what to say.
---
Wait, people get *paid* to kill botters?
---
I dunno, is it?
---
CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK
---
What's the over/under on the number of Keepstars either blown up or unanchored?
---
Fair point, one of them replied to me and I said the same.. I don’t like them because of the things they do, but it’s nothing personal, it’s their play style and their way of having fun.. If I see a SF post, I’m not gonna flame the person like some people do to their “enemies” and if I saw one irl I’m not gonna get into a fight with me just for being SF..
---
My point is, some people take games too serious and look too deep into things, we’re all here to have a good time and that’s it.
---
The first ship I jump in (phoenix) uses passive shield hardeners. The second ship I get into is a broadsword, which has native good shield resists. You use active hardeners on ships that arent super susceptible to neuts.
---
I actually checked what account i used to post this.
---
Bring neuts and he'll eat shit to a quarter that number of dudes.
---
Are unrated combat sites worth running? Seems like people prefer DED sites more? I ran a dozen unrated sites in low sec, and only one dropped something of value (a faction stasis webifier + implant, worth 120m all together). Probing and running those dozen sites took me a few hours, so I calculated my isk/hr to be around 60m. 
---
A few of those sites escalated. I decided to follow one escalation to its conclusion, and EVERY escalation dropped nothing of value. All up, that took another hour, but I'm not sure if I was simply unlucky.
---
Where are slyce going to go.  Any space been offered?
---
If that is what AOM(PIBC)told you test members to prove something...mmm...
---
Banning bots is legal in China, there was a case the bot player who got banned won the lawsuit. But the agency eventually figured that problem out. Tiancity which was the agency running the game banned thousands of botting accounts during those years.
---
You must be Civire.
---
The default corp for Civire is Caldari Provisions.
---
See 'NPC Starter Corporations' and 'Default Corporations':
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/NPC_Corporations#NPC_Starter_Corporations
---
When you finish the tutorial, you get moved to the default corp.  Same whenever you leave a player corp.  The game mechanics require that you always belong to a corp.
---
Praise Geese.
---
I approve of my new geese overlords.
---
Even tho you have some of the best FCs in the game, people like you is the reason why Test will always be a shit tier alliance
---
NC. controls alliances with 16% bans for botting/RMT - based on the CCP data.
---
/r/eve in a nutshell
---
Wow what amazing news, Vily and PGL cant see 2 foot in front of them so they do the most obvious thing and try to roleplay big brother like people did for TEST and let AOM bot and buy skill injectors/titans on their couch. So AOM can join Legacy and own the blue donut from paragon soul to insmother.  All the while contributing to the actual slow death of eve. 
---
Top tier strategy guys. Im blown away by these top minds.
---
Are you dumb, is. Yes. get yout head out of your ass.
---
Most alliances only care about the rules if it benefits them.
---
Mfw enough isk to buy a supercarrier is poor.
---
I can do that here, if I want, without fear of arrest and/or imprisonment.
---
In fact if you live in Germany you can do that there too, but only if you are of a certain origin.
---
I look forward to seeing a wealth of new bots to put on my killboard.
---
idk who is dumber this guy or the guys that dropped on him with 4 dreads lol.
---
Hrm...trust guy on Reddit with obivous axe to grind....or trust [CCP Peligro](https://np.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9l55k9/serenity_rmt_built_straight_into_the_game/e75rbtk/)....
---
So hard to decide....
---
Boi, you don't speak French to Korean. People adapt to "rules", and botting was the rule in China so it's considered "legit" there. As they now form their force in OUR server, you should be expecting a new good leader rise, not just "another" botter. 
---
FYI, we already have enough botter and workshop in tranquility, AOM would not have the impact you're trying to exaggerate (or should I say black mail?) The part you should be concern about is how CCP can fuxk with all existing bots instead of blaming AOM only.
---
So the Chinese left serenity to tranquility, and nothing changed other than grrrrr bots....
---
It’s an entry wristband
---
I knew it, I knew we were overdue for a Tribute war.
---
Hi welcome!
---
Gigx getting banned was literally last year, and he threatened to fucking mutilate someone IRL.  Like the made the distinction that he meant IRL instead of in game to make it a real life threat.
---
You must have missed a good portion of 2018.
---
I would only go as far as only talking business with someone if i found out they were SF. I only flame people who cause irl harm. In game this just comes down to not saying gf to them and making fun of them while they run away with their tail tucked firmly between their legs.
---
I guess move onto Frat/skillu, which should be quick, then we can go play another game?
---
Suddenly saving krabs seems to be a much more attractive option
---
Because most alliances don’t need to pay their members in order to have them kill intruders
---
Red wedding
---
To be a pet requires dependency, and they aren't really dependent.  I think that TAPI and Goons share a similar culture and similar goals... but it is more like an NC/PL relationship then it is a GSF/INIT relationship. just my 2c
---
unironically this
---
The thing with unrated Complexes is that it’s just way easier to farm escalations that have better chance of good loot anyway. For example, I live in Sansha space (nullsec) and I can smartbomb sites and get 6/10s faster than if I scan them, on average. Plus escalated sites are safer, because someone needs combat probes to find you. One thing that might be confusing though is that you can scan naturally occurring DED sites, which don’t come from escalations, so if you are scanning and running sites you’ll be running half rated and half unrated.
---
This is very common for German alliances to happen, but it generally tends to not become a massive issue.
---
Aussies not soul sucking politicians
---
They can be worth running, but not all of them are. Check out the EVE-Uni wiki on the [topic](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Combat_sites).
---
You are right. SLYCE is the next alliance turned corp to join Pandemic Horde.
---
CCP has now set the precedent that status grants special privilege in regards to ban reviewal. This is pretty unfair to people who have been unrightfully banned in the past and received no second review of their ban.
---
Part of the issue, imo, is human nature and therefore the nature of the game.  The game is as much about your ability to deploy forces as it is your ability to make allies.  GSF has a substantial fleet of super capitals.  Could it stand against ALL of the rest of EVE? I doubt it.  There is a huge benefit to TAPI and Imp working together on things like no cloaky camping (allowing their members to more easily make money and buy ships), and on the strategic level (see GSF mobilizing shield supers to aid TAPI during fight against PL).  
---
Until there is a mechanic change that flips the cost benefit so that large blocs shouldn't exist... they will exist.
---
no one is 'blaming AOM only', and botting was not a rule for any Chinese player, we hate botting.
---
I want people to be aware of what could happen, as I said, if they came for regular play, they are absolutely welcome.
---
And you are right, fighting bots is a thing across entire tranquility. I sincerely hope AOM adapt them self to 'rules' so we will have more active players. 
---
I also hope I was exaggerating something, but I was not
---
What about his renters
---
You should trust CCP Lol, they are earning a living on this, not like any of us
---
It was legit the entrance pocket we just finally got around to caring enough to do something
---
Chinese DPI really isn't that good, keep in mind before the name go's over the wire there are 2 layers of encryption ( ccp's and well w/e VPN there using to by pass the block of western games ).
---
Most Chinese people inside china are aware something happened in tiananmen square, now what there generally not aware of is that the rest of the world known better what happened then they do as a lot of the story about it in china is well rumors.
---
CCP have 'policy' of not applying new rules to old cases.
---
At least that's what they claimed about the wizard-hat incident.
---
Looking to buy?
---
We've seen the result of Goons and TAPI and their blobs in UALX and X47. Given the numbers disparity, there's not really a reason to even fight. Better to just let them kill a few keepstars and then get bored and go home after 2 weeks.
---
I think it was partly Asher taking a break and partly giving some of the other US TZ squads a chance to spread their wings.
---
As soon as reavers start going out again, a lot of the people in that sig immediately drop everything else in the game and do it.
---
As for structure bashing, I am pretty sure that is 90% of what reavers do, lol
---
&gt; is responsible for all the WH
---
not all the wh but they can open their own  
---
&gt; The Bob, god of WH is actually Citizen in The Natio n that is responsible for maintaining the WH chains
---
 &gt;opens permanent lowsec wh to stain  
---
 &gt;is frig hole
---
rules for thee, but not for me.
---
Cause true bots are in goons proper, ofc.
---
You did to kick us out monkaHmm
---
That would be blobbing yes. I'm just surprised they have room to blob anyone.
---
I would simply affiliate my in game name with my real life name, publicly declare slander and that i will seek reciprocation through every means available. It worked for Brisc
---
I need to move more solo ships to NPC south then, this will be fun.
---
As opposed to the ones in KWG?
---
Maybe you should get you're story right :P He was banned before he just returned last year and CCP waffled a bit on getting him banned until the goon CSM rightly brought up that he's circumventing his ban. He was originally banned in 2017. 
---
Also his threat wasn't specifically targeted "I'm going to get you IRL" though it certainly implied so. Gigx was always a piece of shit and certainly talked that way A LOT (that wasn't a singular instance), much like Mittani, and certainly deserved his ban.
---
If you're going to take Gigx's "you better use your hands to type while you still can comment" like that you should absolutely also take Mittani's "harass this guy so he'll kill himself" comment at the same face value. The guy was talking about suicidal thoughts in real life, Mittani said harass to kill himself, it was also in real life. He was not saying kill yourself in game. And not only did he say this in a chat channel like gig did he said out loud, in person, while showing this person's mail with his mental history to a room of people and those watching.

What kind of delusion is this? :|

When the Devs do everything they can to kill a game, don't blame the players for taking up their call.

Anti-Zionism is anti-semitism? But Zionism is ethno nationalism. I thought that was racist and evil. Or is that just when white people do it?

Actually 10%, NA. is dead. But look at Shdow of Death and Solar. Lots more there.

I know I know, but you can still do percentages as a bar chart :P
---
Got it...and looking at it on a larger screen I can see the year.  Thanks!
---
I remember it as well as the sequel: Bobby Atlas Goes Out For Chicken Wings.
---
This excuse is getting tired. You know you can shoot NC/PL without being blue to everyone who isn't NC/PL right?
---
&gt;However what is up with INIT and Snuff? Arent they strong alliances?
---
no we are weak and small god I hope no one tries to invade fountain we won't last a week
---
;P
---
I might be better off with the X series. I just don't care for players fucking me up. It's not the same.
---
1. Never undock in a ship you can't afford to lose.
---
2. If the deal looks too good to be true, it is. Don't trust public contracts.

NC. 2019 ... 10% rmt/botting imprint on New Eden is fine

Kkkkrab mode on

tbf he's always prioritised people who give him money
---
Frist you need a Bingo card, Second you need to go out side to were it is busy were you live get naked and start screaming BINGO !
---
Courier contracts require a LOT of start-up capital for collateral.  Typically you'll want to have up to a billion.
---
Just ignore lowsec and nulsec contacts.  There are legit ones, but they are extremely high-risk, and require exceptional care and preparation.
---
Expect to earn around 100k to 250k per hisec gate.
---
There are a lot of scams.  Contracts with high collateral that can't be delivered, or that will have a gate-camp of gankers ready once you accept the contract.
---
Also, contracts for packages that are very large and can only be delivered with certain ships at high or max skill.
---
Small packages with high collateral and high reward are not likely to be scams, just lazy people with more ISK than will to move stuff they bought themselves.
---
Hauling is high-risk, especially when you are in an easily destroyed ship.
---
DON'T AFK haul!
---
Deep Space Transports (DST) are great for medium cargo in hisec.  They are rather slow though.  Using one in lowsec or nulsec requires more know-how than a beginner should attempt.
---
Blockade Runners (BR) can haul around 8,000 m3, but should always be cloaked.  I've personally hauled upwards of 80 billion through hisec in a BR.
---
The Bowhead (ship mover) is a loot Pinata.  I don't understand why people still use them.
---
A few days ago I somehow managed to watch his stream for a short while without trying to bang my head against a door. The sheer stupidity of this guy is hilarious, entertaining but also aggravating.
---
remember the good old days when supercaps "countered the blob"
---
Oh sorry it was 18 - 24 months ago, which certainly compares to mittanis thing which was literally 7 years ago.

I think its you who needs the history lesson dude.  Heres was GigX said :

If that isn't a RL threat I don't know what is.  "Give me his address IRL".  How could that be construted as "not a RL threat".
---
That was a idea back when PH was made, it quickly was scrapped. It is just got a good idea to throw our best pilots in to a different alliance with different cultures and hope they fit in and make friends. With new sigs and corps in ph, it is just as viable for veteran players as it is for neBeans.
---
That said if you are active in PH it is easier to get a vouch in a pamfam alliance then if you was else where.
---
&gt;I mean fuck, I'm biased. Of course I am. But I do truly believe that if PH stood on it's own, and cut ties with panfam, the game would be in a better place.
---
How does your prescription taste?
---
just wait till people start posting about the Muslim "re-education camps" in china that is going to open another can of worms
---
Activate the module before locking as soon as you lock the module will activate.
---
Thank fuck for the Silent Knights subchannel
---
No problem at all! God speed o7
---
Yeah of course, but that’s normal and I’m on the same lane as you, it’s just when people start getting personal, wishing bad upon people irl, that’s a bit too much imo..
---
Once again, lick my taint.
---
Hes using the goddamn default overview.
---
It's a little trickier with cloaky ships because trying this trick before the lock timer ends will cancel the whole thing, but if you're uncloaked with no weapons/lock timer you can activate the tackle module first and *then* click on the target. It will automatically lock them and activate the second it finishes locking.
---
You can drag and move your disruptor next to your weapons, so you can press f1,234...to activate modules on the first line. You can also hide passive modules. 
---
You can also click modules before locking a target (modules will then flash) and then lock target.  Your preselected modules will active as soon as you get lock. This method can be laggy. I suggest the first option.
---
ok so be they person
---
Do Yous RP ?
---
flair baiting is a thing.

Something something pendulum

This is as personal as it will ever get, There are no Goons!

Well, Init are allied with GSF. Snuffed Out is not, who cares what they do.
---
I still need to get shit out of Deklein
---
Contact Sadus when you are looking for some space to rent.
---
If you are flying a T1 Industrial ship keep the value low if someone sees you worth killing they will also I would avoid public contracts look at a corp like redfrog or pushx keep in mind I'm pretty sure redfrog is freighter only I'm not sure about pushx

Oh, come on, don't point out the hypocrisy! They might call you a bully or a racist...

Stainguy taking raw numbers out of context since forever. Get a grip.
---
Comparing PH to legacy is a bit of a stretch isn't it?
---
Comparing PH to frat+HRE may perhaps also slightly hint at being a stretch... 
---
I truly believe than legacy can stand on it's own. I don't believe PH can. Do you truly believe otherwise???
---
If the home you just bought was 500k and all you had was 500k to your name, we call that house poor. So yes. He's a poor.
---
You have them confused with NC.
---
:)
---
Fyi, most of our kills are in Test systems, that’s even before they get to brave catch systems.. Its just an incentive, it’s a way of saying thank you for defending our homeland. 
---
But what do I know, I’m used to being part of an alliance that gives more to its members than it takes.. I wouldn’t know how it feels to be a slave.
---
We don’t have mandatory fleets, real life comes first, free for all moon mining, 100% Jita buy backs, get paid for doing notable actions, getting paid for boosting edm in certain system, loads of bounties in the hundreds of millions. I could honestly go on.
---
But you guys do you.
---
they drink secret toasts to his health
---
As of me posting this, Sort Dragon has not made a deal with the Imperium to fight alongside of them. It's just Hedliner talking out of his ass again.  He just expelled Slyce from his Coalition, he has other things to worry about.
---
should have asked the 500 hk to help
---
Empires of Eve for the knowledge win. Just read it a couple weeks ago, and now I get some of these references!!!! :D
---
I’m so proud to have taught you that.
---
we did that for almost two weeks last war, and it was fucking cancer. All it did was turn every fight into a contest to see who was willing to form more hours before the timer than the other guy so their caps could load grid and wait for the opposing caps to give up on the idea of jumping into TIDI to fight them. Which resulted in hundreds of people forming up, getting on grid and then sitting there for fucking HOURS while we waited for the ihub timer to end, then sitting there for longer waiting for the toasters to kill the nodes and then going home sometimes without any fight because no one wanted to jump into a TIDI firing squad.
---
Atleast Gigx created content and didn't want to blue everyone.
---
found the dronelands botter. FTFY
---
You can be this dumb in delve and still get saved. Imagine how dumb the ones who die are.
---
Stop protecting botters
---
So, what happened to Sapporo?
---
i mean, test's backyard is no stranger to botting. and now inviting big botting alliance to omist..yeah
---
So all I read is someone mad a spreadsheet about bots, good. And then started something racist, bad.
---
I’m just here for the Stuka fleets, tbh. I make all my isk from exploration and hunting explorers, so buybacks, moon mining, etc don’t effect me, and I’ve never been told “get in fleet or get purged”, so I really don’t have any problems with Init. But as long as we have the best Stuka FCs I don’t think I’ll be leaving for a while
---
dscan has a limited range what you would propose efectively makes anyone out of dscan range a Recon for newbies. Most NS and LS systems are rather large and frigates can take on a capital unless you bunch a whole lot of them. You also make it much harder for people to to use zkillboard to see if someone is likely to be engagable. Your average Alpha can't combat probe on a combat frigate either.
---
I'd just the same not involve any WH. That results in literal months of boohooing.
---
Looks like a big ewar drone nerf in there too.  
---
**ECM Activation time / duration:** 5000.0 **=&gt;** 20000.0

**Jam Duration:** None **=&gt;** 5000.0
---
I watched this live and I just hope that the Goons and the stream chat try and talk to this guy like a person instead of just using him for lols. I can't tell if he's a troll or not, but continuing to feed him bad info on stream and give him negative attention is going to be bad in the long run for him IRL.
---
I could be totally wrong, but if he's honestly using a CC# to buy plex and get isk for these supers, and the community eggs him on through Twitch views, Reddit posts and such, there's a real possibility of him going fucking broke and ruining his life. 
---
I'm all for nonconsensual PVP, but let's at least try to be responsible with giving people a celebrity that may have a negative impact on someone.
---
Imagine someone burning money on stream and everyone's like "go on, do it man!" and they get tens of thousands of views until they are broke. 
---
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe he's a fucking Silicon Valley millionaire and can afford thousands a month on Eve.
---
Anyway, I'm going to continue to say my piece on this dude. I think it's bad mojo to continue to encourage him to fly expensive shit in chat stream when its obvious he doesn't know a lot about the game.
---
7o and be human you assholes
---
Was super fun fight, gf all around!
---
I’ve never used the buybacks either apart from the exploration one since that’s how I make my isk as well. Also nobody is talking about you leaving init either.
---
My post was directed about what you said, that other alliances don’t need to pay their members to kill intruders, making it seem like they wouldn’t do it unless they were getting paid for it, I was just proving that’s not the case.
---
Fair comment.
---
I love flying my kiting rlml+drone+neut legion. So many little preference variations. The lack of a web is made up for by having bonused dual medium neuts. Solid
---
Haha, well played my fellow redditor!
---
The goings on of nullsec are as important and noticeable to me as the activity of the ants outside my home.
---
I'm sure they're doing something but I don't care.
---
I lived that ant life once and it was not particularly fun.
---
CTAs when another colony invades. Hunting potential food sources. Always having to worry about the logistics of the hive. Wondering if I may be captured and eaten by a superior predator.
---
I'd rather do the bee thing and just play it safe. Bouncing from flower to flower, reaping small but consistent rewards and occasionally getting something excellent.
---
Best comment on reddit today, hats off to you.
---
Just stating something obvious because there are people who think some random person online deserves having their connection disconnected because they're Chinese.
---
Cheers!
---
Having been a part of many a sov defense fleet... Forcing groups to do that endlessly, whenever a small gang so much as sneezes in an ihubs direction, would be a living nightmare.
---
It would end up as the current state of asiblex gates: CCP thought to generate content by making them trivial to reinforce, with a &lt;24h timer. The reality, however, is that its essentially just a trolling tactic, with small groups reinforcing out of timezone and then not showing up if the owner puts up any sort of defense for the timer.
---
So rather than generating content, they just make group A grind the thing repeatedly uncontested, while group B burns itself out as they are forced to form up and get blue balled each time.
---
He mentioned in a previous stream he spent ~$20k on eve. Doesn't appear to have any real hobbies outside of the game either. No idea over what time period that number is tho.
---
I was watching him duel box a bit up in cloud ring. He was struggling and mentioned he only had one monitor.
---
I told him to buy less carriers and get a 2nd monitor. I felt bad after cause he didn't say anything for a few seconds after.
---
Still agree let's try and help and motivate him to get better. He clearly loves the game and participates more than most of us posting here.
---
But ... but Test are the oppressed rebels fighting all of Eve!
---
Reee, muh narrative!
---
Yeah but AOM bot in Goonswarm's renter corp so it doesn't count dumbass.
---
&gt; The Bowhead (**ship mover**) is a loot Pinata. I don't understand why people still use them.
---
Don't worry. I started solo PVP'ing in lowsec before I even knew what D-scan was.
---
my biggest so far was 500 plex for 215mil in jita of all places
---
Just a side note, you said the rep gain is slow going for you, make sure your social skills are trained somewhat, and also drink some Impetus Potency-50 or -75, that'll help alot.
---
Couldn't remember
---
the greatest plan in the world
---
Looking to sell? :P
---
he still plays though, most of the core balka guys are in Horde and almost all of Impass co2 is in Panfam
---
you're gay
---
Right on! Sometimes the near misses are such a thrill.😁
---
Resurrection could have gone better if they didn't move to the fucking Imperium borderlands, what did they think would happen? 
---
Also, merging with a almost dead Inpanic (lots of numbers, few in fleet) then merging with a definitely dead MOA was terribly decisions
---
Shiny KS kills yay!
---
stop being a retard
---
Hm... Hy, can we go after GOTG in this?
---
What I was saying is that you don’t need to put bounties on kills to have people go and get kills, especially when it’s on pilots in your space. When I was in PH we had nothing like that but the only thing I would be worried about when I was chasing down enemies from intel would be that one of the other ram jag/ceptor pilots would get them tackled before I could. There’s almost no one dumb enough to roam fountain/querious, but when they do a simple ping for people to hop to standing summons up 30 or so people to send the intruders back via pod express.
---
and Bot have been owned for NC. for how long? Those numbers doesn't give any context untill he releases year by year stats.
---
Tell that to your Russian friends
---
You mean they have a collateral of 20 billion? Because compensation is what you get paid for doing something.
---

Naw, not enough naked chicks to be GOT... also, your average capsuleer understands "air superiority" much better than GOT.

8 is very few, considering there's roughly 35000 players in delve.
---
you can't make this shit up, you really can't

Got to take 'em out of their pants to be effective.
---
&gt;dscan has a limited range
---
just warp around lmao you're clueless
---
&gt;Most NS and LS systems are rather large and frigates can take on a capital unless you bunch a whole lot of them.
---
there is more to kill than capitals
---
&gt;Your average Alpha can't combat probe on a combat frigate either.
---
what are warpable anomalies
---
Well, it seem HC felt like calling in several allied from Nul to handle EM and friends.
---
1200 member coalition VS &lt;300 member Alliance
---
I'm thinking this is going to either bring big fights, or its going to turn into absolutely nothing. Bets are being taken.
---
Sapporo is still the executor of our hearts, but he doesn't really do Mil stuff. He just frags cynos, drives Suburus, and looks hansom while doing it.
---
You go to the front of the class and consider yourself a lap behind?
---
Probably him, seeing as the guys who dropped him could've killed him with 5 dreads
---
Goons declares war and will only withdraw when you've accepted Evan McClean into your alliance.
---
Not everyone wants to have complete safety in this game at the expense of pvp. Hence why the north doesn't have a coalition.
---
'Some of us want to be losers'.

i really feel the eve ui particularly lends itself to all sorts of meming around

#INB4 SORT HAS A LAW DEGREE 
---
Invincible V (trained)
---
well as frustrating as it is to see big groups getting even bigger at least they're handling this as real allies and not pretending to be neutral.
---
Too many kneelers in here I'm sure. Even Bobby B would agree with you there.
---
Ok now I understand what you mean, for people like yourself it might not make a big difference it seems.. However Brave might not be on the same level as you guys, PH, Goons or test for example, most of the day to day active players are either newbros like myself and or returning players, these things make a big difference for us as we can make money while pvping and just have fun with little to no grind...
---
&gt;why not try and make it you
---
Trying is fine. Achieving it is boring as fuck. I'd rather loose 100 battles in a close fight than win 1000 where I just dicked everyone down.
---
&gt;Takes two to tango
---
And right now goons and TEST are one and a half. If TAPI wouldn't make up more than half of null players by themselves it would a lot more fun for everyone involved. But sure, keep turbocrabbing in this shit meta. And then, when you finally did it, when you finally captured everything, you can at least tell yourself that it wasn't your turbocrabbing that killed the game, it was the others not doing it.
---
WOOT!! MORE FIGHTS TO THIRD=PARTY ON!!
---
I have 8 large skill injectors. I have never used one before. Also, I am still new to the game (4 months in total). I am Caldari and I like Exploration (Stratios I use very much for it) plus PvE (Ratting, Abyssel, but not missions). I generally like PvP also, but wouldn't go that road just yet.
---
After doing missions, I got bored with them. But Exploration I find really fun. So, my plan is to invest or specialize in drones, armor and scanning. After that, I would slow-boat the missile skills for t2 launchers while having Stratios as a good "toy" for exploring the New Eden and having fun.
---
My question is, do you think this plan is good? Is it wise to invest in these three groups. I figure a large number of ships use drones, armor tanking is also popular. Scanning I would only go for lvl4 as a max. Or, what would you do different? Could going to lvl5 be a mistake at this early time in my career?
---
PGL would need to FC both fleets and yell at both in Chinese and English. That would be entertaining.
---
?
---
Eh, maybe recently, but old wars used to last a long time.
---
how many more times was he going to click on something and not read the fucking pop up explaining he was out of range?
---
God speed Evan &lt;3
---
I think he may have just outed himself as one of those politicians...
---
I do!
---
They'd have actually killed him if it weren't for the bumps.
---
Hey genius, it's big (if true) not true (if big).
---
I'm not sure if your understanding of data is consistent with the general notion of what data is.
---
I've been on a few hundred Goon fleets and not noticed any "toxicity".  There's sometimes sperg but that's not the same thing - and we nave No Chatter for when it becomes intolerable (which isn't frequent).
---
70% of null takes on the 16%. Serenity isn't coming, it's already here.  
---
Would like to thank top Dawgs at BoB, Goons, NCPL for the big gud fights and going for the top.  
---
TY Horde and Brave for enabling Eve for so many new players.  
---
Ty Sort for being the biggest turd in the game, it's a hard role to fill , someone's gotta do it, you stepped up reoeatedly and you've done it well.  
---
Xix/Fraternity, thanks for enabling it for non English speakers. Also, hurr durr bots.
---
Wormholers too because wormholers btw.
---
Ty SMA/Solar/TEST/CVA etc  for being the extras in this grand cast of Tranquility. 
---
Finally, I'd like to thank /r/Eve for making it all immeasurbaly more fun and interesting. 
---
Now, time to look forward to hopefully gud fites. O/
---
Reminds me of when I was in High School and I asked a Chinese exchange student about the Tienanmen Square Incident. Her response, "Oh ya that was just a big misunderstanding that is used as propaganda against the Chinese". I digress..
---
Sort sounds like a power tripping faggot who has no issue spreading the buttcheeks apart of members of his Alliance to make way for the new Chinese renters. After all, without immigrants how would he continue to improve his growth and line his pockets? God forbid someone loyal to the alliance speaks up about it lest they get kicked out. Enjoy your combat sites and belts being taken while your prices skyrocket because your leader wants to make his pockets fatter at the expense of those under him. Politicians, all the fucking same.
---
what is formatting?
---
gay
---
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
He god a dread spawn
---
probotlegend has spoken
---
i hope Test blues so many people that Goons see them as a threat and declare war against Legacy
---
I'm not so sure that welcoming people who are homeless because they intentionally burned their house down into our house is a good idea.
---
Of course they Will Blue them. Was actually hoping something actually stood up against the South as An independent player in Eve. But no of course not so now they bot under test control   goodbye Eve economy
---
Only that didn't happen in this case, the character name was not linked in local or emailed to them it was on the internal form that was being created to be sent to CCP. It didn't go public until sort decided to have his little meltdown over botting income being threatened.
---
Yea let's Blue everyone in Eve. No more big nullsec wars only filling wallets and buying ships People Will never undock. Way to go test. Way to go.
---
Can someone please tell him about the F keys
---
Goons already survived all of Eve after them in the Casino war/WWB. So that  was already done. Eve had to go so far as unify into one group backed with RMT kingpins to get it done.
---
Can everyone just unblue everyone because this game is getting really dull.
---
&gt;collateral
---
Yes, edited.
---
Awww Omist, still will be my forever home. Lived there with Xetic back in the day. Fond memories of the place :)
---
Well no more content because test wants to Blue entire Eve. So no more nullsec wars. Only filling wallets and buying ships no one is ever going to undock.   I was hoping something would stand up against the South but that hope is all gone. Now the chinese can bot under test protection and we have to suffer because of test.  Way to go guys
---
HELL YEAH! WELCOME TO TRANQUILITY!
---
there's obviously something wrong with the dude.
---
Not possible because just imagine that they take a risc and lost a little bit on their trillion isk.   We are gonna have to suffer because of them
---
I have already ordered new pc and upgraded my stream setup specificaly for you. Yellow shits.
---
Going to be confusing having Serenity PBIC and the wormholer rental alliance PBIC going forward.  Especially since we’ll constantly be hearing about how PBIC is full of bots.
---
The ship is still called a stealth bomber, idiot.
---
While I have given crap to GoTG for being a soulless weak construct in the past, I do see that Sort is very smart on self survival. I personally don't blame him if he wants to act on Panfam with a grudge. Panfam will never view its allies with any good opinion (even PH for that matter) unless they can use you. Otherwise you are fodder to their whims.
---
Personally, I'd spend the SP on "boring" core skills that don't do much exciting but apply to every single ship in some way. 
---
Stuff like capacitor, navigation, armour and shield skills are good. Drones too, as they're carried by a lot of ships, the majority of cruisers and up. If you can get into a decently skilled gila it'll improve your abyssal completion times. 
---
For exploration, you may find that an astero is a better investment, just because it's faster to get around, as well as being much harder to catch.
---
The salt in this thread is sooo tasty.
---
The PIBC from Serinity will go by a different name on TQ.
---
Asking for his real details isn't a threat, it wasn't even said in the same line. It isn't even doxxing as he didn't give it :|
---
2 years is a fair amount of time. And people keep bringing up that it was long ago like that excuses it. It was a shitty thing to do then, it's still a shitty thing. His lack of remorse for his actions is even worse. He hasn't changed, why would the passage of time matter?
---
Counter-idea: what if, instead of index tightening the window for RF, it lengthened the time to reinforce? That would make cross-timezone conflict more approachable.
---
Just spitballing.  Everyone complains, but I’ve never seen this idea brought up before (though its possible I just missed it)
---
Nice deflection attempt lmao
---
 Flawless if factual
---
Test and Imperium helped each other quite a bit last year.  Namely during UALX and X-47 battles we moved supercaps across the map to support each other but we both had a presence in smaller skirmishes throughout both regions when needed.  We were set blue to each other at the time too.
---
Going to be a long war
---
Oh yeah, no I know about that, I'm just saying it would be funny if TEST helped goons attack the north, considering TEST's role during WWB
---
New alliance appears
---
TAPI immediately blues them
---
Shocking
---
Well test has once again contributed to the death of Eve.        Soon there Will be no content because goons and test are afraid of losing a bit of isk. 
---
No wonder why the player numbers are dropping
---
does this mean we have to start giving you guys SRP?
---
Tbh if you look at it from their perspective, if Test didn’t  get them on board, NC could of, pamfam could of, goons could of.. Because everyone in this fucking game is trying to be the biggest baddest group, as if nobody likes content.
---
I really really hope, CCP has actually thought of Triglavian incursions well enough so that they can actually do something good for the game, for example split the whole of nullsec, leaving certain areas prone to attacks and so on, if you know what I mean.. At this rate, in the next 2-3 years I can only imagine “friendly” pre arranged fleet battles and 0 wars, in other words whole of Eve would be blue.
---
Someone is bitter
---
base all your campaign against frat smearing them about being full of botters, proceed to invite the biggest botters eve online has ever known to your couch,  sasuga piggles
---
Exactly  that is going to be the Future pre aranged things i was hoping aom would be a new entity in the north or something that would go fight South  and i was hoping for content again. Big Wars. But nope all is lost all because they goons and test are afraid to lose a little isk.
---
Inb4 the whole of Eve is blue and there’s only artificial battles and “wars”, the future content of eve will be 2 alliances place a structure and the enemy “team” that destroys the opposing structure will win the “war” lol
---
You realize PH is the one major alliance with even lower recruitment standards than Brave, right?
---
What cultural revolution?
---
That picture is a lie.  They are indeed deniers. Let's Blue everyone so we can fill our wallets buy ships we Will never undock and help to kill Eve as soon as we can
---
Were you expecting anything different from Test?
---
Titan blobs were cool 3 years ago. I don't mind sitting this one out.
---
&gt; Trying is fine. Achieving it is boring as fuck.
---
TIL winning is boring 
---
&gt; than win 1000 where I just dicked everyone down.
---
I'm beginning to feel you're either new to the game or just haven't been paying attention all these years.
---
&gt; And right now goons and TEST are one and a half.
---
And you realise thats the norths fault right?
---
&gt; If TAPI wouldn't make up more than half of null players by themselves it would a lot more fun for everyone involved.
---
It surely would and goes back to a point I've already stated,
---
&gt;You lot lower down the totem pole up north need to get your acts together and start offering up some resistance instead of slowly decaying on the vine with a has been HC then.
---
Goons and TAPI are not the reason you can't attract anyone of any worth and are instead bleeding corps at a steady rate.
---
&gt; But sure, keep turbocrabbing in this shit meta. 
---
It was so much better for the north when they could turbo krab moons with no effort wasn't it, good times. Why is it goons fault for adapting to the meta, however shit it is. Did everyone north of the wall just forget adapt or die after espousing it for so long?
---
&gt;And then, when you finally did it, when you finally captured everything, you can at least tell yourself that it wasn't your turbocrabbing that killed the game, it was the others not doing it.
---
No the blame would be on CCP for that one for not changing the meta, goons would get the winners trophy and you the also ran.
---
Be Better, I know some of you have it in you.
---
Doesn’t mean we aren’t recruiting!
---
50/50 to be honest. But i would have hoped for changes in nullsec sov. But those Will never come after this
---
I’ve heard they accept pretty much anyone and that there’s been a lot of awoxing in the past, apart from that I don’t really know much about them..
---
waaaaaah! Dey hab moor frenz den me. Bad TEST, bad!
---
Nice idea but if war broke our Test would just surrender and become a goon sig. 
---
Or, more of a goon sig.
---
wtf I like Sort now?
---
Awoxing isn’t really a big problem, although for carrier ratters or JF pilots it’s probably a bit more of an issue, I’ve seen both of those die to blue bubbles. 
---
Mostly they’re just pretty similar to Brave, from what I’ve heard, but with worse SRP, more people, and more stuff to do
---
&gt;This excuse is getting tired. You know you can shoot NC/PL without being blue to everyone who isn't NC/PL right?
---
You know you can shoot goons/test without blueing everyone who isn't goons/test right?
---
Funny you say that, I was in goons for a while and I thought, damn I don’t wanna be a part of the big blob... Found out about Brave and I liked what they stand for, thought oh they’re kinda big but not THAT big, little did I know they were in a coalition with thousands of other people, then I came to the realization that everyone is fucking blue in this game.
---
Yes they are bluetrals to everyone, but I agree it's also part of the system.  You get evicted enough times, and eventually you blue up half the map so you have no chance to get evicted again.  
---
Content denied?  Yes
---
Smart way to build up? Yes 
---
Bad for eve?  Yes
---
Why?
---
or if you are bored like me use a bricktank maller to pull missionrats clser to beacon in their missins so when they warp in they get instapointed which is in 3/5 cases enough time to land inside and get point myself
---
Which alliance will lose some Supercaps to a fleet hiding behind a big rock though?
---
Can Assault Frigates go in FW novice plexes?
---
...that is what i currently do, lol.
---
&gt; in the next 2-3 years I can only imagine “friendly” pre arranged fleet battles and 0 wars
---
There's another war about to kick off as you post that.
---
Hey guys, look! Look at this! I found some random line member nobody has ever heard of saying something edgy!
---
YES GO GO GO BURN THEM ALL
---
can't you like, offline it? why take it off?
---
600 titans
---
Better writing
---
I was speaking about what I thought the future would be at this rate. 
---
But I think I saw the post about goons going at war with somebody, which I’m excited for as Test is currently at a war, goons will be at a war, and hopefully the rest of Eve jumps in on the train and I actually have a bit of hope that this is gonna have somewhat an impact on how things are at the moment..
---
We're going to reclaim the TESTAGRAM
---
And then got backstabbed by horde
---
More like Brazen Bull'ed
---
Fuck off will you.  There's a good girl.
---
I too go out of my way to defend my alliance on every reddit post for the past hour
---
We get to plug a timezone hole *and* trigger r/eve at the same time. Pretty clear cut win/win in my book.
---
If you want to believe INIT isn't a part of the single largest coalition in the game because they like to stand on their own, fair enough.
---
Disappointing but not unexpected to see PIBC trying to create the blue megabloc from Serenity by cozying up to the biggest piece of the donut already on TQ.
---
I hope the TQ alliances that are getting into bed with them are going to be vigilant and firm regarding botting, at least.
---
Yup, problem is that's human nature (even if it is boring af) and I can't really think of a game mechanic way in a sandbox to incentivize large groups to split up.  Making it so that a single region couldn't support as many people would certainly be a start though.
---
What’s wrong with the default overview
---
ngl I'm real happy to see TEST returning to its roots and posting propaganda
---
Nope. T2 ships are always the next tier up, to AF's are limited to Smalls.
---
&gt;you mean why can't init and snuff 2 relatively mid sized alliance
---
&gt;init
---
&gt;mid sized
---
init + IM has literally the 4th highest player count in the entire game, losing only to goons, test and PH, the one who accepts any application with literally zero background check. 
---
what is wrong with you people
---
I enjoy being a part of the good guys.
---
Or no one bothered to explain the game to him
---
More like Haargoth's sentient melanoma.
---
Sick this is best posting praxis tbqh
---
&gt; that it is like Germans they get upset about Holocaust memorials
---
https://www.visitberlin.de/en/memorial-murdered-jews-europe hm?
---
Tried that, got raped, repeatedly.
---
You have not been paying attention. Wake up at the back!
---
*CCP Peligro nervously shifts in his seat*
---
Wow, stratios prices have crashed past the gila. Does anyone have any advice on drone selection in that monster 400m3 bay while I cry about how useless the ishtar is? Also, is it worth going for T2 lasers in soloing low classes of wormhole space, or should I just suck it up and go for a capless fit? I'm thinking of getting a T3C after I get the hang of the strat.
---
That sounds like a bucket of fun. Harbis with guard support, 20 man battleship fleets, T1 dessies picking off stray logi, good time. Yall EU or US?
---
There is no meat where goons are going, only vegans and soy.
---
There aren't any timezone holes if nobody is going to fight you anyways.
---
:thinking:
---
as usual a high quality, low effort video. Would rate it a solid 5/7, watched it twice
---
Yeah, I'm bored, and shitposting is how I kill the time :-)
---
Grab a frigate, login and jump into it for free
---
You have been banned from Chinese Communist Party (/r/CCP)
---
Nan desu ka?
---
There's more to it than that. Does he have gaps in his knowledge? Sure, so does everyone. But the amount of cash he's consistently throwing at the game for years now? The way he talks? He has issues.
---
You could just leave TEST, given that they're the biggest bluers in the game.
---
Everyone dog piled against goons yet no one claimed ITS LIKE SERENITY then
---
It's uncanny how closely the Goons resemble phages.
---
We find him lacking.
---
bring someone else in to burn your house down for insurance money
---
i hope you like meaningless tidi structure bashes, cause that's all ya gonna get lmao. 
---
also rip tri, those guys can't catch a break
---
Wormholes exist.
---
Lol karma is funny right?
---
Yeah, I doubt we're going to have any trouble finding people to shoot. Or people who want to shoot us.
---
I'unno, TEST salt is still best salt.
---
&gt;I hope the TQ alliances that are getting into bed with them are going to be vigilant and firm regarding botting, at least.
---
I have a lowsec gate to Stain to sell you if you believe that.
---
What do you mean by 1 billion pod?
---
Tbh Ian was sloppy, it's the other side, not Imperial Legacy, that says "dock up faction titans", "deagress".
---
People in a Reddit based corp being active on Reddit.
---
You might be on to something.
---
I'm sure you have plenty of the latter now, at least.
---
What an insanely boring time they'll have starting their lives on TQ in the ass-end of the universe. Hopefully they get at least a sprinkle of content out of Frat, cuz there isn't much else nearby.
---
Not played in months, probably part of the reason.
---
A time of hatred, fear and carnage. Humankind, divided and scattered over the universe
---
Who could unite us once again in this grim dark future?
---
welcome back (✿◠‿◠)
---
Someone who doxxes, and it's not the first time he's been flirting with that at least, really shouldn't be on the CSM.
---
Honestly, if you're running sites in a C3 just buy a rattlesnake. It'll run the sites faster and cheaper.
---
The new residents will pay some very good money, so burning down the house doesn't seem that bad
---
Remember when PGL told everyone on Legacy that it was them vs. all of Eve again? lol
---
Test isn't really a reddit based alliance anymore, dreddit is no longer the majority of test, and I'm pretty sure if you asked in alliance chat the meaning of your alliances name most would be clueless.
---
Reddit based test is gone, it's just another big alliance.
---
make the mechanics zero sum. If 1000 members of test get the isk from the space then it means the other 1000 cant. at the moment the game isnt zero sum. Everyone just gets everything, with no scarcity ever becoming involved
---
Yeah, but that assumes he buys the house.  If someone just has 200k sitting around that doesn't make them poor.
---
