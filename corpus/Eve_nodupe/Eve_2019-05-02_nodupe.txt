It will do absolutely nothing to combat botting. There are 4 major groups of bots
---

---
1. Ratting Bots
---
2. Mining Bots
---
3. Salvaging bots
---
4. Market Trading Bots ($0.01'ers)
---
The third are used extensively by the major botting alliances.
---
by 2 snakes u mean pvp fit or pve fit?
---
Well, I mean, at least supers and titans can't jump through them like normal gates, I guess.
---
He's taking lessons from PGL. I'm pretty sure half the dicks in EvE must smell like hot wings at this point.
---
engaging an enemy without an initial advantage and outnumbered initially? yes? ok
---
ign?
---
We spend our lives trying to waste time until we run out of it. If you're not happy with how you're wasting yours, stop worrying about what others are doing and make the change, good luck.

If you're gonna talk about the Widow, we may as well bring up the fact that the whole blops line is just irredeemable (see what I did there) garbage. Why bring blops when you can bring lokis and bombers?

"Lead" GoTG FC agreeing to a comment that says some of his allies don't matter. Brilliant.

they took the plexpill and are ready to shill so that they don't feel like they wasted years of their life on a game

Can I have your stuff
---
I feel personally attacked
---
they need to take the boomer pill and day of the pillow disgruntled veteran players when they agree to "ya you can totes use my toonies bro"
---
I'm having fun again, I hadn't for a long time and took a long break. I very recently returned, staying away from the clown massive alliances and having GREAT fun.
---
Jebaited, your honor
---
I agree. Being in Init we are blue to very few alliances, unlike NC and the rest of Panfam.
---
Sure we are blue to more people, but that doesn't matter.
---
I'll be fair, you guys got invaded by some of the guys hitting this Fort, why the hell would you help them.

Noticed this a while ago but thought it was relevant. This isnt just a bug where the effects dont show up - colors are distinctly different, usually red instead of whatever they're supposed to be. CCP planning to deactivate gates? A fuckup somewhere in the system?

Is ISS Marginis coming back, too?

Null is the same, but "police" are slower to respond and charge you more in taxes.
---
Wormholes are the way to go.
---
Not gonna lie. Living in wormholes I still do this when lazy.
---
also, for some coincidental totally not related reason a fuckin incursion pops in const outta no where.
---
can i have an amazon reflink for that?
---
This might come as a surprise, but not everyone and everything on the internet is supposed to serve you. If you still feel it  does, I strongly urge you to find a professional help.
---
You forgot about POS' which is what most use.
---
Give the jackdaw a bonus to medium autocannons.
---
Never really thought about messing around in wormholes before but thanks for the idea
---
You're so cute.
---
Taking that tingling sensation to the next level.
---
Do it!!!
---
no.
---
two, maybe three guards warped out, i believe it was six guards in total.
---
the same thing but better
---
There's trade offs on both sides, such as the need to build, place, fuel and defend them, as opposed to a permanent piece of infrastructure that anyone can use an unlimited number of times, with any size ship, that is also invulnerable. Feature parity with the old stuff is something they constantly strive for, and now that I think about it, I can't remember what could prevent a jump through a jump bridge.
---
I very well might hisec just feels too safe, I like having an actual risk of losing stuff to not paying attention to keep me engaged before I feel burnt out
---
Heh. KDF-GY, wasn't it? 
---
Be interesting to see how this works out.
---
"Sorry, my friend grabbed my phone and sent that."
---
YOU ARE A GOON!!!
---
I can guarantee you id be attemping to kill people as mining and industry is just feeling like a grind/number crunching and is just dull feeling to me if its all I do
---
The main trade hubs are Jita, Amarr, Rens, Hek, and Dodixie. Rens is like 2-3 jumps from Minmatar fw space (Amamake) so it's very conveniently placed in my experience. Certain stations around more popular parts of fw space can be pretty well stocked, although it will be hit or miss, so you'll learn quickly how to improvise effective fits with what modules and ships are present.
---
Pvp corps in ls space will sometimes have common ships+fits at stations in ls as well, either on the market or under contracts. I've also found that if you put up good fights and generally come across over local/in combat as a decent person and aspiring pvp-er, those groups may well offer to stock a few of your favorite fits in that region for 15% above production cost/Jita cost/what-have-you. If you manage that, being able to forge connections with people you blow up/who blow up you is a very valuable skill in its own right, in addition to the obvious benefit of reducing how long it takes to reship.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You could haul a bunch of your ships to ls in a freighter if you have the character and player skills to survive the trip, or If you have the isk, contracting a transport service to haul a bunch of your ships to a lowsec station is also a solid option.
---
If a citadel has reprocessing, then it also has compression. Due to quirks, compression can't charge, but if you're feeling "nice", then you can tip the owner corp of the citadel some isk.
---
Well.... I mean, we can, the game just doesn't adjust the route for ua much from fastest
---
I always wanted to come back to Delve for old times sake....
---
Mining in high sec is kinda boring, but if that is *your thing*, then go for it.
---

all of a sudden this is a wholesome post (◡‿◡✿)
---
looks like jita local minus the scam contracts
---
Well wormholes are awesome for danger and being dangerous. One place to maybe look beforehand is to do some 1vs1 frigate fighting in low sec. there are plenty of people out there in T1 frigates looking for 1on1 fights. I live in a wormhole but if we get a good connection I have a pile of Tristan’s sitting on the border of lowsec to just keep looking for one on one fights all afternoon. 
---
This is a way you can practice pvp with a cheaper ship than would be good in wormholes. But if you join a wormhole Corp that’s a great way to go too. Just solo low level wormhole PvP life is hard.
---
Please travel in a pod its safe i promise :)
---
Hopefully you are not completely done, EvE is a unique and wonderful place in my opinion.
---
To me it seems you are burnt out with your current situation and struggling to find a work/play balance. I've struggled with both but finding a middle ground has left me far more fulfilled.
---
Maybe leave yourself one account, just in case. If not, well I admire your commitment.
---
^(can i have your stuff pls)
---
I would defianlty be looking for a corp if i was to stay there. Ive noticed the solo life is not the way for this game.
---
But then how will I know if a neut enters the same region and dock up my 300 rorquals?
---
Twitch chat is really just trying to keep up with Eve Local Chat meta.
---
Dude .......I haven't given CCP money since 2017 😑
---
Because hybrids do thermal and kinetic damage. Hornets and hobgoblins do more damage on paper, but 1) having drones that do a different damage type than your weapons helps minimize the effectiveness of a reactive armor hardener and the like and 2) taking advantage of a ship's resist profile with slightly less pure dps is typically more effective than simply using more damaging drones that are shooting right into a higher resistance.
---
Also, acolytes are almost as fast as warriors and have high tracking with slightly more dps, so they're very useful for staying with and projecting damage against very fast frigates.
---
You should donate your body to science because im super curious what you have in place of a working brain

well i could see the empires  closeing some  ways in  specific  to temporary funnel the traffic in other directions.  
---
For exemple  shut  incursions system out  so it can only be  entered thro one system and  stop the spreading of sansha forces, or close gates for enemy forces in fw if the system is taken  and the enemy have to take  the other side to reopen it.

I won't say they don't exist, but the alliance which they fly under has no bearing on how many bots their are. I've been apart of almost every coalition in the game. They all have bots and they all pretty much do jack to prevent them. No major alliance (1000+) is free of fault, and no single alliance/coalition is to blame.
---
As long as the triglavians are players I'm ok with this. Trying to renew Eve with PVE content won't do shit.
---
Why do your fucking alliance mates - that you’re supposed to be leading - have to find out through reddit? You can’t come fucking tell the people that put in hundreds of hours of fleet hours to bash shitty structures, and many hours supporting these operations from behind the screen, that something is changed? It’s been 24 hours and there hasn’t been a single fucking word inwards from our leadership. Not a ping, not a high-command news post, fucking nothing.

As soon as I started treating HS as a trade hub in any other videogame, EVE got so much more fun.

Wormholes are the way to go, you'll get your teeth kicked in quite a few times, but that's all part of the fun, you know?
---
They will be our Eve Martyrs
---

---
Thanks, I will definitely check it out.
---
You won't get banned from eve, but your Corp can ban you.
---
He means armor fit, duh.
---
Now that is a solid translation.
---
Do it man, you won't regret it.
---
and we're all hoping for an invasion event bigger than anything before.
---
what are you waiting for? the longer you wait, the harder it gets
---
Stuka fleet
---
And we had just started talking again on voice comms after a multi-year hiatus caused by Armois Degato's banshee like voice. We left but we took the scourge of Australians off Goonswarm's hands, we effectively killed ANZAC squad by taking all its active members. So I think it was definitely a benefit for Goonswarm all-in-all.
---
the optimistic theorist in me takes this as further proof that the trigs are going to launch a full scale invasion of new eden with massive impact on gameplay.
---
the realist breathes a little harder through his nose and looks at the next shitpost
---
A bunch of students in china protested against the tyranical government, so the government went in and killed a lot of them. It has since been covered up by the chinese government and labeled a hoax.
---
Sounds bad, but the recently formed middle class in China hasn’t really developed cultural etiquette yet. The “great leap forward” destroyed much of the traditional Confucius inspired values of previous ages.
---
Eventually the bot owner will add you to their blue list, then you can just kill them.
---
We have Taiwanese
---
Lets not forget the 25 ish dudes still left in their staging system they just logged in :)  
---
but thats the name of the game! had a good fight and walk away happy, their asshat lives to give a fight another day!
---
&gt;Any chance of success?
---
Sure. You might have to be picky about which fights you take, but there's kills out there.
---
&gt;Is it fun?
---
Up to you. Probably, PvP is a very popular activity.
---
&gt;Is it worth the time training the skills?
---
If you find it fun. Absolutely.
---
what happened to your hauling man? did you graduate?!?!!? cause im pretty sure im one of a lot of people who owe you plex for that

We have a Taiwanese member, he can translate Chinese to us.

Nothing wrong here

I’ll leave a light on for you for when you change your mind. I’ll even be your safe deposit box if there’s anything you want to hold on to, just in case
---
r u ok
---
Agree.  In my observation and understanding, China, not only the government or the country as a whole but also every single person, is seeking its spiritual and cultural core to redifine who we are.  For example, several trends rose recent years, Confucius, Buddhism, Christianism, traditional clothing and architecture, western ways of living. 
---
No matter what it is, it is attempt of seeking. 
---
Seek and ye shall find.
---
So each rorq takes like 100 hours to pay for itself? (I assume 80 mil is a safe average rate when you take moons into account)
---
Hisec players need to venture out on beyond the realm of CONCORD and experience the real meatiness of the game. Seriously though I think the problem is that it’s become a self-reinforcing cycle of “dont go there you’ll die” in hisec corps. When I joined my first hisec corp and asked what nullsec was they simply said “Dont go there cuz you’ll die mercilessly as soon as you enter.” I asked why and they just said “It’s full of hardcore pvpers and no-life hunters whose only joy is killing other capsuleers.” Took me a lot of courage to venture out into nullsec in a cheap frigate (about 1 million ISK) and then realize everything they said about nullsec was either bullshit or wildly exaggerated.
---
Fit 10 Tristans, after they are all blown up you will have a general idea

If you like what you've experienced, fit another 50

Also don't forget to send your stuff to me

Hauling is very time consuming and doesn't pay very well, so trying to plex is a joke.
---
I got my GED, so technically I graduated.
---
I hope CCP reads your comment.  This is a great idea.  I wouldn't mind it being a Data site either just to make Data Analyzers worth fitting.
---
When I opened it there wasn’t one, I was disappointed so I had to do what needed to be done
---
Assuming you have all cruiser lvl5 and t2 cruiser weapons
---
Fit a t2 RLML caracal or gila w/h shield extenders and get to town
---
The tristan is my solo ship of choice, since the alpha changes were you can use some T2 stuff it's pretty dang good.  Roam FW space and focus on the novice plexes.
---
You don't know much about china do you?
---
What do you kill with them?
---
Any chance of more time spent zoomed out and less looking at the ships exploding? It was very hard to determine what was actually going on in that fight where distance and speed mattered so much,
---
Fake TEST member is fake
---
As a brawler frigate pvp pilot, I always consider tristans as one of the scarier ships to see on dscan because you never know how they’re fit.  Those 5 light drones will rip a frigate apart quickly, and if it’s neut fit there goes my tank and tackle, so it can disengage if necessary.
---
I don’t fly kitey stuff well at all, so maybe those ships don’t need to fear the Tristan as much.... but anything that needs to get close has to commit before knowing what they’re going to fight, other than the guarantee of all those drones.
---
There's a no stupid questions thread for questions like this. Try there.
---
I used https://github.com/antihax/goesi which is pretty straight forward. To be honest their swagger documentation is probably a better place to start: https://esi.evetech.net/latest/ . Best of luck.
---
Wow, those have way worse AI than most of the bots in TAPI space. FRT should definitely reach out to some of the TAPI corp leadership to find better software.
---
remove local
---
Delete Local, Delete Citadels, Delete Asset Safety, Delete Injectors, Delete Rorquals
---
Find a corp that seems like you might fit in and try it out. You can always move around as you wish. I found out that once I went to nullsec from months in hisec, Eve seemed like a **completely different game**.
---
Big brain 420 iq gamer moment
---
CCP has the ability to control that number, you know.
---
No ship that is HIC pointed should be able to take them
---
I could link you the BRs that show how snuffy aborted like 4 forts of ours when we first moved in, with init showing up to every one, and us batphoning only on like the 4th try and beyond. But that would lead to the dangerous realm of facts.
---
wow okay we don't want to fully fix the game in one patch
---
I started playing EVE over 15 years ago in early [2004](https://i.imgur.com/7vUzlJ1.png). I played nearly break-free until 2011 -- I didn't care for the direction of the game Incarna represented and my real life was getting too busy. So, it felt like a great idea to [biomass](https://i.imgur.com/Fu7xSX3.jpg) my entire 7 year existence and focus on life.
---
It was a great idea. I went EVE free for about 7 years -- matching my previous play time.
---
About a year ago I found myself with a ton of free time and looking to get back into an MMO and reconnect with some old friends. I found that CCP had introduced a F2P option and catch-up mechanics. I was sold and the rest is history.
---
I guess what I'm saying is that you need to do what you need to do, but projecting your issues on to others is pointless.
---
Right?? I mean everyone in Frat must be a bot :/
---
if your one of them, the post is up. Took my entire day, sorry it wasn't done earlier.
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*

It’s not making fun of the Chinese which is the issue, it’s trying to get them in trouble or even disconnected over spewing Tianman square references. Sorry for thinking Eve should be a “safe space” from people trying to cause real life issues for other players.
---
Yeah it’s unlikely people will be arrested over it but the intent is still there, at least to make them DC. However it is a possibility and my point is that regardless it’s a shitty and cancerous thing to do.

Nah, test is using discord but I used to be in Brave for a long time and slack is what they use for internal stuff. So much better notifications...I have discord on PC and Android phone and sometimes I see pings on the phone, sometimes on PC, sometimes neither. Also, clicking on a notification in discord should take you to that message not to a message from a different channel on a different server from two days ago. It's awful.

Well you did say you’re gonna leave in your post. Kinda late now

---
Well the d scan doesent pull names it just matches signal returns with ang local broad csst from ships to the return like a radar tag. Since d scan has a limited range it has to be a wave pulse as the return would get to weak past a point.
---
Your still sending out coms broadcast passivly its just got a local coms center to reseave it. And has to be net worked through local ships / structures  active at the time.
---
If you must join the squids, join these dudes. Especially if you're USTZ.  GalMil needs more targets!
---
D-scan has no real-world analogue.
---
The problem with your assumption is that the dscan has an adjustable range. Which means there's some way for dscan to know the distance a signal is from your ship.
---
Which means there's no reason why it wouldn't be an automatic function of dscan to always show the distance.
---
Since this isn't the case, we have to conclude that d-scan "somehow" can tell if the distance of a signal is within a certain range via an internal setting, but it cannot tell what that range is. Which isn't something that exists.
---
Is the overview in the bottom left too small to be able to gauge this?
---
Over the last few months PanFam have been shit talking Init, "Init's deployment has failed, lol!"  
---
Init continues to take fleets out and fights under the super umbrella.

Panfam decide to come to the area near Init's backyard, Init and co form all the things.  
---
Panfam: "Nah uhhhhh" \*scurries back to Tribute and posts on Reddit.
---
It has to be *space magic* because a simple wave would take almost four hours to get to 14.3AU and back.
---
Oh hey that’s me
---
Haha. I just received a Remind Me bot message of your comment a year ago that you had like 5 or so stories ready for the NDA expiration.
---
&gt; wave form bouncing off a target an returning
---
It's instantaneous out to ~14AU. The handwavium tech has nothing to do with anything bouncing off and returning.
---
OSRS and Eve players unite!
---
&gt; reflection of light or some other particle
---
I replied similar to another comment. Dscan is instantaneous out to ~14AU. The handwavium tech invovled has nothing to do with light or any other particle reflecting or bouncing off of anything.
---

Eye of terror mk 3
---
it can only estimate that range though it would just be using the strength off the return to say how far out that object is.
---
you don't get the proper distance off a target unless on grid or its a massive target that is broadcasting it distance in some way (stations)
---
yeah i know that, but this is a game ant no body got time for that.
---
Same.
---
\#ReleaseTheJesterReport
---
CODE wants to know your location.
---
my guess that that range is it is ever some how getting  a return or its a signal form the source it self.
---
but as you said its instantaneous but it real life it would be out off date and hours off wait time for returns the game just speeds it up.
---
unless its some kinda i dont know sub space wave that propagates faster then light
---
Me too! Haven't even played Eve in a while but I'm here and ready to read

I was trying out my impression of the north doing their intentional idiot virtue signaling. It seems pretty spot on from the down votes.

never said they were all botters. just said i was in FRT space and managed to catch people who werent real players, but instead botters. the following clips after the vni's in the beginning were real players lmao.
---
At least someone in this thread picked up on that😉
---
Lmao no one know who you are though so how is this possible?
---
are you sure? seems like you might have had a stroke
---
Significantly so, and having drones and pods and crap cluttering up the arena doesn't help.

I'm pretty sure I'm getting more content and interaction from the north on reddit than in game. So, yea- pretty sure it's working.

What ship/fit are you using?

Downvotes are fine, but it would be much more productive if those disagreeing would share their views as to why they have this opinion instead of out right silencing an argument.

I grew up in former Yugoslavia, a country was mix of 7 nations and was held together by Tito and secret police opression. Serbs were the largest nation and serbian rulers pretty much wanted to create the Greater Serbia from Yugoslavia. There were pre-existing tensions between nations.  With Tito's death, relations between the six republics began to deteriorate, and the communist leadership began to fragment along national lines. 
---
We couldn't say anything critical of socialism, Yugoslavism, Titoism, or any other "holy cow" of the system unless you were prepared to be put on black lists, excluded from finding employment, monitored by secret police, and even tortured or killed if you presented a big enough threat. Our core cultural values that define the Yugoslavia nation was crushed by nationalism.     
---
China has what Mao called the people's democratic dictatorship and is known as the United Front (like Tito). the Communist Party is the ruling ideological organ, but alongside it are eight democratic parties, all reflecting the interests of the different class elements that exist within China. Maoism replaced by State capitalism with Marxist Revisionism, both willing to work toward socialism and desiring the preservation and expansion of private enterprise. There is no simple yes or no answer as to  redefine who you are.
---
Anyway*,* I hope China better than former Yugoslavia.  We had a god damn war it had to go in such a horribly ugly result, now people won't even consider it ever again.
---
Yes.
---
I get why CCP put it in, it sucks to have IRL intrude to the point where you have to unsubscribe for a bit, only to come back and find all of your things are gone or locked in a station you no longer have access to. I bet plenty of people have been dissuaded from coming back because it.
---
However, this system is way too safe. And citadel spam is fucking terrible. Asset safety should be rolled back to some degree, and loot from active players should drop when the citadel dies.
---
That would be ok.
---
You realize how easy it would be for all alliances to move their primary staging to an npc station, right? 
---
All this does is make supers/titans harder to store, which in reality would make them even cheaper, since anyone with a decent stockpile would want to sell off some of the extras, or train a few more alts to be able to sit in one and just store them that way.
---
A total removal won't be accepted neither by most of the playerbase nor by CCP.
---
There is a more nuanced way of modifying it that should still create lots of content. CCP should make a mobile structure that should revert the 15% asset safety tax to its owner corporation's wallet when a citadel dies next to it. Takes 5-6 days to anchor. Has tank (and damage cap) of an astrahus, but no timers (so dies in 30m and needs to be protected 24/7). The money should typically accumulate slowly after the kill, but it should still be a lot of money to motivate big entities to kill big hubs and small entities to kill smaller citadels.
---
There are lots of issues around this suggestion and I have it all worked out. I will make a longer post soon.
---
It can't estimate that range, because it doesn't show an estimate of the range when you use dscan. The only way for us, the pilots, to tell within what range that is, is if we manually adjust the dscan range until we get a "pretty close" estimate.
---
The reason it can't estimate the range is because if it COULD estimate the range, there's no reason for it not to show the estimate.
---
&gt;Since this isn't the case, we have to conclude that d-scan "somehow" can tell if the distance of a signal is within a certain range via an internal setting, but it cannot tell what that range is. Which isn't something that exists.
---
&gt; Say it's the black box trying to signal for rescue or something. 
---
This is a good enough suggestion that I've seen it several times. 
---
I guess CCP is concerned players would figure out a way to farm the sites (we would) but it would still be interesting and fun gameplay.
---
There used to be time when roaming null solo was awesome. Using bigger ship was still possible, now you just get dropped by a random ratting carrier each time :(

Excellent tip. The actual game starts when you leave highsec. 
---
Next step would be to find a right kind of group that has active players in the same timezone as you.
---
Idk, everyone in null (except CVA) seems pretty fuckin toxic so far
---
Good observation. Maximizing AFK time defeats the purpose of playing the game.
---
Would be nice to see if CCP have big balls doing something different for once....

Endless possibility for a game that have 8000 systems and 50% are empty I mean wtf do something with it fill it with npc factions owning stations and shit make it a living area.

Sounds about right, but remember that is 100hrs of AFK mining, not 100hrs of carrier ratting or incursion running.
---
Absolutely agree. Asset safety should either cost significantly to sustain from an alliance / corporation level or be removed. It shouldn’t be available by default to people living in null sec. Low sec and high sec I am unsure about. 
---
Given how safe 0.0 space has become, introducing some risk will go a long way.

This is just anecdotal evidence, but the few autistic people I've met who heard someone yell anything started yelling as well.
---
There's a decent chance it's just a coincidence, but to me (who did not bother to look that up), it's not surprising to hear a group of people "yelling" being associated with autism.
---
Maybe OP had a similar experience, maybe he's just being rude.

I can understand that the stereotype comes from actual behavior, but calling such a thing "peak autism" makes it more likely the rude side.

Lol.. blueing up the biggest chinese alliance from SQ and putting them in your backyard next to the biggest chinese community on TQ who are your enemies. Protecting them, letting them get sp and assets, what could go wrong?
---
Lets see how long it takes for MANGO to backstab TEST and join forces with FRAT&amp;friends. At least it would make for an interesting twist and probably a real war would follow ;)
---
asset safety was always retarded
---
I like asset safety because it means I don't have to always worry about which station this ship or that ship is in. If my alliance decides we can't defend a certain structure, I'm not totally fucked.
---
Pretty much no different than stations used to be, except I firesale for a bit more isk.
---
Just standard bronze, and I kinda like the print lines.
---
For my first nullsec travel it was up in Pure Blind or Tribute I think. One of the regions north of the Caldari area. I managed to do a bit of checking out nullsec (warping to stuff, looking at all the stuff Id never seen before, etc) for about 40 minutes before someone tackled me on a gate and killed me, but I wasn’t mad at him. I was more mad at my hisec corp for lying that badly about how supposedly dangerous nullsec was. Needless to say soon after I began looking into nullsec corps thus starting the next chapter of my Eve Online Career xD

[TRI POV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf_uVzviXn0&amp;feature=youtu.be) for anyone whos interested  
---
yeah it was a nice little brawl and then quite the escalation, fun was had
---
I feel like no, it should stay as it was present under conquerable stations (in a different form) however it needs some changes.
---
I'm no game designer but perhaps consider:
---
1 . Remove asset safety being delivered to another structure in the same system entirely.
---
2. Randomly select an NPC structure in any NPC null or Lowsec system to deposit the asset safety per structure on time of death. This introduces effort to recover your stuff if you need to go 5 regions away and if each citadel you have stuff in is spread everywhere.
---
3. Increase the lockout period before recovery and increase the cost of recovery. Alternatively it may be an incentive if a portion of the tax was paid to the corp/alliance who killed the structure.
---
Essentially, just make it more of a pain to deal with which will make it more appealing to actively defend.
---
I usually don’t comment on shit like this but in fairness lynching radakos over his comments when the OP removed any surrounding char makes it hard to determine the context.
---
Perhaps the OP just antagonised and baited radakos into the comments by using similar language?

Maybe I can jump out a wh and get test titans and supers dropped on nano

---
We were offered asset safety in wormhole space. But that goes straight against all that wormhole life stands for. On the other hand, nullsec had no asset safety prior, but losing a structure would mean you'd be unable to access your asset for any amount of time.  
---
If we were to remove asset safety in 0.0, there will be very little incentive for many people to stick around, as losing assets is a bitch to experience, especially if it's in a timezone you may not be able to defend it.
---
I remember this. Are memories like these really competing with with life events like my ex wife and the military? Fuck me bros, bring it in

---
They are also the most professional botter.
---
I would rather see the structure spam being addressed by effectively returning to a hard-cap on structures in a system, based on the size of that system. So a system with two planets, four moons and a few stargates would (for example) be limited to 6 structures systemwide, no matter who owns them.
---
Now what they don't tell you, is PanFam formed to attack the fort, and imperium seeing the possibility of humiliating PanFam, rage formed a thousand, only for panfam to blueball imperium...

---
You technically can never lose if you don't undock
---
Asset safety should be a Service Module. 
---
When the module turns off for any reason (fuel, structure un-anchoring/destruction, etc), all assets get chucked into Safety Wrap. 
---
If the structure is still there, the contents are _retrievable for free from that structure_. You can pull things out of Safety Wrap at any time. But you cannot put things back in unless the Service Module is running again.

You forget GOTG

If you want to make more isk and pvp with thousands of players in large coalitions, go to nullsec.
---
If you want to make more isk and pvp with more than just your ship at risk, go to wormholes.
---
If you want to practice pvp but not make much isk, go to Faction Warfare regions of lowsec.  
---
Lowsec and nullsec have asset safety. If a citadel is blown up, your stuff is moved to lowsec and you pay 15% to recover it. There is no asset safety in wormholes. Good luck!

It really sounds awfully like a monologue from a SCP employee
---
I mean it's your right to speak whatever you want and being defiant to "an authoritarian government's insecurities". It doesn't hurt you personally anyway. The worst that can happen to you is some of your corp mates just disappear but you will assume they just AFK'd. That probably wouldn't happen often.
---
It's another thing when you wonder why those Chinese players are mad at you when you spam those things however. You deserves to be disliked when someone tells you what you are doing can get them into trouble but you keep doing it. It's like putting a pack of cigarettes in a minor's bag to make fun of him --- it's mostly a harmless joke but if he asks you to stop and you keep doing it, you will not be liked. Of course, doing this to enemies are just trolling, but doing this to **allies** means you don't value them much at all.
---
That's why TEST leadership accepted the terms because they understand those jokes are just trolling against enemies --- FRT in this case. But if some of those people are willing to become allies, realpolitik dictates that they will need to tune down their rhetoric a bit.
---
No offence, but if we reported botters, every goon who doesn't like somebody, or a guy who is mining his spod rock will get reported as a botter.. It would be cancer on a stick served cold. Besides, it not like getting booted from goons would stop the botters. As a playerbase, there is little we can do to combat botting. That is up to CCP.

i think it will make people even more risk averse than they currently are and have them polarize towards the few ns superblocks that can actually defend.

You guys keep bringing whs into the discussion but imagine whs without the mass limits and connection instability and let me guarantee you that the larger entities would instantly go on a "harvest roam" every evening. 
---
Exactly this will go on in null as well.
---
Im not advocating it shouldnt be touched, but removing it just like in the whs I don t think is a good idea.
---
what the fuck are you even talking about
---
That said, in the past if you left your assets at a station you can still firesale it via contracts, and I believe remote sell orders. That is easier if you have a jump clone at the station; you can even try to put everything on your ship and jump out. It's one of those things that allows people a sense of safety when they go AFK; if asset safety is removed in null that simply means people are not going to put their assets in null for the fear of losing them --- or they just don't come back after going AFK knowing they've lost all their assets.
---

a couple of autz dudes usually go out every day and ping some structures, but they usually fly stuff like thrashers or vexors and there's only ever 5-6 of them so basically what happens is they ping the structure, a gunner logs in and forces them off, and then they go ping another structure

AFK VNI ratting is the ONLY way to make isk in null. Otherwise you just get cloaky camped and constantly roamed. Sell the supers and swap to a 70m VNI. You won't regret it but your enemies will. You'll blend in with all the VNI bots in null free to make droplets of isk.

Yes. The ping for the carriers that went after all 3 logis had been lost. Nothing on standby. Tri blobbed 20 t3s with 40 t3s, got dropped.

---
Or change mechanics so that the empty systems become populated by players again.
---
High populated systems/regions would slowly become empty of sites/resources and low populated systems would get richer. It used to be like that ages ago.
---
SRP my Guardian! :shakes fist:
---
I think every constellation in nullsec should be able to have one citadel with asset safety. You designate it during anchoring and it can only be changed to another by destroying/unanchoring the current one (which obviously triggers asset safety). 
---
Anyone who wants their stuff to be safe long term bases out of that citadel, all the other citadels are trading safety for convenience.

What I've found during the years is that if you have to choose a single game to waste your time in - Eve is one of the best options. Unless you are into esports.
---
At least I've learned loads of stuff that have been useful in real life also and met people who I call friends even outside of this silly game. Haven't learned much when playing other games or made any friends.
---

---
LEGACY is new space refuge centre
---
Frat still exists.
---
It stands for Annihilate My Asshole
---
Eve is a pvp game so punishing for it is kinda silly. There is a reason why you should get sec hits from engaging player ships in high/low but getting them from structures also is just annoying.
---
Don't kink shame me please.
---
The level of risk vs reward throughout the game has been skewed. Asset safety is a great example of this. It should be that high has 100% asset safety as the Empires force an evacuation. Low Sec has, say, 50-66% saved and the rest randomly dropped. Null has 25-33% saved and the rest dropped as loot an then WHs exist as they do now.
---
Also, from an in-game story PoV asset safety in null and wormholes makes no sense. The whole point is that empires aren't meant to be able to help you so who's evacuating for you in null?
---
Honestly? I think that null has become far too safe and the changes made to do this have detrimentally impacted the rest of the game (citadels in FW meaning you don't have the risk of flying the pipe to offensively plex, WHs finding it harder to get fights because of the structure grind etc).
---
Would you accept if CCP made you some kind of offer to extend it?
---
Too autistic for them to take you? Sorry, bro.
---
Exhibit #47,739,178 proving reddit posts after dropping speed are a bad idea
---
But that's the problem, surely? It means no-one has to defend anything as, when coupled with how in-balanced mining was, no-one cares if they lose a citadel as they can easily replace them and everything in them.
---
Now there, that actually makes sense. I had not seen those skins on those battleships. They make them look so good.
---
I don’t actually want all skins to apply to all ships. Some ships are made by specific corporations, they would not use the livery of another corporations [EVE IP rights (internal to New Eden, not CCP), and some of them would not have their identity personified by the wrong faction.
---
I think that’s a close relation to how we treat flags and symbols. The Yakuza will skin a person for wearing their tattoo patterns when not Yakuza themselves. Wear a New York Yankees hat in Boston and see where that’ll get you an ass kicking. Stuff like that.
---
So, for those skins, those should not be universal. That makes sense, it’s internally consistent.
---
For ‘commercial’ skins, those should be available for all ships that want to bear them.
---
My two cents.
---
Way easier: 
---
Drop asset safety in null, lose 50% of your assets in lowsec and have the other half shipped to nearest have NPC station. 
---
Leave high sec as it is. 
---
Suddenly people will care about their structures.
---
God is overrated.
---
Send ISK.
---
Not for long if Imperium would join Legacy there so they can't really do much against frat without destroying their own content.
---
Ask me Anything, or a Question and Answers session.
---
See /r/ama to see it in the wild.
---
btw but if you think about it, that only affects lowsec. Null/wormholes only timers you get is 60sec weapon aggro and 15min logoff timer.
---

PL brings their activity stealth? Probably should widot already.
---
Simply: No. Nullsec is where you want to have your players. A nullsec player is more engaged and is more likely to stick with the game. If you put up this damocles sword (especially for smaller groups) of "I could lose everything I own", you will have less people (especially newbros) coming to nullsec. Which means less activity etc.  
---
And for what? What is it that you win with No Assest Safety? From a strategic standpoint, it's already a big hit because the assests get taken out of the game for a while. That is enough to be useful in any offensive campaign or war...

If you have them unblocked....you need to check your levels of retardation.

You could even be motivated to fight back and take control of the station to get your assets back...
---
Yeah, remove EVE!
---
Not just some game mechanic, a guy or two at CCP can be behind the project, and the day the community finds a way to deal easily, they change the trig behavior, so we can think that they "learn/adapt"
---
I'd rather have a dynamic system that lowers defenses or increases the cost with more and more structures.   
---
But in general, I agree that the structure spam should be limited somehow.
---
Who is Casper?

Careful now, if they become more risky than normal null security gates then why would anyone bother installing and fueling jump bridges anymore?

no dino in local
---

---
First, i agree, risk/reward is not give under the current mechanic for most of the assets, so remove asset savety entirly.
---
BUT: keep it for blueprint ORIGINALS, they are worth years of research. 
---
Lore: BPO are just data, you can put them on a interstellar fax machine and send them to savety, paying 15% of NPC falue as fee. 
---
BPCs cant get saved, because noone can read the copy of a copy in RL (keep shitty copys from your teacher in mind). Therefore, and when it comes to people's safety, CONCORD prohibits the use of badly legible construction plans.

---
Yes
---
It can be, but I can't answer that myself. If depend on how highly you value one as a source of income. Many people do feel it's worth the injectors though, and you can eventually hit a critical mass where you have enough going that you can make one with only a couple days mining. Also, the main reason it take a long time to train from a exhumer to a rorq is that there is almost no cross-train. If you are starting fresh it takes only a little longer to use a rorq then it takes to train into an exhumer.

A structure is still player owned, so anywhere where sec matters than is should apply, don't like it, wardec them and you won't get a sec change, they're wardecable cause they have a structure and if they've keen afk for a while and haven't fueled their structure then it'll be low power and only 1 timer

I see krabs i upvote
---
both on 7day rank and 90day rank pl is nr. 6, with far from the same amount of members as the other top 10 alliances. PL is one of the most active alliances in eve.

since they removed the stations in null you kind off can.

I am for asset safety for one simple reason: if I decide to take 2 week break I don't have to worry about the safety of my hanger.    Most people quit and return to Eve multiple times.  Asset safety makes the return far far far easier

---
get straight what autism means....
---
From perspective big groups and higsec wardecers - YES REMOVE IT!           
---
From perspective of any one that try to be independent in nullsec and 99% of higsec population - NO DON'T REMOVE IT.            
---
Facts are simple, in nullsec big groups will just startup big fleets and clean structures of all groups they can - thus killing all small alliances.                
---
In higsec wardecers will do the same to all players they can.          
---
So the question is not about asset safety but about - how fast we want to kill off (make quit) people that don't enjoy bloob wars.
---
That would be ideal, but at some point you run into the bottleneck again. By hard limiting the structure count in 0.0, you also force people to use systems strategically for what they want to do. Not every system should be viable for all structures.
---
Stop ruining their narrative with your facts pls.
---
Asset safety in null sec should not exist - it should work just like in Wormholes. Even from a lore perspective it just makes no sense. 
---
It would be a great way of removing assets and isk from the broken economy if wormholes mechanics were used.
---
High Sec asset safety should still be in place as it is currently.
---
Low-Sec not sure what would be best - maybe a middle ground of sorts.
---
The only issue I see is that if a pilot goes AFK due to real he he stands to lose a lot - how is this different from the old outpost mechanic whereby your stuff was locked in the station when ownership changed hands? At best you would do a contract firesale to the new occupants - your enemies...!
---
One of your earliest lessons in EVE is that as sec status decreases , risk increases. Null Sec is supposed to be on the same level of risk as wormholes.
---
Don't act like you're as thick as pig shit, my dude. Panfam have no balls.

downvotes are from the risk averse who stand to lose their hard earned isk.

or from those that just appreciate the convenience.

I was listening to a podcast recently and dont recall who it was, leader of an alliance, stated how he had a Titan in a citadel that was about to go down, think he was not directly involved in the conflict, he was allied to the citadel owner - and he made the choice to just asset safety his titan out and take the isk loss.
---
I suppose he could just jump it out and still been fine - but that also involves a certain amount of risk and might have led to him losing it.
---
This post confused me more than anything... but in a pleasant way. If that makes sense...

---
People who go on about asset safety in nullsec are dumb, if you want part of the asset safety pie then go and secure the low sec asset safety systems and camp them like others are doing.    So people pay 15% of the value of their stuff which is a large ISK sink.   Then they still have to get their things out of systems that are at least two systems deep in lowsec.    In the south a lot of the stations are kick out stations which get expertly camped.
---
That is why when I see people moaning about asset safety all I think is that these people do not want to go to the extra effort to get hold of some of that dank loot.
---
The knock on affect is that most small or medium alliances would be easily head shot, next issue is that most players will only put in the bare minimum because of this.    So when people come roaming in and all the locals have is doctrine ships or ratting / mining ships and unsuitable rapid response ships they will either not engage or drop caps and people will moan even more about the lack of decent content.
---
At least you mentioned that smaller alliances will get steamrolled so you at least get the issue.
---
Thanks man glad to hear it :)

But where did it end up and what about the risk moving it from there, it is not like he can dock up is it.

---
Is remembering something from a year ago normally a feat?
---
Only 5 ly range, there is probably 3 places in all of EVE geography where that is true
---
My idea from the beginning was that asset safety shouldn´t come with every structure. Let it be something that only Citatels have from the size large and up, and if you want to have it on other structures, introduce a service module. Or move it to a service module alltogether, which uses much more fuel than other service modules. Like this you would pay for the security, and not every structure would have it. More importantly, abandones structures can be looted because of it, while structures who get fueled would be safe(er)
---
Okay thanks. Now I see the insane scale of these rorq miners haha.

This comes up all the time. Nothing is different here than the last 50 times it was posted, so it just gets annoying, hence all the downvotes

As a standard line member, i applaud what they are doing.

I very much agree.

They already outblobbed them, the tactic was assured.

I like your proposal of:
---
HS: 100%
---
LS: 50-66%
---
Null: 25-30%
---
Wormhole: stays the same
---
That equates well to the old system of firesale from outposts in Null, where you did not fully lose your assets but  values wise you took a hit.
---
and all this time the answer was so obvious: anything to spite panfam...
---
The pairs of VNI's are, the way they put out drones when pointed and recalled them once it dropped every time instead of aggressing makes it obvious there's no player tending them at the other end.
---
The standart answer for "i don't have any more arguments".
---
The old outposts had a system whereby you lost a lot of value when ownership changed - it worked and did not stop anyone from keeping assets in null. Why would it be any different now?
---
is this a bot?

So that dice is how ships are repackaged to fit in t1 haulers

The EVE universe is supposed to be harsh - are we not "famed" for being the MMO where loss really hurts?

Selfish point of view - see the big picture - this game that you enjoy playing is hurting because of attitudes like yours.

Maybe you should spend 5 more seconds and read below on the oxford english dictionary about how those pile of sticks where used to burn gays and others to death.

You’re agreeing with me..
---
Yeah, you got me. Your lack of basic knowledge about game mechanics is me lacking arguments
---
Oh, EVE used to be a hard game and you had to think twice before putting all your stuff into one POS. Nowdays, people are just lazy. Remove asset safety. Make EVE require some brain again.
---
Fun Fact, the Caps you speak of were NOT in system when OP started, they had to be gated in. I was surprised, but people told me that Caps can actually take gates ...
---
I'd quit goons if I found out what The Mittani looks like, how he presents yourself and his mannerisms.
---
it's pure cringe, how can goons live with themselves
---
Is that worse than be the little bitch of Mittani or brisc, respectively a wizard and american lobbyist.?
---
Actually not true.
---
Null sec will always be a draw for players - it didn't stop players going null in the past...
---
Never have I, in the past (in the times of outposts), heard a player use asset loss as a reason for avoiding null sec.
---
Consider this parallel universe:
---
CCP introduces Citadels and the words "asset safety" &amp; their corresponding mechanic are never mentioned.
---
CCP introduces a sliding % scale of recovery as region sec status decreases.
---
The playerbase is none the wiser and accepts it.
---
Life moves on and people view it as similar system to what was had in the past.
---
Well yes but that because your adjusting the signal strength  to see when it does not show up. In real eve you probably have a estimate off range done automatically. But CCP didn't give us this for some reason.
---
I've seen d scan in others games and it seem to be the same concept.
---
Neither because even if all there afk people returned tidi would soon make them afk again until ccp sort out server issues for larger engagements most will stay afk or keep krabbing
---
Yikes.

Yes I do. If you are a super respected FC and everything seems fine. Why leave?

But what really bothers me is not that he left or why, but how.
---
You dont tell your mates lies for no reason - he did. Thats not nice...
---
Dominion came out ten years ago. Anything truly horrifying can be blamed on "Oh it was a different time".
---
l see it as a off shoot of abyssal space you can live there the only way to move areas is with use of a new type abyssal key.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Tir 2 key opens up a random pocket sealed pocket like going into a new WH
---
So other players can't spawn into them they wouldn't have the 20 mins cd lets say they would have a time limit a 1-3 hrs so that you would have time to do all the sigs then go back to there home pocket and drop off loot in there own or corp station.
---
There would have to be some sort of key that would let you come back to real space.
---
Also the size of the "pockets" would be bigger then the area we have with abyssal space but l would make them smaller then WH systems as there no planets but they have a number of combat/relic/data/ore sigs depending on the tir of the key used.
---
&amp;nbsp; 
---
You could put the best ore (or other min or item or gas) in the game in there and no rorqs so you could get very rich but using other ORE ships.
---
l know this will get bashed but l think its a very rough idea of a good use of the Abyssal and WH tech we have, all you hear about is Null this Null that pvp wars but what about the other side of the game PvE very long winded lol.

Is that an old domi wtf ?

NC would because of size and their income. That said in this scenario hell would also have to freeze over, so who really knows.

Your assets aren't "safe".  Once transferred there's a hefty fee to release them, notwithstanding the fact you also have to move or sell them at their new, rather inconvenient location.

what happens to caps then? If a player goes away for a year, would they ever think to come back knowing their caps were most likely gone? The only choice a player would have to save their cap would be a safe log, then roll the dice when they come back to the game.
---
[fc+]
---
how many tiers are there to tapi's fc program currently? just wondering
---
Snuff batphone on the armor timer was 150 Init Bombers adding to 150 tripleboxed Snuff-Accounts, your formup was 2,5:1 with 200 Caps and NCPL had Titans logged in in SH1
---
&gt;  or increases the cost with more and more structures
---
So people would just place them in holding corp. If systems had a cap alliances would place the max to make sure enemies can not place any in that system.
---
Not that I am shooting these ideas down, we do need a solution.
---
It doesn't help that in all yugoslavian countries, nationalism runs rampant like a massive cancer. And it's not just nationalism, it's highly vitriolic hate against anything that isn't Serbia/Croatia, and also the purest form of white pride. In my experience, every single serbian I've met in my life has shown some degree of racism (mostly against turks and muslims, although this I could even understand since they've been at war before in history) but also an overwhelming hate for anything that isn't Serbia. It's the same for Albanians too, their overwhelming pride for their country stems more from an inferiority complex, mostly due to the fact their country hasn't achieved anything notable since Skanderbeg. 
---
Also you said people won't even consider again, that's simply pure bullshit. Look at the tension between Albania and Serbia (because of the region of Great Albania), where politicians play little racist games against each other and flame up the conflict even more. If the EU wasn't close and if these countries weren't interested in joining the EU (to profit from the western standards that we have because we stopped genociding each other), Serbians and Albanians would be immediately trying to kill each other to the last man.
---
I live in a country where ex-Yugoslavians and Albanians are about 15% of the population, by far the biggest group of foreigners in my country. This includes citizen or rather immigrants from virtually every balkanese country.
---
Coincidentally also the ones that commit 85% of the crimes recorded. They parade through the streets with their flags whenever something happens involving their home countries, have street fights and riotings against other yugoslavian nationals or Albanians, and simply refuse to integrate, because their home country and culture must be vastly superior than ours... Yeah, that's why you're in my country and not in your own?
---
I have strategically left out Montenegro and Bulgarians out of my slightly narrow-minded rant, because I've only had very good experiences with people from these countries. Montenegrins are VERY friendly and welcoming people and are literally the opposite than an angry, nationalist Serb with a superiority complex.
---
So they did exactly what PanFam did on the armor timer of that Fort, seeing Snuff and Init had about 300 people and nor Supers, well lets form close to 700 with 200 Caps and login the bibbois ...

If that was the case then groups would just place enough structures in order to hit the cap on purpose, locking anyone else out. The way it is now if you want to protect your system you have to pay attention and make sure no one else in anchoring in your system.
---
looks like you just have to deny the time they need for batphoning and block formup, and it can be nice even brawls ...who would have thought
---
Yea. As hateful Goon shitlord #231 you just convinced me to not share ideas that'd actually be helpful for the game.

I am awaiting said apology for poor conduct from test leadership. I hope (if war stops) that this condition is met, both to winterco as well as to test line members.
---
I can reveal which one but I'll need a pledge of about 24k $ first.
---
The thing is Line member 99998 losing all his shit in a war means nothing to an alliance, it is a drop in the ocean. It is on the other hand real cash from CCP's pockets when that person says fuck this shit and does not log back in. That is why for the most part asset safety is here to stay no matter what people on Reddit say, as it is money out of CCP's pocket.
---
Whatever people think asset safety brakes CCP will try and fix without putting their player base at risk.
---
What the hell are you talking about?  
---
Losing utility by virtue of loss of access to services is not the same thing as losing your assets. I had shit gathered over the last 8 years in 12 nullsec regions delivered safely back to me because of asset safety after the old outposts got converted and unanchored because of their value.
---
I would probably have been a lot more careful about recovering those assets if there was a risk I would lose them if left behind. Your argument makes no sense; the previous outpost system did nothing to project real risk of loss on a player. At the most it was 'inconvenient' because your stuff was locked in, but it was still yours, and you could still sell it away if you didn't want to hold it.
---
Always love when they bring a few extra friends.  Come for the rorq stay for the hel's and lif

So do we want citadels to be unkillable? or for them to be volatile? If CCP removes asset safety, we would just get unkillable citadels instead because CCP wants returning players to resub.

You could negotiate access rights you could sell your assets at a markup or firesale or you could just either wait to regain control of the station or join the "enemy" until you had your assets back. New system you straight up lose 10% of the value no matter what and you now have to fly god knows where in lowsec for the privileged of wasting the isk for your assets which are now in a hell camped low sec station. Now before you could take a week of overtime in real life and not be to worried about your ingame assets as opposed to the current system where you need to freight your crap out to high whenever RL requires you to take a week off. This only leads to less content because now most of my assets have to be high so there are either op response fleets or no form ups wheras before if a red was in local any jumps out I could hope in any of my ships and whelp until enough content was had.
---
Do it!
---
Where you go all depends on what you want to do. Some of the big null blocs are good if you are not sure, they are large enough that you can try a bit of everything (wormholes, black ops or just being and F1 monkey) and they have training programs to help you learn the ropes. Look for Karmafleet, Brand Newbros, Brave and Horde if that takes your fancy.
---
If you already have a good idea what you to do, check out /r/evejobs for a corp that is looking to do the same stuff as you and is in the same general time zone.
---
Would be cool if they cut off a region from the universe. Deactivate all gates in/out so you have to use wormholes to get in but once you're in you can travel around. Or maybe that would just become a krab safe space. Idk.
---
There is literally no reason to claim space new/more for anyone in the game right now.
---
"Hey guys, everyone laugh at this kid so I can feel better about myself!"
---
I sure am..  i was just venting
---
Just one, Yelly man.
---
Ah alright ) I was a wee bit confused
---
In null sec asset safety increases confidence in holding large stocks of personal ships. That means more pew pew, all be it meaningless most of the time. 
---
Removing that safety net could have a host of bad consequences.
---
Loot incentives is areally pathetic pubbie concept tho
---
War means sov being lost and citidels being destroyed, inevitably line members will lose their stuff if no asset safety. 
---
The people that suffer here is newbros that didnt understand why they lost there stuff. 
---
Plus I want more reasons for alliances to go to war. Not more reasons for them to make peace treaties.
---
TIL Delve is closer to Pure Blind than Tribute.
---
Hit me with your best narrative or spin that comes out of this!
---
Hmmmmm.  That seems a bit unlikely.  Let me trawl through your past comments just to check... second thoughts, I can't be bothered.
---
They have 3 timers in which to vacate their stuff if they feel the structure is at risk. 
---
I think we might be opposed in what we think will drive a war or conflicts. I personally think that structures dropping loot or partial loot are a very compelling reason to undock. Both defence and offence.
---
Old system did not project real full loss.
---
Projected inconvenience if you just left there like you did or a real partial loss if you chose to firesale. Asset safety has an in-built cost to it but I don't think its enough and its not representative of the supposed harshness of the EVE universe.
---
Isn't there supposed to be some realism to the game?
---
How is asset safety even explained? Teleportation?
---
Station blows up and your shit goes to nearest lowsec... 
---
Imo it should be like wormholes.
---
Liven up the stale fights.
---
But most people cant deal with that so id settle for a sliding scale according to sec status.
---
in a fc- fleet, you  pay SRP to Test, even if your ship survives!
---
Thanks for proving my point. More random talk with no argument/evidence.
---
Yeah but in US they don't get shot to death or get arrested by saying 9/11 on facebook LUL
---
Enjoy your Koolaid and take care of your health, you seem endangered for heart attacks ... also I kill goons since 2007, PanFam since 2012 ... so xour silly block-lemming your narratives dont count for me
---
Am I missing something here? Is this accepted meta language within a part of the EVE community?
---
Fail Spy they all are friends in RL from what I understand, is PROGOD from New Orleans? :o
---
If players where intentionally DDOSing enemies there'd be a shitstorm
---
Idk i heard test already blued them or something and them going to the South.
---
When the goon passes the spod, say no kids!
---
Dive into the deep end and embrace the survival aspects where Intel, wise ship choices, superioir piloting practices will keep you alive in an environment trying to kill you.
---
You'll find new ways to make ISK no matter where you go, but main thing is using your brain to survive and to take the hits when you don't.
---
What's the news about this? Some of the leaders or leading FCs are talking to each other. That is like daily business...
---
Nobody ever put "all their stuff" into one POS.  The stuff they definitely didn't want to lose was in an indestructable station somewhere.
---
I tile local with the fleet window. I follow broadcasts, not local spam .
---
In my opinion the problem was, there wasnt a separate staging fort with a market for the alliance.. Having a public market for ur staging is an invitation for spais to do market pvp while we formed.. PGL calls refit to to EM resi -&gt; spai relists all em-ward fields..
---
Implying the spam stops when fighting starts
---
In the past there was no asset safety because outposts couldn't be destroyed. So your assets were never destructed.
---
A parallel universe if of no value btw, because we have to deal with the universe we have.
---
I feel attacked :(
---
There doesn't need to be a "because".  Your idea is just shit.  Please stop having them.
---
If fuel cost would increase with every structure in system, than a holding corp would have no impact at all.
---
The hardcap is problematic for several reasons and the one you mentioned is the most obvious one. You simply spam the cap-amount of raitarus and take them down if you want to place a real structure.
---
No
---
Thread over.
---
Much appreciated!
---
damn this sub needs to let its obsession with RnK go, Pretty much none of those original dudes play anymore, nor is their playstyle viable in the shit meta we have now.
---
delete EVE or move to highsec
---
There's a discord that every major bloc diplo, exec and FC share. They just wanted some privacy from them
---
triglavs like darkmode, but they like old.reddit more
---
&gt;with only a few changes
---
What EVE are you playing? The last patchnotes were super long with massive balance changes AND a lot of new ships (triglavians) in the recent month. So, there is no "holding back" from CCP at all.  
---
&gt; A war that would be so deadly that even goons/Tapi/NC.co would step back, and ask help from others coalitions. 
---
Until one of those big players is force to ask for help from others, the others would most likely already be gone and destroyed.   
---
The idea is nice from a story-telling viewpoint. For an actual game this would be the worst. There is no need to "renew" EVE or restart the server or whatever. What makes EVE so special is the long history of player-made decisions.
---
The rumor on r/eve is that they left to serentiy cos they were too pussy. TBH everyone who was around with them says they were an incredibly risk averse group so i can buy that.
---
o7 enjoy RL
---
https://imgur.com/a/9mJmsHm
---
Quite many changes this release too, your feedback is more than welcome. Hopefully I did not break anything - had very limited time to test it out on Windows and Mac.
---
&gt;If my alliance decides we can't defend a certain structure, I'm not totally fucked.
---
How does that make sense? 
---
I mean in all honesty why wouldan invading force with control of a system let their enemies resources leave the system?
---
No one honestly cares
---
This can only mean one thing. Low-sec gate to Stain is coming.
---
Wouldn't be the first time.  I know better than to TEST Cormak, who apparently is my CEO, though.
---
If CCP did this I would also think they would extend the timers to at least 7 days.  Millions of players only play on the weekends. I don't want longer timers, i want shorter timers.  I want easier to kill citidels not harder to kill ones because players items are now at risk.
---
 Maybe they should remove loot fairy from the citidels, so all modules and corp items are 100% drop rate.
---
Not only larger, but by far more active.
---
All my chat channel's are stacked on top of each other, too.
---
If I'm ratting local is open, else yeah, fleet chat, with the fleet window adjacent so I can follow broadcasts.
---
Tak obraz sie i sobie idz, tupnij jeszcze noga na koniec.
---
Well, as long as they put out nore of those videos. Personally I doubt, that they could hold up to their name, but who knows. I'm not writing them off just yet.
---
.
---
It definitely slows down, can't spam f1 and the horde horn at the same time.
---
&gt;and have them polarize towards the few ns superblocks that can actually defend.
---
People will get more risk adverse, but it'll actually make more content. Blow up a structure to scoop tens of billions in loot is a lot better than just some vague strategic objective. 
---
Also makes more content leading up to big fights. How much do you extract, what do you leave for defense, how do you secure passage out of the system with the loot. What will they bring to our move ops. 
---
Also what do you mean risk adverse? What're people gonna do? Not store their shit in a station in null? That'd even be good. Force people to haul stuff in more often giving more opportunities to get ganked and make more content for players.
---
This, most of the guys left, not sure about their french WH-Wing (Guillotine Therapy) but most other guys quit the game. 2-3 guys of them we still knew from the glorious Syndicate &amp; pipe-bomb days chilled with us in Aridia around 2015 (o7 ShanniaPain), some of the guys LordMaldoror poached from us returned already a few years ago.
---
How do we claim these? Returning player, don't remember...
---
Most pilots left the game, kills ending between 2014 and 2016 (individual players, not the Alliance). Also LM has a pretty treacherous nature, poaching guys from "Friends" and trying to fully disband them to leech of the good pilots. It was good days with a bad end ...
---
&gt;do we want citadels to be unkillable?
---
No, we want less timers, and reducing damage caps for unpowered structures. Have you seen how many abandoned structures and mobile depots litter New Eden?
---
&gt;unkillable citadels
---
Are called npc stations. If you don't want to risk losing your stuff, put it in an npc station.
---
Hey asshole, some of us here use dark theme. Why don't you do everyone a favor and download the mumble snapshot so you don't have to blind us all with your crap sungod mumble spai leaks.
---
&gt; The change I propose is to remove ratting bounty payments (ticks) and  replace that system with rats dropping the equivalent value in blue  loot. 
---
You do not seem to understand the economy of the game. Bounty = ISK, loot = material. If you replace the bounty by material, you have no ISK coming into the game anymore. Or at least, an extreme amount less. That would cause ratting to completely die out, because nobody is able to buy the loot anyway...   
---
So your idea is already pretty much dead from the beginning. Sorry bro
---
Haha, that's exactly what I meant
---
There is no ISK difference. Nobody has a renting-contract that says "if you bot, you pay 5% more" or smth.   
---
It's just easier to pay the rent via bots. That's all.
---
Do you understand that for years the game survived just fine without asset safety? Ive come back recently and it's still weird to me that it exists. Right alongside "don't fly what you can't afford to lose" you'd know not to stockpile assets in a location that you might not control in the future.
---
People still quit and came back. You'd just convert all your significant stuff into isk or plex first. Not everyone did that of course and you'd sometimes get spectacular loot drops when structures fell.
---
The very attitude you're displaying is why the whole concept is weird to me. What experienced player would be so attached to their eve stuff? Assets in eve are tools that you expend in pursuit of your goals. Hoarding stuff beyond what you need to do what you do and expecting to never lose it... I understand the appeal but I'm not sure it builds an attitude that's healthy for the game.  To me the tremendous risk in eve is part of the thrill. Meaningful loss doesn't exist in other games I've played and I would never gamble with my real life in the same way. I think eve is successful because of meaningful loss not in spite of it. You think you'd hate to have all your space toys on the line, but I think if you tried it the game would feel far more like a proper adventure.
---
That's where you are far off the reality.
---
Not really true, can remember many fights (we were blued by them living next door as they hunted us 6 months without result) where we went in with 20-40 guys vs. 200-400 Nullseccers, one day we even mistakenly jumped our corp-titan into B-DBYQ instead of bridging right in the middle of a 250-ppl-Goon/FA-Fleet, then had to burn 4 jumps from A-S and saved it with about 40 people ... It is simply the shitty Mezta nowadays, making their style of play "Few-versus-Many" impossible
---
I really liked how you reintroduced “add x5” for drones :) in the previous version. Would it be possible to maybe change the add x1000 for laser crystals, nanite paste, and cap boosters to something like x10, x100, x10 respectively?
---
Thanks a bunch for all the work you guys do!
---
TIL INIT lives in delve
---
Finger to the throat means death!
---
Ah yes and no. They can make whs but it takes a lot off power and effort so they make a wh flood through take gates to the other systems and set up.
---
radical as in "no working economy anymore"
---
lol. facts isn't "narrative"
---
alternative facts are
---
Yes, because without the bounties there is no ISK in the game to buy the loot.
---
But is that be the case? In the old system you knew you could lose stations and have everything locked inside and there were more fights than there are now with citadels because they became a strategic objective that could cripple an enemy rather than something to inconvenience them.
---
Null sec is meant to be high risk, high reward. If you don't want to lose ships, you should be in High Sec space. What I have suggested reflects the old mechanics better and will hopefully redress the imbalance between the risk/reward ratios in the game.
---
That is exactly why I don't want to argue about who started the batphone game. You will always say we started, we will always say you started. It's just how it is v0v
---
oh no not that gate in particular
---
yeah, you should probably stop posting them then. 
---
For a guy "not caring about block-lemming narratives" your sure like to be a reddit warrior.
---
yeah, except when im hunting in null i like being able to teleport loot back so keep that bit
---

My left arm feels numb and I'm cold and clammy after reading that.
---
CCP GMs, man some gave numbers others gave vague shitty wording and all of them were different, they really should just have set in stone policy, not whatever the GM feels like today.
---
Please remember CCP will do what we ask but in a way that will not hurt their bot line.
---
If we make players place items in npc stations, CCP will make travelling to said stations easier. So that daily enjoyment does not go down, this will most likely evolve jump bridges gettin more op not better.
---
If player items are at risk such as caps, CCP will make keeping them safe easier. So players do not unsub should they lose every thing valuable. This will most likely evolve citidels being harder to kill not easier, or at the very least loner ref times.
---
In my option corp assets need to be made more volatile not line members.
---
i think i smell burnt toast ... :/
---
wew, the koolaid has made this brain uncapable of using same standards on both sides  ...
---
TLDR: snuff can't fight without capitals, proceeds to blob small alliance
---
just RMT it tbh.
---
can you guys bring the carge-all context menu item back. its annoying to hold a charge in the contextmenu and then press alt to get it to fill all launhcers/turrets. holding alt and then opening the context menu doesnt even work
---
Its on all gates that I know of. Its just easier to see here
---
you even forgot the logged in Titans in SH1 additionaly to the 700 people formed up vs 150 Snuff &amp; 150 Init on armor timer ^^
---
I came here to post this... lol.
---
u must be a shit spai to not have seen that before
---
RemindMe! 11 days
---
Just give it a big NPC zone, far less likely to be a mega krab zone then.
---
Oof
---
Are you calling RnK risk averse or PIBC?
---
Cause the former wtf. Like their whole thing was fighting outnumbered.
---
When they ask INIT like on the armor timer you ask all of PanFam so you can have a 700+Titans formup vs. 300 ppl in Subs with a few Dreads on standby
---
What about binary FCs? FC&amp; FC| FC^ !FC
---
How do you claim the rewards?
---
CCP published a new singularity update this downtime, and it includes a whole lot of new stuff/changes. I'll try to keep this updated with the last findings.
---
&gt; Do you understand that for years the game survived just fine without asset safety? 
---
Because there was an alternate system in place that prevented asset loss, and to an extent, there still is.
---
Diplomacy? in my FC chat? its more likely than you think

Thanks again.
---
You means people and alliances changes in 5 years ? How dare the game not be stagnant !
---
Well, you have a good point. Moomins article is pretty bad and as well as the Mittani he is not able to adress the obvious...  
---
But your shitshow of insults you just wrote down, always trying to downgrade Moomin and displaying you as a better writer is so hilariously ironic, that I have no words to describe it. Stay as you are Salivan, since Seraph and Gobbins are so quiet, the EVE community is lacking that special kind of insanity you obviously bring to the table.
---
We also lost skill point when we died, the past eve was a fucking hell hole. I should not lose items when I am not even online, the lost of my property should be my fault and only my fault. People bitch about login rewards, well this is the same. Log in tonight or lose all your shit in that citidel. I do not want to be forced to log in, i want to log in because i have some thing fun to do or spare time.

He sold it to someone in INIT, that someone seems to have sold it to someone in snuff and that snuff someone sold it to penifsmash.

That's pretty clearly mentioned in the Meta Show, but somehow everyone kept ignoring it.

Kurde, popykalbym sobie w gierke tak jak wy, a nie tylko ciagle arbajt, szlaufen i dziewiedziesiate w drodze z i do roboty, i kwasy w sobote. Tyle ze moj komp jest chujowy. Ciagle czekam az mi CCP wysle obiecana i7- costam za tego zwycieskiego tweeta. Co prawda nigdy nie mialem tweetera ale jakos im to nie przeszkadzalo kiedy oglaszali zwyciezce konkursu. Musze sie przyznac ze wtedy troche ich pod chuja wzialem. Cisnalem ich tam, juz nawet nie pamietam o co i taki wyrzut padl, ze jak beda sobie w Vegas nagrody rozdawali to cos tam odjebie, juz nie pamietam nawet co. No... wiec CCP wszystkie nagrody postanowilo mi wreczyc. Z tym ze ciagle na nie czekam. No nic cierpliwy jestem, no moze nie jestem, ale siestaram. Ale juz bym sobie popykal w EVE tak jak reszta, a nie tylko notesik i posty
---
I do like to see what this is about :)
---
With Pearl Abyss in charge there are no "best times" anymore. Just PLEX sales
---
Take a deep look into the mirror.
---
Did you actually come back after 5 years if so id love to hear what you found the most weird change on the map for you is.
---
Who would have thought Hedliner's posting was actually worse than his FCing.
---
oof
---
OK.
---
Hm. Not particularly impressed with the traits on the trig AF and HAC. I mean, sure, neut powergrid reduction is nice, but as far as actual combat power goes they're looking pretty mediocre. A normal HAC or AF has significantly more damage than their T1 counterparts, but these only get any better once you've shot the same target for eons - the *current* spoolup cap is already long enough, now we get to wait even longer to see any improvement? I guess CCP are worried about making them OP, but right now I look at this and see 500+mil hull cost ships that I wonder why you'd ever fly.
---
The strings of new text looks like they are redoing the intro
---
When Hedliner cries he sounds just like Judy.
---
These will be available when Eve comes out of Alpha Build... 
---
Date - Soon(™)
---
 I like that they are a nerf to krabbing but in the end if they just drop stuff, that's like more krabbing for NS krab that's kind of pointless. At least it doesn't sound like instanced PvE.
---
they have lost the ability to do anything with more than 10 guys by them selves. they still have a handful of people who grind small scale which is what nets you good points on zkill.
---
yes because making the playerbase even more risk averse by removing asset safety will make it all better.
---
You can also stack smartbombs!
---
It looks like they are extending the already existing incursion system they have, and adding triglavian incursions that work similar to the normal incursions.
---
except the fact that they form 200+ subcap and 200+ supercap fleets, sure.
---
Why is TEST in Stain? What happened to Stainwagon?
---
What happened to all the Russians in the drone regions?
---
Why does Pandemic Legion own space? I thought they were busy playing World of Tanks.
---
They are probably going to be a good HAC doctrine for whaling fleet, but the issue is that that's what drekavacs and leshasks already are doing, and they use MJD dessies to escape anyway so no real difference except you're fielding a more expensive ship.
---
&gt; It lags your client if you have logging on.
---
Sooo. Is this considered an exploit and a bannable offense?
---
They are many factors that can change my opinion, like if only NS is concerned and what sort of income can it bring, can you run it in supers or not, etc. I could turn out as a really fun PvE grouped experience, or just more easy cash for krabing.
---
It was a typo. Lots of players underlined this since.

You mean how is our off and on 200 man vs. The entire north in it's own supercap umbrella? Well, let's compare that to NC or PL doing the same along in the last decade. I'll wait for the numbers and BR to compare. Take your time.
---
Deadzoning stations was very rare. If you lost a station, chances are you could firesale your stuff in it quite easily.
---
I would also love to see NPC escalation In difficulty. VNI? Fine, same current difficulty, super carrier= same bounty payout but the NPCs will be more challenging via smaller sig radius, faster, more tackle, and I mean enough tackle to hold a max ratial faction carrier.
---
yet fail to get any killmails without 20 other alliances on it? yea my point
---
So who is the init person that dark shines sold it to exactly?? Should be easily to find out.
---
800 dudes come to fight. Also too busy PVEing against rorquals. Seems like two different narratives.
---
Don't forget pretend fc [pfc]
---
show me any fights between coalitions where there aren't 20 alliances on grid, this is the meta.

---
Yes, remember all those times JFs are killed in null.
---
Should be, but doesn't really matter, does it? 
---
As far as I understood it, the snuff guy used an alt in INIT to buy the Titan. So no violated of the Super-Selling-Rule.
---
I don't have any excavators.  I don't Rorqual mine.  The occasional mining I do is for fuel for my JF and Titan and it's in an Endurance.
---
You'll have to do better than that I'm afraid.
---
i'm pretty sure the tl;dr of your point here is "we formed up more guys than you, why didn't you feed us you cowards"
---
Fuck off will you.  There's a good girl.
---
now this is the sort of ama i can get behind
---
I'm not a lawyer but with NDAs I thought that even talking about there being something to talk about is a violation?
---
Snuff guy having an alt in Init 😆🤷‍♂️ what could go wrong there???
---
Damn that is good but totally fake: not a single “where is fleet, is it too late to catch up?”
---
Me neither. But my gut says it probably was the same as for jumping caps.
---
If anyone wants to know what happened, he's essentially quoting a Trump speech from 6 months ago with words changed to make it eve related. I found [this](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/19/politics/donald-trump-montana-speech/index.html) by googling phrases from the post

---
I don’t know, it’s quite strange... Because they nerf the hell out of drone boats, but as the same time they decrease the cycle time of mining module ? Maybe I didn’t read that right, but that mean mining ships will mine more since they have faster mining modules...
---
I just read on Eve Universiti Wiki that DED complexes have ship restrictions for each rating.

Please tell me that's a fucking joke

Reddit zawsze na propsie. Triglavian z checia poprowadzilby wszystkie redditowe wizytowki do akcji distrojowej na oficjalnym forum. I tylko by patrzyl jak te miekkim chujem robione wizytowki z oficjalnego placza i wykrzykuja: "tak nie wolno! to jest niezgodne z regulaminem! wlasnie zlamaliscie 38 zlota zasade EVE" i inne tego typu smuty. A Obludnik o Falkonskiej Twarzy nie nadazalby z kasowaniem postow i banowaniem. Po wszystkim wrociloby sie na reddita i krecilo beke z lamusow z oficjalnego.

Hull tanking about to go to the next level with abyssal damage controls
---
Except TZ tanking works for us in defence the same way it works for FRT in defence. Truly a wonder we'd want a stronger CHTZ.
---
Imagine not living through 1000 Gleam crystals LUL
---
Anyone know if trig invasions will be a permanent part of the game like incursions, or is it just another event?
---
Outnumbered doesn't have to mean more risk. In fact, often it means less risk because the enemy will underestimate you.
---
No, thats not the point. 
---
Here it is:
---
Bounty = ISK
---
Loot = material
---
You need people with ISK to by material. If you end the by far biggest ISK faucet and turn it into a material faucet, people wont have money to by stuff. Because the ISK (amounts) simply dont exist anymore.
---
And still sucking
---
 **Megathron Triglavian Twilight SKIN (Permanent)** !!!!!!!
---
1,250,000 SP for omega accounts
---
Oh yeah! That starts today, doesn't it?
---
No optimal bonuses on the HAC + AF, mostly useless for actual PvP. The HAC will probably shred shit in abyss.
---
Damavik and the Nergal may become relevant in FW novice and small complexes now, as the resist bonus + pg reduction for neuts will make it an excellent scram kiter or brawler.
---
Also, the Nergal's 2/3/4 layout is what the Damavik's **should** be (and the nergal get an extra low slot + pg), but whatever.
---
most likely like incursions. but not sure
---
1.2m sp.... just a coincidence we get this after the chinese move over here....
---
Girls are gross
---
Does less hull HP mean all things on grid have less hull hp?  As in you can't hit as hard with bombers (since the amount that hit are a function of the bomb's hull hp?)
---
Yeh but 80% of the time if you are fighting outnumbered you are at risk more than not so, especially if as with RnK they had a limited number base so when fighting larger groups they often were fucked if the larger group escalated. 
---
I have no doubt that RnK didnt take fights and were kinda risk averse but comparatively compared to other alliances i think calling them risk averse is a bit of a stretch.
---
Just cause they're talking doesn't mean test wants to stop the war
---
The suggestion has been for something similar to blue loot in wormholes such as bounty tags that you sell to NPC buy orders to get the ISK. How are you comparing that to "materials"? Are you even paying attention to the conversation?
---
It's for the NPE.
---
First they took away the retards. I didn't say anything because I wasn't retarded.
---
Then they came for ~~OP~~ faggots and I didn't say anything because I wasn't OP.
---
Then they came for the autistic, but alas no one was left to speak out.
---
CODE wants to know a lot of things, that doesn't make them any different from any other pirate group :P If they want me, I say good luck to them :P
---
Without the bonus range you won't be able to shoot to scram kite ranges tho.
---
1 mill SP? Damn, they are actually handing out worthwhile gifts? Do they need to boost login numbers?\^\^

"By logging in during the XVI Anniversary Celebration, you are able to claim rewards that pay tribute to EVE's community and history, with rewards such as the legendary Silver Monocle, new Permaband SKINs, XVI Anniversary SKINs and apparel, Absolute Booster, plenty of Skill Points and much more!" 
---
Wheres muh absolute booster CCP....
---
&gt; Do you understand that for years the game survived just fine without asset safety?
---
Asset safety has always been a thing, just never called that way.  It was stations.  You left your stuff in an unkillable station left eve for years and then when you came back all your stuff was still safe and sound in the station even if the station changed hands 10 times.
---
When you came back you had a few choices:  you could make public contracts to sell your stuff.  You could talk to folks in the current holding group and arrange to get stuff transported.  you could join the group currently holding the station and use their freight service to get it out.
---
Did some people live out of POS and store stupid amounts of stuff there sure but that was not the norm.
---
yep this is really a good idea
---
Obviously I have misunderstood that part. Thanks for helping me understand it. ^^
---
spamming chat in fleet ops is more fun than the combat

A always wanted to know what the Echelon was for. Now I see a future for it.
---
Stainwagon is dead. Russian dronelands was just a paper tiger and got evicted by a tiny group of elite pvpers. Pandemic Legion rents out space. Razor got evicted along with XIX and the other drone russians
---
Yeh it is, this was in the game files before the chinese announced their move over.
---
Your flair is appropriate
---
!remindme 10 days
---
&gt;but it'll actually make more content
---
You'd think that, but, unfortunately for the "no asset safety" idea, we're more clever than that.
---
Once we got wind that asset safety was going away, we'd forcibly unanchor every structure we own before the drop date, then re-anchor them afterwards. This will force all line member assets into asset safety before the change. We'd advocate for evacuation into an NPC station for all player assets, and limit the number of structures available for asset storage. Sure, not having keepstars available for titan storage is a bother, but, conveniently enough, skill injectors exist. Parking alts are a lot easier to make nowadays.
---
The "remove asset safety" crowd likes to think that the change will happen in a vacuum and that players will continue to act just as they did before. I guess in their heads, the "other" is some sort of slime mold that can't react to stimuli. Therein lies the danger of viewing other players as food rather than humans.
---
Have you not heard of Mystic?
---
&gt; Hey asshole
---
how about no
---
Meh. As long as Lord Maldoror and his production crew keep kicking out their meta-heavy videos.
---
IMHO, their are few modern day English-language, YouTube-ready documentaries/propaganda with that quality production.
---
Be careful. The way CCP is going these days you might get banned for violating the NDA regardless of whether or not it has expired.
---
TFW no new event fireworks :pepehands:
---
TEST invaded the north and helped evict goons during 2016, then a few months later, we got kicked out of our new home and decided to invade stainwaggon and take their home.
---
Nope, just another standard day in k-space.

---
to be fair, there are a lot of people who comes from countrys where english is not the spoken language...
---
So don't be a dick about spelling mistakes... just think about your russian, chinese or german skills and ask yourself if you where able to play eve in one of those language alliances like they do. Since iam reffering to Eve insted of Reddit it affects reddit in the same way in my opinion :)
---
If you waited out the initial fire sale frenzy then you could easily contract  for 10% under Jita sell.  You could also use courier contracts to get things back to empire.
---
Tak sie zastanawiam, co jest bardziej zalosne? Podpisanie jakiegos z dupy wysranego NDA czy lamanie tego NDA po jego wygasnieciu?
---
If it's anything like current day incursions it'll at least be very had to impossible to bot, so a step up over vanilla krabing.
---
looks also like the kikimora gets a nerf to its pg and dronebay
---
Ark has been added, thumbnail looks like what we've seen being built in abyssal space.
---
Interesting name as well, could this indicate some sort of vessel the Triglavians might use in an invasion of New Eden?
---
You need to log in 16 days during this period to claim the last reward.
---
It's like a clickbait to make you log in, they need to make numbers look good so screw actually giving a present to everyone just because you are celebrating something.
---
You'll be able to shoot Meson, Mystic, and possibly Baryon at scram kite range (7.5k to 11km). Meson would have the farthest reach and still be (eventually) firing 260dps, so you're doing blaster level DPS at least 10km out, and have enough staying power to actually ramp up to that much. Plus a bonused neut on the Nergal, and I think you can make it work versus Hawks, Retris, Vengeances, and Enyos. Kikis would be its main issue though, and you'd need to catch them fast.
---
For? Being able to read what is actually there?
---
you need to log in on 16 days out of the 18 day event
---
OwO

Clever just as a gate camp

Goon disease brain not knowing me, lmao
---
Our tendies baskets were spilled that day. And we have yet to recover from it.
---
I hope they are more similar to Sansha incursions in nature than Drifter incursions. Sure it will be farmable if it's like Sansha, but it's still new content to do. Drifters were not farmable, and then were exploitable to the point where all of it had to be removed. I had fun figuring out AND running Sansha incursions for a long time, Drifter incursions were only fun to figure out, and were boring to run with near 0 variety in sites (the main strat was throwing suicide thrashers at it and getting massive payouts by leeching full-fleet payouts on the other side of the gate).
---

Seems clear now ahah

Do I get a ship that looks identical to a ship in another game?

Then fawlty7 took the next round

B0rt fights nanogangs. Idc what the rest of test does when we're not around, but we're trying to get more fights going. Everyone, test included, has been boring lately, and the change has to start somewhere.
---
In the roadmap for removal anyway
---
[deleted]
---
So? It'll still be good, the resist bonus kinda negates the lack of low slots and thats one of the issues with the Damavik.
---
Its not gonna be god tier, but it might be used more than it is now

well i don't think it can get more casual than spending 30 seconds to log in, claiming reward, log out

Honestly my hope is its not liquid isk I hope what they drop is the mats needed to build the triglav ships to make safe teir 5s in highsec less profitable while making using a actual trig doctrine viable for more people

Have you heard about boosh Raven ? Or how INIT took down a keepstar with NCPL superfleet on grid with T1 battleship ?
---
Its Slavic mythology. Blame them.
---
go ping more structures in autz about it
---
And a big conspiracy holds CCP back from implementing this one weeks work method to remove bots, right?
---
How about you buy yourself into CCP (you must be incredible rich if you earn a million a month) and do it yourself then?
---
That’s bc there is no reason to.
---
He bitched and moaned a lot about stuff.
---
Not incursions, make Triglavs take sov and watch people scramble to try and defend from them and other attackers at the same time. Pleeeeeease.
---
the hac looks like the love child of the drek and the old school ahac zealot
---
Test started an offensive war and have until now taken 0 sov, with their leadership already admitting to burn out.
---
Also, https://i.imgur.com/KO50xbl.png
---
So I am going with doubt on that one.
---
*yawn* About as much oof in your reddit posting as your game play.
---
It's not. Nergal is Sumerian, Ikitursa is Finnish and Draugur is Nordic.
---
Tech 2 trig ships are produced by empires, try and guess which is which
---
Well that's a fucking start but not where they needed to hit.
---
It's quite a bummer on everyone who makes isk from abyssal sites outside of HS. I have never understood why they removed the suspect timer in HS ...
---
No, general incompetence and people like you
---
the hac also doesn't really have significantly less mass than the drek which would be the main reason to switch, and it'll probably cost a gorillion isk to boot
---
Only if you sold a skillbook before the patch and broke NDA
---
That’s how I read it. This is when we learn that trig ships are weak to mining lasers!
---
Imagine if they decide to blue eachother and unblue everyone else. That would be the start of something epic.

You can say that out loud:

Nah man, believe what you will. If it earns you money, thats great. Until I have seen it otherwise, I keep on my knowledge of the problems the whole IT companies all over the world have with recognizing and fighting bots...

Yeah, I'm trying to discourage that kind of bullshit from the krabs so we can have fun in eve again. Be the change you want to see. Form up a small gang to engage the stuff in your space, that kinda shit. I've been back a week and already have been. Not a lot of luck on fights yet, a lot of what's roaming our space is cap baiting and the whole point is to NOT drop supers.

Could be better you could be fulfilling your call and not trolling here? Get back to the work.
---
Id look into faction warfare and yes you can make good isk there both with missions and complexes. You will learn basics of pvp quickly. The npc corps are free to join and once you grew as a pilot you can make a better informed decision about what next. Wh space is rather empty and logistics are a pain. Go fly to huola see what ships are on sale and bring your fits in a inertia fit wreathe from amarr for example.

Nice work and many thanks. Is it possible to get a dark mode?
---
The only way you should measure distance is by souls saved brother.
---
The question is: what's the worth of "content" if it has no consequences?
---
Not really. We're using wxwidgets which replicate theme used by your OS. So you can get dark mode by changing style theme of your OS, if that's an option.
---
Do you really know what is amazing.  Being a good honest person that does not live life by lying  everyday in the digital space.

is it possible to add a "force update prices" button?

yes, no, maybe

Always. People will complain about this and that. But in general game is in a good place. Just wish they would figure out how to be more newbro friendly

I don't get it. He says "five years after the end of my CSM term". Wouldn't someone who's term ended in 2009 or 2010 already be able to talk about it?
---
Not at that measly price, think bigger
---
My point is they can't help themselves and WILL continue to escalate and trade up in terms of output, they will hit a hard wall of NOPE called PLEX prices.
---
well wormhole does it - few people want to grind structures but baiting, killing and looting things is usually enough to drive people to form. 
---
and i mean, right now nullsec also forms up to fight without the incentive to loot the assets so, i guess there has to be something more than that
---
Good luck not getting banned

Wait until it's out of alpha

Wait. Botting got you back into Eve?

Niedawno mialem sen. Widzialem jak Gwiezdna Pani rozmawia z Rudym w jakims pokoju i zaczyna podnosic glos na niego. Ten cos sie tlumaczyl ale wtedy Ona jeszcze bardziej podnosila glos wiec On tylko schylal glowe i pokornie sluchal. Takiej twarzy Gwiezdnej Pani to jeszcze nie widzialem nigdy. Kipiala z gniewu. Pomimo tego, ze rozmawiali po tubylczemu to cos tam rozumialem. Ze Ona ma w dupie jego, znaczy sie Rudego, kody, mechanizmy i reguly i jak czegos tam nie zrobi to bedzie mial z nia do czynienia. I taka wkurwiona wyszla i trzasnela drzwiami a smutny Rudy zostal sam w pokoju. Wtedy nagle nad moim skafandrem zobaczylem niewielki statek kosmiczny z ktorego przez sluze wylonilo sie kilku astronautow. W sluchawkach nagle ucichli murzyni i uslyszalem: "w koncu cie znalezlismy, chwyc sie liny, wyciagniemy cie  z tej gry." Ledwo zdolalem sie jej zlapac... a serce walilo mi looo jeju...a tu nagle... jebany budzik do pracy.... kurwa mac.

I'm not gonna lie /u/cactusjack48 would love this as well!!!
---
I don't know, can you repeat the question?
---
/u/cactusjack48 all hot news should be forwarded directly too /u/cactusjack48 for discrimination.

To be fair, mutaplasmid are mostly used for super blingy fit and it's not like everyone though they were going to be.
---
What in the meaning of the word "FEW" is unclear to you ?
---
incursion is good choice as the requirement is almost the same to l4

So this is amazing. Thank you now the sultan of the modules himself/herself will be able to mastermind all da gifs. /u/cactusjack48 your powers have become fully actualized my brother!!!

Ask /u/cactusjack48 he is the true CSM deep state.
---
Naw....I'm peak autism ask /u/cactusjack48
---
So this looks likes it makes stealth bombers less able to launch as many effective bombs...?
---
Maybe not, you can never trust the internet however, with the correct incentives to act 'honestly' it may well work and be an improvement over the current state of play.
---
All I know is he sounds like Josh Lyman from The West Wing.
---
I would like to direct you to the actual hero of the moon ore controversy.  The future CSM deep state candidate, the real slim shady /u/cactusjack48
---
Some call him a myth, some a monster.  I just call him all powerfull!!!!
---
I'm pretty sure CCP could have reworked FW, LS, and NPC NS with all the time wasted on trying to make something out of the agency.
---
Kinda looks like it'll take the 'mothership' role inherited from Sansha incursions. If so, this would point in the direction of eventual capsuleer ownership, similar to the Revenant.
---
He was on CSM 8, 2013-14.
---
Where do I find Wormhole Gas huffing? Encounters, Exploration, or Resource Harvesting?
---
The ironic thing is that you're being the selfish gate keeping jerk in this situation. Keep up this whole "if you're not l33t hardcore you shouldn't play" and I bet you in a couple years you'll get your dream of a game just for you. Chasing people out of a player driven sandbox is like chopping the branch you're standing on. Pretty soon there will not be enough players and the game will die.

---
No SOE hulls either... but hey, can snatch some glam boosters cheap
---
Are they working with CCP? Or is this a wish list from them?
---
Who cares.?
---
This belongs under the “stupid questions” thread. Honestly anyone reposting these “dumb cute newbie” threads should be banned.
---
My point is that someone from an earlier CSM was around when the trailer was made, so they probably know what that's about, right?
---
I doubt it, The Agency is just a pretty menu from what i can tell. 
---
Not exactly heavy on dev resources.
---
So basicly it's a bit different game? Watched some streams and was so confused.. might stay away and cherish my memories from early alphas up until FW times.
---
If you look at it, it became even worse. No idea how they achieved that, but they did it.
---
So be careful what you wish for if you want them to rework FW, LS, and NPC NS ;)
---
In case anyone at CCP is reading this: If you create a user interface put some users in front of it and see how they interact with it. Then notice that this interface isn't good.
---
Yes it's a pretty important part of rework and roadmap CCP is presenting us for something like 2 or 3 years.
---
Can you explain more what you mean about "sosiopathic players"? I'm wondering how the economic incentives would influence that kind of behavior. Maybe it could've been used as an escrow in-game for transactions between players as well. That'd be interesting for sure. 
---
I mean, if the behavior of bots in game are simplistic, it should be very easy for jurors to vote correctly. Removing bots should be a good thing, and making it easy for jurors to decide is good!
---
personally as someone that fuels structures - I am all for caps being banned from taking JBs.
---
They did a good job at reworking HS war decks, so there is hope. Especially for stuff players can give proper advice and gather feedback about like it happened for HS, rather than UI stuff which is a lot harder.
---
Why do you need that, what's the use-case?
---
Currently, prices are updated using following set of policies:
---
1) Normally price for an expires in 24h and next time you open fit with this item, it is updated
---
2) When you're using "optimize fit price" feature, all prices which are older than 2 hours are re-fetched
---
If that's still not enough, you can drop price cache altogether in Preferences &gt; Database &gt; Delete All Prices.
---
Dunno. It's on SISI so try it yourself. I can't find gas huffing in there. But I don't even know why I should search for it there. But at the same time I don't know why "Planetary Production" should be there.
---
Sure, but it feels like a cheap way to try and get people to run abyssal sites while throwing caution to the wind. Limiting stuff by price/availability doesn't work that well in the long run (see titans, rorquals and where we are today).
---
Mining has little to do with citadels, most of the materials come from planets. And not defending citadels has more to do with them being spammed everywhere and the colossal chore that is actually attacking and taking one down.

[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bh8e6c/weekly_reve_no_question_is_stupid_thread_april_25/) is last week’s thread.

By fiercely kicking any group that proves to bot - you lower the pool of possible renters, increase turnover which leaves more systems unrented for a higher % of the time and likely forcing some systems to be rented at lower rates.

Where did you learn English? Retard school? Lmao

Both the AF and HAC will have 100% EM shield resists? Am I reading that wrong?

GOAL POST!
---
They clearly stated that they wanted to be conservative about mutaplasmid and so far that's what have been happening. A big part of the market for ridiculous modules (the AT) is gone, and the adding of DCU/ADC mutaplasmid isn't going to make more people run abyssal sites, the vast increase in price that could come from a big production of the T2 ships would. And there is nothing wrong with trying to get more people into abyssal site which is afaik the least shitty PvE this game has to offer.
---
It's only for DC's and ADC's. You can't stack a load of them. It'll be fine.
---
Did you build your own furnace or buy one? I ordered one from devil forge and it’s pretty good
---
so one more thing, given the pov posted further down this doesn't add up all that well really:
---
&gt;  While Triumvirate was unsuccessful at the start, after a few attempts it managed to volley a Guardain. From there, the Snuffed Out logistics wing collapsed as the Loki fleet pretty much decimated it. Snuffed Out reacted by jumping in a couple of Apostles and a HAW dreadnought.
---
the first guardian kill was at 20:43, the first apostle and haw dread both were dropped at 20:41. Just second apostle was dropped once all 3 guards died.
---
On final timers sadly true, but its always the other side ... ;-) ....
---
LOL
---
Are you implying it's hard to get into any Imperium alliance???????
---
This keeps getting dumber and dumber the more I read about it.
---
If you want to make this 'official' I'll keep it posted on the sidebar or stickied with the time and date.

It is a double damage bonus. I think it's fair that you have to wait for it to fully spool to get it.
---
I can't think of any HACs that get bonuses that big.
---
Abyssal tank mods going to make titan/super fittings even more insane though. Not sure I like the idea of damage controls being enchanted. ADC's at least can only be fit on a couple hulls.
---

---
swap your resists to match the mission that should help a lot. Also see what the reports say are the trigger ships and avoid them till it's the last on grid
---
Watch them finally set one up, but it ends up being permanently deactivated and inoperable.
---
That looks pretty. Might actually use it now
---
how can is ee what "type" of dmg are they Doing? is there anywher eing ame i can see that ? or i need to Fidn a Chart Referign to the Difrent "pirate" factions dmg?
---
So your saying it'll cut down on citidel spam. I dont see a down side.
---
I gotta keep it simple or else you’ll sperg out with the “actually I got a engineering degree (with 2.0 gpa) so I’m actually smart”
---
Give us your fit then?
---
That was my bad, for some reason I typed SoE instead of SoCT - didn't even notice when we were copy editing.
---
It's now been updated to reflect SoCT hulls.
---
Use a chart to find that damage. I'm not sure if it can be found in game. It also is covered on that website when you click on the mission
---
Are you new to this game (like, 3 years or less) or just plain retarded?
---
Each side thetered on a upwell structure, insults and sperg flying like bullets in local for a while then each party flew home and called it a night.
---
No, Asset safety is fine.  Living out of Pos's or exclusively out of NPC stations in Null was awful.  I like the asset safety mechanic as it allows you to actually live out in Null much easier ( You can go afk and not worry too much about losing all your stuff when you come back).
---
When you create witch hunts like this it typically results in the burning of non-witches.
---
Is there a tab in the overview that shows what class a player ship is? (Frigate/Des/Cruiser)  
---
Or aside from remembering every name of the ships. I just need to start associating that more quickly to pick good fights.

Or you can "show info" people in Jita-local. You'll definitely come across some dork, who wrote it down in their bio. :P

probably NC.   
---
PL might have more large toys,  but numbers prove more decisive in the current meta.  specially when large toys arent much use vs subcaps
---
Not really. As part of the change, we'd likely be able to receive a concession in the form of separation of tethering and docking rights. With tethering allowed, but not docking, we can still spam the everloving fuck out of structures, while simultaneously insulating the line against risk of asset loss.

what the UI looks like at the moment for Agency on SISI
---
Yeah things have changed, The Imperium was  in the North and now it is in the South and ONLY God can defeat it :D, the rest of the map don't matter that much....
---
They don't bring different things to the table though.  That is what is so laughable.  Neither group can function without their Super fleets.
---
*attends funeral*
---
Which is why having a public market is dumb.  Stage out of something with an ACL and a closed market.
---
Oh god. CCPlease put escalations back into the journal, I don't want to click every time through a bunch of categories when I want to run one, the usability of the agency for specific activities is already utterly crap in its current form.
---
I reccomend training both on one char because you can fit ships like the astero to fight and hunt while doing exploration.
---
Did you add the 600b missing because komodo wasn't valued correctly by zkill? :)
---
Thank you for putting this up!
---
NPC NS is one of the few areas in the game that is fine and CCP shouldn't touch it with a 20 foot pole.
---
that's a long time to break even on dps. is its projection/application better at least?
---
Exploration does not take long to skill to, no need for 2nd char just for that. 
---
Personally, i would wait a while, train the first guy properly (explo skills to level 3 are enough) and then you will have more solid ground to build on. 
---
Pro-tip: WH Exploration without cloak is pointless... Even if you find anything, the chances of you getting back with the loot are pretty slim. 
---
We are just random names on reddit after all, our advice may be worth less than nothing.
---
&gt;  So what do you guy's recommend, making 2 characters 1 combat professional and 1 exploration or just have one and training all the required skills?
---
I would recommend training both skill set on one character. Scanning skills don't take long to train to a decent level and are always worth having on your main character.
---
&gt; I am Omega but noticed I still would have to pay to train on multiple characters; is this to discourage the making of Alts?
---
Well somewhat yes, but it's more due to CCP making money than really discouraging people from making alts. BTW, if you want to keep training a second character into more than doing a specific task, you should consider making it on another account rather than on the same, so that you can play both characters at the same time (aka dualboxing)
---
Come join us in the Imperium where NONE will disturbe you or hinder your dreams other than yourself, you can join any alliance within the Imperium and still be able to move or live whereever you want in the space which the Imperium owns.
---
Good luck
---
MAKE THE JOURNAL GREAT AGAIN
---
And what about tank / speed ?
---
Nice. That's like a month off my queue.
---
damavik nerf, are you fucking kidding me? it should just get the armour bonus for free and it'd probably still suck monkey fuck
---
You normally dont need/use a damage control for missions. 2 specific resist hardeners for the npcs youre fighting and maybe an energized adaptive if you really want to be safe, single armor rep plus nano pumps for rigs.
---
Dont use buffer (plates) or trimark rigs for missions. You want the best active tank, buffer is only good if you have logi. Focus on active tanking, then you wont need to warp out.
---
Abaddon is pretty cap intensive though.
---
Maybe this was the long awaited apology for racism and homophobia we were waiting for.  
---
We all know Elo and Noraus are secretly asian lovers.....  
---
PGL is just there to fap over important people and suck up as one would expect.
---
If your PC lags because of 100 drones on a gate stop then I'd suggest you stop using a toaster to play eve.
---
no, neither is having a job or a girlfriend
---
As much as I like this style of enforcement in League of Legends, I don't know if the eve player base can be trusted with it.
---
* Limit the size of the fuel-bay of structures.
---
* 'Low power mode' lasts a week or so, depending on the rigs/modules online.
---
* Introduce 'No Power Mode' - no tether, no docking, structure can be hacked to gain \*\*OWNERSHIP\*\*
---
They could also play around with limiting tether for some structures - i.e.  Raitarus aren't a military-grade thing, so tether goes offline if it's in structure.
---
Iki gets a tracking bonus, 5% per level like the Vedmak, but no range bonus.
---
https://i.imgur.com/gilWmZe.png
---
exactly, show some lowsec ♥♥♥, a small QOL change
---
Considering that Brisc Rubal was just recently falsely accused for breaching NDA and wrongly punished, no. This has no place anywhere near EVE. If it has the potential to screw people over it will definitely be used maliciously. Not to mention the timing of the suggestion is horrible.
---
I flew a Paladin for a while but an Apoc should work the same: just get Lasers to 100KM Range and Fit a MJD, minimal tank and fit the rest with Damage/Range/Tracking Modules.
---
Jumping to 100KM to avoid facetanking the low Range BS's frees up a lot of Tank Modules for more Damage. Always work from small to Large Ships unless some smaller ships are triggers and you want to avoid more incoming damage by clearing out more of the current wave first. If you kill Battleships and struggle with incoming Damage watch for the red circles around the Ships and kill the once with more visible circles first.
---
If they are anything like the items given away at past events they will have descriptions explaining the events they are linked to.
---
I cant believe it does get a range bonus.  
---
Every other hac in the game gets a range bonus of some form.
---
so it doesnt give you any items?
---
Yes, please do this

---
why do people do this? like relax and just about the incident instead of injecting your own issues onto unrelated things, thanks.
---
=(
---
You will get an item that will go into your hangar that will have a description describing the event.
---
Globby was eviscerated by the ccp care bear loving menace
---
Triglavinan arc jumps to a random keepstar: "nothing personal kids, just deleting some space junk".
---
I don't blame CCP for not wanting to discriminate against customers just because they don't have high end PCs. But client lag isn't the only lag, you can cause slow grid loading due to server side lag as well.
---
But that aside imagine being so shit at gate camping you need to cause undue lag to catch people.
---
I'd think this would be the perfect moment then? This way both parties of the dispute would have the possibility to provide evidence for their cause. Not sure how the process was with Brisc.
---
Heh my bad, didnt even think about it, just followed what Triglavians were using so far. So Tech 2 Triglavian ships will be Empire made ! Interesting !
---
The fact is, people who have bot accounts are players. All of these alts are considered players. It's very likely to get rigged juries. There's also the fact that sociopathic politics have come out of game before, with doxxing and other out of game attacks. A vector for an alliance to brigade someone and get them banned??
---
You better believe they'll abuse that.
---
I've never understood why their planning goes the way it does, that game health is such a low priority.
---
I'm knocking you down from #3 Missourian to #4 for this.
---
Yes, I extracted the font from zkillboard and just used dev console :)
---
Don’t listen to people saying to do it on one character. It is true that explo doesn’t take a lot of skill points BUT it still takes a couple months of selective training to get to a cov ops frig with t2 mods and solid scanning skills. All these skills are useless in combat. Exploration is one of the rare things in eve where usual core skills don’t matter. So here is how you do it: use your current omega account to skill into exploration because it can use cloak. Create a separate free alpha account (make it through your own referrer link so you instantly get 750k free skill points on it) and start training and using it for combat. You can have the two in completely different corps like your explorer in signal cartel and your combat alpha in horde or some low sec faction warfare corp. when your main can fly a solid cov ops explo frig with t2 analysers you can start training general core skills on it and later combat skills as well.
---
Would you mind showing the typical fits?
---
~thatsthejoke~
---
SOE Fax plz. Just for the cool hull
---
Yep. And my solution gives you a similar ISK pay-out as you would have through fire-sale and you get a chance of some of your items being safetied to low.
---
Just make it go awaaaayyyyyy!
---
SO much this.
---
Just train on one character for now. 
---
The scanning skills dont take too long and theres loads of other skills you; dhave to train on both accounts.
---
UI is important for new comers, but the agency is neither efficient nor good for eve.
---
"Alts" in Eve, means having several accounts. There is almost no reason for each account to have 3 character slots, since you can only play one at a time, and only train one at a time, unless you pay extra each month for several.
---
Otherwise, the players with alts... such as a Capital ship pilot and a Cyno alt (required for scouting ahead, and for activating the beacon used for Cap ship jump engines) means having 2 Omega accounts going at the same time.
---
So if you want to dabble in combat and exploration, you're better off just making a single character that can do all those things. My main character can do just about everything, so I don't need to log in and out, or stop training queues so I can train others instead.
---
Just had to watch PL pings and login if they pinged.
---
My point was more that mining created far too much ISK so alliances don't find losing a citadel as a big deal. Same with pilots and asset safety taxes.
---
What I'd think of doing in NPC NS is making it a little more worthwhile to live there, and a bit more accessible. Probably a few region gates here and there to make logistics reasonable. You're right that it's not bad, but running pirate L4s is definitely more dangerous than sovnull krabbing and should probably be better rewarded.
---
Plus it might pull down the price of fun pirate faction ships a little, which wouldn't hurt.
---
I just don't think it's a typical fleet HAC, it's there to brawl, not project.
---
Think Vagabond/Deimos instead of Muninn/Eagle. 
---
Also, all other races have 2 HACs, maybe another will come along at some point.
---
Trying to boost progod out of iron.
---
PL doesnt rent space, PL is the landlord that rents out space
---
Who is Brisc's favourite enforcer of the law?
---
You didnt say “any imperium alliance”
---
Well, They came very close about a year or two ago.
---
The vaga and deimos both have range bonuses.  
---
This is not a "role thing" but a standard staple of all hacs.  they all get range bonuses.
---
I think the GOP and current Republican philosophy in the US political system is everything but what Republican party stood for and is a toxic wasteland of corruption and exploitation (hurr hurr but the Dems! ...yeah but they aren’t nearly as bad so fuck off). **With that said** he did catch a boatload worth of shit from people just due to the fact he was an R.
---
for multiple reasons   
---
1) you cant punish people going afk   
---
2) when there were stations you could jc in and out (and try fireselling) without caring about standings     
---
3) it is a unique mechanic for wormholes, if we want to invert it lets make wormholes hold an infinite mass as well and we will see which place will be the real pinata
---
U R Guard... :O
---
&gt;even if your ship survives!
---
Hypothetical, right?
---
The only relevant parts for this were the number of heatsinks. 
---
Dreka can reasonably fit 3, but the peculiar [T2 Resist Profile](https://i.imgur.com/eIaWPh1.png) of the Iki makes it hard to fit more than 2.
---
I'm actually happy with this ui.  I can see where people are going to complain about it, and it may be lipstick on a pig but I like the lipstick.

I'm assuming it's going to be the mothership you have to destroy to end the incursion. Here's hoping it has a fucking amazing superweap9n.

Haha, yea so it seems.

Correct

What does this a accomplish other than allowing a broken system to affect wider swaths of the game?

thanks
---
I'm more worried about game design / UI design time tbh.
---
They took in some corps to bolster their numbers that shadoo wouldn't even have bothered to take a look at, after they lost a few very veteran corps and players (and they still seem very mad about that considering local sperg).
---
yes yes cause egbinger skarkon konora etc are such safe places to undock A TITAN from a station, you wont get snuff/rekking crew/ivana in the first 2 miliseconds you undock on top of you

Typically I would agree with you 100%.
---
But not for this word.
---
This is not ‘a word in another language that I don’t know’.
---
‘Reddit’ is a word in no language I have ever heard of [somebody will point out that it is and we just never happened to have heard about it].
---
Reddit is NOT an English word. Reddit is a play on words, it’s not a word in the vocabulary [it will be now because of how popular the site is].
---
On top of that, anyone who comes here with any regularity has seen this word, of any words here, a million times easily. I see 10 instances of it in this screen alone.
---
Of all the words to get wrong, it’s the one word you have to spell right to get to this place.
---
For almost any other word I’d agree with you 100%, because I really don’t need to win an argument on the internet, but this word, of all words... come on.
---
As you can see "the other side" already downvoted me, while being the one that first brought up that point. The narratives are strong within these guys
---
They are good at what they set out to be.
---
Free to play is definitely an option and can be fun. As always look for a corp that is alpha (F2P) friendly and that will help you experience a lot
---
Yea, it escalated quickly i guess...
---
A hybrid falloff bonus is hardly a range bonus.
---
Never has a HAC been able to reach the kind of damage we're looking at here either, pushing 1500 dps without drugs/heat/implants or using the 50Mbit drone bay, and that's with T2 rad sinks.
---
Not really, no. F2P feels like a trial demo mode. You can do a little bit of a lot of things. But as soon as you try to dig into any of them, you realize you need to pay for Omega status to continue.
---
Only you will know if it's worth it to you once you've begun.
---
I'd say the first couple of months aside from the slower training there isn't much difference. The difference does become apparent later on though.
---
holy shit way to miss the point you mouthbreather
---
&gt; Brian was eviscerated by the media for being a Republican politician 
---
Were people actually shitting on him because he's a Republican? I'd seen a bunch of mentions that he received hate because of it, but didn't see any of it. There was opinions shared because of him being a lobbyist regardless of party.
---
Most of what I'd seen was because of his CSM capabilities, and general persona.
---
Omega can get in total 1,25mil SP, alpha much less (25-50k?). There are many other items tho, skins (permaband rokh lol), ships (gnosis, praxis...) and other stuff like clothes, fireworks etc
---
"The Imperium" didn't even exist 5 years ago.
---
It's very worth while to live there as a small entity and not a thousand-man alliance. The individual income is pretty damn good.
---
As for danger in running pirate L4s, it's really a matter of how much of a presence you have in your little pocket. Take Curse for example - Fraternity has some corps in their ancestral home of OSY running the Serpentis burners freely because they have a relatively big presence in that constellation (It's about 50-60 characters at any given time, iirc). You can gatecamp them for a bit before dozens of dudes come at you, and they almost always have friendlies on the OSY- station undock in Nadoes ready. They also kill any hostile citadel near them too.
---
You speak for itself. LM makes the best eve videos
---
It's not just skills, it's also location. If you do combat or pve in system A and then you want to do hacking in null sec then you have to travel there and if you then decide that you want to chill with combat or your corp asks something else of you then you have to fly back again.
---
If you have 2 chars you can use one for pve/combat where you want it or where it suits your corp, and then have a second character roam around doing exploration. And you simply log in the char who's play style you want to do at that moment.
---

Even better when random structures start going missing in botter space and they don't realize it until like half their assets are gone.

This means that npc null and its income will be under the influence of sov null groups if they just enlist.

F2P is a good way to understand whether you like the game or not, however, due to its restrictions, F2P is nowhere as enjoyable as the paid version. 
---
Also if you have enough time to spare you can still farm isk to pay for the monthly subscription.
---
I mean they are a improvement over their T1 variants. I really tried to use the damavik and vedmak, but as much I like the idea of them, they just don't work in reality. That's why I look forward trying the T2 variants, esp because I like AFs and HACs in general.
---
Heh, people think they can hide this with downvotes.
---
haha lol didnt even saw that mistake. I thought you are judging about some mistakes like dont or don't your and you'r :D
---
i have to admit you are right on this case too ;)

You're not wrong...

Huh. Thanks for the heads up on Frat being down there, that sounds like a group I could actually kick a few times and get to form up. I'll take dozens of dudes over a boson any day.
---
Brian was chainsawed for using his "credentials AS a politician" for explaining why this couldnt possibly be true.  
---
That is the heart of the issue for me.
---
Once again with misunderstandings, mining does not create isk, it creates minerals which are traded for isk, so you could say mining helps circulate isk. And even remove it through market and contract fees. The astronomical amounts of isk in alliance wallets come mainly from ratting taxes and service fees.
---
"Even in ‘EVE: Online’ Republican Politicians Are Corrupt" the title of the Geek article.
---
Not like we didn't know this from a certain other MMO with lewd maid costumes...
---
Indeed, but if those incursions happen in highsec, it will just prevent Orca to mine, which isn’t a big deal since the boosting power is untouched...
---
Lowsec rarely see Rorqual mining, and nullsec is a bit like Highsec : Rorqual can still be used for boosting.

Train explo on your main. Secondary chars on the same account should only have passive utility skills, especially ones that want a different attribute map, like trade skills, industry skills, PI, etc.

The Ikit and the Nergal were designed to brawl without the possibility of a 1v1 stalemate.  This has been a thing for a long time in Eve (ships in the same class being able to tank each other trivially with enough investment), but wasn't really in the spotlight until Abyssal pvp.  CCP was forced to confront this particular gameplay degeneracy, and was probably in the front of their minds when they designed the Triglavian T2 line.

We had the map upside down

&gt;Brian was chainsawed for using his "credentials AS a politician"

It was more of a "being accused of breaking a corporate NDA harshly effects my current life so why would I risk doing it."

Look at what a shield kikimora can do. Now think about the Draugur and what it could be able to do.

Factions make no difference, it's just the aesthetics of some of the characters and background story. Pick the race you like most, it has no impact on flying ships you want in the long run.

From what little we got from CCP, other csm members(read EVE players) accused Brisc of providing info on future dev plans to his alliance INIT, with leadership allegedly exploiting the leaks to gain an unfair advantage. We assume some form of false proof was provided(though that's not certain) and after a hasty investigation Brisc and a couple other INIT leaders got banned. Then CCP went back and reinvestigated the case only to come out and say "hey, sorry we banned you, there wasn't enough evidence after all" and retracted all previous actions. Essentially CCP got played by the rest of the CSM. 
---
Now imagine the average eve player, being provided with evidence we have no way of knowing isn't modified by the accuser, getting a say as to whether some random dude gets to keep playing the game. Either the moderators take whatever decision we come up with and enforce it, with tons of people getting banned because they are in x alliance("anyone who lives in dtonelands is botting" etc), or they still get swamped with cases to review. So either a system like this changes nothing or, worst case scenario, it allows people to manipulate the system to harm other players.
---
Or, something else I thought of while writing. What's stopping an actual botter, or a simple douchebag, from cluttering the system with thousands of false cases, reporting every random Joe shmo for shits and giggles? There's just too many loopholes, especially if you consider that EVE was always about exploiting the loopholes to gain an edge.
---
If you're USTZ you also have Naked Oiled Bodybuilders and The Wraithguard around.

So what. It's a consistent feature of all hacs; range bonuses.  
---
The falloff bonus is part of the reason a rail demois is good. It is 100% a valid and useful bonus. 
---
I'm complaining about CCP's inability to stay consistent.    
---
I am disappointed, as i had expected them to follow their hull bonus convention and was expecting a slow vedmak with more range.
---
Instead we have a slower vedmak with the same range/application as a regular vedmak; one less rig slot, and the same starting dps.    waiting 3.5 minutes to reach marginally more dps than the existing vedmak isn't much of an advantage.   
---
This thing is looking really unimpressive   inb4 everyone just runs 100mn on it so it doesnt get held down and fucked like the slow child it is.

I'm not terribly concerned about the spamming of structures, so much as I am about the spamming of *low power* structures. If you can afford to spam high power structures and fuel them, more power to you. I don't see an immediate problem with separating docking and tethering rights, and I would tentatively be fine with that + removing asset safety + removing a reinforcement timer from lower power structures.

---
No rose colored glasses here.  I'm not wishing to return to old Eve, upgrade my clone on death, live out of a POS, etc.  I appreciate the changes that took away tedium which had no real benefits.  What I am saying is that part of the appeal of this game is to put what you have on the line.  Others may enjoy the game differently than I do, but what I enjoy in this game is feeling the thrill of risk and executing my plans in game.  This game sucks in terms of balanced competitive experience, pve, finding good content, etc.  It's great in making stories that are meaningful to the parties involved.  So when people don't really give a fuck that they're going to lose a station they've parked a supercarrier or whatever in... why are they even playing?  Just mining to build their little dragon hoard out in null, and they'd quit the game if they lost it?  It's a playstyle that seems like a trap that keeps people tunnel visioned on shitty pve activities and not experiencing what the game can really offer, and it seems like a consequence of asset safety to me.

---
Returning to Eve after 4 years and been doing some of my first mining in eve after 14 years playing.
---
It became very apparent quickly how broken the Devs have made the Rorqual. It used to have a role compressing ORE and running 'endgame' mining support boosts. It was very niche and the risk vs reward was generally not worth it for 98% of players. It did need improving but now its just endgame mining full stop. Its bonkers overpowered.
---
The 200km targetting range with fairly low scan res and like 10+ targets with normal skills is bizarre - combined with heavy neuts and a capital tank makes them pretty much invulnerable except to huge blob fleet or capitals... Roruals effectiveness multiplies with more of them due to RR, more DPS, more neuts etc meaning 2 or 3 can hold their own vs 10 BS easily. You can then refit with a mobile depot to WCS to evade any remaining tackle - but then there's also get out of jail free PANIC button if they do get into real trouble... Requiring a Cap fleet now to kill a mining fleet (at least in lowsec) is just dumb.
---
Getting to mining - the yield is ridiculously good (3 times a Hulk I mean WTF?!?! why ever fly a barge?) , even after the excavator nerf - the yield combined with the 300k Ore hold means it does not even need mining support like industrials. With RR bonuses too Just field more rorquals, who even needs mining boosts.
---
It is one of my biggest shocks returning to the game to see just how broken CCP have made these ships - my guess is the CSM nullsec lobby wanted easy safe mining and that is exactly what they have got. Now if only they had better refine rates, more efficient production in nullsec and safety for their blueprints too Null people could compete at industry almost as well as the rest of Eve.... \*sarcasm overload sorry\*.
---
Stupid cow-towing game designers (Fozzie) and stupid player CSM lobbies are making the game so unbalanced with idiotic ideas like these that are basically handing Eve industry to Goonswarm/the rest off nullsec and expecting people to still want to do it. The parity between High/Low/Null is being wrecked such these changes and I'm just sad and disappointed CCP are not even apparently aware they are the primary cause of it.
---
It seems like you are asking if you will get any actual loot that is worth something from those items. The answer is no; they are just lore items like a journal entry from a "traditional" mmo.
---
No eve is politics
---
Wtf. Stop being helpful. This is reddit
---
Look on the bright side: the next hac without range bonuses will have a precedent; this one!
---
:'( Why must you hurt me?
---
Pretty sure he flies with Elo.
---
it's got more staying power than the vedmak to ramp up to that dps. I agree with the range bonus though, wtf ccp.

&gt; watch for the red circles around the Ships and kill the once with more visible circles first.
---
Wait what? Is this a thing?
---
Seriously, when are we going to get some representation from nullsec carebears who don’t understand how the game works?

Well, that answers the question on what the Triglavians plan to do with the World Ark Xordazh.

Assign each member to one of three teams using a RNG.  Team 1 shoots NC., team 2 shoots PL, team 3 shoots teams 1&amp;2 and claims victory.

Why spend time/$ on 2 accts when 1 can do both. A good explorer will have to be good at combat whether ur doing WH sigs or competing with another explorer. T3s are about the only ships capable of maximizing both at the same time.

uhh, how did you calculate that? It should take 275 seconds to fully spool up (with an entirely empty fit and T2 gun)
---
Has it been five years since citadels? Would he know what that is?

Nergal Amarr, Ikitursa Caldari, and Draugur either Gallente or Minmatar?

Honestly have no fucking clue and it doesn’t help that I don’t know what any of these things are so I can’t see how they line up with the other names.
---
I'm curious if Brisc actually thinks this, or if its just OP wanting to play the conservative victim. Of the media articles linked above, one has an obvious political bias, but the other five are fine.   
---
His party affiliation was mentioned in almost all the media coverage I read about Brisc's campaign and election to the CSM.  Arguably party affiliation was irrelevant to those stories as well, but I have little doubt the coverage would have been any different if he were a Democrat.
---
It does have a range bonus...for Remote Armor repair.
---
Were you in Ares Protectiva at the time? If so, I do remember the battle to save that Titan. Good memories. With local exploding and capitals jumping in left and right it did look rather grim for a while. Definitely one of those never-say-die days.

I have fond memories of Ares Protectiva generally. You guys were (are?) a good crew and always conducted your operations with style.

lol because people put drones on gates for lag, clearly that is the purpose right? I'm not sure if your full of shit or just ignorant honestly.

Triglavian Ships are OP and tbh have no real competing the battlefield. CCP will have to add more ship types/races for the Meta to not be completely stale in a few months.
---
New rorq save meta
---
Sorry dude. One day people will stop bothering you for the jaw dropping story.
---
Yeah, this clearly isn't a ship for bloc-level fleet comps, or even at a small scale, really.  
---
I *can* see this being an exciting option for WH groups.  Both in traditional brawls on holes, and as excursion fleets to go after ratting carriers and supers you find in k-space.

Hi! It's currently finals season here at my university so I'm super busy for the next week and a half or so until I get done with finals and I move out of my apartment.

Is there anything you'd like to see in the rewrite that is not in the current version of Evernus? I'm currently planning to include a skill farming tool, LP Calculator and mayyyybe some reactions stuff.

Neato. They should revamp the Pirate FOB's if they are going to include them in this group though.

How's that koolaid tasting these days?

Going after caps is pretty much our staple content, and I'm not really seeing any big selling points for the HAC here that I'd want in any of our armor doctrines.
---
Please add a screenshot of the fits. Thank you.
---
messing with your weiner too much is known to make you blind.
---
I'm on mobile so can't do the calculation.... But the total damage done is the area under background each respective curve.
---
 So depsite the fact that one eventually reaches more DPS than the other.. you have to susustain that increased DPS for a given amount of time to break even before your total damage done is equal, the exceeding the weapon with initially higher DPS.
---
The time of break even damage would be when the area under the curves are equal. You could solve for this by creating 2 equations to describe each curve and seeking the hem equal to one another and solve for t, time. Maybe I will do it in a bit to verify .

No official reddit FC rank? I'm disappointed.
---
I approve of fostering the myth that we took no risk because everything was calculated and all eventualities forseen through some act of pixel mysticism that ensure final victory in the field.
---
In reality there were constant seat-of-pants moments because a) We favoured expensive brawling doctrines which required total commitment of expensive assets and b) most of the great fights in the 2009-12 era were on POS timers for jackpot moons where there was no secret that we'd be turning up. 
---
I think there's nothing quite like Eve adrenaline (maybe being the last squad member alive in Tarkov and tasked with securing everyone's loot, and pondering if the bodies are still being watched).
---
Of course not all doctrines were maximum risk - pipebombing, for example, was (if done correctly) virtually risk free for maximum impact. But it was also partly a statement doctrine to address the changing (virtual) world.

Second, afk does not equal bot.  While they very well could be bottom, afk ratting in a Vexor is not proof of that.  That said most alliances don't condone betting or bot-like behavior and will probably kick them.  Just keep complaining to different people until someone listens.
---
Do you have any examples you can remember? It's quite possible I did take someone which led to the deterioration of their alliance afterward, so I'm not necessarily disputing it could have happened - I'm just curious about the details.

I do remember recruiting Marillio and Crackhour which may have had implications for Huzzah's functioning thereafter. Definitely wasn't my intent o harm Huzzah with it though - great group, lots of fun.

The exploration skills transfer nicely into blops and combat scanning(bombers etc.). You won't need a second character, just train the pure exploration skills to III to start and make a nice astero pilot.
---
Yes you need to buy a MCT to train two characters on the same account. IMO its more bang for your buck just to make a whole second account that way both characters can be logged in at once.

Remember that the Zarmazd is empire made as well.

CCP increased the maximum spool limit, but didn't increase the increments in the spools so instead of 30 5% increases its not 60 5% increases (should be 30 10% increases)
---
Make alts. As many as you are willing to pay for. Eve is designed to be multiboxed by now. In the long run you want some scanning skills on the PvP character too I think.
---
At present we're sailing the seas nightly in a Type VII in Wolfpack and racing cars in Forza but as they say, never say never.
---
Also keep in mind that Serenity doesn't really affect or involve most of RnK; it's a window into a world that Fulcrum provided for me and a few others and in turn I provided others on here with a view. Daily Eve ops will depend on my ability to lure Eldareth off the conning tower.

/and I’m only saying it because I like the card and the idea behind it. I love just about any art expression of the EVE Online Reddit community. The propaganda quality is phenomenal. I want that art to shine. A typo like that, which is easily avoidable, for me takes away from that effort and it doesn’t have to. That’s the only reason for mentioning it.
---
So lemme get this straight... the game company banning 3 players for no reason other than a hunch is supposed to be attractive to potential new players...
---
Got it
---
Well, all my information is five years old and I don't kid myself by thinking I know anything all *that* important. But I accept that CCP has the right to ban me or anyone else, for any reason.
---
they would be dumb to, eve isn't really getting new players anymore so losing the ones it has due to perceived incompetence is probably bad?
---
Which is right around max ramp no?
---
Realistically speaking this is a worse ship to swap your primary than the T1 varients. A double ramp step would curb that and make it a viable boat to juggle targets.
---
what a mood tbh
---
name a good idea CCP has had in awhile? this is right on par with the track record they have set the last 2-3 years.
---
nergalnergalnergal
---
I had a look but, even running it with rapid deployment on top of one nano and a t2 poly, you're left with something that does less damage (understandably) but also goes a good bit slower compared to a kiki *without* links. 
---
For reference, throwing a single MWD on a Kiki gives me 2447, doing the same to the Draugur shows 1771. It's a pretty significant difference, ergo I can't see why I would take one over a Bifrost (which can go like the clappers, boosh, tackle, have an emergency injector and an extender). At least, not in a kiting gang with kiki's/ret's e.t.c
---
I agree the range should definitely be more than that. But in regards to DPS? Not necessarily something unfair here. Most Battle cruisers (not even attack versions) can come pretty close if not on par to their meta HAC counters.
---
Can you integrate this chart so we can see the total damage applied over time?
---
No, clearly not from the main post too.
---
Dreka hits full spool at a little over 100s (triple rad sink)
---
Iki hits full spool at around 210s (dual rad sink)
---
Damage dealt is equivalent at 316s.
---
https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/message/2362089/#post2362089
---
Can the Ikitursa even apply the same amount of damage in under four minutes? Looks to mee like the Drekavac is still coming out on top in total damage applied after 220 seconds.
---
I simulated that thing already on sisi, with 4 of these officer sinks and officer gun it can spool up to 3000dps with heat and drugs, if you use mutas on these radsinks, it even can get 3500 dps with 5 augmented hammers.
---
In legagy, so Yeah. Dumpster
---
I mean, maybe he does? It's easy to not give a shit when it isn't your account on the line I suppose.
---
I've just been roaming this space and can confirm that it's full of VNI bots.  I mean, the clue is in the name - Treasury / Coins.  Really, to turn a blind eye to this is a bit of a shocker. 
---
I wouldn't mind if you could at least kill them, but they are impossible to catch even with an assault frig. Effective bots...
---
Takes the p\*\*\* !
---
Which sites you've been running?
---
Last time I played years ago, my shield Corax was slower than my 1600 plate Thorax.
---
Now Yulai has become something to remember? CCP banned Zombies for that, by creating that item I read it as "it wasn't an hack, we banned them because we are assholes"
---
That room is unlocked isn’t it? You can just leave.
---
but ive killed so many of them already... how is there any left to invade....
---
Maybe
---
The biggest boost to mutaplasmid use would be to add roll info to killmails. Without that, they’ll never be allowable for SRP.
---
&gt;If we were to remove asset safety in 0.0, there will be very little incentive for many people to stick around
---
Because massive pussies. Wormholes are the only ones really playing eve.
---
&gt;losing assets is a bitch to experience, especially if it's in a timezone you may not be able to defend it
---
Again. Wormholers can lose everything especially in time zones they can't defend.
---
What game is null sec playing exactly. Where is the balls? It's like null sec is playing eve lite for pussies.
---
Yes, in fact, they do.
---
Is it only for Omega?
---
Normally Leshaks will spawn 100k+ away and  there is plenty of time for players to choose to leave without risking to take loots
---
From what he said this seems completely different
---
&gt;He is the fucking Mittani btw
---
ftfy
---
Td's, Neuts, Long range Jams (Kitsune, Blackbrid, Falcon)
---
you sound like you never played this game. why are you suggesting to add something like this to a game you never played?
---
Because this definitely won't be a train wreck like the current fw.
---
What are you missile skill are like

---
Holy shit, the remind me bot coming in for the win today. I completely forgot about this xD
---
Yeah, Trigs are strong, but they've got their counters, people need to relax.
---
my problem is when you use Warp Acelaration gate... you simply warp 0km...
---
Good God man did you learn nothing reading the bullshit the rest of us have been enduring since 2012?
---

---
You can make your ship unscannable by combat probes with an alpha really easy - cloaks are not required for wh fun and profit even with an alpha account
---
he's not wrong though
---
Is it feasible to plug the kin hole with a rig and still use 3 dmg lows?
---
If you live in a wormhole this is exactly what happens. Why are you such a pussy? No asset safety would make you less fat and lazy. 
---
Might make you think more and be smarter.
---
But I doubt it.
---
Who'me*
---
I think perhaps you are one of the stupidest people I've seen posting on reddit today.  And that's up against some pretty stiff competition (Olmeca was posting earlier).
---
Those Loki’s are cancer. Thanks for helping us find a new doctrine :P
---
Tell us more or riot
---
To clarify, those triangles beneath Invasion? Those transliterate as:
---
Chapter 1
---
Well look at that the "attention" whore is back.
---
I mean if you really want to you could skip the plate and ADC and quad sink it. 
---
But a realistic fleet fit for a short-range t2 armor ship with 2 rigs, 6 lows and no resist bonus is dual damage mod.
---
I made release before they were deployed, no bueno! Updating to include them now.
---
I legit just went to the EVE website to see if this was on there.
---
It should be.
---
Ikitursa is definitely Caldari since the Caldari names are a weird mix of Finnish and Japanese(?) and Ikitursa is a bastardized version of Iku-Turso, a mythical monster in the Finnish folk lore.
---
Minmatar ship names are usually based on Norse/Nordic myths and lore, so I'd imagine the Draugur (undead in the Norse mythology) is Minmatar related.
---
Nergal is an old Babylonian god so I'd wager it's Gallente as a lot of Gallente ships are named after old gods (Erebus, Nyx). Amarr ships are named after general religious concepts instead of characters.
---
They are cool with us. The rest of new eden are planet-dwelling krabs tho.
---
&gt;If we played as much as we shitposted, we might enjoy the game again
---
or realize why we stopped
---
I was thinking it would be faster to get on a target if you had to walk a few jumps, but that's probably a little too edge case.
---
Then don't do it. If it's a chore then it's not worth it. The gifts are not going to be game-changers.
---
The only reason new players are hard to attract is that the new player onboarding experience is still complete shit. I *just* came back to the game and am *actively* bringing in three new people and, less than a week in, they're already drifting back out.
---
The new player experience is **boring.** Hideously so.
---
There's still time to redeem yourself and gib a SoE cloaky Battlecruiser :(
---
Well it depends on what you want from this game
---
A mining simulator placed at background while you are doing other stuff?
---
Accumulate enough isk so you could afford the shinny toys on market?
---
Playing mind games with probably the most risk-averse players in video game history?

I'm a slow learner :(

The hell there isn't. Go shoot engineering complexes and reactor-fit refineries. Those have partial asset safety on TQ right now.

This is the same exact post in which the comment has been screenshotted from. Look at the top comment.

It's honestly the best way to lean into pvp
---
I already have to deal with these ramblings irl, dont bring it into eve too
---
yeah unless you spawn with all webs and neuts lol
---
You're a bad unintegrated spy.
---
&gt; CCP is adding a "board corvette" button to receive free noobships in citadels (?)
---
Do you still get a free noobship when you dock in a pod? This may replace that, so you don't leave Corvettes scattered across the cluster.
---
ohh shit yeah, lol fuck :D
---
Holy shit are you stupid.
---
Yes, in a bid to increase revenue by gaining media exposure, CCP knowingly committed libel, therefore opening themselves up to both criminal prosecution and civil forfeiture, and against a fucking lawyer to boot.
---
You are really really really really smart with a bright shining future in marketing.
---
But hopefully the story is worth it!! Only 10 more days
---
Just fuck up our empires, fam, bomb capsuleers back to the stone age.
---
No, this is Patrick.
---
In mega fleets sure. But in small gang you start to loose the DPS to break them by bringing more support. And you need more and more logi to stay in grid with them. It's a hard balance
---
Not all heroes wear capes. Thank you for this breakdown.
---
Might want to run a Micro Jump Drive
---
thank you sir
---
Just a hint because I did not realize this for probably 4 months or something.
---
The faction you do missions for, fly that factions ships for said combat missions.
---
I was doing Caldari L3's in an Apocalypse and was surprised when L4's were basically impossible.
---
So if you run missions in Caldari space for example, a Raven would be a fine choice, as an example.
---
the only thing i could show is just them all closeby.
---
aint gonna dox myself thats spoopy
---
Well since crystalline isogen prices dropped again, time to buy another 100k, this will make me some big iskies
---
And honestly, stuff like faction warfare could be great at retaining players...with a bit of work done to it.

Well Shit...
---
Because boosh ravens are such a viable and versatile fleet doctrine? H-5 happened because NCPL wasn't really prepared for booshing ravens, and didn't  have a method for countering them available during the battle. Now try pitting them against feroxes. Or munnins. Sure they can escape but can they kill the other fleet? Current fleet meta is basically a "bring more people" contest. Pipebombing may still work, but the more traditional blingy brawlers are definitely **waaay** past their prime. They barely worked years ago because of the sheer numbers nullblobs could field, and they have only grown since.
---
Some of the lore items do have ISK value, depending on how many were released and how long ago.
---
that the new giant ark ship in the back there? guess that means that will be the final boss in these new incursions
---
... to its members.
---
Yeah I mean I fly mostly small gang, I'm not saying they're not strong and hard to fly against, but they're not OP, and just encourage ewar diversity in the fleet, which I like.
---
You know the vaga used to be a kite ship right? Before CCP poo poo'd all over TE's to nerf the blaster Talos.
---
That falloff bonus (range bonus) is what helped make the vaga a good kite ship.
---
Nowadays its a memey 100mn or dual prop brawler that just dies against other more competent brawlers. Or people trying to relive the glory days of ac kiting, and enjoying not being able to break a dual rep vexor at point range in any reasonable time.
---
If it could fit arty reliably, you could use that falloff bonus better, but it doesnt have grid and the muninn would arguably still be better.
---
Like mentioned already, the deimos can actually take advantage of the range bonus with rails. Not every deimos is blaster fit. Also, there was a time where you could blaster kite with a deimos.
---
So they both have usable range bonuses. This new HAC missing a range bonus is unusual and goes against the role of all HACs being range bonused. Which can create confusion for players when CCP starts making random exceptions.
---
In 2 years, reddit will have posts about "Why doesnt the ikitursa have a range bonus like all the other HACs?" Then proceed to make 3 posts a week about the same thing due to random exceptions and inconsistencies.
---
Shouldn't you be getting busy "going nuclear" on me?
---
Thats ok the fit i have is all about the drone i just can not give you till 1:30 eve time at work till then
---
Well I can only speculate.

Reddit: "CCP make the new player experience better!"
---
Reddit: "CCP why are you fucking with this and not working on FW/WH/Null/capitals/Olmeca's whining?:
---
I don't blame you for not posting your loot pinata toon on reddit.
---
I'd say there is a difference between leasing land you control to the corporations within your alliance that you control through military might to earn funds for alliance actions/srp/etc;
---
and paying a military overlord funds to have access to his space so you can space krab.
---
Kind of. CCP came out with new structures to replace Outposts and POSs. Keepstars are the biggest and can house Titans/Supers
---
&gt; and ONLY God can defeat it
---
I'm going to quote this for reasons in the immediate and direct future;
---
But you misspelled our lord and savior Bob.
---
He comes for you all.
---
Paasive moons are gone, you have to have boots on the ground farming moons now, so it is not nearly as sexy of income as it was.  Small groups with a good chain can make bank of they put man hours in ect, but big alliances have a harder time squeezing isk out of the process.
---
Whew. Thank goodness they nerfed that nasty triglavian frig. Damn thing was OP. Lol, not.
---
To some, just like dwarf fortress, losing is fun.
---
The fun is had in playing the game.

(With no turrets)
---
Any indication on how the mechanics work? I'm really hoping CCP does something more interesting than just copy &amp; paste sansha incursion mechanics.
---
Am I reading eveonion again?  I still remember the last game that had player courts (minus the blockchain) and it was hilarious. Why don't you take your blockchain and invent something to keep track of dragon kill points or something as far away as possible?
---
that's awesome. finally a real invasion and not "excursions" ??!?! CCP finally grew some balls?
---
bless you
---
Even triangle natives are doing kiki fleets now
---
Hm, yeah that's right now that I think about it. I mean I guess we shouldn't be comparing the drek, a combat bc, with the iki, a hac. It'll be interesting seeing the hac meta grow even more
---
Went in on Sisi this morning in a secondary update; probably will hit TQ very soon, as a launcher image.
---
Catalyst needs a third midslot.
---
But but the prophecy trailer.....
---
Yeah, it's not meaningfully faster than the Drek, and you still need an ACR to fit it properly: despite however much CCP want it to be true, noone is fitting 800mm plates on ships in these roles...
---
Is there any area in FW that is particularly good for 1v1s?
---
Well, let's put it this way: are you ready for EVE. St. Petersburg? Because we are. ;)  
---
 [https://puu.sh/DmUlo/faead8fa7a.jpg](https://puu.sh/DmUlo/faead8fa7a.jpg)
---
Yes but it will be in Russian
---
Imagine a POS you can dock in with titans, unlimited space for storage like a station, a beam of safety that makes it so anything within 50km of the structure is invincible, takes no damage and cannot be fired on (if they are blue to it).  
---
It also has asset safety, so if your keepstar dies and you are on vacation for 5 years, you will come back to find it in a npc  station that you can undock from but not dock back into.  You have to pay a small like 5% or less fee to get it back, a long with anything else in it.
---
It also can equip a doomsday better than any titans, and can strap on missiles, ecm, cap warfare modules, and even flights of fighters and fighter bombers for good measure.  
---
Nobody will engage these structures at 0km, unless there is a 0% chance anyone will form to defend it.  Current meta to kill them is long ranged titan blobs, and occasionally super blobs.
---
Hell yeah
---
Thank you for listing those rules, I will use those to fix pricing issues, thank you!
---
Brug that's like 7 injectors for me for every pilot. I'm hype AF for this
---
Moon POS no longer print isk passivley. In fact POS are gone and replaced by a variety of player-built stations called citadels. One of these, a refinery type, shoots a giant cutting laser at moons, slowly drags up a chunk of moon rock over days/weeks, and then it gets blasted to bits by another giant laser before Rorquals swarm in like locusts to hoover up the moon ores.
---
I thought this was the poster to a new star wars movie for a second there...
---
fairly certain omegas get a free praxis and gnosis
---
not much has changed then :)
---
no it wont be livestreamed
---
Or wait until your 15th log on then buy the plex and get all the omega stuff in one stop
---
Is Eve St. Petersburg for real? 
---
Or is CCP going to just send one of those Japanese robots in a world-class counter troll?
---
or buy gametime and save $$
---
Glad to hear y'all are still around.
---
You beat me too it =P
---
OMEGAS?  i dont care about omegas when my 500 man bot army runs in alpha i want alpha!

Came here to say this lol. Holy fuck thats a retarded idea.

Nice first post.

What...... Are they trying to make null sec more appealing to carebears?
---
You can't control dinobrains when it comes to reddit
---
there like an alphabit translator out yet?
---
The only thing that could have made it more purple, and probably better, was if he had loaded some sansha Ultra-violet.
---
Fuck me... So you can't bump people away from the station after undocking anymore? Or just randomly smart bomb them when they're chilling outside? :(
---
don't look too closely at his ammo

Hopefully no one.

This is wrong. They were bad videos that do not hold up.  Treacle like pacing, trite garbage narration. They were the best* eve videos out, but that does not make them good.

Feels good coming back after 5 years and still being KOS to CVA 😀

&gt; The fun is had in playing the game.

urgh disgusting!
---
Combine these structures with rorquals getting huge mining boosts, and now you can buy a titan hull for 42 bil in some regions or a fitted one for 55 bil.  Then add on injectors, and anyone that farms the game a  lot can afford a titan alt and a fax alt.  
---
Now the imperium can form 250 man titan fleets and panfam wont even undock.
---
Nah, we have plenty of lowsec. Those FW people seeking lowsec generally move there.
---
Drifter incursion 2: Electric Boogaloo
---
He should have had an Exit Strategy
---
Range bonus instead of the strange fitting bonus and commensurate improved fitting would be vastly preferable. Chop and change that per level fitting bonus with the role bonus like the Rodiva/Zarmazd to lend it some specialisation, perhaps lose the remote repair range/cap use for neut/SB fitting for example.
---
Again? Ugh

Unstable damage controls :)

---
Saw the ping and kill after putting daughter to bed, shame I couldn't be there!
---
I have never once met a new player who directly benefited from the Agency window or it's first two reworks.
---
You can still bump them, but unless they are afk for 30 min it is not going to happen. Smart bombs and other aoe does not hit them.  
---
Even the small less than 1 bil cost structures have like a 15km beam that you can safely log titans out at.  You can safe log while tethered.  Regular caps can dock at the middle sized fortizars, and they also pack a punch, normally get killed at range as well.
---
I want to run a fleet of police ishtars around null trying to rp arrest people.
---
All of this sounds so wrong. Was there no player pushback to this?
---
I'm not even sure if there were 250 (definitely not more than 500) titans in the entire game in 2014-ish.
---
RnK were nothing special.
---
Title... Yes. Stuff needs to be destroyed to keep the economy going, not teleported magically to safety.
---
The system effects are different. Notably, it seems to INCREASE mining capabilities while seriously reducing drones and hull.
---
It is really too early to say. CCP are spawning and despawning the sites to test them at the moment, so I didn't get much more than an opportunity to have my shuttle popped. 
---
There was a player Fortizar in the system, it didn't seem to have been attacked by the Trig, but it was also in a "withdrawing" state, thanks to CCP devhacks.
---
Its always about Kenny...
---
It seems really underpowered for being a tech 2, especially eith the amount of resources it takes to build each. Being t1, the drek won't require any of the new parts. The ikitursa should gain a role bonus of spooling up faster than the vedmak or the drek.
---
Did somebody say something about a wizard hat?
---
Nope. And worst of all these structures have damage caps, so unlike dominion sov structures these can't be destroyed easily.
---
And and wait until you hear what they did to sov.
---
Loot fairy was kind, very kind
---
Yup. Losing tactical supremacy is a sure sign to GTFO
---
The dps bonus after spool up also doesn't negate the fact that you would be able to field 2 or 3 dreks for the price of one vedhac. How does the tank on the vedhac look anyways?
---
It almost looks like gallente resistance but with a little extra explosive built in.
---
I barely remember the sov mechanics themselves (I think POSes had a sov module on them at one point, right?).
---
Don't you have to siege down some kind of special control point or something now and then the system becomes "at-risk?" You forget a lot.
---
Activity is dropping, time to force people to login for rewards once a day for 16 day! - ccp logic.  
---
80% of this is garbage that nobody wants to fill out this "activity boosting" event. TLDR; CCP is paying us 1.2m sp to login for the next two weeks.
---
It should melt those cap stable dual rep deimos with spool up heat and drugs but let's face it, punching a deimos in the face for upwards of 3 to 4 minutes just gives him time call in those extra reinforcements.
---
Woo, free large projectile turret level 5. Dread alt almost finished!
---
Did you do something special to support current Siege Module state (the fact that it is stacking, still not fixed after 3 weeks), or is it just intrinsic to fresher database?
---
Even the loot fairy looks down on his krabbing ways.
---
Considerably better than the TQ version, at least.
---
I would like to see blue wrecks be scanable and all wrecks turn blue 15 minutes before they despawn.
---
Is this for each pilot? Or per account??
---
Damavik isn't bad. But it is weird to nerf that and not kiki or leshak, which are the ones that are arguably OP.
---
Is this for each pilot or per account?
---
I'm guessing per account not per pilot
---
Per account
---
&gt; I though they didn't wanted mutaplasmid for resist stuff because it could get too high ?
---
They said that to fend off the pitchforks over enchantment, I guess they never meant it.
---
The whole system is terrible for Eve.
---

I feel bad for Slyce tho, they are some really good guys but for some reason Rick hasn't moved his alliance somewhere else, and that's killing them. Roaming there feels almost depressive
---
Geez he even had a 300+ mil mtu on field.
---
I mean, that works too. No rush, just buy that PLEX before the 17th :)
---

Ah nice. Doritos language.

I have recorded this as an .mp4, then converted to a .gif

We had almost killed him when we realize, hey maybe we should kill that MTU first. No regrets there.
---
More players wanted to hop in shiny big ships, than there were bittervets to push the statis quo.  
---
Goons started farmville in delve about 2+ years ago, and then test got evicted and moved next door.  
---
Panfam was idle and went around killing easier targets for free wins.  
---
About a year ago PANfam tried to capitalize on provi block structures that were going to be a one time cash grab.  They got kicked back home in one of their worst defeats.  There was a massive titan vs titan battle where imperium killed a keepstar despite ncpl and friends defending with their own super fleets.  That sealed the deal, and panfam officially lost its number 1 super fleet strength, at least in my mind.  
---
Right now imperium by far has the largest super fleet, with goons likely having the largest of a single alliance without the rest of their banners ( like the initiative can form 75+ titans and 50+ supers for a pre pinged cta, not goons, but goons lite)  which makes their coalition strength massive.
---
I probably would have deleted the game and walked away.
---
What stat are you talking about HAW damage? Tank amount?
---
Apologize? Heh, let them first show that they do not bot and cheat their way to riches, then we can talk about apologies.
---
A lot of stuff has changed, but the core of what makes EVE still EVE is still there. If you are unsure of coming back, just login with your old account and fly around as a alpha for a while. It's free and will give you a better sense of the game then you will get from just reading about it on reddit.
---
I’m honestly impressed with the naming of everything in Eve, some of it seems exotic, but still pronounceable.
---
The fuck is that resist profile? And the same slot layout as vedmak? I really hope it is just WIP, as it was with rodiva/zarmazd for first couple of days.
---
Really hoped for a range bonus at least on a hac :(
---
Thx for explanation!
---
You can get 85k EHP out of it max linked up with 2 damage mods. Fully brick tanked it's comparable to a brick Sac, with 130k EHP linked up.
---
I think the extra damage potential is largely meaningless in a game where a small gang has to kill caps inside 10 minutes to avoid the inevitable cynohammer, and the lack of projection is painful.
---
I've said somewhere else already that I'd prefer them rejigging the fitting bonus into the ship role bonuses, possibly replacing remote repairer range and cap need with 50% neut and smartbomb fitting, then making the per level bonuses on HAC skill 10% ramp speed + max ramp and 10% optimal. 
---
This results in same total ramp time as current hulls but to a higher overall damage mod (half the current extra) but much more likelihood of getting to it, and having a better damage/time performance over short time intervals than Vedmak, while maintaining the 'all HACs have a range bonus' logic and making it properly competitive with the Drekavac.
---
how do you get it to show type in combat logs
---
Control points spawn over the entire constellation, you then have a timed capture system and you need to not die during it. The team with the most nodes at the end wins.
---
Nice job. Doing god's work.  These bot VNI's don't even put out light drones... should easily beat off Retri with Acol II's no?
---
No, he’s a Falcon
---
No not really. There's is no such thing as a fair fight. Your best bet is to ask for 1v1s.
---
literally nobody wants more Gnosis stahppp
---
As an EXIT leadership type guy.... I'm super glad it was Odin's that snagged the kill, they're good guys - soz, not soz, to those that missed out.  
---
From EXIT side there is not amaze-balls AAR. He was up at a redic time, in a fit far and above that required of ratting. he was in a site, he was sieged, he got tackled and he died along with his MTU. Clearly the loot fairy was drunken than I've ever been (and I'm Australian, so that's..... pretty drunk).
---
Would something have happened to the MTU if you kill him first?
---
I guess Odin called?   
---
.... I went too far... I'll let myself out.
---
Fucking peasants
---
*shitposts on Reddit*
---
But do you realize that SoE skins and new SoE hulls would be eaten out of your hands - fingers, thumbs, wrists and all?
---
oh wait that acronym can now mean Assault Damage Control or Abyssal Damage Control.
---
I propose we change the nickname of Assault Damage Control to AssDC.
---
Guess there are people playing it as MMO
---
It would have grabbed the wreck of the paladin, whatever modules it dropped, and then when it exploded from percussive maintenance, might have lost all the shiny loot in the explosion.
---
They put the drones on the gate to make camping the gate easier. The effect that this has is two fold, it decloaks cloaky ships and it lags the people who come through making it more likely to get a instawarp ship because the added latency to their align time pushed them over 2s.
---
Welcome to my world
---
Woulda picked up loot, when they kill multi it’s a second lottery and therefore 1/4 of what the paladin fitted.
---
Second roll of the loot fairy if the mtu scoops the wreck
---
I love iskies, especially when I can use it to buy thannies for my toonies so I can play with my corpies!
---
we're always up for renting it out. contact me for good prices.
---
Well your opinion is just that. Your opinion.  And what did I say LM makes the best EVE videos. How about you give me a couple examples of better EVE videos than the Rooks and Kings vids?
---
Sounds like a reasonable change, bet it never happens. I also said somewhere else that a ramp up bonus would be beneficial. If this is a small gang style ship, it needs to hit hard and fast. A 3 to 4 minute ramp up time is not fast. An optimal range bonus eould be nice but I wouldn't mind doing without it but then again, I like brawling (brawling megas matter)
---
Incursions are sure, `hard` to bot, but they're really easy to isbox (or even legitimately multibox), and the only reason they're considered `hard` to bot is because the alternative literally involves 5 keypresses per 30 minutes site.
---
Pubbies gonna pub
---
HAW damage, yeah.
---
(For some reason i thought capital guns were affected as well, but apparently i miscalculated, my bad)
---
remindme! May 13th, 2019
---
Agents Finder is still lacking over half of the functionality of the one before Agency.
---
Agency is far slower, restricting search to High/Low/Null is still not possible, and other garbage.
---
I don't even want to know what they are smoking at CCP...
---
If he died before the mtu, there was a chance that the mtu would scoop the wreck before they looted it. That would reduce the chances for them to get that sweet loot that dropped.
---
I know zero about Eve. I ended up here by hitting Random Subreddit. It’s like you guys are speaking a different language. But it’s still awesome to read threads like this. 👍🏻
---
Always go through certified 3rd party vendors.
---
Something something SP out of thin air
---
god damn bloobs killing the geeme

Loot fairy said fuck yes, I  bequeath unto thee these worldly possessions and then some.

Out of the loop here. Were triglavian invasion mechanics announced? If so, when?

I am now sufficiently triggered.

Don't fly what you can't afford to lose

lm hoping that somone will stream it  theres no reason not to
---
I think that's why there is Depend®
---
I am somewhat new to the Abyssal, what is this room? I guess these are special randomly generated rooms that only occur in T5 sites minimum?
---
I too exclusively load t1 ammo into my officer fit marauder

What are these new asteroid/ore types?

Not to be mistaken with BoB, who are dead and gone (tho I think Molle is still active? But disgustinly irrelevant? idk)

---
I was wondering about that... today they treat the Yulai massacre like some wacky fun space hijinks but all of those Zombie Inc players were permabanned for finding a way to tank Concord.
---
Maybe add more airhorn?
---
Any percentage based drop system is a horrible idea because assets can’t be easily divided. It ends up in wild swings in value of items based completely on rng.
---
A better system would be a percentage of the asset safety fee should drop for the attacker.
---
Example: the defender has 5b in assets that go into assets safety when the structure is destroyed. The fee to recover the assets from asset safety is 750m (15%). Have crates containing 562m isk (75% of the fee) drop in the wreck.
---
Oh my god. This better be good.
---
Expecting more info this weekend at EVE Russia.
---
&gt;SRP
---
And so it beginns ...
---
Dammit, I just updated 3 hours ago!
---
Seriously though, thanks for being on-point, this is worth another update.
---
Any idea what's going on with the NPC avatar that was added?
---
Any idea if this is supposed to be a temporary thing, or is it going to become like the Sansha Incursions?
---
Just what the state of the game called for lol - *incursion buffs*
---
You think that's a shock, try quiting in 2010 and then logging back in late 2018.
---
* **Asset safety**. What the actual fuck (tho I confess I *did* use it to get all my stuff from null into a central location... shame on me)
---
* **Coalitions being even more horrible**. They are the reason I quit. Yes, let's all form into these nameless blobs and do nothing. BACK IN MY DAY... but whatever.
---
* **CCP getting bought by a Korean MMO publisher**. Yes, this is horrible. No, it will not end well.
---
* **Events? Login rewards**? ugh this is not eve
---
* **Overview filled with Upwell garbage.** I thought that alliances were overdoing it with all these outposts in nullsec back then. Surely, not every system needed an outpost? Well, how about multiple Keepstars and retarded amounts of the smaller variants? And for good measure, lets also put them in highsec. Filtering them out with the overview helps tho.
---
But it's not all bad. There were *some* QoL changes I actually enjoyed.
---
* **Fitting manager**. Goddamn, this is fantastic. Don't even need EFT anymore
---
* **Tabbed overview**. Cant recall whether this was a thing in 2010, but if so, it's definately improved.
---
* But as a Caldari... **Missile launchers** being visible on the ship. Oof. Badass.
---
It would give those capital sized scanning rig BPCs a home, finally.
---
More likely that they'd non-consensually blue Frat tbh.
---
it's not nessacery about break even damage part. When someone can tank the damage of the vedmak. doing 250 extra dps may be what will break it. It will be great in abyssal pvp where you even get a resistance debuff after a while in a stalemate.
---
As a former wormholer, I agree. But it would be dumb to force our style of play on everyone. It will cause a mass exodus because people want to have fun and most won't enjoy the wormhole lifestyle. It would legitimately put EVE at risk of an exodus.
---
It has not been formally announced, but they have building up to it for the last several months.
---
Please CCP, something to actually shake the proverbial sov tree, been wanting this for years now, dammit.
---
Autistic screeching. Although he could have added some more e's to make it clear.
---
Correct. You get it maybe 10% of the time but in the past you landed 100km. From the enemies which gave the high value ab gilas time to escape but if you land at 0, you're basically dead. They outdps you before you can even kill a few.
---
Well, that’s a distinction and I think it’s important enough to make that clearer.
---
‘Reeddit’ reads like a typo.
---
‘Reeeddit’ indicates: they meant to do that.
---
/Not really enamoured by the whole autistic screeching idea. Specifically because I met a few people at Fanfest who were on the autism spectrum and they were solid people to a man. My fellow pilots with an autism spectrum disorder are fine people and I don’t associate incoherent screeching with them at all. Quite the contrary. I have seen perfectly ‘normal’ people do things that would make one doubt their status.
---
/I’m not even criticising, it’s Fanfest. If it’s going to happen anywhere, good Bob almighty, let it be at Fanfest :-).
---
//Generally well-disposed towards my fellow pilots. I can’t even hold a grudge to those who blew up my boats over the years. That’s part of what the place is.
---
I can't wait to see these new entropic mutaplasmid prices lol
---
Ah OFOC!
---
The thing that looks like a trig incursion, please CCP, not a shitty HS stuff again
---
the only ammo that does not get damaged by using it !
---
GOT A PDF/ text VERSTION? NOT AN IMAGE?
---
Person doing PvE is found by someone doing PvP; nonconsensual explosive disassembly followed. At the conclusion of the Explosive Event, some (or all, or none) of the components of the Explodee's ship are left behind, and the Exploder can then take these as lovely parting gifts. In this case, *very* lovely parting gifts; 25 Billion ISK is a nice chunk of change.
---
New agency window, just as terrible as the old one, who woulda thought.
---
*You could warn them... if only you spoke Doritos!*
---
You would need the font for those to work.
---
It is per account. You redeem the skillpoints on the account and then can choose the character you apply them to.
---
Triglav Are Chinese?
---
Triglavian Titan invasion vs goonswarm
---
What is this "World Ark" they speak of
---
Dread? 
---
:)
---
Im on the spectrum too aswell as some of my friends but at some point i just accepted it that most people who use the word autistic don't even know what it means. It's easier to laugh with them than getting upset every time.
---
Modified amarr profile. Em hole is my guess.
---
Have you used the new jump bridges? They are the best thing the game has added in the last 10 years.
---
Alternatively for people who aren't just angry bitter neckbeards : CCP is giving us stuff for doing something we'd already be doing because we like EVE and log in to have fun.
---
It's a difficult thing to grasp, I know.
---
There was change in EVE - haw guns got 2x DPS base DPS nerf (damage multiplier for guns, rof for missile launchers) and siege module got 2x dps boost, but it was stacking penalized. So yes it was EVE change + manual change to adapt to that on pyfa side.
---
Pam: They’re all the same picture.
---
Your insults need to come with a cipher key so us mere mortals can decode what the hell it is you mean.
---
Something something Triglavian Titan

What ever happened to Ishtar fleets?

I wasn't done crying yet and you have renewed my sadness. Thanks, I hate it.

Wait CCP got bought by Koreans? ooooooh fuck. Abandon ship.

afaik that just means you'll be a world famous physicist and cosmologist, who does awesome stuff and becomes the epitome of genius
---
Gigidy gigidy
---
You ping for a marauder tackled?
---
I feel like this could have been funny.  The problem is it's far too ramble-y to really make a coherent point other than the rather tired 'Trump is dumb' angle.   
---
If this was aimed at a particular EVE-famous person, it might work, but as it stands, it falls flat. It doesn't sound anything like Vily or Sapporo Jones, as those two are smart, articulate folks who can form complete sentences, paragraphs, and more.   
---
2/10 - Go back to the drawing board with this one.
---
you don't know, maybe he CAN afford to lose that much. doesn't mean that it's sane, but it fits the rule!
---
Rad Guru!
---
So you can play them at once. Have your BB or BC clear out rats, your Noctis alt salvage.
---
&gt;INCREASE mining capabilities
---
get the rorqs
---
I was just thinking, a long event vs the triglavians would be pretty neat if done the right way. I was thinking something along the lines of the original WoW AQ40 event and how everyone had to do shit to get it to start but there was mini events leading up to it. Although it would need to be a lot different of course, the thought of a big event everyone could participate in and then the end would be it drastically changing the landscape like opening a new region would be pretty neat.
---
No.  
---
"imagine a circumstance where assets are under threat of complete destruction, it would galvanize entire alliances into putting up the best fight they could, at the moment, from past observations with the asset safety mechanic it has just lead to alliances saying “oh well” and then just leaving a citadel to die and having people waiting (insert asset safety waiting time, i don’t know it) before they start playing the game again. This forces a choice, you either get the assets out, you put up a fight and protect the assets or you loose the assets."
---
basically it would galvanize whole alliances to just up and quit after a loss.  There just isn't the well of fresh meat anymore to refill the coffers.
---
He was asking about NC and PL, not goons and tapi
---
You expect people who have just joined the game to know about all that? Let's throw in a non-tech savvy person in here, what if he doesn't know what sso means?
---
Gotcha yes that was what I was trying to ask lol thank you
---
I think s better comparison would be the iki vs either the deimos or sacrilege in terms of dps. Both armor, one is known for its high damage and the other for its tank. Compare the dps  output, damage dealt, and average dps tank assuming omni damage
---
We run them in abyssal trios in Retributions.
---
Can be tough but we've cleared every one we've had so far.
---
(a) Please invade Jita!
---
(b) attack and kill citadels anchored in the invaded systems
---
I run them in trio hawks and usually don't have a major problem as well. But rip any cruiser thst comes up against this
---
the mining buff is reduced laser cycle time
---
id take 3 hours of station shooting over 1 hour of fozzie sov
---
You have to click every day else you get nuffin'.
---
I thought we're talking about Damavik's bonus changed from range to resists...
---
over the last month, a rare room has appeared in the abys dealing with the new update stuff. 
---
thers only 1 gate and its always open, 1 cache that has a special semiosis conductor vault thingy, and a FUCKTON of leshaks.
---
you just gotta scoop loot and run, not kill everything.
---
the room itself has a giant dread/station thingy (its massive like a citadel but has a giant gun so)
---
ill find videos of it in a few mins if u dont find it before then
---
What tier/filament did you run in Retris?
---
Damn, so does that mean even the blingy Gilas have about a 10% chance of getting completely screwed in T5 sites?
---
Wormhole corp.
---
Weird thing is that whenever someone leaves Goons , all Goons immediately realise that he was an utter and an incompetent shite and no one wanted to play with him. One could only wonder.
---
Very possibly. I'm not going to run t5 in my Gila for the time being.
---
not sure i have come across fleets of duel rep, blaster deimos  though.
---
So what fits have a good chance of tanking through this that are cruiser sized? I thought AB was sort of the norm for a lot of these more tanky fits.
---
He can't because there aren't any.
---
T5s, any non-darks, although we don't think we could clear an escalated wave in a Firestorm if there are lots of reps on grid.
---
In terms of how easy they are to run:
---
Electrical &gt; Exotic &gt; Gamma/Firestorm &gt;&gt;&gt; Dark
---
Classic.
---
Does anyone managed to run this in Linux?
---
Im surprised you manage to get retris to tank T5s. Mind sharing the fit? Im getting kinda bored of Hawks.
---
&lt;3
---
Has anyone managed to run this on Linux? I always fail miserably.
---
Evolution is also still kicking.
---
Which is even more surprising to me.
---
Hybrids actually have really nice falloff, and not everyone flies deimos purely as a useless q-click blaster ship.
---
"If you want to mine, join Goons!"
---
Wait ... what?
---
Either guy rats in them for the lulz or just doesnt want to rat in a carrier. Niddy/Thanny with 2-3 Sensor Boosters and 1 Signal amplifier is 10 times cheaper, locks almost as fast as with NSA and can actually warp away. Bigger ticks too
---
I'm surprised you get enough damage to clear sites in Hawks :D
---
These are run by 3 pilots, so not so good if you want to try and box them.

1v1 against a ship of its class it will win every time. If you need a +1  or more then it’s not balanced. It’s broken. Don’t justify your shitty meta because you know I’m right.

Here's a more useful set of statistics, as OP is comparing a 3 damage mod Drek to 2 damage mod Iki, both being somewhat questionable fits under most circumstances.

today and you have until downtime to claim today's rewards.

any fit that will generally run them will be fine for most rooms, hacs are awesome cuz they get a mwd sig bonus so they can go fast but not get rekt by sig bloom, but an ab gila would still finish it.

Hope they drop them good drifter drugs with no penalties again. lol
---
I’m not really upset, it just doesn’t amuse me. Specifically because I’ve met a few people [and I wouldn’t have known that if they had not told me so themselves, it’s not me making a judgement call] at Fanfest. I had a great time with them. I don’t care to have a few cheap laughs just because these people happen to be affected.
---
I laugh often at Fanfest, and mostly because someone did something really stupid. That I find funny, I’ve no problem laughing with that. There’s plenty to laugh with. Most of the people there are adults. When they make a spectacle of themselves, hey cousin, that’s just the way the cookie crumbles.
---
This: “That guy has autism, hardiharhar.”, that does nothing for me.
---
Jesus thats a tad expensive. Looks fun though.
---
And yeh, average finish time of 16-18 minutes in the hawks. Darks are cheap filaments as well.
---
It did. Damavik, as a T1 frig, is probably now a more capable scram kiter in novice plexes due to the resist bonus.
---
Thanks for the links and info, would like to get into at least T4s myself, but I like not going in completely blind, also a very interesting new content source to see what sort of shit gets thrown at you.
---
&gt; 50km is huge jesus.
---
I'm pretty sure the keepstar docking ring is well over 100 km.
---
100 km is the distance from undock to max safe tether that titans use (not sure what it is used for, but have seen corp bookmarks for it).
---
Loot fairy dear god yes
---
The guy in the background looks like he from Destiny 2. LOL
---
Just out of curiosity, how expensive/blingy are the Assault frigate fits you were using in that picture?
---
Just give the capital ship a DD that can one shot any Rorq that is in panic :)
---
Completely haram. I thought about resubbing for some lols, but now definitely not.
---
Agreed, but I just have to point out; the latest patch nerfed NSAs, you can no longer activate warp while the NSA is active.
---

---
If you're too old for Make-a-wish, you could ask CCP. Failing that, just start a kickstarter like everyone in America when they have expensive medical problems.

What T2 ships are getting added?  Just HAC?
---
I've got it.
---
There are a few different kinds. It's important to find out what kind this is. It might take time to make this determination. Some types are just an annoyance. I piss my pants once in a while these days and that's about it.  For a lot of people it doesn't get worse than that.  You most probably won't die from it. 
---
Eve helped a lot when I first got diagnosed. It was a pretty bad flare-up and I was bedridden for about 2 months, had to take sick leave from work etc. 
---
When I started to recover physically I treated eve like a full time job and it really helped me prepare mentally for a return to work. Have been back for a month now and all is well.
---
well, KWG botted there for years and has nothing to show for it except the PIRAT wallet.
---
PIBC botted on Serenity and took over the whole universe.  Given the choice, it seems obvious that PIBC are superior.
---
Are they gate camping?
---
I liked zombies and what they did, it was hilarious. It was clearly an exploit of the ingame mechanics though, and it was all fine and dandy after the first time, iirc they still did it after they were told to stop is the issue in which case it would be ban worthy. Memory is a bit fuzzy on that though so maybe not. It was the catalyst for the concord changes as well so it couldn't be repeated.
---
I usually go for other frigates. Or Bigger ships if I can get xlose enough to close orbit then.
---
I hope you wont get isk or loot or even salvage from it. There is no need for another income. The only thing you should get is a free system again.
---
The problem with citadels right now imo is even in low power the defender has all the advantages. You can timezone tank your abandoned raitarus making them cancerous to bash. Give us the ability to disable the day or time for low power structures to help with combating spam.
---
I literally stopped playing with SV and then liberty squad when they deployed to support SV/snuff.

Hope that helps.

It's ok, you need 16 logins in 18 days.

I don't even expect newbros to know how to fit a tackle frig.  I just expect them to click the link I sent them.  If they think it's sketchy then I expect them to do what I did in 2008 when I joined a null corp for the first time - Google it and satisfy themselves that it's legit, then click the link I sent them.
---
If they're so un-tech savvy they can't Google it, I don't want em.
---
Yes. The more DPS they do to you, the more visible the circle is.
---
I lol'd that people are still this naive with CCP's track record.  It's no wonder they never improve, so many fanboys.
---
A friend that is going through an inter-continental move, so hence been unable to play Eve (or anything), was surprised to find that he really doesn't miss it.
---
If you do play Eve, I highly recommend taking the 'lols' direction.  That leads to the most fun.
---
I recently noticed a lowsec corp (when my cyno ship went 'boom!') that exclusively uses T1 ships, and throws them at everything.  It's corps like that which I really respect, and would recommend for the 'lols'.

More server-crushing crap that probably won't be run because Triglavians are overpowered, wee.

any fucking day
---
Imagine all of EVE are filled with ships like this, but you rarely see them because they never die. Ships like this can be bought, fitted, sent out ratting for months or years until the owner quits the game, and we would never know it existed.      
---
    
---
Schrodinger's ALOD.
---
I'm also tracking this and am looking forward to the initial release :)  Do you have a discord?
---
get the hulks
---
The Draugur's speed is so far out of line with the rest of the Command Destroyer role that a Bifrost heating it's AB outruns an MWD Draugur. At least we won't have cancer nano sig bonused Kikis but my god do these ships go as far as possible to not match their role.
---
At least we still have Falcon!  ... . . .... ....   God I hate life.
---
More like closing the existing one; EVE has already too much space.
---
is it too late to say "INB4 wtf loREEEEEEEEE items?!"
---
Don't worry, any time CCP finds something actually fun they crush it with extreme prejudice.
---
I really hope they make these even harder than the incursions and also that they will invade neighboring systems in low and null. This could be really good.
---
They don't do anything. its just meant as a nod to in-game actions of players.
---
personally i like them because i appreciate all the little things we as a collective have done over the years, but they're gonna be most appealing to the people who were there.
---
We're also capsuleers, IP law is for normal people
---
Great another F1 pusher that has no idea how the game works.
---
...I feel I should stop winning EVE...
---
I'd fly incursions if Little Big or hard bass started playing upon entering system.
---
So you want out posts back? Unkillable stations in null sec? We always had asset safety, it just was not called it.
---
I'll take everything back if you'll yell at me and call me a retard again in your fleet voice on vocaroo. Please PGL I crave it.
---
Provi didn't notice
---
You didnt answer my question. Why would an invading force with control of an enemy system and starbases allow the enemies assets to leave?
---
What if the Trigs are attacking the empires, including high sec and low sec, with low sec having exclusive rewards.
---
That could breathe some major life into some neglected space
---
maybe
---
F's
---
If you go by the biblical definition of the ark it has the ability to take ships 'onboard' also - so maybe it is a bit like a flying citadel?
---
=fc
---
Sorry for having fun playing a video game my dude.
---
? I only see the 75k rewards
---
The last one says 50,000, not 1,000,000.
---
??
---
A 'Gates of Ahn'Qiraj' sort of approach? That would be pretty cool
---
You're thinking everyone is perfect and will use Corp logistics to just haul stuff in every time they need a ship. 
---
People will absolutely keep more ships than they need, boat back to safe ports in the middle of their sov to buy more ships, or keep ships in a close LS or npc station to store their shit. 
---
All 3 of those increase the risk of getting ganked. If you only keep one or two of each ship and lose them quick you're not gonna wait on a hauling contract to get more if there's content around. 
---
People are hella impatient and lazy dude
---
For reference a Draugur (with expected fit, 1 poly for speed mods) is the same speed as a no speed mod Thrasher, and less than barely above half the speed of a meta Bifrost fit, considering everything without links.
---
Adding Rapid Deployment to the Draugur boosts it up to a little below the speed of an unlinked Stork, again with no speed mods on the Stork and a Poly on the Draugur. It really is quite pitiful, while it's understandable that a sig bonused Kiki could be quite absurd, adding a ship that's half the speed of the standard in it's role, and -3 slots compared to comparable ships, is not the way to do it.
---
Odin's Call is so fucking dope. Nice kill fam.
---
I think the three timers that are currently in use are sufficient for a partial loot drop if a structure dies in 0.0. 
---
I agree that more structures need to explode.
---
Nonconsensual explosive disassembly. Beautiful. Thank you for the layman’s translation.
---
I demand NPC vs NPC battles that we can join :D
---
So what happens if the trig invasion meets a sansha incursion...
---
If i'm reading this right,  546132  NOTICE: Capsuleers exiting from Raging and Chaotic type portals will incur a 15 minute Suspect Timer and may be targeted for their cargo. Be careful!
---
The moment there is no Jag on the killmail...
---
You dont do exploration in an ascendency Nyx?  Peasant!
---
I don't have a discord, but once I get a public release out I'll make one and link it in the reddit post telling people that this is a thing :)
---
I would not mind a dead space raid, a fc needs 20-30  ships of a frigate class. Like the current incursions.
---
Readability and ease of use is definitely my number one priority, I'm going to try and keep the depth of information that Evernus can provide while keeping it easy to understand for people who are just getting into the program.
---
https://web.ccpgamescdn.com/fiction/eveonline/Triglavian/AHSFTIJVYUECOJG.mp4
---
see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bj4w5f/video_triglavian_capital_video_from_level_v/) for more info. Based on prior models and comparisons, it's a Triglavian titan that is [significantly larger](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b9gz7c/so_it_turns_out_that_triglavian_capship_is_way/) than any other ship currently in the game.
---
Stop capitalizing random words. Stop that. It makes you look like an idiot.
---
congrats, you can blob someone 100000 vs 1! stunning and brave. 
---
nullsec is cancer.
---
Brisc wasn't attacked by anyone for being Republican though. Why are you trying to milk this virtually insignificant incident (in the grand scheme of national politics) to play the conservative victim card?
---
Lol you made my day :)
---
"Breaking: The Triglavian Collective has launched a full-scale invasion of Delve.  More news as the story develops..."
---
Edit: upvote for amusingly sociopathic, extensible idea.
---
If he can afford to lose that much then why is he bothering to rat at all lmao?
---
The Triglavian 'World Ark', named *Xordazh*, is a supercapital ship that is many times larger than the titans currently used by capsuleers (Promethean titans).
---
How do you TZ tank against NPCs? They will form for every fight...
---
**Next time on: Burn Jita...**
---
If you look under each of the rewards that you are able to see, you'll see that there is another row of omega rewards that maybe your brain is erasing into empty boxes? They are darker because whoever took this picture is on an alpha account.
---
Omg, i love it, we need some RPG aspect of the game to be visibale to attract new players to Eve online, this gives depth to the story of the universe!
---
Not sure what the goal is here though. If it’s to hurt big null groups, then no. If it’s to hurt smaller groups then yes.
---
Damnit... my plot is foiled... and I would have gotten away with it too if it wasnt for you capsuleers!
---
They alpha account is meant for a trial but with between 35-90 hours of work you may be able to buy a month. Then it is just 20 hours of work per month to cheap your subscription.
---
Honestly if you like the game and think you will play it, do some work for £8. Then you can keep subbed with in game currency.
---
I love how goonies get angry about using -ies and signing forum posts... I won't pretend to understand why that is so important
---
In the mission description there's a little faction logo that says what the rats will be. Use in combination with eve-survival or UniWiki info to know how to fit.
---
Tehe.
---
&gt; Notably, it seems to INCREASE mining capabilities while seriously reducing drones and hull 
---
CODE sperg intensifies.
---
I'd also argue there's a difference between `rents out` and `rents` but I understand it's a complex topic to grasp.
---
Still watch those videos
---
Is your corp say, hunting signal cartel members actively all the time? That sounds like a good reason to set a group or even an individual to red as an otherwise neutral corp.
---
What is your corp name?
---
&gt; Now Yulai has become something to remember?
---
Huh?  Context please.
---
Someone call Alex Jones
---
It would be nice if the Triangles go scorched earth on all the structures in a system with an active incursion.  All the dead towers die their final death.  The one man corp upwell structures get wrecked.
---
That guy in the one man corp shitting up HS with refineries or w/e just so he have a place to call his own should either have to watch it go down in flames or hire mercs to defend it.
---
Corps with more than a few bodies should actually have to work to defend their stuff.  If they cant, they shouldnt have a fucking starbase in the first place.
---
Yea that is true they should focus on getting new People and letting them stay and some more marketing
---
I mean you don't have to be an angry neckbeard to see this is obviously timed to increase numbers at the end of a quarter.
---
I also want to know this
---
the only way to save for the next purpaladin !
---
Pics or it didn't happen and you are just a delusional loser... because let's face it, you are bitching about being pushed around by one of the few pacifists groups in this game.
---
Of course there's nothing wrong with losing. If you never lost you could never grow and learn. But CVA does it hand over fist to the point they have to ban certain ships because they won't teach their pilots how to pilot them smartly.
---
Not angry, just disappointed.  
---
Dunk Dinkle for CSM!
---
Not if it's being hosted on Thunderdome.
---
NC. have significantly more supercaps than PL.
---
Its not too late! New SoE ships would get lots of capsuleers excited.

I did say, I realized my Jag was actually a wolf in my post :)

So if we miss today, we can pick them all up as long as we login 16 times over the period?
---
got to feed the ego somehow
---
just proves how drunk i can get.
---
I left about 3-4 years ago just as they rebranded the CFC to Imperium. I still can't understand why.
---
Hey man, we can either find ways to shake things up, or find ways to do the same old same old. At least they are doing something.
---
Well now I've seen everything. Signal Cartel has mined their first grain of salt without firing a single shot.
---
Hard to see since it is pretty dark [but it's here in RED](https://imgur.com/a/P1CjLYr)
---
Could you please stop cumming all over my reddit?
---
Yeah fuck alternative income methods lmao, everybody should just stick to multiboxing 20 rorqs under a titan umbrella like REAL Eve players!
---
Haha, take that KrAbS!!!
---
This is actually good news, the people that sold were investment banker types.
---
Lol you're so cute. My suggestion to you would be to watch some suitonia videos on youtube, his earlier videos basically taught me how to fly And how to think when playing.  And anyone who can teach you exploration, as I bet that'd be your best money maker as a solo new player.
---
experiment and find your own way of fitting that matches how you fly
---
or look on zkillboard.com just know that you're looking at people who died, so their fits might be terrible
---
You can shorten that to "Politicians are Corrupt" trolololol
---
Hit the MJD as soon as you land, you shouldnt get  killed in the 10 seconds it takes to jump off
---
As I know, it will stream by CCP, I have info that they will organize it. In case they wouldn’t, maybe I will organize text updates, if it’s really interesting for other community
---
You can play with fits out of game with PYFA, and the developers are great about keeping it updated - an update just went out today. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bjxjsn/pyfa\_292\_sisi\_updates\_with\_new\_trig\_stuff\_is\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bjxjsn/pyfa_292_sisi_updates_with_new_trig_stuff_is_out/)
---
Butseks.
---
ahhh, yeah i couldn't see that on my cell phone.
---
Good advise for anyone running a small corp.
---
Dont fuck with signal cartel
---
Dont fuck with black frog
---
Super basic shit here
---
I mean, that's very possible, but why the hell does it matter? Sales are timed for right before Christmas - is it outrageous of those retailers to try to drive revenue at an important time? Or is it just business? Why the hell do people get so goddamn triggered over meaningless shit
---
I imagine they set people red that hunt them on multiple occasions. It doesn't mean they hate you, instead it tells their line members "hey, this person in local might want you dead, so watch out."
---
not all people consider ratting boring, so maybe he was ratting just for the sake of ratting
---
Yes, at least that's what it says.
---
from hoboleaks - https://www.hoboleaks.space/Singularity_1497262-1498791

---
This post would be a lot more interesting if it included any details at all. _Who_ did Signal Cartel set red? _Who_ did they hire to bash your structure, and _which_ structure are they bashing?
---
Because right now I just see a vague post, made by a throwaway reddit account, and my bullshit detector is going off pretty hard.
---
I will miss salvaging azbels twice a week, that's for sure.
---
NICE, BEST FIX EVER
---
Because they need something to be upset about
---
&gt; IP law is for normal people
---
You have -no.- idea.- how close to home this one is hitting.
---
It’s fucking scary how close this ie.
---
I prefer cool ranch.
---
What, you mean like Sansha incursions .... that have exclusive rewards ...... in lowsec ......
---
The current system already simulates fireselling assets, that’s what the fee is for. Your system just makes all alliances change their stagings to npc stations in nearby low/null.
---
I guess T4 and T5 are being farmed too efficiently without enough losses
---
About fucking time, ty CCP
---
Holy shit, I'd love for that to be the climactic battle. So much damn potential with this invasion.
---
Three of us held him for quite a while, hoping for a little escalation and to allow the some more opportunists to pile in.
---
*shitposting intensifies*
---
LMAO YEAH TOTES
---
I can't see a reduction in supply helping the prices of trig materials/ships/modules etc though
---
Personally I don't like the solution being NPC clean up crews. Players like me are more than happy to do it,but can be unable to due to time restrictions such as having a job.
---
[hmmm &lt;3](https://i.imgur.com/yBlgWqX.gif)
---
Money considerations.
---
Yeah that is a really cool video. One of the reasons I'd like to try flying the navy omen. Curious how it would compare to all the kiki's flying around these days
---
Everyone dies, just look for the fits used by people that have a good record with that ship.
---
Nice try Eve.
---
Still not re-installing.
---
Setting red just warns their members not to explore with you in system, because you are probably hunting them. I sometimes hunt explorers, and while I have signal set to +10, I wouldn’t be surprised if they set me red just as a warning to their members. 
---
Neutral just means that they won’t help anyone shoot anyone else, directly or otherwise.
---
Or you could just give 30% of asset safety to the corp that did more damage to it on the hull timer.
---
Sit back and watch the map burn.
---
&gt; There is almost no reason for each account to have 3 character slots
---
If you're not using the extra slots, filling them with basic cyno guys is always going to be useful if you're joining a non-highsec corp. Having a spare dude you can switch over to to light cynos can save heaps of time for moving caps, or doing logistics. 
---
Every jump you don't have to move a guy to light a cyno saves heaps of time, especially with jump freighters. Be a useful member of your corp, have cyno dudes!
---
Please come back so you can prove how elite and adaptable you are))
---
IT USED TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW MUCH LP I HAD ACCRUED IN A PARTICULAR INCURSION IN THE JOURNAL.   THAT FEATURE IS GONE AND NEVER REINTRODUCED IN THE AGENCY.  0/10 would do again.
---
Same
---
The only real good way to understand how or why to fit your ship you have to understand what you are doing with it. And the best way to do that is to get in it and fly it into situations. Remember what screwed you and caused you to die and then adjust the fit or how you fly it to avoid that in the future.
---
Yeah, those building materials are getting pretty expensive. From doing a few 3s, even looting most of the cans, you don't really seems to get a crazy amount on average.
---
Then you would only have the big guys kill the small guys. Not really interesting fights.
---
CCP did say in the information post that everything will be in Russian, not English.
---
"May be targeted for their cargo." More like will be targeted for their blingy as fuck modules.
---
Yea I didn't think of that. Good call.
---
It's all cargo in the end.
---
As a fellow signal cartel member the standings are meant to show us people that might be hostile towards us. Generally from people that like to hunt us.
---
The current FOBs cause enough shrieking  and do nothing more than stopping people mining and missioning for a few weeks.

---
Would you be so kind as to share your hawk fit?
---
Like I’ve said before, it’s a good time to stack up on abyssal mats specially the crystalline isogen, but I’ll be swimming in isk soon anyway heh :)
---
Here is what I wish I had been told when I started: In EVE, every ship has a role. Check the role bonuses on the ship to see what they do. When you know what you want to do, you can narrow down the best ship for the job.
---
If you are interested in combat daredevils are good. I like the daredevil as well, it's role bonuses are great and it's also beautiful :D
---
But for example, if you want to explore relic and data sites, daredevil is not good.
---
So your ship choice will be very situational
---
More like turn their whole shit into cargo loot ;)
---
ok
---
Are you sure it wasnt shadow cartel? I know they're mostly dead, but that sounds more plausible
---
A VOLTA Drek fleet was dropped on in BDA space. PL flashformed triangle team to join the fun. SNUFF also appeared in Legions.

---
A last vestige of the $10 bond.
---
Multiple characters training on the same account is something you should only do once you've got a plan for what those alts will do (generally as planetary production, industry alts, faction warfare alt, neutral hauler, etc). And even then, it's often just easier to pause the training on one and start it on another. 
---
Additional characters are not something you should worry about right now, give it a few months and start to think about how those extra character slots would be useful to you.
---
It's not that much more expensive to start paying for/plexing a second account. And, generally, far more useful. You can only have one character per account logged in, but you can login as many omega accounts as your machine can handle. 
---
It's also difficult to share items, bookmarks, and ISK between characters on the same account.
---
It used to be much more useful to have extra characters on the same account, but that was back when you couldn't remap your skill attributes.
---
The only real advantage to having multiple characters on one account is that it's cheaper to keep them operating once you've got them to the place you want them to be (getting them to that point is the hard part).
---
So this is definitely my worst market speculation so far. I bought the ships stupidly early on (190/praxis, 32.5/Gnosis, 8.7/Sunesis) and watched the prices collapse. They recovered a bit, but not enough (88/Praxis, 32/Gnosis, 7/Sunesis). I didn't sell because CCP said they were releasing SoE ships. I also probably should have sold when someone else sold their stash a few months ago. #CSMLeaks
---
Lessons learned:
---
Wait for prices to collapse before buying.
---
SoTC ships are terrible investments because they will be released every year. 
---
Don't trust CCP's word in a Devblog.
---
Oh well. Time to find something new to speculate on!
---
It’s ok my man, every bad investment is a lesson.. You might have lost 8.7bil but if you go ahead, have fun and welp all that shit, the cost of that is gonna be priceless.
---
Might be the chance to double down!
---
Well, plural rewards. Not a token bpc that most people cant afford.
---
Prob just Stainguy alt trying to get that lowsec gate
---
Seems like you guys had loads of fun
---
I hope they actually spawn a big invasion force, so it won't be just another farmable event.
---
For now try not to decide on ships based on what they look like but rather what they can do. For you at this very moment a daredevil is just an overly expensive loss mail. And you will likely learn nothing from the first few deaths. Be patient and start with cheap ships.
---
Not sure about null sec but - I think for High and Low sec removing asset safety will just upset many people who started playing in the last few years.
---
CCP decided to ditch the 'HTFU' attitide a while back and instead make eve appeal to the lowest common denominator with things like link changes/ecm etc. 
---
Asset safety is just an extension of the pussification of eve.
---
Thanks to everyone for your feedback on the audio and UI - We've made some more touch ups to make colours of the teams easier to see, and I've done some stuff to give our editor better quality sound to work with!
---
except rigs
---
Except I already said you should have a 2nd account for your Cyno alt. That way you can move your main around. So if the corp needs Cynos lit, you can log that one in instead of logging out your main.
---
Looks like a fun fleet comp to do in an event or spectre fleet, just saying

We have exactly one corp currently set to red in our standings. It is a corp that has wardecced us the last few weeks since Katia's statue dropped in Saisio. As our members have been making frequent trips to "hug" the statue with fireworks, we decided to set this corp to red to give our members a heads up of the presence in Saisio of any wardeccers during our visits there. Signal Cartel is pretty much constantly wardecced, and we don't pay much attention to it. As explorers, most wardecs affect us very little.
---
Signal Cartel does not aggress in any way, including via use of third parties. We have never done so nor will we ever. It goes against our strict neutral policy and everything we stand for. Apparently someone is trying to take advantage of this situation. \*In EVE Online? Are you kidding me?\*  :-)
---
Our members are clearly instructed to not engage war targets with the intent to do harm. They are also to not show any form of disrespect. If any of our member's interactions seem contrary to our neutral policy, don't hesitate to reach our to our leadership team. We take such things very seriously.
---
In the meantime, we will continue to act in good faith.

EDIT: fixed a typo
---
I’m winning at EVE and what is this?
---
There's practically no cost for activating it cause you could just pop it open in a cheap fit T1 ship and run away to reship for something infinitely superior.
---
Yeah for sure. I'm just saying that having the empty slots have cyno guys is extra helpful when you can swap guys around. If you have all 3 slots on a cyno account, that's 3 jumps you can do without having to move any people, which is super useful in logistics settings.
---
As an example, I have a JF chain that goes from Delve to Jita, through 8 jumps, and it takes me like less than an hour to go end to end because I've got a cyno alt at each stop. I jump, log out the cyno guy, log in the next one on the same character and jump again, all the way up the chain.
---
It's by no means something everyone should consider, but if you've got the empty slots there and enough ISK for a single skill injector it's a useful investment.
---
not my tears, i'm a wormholer for this exact reason. if i had to play in null i'd uninstall.

Do you have a source for this too? A lot of that sounds like utter bullshit.

Some people, particularly older players who made fucktons of isk courtesy of CCPs many market fuckups throughout the years, would consider 32b to be a rather small drop in the bucket.

---
So ridiculously happy for this to come back!!
---
Sansha Incursions have been the same since mid-2012, that's nearly seven years now. Grinding them gets the job done with regards to making ISK, but it does get boring after a while. I haven't done them in a while, but a year ago I could probably list every single site, wave, and NPC varieties by heart.
---
A new set of incursions would definitely be welcome by the whole Incursion community if the groups I fly with are anything to go by. Games that don't add new content at all die eventually. So I wouldn't say that Sansha Incursions 'should be enough'. Especially because they aren't AFK-able like null anomalies.
---
Damn that’s a lot, I scooped up about 30bil worth while  it was under 200k and now that it dropped back around that price again I’m gonna scoop up like 5bil ish  worth since that’s the only liquid isk I’ve got at the moment, pretty sure gonna double my isk from this investment by the end of the month, what the OP said + the new ships coming out, I could imagine the prices going up to at least 350-400k minimum..

You didnt expect me to share the fit?
---
That and I am pretty sure there is already a CNN.

You just replied to it
---
Nevermind
---
Good, it's been risk free (if you do it some low traffic HS at least) for too long.
---
"You're my boy Blue!"
---
Just give the trigs San entire quarter of null, shake things up a little
---
&gt; "We live in fucking Delve, again? WTF"
---
Also they nerfed the mystic ammo tracking which also nerfs it indirectly
---
&gt; but big alliances have a harder time squeezing isk out of the process.
---
idk but goons seem to be doing pretty well out of it for both member/alliance profits, like it's not as great as it was before for alliances - but these days if you aren't empowering your members to make loads of money you are going to have problems.
---
To be fair it was an obvious typo. SoCT are given away as fast as ccp can make them, and the art had SoCT ships not SOE.
---
They need to get someone that actually runs missions on board.
---
For example, once in a while, I run transport mission as a way to grind reputation.  What I'd like to see is *all* that transport mission, all levels, that are nearby (nearby defined by me, sorted by distance or be distance from route).  I'd like to filter out the ones I'm not currently able to get.  I'd like to filter down to just one faction or alliance (depending on what rep I'm trying to grind).  I'd like to be able to filter a few corps in, but not the whole faction -that kind of thing.
---
I'd also like to see what the nearest storyline agent is, so I can pick an area that has a mission that alt can actually do - nothing like bringing a dst up and running transport missions and then getting a mining or worse a combat mission for the storyline mission...  some of my alts aren't going to be able to manage a lvl4 combat mission by themselves, creates a huge hassle or tremendous lost rep opportunity.
---
Other scenarios have other requirements - but overall, yeah the current Agency interface is clearly inferior to the old Agent Finder.
---
Explain why it’s a shit fit
---
Do this plz
---
ignore the dude, he's just parroting the edgy "everyone is out to dunk on your 7m isk frig kid lololol" line

BETTER, we said, not worse.
---
I still have it in my journal
---
I would if I had a computer. But I don't and won't be able to afford one for another 6-8 months. So lol oh well
---
If I can book mark pages im all for it.
---
EVE circa 2007 might have provided such a sight, though they’d probably be dual rep blaster Eos instead :)

That has all the Eve soundtrack songs. It's great background noise while doing other work.
---
It does not have a range bonus... will be just as terrible as the other crappy trig cruiser.
---
What I wanted to see... a ship with T2 resists that had good projection at 40km; that could be on a grid with a capital ship and wait for it ... 50mn.
---
Tell this 2 year old newbie of this massacre
---
I mean, if you look at it only from the DPS perspective maybe, but they also have smaller sig, warp faster, have better tank, and are most likely more agile and have t2 resists. It also gets the ADC making it hard to alpha, especially in fleets.
---
In terms of tanking ability, it is most likely going to be far superior to the drekavac
---
EVE has sound?
---
Maaaannnnnn I hope this turns into Sansha Incursion style game play. Dank isk made even more dank.
---
Small guys don't pay as well.
---
I guess I need to remove the old and reinstall the new. It's all messed up with the new one. The fit I copy to the clipboard from in game gives some pretty big difference in DPS and cap from in game to Pyfa.  Like stable in game (and I've used it forever to know this is true) and 15minutes in Pyfa even when shutting off some modules I can't get it to work out. Also range is different on large projectiles than it shows on the in game fit. Odd. Even with a all 5 character I don't get what is shows in game for dps, range, and cap. With the in game being much larger.
---
Stack-able means the modifier can stack with other modifiers in its category lol.
---
Miss you too buddy, I will come back in some capacity after I finish my degree &lt;3
---
Wormhole exploration without cloak is still way better than null exploration without cloak. 99% of the times you die, it’s in a site, where cloak doesn’t help much anyway.
---
Well there is the total concord incursion LP you actually have but there is also the LP that has yet to be paid out i'm talking about the latter.
