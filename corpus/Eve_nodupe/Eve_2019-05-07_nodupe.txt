I'm pretty surprised that a frigate can put out enough DPS to break a VNI. Thanks for the vid and reply. Learn something new everyday.

---
the masses always wanted to krab, don't delude yourself
---
Bots in FRT space?  Say it ain't so
---
We can't. That's why botting and bot-aspirancy are punished the same in the Code. The bot-aspirants camouflage the real bots and are guilty of enabling them. Also likely to devolve into full-blown bots.
---
Log off traps, and waiting in an empty system next door with a timer
---
Why?
---

---
I'm not arguing that everything should be a gimme but I do think that Eve is grind-heavy. Most people need to orbit a rock or a haven for a bunch of hours each week, and that's just fucking boring. Especially considering that we're paying a subscription to do it. Abyssal sites are a step in the right direction, and loyalty points from faction warfare would have potential if lowsec wasn't dead, but by and large most people are stuck with the grind in one form or another.
---
I play this game to shoot shit. I get that pve is a necessary evil to provide value to the ships we blow up but I also think it's fair to try and minimize how much time you spend on boring and meaningless shit -- at least *actively*. So from that perspective I've got empathy for the AFK ratter.
---
I'm still going to pop his VNI if I get the chance but I wouldn't say he *deserves* it.
---
Sorry to crush your dreams, but the kind of roleplay you're looking for really doesn't work too well for the meta. The closest thing to "policing" is to join a highsec pirate corp, gank miners, and demand mining permits (which are scams). If you still want to be devoted to Caldari roleplay, you can try joining faction warfare.
---
Absolutely look for a newbie-friendly corporation though. If you find that faction warfare isn't your thing, there's plenty of nullsec corps who are eager to let you join. Looking at your Reddit activity, you can try joining us at [Dreddit](http://www.dredditisrecruiting.com/), though there are other newbie friendly corps too, like Brand Newbros and Horde.
---
Krabit is the Russian word for ratting, so now all the cool kids call money grinding krabbing, and the people performing such carebeary acts krabs.
---
Fuck acronyms I'm laughing my fucking ass off. Thanks for that!
---
Dave, stop pretending it isn't something you chance upon.  Roam an area for a two weeks and tell me you can't identify all the possible botters in that area.
---
If you can't, you're one of the few people on earth who can't.  The rest of us identify them and often times kill them as the threads here frequently demonstrate.
---
Its just you dude.
---
If I could get similar ticks running a site actively in a battleship blitzing rats with blasters I'd totally do this.
---
The game runs on 2 second ticks though, could flag a fast player as a bot for mashing commands through keyboard shortcuts
---
I've found 2 mins works for most frat bots. Northern bots seem to be closer to 5 mins. Carriers/supers mainly 8.
---
Similar experiences?
---
do something you enjoy. whatever is fun to you in eve , make sure you do that . everything else is shit

Pure gold.
---
Hey there, welcome to EVE!
---
For the basic "tech 1" ships, which are the ones that populate the center of the [ship tree](https://i.imgur.com/S0WVS4f.png), you need to advance to level 3 of a certain ship type to be able to train the next one. For instance, if you wanted to train Caldari Destroyer, you would need to train Caldari Frigate to 3 first.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3lmng9/thinking_about_hiring_adult_entertainment_in_eve/
---
Ok, thanks. That makes a lot of sense. One more quick question: I know the Merlin is a combat ship, the Heron is for exploration, but I was wondering what the Bantam specialises in. It says it gets a bonus to "Remote Shield Booster", which I assume is something that lets you boost your allies shields (but I don't have one yet). Is that the case, or should I use it as a mining ship?
---
Some skills require you to train other skills before you can use them.
---
You can check skills' requirements by opening the information window of the skillbook, in the same way you can with ships or modules.
---
The Bantam is a tech 1 logistics frigate. Logi ships are basically the healers of EVE. In larger fleets, you bring a proportion of your main DPS ships as logi ships to heal them when they start taking damage. For a mining ship, you want to stick with the ORE ships. You should have access to the Venture as an alpha, which is a fantastic beginning mining ship.
---
You earned this.

One who aspires to be like a bot, such as the AFK VNI you mentioned. http://www.minerbumping.com/2017/09/avoid-even-appearance-of-botting.html
---
ratting VNI are all paper tanked if you shoot it with the right damage type (massive resist hole )
---
yes
---
Started playing this game 10 plus years ago. Wish I wouldve kept playing
---
Yea, that's what I thought. Just wish I had people to play with... I'll keep going through the tutorial missions (already done about half of them). One last thing: How do you get money out of exploring? I've seen people say you can sell the info of where stuff is or something but I can't work it out.
---
Well it used to be called “jewing” but that doesn’t really swing in 2019, and krabbing fits the activity incredibly well.
---
Others have already answered the question but to add to it, right-click and show info is very useful. 
---
There will be a requirements tab for anything that needs skills to use which will show you the minimum required skills to use it and (as you progress to more advanced shit) the skills required to train those skills.
---
Welcome to EvE! Finding a Corp is a good way to speed up your learning phase.
---
Screw that. I want a built-in Netflix client.
---
Who?
---
Exploration mean scanning down and running relic and data sites. These spawn randomly everywhere (except in Jita), and in them there are containers. Play a mini-game with the container, and if you win you can take the loot out of it. If you lose twice, it explodes and you get no loot. Here is the EVE University page on exploration https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Exploration
---
Always look at the requirements of the skill you're wanting. It'll tell you what prerequisites you need and how long it'll take to train them. All tech 1 ships require you to have the lower class of ship to 3. So Frigate to 3 gets you to destroyer, destroyer to 3 gets you access to cruiser, etc. Good luck! Fly dangerous :)
---
Yall need alwaysontop windows
---
You have a shitty attitude, homeslice
---
I would prefer Waifu over Fursona :P
---
When you explore, you find data and relic sites. In those sites, there are containers you hack or analyze (respectively) and then once you successfully get into them, you can take the loot. Usually there's 4-6 "cans" at a site that you can play the minigame to access.
---
Hisec is a very bad place to make money exploring, sadly, since there is a lot of competition and the loot isn't very valuable. Your best bet is going into a wormhole which is a whole different can of worms and I wouldn't recommend it to a newer player.
---
Hey you fixed it
---
Not quite a spreadsheet god just yet :P
---
Also, if you want people to play with, add me on Discord (Aimsucks#0001), my corp is [always recruiting](http://dredditisrecruiting.com/) (it's kind of a meme on this subreddit). We'd be happy to help you learn the game.
---
lol yep
---
Anybody has a link to that video of konkorden made in paint with those gankers dying gate and everything ? iirc there's some catalyst dying with logi going down with it and lot of bzzt and "K O N K O R D E N" sounds etc ... It's been a long time and I can't remember everything but it was a popular meme for some time I think ?
---
I tried googled it with no avail so far.
---
It’s never too late to jump back in.
---
If hyperspatials are wrong, I don't wanna be right.
---
The faction, backround and whatever corp you run mission's for is practically meaningless. 
---
But you can join the Caldari Militia and fight in Faction Warfare for the State... there are several different corp styles, I'm sure there is an RP focused one.
---
Ok, then for an extra $15 bucks or so you can afford to whelp a dozen assault frigs or a couple of fairly blingy HACS or t3s just having fun or playing stupid and then you never have to farm at all.
---
Black ops leshak plox
---
No where near. I've gotten 11-17 minutes. What systems you go to?
---
Looks like that's the X47 battle. Quick Google search turned this up.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEXMoEveAco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEXMoEveAco) 
---
I'm sure there are others. There were some Twitch streams covering it, with commentary and everything.
---
Yeah? Plenty of highlights and what not (I can link a few if you want), but very, very few people have the entire fight recorded because of 32-bit client ram limits crashing everyone. We weren't just pushing the limits of the server with that fight, but our game clients as well. 
---
Most of the people who *did* manage to record most of the fight also didn't have effects or turrets turned on, so you couldn't see people shooting each other, and also had a TON of ship models popping in and out of existence.
---
Technicly its always the "new map" untill either another newer version comes out, or untill the old map is completely phased out.
---
Player adaption is also a bit low I'm guessing, hence they have the "Try new map" as the default version. Get those new players straight into it without telling them that the "old map" (which has better functionality) is there.
---
Its a bit of a scumbaggy way to force it trough, but if you need to fix the numbers. Then once "Player adaptation has reached our goals" (Even if that was reached by defaulting to the new, worse map) they can give a deadline when the new map is phased out completely.
---
Just right click on the neocom icon and disable blink, same as any other icon. I removed it from my sidebar and haven't seen it since.
---
I was thinking more like in-game Netflix billboards. Kind of like the old car/drive-through cinemas, except in space, with spaceships. Instead of an entire fleet ship spinning for 30 minutes while waiting for a Ansiblex timer to count down, FC can gather everybody outside the keepstar and play an episode of The Simpsons or something.
---
Could probably go through the entire series in a month, given how much time we're forced to wait for uncontested structure timers these days.
---
Command ships were my favorite. Command Ships and all supporting skills were trained to 5. Didn't they end up totally fucking pointless?
---
What were the discounted skins from the 2nd of May through the 6th? I totally missed them

---
Very helpful, thank you!
---
Come back!
---
I didnt see anyone mention it, but where it shows "My Skills" is a Dropdown, you can select All skills, and then they will be there.
---
at the bar sp this shouldn't get lenghy
---
&gt;A top level FC can combat scan, lead the fleet in fleet warps on top of hostiles, anchor the fleet and broadcast all at once.
---
that's not a top level fc, that's like every non standing fleet fc. Understanding to combat scan should be the number one priority to new fcs, mostly because it's incredibly easy and being able to do it yourself vs relying on another to do it for you is just adding unnecessary steps thay'll slow you down
---
&gt;In small gang fights you'll find a lot of manual piloting. In this case the FC is basically the same as a line member except for a few key points, such as broadcasting, or calling for a slingshot (nano fleets) - everybody, including the FC, flies their own ship. Fly together, die together.
---
if you have an fc its hardly small gang tbh, everyone should be broadcasting if they feel the need to and why would anyone ever call for someone else to slingshot? its also hardly exclusive to nano fleets.
---
&gt;Some tips on voice broadcasting:
---
don't. The broadcast window is leagues better than trying to spell out the names, especially given the varying accents and nationalities normally involved in fleets. The point where using voice to call targets would make sense is when switching from the primary to n-ary targets, since the number of locked targets is small enough to not be any confusion regarding pronunciation. The "say 3 letters" type of target calling just seems like a relic done out of tradition than something with any real benefits.
---
and just broadcast aligns, like its one button and you make things clearer, faster and less of a hassle to everyone.
---
&gt;- If you die as FC and don't have a secondary established, try and get your pod safe and warp back at range. Then keep calling targets. You'll need help from fleet members IE damage reports, if they're tanking etc.
---
while that is true and not bad advice in a vacuum, do not let it be an indication of something not being incredibly wrong. Having your fleetmates so passive that they can't take over target calling if needed is a pretty bleak scenario and will probably make getting decent damage reports from the fleetmates downright impossible. And that's before they figure out they're all drifting one to each direction cause there is no anchor anymore. The point im trying to get to here is that if you're the fc, there's no secondary and you get fragged(and nobody steps up), might as well start extracting cause there's too much to salvage.
---
my consideration's of parent's aside, op should keep these in mind: if I can do the job someone else is doing on my request (probing) then its better for me to do it in order to minimize time wasted in the intra pilot interactions. 
---
if you need to ask wheter or not you should fly the meme chariot, you don't. don't turn into johnnu boi leader the 13 cormorants in a meme chariot just so everyone knows hes the fc.all in all nitpics aside that was a decent writeup, don't underestimative yourself cause that wikl only bring lesser results, do overestimate yourself however cause that's where you'll get your shit pished in and down in tha rectal catacombs where the shit ceases to be at a stage of being pushed is where you will find the real problems in your playing and fcing
---
Made another Eve video and wanted to share it with you all!
---
Thanks! Also CCP put up a Bloody Hands rupture skin as their daily deal so I'm happy about that!
---
Ok thanks, just getting into the game. So much random lingo
---
Sure give  us another machanic to abuse
---
They said at the time that reason IGB was removed was due to security &amp; maintenance reasons.
---
Security I can sort of buy, given what we've seen how internet is and how the suspcicious links way back were sort of shady.
---
Maintenance as well. I'm guessing at the time it was EoL on the build they were in, sort of like CQ altough more people used the IGB. This truly is one of those things which effects we have 0 idea on. Just like with CQ, not having to even update the IGB (Which could have been a massive timesink, or not) could have saved tons of resources which have gone in creating New Content™ (Apparently there is a ton of old content we've never gotten to see, wonder how that is today).
---
If resources were infinite, I'm guessing CCP would have more or less happily kept it. But one of the sacrifices unfortunately. Just like with EVE Wiki for example. It pushes more stuff to the playerbase, ingame tools, using the [Insert new version of auth/access to ingame data name here] instead of us relying on CCP to help with basically any of it.
---
In short. Money.
---
America combines the corporatism of Caldari, uneducated human trash of Minmatar, warmongering colonizing politics of Amarr and cultural imperialism of Gallente.
---
Lel I don’t even
---
You also probably want to change your skill page filter to "Show All Skills" instead of show ones you meet the requirements for.
---
What will bastion do for a triglavin ship?
---
turbo capitalism  = caldari
---
Yip I was in the quite channel ... but still had to do quite a bit of audio editing ;)
---
lol, must be nice to credit card warrior. I've got student loan repayment plans that set a very real limit on how much I get to spend on anything not them.
---
Exactly!
---
The module creates the cyno, not the ship
---
Sage advice.
---
Self-destruct after 20 minutes
---
longducdong! Lol
---
Minmatar
---
same thing that bastion does for non-triglavian ships?
---
T2 resists, some weapons bonus for brawling as it is a drekavac hull and two links. What's not to like?
---
Same thing it does for a marauder, make them very active tanky, immobile and high damage platforms.
---
This would be cool with me too
---
Hope you don’t actually think I was being serious lol...
---
The smoothbrain moment was taking harbs against t2 minmitar :thonker:
---
See, this is where CCP fucked the dog with command ships and dumbass command bursts, and the fail of giving marauders bastion instead of commands. This long line of bad decisions leading to horseshit like the monitor. Ugh. Brawling in a "command" ship? The fuck outta here.
---
yep
---
As this man said, I think the closest you can get to role playing is ether being a pirate or a mercenary..
---
Yikes! Now that’s controversial.
---
yea but i was thinking since caldari are mostly japanese i think since htey focus on missiles alot there like the ijn which used torpedoes alot during ww2
---
I concur!
---
its a mix of Gallente and Caldari.
---
minmatar is more africa and middle east.
---
Ammar is more greece, rome, etc.
---
and Caldari, is generally china, japan, korea.  and america (considering its been influenced as much by them, as its influenced them)
---
Awsome tool.  
---
One issue is that i have no idea how to bring up the station ID or how to fill most of that section in. Any help for the dumb dumbs?
---
The only way to win. Is not to buy PLEX from CCP. Starve the chinese out.
---
Good god no there would *not* be less data per player. Tbh even if you somehow made an FPS perform as well as Eve does at 2k+ players in a single system, it'd still be a fucking terrible fps. Eve is one of very, very, *very* few games that are still something resembling playable at 10% speed with 7+ minute response times, which is what you got in X47 and the two other battles of that size last year. And even then, the performance is so bad that the only thing that makes you want to endure that shit is the fact that the battle *matters*.
---
Well, listening to all that guys who want to play EVE like an Arcade-Game it might even work for some. But please dont tell CCP.
---
Cute video. Industry is serious business!
---
No...  He specifically said "chicks".   Baby chickens.
---
The amarr minmatar faction warfare space seems to be more of the hotspot for role players. It’d be worth checking out the role play section of the official forums as a first step.
---
I know in KarmaFleet, you get paid to FC too. Write an aar on the forums about where you went, what went down, and something you can improve on. Bam, 100mil on top of whatever srp you got from dying.
---
Protip, don't be afraid to get everyone killed in a big ball of fire. Seriously, people will love you for it because they won't have to fly back home, just try to kill something in the process. ;)
---
Yes, pretty much this.
---
That box got unchecked years ago lol.

Confession. As a returning player I kinda liked the new map. Will try the new one next I log in.

The question is, where does the ceiling stop for trig ships max dps? If the Ikitursa can already push close to 3k dps, the leshak I believe can reach close to 4k fully blinged, what will an ABC do in terms of damage? You're already talking HAW dreadnought damage levels. Is this CCP's attempt at making dreadnoughts/caps not as useful?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As well, a Trig Marauder? Trig ships are already garbage ratting ships due to low initial damage and spool up time. Plus, most rats don't have enough ehp to utilize even a remotely efficient amount of dps available in trig ships. I don't see any point in a Trig marauder aside from purely a pvp standpoint.
---
my bro (in name), doing the good works all of us should be doing... o7
---
as below, most VNI's don't fit things like adaptive invulns - they fit minimal tank, usually buffer fit, with 1 or 2 hardeners for the most dealt damage type. In angel space, it's usually 1 explosive hardener and that's it.
---
Shoot EM into that 0% resist, it's gonna drop like the knickers of a whore on a saturday night.

A Trig Marauder will be in a weird place. 
---
Bastion gives +25% Falloff, and +25% Optimal. The Falloff bonus is moot, so that ship will be in a comparative disadvantage.
---
You can put in either the Citadel Name or ID and it will find the other.
---
Name is probably easier to do. Once you got the name and ID you just fill in what type of structure it is, Sec Location, and Rigs. Then you can add it to the database.

---
Gallente in the north, Amarr in the south, with Caldari running the country and a Minmatar minority throughout that can't stop talking about Amarr privilege the reason why they don't win enough oscars.
---
The religious nutbaggery of Amarr also fits quite well with the very fundamentalist christian communities you can find through many parts of the US.
---
You’re doing Bob’s work, son. Bless you!

Expect to see a lot more of it in the next patch because you will be able to get Corvettes from citadels.
---
"Small Change" and then suggests and entirely different system. They should just remove chat logs or some other actual small change.
---
CCP has fixed the issue! To counter corvettes with cynos, corvettes can also now fit bosons and lances
---
Given the content and changes that ccp have been making, this seems a small change (this is basically faction warfare without plexes).

That's $20,000 he could have invested. And $3,000 a year is 10% of his yearly pay. That's a pretty ridiculous amount to be spending on pixels. Hobbies like what you pointed out (astrology) can have some/much of their cost recouped if/when you decide to stop the hobby. Eve, on the other hand, gets you nothing if you quit (unless you RMT). For perspective I work as a physician and I probably spend less than $3000 on hobbies and entertainment combined. It's just that being fiscally responsible requires a bit of self-control.
---
I noticed this right away, apparently the old system was unintended as it physically will not work with a specific programming language (It doesn't recognize the '-' as a character). So unfortunately it will not be reverted.
---
What about an additional +25% optimal on the hull itself then?
---
With anomaly respawns delayed, there is no reason not to fit a proper tank now. Take more time killing them. Take more getting to the next one, you shouldn't even notice the changes. Yes, your ticks will suffer slightly but you'll have the ability to earn more because you are replacing less.
---
Aye, that would be cool )

Pretty much, it was a very old version of Chrome from what I can recall that was definitely EoL. They weren't interested in having to maintain an in game browser and instead opted to move the most commonly used functionality over to CREST.

What are some things you wish you knew before playing this?
---
Okay, downvote tells me you don't have that much experience.
---
 An Astero is a fairly "blingy" ship to fly. If you're paying attention at all, you should come out isk positive flying it weather ganking or exploring... a good fit costs around 100m, or 50 cents worth of plex. If I don't do anything to make isk while playing and just lose my ship within an hour, ill still probably end up spending more on the can of soda I drank while playing than on my ship. If you are really that poor then I suggest you put down the video games for a while and work on sorting your life out. Don't feel bad, we've all been in that boat before.
---
You made a spreadsheet for EVE and the community loves it so I guess that is as close as you can be before you ascend to the olymp.
---
Lol. You’re good homie. I did a dumb and I’m out. But i’ll be cruising around wormholes for a while. Might just drift around in a capital.
---
EVE runs at 1Hz ticks. So there is one update across all systems (servers and clients) every second. Time Dilation comes in during these large fights that pushes it down to 10% or less, or 0.1Hz.    
---
Then let's take CS:GO, which has a 64Hz tickrate. And competitive servers have 128Hz tickrates. So whatever is happening in your fight is being refreshed 64-128 times per second.     
---
A competitive CS:GO match normally has 10 players, and you'll still hear players complain about lag.     
---
10 players, doing 10 things individually, where each of those 10 things interact with each other. My math is horrible so I'm gonna reeeaaally generalize on the following: For 10 players you could say the upper limit of complexity is 10x10. For 4500 players you'll be looking at 4500x4500 interactions. Every player you add is making it waaay more complex to manage where each ship is located (X,Y,Z coordinate) what they're firing, the status of their hp, modules, drones in space, wrecks, effects such as missiles, etc.
---
thats pretty cool video :)

That's the guide. In terms of fits, I can't really give one right now since I'm replying to this from my phone lmao.

Pretty much anything that goes faster than 5AU a second for warp speed, less than 3-4 second align time, and moderate/high dps.

Personally though it would be to not get stuck in your comfort zone, and don't try to play solo. You don't need to fly with other people constantly, but having friends in EVE can make a world of difference.
---
That's the dumbest thing I have ever heard
---
Eve is a place where you can do just about anything. Sure, playing an hour or two a week will limit some of the things you can do, there’s still plenty of game to be had.
---
Try it out for a month and do something different each time you play, and re-evaluate then. Let -you- determine if it will work for you. 
---
Good luck!
---
Just try it out
---
If you are unsure, you can at least start training an alpha. You'll thank yourself later if you have already spent a month or two training basic support skills. There are also a bunch of groups or activities you can try that don't require a major time commitment such as exploration or faction warfare.

Instead of launching DDs through cynos, you can now just use a cyno ship to launch them yourself!
---
Cynos are still missing from every single preset. CCP gave them their own item months and months ago and even after this update they still have not been added correctly.
---
The funny thing is you can still search for systems by the first three letters, the change they made is that they no longer count `-` as a letter, so like 80% of nullsec systems can't be easily searched anymore. Should be a real easy fix though.
---
Which presets? D:  
---
I'm in-game, let me know in the channel.

I just said they COULD fit them, doesn't mean they get any help actually fitting them :P

When cynos disappeared after the 3 month grace period, and the pack had no update, I assumed the pack was no longer maintained and switched to Sarashawa. But I guess you guys were just unaware of the change? Happy to switch back if it's going to be actively maintained.

No.

I got back into eve in 2014 ish flying the condor 2-3m fit die and reship a lot of fun. I went to fit up the condor and it seems like it got a buff. Looks like I will be flying it again!

What's the numerical superiority required to win by swarming in corvettes?
---
Just use dscan mate. Go practice to just find people. If you are in nullsec try find blues in system just with dscan. Practice that till you can find someone in max 45 seconds then you will probably start getting targets.
---
most of the bots i saw are doing hubs....so no clue what you are talking about...

Jion a couple Spectre fleet ops. Pvp is what they do. Once in the fleet ask questions....get good...profit?
---
Barely.

This.. There are many people in these fleets that can help you out, just join their ingame channel and get going
---
There is only one other game that can handle similar loads to Eve and that is PlanetSide 2 (an FPS).  
---
They have a supposed 60Hz refresh rate, but it is likely they also slow this down in large battles.  This being said there are also severe problems with running an FPS like this, which include players disappearing, draw distance, lag, hit confirmation, and so on.  Servers, much like in Eve, are under constant improvements and optimizations that will probably never meet player expectations.  
---
To give scale comparisons this is talking over 1000 people on a single server in PS2 during its peak, so you usually had around 200-300 in very large battles, still nowhere near the scale of Eve.

Same here on 4.3 (I use Arch btw).

It's only in 4.4+ where audio now causes the game to crash because of wine's switchover to faudio.

that might be why you can't find people. dscan is your primary tool.

I would look up some guides on how Dscan works, then i'd go out and hs and try to Dscan down some people in a safe environment so you know what you are doing, so when the time comes for the real deal you are calm and collected about how you are using dscan.  Doing it like that, you'll also learn some nifty tricks of your own
---
Use d-scan and you’ll find people easier.
---
Failing that,  you could always just sit at the sun in a faction/expensive ship and let them swarm like flies on shit. ;p

---
yep I am missing those ships as well.
---
IMO it might not be a bad thing for them to do any "covert" triglavian ships all at the same time - so a covert frigate, recon, and black ops.
---
command ships is certainly a niche that they could make a triglavian ship without balance worries (like for covert ops/recon/blops) - and it certainly has the high slots to run boosts.

  If they are only on sisi, you need the pyfa sisi branch, not the standard TQ one. You probably downloaded the sisi version, and then updated it with the TQ version.

It wasn't that long ago that alpha's couldn't use ANY battleship.

While I agree with you in principle for a number of other reasons, let's not act like alpha's not being able to fly multi bill domis full of augmented drones and deadspace modules is hard on poor little newbros just wanting to try out the fun spaceship game.
---
On the D-scan UI uncheck the deal that ties it to camera. In a system on the list of anoms hold V and then click the anom. It will dscan that anom if in range. That helps a lot in finding ratters quickly.
---
Miners with teeth!
---
I've talked about this in the other reply threads. I do see that argument, and really I find the whole prospect of battleships for alphas questionable. Especially pirate battleships--why tf should you get to be in a blingy rattlesnake for free?? So I do agree!
---
However that's an entirely other can of worms. If you want to take battleships away again--do that, and declare the intention to do so. Don't do this weird thing with heavy drones and call the side effect a whole-ass change in itself that justifies it. If battleships and battleship weapons are a problem, take them away. Not just the heavy drones, but also the cruise and rapid heavy, energy, AC, and hybrid, the hulls, etc. That kind of discussion is perfectly fine, and there's nothing I would object to with respect to the structure of the argument.
---
But just saying "Bots will be solved if we remove heavy drones from alphas" and not acknowledging the effect on alphas, or even that you claim it solves bots--it's completely disingenuous and shitty, and deserves to be called out.
---
/u/ccp_fozzie  please look at this idea.

---
Like, as an analogy--it's like reasoning, well, FW bots live in lowsec. So hey, let's just **delete lowsec**, that'll show em. Even if you are someone who thinks lowsec is worse for the game and it should be deleted--you can obviously summon the mental capacity to realize why that structure of argument is shit.

Those "two" are kind of hard to come by
---
Caldari, it's like a fusion of USA, Japan and South Korea. Hyper capitalism or something. Some may deny this but everyone outside of USA knows that the nation is run by companies, not people. 
---
Some (like the OP) might try to fool themselves with "hurr durr we're a democracy so Gallente is more like us" but they are wrong and should take a critical look at their own political system. The only thing American with Gallente is their self righteous belief that they are "Freer-than-thau". Reading about the lore it's quite obvious that the Gallente nation is very restricted and is much more like the european democracies.
---
On a less Eve note. None who already live in a 1st world country sees USA as a "promised land". That's a delusion and the only ones who might think like that lives in shithole countries.
---
....wat?
---
Just listen to me and youll be fine :)
---
I mean i would rather buy a T1 frigate for 300k than go 3 jumps to stain to get a corvette for my throwaway cyno ship.
---
Lol ok youre the dumbest person
---
I respect your idea as well thought out and something that would seem to fit with the aesthetics of EVE.
---
However, implementing it would be challenging as it could be used for... evil things in areas where you shouldn't be evil.   
---
That being said, I like the idea.  +1
---
Pro level spinning is to deploy a drone, set your ship speed to like 1 m/s, approach the drone and set it to "orbit" your ship
---
Put a neutral character in every system. Seems to work in malpais
---
Nice fight, nice video. T1 ships are often underestimated. People only know Feroxes. Feroxes are good but the other ships aren't that much worse. If you fight a nearly full munnin fleet with a full harbi fleet you would get wrecked though and that influences the view on the nullsec meta.
---
It would be nice if you could take out some more T1 fleets to show off their power. When I was in eve university people stopped to like their vexor doctrine although it is very strong in my opinion. It's concept is similar to what you've done with the harbies as they also have damps in the midslots, see  [https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/BLAP\_Vexors#Vexors](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/BLAP_Vexors#Vexors) for the fits.
---
There are no evil things - just creative ones.   
---
Module will not generate any aggro to the targets so it cannot be abused.
---
Creative but way too complicited. ... i like it !
---
Pretty sure you've got double the actual numbers there. Not to mention all of these are after 3 minutes continually firing on the same target, or over 4 minutes for the ikitursa.
---
you can easily do t3/4 darks in a heavy assault cerberus with good application boosters. it's not as brain dead but the keys are only like 2m each for t4's so your overhead costs are extremely low.

In order to catch both VNIs easily use a double point Garmur.

That kind of defeats the purpose of triglavian ships though, doesn't it? They're supposed to be among the fastest, most agile ships in their class focusing on evasion, utility and ramping damage. Bastion means no agility or remote reps.

SaraShawa never "clicked" for me, too many presets and never "exactly" what you want in a preset. Please keep maintaing Z-S

Best,

The result you get would need to be all in one group so if your aoe scan hits 5 ships you should get a single result window with a single list totalling everything found and not broken down into sublists per ship.

isnt it 0SHT?

Idea feels like good eve mechanic

Come join us on the [Eve Down Under Discord](https://discord.gg/KJBD9Tb). There you can check in with other Aussies!

Using normal windows is better as if you want to scan those  'NC' jump freighters jumping out of jita 4-4 you will get a lot of nonsense.

Yeah but you don't see me going around announcing that I sell titans to both PL and Snuff. Gotta keep that buttoned up.
---
There is probably only one fps game with many players one the same map (planets ide 2) which is actually played by many people and it's record is "only" 1158 players on one map. Something that happens quite often in eve. I'm not sure how planetside is programmed but I don't think everyone is on the same node the way it is in eve.

Once you have it installed and you're set up, go to this link: https://discord.gg/TAMff7.

Also join SF Spectre Fleet ingame chat. You'll get pings in discord for fleets going up and you can also see the upcoming fleets in game. The majority of fleets leave from Jita.
---
Each fleet has a pre-determined composition but the vast majority are noob friendly so they will have a fit you can fly even if you can only fly a t1 frigate.
---
Join a fleet when you see a ping you'll be online for, and get in comms. Go to the starting location at the time specified and go from there. 
---
If you have any follow up questions you can message me and I'll be happy to help you out. Spectre is good dudes.

 Not all, but you'll be able to see where they are leaving from in the pings

I hear there  is a strong chance of bans.

Fair number? What's a fair number?

Those ships are not released yet. Version 2.9.2 was released before they even were present on test server iirc. Version 2.9.3 is latest stable.
---
Author did make a dev build "v2.9.3dev1 - Singularity 2019-05-02", this is what you probably had installed

Remember back in the day when having a tit was top secret.... titans are the new interceptor
---
&gt; There are no evil things - just creative ones.
---
Are you trying to tell me most those thousands of cargo scans coming out of 4-4 aren't botted? O_O

probably an order of magnitude greater given that corvettes are shit.

Alpha arty thrashers being used in pvp to one-hit larger ships is a venerably old tactic.

"I want to kill other players."  
---

---

---
Another idea could be to have elite frigates that point/web to warp in at random intervals in combat sites, not just as part of each wave. This would give hunters a better chance to catch them.
---
Uh, yeah, 2.9.3 is a stable production build. It's pretty clearly stated on the github project page what each release has, but if you're failing reading comprehension, you can get the sisi build with new ships here:

---
&gt;Known issues  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;When you revert to pyfa v2.9.2, it might fail to start or open some fits with an error. It happens on pyfa start when you have Draugur fits with modules which are not present in v2.9.2 (e.g. faction radiation sinks), or when you open any fits with such new modules. To fix this, install v2.9.3dev1 again and remove offending fits or strip new modules from them. Fix for this has been implemented in current development version, so similar issues should not bother you in future.

&gt;70% reduction in Micro Jump Drive reactivation delay
---
This bonus turns marauders from the stationary dreadbait most people know them for to the most mobile battleships in the game. Normally a microjumpdrive will move a battleship 100km every 189 second or, 529 m/s added to the base speed. The microjumpdrive will move a marauder 100km ever 63 second, or 1,587 m/s added to the base speed. The Golem has the lowest base speed of 969 m/s with just a microwarpdrive. Add the 1,587 m/s from microjumpdriving for a total of 2,556 m/s, and you're suddenly racing past a Machariel with two nanofibers and HG Snakes. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdspCGWbW6A) demonstrating the insane mobility of marauders.
---
The downvotes tell you that immediately questioning the experience of someone who has taken the time to write an explanation is obnoxious. 
---
You do not require computer science experience, just basic reasoning, to work out why your question doesn't make sense. FPS games require high refresh rates due to the speed of human reactions and the viewing perspective of the player. EVE is an RTS with fancy graphics. Turns are played every second and slowed down if required. 
---
"CCP's server model" is to have a linear simulation at a maximum frequency of one calculation a second. What transferable ideas do you think this has to already well established FPS engine?

Yes, but most of the people undocked and stopped JF waiting for setting up all the stuff.     
---
**Before citadels you had to :**                
---
* place cyno alt on safe cyno spot           
---
* light the cyno safely (aka being sure that no one kill it when you jump to it) ^(you don't want to land in random spot in the system)                       
---
People forget that before citadels people killing cynos where more often. If you had 1 station people where jumping out, you could easily farm the cyno ships - cyno ships that are now scattered around system on multiple citadels.            
---
In "older" days quite often when you undocked your cyno, cyno popper undocked just after you and you had to dock back.       
---
**In the citadel era:**             
---
* You undock your alt from citadel, stop ship and get insta tether           
---
* You undock your JF         
---
* Light the cyno and jump the JF as there is no way someone will have enough time to warp to you and kill your cyno ship before you alt tab and click jump.             
---
A lot have changed!
---
Atleast I'm getting more rage pings now trying to protect him.
---
Those in particular are sneks
---
I hope not. I wanted balanced existing ships, not adding a whole new race line of ships what will just add more underutilized hulls.
---
Cheers will do
---
I already PvP badly, do I win?
---
You don't undock and _then_ start positioning your cyno. You have the entirely wrong order of things. It doesn't sound like you have experience actually moving jump capable ships, no offense.
---
If this was nearly as common as you claim it to be, then Nyx-volleying JFs wouldn't be a thing exclusive to warping from stations to highsec gates as it is now.
---
EVE's server model doesn't work for anything except EVE.  No other genre will be acceptable on 1 second ticks (BEFORE TIDI), down to sub-10% speed anytime a major battle is going on.  The fact that EVE is practically turn based is the only reason it even remotely works here.
---
Lma0 good stuff

---
This is literally Eve.
---
What happens, when access to a station is disabled to a corporation with an office there?
---
Yeah, like I said I DO agree with you. If only because it's a bit weird and asymmetrical: the Domi is now effectively unusable, but the tornado is fine? 
---
I was more reacting to what I see as a problem in these discussions: that a lot of the proposed countermeasures to combat botting step on (ostensibly) non botting player's toes. But I'm generally of the opinion that if bots are trying to do it, it's not great for anyone else to do it either.
---
The Alpha program is a big sticking point on this axis, because while it is ostensibly a way for newbros to try the game, it's heavily used by existing players in ways that aren't necessarily bad, but aren't really good either. 
---
I've been trying to get my friends into EVE, and so been hunting around for alpha friendly PVE fits, and just looking at those tells me something is up. I saw an "alpha friendly" worm fit for frigate abyssal that was nearly a billion ISK. The only person who ever flies that ship either has, had, or will shortly have (as they're obviously doing some psychotic blitzing to plex their account) an omega account. 
---
Using alpha clones in this way (as effectively MPTs) is pretty much a small scale version of something serious botters do (though obviously, without the botting it's nowhere near as bad) . And it's probably the best place to actually strike at them (short, of course, of player action and CCP doing their job). If the casualty is a bunch of enfranchised player's dedicated farm alts, then so be it. Anything a newbro will want to do in an alpha can be done without fully optimized AFK drone boats. 
---
But I'm drunk and soapboaxing. You're right. Blocking off heavy drones from alphas would be a ridiculous band aid.
---
Is it possible to live in a WH with just one character but with good scanning skills?

i feel as though if CCP implemented this they would increase freighter EHP by 50% to compensate for the non-existent buff to ganking

Hi there! Got back to the game after a long-long break.

The old map has always sucked for me. It loads slow, and often lags in weird ways (like refusing to believe I've left a region I jump cloned out of). Plus, not being able to open it in its own window is extremely painful. 
---
The new map DOES have reduced functionality, but for the life of me I've never had call to use any of the things the old map does that the new one can't. 
---
Being unable to flatten the new map is the one serious gripe I have with it.

Can you remember who in Templar One? My memory of that book has faded. I’m a huge Dust lore junkie.
---
Have you set a cspa charge? I've got them on all my highsec alts and I dont think ive ever gotten spam mails.
---
That's not Chinese, it's Triglavian, the same text you see when you're in Abyssal space.
---
The text, in this case, reads "Chapter 1" if memory serves me well.
---
Knee Pads could be useful for cheaper plex.
---
Oh yeah, huh. I never realized that.
---
You can make a tornado alpha alt and sit on trade hubs for zero cost.
---
I totally agree, there are definitely many alpha clone pilots who should not be and are definitely far beyond the intent of the program.
---
Tactical supremacy is a heavy aussie TZ null alliance if I recall.
---
Look sir I've eaten many sushis in my life so I'm something of an expert on chinese culture, I think  I can tell when I'm looking at canjees thank you very much.
---
Spam jita local "pls send me isk, I am new", scam people in many ways, join a newbie corp and rat in a VNI, join a corp, gain trust and infiltrate it. Or simply and the best solution, buy stuff of eve online store and make CCP happy.
---
No, you would have to PvP well for that. =P
---
Be an alliance leader
---
Yeah, maybe. 
---
My concern would be skipping about the field with the Marauder MJD bonus. While this is hyperbole, we wouldn't want booshless Boosh-Ravens.
---
Don't know where you live. But, the last time i check in Steam (a few months ago) the Omega month was something like u$d 3...
---
It doesn't flood the market with any cheap stuff. It floods the market with ISK, that's all in the pockets of the ratters. Hey, I've got a hundred billion ISK from botting, so I'm gonna buy up every damage control II in Jita. They're 30 mill a pop now, fucko
---
I was wondering that!
---
Nope.
---
That's racist!.gif
---
Best bet would be to send a ticket in via website
---
I believe they previously said to file a ticket if your omega and cant log in and they will sort you out
---
Well but they are already in game , would destroy them been unique if they introduce other trig cov ops ships
---
Check out Pandemic Horde to

Someone talking about lag in any other game.

why would they make a event where the whole purpose was to log in for 16 days if you didn't have to anyways lol. Of course this is false.
---
I still miss the old skill queue.
---
Anyone have a phantasm fit for t4 electrical abyss?
---
Shouldn't need a structure for this

I use chrome remote desktop, but at this point a remote desktop app might be a bit late...
---
Dotlan &gt; all CCP maps
---
Find a job at CCP and you probably will have unlimited game time
---
Gud Job. always nice to see botters die. nice carrier kill too.
---
How do you find these guys? by going through WHs with null connections? how do you organize everything - like, you got a group together to kill that carrier, how did you do that?
---
I've always been kind of curious about WHs but imagine it would be very frustrating to have a hole close in front of/behind you, trapping you without a way to get back. does this happen often?
---
this man knows the struggle, too
---
You forgot it's a huge window. You can't even resize the version on SISI. On tranquility you can make it even bigger if you wish :'D
---
How many virgin blood maybe?
---
Yeah, whats the point in having slaves because god told you to, if you can't slaughter those slaves for the glory of god?
---
Lets be real though, if you use enough laser fire, theres no body for anyone to investigate.
---
Covert your isk into Plex and buy your Omega time with the interest.
---
Your shangri-la only exists due to Pax Americana, keep that in mind
---
You are being beaten by EVE every time you log in xD
---
A better question would be: why would you want to tell which of the 4 fictional races in an internet spaceship game set X thousands years in the future is more american? 
---
Also, I kinda like that your answer is: the good guys, as if there's even good guys in New Eden.
---
yes, it's hard but doable. one mistake and you get alphaed
---
Yeah I know that, but speed when positioning on the battlefield does not equal agility. An mjd does not help you get under cap guns and does not help with damage mitigation, which afaik is a big factor of why leshaks are used to murder caps.
---
Run for CSM. Get elected. Never worry about sub time again.
---
Or 
---
Volunteer with ISD. Moderate the forums or help newbies. Again never worry about sub time again.
---
Byt why? What was changed?  Was confessor armor nerfed or were the sleepers buffed? Wolf rayet wh grants bonuses to armor and small guns, confessor could get 600+dps at 70km, range/sig tank with such bonuses to armor made him quite tanky.
---
https://zkillboard.com/br/109093/

That is how it looks when you outnumber only 3:1, guess you need that 4:1 at least to pull something of
---
if a cyno gets killed while you jump in you won't land in a random spot iirc that only happens to bridged ships...
---
I've heard Tama comes in a lovely shade of blap this time of year.
---
if you live in a country widely considered as 3rd world this may be true. For people in Europe and Nort America its above 10$ per month even with yearly sub.
---
My name I Mr. FUCKO thank u very much Shit breath
---
With 80% of fleets nowadays being structure bashes, i really have to reconsider if this game is worth my time. If someone wants to defend a structure he surely will start forming before an armor timer comes out, so the long times it takes to reinforce structures is just stupid and a waste of everyone's time.
---
Get a job pay the 3 month package like 40bucks for 3 months. Dont waste ingame time chasing plex. Ull hate the game.
---
Eve 2019 btw
---
Tactically Challenged part of TIKLE
---
https://evewho.com/corp/Tactically+Challenged
---
Get rid of null sec asset safety. People will want to bash structures for the loot. Create a lust to invade space. Currently the rewards for invading are not really compelling.
---
Who pays you the interest?  The bank?  
---
And doesn’t he still have to buy Plex?  So buy plex, wait.... sell plex, then buy more plex for omega?
---
Joining either Pandemic Horde or Brave Newbies is probably the best way to get into pvp quickly.
---
I moved around a bit after leaving Horde, and ultimately I don’t think anyone else, except maybe Brave, has a comparable amount of content.
---
Meh. Even back then, everyone just added the known titan pilots to their addressbook, just to get a pop-up when he logged in and out.
---
this already exists, they are called the Blood Raiders
---
tbf the lag in PS2 was nothing compared to what can happen in EvE. the only real big fight I was a part of so far was ULAX and yeah... at some point I tried to warp and then just closed the game after 30min of nothing happening on my screen.
---
Join Pandemic Horde
---
I just moved a whole bunch of stuff to asset safety after my corp left its alliance while I was out of the country. It had been docked in various keepstars in nullsec space. So what happens now? I think I saw that it will be 5 days before I can do anything with this stuff? Will it just magically reappear somewhere in lowsec and then I have to move it from there?
---
I dont get the new Triglavian thing whats it about?
---
stable release of Pyfa does not have ships from Eve Sisi.
---
I approve of this
---
this man knows how to reach daily player login goals
---
Bots are bad..m’kay?
---
Tikle are okay lads, but join tc-kl, not exit strat
---
Joining failed wormholers who went to ns is less wise than joining an actual ns corp
---
Great video!
---
Been playing since 2009. I've never built anything bigger than a shuttle and that's only because they told me to in the tutorial =)
---
What gameplay would be "active" and non-botable?  I mean even with minigames like exploration there are bots.  The only solution would be to lock content behind clever captchas, and that would be extremely annoying for the average player.
---
I do agree actually, yes.
---
I knew at least one of you would make it to this thread.
---
Underrated comment.
---
As someone without a computer science degree, I can tell you that 1hz fps shooter are probably not very fun.
---
The FC flies, command destroyers, which have the boosh thing that teleports the whole fleet, keep at range 500, and everyone else keepst at range 1000 so they don't bump the command destroyers and boosh the fleet the wrong way.
---
This style of fleet is mostly bombers to kill big stuff with, but also harpies to kill anything small, and you hear him calling out targets for the harpies a few times. And of course, it needs a bunch of command destroyers so that one with its mjfd cooldown over is always ready.
---
Don't forget no cap booster, but hey at least he had a cyno fitted.
---
Speaking of Steam, can i link an existing eve account to steam somehow?
---
Well said, I think the main thing is the choice between bastion and its advantages vs that crazy good manueverability.
---
I use an app called Splashtop.  It works really well.  Its not free but its cheap by the year.   For this too work you would need a PC running someplace and the APP will make connecting too it very fast and easy.   Also works exceptionally well on your local network, for like taking a shit while on a strat op :)
---
Don't be a prick.  Unless you do not understand English, his position is entirely down to the fact he doesn't want everyone in Goons being suspicious of everybody else because sometimes when you think someone is botting, maybe they aren't - and you creating drama about it in local/mumble/wherever is bad for the alliance. 
---
And the hypocrisy of the OP is kind-of stunning.  He's Frat.  Why isn't he out killing their botters?
---
Do you even play? Seriously.
---
Damnation, blaster astarte and eos with ogres. Go look that up. Lolx2 
---
Marauders with command bursts? While a command battleship would be cool the stated intention of making marauders super PVE boats made the bastion a natural choice.
---
Team viewer if you have it installed already
---
Agreed
---
Awesome video my dude. What song is this?
---
I hadn't even thought of that. That's a cool idea.....
---
I want to reduce my fees on my Indy/Trade alt. I'm guessing  I need to train [Accounting](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skills:Trade#Accounting) and [Broker Relations](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skills:Trade#Broker_Relations), but how would I increase my Standings with Emperor Family (assuming I'm based in Amarr) to further decrease my fees? I'm working through the SOE arc at the moment.   
---
Can I do the tutorial missions in Amarr noobspace (Chaven?)   
---
Is there a story arc specific to Amarr that will help?  
---
Should I train [Social](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Skills:Social#Social) first?
---
I got into bashing gurista FOBs with some people I met.  Waiting for exotic plasma prices to fall a bit more but I figure for killing the FOB itself the vedmak and then later on the ikitursa would be perfect.
---
Oh, did I hit a nerve? Is it because it's true and you know it?
---
Get off your high horse. A Shangri-la doesn't exist. All nations are shit, some just shittier than others.
---
A service member had the same exact issue in the last campaign, posted about it on Reddit, and someone from CCP told him the same thing. Yes, this is legit.
---
That would be over powered.  Its far more information then you could ever realistically obtain in an engagement using any version of Eve from the past.  
---
I would counter with: How about a module/ship combination that has a role for cargo scanning.  Maybe even let it do so cloaked just to make things interesting.
---
thx fc, did we spam enough?
---
Well played ! Good vid. Killing those bots looks fun. I may start come gretting them as well ! What about a wolf of a jaguar ? I read someone used a garmur i think pretty good choice as well for ewar range. Hmmm !
---
They arnt trig though. There soct modified designs off trip ship's
---
Triglavian’s are invading soon, there will probably be new ships / overview items that come out with that patch.
---
b/c the goal is just to have more omegas. I received a mail fromm ccp that i will get all the rewards if I upgrade to omega by 20. of april, after which I need to login for next 2 days and all rewards are mine(including monocle and 1M SP)
---
Sorry for replying late. Both of you are so learned that I can't believe I could have found such deep deliberation here. How amazing the world is!
---
To be honest, I didn't know much about Yugoslav expect the propaganda words and the war in 1998 until I read your articles. The two countries, or several countries anyway, changed so much since the end of the Cold War. Yugoslavian countries are elective democracy now, much better than Chinese competitive authoritarian which is unbelievably walking back to Mao time nowadays.
---
When I was a child, the Chinese propaganda always said Yugoslav was an old pal and Tito is a hero, just like Mao in China. When I grew up, somehow I understood it’s a political identity based on the similar ideology, post-war history, geo-strategic environment, and international political choices and positions.
---
However, I think there is a huge difference between China and Yugoslav， China has an overwhelming main nationality. Though both were born after WWII and were communism countries, in my opinion, China was very different from Yugoslav or Soviet Union. PRC is formed on the very foundation of 2000 years of history. It is an event of reuniting of an old empire with a coat called communism and Mao is the emperor. All the true communists from Moscow were wiped out by Mao in 1942 and communism started its alienation since then during its localization. Look at North Korea, that's China without the reforming and opening policy in 1979 or without the unexpected death of the crown prince in the Korean War.
---
So, what's left after the collapse and deconstruction of communism? The Soviet Union collapsed, Yugoslav collapsed, but China survived as a whole. Truly, Chinese cultural core is heavily damaged by the Great Cultural Revolution as you mentioned before, but it's luckily still there. People go back to look for identity from nationality. Though China has 56 nationalities, the main one is too overwhelming and most of the minorities were assimilated during the 2000 years. The only problem is not a national one but a religious one, Islam in Xinjiang. 
---
Sometimes, I think Samuel Huntington is a prophet of modern time who foresees the crush of civilizations and identity crisis of the US who is haunting by the immigration problem. But in some ways, isn't it a degeneration to seek identity from nationality like living in the 18th century? And why can the ideology of democracy and freedom no longer unite people again after the collapse of the communism? Should we have to identify them first before identifying us after? Why can't a Law of People exist like the Rawls images? Is this a consequence of the multi-cultural world that we have to accept including the misunderstanding and blood?
---
May God guide us.
---
Could you share the fitting if you don't mind i might hunt a few as well soon \^\^
---
No you will have to log in 16 days, then if you upgrade you get the omegas to not just the alpha rewards.
---
You won't get it if you don't log in
---
Adding to the other excellent resources already posted: the Brave Dojo held an [Introduction to Fleet Command](https://youtu.be/DFRXIINWaV4) class last March.
---
You cannot lock tethered ships.
---
In short, no.
---
Got the Lord of War intro vibe there

---
Dude none of this matter when their in VNIs.. Doesn't matter how close the rats spawn bots will just adapt.
---
CCP has to take a stand anyone logged in and active for more than 2-4 h should have a captcha like thing pop up or they get logged out and cant rekog for x time. This also deals with the cancer that is cloaky camping!
---
I think he means buy a lot of Plex, hold it, sell it when it hits x price, rebuy when the price drops.
---
You'll notice that near the last Friday of the month, Plex often drops against the rise of the rest of the month as it's payday. So buying Plex the weekend after that and then selling it 3 weeks later (markets depending) can net a benefit.
---
To be able to Plex your account doing this, however, would require trillions of ISK in investment.
---
Honestly if I did that I wouldn't have time for anything else.  I'm even suspicious whenever someone says "hi" to me in local.  I assume it's a bot engaging me in a fake "conversation".  If I say "hi" back I'm going to look an idiot aren't I.  That's no way to play a video game.  
---
Here's my policy:  if there's an obvious bot in my home system and it's interfering with activities there, I'll report it to someone else in GSF but ask advice first in mumble, because nothing makes directors madder than having to deal with PvE drama.  Otherwise I do not report it, either to CCP or otherwise.
---
I hate bots more than anyone as I think they devalue actual in-game effort.  But I have to say I do think it's CCP's responsibility to deal with them, not GSF.  If people want to go around hunting them I wholly support them in doing so.
---
This. Pbly the best way to avoid spam
---
like all things in EVE, ask (like you do here).  Join a FW or active WH corp and they'll teach you in no time.
---
Maybe it's time we have a CCP member sit on top of their own turrets the first time a salvo is fired with these puppies.
---
I liken it to the attack battle cruisers. Able to fit battleship DPS guns but much lower EHP. I'm not saying fit cap guns on a battleship, but giving that DPS with a manageable EHP to fight against would be interesting. 
---
I could see it being overly expensive that most wouldn't throw around. Maurauders in general are sadly under used anyways.
---
Thanks, I've been using the Kafferton fork for months cause it had already updated to include all this, but your version is usually better.
---
Had an epiphany about tekken in my dream and found the video back : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CLkXMlWUpk

---
Quick answer: Why the hell not?  
---
What is your problem with a ship that is super easy to kill, not especially fast, has super limited fitting options and is not a threat to anything at all lighting a cyno?
---
Very cool video!
---
We're an AUTZ Factional Warfare and Industry corp of that's of interest. But definitely join the EDU discord, that's where most of us are.
---
For the record I agree this probably doesn't apply to Evan, he strikes me as someone who is just having fun playing a game. But as a point of fact, CCP isn't your friend, your mother, or your therapist. They are a business; what exactly do you expect them to do? They can't hold the hands of every single player and make sure they're "doing okay," and its ridiculous to suggest that they should.
---
100% of your corp are fags
---
CCP abolished regional pricing on steam.
---
"This spoonful of vomit isnt that bad once you get used to it.
---
At least its not a spoonful of shit."
---
&gt;everyone outside of USA knows that the nation is run by companies, not people.
---
Lol!
---
I wish their CEO was Peter Porker \^\^
---
This was well done.  
---
I liked it.
---
Countries are shit because people are shit.
---
Apparently, for hogs 2 is a fair number. Fucking lol.
---
Countries not inside EU are also affected though.
---
You know, that this ruins the exploration profession?
---
Lol you've been on the CSM for longer than most people have been playing the game.
---
Face it, you have a safe seat.
---
So my point about never worry stands.
---
I really appreciate this video's format with fleet comms and logi comms and the logi POV on the side.  Very interesting and helpful for so many different players.
---
It seemed like you cut yourself off at the end of the video though.  Would have enjoyed further commentary as an overview.
---
I think what you meant to say was, "Challenge accepted."
---
The public can be fickle. and I don't take their support for granted.
---
HS static does mean you get to frag daytrippers all the time, but it also means you need to crit it before you do anything. When your NS static rolls into the middle of buttfuck nowhere you're clear, when it rolls into somebody's staging you've got content. Not that you get many good holes with NS statics now.
---
Different take on the usual video production around here, but really liked it. Well done to you! 7o
---
Is *most* American. Caldari, no brainer. Business owns politics on "either side of the aisle".
---
Amarr = Brits
---
Gallente = French
---
Minmatar = large swathes of the planet
---
Bit of a depressing question imo
---
Can I bring my drake?
---
I live outside the U.S. Can confirm: it is known
---
How much cost you now? Because it's true. It cost almost 7 dollars now. Jezz...
---
Still... It's cheaper Steam than the CCP Store from here.
---
I wouldnt agree with that. Eve seems to be working quite poorly honestly
---
Well, yeah. I earn something like 1200 month +/-100. It's not the same 10 dollars per month to me, than for countries than earn +/3000? Month? Don't know rly.
---
The regional prices should be back ASAP.
---
God no. Going f2p at all was a questionable decision, and if you think the game's about the plexing grind you're missing the point.
---
Living in a C4 and krabbing in static is pretty viable tbh. You do what a lot of folks I know do, you sub your main and you plex your krabbing alts. I do agree bots and f2ps pushing the price of plex up is ridiculous and has probably done a lot more harm than good.
---
What about lack of gate to Stain from Lowsec?
---
America is a promised land to many, most of whom have been driven from their homes by the enactment of American foreign policy. I live in Ireland and think the assumptions some Americans have that the entire world envies them is a bit extreme. We don't have Trump. We do have healthcare. We also have a much more democratic, rational election system.
---
Not my promised land though. Iceland jailed corrupt bankers but is too cold for me. I think the luck of the Irish was being born here to start with
---
This is a pretty great thing to see when randomly browsing /new from work. Stitch is generally considered a very competent PvP'er who understands how to approach problems in a logical fashion. 
---
I am fairly sure Suitonia has somewhat confirmed that he will not be running again, but Stitch could definitely pick up that mantle and be a positive part of the CSM.
---
You'll have my top vote, Stitch, good luck! I still won't fly torpedo fits, though
---
The best piece of advice that was ever given to me, and that I pass on whenever I see this question is:  
---
Just go and do it. Whether it's with 2 dudes or 200 dudes, it doesn't matter. Just go and do it.   
---
FCing is something that you can read a thousand guides on, and watch a thousand YouTube video and you will still be entirely unprepared for the first time you take out a fleet. So the sooner you do it, the sooner you will start developing your own skills and style.   
---
Most of all though - have fun. :)
---
Hi would thought Eve would live so long... It's quite impressive for a gaming world to last so much, and dispite it's short comings, I believe EVE still has fight to last for more 16... She will reach milf status someday guys!! xD
---
Oh look, someone who doesn't understand what the CSM actually does.
---
CCP's management decides ahead of time what they're going to focus and work on. CSM gets shown what they're working on in secret, ahead of time, so they may provide feedback. CSM is not Congress where you get elected, and come into it and dictate or propose to CCP new things for them to work on.
---
A vote on you would be a wasted vote. You have wasted your time writing up all of the above because they're wishful thinking you'd never be able to deliver on.
---
I see Goons and The Army of Mango on the same side of that BR. I really hope that BR is messed up, or has the bluest donut already been made?
---
PLA is in goons, PLA is chinese, PLA structure was what we were shooting, no idea if mango were friendly or blue with them. but they showed up didnt see many of them die
---
Didn't say cunt though. Possibly spai.
---
CCP has stated that a lot of this stuff is on the roadmap, most notable navy battleship rebalancing and general balance issues.
---
They have been doing stuff together with pla (peoples liberation army) in okkamon for a while now. They have also quite a few alt alliances/corps when you look at the killboard
---
its pretty safe to assume they are blue (contrary to what mango has said) they are gonna donut up and crab as goon pets
---
How NOT only TERRORISTS FLY THEM?

&gt; *The ideas below are either what have already been implemented in the past, or idea’s that I represent. They are an example of what experience I have and* ***what my perspective*** *is on ship/balance concerns.* 
---
&gt; I’d advise CCP on solid stat/trait adjustments before implementing gimmicks. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b2mnif/adding_drones_to_the_caracal_navy_issue_wont/) i**s an example of my mindset when trying to provide balance to underutilized ships.** 
---
I am aware of what the CSM does and that they're more of a focus group. I know i don't have any direct control on what they're going to do. However, if you read my information instead of knee jerking a salty reaction, you'd see that what i'm mentioning in my proposal is my mindset on balance and how I approach balance concerns. Which in turn is the kind of input/feedback you'd expect from me to CCP.
---
Oh you're sure. You just don't want to visualize it.
---
You are the higsec/tool CSM for ages
---
I'd recommend **not** joining a big corp or alliance for that. If you REALLY want to learn PVP, go either solo or small gang (10-15 ppl). Big chance you would end up becoming an F1 monkey.
---
Check out Phoenix Naval Operations [PNX-O]. At the moment, we're deployed in a war against HC, but otherwise we're a friendly bunch who love to do PVP. We don't discriminate against newbies to PVP and we'll help you learn the ropes. Hell, I went from a hi-sec carebear to a PVP addict who FCs fleets from time to time because of these guys.
---
So, goon pets

Why would you crit it instead of rolling it?

There’s a limited edition standings booster pill you can take, it’ll give you a significant standings gain, and make grinding missions take less time.

I think if you pay attention to the name of those structures, you will know that we will help them with that timer.

In long, nooooooooooooooooooo.

Man this is the best day. There’s no other pack out there that stacks up with Z-S. I’ve just been manually updating the necessary bits because to start using a different pack would lose so much.

---
Hi friend. So....are you a friend of /u/cactusjack48  ?
---
If so would you want to go out for sandwiches?
---
What will you do when CCP continue to ignore the things you listed? Will you be able to provide useful input on other aspects of the game like nullsec and highsec?
---
Thanks!
---
Or, vote for one of the bloc dudes, whose only competence for the position is the in favour position with whoever is creating the coalition ballot.
---
The response appears to have been "get fucked nerds"
---
How did you know I was male?
---
We are blue to PLA because they have been helping us for the last two years or so. Those Mango who want to try TQ in last two years has received unconditional help from PLA.
---
However, that does not define our relation with goons. Currently PLA is the only blue we have on TQ, we enjoy fights and we enjoys friends.
---
Thanks for the fight, it was a fun one. o7o7
---
There's a lot less buttfuck nowhere HS and a lot more daytrippers coming out of there, you'll get guests through the new static. I'd rather just crit it and have some HS derpus in an anathema collapse it, gives us more time before we have a fresh one.
---
I've never lived in a HS static hole, tbf, I've lived in c4/c5, c5/I forget, and I think it was a c3/c3/null. Been a while. Null statics are fun. Not great for isk making, but between PI and hisec trading alts I didn't personally care.

Each asset safety container will appear in the lowsec station closest to it.  You'll have to visit each location in turn to actually access the items, and there's a fee you have to pay to retrieve the items.  From there, yeah, it's just a matter of consolidating the stuff via haulers and whatnot.
---
Also goon pets
---
unironically supercarriers are the new tackle
---
Why on the latter?
---
All fit with T2 Disintegrators, Occult, 2x T2 Entropic Radiation Sinks, No Drugs, No Implants.
---
So I took some stuff to a station to complete a buy order. When I tried to sell my items, however, it did not automatically complete that buy order as I am used to seeing. I did not have the entire quantity that the buyer wanted, but I didn’t think that had been a problem before. Is there something I’m missing about how but orders work?
---
Theres nothing called whelping, only acceptable causalties.
---
FCing is 1% by the books, 9% improvising, 90% screaming in panic &amp; 100% alcohol. All for a 210%!
---
Just keep on trying, learn from your mistakes and make sure your fleet is having fun. A fun fleet is allways a good fleet, regardless of the outcome.
---
Kikimora (T1 Destroyer) pumps out more dps than the current Ikitursa (HAC) between ~25s and ~85s, for the dual rad sink fits used here.
---
No it isn’t.
---
Perfect got my answer thank you
---
This is amazing don't you think so /u/cactusjack48
---
That's my point GSF or any player driven thing in EvE don't have the authority to tell u what u can or can't do.
---
CCP is GOD and if there is a bot in your system u make an alpha account nobody knows about then report from that toon.
---
What are you going to do when CCP outs you for NDA breach and publicly humiliates you?
---
I love Delve industrialist they are self starting and competitive.  Every where else they fixate on isk and trying to stifle competition.  They are the worst.
---
No problem. If you are a say brawling dreads and it’s not up to purely numbers then the answer would be yes go for T2 guns. But suicide dreads you want max amount or dps/tank for your buck. So majority of the time go with T1 guns. Especially on a nag cause it’ll get primaried after moroses
---
Got my vote buddy
---
Two fun fleets. Shame the video misses the sweet catch on a cloaked rorq at a safe just before the first drop shown.
---
On a scale of 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy our fabulous meme content?
---
Being snuff pets is great. Hy wanto is a loving master.
---
3 pilots in, 2 streams on meanwhile. And still had plenty of time to do my chores around the home.
---
to be honest, I don't even know what killed me. Was the detonation or the NPCs that spawned.. Do the NPCs even attack you or they just spawn and attack the container?..
---
I think it might be more of a nod to the Russian players
---
Except when he isnt
---
Wormhole was one of your top four items listed but you did not go on to say anything else about them?
---
It's not like anyone expects the F1 monkeys to know anything anyway
---
Is it the leshak on top can't see the diff in colors...
---
What a pleasant surprise. Stitch is one of the best PVPers I know and has an understanding of the game on a level I've rarely seen. 
---
Good luck Stitch, you've got my vote.
---
“War is perhaps the most notable expression of our existence” 
---
Wow, RIP humans lol
---
Great video. Good job
---
Get in FW, warp to plex, wait for death.
---
1. Sit somewhere in range of the various things you want to check for players. Select celestial -&gt; "look at" -&gt; d-scan at 5°, rinse and repeat.
---
2. Go to faction warfare space. 99% of the fights will be at faction warfare complexes, No need to check every station, belt or moon just the small handful of plexes.
---
3. Use the [dotlan](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/) map of the region 
---
 or warzone you're hunting to show kills so you can see where people are already fighting.
---
I'm guessing we will get most ships in Triglavian.
---
Thier hype is real and CCP will want ro make dank  $ on it.
---
Just wait we will get it all.
---
I've been told you cannot use the reactions module in a tatara in highsec, is this also true for lowsec? Is this one of those things you need sov to do?
---
I started back playing and still trying to figure out a lot. I've never really stuck to the game but still get sucked back in. 
---
So this week I sat and spun in base while reading.
---
Before that, I sat and spun as a goon and PL. I'm thinking that mega omnipresent alliances are not for me.
---
Hopefully I'll find what sticks this time.
---
Can it please not go to fucking Genesis again?
---
Hadn't occurred to me, it just seems perfect timing with the flood with all the Chinese players joining us.
---
If my experience would prove useful in those categories, sure. If not, there are better candidates to represent nullsec and highsec. I want to focus on what i know and have extensive experience with, which is ship fitting, module balance and low sec/wormholes. Ship fitting/module balance applies to the whole game, not just the areas of space i'm representing.  
---
I have participated in all area's of space, which helps give me perspective of the whole game, instead of one area. So if they need my feedback or if i would like to provide feedback, i won't just be thinking of "this will help lowsec/wormholes/this particular ship". I would be thinking of "If this change were made, how would it effect all aspects of this ship/area of space".   
---
If you're saying that CCP would ignore all balance feedback, Lowsec and Wormhole stuff, I also mentioned providing feedback for PvP content generators, which would include nullsec. Mainly providing feedback on things like ESS, Jump bridges, cyno beacons etc. Create more ways to provoke fights in the game instead of everyone just docking up in their sov.  
---
It would be a bit unfair to force a conversation by saying that CCP would just ignore everything except nullsec as far as CSMs go (not that history goes against that). Since we are supposed to represent our particular playbase/community, whether they ignore us or not, it is still good to have a representative there to provide feedback. Whether it be me, or another lowsec/WH candidate, its important we have better representation in those area's of the game rather than a CSM full of people who live in nullsec.
---
&gt; Russians get Soviet inspired Ship Skins
---
I'm German, what do I get?
---
That’s pretty rad. Never seen anything except a shader that bends the light around a center point and some particle effects.
---
What option gives you the inside view before you enter?
---
Nice.
---
We get it dave, you're an asshole
---
I would argue most likely, considering the base ship size difference.  I can’t see how a damavik would pump out that much DPS.
---
&gt;Oh look, someone who doesn't understand what the CSM actually does.
---
Oh look, an idiot who misunderstood the point of the post and vomited words onto Reddit before engaging his brain. Not shocked.
---
The chat channel "SF Spectre Fleet" is a suitable start for pvp.
---
Thankfully i'm not campaigning from a real life political position and i'm not part of initiative or any kind of headshot conspiracy.
---
More devaluing of PLEX
---
I hope you guys keep enjoying fights. Everyone's afraid of you guys becoming another eastern botting alliance. So far all I have gotten from your members were fights.
---
Can we get some more before Test blues you, if we haven't done that yet? :)
---
I'm confused. POSs are still in the game and being actively used. Why would you remove them?
---
For me it was yesterday, I battled with some dork in jita buying a module. Every 5 minutes we would outbid each other by 0,01isk. Minutes before going to bed i outbid him and a second later someone sold my whole buyorder. After that I went to youtube and listened to "sweet victory", then went to bed.
---
That's fair. Though I do feel even the null blocs want you around.
---
Don´t come in mum, i´m working with my Hitachi!  
---
I know, i can see.
---
One of their faction battleships is probably worth more than the whole fleet of Mango.
---
They help us, we help them, that's friendship.
---
Anyway, at least GFs were spammed in local, I hope everyone is happy.

Feeding is fun.
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again, I want Triangle EWAR ships with new interference and range control EWAR types.
---
This sounds like a great suggestion. I don't know any facwar RP corps in Calmil, because I'm not an RPer and spent most of my time shooting at calmil. :)
---
"a bit mellow" is true, but it's still a great place to find fights. A lot of the combat zones in eve have quieted down a bit, but it means there's more room for solo and small gangs.
---
&gt; Seriously, people will love you for it because they won't have to fly back home, just try to kill something in the process. ;)
---
Oh, this is so true whenever i am flying anything below 200M value. For the time it takes me to get back, i could have farmed much more than that. :D
---
Blink twice if you're being held against your will.
---
Yeah we like our ships that way, makes it more fun
---
But yeah our apostles don't really stand much of a chance against 20 full neut geddons
---
Thank you! It’s an original song of mine.
---
Nah, there's always facwar RP. :)
---
While they're covert-capable, I am told that what makes them truly special is their ramp-up speed bonus (why the Nergal and Vedhac couldn't have it)
---
My favourite FC! 
---
Can confirm, alcohol hepls 50% of 100% of times. :)
---
Well, you can't see exactly what's inside (ships, for example), but you can see the image of the space where the wormhole leads. You can even predict the wh class according to this image (for example, c4 is black with red clouds, c5 is red with red clouds, c6 is reddish orange etc.
---
It's also nice that this image rotates when you rotate the camera. Try looking close at the wormhole to see this effect.
---
Well, it is for Eve humans at least :P Thank you.
---
Only botters would post this. Hyperspatials are for killing bots.
---
The battle for X47 - Imperium vs NCPL , keepstar armour timer. Everything was so grand in scale. Everything at stake. Everyone committing everything they had. The victory/defeat had great importance for the opposing forces - both strategic and morale. The decisive battle between two megablocks in the war. Also my first real big battle, participating with supercaps, caps and subcaps.
---
Sounds like a promising candidate! :)
---
Out of curiosity, how would you improve wormholes?
---
Shhh. The secret of the damavik is the hidden trait for 98% fitting reduction for supratidals!
---
TIL there are two versions of PYFA.. Thank you much my friend.
---
No, reactions are specifically disallowed in highsec only.
---
So, for this "anniversary" log-in thing, when does the "next day" start?  I think I missed one because I didn't understand when it reset.
---
&gt;Isn't that because they farmed enough VNI LP and now they want to strengthen their LP by lowering warzone control?
---
Part that, part we got bored of calmil being too weak to put up a good fight. I am seeing a LOT of old faces from bebop in test right now.
---
Last time galmil really pushed, I saw a lot of old test faces in bebop.
---
It is a cycle.
---
It's impossible for OP to know what ccp will propose until they are actually on the csm.
---
Which is why it's important for us to see how potential candidates can logically address and work through hypothetical issues.
---
I thought it was a very well thought out post.
---
This.
---
And what experience in 1hz fps shooters do you have to back that up?
---
I currently live in a low class WH. While experiencing a few bugs (which have been fixed), i don't have many complaints (except for my hate of frigate holes) on the low class side of WH, but its still good that they have representation. They are also becoming a staple home of most small gang groups, which is where I base a lot my activity and is one of my items listed.  
---
In honesty though, if you are looking for candidate for upper/high class C4+, there are probably better options. If you want a high class representative, I believe Cable Uta or possibly Exookiz might be the better option as your primary pick.
---
You dont have that now with golems so why would adding trig marauders change that
---
Most our alliance fleets are a small gank size anyway. :)
---
OwO
---
&gt; I've seen that knob before
---
If the buy order still exists, it's possible that a minimum quantity was set. If that's not right, upload a screenshot.
---
Actually that drop is in the vid i believe, but as second drop. I didnt put them in chronological order.
---
REPAIR paste, don't eat it. :)
---
There are other prices you pay to be that
---
Botting might be the greatest doubt that TQ has on us. 
---
I will not say that we have not done it on Serenity and there is no excuse for it. However, I assure you that botting on TQ is not the purpose we come here, and will not be tolerated.
---
We could certainly arrange some more fun fights, but our skill points do not allow us to use any proper ship :((
---
Too expensive. The only t2 module that's worth is the siege.
---
economics burn
---
How do you feel about citadel and cap proliferation?
---
What is your opinion of rising plex price?
---
Can you list some wormhole changes you'd like to see?
---
Do you have any propositions on botting?
---
That also sounds like a tasty sandwich.
---
Yeah, I know, we have studied your ZKILL for some time.
---
Those gedoons are designed to counter your FAXes, also those ECM megas are used to counter your webbing Vindis.
---
I wish I could brought something fancy for you guys to shoot, but at this time, we have no isk and skill points to do so, maybe next time XD.
---
What is this, some kind of hate boner? 
---
I have seen you calling him out multiple times now. :D
---
Thank you, that's nice to hear.
---
A non-ironic democratic government
---
I feel ya on low SP, I remember those days. I'm trying to encourage corps in test to bring fun fights again to gangs in lower SP doctrines like corms and talwars. We used to be great for it, now we ship up a bit too often.
---
Brawling Damnations have been the wormhole meta for years. They're even still heavily used in the age of Drekavacs and Leshaks.
---
There are also subcap fights in this game btw
---
Abyssal PVP with three lanes and an Ancient Titan to destroy... 
---
Call me crazy, but i would try that. :D
---
Could you not find a color for the leshak that was less similar than the Damavik?
---
Wow
---
- Navy/Pirate ship balancing
---
- cyno counterplay
---
- Lowsec content and sustainability
---
Could you please hold my beer so I can give you all my votes?
---
We get it grath, you think people are subhuman of they don't provide free labour to a company they are already paying money to in order to do their job for them
---
They count even if the other guy does not accept the contract?
---
Honestly, you're right. The overreaching changes to what alphas could use were a MASSIVE buff to botting and bot aspirant plexing, and really spiked the price of plex if you look at the timeline.
---
Eyup, you got my vote.
---
If you need a separate color with so many on the graph already to differentiate a sub-500 dps frigate from an over 2000 dps BS, then clearly this graph ain't for you.
---
Delivery them to the person.
---
Or like dashed lines, or anything else to differentiate.  Especially since the Damavik is listed first in the legend.
---
You and me both.
---
What's wrong with hyperspatials..?
---
They’re the spreaders of zKill mails
---
And he has my bow
---
What?
---
Market PvP is the only real PvP. 
---
I do not get how you could just go to sleep after this, my heart rate would be astronomical.
---
If you want to end up on zKill, please continue to use hyperspatial rigs
---
Ah, ofc, that makes more sense. Thanks for clearing that out.  :)
---
What ever region where oil is discovered you'll find Americans!
---
**Askai**
---
found you ;)
---
Yeah I second this, I don't get that decision.
---
i'm not sure if i want all battleships to have 5 midslots minimum
---
"I am part of no major null block or large alliance powerhouse and play EVE with 1 character/account." that's... pretty refreshing. go get'em Stitch
---
&gt;broadcast history
---
As if that works in 10% tidi
---
Omega accounts only
---
Graphics must be runable on a Samsung s7 or equivalent.
---
I'd say dominion patch or earlier
---
And why do you think this is a bad idea?
---
I know right.....
---
I’d argue they only have one Japanese race. The Achura. The rest look American.
---
Damnations are the trash comp of w space
---
It’s awesome! Is it for sale anywhere?
---
For the good of all of us  
---
Except the ones who are dead
---
Casual players have been almost completely driven out by the current economy, and the ones that are left just afk rat all the fucking time and never show up for anything fun. Go roam and fight and see what happens.
---
It's not just about paying to plex. It's about paying for combat ships.
---
These are good numbers to have, but gosh https://reddit.com/r/DataIsUgly
---
Not yet! I’ll post a download link somewhere and send you a message when I do.
---
Casual players rarely pay to plex, they sub, but they still have a harder time affording much with pve to pvp time ratios being worse after isk inflation.
---
Mineral inflation is the only thing keeping it in check. Keep rorquin' boys.
---
Trust me it matters because the drones dont auto agress anyway people have their own opinions.
---
Why do you think people dont do sanctums because they are a pain to do as you need to control your drones as rats are spread out.  Havens or Hubs you just orbit and let your drones go hence the AfK ratting.  I do.agree it's not the whole problem.but certainly is part of it.
---
Captcha would be an horrible player experience, name one game that does that?  We know also captcha can be solved by AI.  Although the  new ones are much better.
---
Perhaps we should make all anoms probable rather than warping direct. I'm sure that will have an Impact
---
&gt; How do you feel about citadel and cap proliferation? 
---
With the recent changes to carrier application, its a step in the right direction and from my own personal experience, has had a good improvement on carrier's not being the end all to every engagement. I'd like to see more tweaking, specifically to EWAR fighters, but they aren't sitting high on priority.
---
I'm not a fan of current citadel proliferation and i hate the timers/damage caps. For one, it basically removes capitals from being structure killers and has now forced them into this weird "do everything role" which has been plaguing EVE for several years. I'd like to see better focus on giving capitals a better role, reducing structure grind/timers. I think low power mode should effect damage caps further and also remove tether or remove the shield layer on the citadel, so you only have 2 timers. Reducing the time between timers would be nice as well.  I want more structures to die quicker/easier, instead of just seeing space trash everywhere.
---
&gt; What is your opinion of rising plex price? 
---
Its to be expected with CCP not adjusting things like anomalies and taking years to fix rorqs. As well as not addressing skill farms. I doubt we'll see it recover anytime soon. Its not really my place to comment on fixing plex, its not something that can be fixed directly. Nor is it something i feel that the CSM has any say on. Its a culmination of many factors that CCP have been too slow to react to (or have even wanted to react on).
---
&gt; Can you list some wormhole changes you'd like to see? 
---
As mentioned in another comment, i live in a Low class WH, from my perspective, i'm pretty happy with the current low class situation. There were some bugs that i ran into, but those have been fixed. If anything, there are minor changes i'd like to see to probing. Which is the probes by default not being on your ship in the probe map when you launch them and instead, being like 30AU away (or maybe thats a bug).
---
My honest opinion, is if you have concerns on the high class side C4+, use your primary vote on Cable Uta or the other High Class WH candidates. I'm including wormholes in my last as I currently live/hunt in them which also support small gang activities, but I do not know every last detail about C4+ wormholes and would be dishonest of me to say otherwise.
---
&gt; Do you have any propositions on botting? 
---
A delay on local would be a good start. Setting local up with an observatory of some kind would also be nice to have pvp content generators where a group can shoot their observatory to effect local, which will make it harder for bots to operate undisturbed. Yes, they can still sit eyes on a gate, but that becomes more difficult the more systems that exist. Blindspots should exist.
---
From there, anoms need reworking to be less consistent and help make it more difficult for cheap bots to move through them. CCP is addressing that somewhat with respawn times, but the actual waves/spawns need to be manipulated. Even putting in towers that infinite point for 20-30s at a time (like citadels when you shoot them) would be beneficial.
---
Well they'll probably be both tasty and squishy, like other EWAR ships!
---
That's a good thing to hear. 
---
My only others worry was you doing as you did on serenity an basically crushing every one around you. The controlling half off null / the server and crushing anything that is  off threat off becomeing a threat to you.
---
Something I hope never happens here, though not like ya anywhere near doing that as off yet.
---
Hope ya all stir up some wars though.
---
Back to the old alpha restrictions? Seems ok. They weren't allowed most of those things.
---
Hate boner no I just want to go get a sandwich.
---
This was just logical, regarding the political preconditions they brought from the Serenity-Server. PLA/Mango on TQ are essentially PIBC from Serenity. FRT/WinterCo. + InfinityAvenger on TQ are basically all the arch enemies of PIBC on Serenity. As FRT/WinterCo is at war with TEST (and Imperium) and they are on good terms with all Goon enemies (PanFam, skillU, voltalazerknocks etc.) it was more than clear that Serenity-PIBC will fold into Goons ...
---
The big selling point of leshaks is that they are an anti-cap platform. Other than their agility, which is still battleship agility and doesn't matter against other subcaps, and their utility highs they don't have much going for them against subcaps. In the unlikely scenario where you somehow manage to get a battleship on grid with one of the subcap gangs that roam these days, something like an Armageddon/Bhaalgorn is way more affordable and effective, and if you want raw DPS and speed you just get a machariel, which also actually has a chance to land on grid before your gang is killed or the enemies flee.
---
I am impressed with your write up.  Chances of getting slotted in went up.
---
That is a feature.
---
is eve a fremium game by that definition then?
---
now add a 3rd axis for range
---
Of course we are. 
---
I bought my first VNI in Delve for the ISK i made in HS by doing lvl3 missions! :)
---
Dude you have literally been insulting me for 2 days straight because I won't do ccp's job, unpaid.
---
Get a grip
---
The game always ran on 1 second ticks, I was under the impression the 2016 update to refine to 0.25s ticks (still very slow for active gameplay) got pushed, but it seems like it did a weird and the game still mostly operates on 1s ticks?
---
Whats going to change in eve when 64-bit client finally live?
---
Is it going to make the game respond faster etc
---
Max 2 campaign when My friend and I were the only two guys from the GBC joining every BoB fleet. Even got a comment from one of them "Looks like our two GBC pilots are here for the fleet" or something to that effect. 
---
Also the OMGWTFBBQ roam when we were all supposed to die in our large rigged AFs and we somehow came out on top in a big fight.
---
Kiki &gt; Iki confirmed
---
For me it was the battle of UALX. To be real, the war had definitely *not* been going in our favor, and it was a big gamble to hang it all on one fight. We still weren't really sure if Goons would back us up but we knew that TRI/PL/PH/SkillU/Frat were all definitely coming to the dance. The view from our side was that was time to ride or die, and if we fucked up we were almost definitely going to be evicted. So I put every character I could into a dread (my first real cap battle) and prepared to commit sudoku.
---
At first things didn't look good. We were hit by a lot of bad disconnects that took half an hour or more to get back in. It was also pretty clear that the keepstar was going to die and we weren't trading very well with the titans/supers. But fuck it, more blood for Bob. I reconnected in time for my squad to get called and I just went for it. Wound up in the middle of a blob of supers and FAXes. Took a minute to get oriented then I locked everything near me and worked on clearing out the FAXes. I survived for about half an hour before both of my dreads simultaneously disconnected, which sucked, and at that point I knew I'd never get back into the game before the supers popped me. So I called it a night (it was something like 3 or 4am) and hoped for the best.
---
When I got into work the next morning the outcome of the battle still wasn't clear. Before I went to sleep I heard that NC and Goons were burning their super fleets down but I wasn't sure if they made it. The servers had just crashed and people were freaking out about that on Reddit while our guys were freaking out about getting more reinforcements in. But after a while I started to figure out that the Holy Meteor guys hadn't logged back in and we were camping the fuck out of their super fleets. The gamble paid off, we held the battlefield.
---
It's like GSF's CSM policy.  It's an autocracy, so vote for the candidates GSF tells you to vote for.  In practice though, they don't know for sure who you voted for.  It's same with reporting bots.  The general principle here is don't be a dick about it in local, in mumble or whatever.  If you're going to do something like that, don't spread sedition by advertising your position and trying to recruit others towards it.
---
Mint Drake,
---
I'm not quite sure what the mixup is here. It appears your friend placed a munitions order with WINGSPAN Delivery Services for an expidited shipment in j-space.
---
Our delivery agents dispatched to his location to fulfill the order as quickly as possible. If you or he found an error in your shipment or were unsatisfied with any delays, please let us know.
---
Cheers,

So Wingspan, is s corporation from hi sec and dwell into wormhole to get kills

They roleplays as a delivery torpedo corporation :)

PH still lived in the north-West and INIT lived in fountain,
---
We where fighting for control of Cloudring, little border skirmishes in preparation of 9-4.
---
during the sov timer for MJYW-3 We had a subcap brawl over a node pre DT, I was flying logi and i was Backup logi anchor.
---
The gird was completly fucked and we left and rejoined grid when trying to keep distance, our LA died and Down Time Hit.
---
After DT we logged in reformed and warped to a POS.
---
Destroyed the cyno inhib and boom, cyno's go up and both sides escalate with regular caps,
---
It was one of the closest CAP brawls EVE has ever seen and I got my first experience as a Sub capital Logi anchor in a Capital fight. It was amazing.
---
Goons (we) dropped supers at the end tho...
---
feel free to link the B-R if annyone still has it
---
Dont see you in corp sry ;)
---
U cam grind for plex 500 plex is 1 month. 500 plex currently costs bout 2.3bill in game. New players rnt reavhing that quickly
---
 Unless u truely have no job. Just pay for it. Trust me ull enjoy the game way more
---
This will answer your question

---
Didn’t know we were playing hide and seek?
---
Pretty much this. PIBC blue donutted Serenity, they'll look to do the same on Tranquility.
---
Thanks for the answer.  Low class WH life is very different from high class and you acknowledge your experience and limitations rather than claiming to be an expert in everything.  That's pretty rare and much appreciated.    
---
A question though, do you think that Low class WH space is well balanced with respect to PvE income and Citadel mechanics?  
---
 Good luck!   
---
PS.  Wormholer btw. C2
---
These are solid tips, thank you.
---
This literally never happened and you are so hilariously wrong about everything.
---
I've done some scouting, but not the target calling. I know the \*theory\* of it, but haven't had the practice. Ill try to start doing more of that.

Alcohol is already a part of my roaming fit. good to know that it transfers over to FCing.

And a 4th for application.
---
Damn sexy FC'ing right there.
---
Whenever provi got kicked out fighting for them was the most fun, since the coalition became exiles fighting for their 'homeland'.
---
People who just used the space to krab would quit, and the only ones left were those willing to form up and keep fighting - even if completely outnumbered, outgunned, and outskilled.

Wingspantt got me into Eve with his videos. One of my first corpmates was featured in one of his videos.... lol

I can agree with Brave, (mind you i'm on the other side of that coin) They are great for creating content on a dime.
---
Good chuckle.
---
I'm only saving that for the Navy Geddon (just 1 amarr battleship with 5 mids and i'll be happy). I will leave the rest of Amarr battleships alone. Would also like to see the Rokh gain 4 more launcher slots. Definitely not for torpedoes.
---
And in the next patch, you will be able to save 300k isk on each such occasion, thus ushering in an entirely new era of capital proliferation, woe be to anyone that finds themselves in your jump range
---
This is where you decided to stick your foot in your mouth. I am not in TEST. See, I told you where I live but it is clear as day, you are either stupid or like to hear yourself talk out of your asshole. Try going to complain to TEST. I am not part of their leadership. Alap try to complain to FRat leadership which I am not a part of either.
---
The worms are sone eating your brains, maybe it's time for a neuro network upgrade finally. Did you know the brain is like 90%+ grey matter? When you are done flapping your mouth, it might time to pick the grey matter off the floor and do something productive with your life.
---
lol wangspin. The mails are part of the comedy routine they like to run, they're "kinda roleplaying". They reimburse newbros they gank to keep em flying. A healthy game means they still have prey. :)
---
Good to hear you guys are still out here. :)
---
Whatever you say
---
Would these corps be good for getting back in the game after 7-9 year break? Still building the new pc atm but i am craving getting back into Malediction for duo or small skirmish lock down support. Recovered my old account which was Amarr into Min cross training and very thorough training up to Absolution and BS class.
---
Back when i played I mainly PvE wormhole etc, so noob friendly corp is the goal for now.
---
Are interceptors still used?
---
I like this guy, you've got my vote
---
Always a pleasure to know good old 'mom and pop' delivery services like Wingspan are still around and kickin' in this day and age.

---
Good stuff man. I see loads of bots on my campers.   
---
I setup bubbles to catch them on their warp back as they set my campers blue :P
---
Uh.. Generally they do.. If they made it so rats didnt auto agro and had to be directly engaged every wave that would make a massive change to afk vnis, drones dont auto agress but they retaliate when your attacked.. Good enough.
---
People dont do sanctums cuz the drones have to fly to each rat instead of stay in one spot.. Not cuz drone agro.. Its just easier.
---
Oh and I know capcha would be terrible but other than an arbitrary log off how do we kick bots? Reboot the server every 2h? Lol probable anoms is cancer "I know coming from wh space" and a quick way to make everyone mine instead.. 
---
Honestly imo ccp needs to just start ban hammering anyone online 24/7 afaic. No one other than bots and cloaky campers are on 24/7.
---

This is amazing,  we get a guy who actually knows about small scale PvP and activly participates and isn't toxic to other players.

You were fighting a bot.

One moment, squeezing out Skeez. Glazing her donut in 38 seconds...

Not at all how eve is. Pay for premium enjoy game. U dont meed to buy 600 rubies to buy better ships. U cn play the game amd gt isk
---
So I could create a brand new pilot? Can you buy plex through Steam? Do you have to use Steam cash for in-game purchases?
---
I will actively remove gates from stain, so its only accessible by wormholes.
---
That would be amazing.
---
Xi Jin-Pooh already sent the downvote brigades it seems rofl
---
Does navy ship balance include  all of them having blueprints?
---
Oh thats the just a daytripping highsec roleplaying group.
---
Maybe give it to Jagex instead of CCP. They've proven to be somewhat more competent. They actually play their games, too.
---
How is that considered AUTZ, because of sheer blob size you have 20 Aussies? Why shit on ANZA, coz papa bean says darkness bad? They may not be as active they were back in the day - but theyre one of the older aussie corps around.
---
While i can't speak for CCP, that would be the idea.
---
Also, there were recent rumbling a couple months ago about CCP doing something on SiSi where Navy Battleships were getting BPC's added. I believe the typhoon fleet and tempest fleet both appeared in the data as BPC's as well. So it sounds like CCP is already aware of it and adding them in, just slowly and without any kind of announcement at this time.
---
#lifesupport
---
I added a word, but yes. I brought up navy ships not having BPCs a long time ago.  Glad this is being addressed by CCP or you or both.

When you consume a can of quafe, it should generate a new item  "empty can of quafe" in your cargo.  The empty cans should be able to be jettisoned into space, without being placed in a cargo container.  
---
Acceptable alternative is that the empty cans are immediately generated and jettisoned into space.  
---
This will allow me to keep a small freight container labled "Yeti Cooler" in my cargo with a 6-pack of quafe. while i toss my empties either out the window / in my back seat while smashing down the back roads of placid.

Gallente = French / Greek mix - the philosophy behind the Gallente could easily be attributed to the US.
---
But, the US is pretty philosophically diverse.  Any of the 4 empires could represent philosophies found in the US.
---
I never did it myself. But I have a corpmate who did this and ha said C2 was ok but C3 is realy hard.  
---
I'm not realy sure about his skills or fit (sory my friend). But I think he had a 1MN AB.  
---
In fact, neither C3 nor Confessor was modified since a while. so, if you knew how to do it properly, you still can.

Don't be timid on comms, don't freeze - any command is better than none. Understand not everyone speaks english as a first language or they may not all understand your accent so be clear when you speak.

It's definitely not made with colour-blindness in mind, I can say that much.
---
We always just roll the c4/c5.  New sig, as long as you dont warp to it, doesn't show up on the other side for four hours.  You're essentially "safe"..
---
Owning guns in the US is considered a right. Carrying and firing weapons in the middle east is a way of life.  There is always different ways to look at things depending on who you are and how you are socialized.  Russians just to like take what is not theirs and usually by gun point and overwhelming odds.
---
Hogs as pointed out, when they move into a system remove risks, however, they offer benefits and offer to join the collective.  Its a choice and there are no hard feelings and yes, it is a game and yes we do mine some salt.  However, we do teach and we help and we offer classes and recommendations.  We do not grief and we do not pirate just to pirate.  We control what we can control. People can moving in an out of systems we are in at the leisure. We do not condone or sanction all actions of the people in the collective.
---
We also offer to purchase structures from the owner and usually offer to have them join us unless they are unusually salty. We usually offer at least three options. Like any builder, when something gets in the way of progress, you either build around it, remove it or incorporate it. 
---
We offer nearly every form of game play that is available.  We do keep the drama internally to a minimum.  However, remember it is a game.
---
With that said, there is always someone bigger and badder.  We recognize this and we enjoy content.  So if we have something going on somewhere we always have something else going on somewhere else.  
---
For hogs, fighting and Waring is a choice, not a necessity.  We have the ability to move in and out of war as we choose and we enjoy getting that PVP content.  However 90% of hogs just prefer not to do the PVP thing.  Should the need arise or we get tired of playing with people we bring in a larger majority of those people that don't to end it. If we continue to play with them that is called good content and enjoyment.  We also in many instances form packs with a lot of our previous opponents and go out an wreck other things with them. Its a lot of fun and we like finding like minded corps and coalitions that enjoy doing the same.  
---
Admittedly we do hope this is a future building for when the inevitable Goon swarm threat had to be dealt with.
---
Again its a game and we play it like one and we enjoy it and if you want to enjoy the game , without the drama of constant baddies of the politics of the crazy huge coalitions.  Then come to Air Hogs in game chat.  'You have found a home'.
---
Balance always produces predictable content - it's called the Meta, or the old phrase for it: FotM (Flavor of the Month).
---
Every balance patch, there are obvious inherently better configurations for fleets, fittings, etc.
---
Can you spend more isk and do better than a VNI?  Sure, but if you're going to start decking out a 3b isk battleship, you're better off just moving to a carrier.
---
I Vote this and the above comment as the EVE Reddit Greatest Post of the year.
---
#YOU GET THAT MODS THIS ONE WINS!!!
---
Also I think /u/cactusjack48 likes it as well.
---
The 'torpedo delivery' joke was funny like the first 2 videos. then all the fanbois joined and it's been lame ever since.
---
Fair enough. That is probably the better way to do it.
---
&gt; For addressing botting directly, i think removing the ability for local to be scraped by loggers would be a nice and simple fix, to at least force more effort on the botters to get intel.
---
THAT is a point I was thinking about since I first witnessed with a spy char, how mighty that Intelbots were in protecting mindless afk-ISK-generation. Until 2016 our corp still did smallscale roamings from our low-pocket when we had a good-Nullsec-WH. That has completely stopped. Even when you enter behind their lines through a WH, as soon as you make 2-3 jumps the alarms go off in the Region.  That is basically why WH-Diving usually only goes 2-3 jumps outside and then rolls again if nothing is catched.
---
Sara-Shawa is far superior in practically every conceivable way
---
I live in the US... it's pretty widely known here too, but we do have some people who insist it isn't true.
---
I like everything you have said, I miss the old days where choosing a navy mega or the vindicator was something to think about with the price differences (I think the navy was 600mill ish and vindi being 1.1bill ish) the pirate ship nowadays is almost always better for practically the same price as the navy....
---
You got my vote
---
that was already gone when they decided that it's a good idea to put them in the scanner window without having to scan for them to know that they're there. "look, look, super sekrit stuff right there ..."
---
Mostly it will prevent the client from crashing during the largest battles. It will also likely allow for more graphical improvements that would be too memory intensive for the current client.
---
\&gt;something snarky
---
\&gt;edit: took advice and it's better
---
lmao
---
It resets after every sown time at 1100 eveT.
---
I recommend you take combat probes out with good scan skills in order to track people down. Speaking as one who uses them, they yield a lot of success in any space. If you are a solo player I could understand however I implore you try it out with a good alt.
---
Amusingly, Z-S is a fork of mine, ultimately, or at least was when it was first released. Which is itself a fork of an earlier pack. I'm glad people have choices and don't really mind what pack they use but there's definitely more than one option out there these days.
---
&gt; A question though, do you think that Low class WH space is well balanced with respect to PvE income and Citadel mechanics? 
---
Good question. As i do often do the PVE sites and Relic/data sites that spawn in my low class, i think they are fair. Certainly not comparable to nullsec anoms or higher wormhole classes but thats fine. In my opinion, C2's and C3's are optimal staging holes, not farm holes. Most people that live in low class want options. Either to make logistics easier, or to make roaming easier. They aren't there to make isk, at least not primarily. Some low class are connected to C5's which can be used as an isk generator with RR Nestors if needed. The low class itself though is for groups that generally either want to pvp or do industry stuff. Their focus is going out and roaming or easy logistics. The need to make isk is generally lower as these groups are already setup and have another goal in mind (or have alts to make isk and pvp from the wormhole).
---
In regards to citadel mechanics, like all citadel issues, i hate the damage caps/timers. It takes some effort to coordinate killing a citadel in WH space by either rage rolling or logging off in the hole. Which i can't log off for a week, since i'm just one character, heh. That being said, WH Citadels actually drop loot and there is no asset safety, so at least when you do spend the time to kill the citadel, you get a payout. Per my previous comments, i would like to see "Low Power" mode actually effect citadels by removing the shield layer and either removing the damage caps, or adjusting it so you can apply more damage quicker to expedite their removal.
---
This one time I anchored up and pressed f1.
---
Great shout out to Clarion Call (and subsequent RnK videos).
---
I do like most of your points but the one with Pirate BS nerfs. Now I guess its more a bias from my side and  neither do I claim to have close as much experience as you in this game but Reducing usable Subcaps for Fleets imo is not the way to go. Now I know many people dont like big fleets and that is totally fine but taking stuff away from these is imo not the best idear. I am thinking for example of NMs or Machariels in this case, as the predominantly used Pirate BS in Lowsec and Nullsec fleets of bigger sizes. I have the fealing reading your idears that you want to push Navy Ships into the Fleet Role while pushing Pirate Ships into the Solo/Small Gang roam exclusivly. As we are seeing with the Barghest we can expect to have Faction BS reach around 800m-1b in hull price and only be available in really limited Numbers if your Idear gets implemented. Meaning all Pirate BS would be unviable to Fleet fights that have more than id guess 40+ people? And the Ships like Machariel and NM are not used because of there DPS or EHP increase, tho nice, but because they offer Mobility. Navy Ships just offer Tank and EHP which in big fights is not worth the extra price compared to T1 ships. In this Scenario I dont see the either Navy nor Pirate Ships be used in any Big scale of fighting, atleast not in Null. Maybe groups like snuffed would use em still but thats be about it. And I know people like to be like YES FUCK ALL NULL AND ALL DUDES PARTICIPATING but IDK man. Making T1 Hulls the only really viable Option for Fleets is kinda boring. Also every Navy BS should be able to be bought as BPC in the LP Store. Do you see this the same way or what do you think are the intended Roles of Navy and Pirate BS in the Meta you wish to create?
---
Obligatory not a wormhole corp. 
---
Surprised no one has posted this already.
---
Nope. When you click warp the game has set your warp destination.
---
I like the permanent aspect of eve, all the past history and conflicts all shaped the in game universe.
---
It's not a very statistically-good opinion, though.
---
For many years, there were no valid RMT systems built in the game, and it wasn't more popular and many, many pilots claim the game was better back then.
---
&gt; Where is TEST ?
---
busy editing seddow goku fleet vids
---
Caldari. Hyper-capitalist, jingoistic. In one of the lore books they literally elect a Trump character who promises to Make Caldari Great Again and starts a race war. Plus their alliance with Amarr is a pretty good proxy for Americans willingness to get in bed with any fascist/religious extremist crazy person if it gets the job done.
---
Even before leshaks were in the game people theorized they would be anticap platforms. Then Odin's Call and the other big wh groups demonstrated that this was exactly the case. But I guess it's my bad for at least trying to contribute to the conversation. If there's an actual argument you want to make, let us hear it.
---
Send me a DM if your interested.

Did you really have to use THREE shades of blue? This is the most fucking retarded attempt at being smart...

I've debated with this gentleman a few times on discord. He's passionate about his trade, he knows how to communicate (he even knows how to listen lmao), and he actually knows what is going on.  Please don't get drug down by the negativity and the red tape you'll run in to. You've got all the tools to make a big difference - I really believe that.
---
Supported.

Get rid of two of the blues, add black and pink, problem solved.
---
Wow - a well-thought out, concise answer to 2 specific questions without blather, chest beating and promises to force CCP to do "something".  
---
You have +3 votes.  Good luck.  
---
PS.  I disagree with some of your points btw... hacking is a completely different skill set and dynamic from PvE site running.  Especially since it doesn't allow for group work and really benefits only day-trippers without the expense of a citadel.  Putting a few PvE combat ships into an Anom is risky and should be worth it.  But currently, in C1/2 at least it really isn't.
---
Gj \o/
---
I shut up and give you my vote
---
Not to mention that you'd basically be guaranteed to reset your ramp up every time you mjd, and you can't move in bastion so there's little stopping your target from getting out of range to reset you.
---
DELET
---
He was clearly a Bot or AFK like a pro.
---
First attempt he warped to a Fortizar.
---
After few minutes we jumped in the system again and he warped to a raitaru.
---
He was thethered abou 36 min. He could safelog the whole time.
---
I equated it to reporting a crime, you're fixated on the crime example i used because you're an idiot.
---
You're the one that came out and said "HEY GUYS MY NAME IS DAVE AND IM A PIECE OF SHIT WHO CAN'T LIFT A FINGER TO HELP THE GAME CAUSE IM NOT PAID FOR IT", don't get mad when somebody then says 'wow dave you're a piece of shit'.
---
You built your turd throne right here in public, now you get to sit on it.
---
Nah, hard pass mate, good luck tho bud.
---
Would rather have someone who knows anything about capital gameplay over someone who fellatiates himself over being a '1337 solo pvper who don't need no blob'.
---
&gt; Any change favouring new incomming people is very unfair to old players - like me i have to admit -, who worked hard over the years for everything we have.
---
Basically the script for every person who's afraid of change, and when changes do happen, realize that people who come after them will have it easier.
---
As an early adopter of Eve, there are so many changes I'm glad have happened.  And if someone else getting something easier makes your game feel less fulfilling, then sorry.  Single-player games may be better for you.  Welcome to life: people make things easier.  Stop feeling entitled because you had to do it the hard way.  It doesn't make you any better or make newcomers any worse.
---
How will you present your agenda and feedback to a company knowing that´s in their best interest to just ignore it and instead focus their efforts onto pushing for short term profits by catering to the high and nullsec crowd?
---
I would say that mainly comes from very fast cycletimes of small weaponry compared to medium weaponry. I am more concerned that you not only have a heavy hitting destroyer but also one who is very fast and has extreme tracking together with good range
---
what ship would be good for that? Since I believe you wouldn't get out alive after getting some kills. So fancy ships like a T3 Cruiser would be too expensive for me to throw away like that
---
I meant one that takes all 4 faction skills to fly. But the BRs are thematically on point.
---
But I don't WANNA play an MMO. I want to mindlessly grind my way up a LADDER and then call at some KOREAN TEENAGER a FAGGOT
---
The goal isn't to nerf fleets. Maybe fleets end up costing more, but current EVE economy would not suffer if particular ships got more expensive. Would function as a better isk sink and actually make losing a fleet of pirate battleships hurt like they used to.
---
No, my original goal here is to fix battleship progression. The original progression is T1 -&gt; Navy -&gt; Pirate. Currently its T1 -&gt; Pirate and navy is largely ignored. This is because pirate battleships are too cheap and easily farmed. You can't fix navy battleships without first fixing the cost disparity. We could buff the Navy Domi for example, but if the rattlesnake is still 400m and the Navy Domi 500-600m, people are still going to pick the Rattle. You'd have to go through absurd buffs to make it so the navy ships are preferable over pirate. Then that swings the pendulum into the navy ships always being better than pirate and now you've lost a ship class either way.
---
Keep in mind, pushing pirate battleships up in price, doesn't necessarily mean they all cost 1b, they could go to  600m. In theory, the navy battleship buffs could also receive LP adjustments to make them inherently cheap as well. So lets say T1 cost 200m at most, Navy costs 400m at most and Pirate are 600m. Understandably, that is a perfect scenario, but LP costs can still be adjusted to help guide them in that general area. Is 600m too much for ships that have very strong and unique bonuses? I don't think so. Mordus are kind of expensive due to that they have a limited number of agents for missions to generate LP and there are no Mordus DED/anoms. Plus Barghests are not a staple of any null fleet due to their bonuses. Its not that farming Mordus is impossible to bring down their cost, there just isn't a major demand for them.
---
Now imagine if you had null bloc moving alts/members, or low sec alliances setting up members to hunt for these BPC's, that could help keep up with demand and still keep pricing somewhat in control. But you're now risking a lot more by the other low sec entities wanting to kill you. It provides content in lowsec, which is low, as well as actual financial benefits from hunting these things.
---
Unsure, perhaps you have competition?
---
Alternatives could include finding wormholes and scanning out relic sites in the wormholes (it is possible to find null relic sites in wormholes) or look for wh connections to other regions.
---
They guy who can grind ISK can afford more ships, and so can fly more ships, and so can learn more.
---
was looking for TEST, found russians... Is everyone from the south now TEST?
---
I run a decked out gaming rig on potato mode - it's like the classic Nos Domi
---
No, the game will not respond faster. It will consume more system resources than before. Multiboxers and owners of ancient computers will complain.
---
Historically, there's been a huge amount of undeserved hype around architectural bit doublings. The only concrete improvement is that the client will no longer be limited to 4GB of memory. However, the only time a client needs that much memory is a few times a year during massive TiDi brawls with thousands of pilots on a single grid.
---
From a theoretical standpoint it is impressive since "under the hood" a whole bunch of legacy code has been rewritten. Theoretically this will make future development easier. But this is not something you'll be able to perceive as a user, so there's no practical point in getting excited about it.
---
you have my votes!
---
No kink shaming plz.
---
Mrs obama get down
---
I think a new scan mechanism would need to be added that did not lock the target in a way that broke tether.
---
No, not about ganking at all. 😂
---
You should probably specify whether you want a Corp leader to actually run the Corp for you, or someone like a consultant to help get you set up. It’s hard to see what you want to do from this post alone.
---
Additionally, you should also specify what interests you have so far. Do you want to focus on RP? What area of space do you want to try first? Do you want to be associated with a larger group or try being more independent? Of course, if you don’t know yet a consultant with experience in all areas of space would be helpful in deciding, which you’d need to specify.
---
Damn, this seems like a great idea and could be really good for the game.
---
O2O, lost my first cap there.
---
Still, even with all the lagfest, it's unforgettable.
---
Never knew, will look closer on next encounter! Cheers!
---
A lot of the stuff that happened in  O1Y during WWB was pretty cool, like that time DBRB warped a fleet onto Hordes new fortizar which was manned by Trav K. Who promptly deleted said fleet. Good times.
---
Well it wasn't made with non color blindness in mind either.
---
Makes sense.  
---
Because none of us have played before we are mostly looking for someone to help out in the creation. I would like to keep the corp leader within the current Eckhearts Ladder Community. As well for interests, I don't not know much of what we are looking for. I am sure that many of us would enjoy an RP experience so that would be something to look into.  
---
Thanks for the comment
---
You'll vote how you're told bee #13597
---
delete cap fleet
---
You can still enjoy the game as an alpha. Paying for a sub is not in any way required
---
Thanks, feedback is always useful.
---
Its a tough call imo. I view C1/C2 like high sec anoms and lowsec anoms. They don't generate a ton of isk and as such, aren't super difficult. If you increase the isk making potential in a C1/C2, then everyone might just skip over LS and go straight into wormholes.
---
I'd like to see more people in LS, as currently a lot of groups are abandoning ship as there just isn't enough content in some cases.
---
C1/C2 specifically i don't feel are worth messing about with potential isk making. As mentioned, in their current iteration and interaction in the meta, they're more staging points rather than isk farms. People don't want to evict you out of a C2 cause they want your isk. They might want your static's, but not the isk. I like that dynamic.
---
AT was the high point for me.
---
Other than that a battle on the Querious border back when Horde lived there against Darwinism. I was FCing and I beat them in a fairly textbook way by being at a range that was good for me and bad for them.
---
Then it got really fun. 
---
I chased really aggressively, de-agroing my tackle before the fight ended, splitting tackle groups on the fly and catching ships on every gate for about five gates. That chase  was what made this fight special for me, I've never had such rich pickings nor run a chase as well.
---
Blood in the water that day.
---
Really sad to see that RA/XiX form decent fleet comps, but totally seem to lack any competent FCs ...
---
CCP peligro doing gods work. (or his own work, but you know what I mean)
---
WiNGSPAN at least usually puts a fun spin at their kills.
---
Although a few weeks ago I got podded by WNGSP and did *not* get a delivery receipt.  I was sorely disappointed, and was planning on sending a notice of complaint.
---
I'd prefer to keep local in nullsec. But would like to see a delay (show up when you uncloak) along with a few content generators around it, such as an observatory that can be attacked which will effect local (increasing delays or removing it).
---
I'd also like to see if its possible to remove local chat logs so scrapers can't get effortless intel for bots.
---
more name and shame MORE
---
Please, do it. That way we can see with the agent, and ensure it never reproduce, thus assuring a steady and quality delivery for our next jobs.
---
Thank you!
---
my favorite battle was in rakapas, the last ditch effort of calmil vs galmil.. man that was a crazy night,
---
Remove alpha accounts, or this will just keep happening.
---
There are drone space data sites, and maybe sleeper caches. The big thing is no relic sites, which is what was making you the bank in Provi. [here](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Relic_and_data_sites) is a write up on all relic/data sites from eve University, but if you can’t find sites it might be that they’re rarer, or someone hacked them all. If you can find a wormhole connection to a c1-3 hole in nullsec, that would almost definitely be more profitable though.
---
Are abyssal rats and objects now included in the overview? I had to manually add them (and destroyable cache) manually.
---
Thanks :)
---
Afaik there are no relic sites in the drone regions, so you dont get a lot of isk from only hacking. But the combat anomalies that spawn are mostly easy and fast sites in a decent fitted ship that pay decently well.
---
Cheap ships, clean clones, run fleets several times a week. If it sticks you'll end up a decent FC.
---
Also frigates make fast fleets. Unless you know you have a fight nearby roam in frigates, ass frigs or interceptors.

@Stitch_k and you will get all my votes. Also, really like your vids man.

I use a helios, sabre nd orthrus. You can probably scratch the sabre and just use the orthrus if u only have 2 omegas. If the orthrus is too expensive I'd just bring whatever cheap brawly high dps you can fly, the important being your explorer being able to fling u once quickly get the 100% ship scan. This also more successfull when complemented by other people in your circle.

Do i smell a hammering on alliances that knowingly accept bots?

That is why renting is a mistake.

You didnt mention much about FW low-sec. Is there anything specific you would bring to the table in regards to FW (other than LP store changes)?

Legit question, are these done at downtime?

Assuming a fair number of bots are operating nearly 23x7 I would have expected to see a recognisable dip on eve-offline, but it all looks quite smooth.

Hope they find a way to automate accurate bot detection, so that the bans can come swifter. That way people lose their investments faster than they can generate isk

hey, u/ccp_peligro
---
Just out of curiosity, what's the ratio of alphas:omegas that got banned, or have been banned in the last few months?
---
I'm just curious.
---
I think Eckheart does some cool stuff and Eve could always use more lore videos, so I’d really have to warn you of predatory people that would be fully willing to take advantage of inexperienced people financially, or put you into boring, soul sucking work like mining for their own gain. Also, before anyone makes any accounts, I’d recommend that you’d look into Eve’s referral program. It’s a good head start tool, and a way to get some plex back for subscribing, but it’s very easy for predatory players to not give any plex back.
---
I think many of your lovely legitimate customers won't mind changes to afk VNI'ing or whatnot that make it less easy.
---
Greater Western Co-Prosperity Sphere are goon renters. It would be really spicy if goons got negwalleted lmfao

that doesn't make me a piece of shit, that just makes me some one who isn't a goddamn doormat.

Is there anything in particular we can do beyond pushing Report Bot to help you out?

No doubt it's tricky. Thanks for your hard work.

You can recover from a bad call but if you wait too long your options will be removed for you by the other guy.

What do you think of the state of WH meta in relation to Triglavian ships?
---
Especially in the aftermath of Briscgate, do you think CCP really wants to risk an embarrassing turnabout again?
---
I'm not saying they don't have solid means of detecting bots, or that these bans weren't warranted. But all it takes is for one "named and shamed" person managing a successful appeal for CCP to have a whole lot of egg on their face.

thanks for the link! time to fresh up on this.

* Step 1: Neg the wallet of the offending corporation by the full amount the bots made in the last XYZ time period. While the wallet is negative, the corporation cannot invite new players.
---
* Step 2: Issue warning to alliance harboring. Include in the warning who the offending corporation was.  
---
* Step 3: If step 1 and 2 repeats in the same alliance with the same corporation, apply the negative balance to the alliance and suspend the ability for ALL corporations within the entity to invite/recruit until it is paid off.
---
* Step 4:  If the alliance has repeated warnings for different (i.e. rotating corporations to evade) apply prior step.
---
There is no gameplay that is completely not bottable. But there is plenty of gameplay that is active and also relatively balanced for risk vs rewards at the same time. Take for example T4 T5 Abyss, or some of the WH sleeper sites or drifter content.
---
Engaging gameplay would eliminate a very large portion of players botting due to lack of engagement. This will of course still leave RMT, alliance resource bots etc. Which could also be toned down significantly by more complex spawn, combat, site mechanics.
---
Going further, reward collection mechanics can be adjusted or redone while at the same time making it less profitable, more time and investment consuming to bot.
---
Going further still, adjustment to plex and sub prices by making plex more expensive while lowering sub prices would allow more regular players to go omega, botters are less likely to sub. 
---
Many things can be done.
---
Please keep at it :)
---
Yes, yes we would. Fuck off
---
The fact that the nergal does more damage than the ikitursa as long as you shoot at a target for less than 3 minutes and 40 seconds is really fucking sad. Also that the Kikimora does more damage than the ikitursa if you shoot at something for less than 2 minutes is also abysmal. What a sad excuse for a hac. It really should just get a double spool bonus giving it the same damage as a vedmak but it gets there sooner.
---
You mentioned wormholes twice in your issues but didn't touch on what about wormholes at all... What are you going to do for wormholes?
---
More like 1b one time payment.
---
I think it's going to be a given that renter corps/alliances will be full of bots.
---
what real other reason is there to rent space other than to bot to high heaven and back again?
---
then again, maybe if we had a reason to invade space and had enough players to actually populate null we wouldn't have large swathes of renter space for bots to bot in. vOv
---
It would be very hard to find out if it's "knowingly".
---
I think you're assuming the rent the renters are paying goons would just go away. But negwalleting is when CCP specifically takes away the amount of isk that the botters farmed from the alliance that owns them. For example when it happened to frat, and the balance of the alliance wallet dropped below 0.
---
Then you would not be one of the many.  You seem to be one of the less "advantaged" player-base.  My apologies for overlooking your demographic.
---
Please do not forget the botting groups (to the same amount) of the "other" chinese faction too like exposed in threads the last days in PeriodBasis. Then all will be good
---
Who cares? End justifies the means.
---
Needs more shades of khaki imo

&gt; that doesn't make me a piece of shit

This just in, doing something nice for the sake of doing something nice in daves world makes you a doormat.
---
No idea why people think you're a pile of shit Dave, its honestly a mystery.

It has NO implication on your real life if just your character or corp gets shamed. If you think it is a good idea to link your game character to your real life person publicly ... well thats your decision ...

this isn't 'something nice' it's literally some one else's job, something they are paid to do. you're not giving them half of your sandwich because they forgot their lunch - you're doing the very thing they are paid to do. that's not 'being nice' that's being taken for a fucking ride.
---
What about 1 random npc per anomaly. It doesn't aggro or shoot the bot. It's name is pure BS - randomly generated letters and numbers. So the drones don't attack it because it doesn't agress also, because the name is randomized it becomes more difficult to code to kill it.
---
Stitch K, it says it right there in the username.
---
This has to be a continous effort, as the average VNI Bot is recreated with a few injectors and clicks ...
---
My hero
---
Stuff like 100% tax corps with a bunch of vni losses are good indicators though (just as example before you hang yourself up on this). Indicators that would give something away if you don't ignore them. And if you ignore them you willingly turn a blind eye and deserve to get punished for it.
---
Having real-life connections is irrelevant. What matters is that if CCP publicly comes out and says "X player did a bad thing", and then the player successfully appeals for any reason, it casts the entire bot-management process into doubt and embarrasses CCP.
---
Trig overwhelming a sov region could then force the displaced refugees to move elsewhere, creating friction with other entities, and war as they relocate. 
---
The carrot didnt work. Now null gets the stick. Or something.
---
But just think: For each newbie they visit, this is their first time encountering the joke.
---
Dreks and Zarmz everywhere you mean? 
---
To be expected. CCP probably overtuned these on purpose as the way to dangle new shinies in front of people, and its working. I'd expect we'll be seeing more comps based around these to help bust up bunker/turtle fleets of damnation/guardian comps. 
---
I'm not particularly a fan of trig stuff, i see its uses/merit, i expect when we get new T2 trig ships, t1 stuff will get nerfed to a reasonable position (believe kiki is getting nerf when T2 stuff comes out). I like a more diverse hangar of ships to choose from for fleets/small gang. There is no doubt that trig stuff isn't strong and a good way to break stalemate's though, or being a giant killer comp (anti-capital).
---
I respect everyone owning his shitshow o7

I was in TRI at the time of the fight. It was good, but it was also REALLY exhausting for us (I stayed up all fucking night for it) and as soon as the node died we were just like "fuck it", not aware that you guys would be seeking reprisals in such a short time.
---
The sperging on Reddit during the blockade was bloody hilarious. The fact that people fell for a fake ping about some bug or whatever was absolutw gold.
---
I still firmly believe Imperial Legacy should be broken up because I view them as a threat to the state of nullsec, but credit where credit is due, you did good on that day.

Super refreshing! Good luck Stitch!
---
Yeah there are indicators. It's a very difficult and resource intensive thing to look into. Assuming that CCP go further than just removing ill gotten isk.
---
Or their hand. 😂
---
Why not just remove it completely or have it like unknown space? If you have a delay, then people will wait for the delay to expire before taking a risk. If you have towers or anything that is needed to have local, it will become a ‘requirement’ to have operational before taking a risk.

TEST
---
That's great and all but when are you guys going to take things serious and tackle the root cause of most of these issues? These botting tools are available freely and in some cases even opensource.
---
Your proposals are not enough. Cynos are fundamentally broken. Anything less than a 5 min delay should be seen as a bad faith suggestion. Capital application to subcaps is too good. Battleships are shit. One frig with a TD and all turret BSs are pretty much useless. ECM is still a problem. Injectors are killing the game.
---
Why do we need CSM?
---
Unless they negwallet by the amount of isk gotten by botting, I am sure 4-5 trillion would be noticed.
---
I'm rooting for Hogs!
---
Oink Oink!
---
How would you deal with hostile alliances putting botting alts into your alliances in order to attract this type of punitive action?
---
I'm not against it outright, but it's potentially open to abuse.
---
What makes you think they wont ignore that as well?
---
&gt; i don't have many complaints (except for my hate of frigate holes) on the low class side of WH
---
How about the income is so bad and not sustainable it has no pull on players to move there. I actually saw a lot moving out because of it. Today you live in lowend WHs because you like the pvp there, no other reason.
---
If you accept people into your alliance to rent out space to them it should still be your job to have an eye on them. if they do shit that makes it obvious they're botting and you ignore it and they get banned then you shouldnt be surprised people assume you knew that you had botters there.
---
Dear wingspantt,
---
I order some ammo from one of your agents to my Loki in ~~redacted~~, the delivery started smoothly and product was received, sadly the ammo I ordered to properly de-rust my hull failed to detonate. I now have a half de-rusted Loki and a box of dud ammo that I would like to return to the nearest agent.
---
Please advise
---
A concerned customer.
---
A lone bot or two isn't going to trip the bells and whistles. Plus a lone bot can't neg a wallet enough to kill a corp. But a whole corp of botters? That only happens when people are either willfully ignoring it or it is renters and no one is randomly checking their killboard to see if they are bots or not.
---
People that like PVE don't care about PVP most of the time, and people that love PVP don't care about PVE most of the time.  
---
Eve universe is by far one of the top sci-fi universe. The game is looking awesome even for a 16 years old game. By far the best exploration in any other space game because it's worth doing it.  
---
The reason I stopped playing is that a lot of the content is that I don't feel like investing billions and billions of isk in game content and it wiped out by some bored player looking for some sand castle to kick.  
---
We're most likely very few since after 16 years of EVE, there is still no PVE server. CCP most likely did some market analysis and said it wasn't worth it. That it would split the current player base. Or it's simply against their vision of the game and money isn't important in any mean.  
---
It might hurt the PVP server a little, since some player would do the server switch, but how many new players would then join the PVE server?  
---
A PVE only server would need some fine tuning, but they could copy/paste most of the feature and name it something else.  
---
"go play something else"  
---
"Not a game for you"

"Don't hit the door hit you"

Listen here you mongoloid, any real person playing this game is valued.  If you think for one second that an alpha player, in whatever financial position they are in, aren't worthy of playing *YOUR* spaceship game then you can go ahead and fuck right off. Liquify all your pilots. Nothing will be lost.
---
And that's a lot of herons... Pooh boi that's a lot of herons.
---
Noticed? Yes. Hurt them? No.
---
It really doesn't, you can literally have a NPC only overview tab check if drones are idle and click the top entry and press F. 
---
like in terms of code this is trivial to solve.
---
Hell yeah this would be good to see
---
The big secret nobody talks about.
---
EVE's code is so retarded, it has no defense at that level to combat botting.
---
Entire came would have to be rewritten to fix the problem.
---
just a reminder that as cancerous as bots are, it is outrageous to hold paying players responsible for the cheating of other players (as was suggested at evesterdam). aggressive banning is fine, but expecting alliances to police botting for free on behalf of ccp is total bullshit, and if you guys take that approach i think people will be entitled to feel exploited. 
---
ccp's approach to game design is what makes botting rampant. it's 100% on ccp to police botting on behalf of your paying customers in your game. expecting people paying ccp to play a video game to spend that time doing admin work for ccp is just outrageous imo.
---
Well, that idea is out. What about one wave spawning a random NPC that actually reads as a newly created character in local for a minute. Make them warp off. How would you code around that?
---
lmao they banned alpha VNI accounts
---
Banning in dribs and drabs would allow other botters to adapt practices (or whatever, I don't understand how this works)
---
Who is NINED? Apparently they are claiming copyrights to this
---
That's why, unless an alliance has an active force deployed to police it's own playerbase and kill their own bot friends, they should be assumed guilty for harboring bots.
---
Don't they take the isk too?
---
Oh boy... here we go again...
---
This was hilarious and a ton of fun!  Some additional details:

* There was someone in the raitaru the whole time, but never aggressed.

* He never put fighters out or tried to fight or move, aside from orbiting raitaru.

If you think your guys are botting, you should act.
---
Seems i'm being misinterpreted.  I'm not talking about Alpha adjustments, I'm speaking to adjustments to force people to be at the keyboard or make AFK VNI'ing more difficult.
---
The demographic i'm calling pathetic is the one that doesn't want changes to their AFK farms.

But bravo on the emotion, I suppose!

---
I don't disagree, but I also know that the second we do PanFam will go back to beating up on us, so no thanks. We formed because PL wouldn't leave us the fuck alone, and every time they evicted another small alliance we gained recruits. Focusing on Imperial Legacy is just treating the symptoms instead of curing the disease.
---
god bless you sir, god bless you
---
It should be in the interest of every fair normal player to disrupt cheaters as much as possible. This is not about doing CCP's job but to act in your own interest for a healthy game.
---
If they can be tracked, but there are ways of transferring that are really hard to track ...
---
&gt; If you accept people into your alliance to rent out space to them it should still be your job to have an eye on them. 
---
why?
---
This sounds like a really cool idea. Some of the biggest Corporations and Alliances have started in off game forums. That being said, please be very careful of scammers. This game is absolutely ruthless and there are thousands of players that would love to take advantage of your group. If you do want someone to help you, I would recommend a couple of things. First, make sure one of your community is in charge, and I would even say to only give limited roles to the person you are having help you. Second, it might be in your interest to contact a CEO of an already existing corporation and have them take you under their wing. They would probably love to have some newbie pilots out on the field helping them, and would be more inclined to see you succeed. With that being said, Good luck out there and fly safe.
---
Python will unlikely to ever dissappear. But there are a lot of potential things CCP could do to make it harder.
---
&gt; EVE's code is so retarded
---
Nobody talks about that?
---
Sounds like something CCP would be able to easily spot with a daily, weekly and monthly report to generate a list of pilots that should be investigated. I'd love to see this.
---
and there is a reason why we dont want china
---
pearl abyss buyout
---
ccp has never cared about bots before that now theyre banning them in droves
---
&gt; Also structure spam is lame. Nerf structure spam/timers etc.
---
How did we never realize this...
---
Oh that sounds very good. Too Bad i havent skilled into it before the nerf hehe
---
Or just just run a support Domi. It has a Larger sig then the nestor and the Drifter will always target it.
---
aaaaaaaahAHAHAHAHA
---
MORE MORE MORE. :D
---
DESTROY DESTROY DESTROY.
---
These vni bots are not hard to detect. The risk of them banning innocent players here is frankly relatively low.
---
Thank you for doing it before I got home, I was about to import a bunch of bot hunting gear. We'll wait until more patrols go out and find bots again.
---
They were since v8, let me know if they are missing somewhere.
---
So for the next step, we're just going to apply a light glaze to the turkey while we get ready to...
---
*goon bursts into studio waving arms*
---
"IT'S CCP'S JOB TO STOP BOTS!!! IT'S CCP'S JOB TO STOP BOTS!!!"
---
Do you have any proof these aren't UNRIGHTFUL BANS !!??
---
To an extent sure, but CCP have more tools at their disposal and get paid to do it. At what level is it someones responsibility to fight bots? And even then, is it the renter executor corp that pays? The alliances that are affiliated with the renters? Or the alliance that they pay protection money to? (KWG type deal)
---
It's a bit of a minefield, and I agree that something should be done, but the ideal solution is CCP tackle the botting problem.
---
Moreso, the bots buy plex in the market driving prices depending on how much plex whales buy to sell into the market. 
---
Less buyers less demand, yet our plex prices go up... even as they ban tons of bots.
---
It begs the question since plex sales per market have been normal, how many new whales are coming into the game or continuing to spend?
---
Fuck renters
---
Goons? Cheating??? NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
---
If I send that bot hunter guy 1b a month to hunt in my rental region would I then be covered from CCP?
---
so are your two dads
---
If you guys are even considering reopening contract proposals we've got guys that are willing to help you out on this one with training and automation.
---
I like this a lot.  Interested to see specifics on proposed cyno mechanics vs covert cynos. Overall, I welcome the attention to LS and J-space.  Good luck Stitch!
---
Because *you* accept them into *your* alliance and *you* reap the benefits from them paying rent. If you willingly accept isk that are aquired by breaking the rules then you're part of the problem. Easy as that.
---
Knowing about EULA-breaking and not reporting it, I would think.
---
If not, it is now
---
No, that's a pittance. You can make a bil a day in highsec...
---
&gt; expecting alliances to police botting for free
---
&gt;Kick from alliance
---
&gt;Set standings -10
---
Oh wow that was so fucking hard. 
---
If the bots have nowhere safe to go in null then everyone will just keep blowing them up.
---
They can't dock, they can't repair, their deathclone will toss them back in LS or HS.
---
*fool-proof
---
For the last point, probably just set NSA auto repeat to off.
---
I agree that going through all diplomatic strings would be too far fetched but actively applying measures inside the same alliance should easily be in the acceptable range. And yes ofcourse the botting problem should be tackled but at this point you can propably be happy when theres more countermeasures than the occasional banwave every some months.
---
it depends if it has a NPC flag in the overview. 
---
If it does all you do is character matching ( if anything a computers strcmp beats my manual process ). 
---
So what you do is simple if it has a ratting icon, you look for the 1 unknown npc on overview and compare that to toons popping in local ( this is assuming i have both overview and local from memory most bots do from what i could tell on open source bots sadly i can't really test this without breaking the EULA ). 
---
Now as a player it's honestly much harder to react to then as a bot because comparing a string of random number and letters is not something people are good at.
---
They're propably doing that, but CCP incestigates a bit deeper than just that and also bans in waves.
---
Fuck you FRAT, you awoxing assholes.
---
Literally china
---
Rip the Nergal
---
There have always been banwaves of bots, your statement is blatantly wrong.
---
This so much. All those VNI were alpha safe.
---
Not from the server, no. But on the client... the Python RT is trivially hacked, which has made the cost of developing new bots very low. There's some things you can add when you're not using Python's RT anymore, such as heap address space randomization and heap encryption, which makes the complexity and cost of developing bots higher. It's an economics game, and EVE is kind of niche. I don't think they have to defeat everything, they just need to make it expensive enough that bot authors move onto more lucrative, popular game titles.
---
How many non-botters rat 23/7 on alpha accounts? What about capping the number of hours an alpha account can be logged in in a 24 hour period?
---
How do you feel about the current situation in wormholes and what are your ideas to make changes?
---
How many years has it been since CCP made CSM in a shitty clumsy attempt to quell unrest among the playerbase after one of their numerous fuckups - was it the summer of rage?
---
And people still believe all this voting and "player advice" actually does anything, despite every CSM being a proof to the contrary.
---
The Gallente Militia thank you
---
yeah, are you going to do the anti-botting admin killah? no, you're not, and absolutely nobody in their right mind would pay ccp to police their game for them, for free
---
&gt;but expecting alliances to police botting for free on behalf of ccp is total bullshit
---
It is ultimately necessary to take it to that level as they are in on it.
---
&gt;and if you guys take that approach i think people will be entitled to feel exploited. 
---
People's feelings are so important! /s
---
I'll bet Frat is shaking right now
---
one of them shits an absolute fuckton of dps i wonder which one it is  
---
another is light blue  
---
another is dark blue
---
i am verily perplexed
---
Shit this isnt my alt *goes off grid*
---
Logibro complained how hard it was to track the blueprints and ships during the last AT cheating fiasco. And that's concrete, rare items.
---
Hey now, it's a worthy use of time, lol
---
What if the neutral NPC decoy spawned off grid? Granted, it could clog local if it was dozens of them being run- so call it just one and it refreshes to a different random name. Dunno.
---
Is he wrong? CCP is trying to strongarm the player base into policing themselves, which is stupid and crazy. They are either incompetent or lazy.
---
I've always had the idea for a sever that allows all Botting.
---
Literally turn the game into a Botting competition.
---
Already replaced.
---
i don't have anything to do with renters, botting, etc. but i did once do a lot of admin work for an alliance, and tbh it was the worst period of time i spent playing the game. the idea of doing it not for my alliance, but for ccp, would make me want to unsub
---
do taxes earned from botting get -walleted when bots are kill?
---
I'll definitely vote for you, but one nitpick on Navy/faction BS value thing.
---
I don't think it'll help to make faction BS more expensive. It'd be better to make Navy BS cheaper rather than faction more expensive. Faction BS have a ways to go in terms of cost increase before the ISK would outweigh the benefits, but if Navy BS stay at the same price there's still no reason to upgrade from T1.
---
If you ban on detection the bot maker can pretty quickly determine what they are detecting and alter the behavior.  If you do ban waves you only know that *something* you did in the last (whatever timeframe) got detected
---
labeling error != superposition
---
I guess they don't call you "Peligro" for nothing.
---
1b per ban
---
it's a game, rule enforcement doesn't fall to the players. people pay to be here to have fun, not to enforce rules
---
The Drekavac is a size class larger, along with all the disadvantages of having higher signature, lower speed, which should translate into less survivability. A ship isn't valued just on its raw DPS numbers, otherwise we'd all be using Dreadnoughts or polarized Navy Megas.
---
yeah, but how do you decide who is a bot? if it takes even an hour a a week, and you are PAYING for the privelege of doing it, doesn't that sound insane to you?
---
we pay ccp to play this game, it's their responsibility to run it. we are customers, not citizens, and if they want to stamp out botting they should hire more staff.
---
If i was managing any renters i know i would. Thankfully i'm not, since that seems to be turning people into idiots judging by a certain persons butchering of the english language ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
One shard doesn't work like that.
---
&gt;(believe kiki is getting nerf when T2 stuff comes out)
---
At least on SISI atm it is losing a couple PG, mystic tracking is being cut in half and it loses it's drones: the exact same nano shield fit still works, you just can't use mystic for literally everything and mystic tracking is down to being just a little bit better then scorch on pulse lasers (which is still stupid at 38km).
---
Lol, gtf outta here with your logic. Dontcha know this is reddit?
---
Hey I vote for you if you ask why TF medium autos haven't been buffed yet
---
Is this meant to be public agency information( shared between all users) or is it private information for each user seperately?
---
I love you
---
Bots don't "afk"
---
In some of the bot hunting vids I see 2 vnis in a single site.  Tried doing that a while back AFK, it doesn't really work (drones only aggro on 1 since rats only aggro on that one)
---
Throating street urchins for their spare change
---
How does checking the killboard imply they're bots or not?
---
The idea of playing against people who are flying 2 ships at once makes me not want to play :D
---
"banned ~600 accounts suspected of botting, mostly all in x and y alliances, pending investigation"
---
job done, no need for an embarrassing turnabout.
---
It's not going to work.
---
0 % kills, 100 % losses. All losses occurring in mining or ratting anomalies. All fits being similar to identical. All losses occurring in VNIs. Those are good starting points.
---
Lol I was just saying to myself yesterday that I hoped you'd be running. You 100 % got my vote, always enjoyed your videos and goodposts.
---
You're treating a symptom, not the problem. Nerfing VNIs is fine and all; I don't really give a crap about the ship itself. However, it won't do anything to curb botting. Remember, bots can automate more active ratting like shooting guns or missiles.
---
What? Those corps with 100% tax is filled with bots? Who could have known!?
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/Home_page.
---
Wow, the Chinese and Korean players are doing massive amounts of botting.
---
What a surprise.
---
That awkward moment when you need 3 groups and spies to fight us rofl
---
No fighter kills related... afk?  "Bot" that didn't fight back?
---
Was expecting shitstainguy.  Not a half bad shit post.
---
"Comedy routine"
---
Making it harder to print ISK with minimal effort as an alpha does curb botting, because they need to make enough ISK to create a new omega account before getting banned in that case.
---
Please please please focus on player created lore rather than in game lore. The stories we have created over the 16 years are much more interesting than the npc lore! 
---
I’ve seen this channel on youtube and the lore videos are excellent. I am sure i wouldn’t be the only one to watch lore videos about the political situation in eve.
---
Nice!
---
shit i knew i had to name my botting char sth else than scoots choco  
---
they are on to me
---
What usage? 
---
Only for their force fields as an escape option? 
---
If so, I'll add a D-Scan preset for that.
---
If more than X% of accounts in an alliance or its known pets are botting then it's a pretty good indicator.
---
Ergo, CCP Peligro = God.
---
if you would, that's cool. if bot investigation and policing is how you want to play the game, more power to you. but players absolutely should not be obligated to do it, and i can guarantee that almost 100% of the people saying they should will never, ever lift a finger themselves.
---
it's very easy to come up with obligations for other people
---
I just called them, went to voice mail.
---
I'm glad you included that wire reference
---
at least you have a good taste of shows
---
If they keep going out in VNIs and dying, resulting in only vni and pod losses.
---
Shadow ban botters by moving them to a dedicated botting servers. The bot-handler will still see all the logs of ISK made and ISK transferred (top copied characters on the bot server), but no actual ISK will make it to 'customers' on Tranquility.    
---
Then from there we go all out [SSCAI](https://sscaitournament.com/) and encourage people to build bots to fight other bots.
---
Upvoted for visibility, morally downvoted for IP theft.

In completely unrelated news 600 new characters were created today...

Knock knock

The Seas, who?
---
The Seas and desist Letter
---
So, did you build your first Legion?
---
good one
---
A lot of blatantly obvious botting corps need less background checks to determine what they are doing than a lot of alliances have as entry requirement anyway. Surely that can't be asked too much and i don't think the warning in Peligros tweet was aimed towards policing botters that would need actual in depth investigation and monitoring.
---
So, this is great, obviously, but how long after those bans do you think the new alpha character was spun up and put on the train to VNI, or even injected into it? And 600 is a really small number considering how rampant it needs to be.
---
We really need game design changes to reward active gameplay (which is harder to write a bot for), client engine changes to disrupt bot writers (just move stuff around or differently obfuscate it in each released client?) and a long hard look on what alphas can fly and do. You can never win an enforcement race against F2P farmers because there is always a new, clean VM they can create new accounts on.
---
They have one of those, it's named Serenity.
---
Literally unplayable.
---
Defaq is that fit
---
Can we talk about that half-assed dual tank? Seriously, what is this fit for?
---
That isn't a terrible idea, except then they just have 3-4x the number of accounts that log in and out in shifts.
---
[2 minutes later](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76611759/) might be a case of being bad.
---
&gt; Entire came would have to be rewritten to fix the problem.
---
This is not an uncommon occurrence for a 16 year old game.
---
Because nullsec isn't wormhole space. There should be differences between null and wormhole space local.
---
A tower/observatory would be a requirement but also a focal point to effect local and create conflict. Botters/Sov holders don't want to undock, knock out their local in a few systems. Means their ratters need to go somewhere else, or they don't collect taxes from ratters for a few days. Or, their ratters are forced to rat without local which introduces more risk instead of having perfect intel.
---
Ideally, the observatory would not be on grid with a citadel, but in its own pocket (not deployable in anoms/burner missions or any other stupid location).
---
The amount of effort that the ship needs to rat doesn't matter in terms of botting, though. Bots can automate button pressing. A bot operates just as well flinging missiles as it does ordering drones around. 
---
Now, if you wanted to reduce the amount of ISK a VNI makes by reducing its damage or drone velocity or whatever? Great. Go hog wild. However, that change will do absolutely nothing to curb botting. I won't try to make some dumb claim about it having the reverse effect or anything, and I won't try to claim some sort of mutual exclusion or other order of operations horseshit, but it's important to understand how the changes affect things. Combating botting, specifically, comes from a different angle. Nerfing VNIs accomplishes a faucet reduction, nothing more.
---
Period basis or pureblind? You can find bots in both
---
No, God doesn't answer your prayers. Peligro sometimes does. Peligro &gt; God.
---
How about the hunter side of things?
---
1. I jump into a system, see a nyx on scan. is it at a POS? cant dscan it anymore since you removed it.
---
2. How am I supposed to see if a POS is offline with a CHA or SMA? [These](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76581147/) [things](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76394178/) [die](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76146559/) [every](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76020769/) [day](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75992145/).
---
And thats just two quick examples. I'm not sure why you'd remove something still actively used from your overview.
---
To be honest I still enjoy their style and I've seen it a lot more than twice.
---
9400 more to go for a single day...easy
---
Of all of the carrier fits I have seen, that is one.

or if you spend looking at the km, jackdaw in sh, it dropped, both kills in same location
---
Who knew a one-word comment would be one of the most
---
 upvoted comments on this sub in the last month (and it's only been an hour)
---
The ones I've been see are in Period Basis.
---
I was testing last night with bubbles, ESSes, log off traps, etc. Mixed success tbh. A little sad that ez content is gone since I live nextdoor to PB, but glad that the bots have been banned.
---
I'll have to poke through my kill mails (one alt does FW, another hauls through Thera...  I get plenty a blap a day), but I'll let you know!
---
You have my vote stitch! Good luck!
---
Would have lived if it was a shield super
---
Cheap bans all around!
---
Yeah, gonna add them back tonight.
---
Question just to help - I’m not there yet but I’ll take a lot of this into consideration for when I am...
---
Wouldn’t you likely keep your out/safe cyno to a known keepstar?  Aren’t a lot of the more sophisticated alliances running a safe cyno burning on their main structures for this?  
---
Also, for cyno alts in general, are these characters just alts you train on subordinate accounts and log them when needed?  If you’re doing any kind of JF work from high sec to null do you keep cyno alts docked up in a low sec system or area to be available to jump caps thru?  
---
I’m curious how “cyno alts” are trained/used.  
---
Good guide!
---
What's unacceptable is repeatedly harboring cheaters, profiting from it, announcing to your alliance that they shouldn't report bots because it's lucrative to tax them. 
---
That's not game play, that's enabling a major issue in eve online which CCP intends to address. 
---
Keep in mind there is complete traceability of all assets in EVE; so what comes from a bot is going to be chased all the way downstream. 
---
We are going to be more thorough, we have a bigger team working on improved procedures and tools to do exactly this. 
---
Team Security sends their regards.
---
Or use a sebo fit and just rat aligned
---
Do belt rats in nullspace drop better loot and is the salvage better?
---
first of all, at evesterdam the impression was given that alliances will need to start clamping down on botting 'or else'.  
---
but more importantly, i object *on principle* to the idea that paying customers should be under any **obligation** to police ccp's game for them. this is a video game that people play for fun, and if people enjoy policing bots, more power to them. but it's completely unacceptable for ccp to punish paying customers because they don't want to do boring admin grind for free.
---
u/cccp_peligro what happens to the character names used by those bots? since they are permaband will those names be released again?
---
Also after May 28th, will you feed the bots to the coming Triglavian Invasion force? :)
---
not anything close to the past year, obviously ccp has banned bots in the past
---
if you don't keep your eye on them you don't know about eula breaking
---
I like this.
---
&gt; The amount of effort that the ship needs to rat doesn't matter in terms of botting, though.
---
That depends how much of the information needed to put in that effort is available to a bot. I'm not an expert on Eve bots but I do know that you need a lot more information and ability to perform the correct actions to lock ships up, fire weapons and manage reloads than you do to orbit a structure in a known location and launch drones.
---
There aren't many alpha capable ships that can use missiles from outside NPC engagement range, either, like the 100MN VNI can, so they'd also have to worry about tank management.
---
The reductio ad absurdum of the argument you're making here is that it doesn't matter how hard you make the game, it won't reduce botting because 'bots can automate button pressing'. Well, sure, but only if the author knows (i) how to find the button, (ii) when to press it and (iii) where to get the information to make the decision in (ii). Making that harder makes writing an effective bot harder.
---
And yes it would also be good for the game for legitimate players if you actually had to play the game to generate wealth.
---
That's called a VNI alt, and legit players who AFK rat in VNIs die much more often than bots...
---
I'm already in that discord. 
---
As far as direct FW changes go, i'd like to see citadels get locked out by having them assigned to factions. So when systems change sides, those citadels are locked out/put into lower power. You can only lay down citadels in that system if your faction owns it and that you're a part of. You cannot add groups to dock in the citadel if they are part of the opposing faction.
---
I'd like to see ventures and anything with a warp core stab not count against the countdown/timer of a plex.
---
Creating a rooke (truly novice) complex that only allows T1 frigs in, not navy or pirate
---
Having neutrals that enter a FW complex go suspect or at least create a no penalty timer to engage them.
---
Obviously, adjust LP and rebalancing navy ships as mentioned in OP.
---
Those are just a few off the top of my head, but i've also looked into having a warzone/dynamic border where only those area's can be plexed. But it also limits pvp where people want to solo and not deal with fleets/large groups. So further review would be needed.
---
there's no way to determine if they're breaking the rules as a player, though
---
obviously some people know and are just looking the other way but i don't think it's every alliance renting. when's the last time NC. kicked botters from their renters?
---
A VNI alt is unlikely to be on an alpha account, because then you can't run it together with your main. So a VNI 'alt' on an alpha account is very likely a bot.
---
Because you light it and some buddies come and fist everything to death.
---
So that's how you quickly scan. I was there, manually aiming in space to dscan. Always was a pain.
---
Law six.
---
So the misuse of benefit of doubt by the player finally turned it into destroying them with facts and logic. No /s here.
---
My favorite was when TEST pipebombed PH out of no where when PH was looking for a three way fight which included Brave. 
---
Sadly at work so I cant remember the specifics off the top of my head.
---
So eve can die slowly on two places instead of one?
---

Western Pure Blind has more than its share, too.

What does that have to do with my comment?
---
That’s some backward logic if you know anything about the origin of PA
---
Pvping badly is easy.
---
I can tell you no one whos been a hog for any amount of time thinks were "elite" we have our strengths and weaknesses like any other group but that's the nature of the beast, as others have said we bring on anyone who is willing to contribute and we take on content as it comes no fuss no muss. Theres a lot of people who use hogs for the benefits and none of the responsibilities but that's well above most of our paygrades and for the most part we don't care. We obviously don't control high sec but again as others state we try to make things benefit us i.e. remove other structures that effect our index and that's the end of the "control" on the system.
---
You don't get a fight in Tama, you get a gank or nothing.
---
Are you reading the same comments I'm making? I'm cool with VNIs getting kneecapped. Really. Nerf them into the ground; I don't care. The only thing I'm saying is that you shouldn't pretend like it's going to be some panacea for botting. It's thinking like that which pushes through ham-handed changes and their corresponding period of contented ignorance; "we've solved the problem, time for a beer and an Icelandic 4 month summer vacation." Meanwhile, the problem continues, abated for a few weeks at most before returning, meaner than ever, because the solution offered doesn't actually work.
---
Related to the botting dev thing, are you a new player or something? Bots that automate missile shooting and other gunnery jiggerypokery have been around for more than a decade. The bot ship of choice in 2012, for instance, was a missile-spewing Tengu. I also personally saw L4 bots running Marauders in highsec in those days, too. Writing bots that shoot misl instead of commanding drones is not that much harder. The work's already done. And, to put a finer point on it, it's an amount of work that has to be done exactly one time. Once you stick the landing on it, it just works forever*.
---
i want to work for CCP security but I dont know shit about programming. Can I just send you killmails of bot VNIs and Gilas and you guys send me a paycheck each month?
---
As i stated in multiple comments there are hood indicators. Don't accept them or if they start doing it after accepting kick them. There might be a few false positives but they're just renters after all.
---
I have zero faith such a system will not be games and do little to nothing to drive meaningful content. Reminds me of those structures that offer more bounty payouts and were gamed for years. And then there were the moon goo siphons...
---
Neutered from the start and not addressed for years.
---
Thank you.
---
Why rent when you can join the largest coalition in the game for easy access to ratting space?
---
Gonn a make rookie chat a lot easier
---
Glad to hear some of what has been discussed there are things youd advocate for.
---
FW absolutely needs some changes, all of which I only see as benefitting the game as a whole.
---
But that's my perspective. ^^
---
Bots are perfectly capable of targeting and shooting rats. Long, Long ago in the before times, before AFK VNI's, because everyone and their dog had a ratting Super, bots farmed money by Mining. The meant they automatically managed warping to belts, targeting the correct rocks, watched cycle times, jetcanned the ore hold, and warped back to station, changed to a hauler, scooped the cans, and dumped in station. Rinse and repeat.
---
Especially given the number of times that CCP has told us that just because we think someone is a bot doesn't mean they actually are a bot.   
---
Plus, I believe that first time botters only get a 30 day ban from CCP?  
---
You are absolutely correct.  I don't care which alliance you are in - you simply do NOT have the tools to determine definitively if someone is botting. Only CCP has that.  CCP should police botting 1000 times more aggressively than they currently do, but in no way, shape, or form, should players be required to do it for them **for free** *or else*.
---
&gt; Bots that automate missile shooting and other gunnery jiggerypokery have been around for more than a decade. The bot ship of choice in 2012, for instance, was a missile-spewing Tengu
---
And CCP have done no security updates to the Eve client since 2012? Bot authoring isn't (or, at least, shouldn't be) write once, work forever.
---
&gt; I'm cool with VNIs getting kneecapped. Really. Nerf them into the ground; I don't care
---
Well if you actually support nerfing VNIs, alpha clone and AFK ratting (and other near-AFK methods of ISK generation) then that's great and I look forward to your support in the next thread about it.
---
Yes, this is how corps and alliances end up with negative wallets.
---
This is a great addition!
---
So basically... your job. You want us to do YOUR job for you. We're customers not employees. I understand banning corps that have 100% tax setup and continually cycle in VNI bots, but there is zero chance that Mittani should be responsible for making sure corp X in his coalition isn't botting.
---
Much appreciated &lt;3 
---
Thanks for keeping us updated on the progress.
---
emails to security at [ccpgames.com](https://ccpgames.com) are appreciated but may not be answered, large volume.
---
also don't send me malware pls :(
---
You ever heard of Mar5hy? If they implement this sort of thing, instead of having 100 cloaky camper alts, he will turn them into sabotage bots. Putting all 100 in goons to neg their wallet. 
---
You underestimate the dedication of people in this game.
---
Dude, I love you. Keep this up.
---
Basic bots aren't doing anything in memory. And CCP has ways of detecting unauthorized code running in the client without getting into an arms race trying to lock the client down.
---
For the life of me, I wish I could find that powerpoint again one of their security team members presented at a security conference (Iceland Security Conference? Been too long) where they talked about how they detect botting/rmt as well as malicious code.
---
I just remember it fired shots at Blizzard (We don't trust the client. Blizzard trusted theirs and look where it got them.) as well as some RMT detection techniques.
---
Helpful for anyone who ever tries to help another person understand and enjoy this game.   Thank you!
---
Thats a lot of words trying to explain away your personal douche baggery.
---
Doesn't really work though.
---
REGION LOCK CHINA
---
realtalk I reported a buncha shit from Period basis and Paragon Soul, so hopefully this is the result of those reports ^_^
---
That'll be $20 or a taco bell chalupa meal.
---
But the people who rent out space actively reap benefits from cheaters. So if they know (or could easily see if they don't close both eyes) people that pay them are cheating i would almost go as far and say they're cheating by proxy and thus deserve punishment aswell. How are you better than a botter if you know and accept people are botting and benefit from it?
---
So don't invite a dude with 100 alts right off the rip?
---
I like your outside of meta videos. You have my vote.
---
&gt;#1 Preparation is key; Know the cosmic sigs in the system you’re going to rat in and close any Worm Holes (even the small ones) and either do the sigs or be cognizant as to what they are (I tend to quickly do the data/relics and notate combat sigs).
---
literally just watch local
---
&gt;#2 Again, preparation; Post scout(s) at most likely incoming gates of adjacent system(s). Try to have adjacent systems be approximately 20+ AU across to allow for reaction time. Use your ship of choice, but I usually post scouts in a VNI and have a Cyno ship in a “capital dock-able structure” in system to swap with. 
---
lmao that's retarded, literally just watch local.
---
&gt;If you do not have an Omega alt, then its eyes only and no cyno out (so, know your friendly beacon(s)).
---
if you don't run your caps in alts you deserve to die anyway.
---
&gt;#3 Use systems where the Havens and/or Sanctums spawn approximately 30AU or greater from gates for that pop-up “whoah! Where’d he come from” Dictor or Bee-lining Inty. Well, for any ship really, but you know. If you’re getting caught, make them work for their catch.
---
i'm sensing a pattern here
---
Glad to hear there's finally more momentum to get you guys the resources youve desperately needed for years.
---
NC. members rejoice
---
&gt;And CCP have done no security updates to the Eve client since 2012? Bot authoring isn't (or, at least, shouldn't be) write once, work forever.
---
Obviously, if you checked out a git commit of botting software from 2012 and tried to run it today, it probably wouldn't work. The point of stating that was to illustrate that the core mechanic is not only solvable via software, but has been done before. It's just out of favor right now due to the specific quirks of the meta.
---
&gt;Well if you actually support nerfing VNIs, alpha clone and AFK ratting (and other near-AFK methods of ISK generation) then that's great and I look forward to your support in the next thread about it.
---
:nallears:
---
Ningen, please.
---
we also have Squeal Team Six you know for those "elite" fights ;)
---
Good points, however I think you may confuse cause and effect.  Unarguably it is true that C1/2 are not viable as ratting spaces and are therefore used as industry hubs and staging areas for PvP.  However, this isn't "by design", this happened because of the crash in ISK for sleeper salvage and many far easier and safer ways to generate income.  You can argue that (Asset at risk) / (value of site) should be constant across all (wormhole) space.  However, the risk is greater in WH space than LS or NS (no local / no supercap umbrella etc).  Driving people into LS by making low class WH industrial deadzones can not be good game design (and I doubt this is intentional).  
---
The effect however remains that C1 and to some extent C2 are nothing but PI farms with increasingly afk-Rorquals, devoid of other, challenging content.  I.e. mini Nullsec.  
---
The issue, in my opinion is not to make C2s more valuable in terms of ISK but provide different reasons to live and explore there.  Different types of filaments that take WH effect into consideration, different (not more) moon minerals, different citadel mechanics, some mutaplasmic reactions that can only be done in WHs with effect... ... With respect citadel mechanics, sure, all chest-beating real men want removal of citadels from WH space to be faster and easier.  What that means is that the few smaller C2/C1 corps simply leave and go to the perfect safety of Delve.  
---
Bottom line, WH space hasn't been touched by CCP in years while other regions have seen substantial change.  In a connected universe, one can not change one thing and hope that another thing isn't affected.  The whole point is that all elements in New Eden are.  
---
Once you are on the CSM, I am sure you will listen for changes and keep the fringe regions in mind.  Bob Speed to you.
---
And now for my next trick
---
*waves hands around*

capital ships appear out of thin air
---
Light cyno. People get hit.
---
M-OEE8, the starting days of WWB. I was a FW lowsec pleb at the time, when all the announcements came in that there was gonna be a big fight I decided to go check it out for shits and giggles.
---
Fit up a really badly fit tackle Tormentor, some actual garbage fit with MWD+scram+web and whatever other random garbage I could fit from my hangar (I believe there was inertia stabs and everything, serious 420 iq big brain fit).
---
Spend a good 20minutes getting to the system through the heaviest tidi I had ever experienced at the time. Finally arrive at my destination, more people in local than I had ever seen before, soulcrushing tidi for the first time in my life. I decide to wander around nearby systems to see what's going on elsewhere. After what feels like an eternity I get through the J-GAMP gate and see some fleets fighting off the gate.
---
Armed with the cheapest beer I could find, I valiantly overheated my MWD and burned right towards the blob. Hyped up on reddit propoganda, I singled out a goon Machariel and orbited it at 500m with scram + web on. I basically just orbited it and shot it till my guns burnt out, then just held tackle until someone bothered to kill me. Managed to get top damage on the killmail when it eventually went down.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/52880066/
---
Tl;dr - whoring in M-OEE8.
---
Unironically the battle of SH1 when I realized I fucking hate TIDI and mass fleets, and "epic battles" where you spend most of your time anchored, F1ing, sperging out on reddit, and being essentially an NPC in someone else's real time strategy game.
---
Very nice, could see this being useful to have a step by step instructions for things to do ingame.
---
wich one is the damavik and wich one is the leshak
---
The question is which major alliances DON'T sponsor it in some form.
---
but why should you have to look for indicators of botting? that isn't your job, it's ccp's
---
if you have little to no contact with your renters should you be punished for that?
---
Good.
---
Need to modify it so that when you highlight the undock button for NC it breaks the game.
---
I think covert cyno's are well balanced and are already restricted to covert ops ships. They themselves would not suffer from any penalty. Though, talking about inhibitors, i do think it would be fair if inhibs (either the deployable or through bastion/some other marauder module) would also prevent their operation.
---
Take my fucking upvote
---
&gt; now that we have people committed to 0.0 living  
---
Hello 2008, is that you?
---
Do faction warfare- great for new players and can craft some pretty cool lore.
---
I laughed at my desk.
---
You have exactly zero tools available to the community to monitor behaviors you would identify as botting behaviors. 
---
In order for the community to police this, we would have to develop extremely database intensive tools to scan every players ESI market data and we still wouldn't know if its really a bot or just a guy with three cans of Monster energy drink and a hard on for Sanshas Nation who wants a gate to low sec.
---
Please act with some credibility.
---
my VNI alt is offended by your assumption of its clone status
---
[Check out this guy trying to score PC brownie points.])(https://twitter.com/SMmmann/status/1125811950808649728)
---
Hey nurse here, so, if you're using whole blood from a human I think the color would be off.   
---
So if you were to use packed red blood cells it would be a little different.   
---
From my experience 1 unit of PRBC is about 300mL, which equates to roughly 1 point of hemoglobin.  
---
The average male runs at like 15.5 HGN so we'll say 15 hemoglobin x300 = 4500mL of red blood cells.   
---
So using your numbers that means we need 38889 (rounded up to whole number) normal healthy males to get a really nice red color on there.
---
As long as you take their isk you should be obligated to at least keep a slight eye on where said isk come from, yes.
---
nothing happens to the names, they stay in-game, you can still look them up in-game etc. names are not released unless the character is deleted. 
---
i have deleted some market bots in the past, because those are terrible...
---
it was perhaps a spike in communication. this work is always ongoing.
---
WTF CCP RIPPED OFF ***THUNDER FIGHTER***!
---
can we get the names of the ships next to their lines? some of us colorblind eve players can't enjoy the pleasure of your sexy colors
---
Ah okay, fair. Is it something that you're planning on making somewhat continuous?
---
IE every fortnight we banned X amount of players, X in in region 1,2,3 for example. 
---
Just seems like this seems to happen every few months and then it goes quiet so it feels like it's being ignored.
---
In your mom
---
That is kinda depressing.. I just invested a lot of money in VNI BPCS... but at least they're doing something about the bot problem :D
---
i am pretty sure goonwaffe is botters let's ban goonwaffe
---
get your pitchforks here
---
Bhaalgorns are already 200-250m, they are near T1 levels of price. You can't make navy ships cheaper than T1, which means pirate battleships need to become more expensive/rarer.
---
In combination with making pirate battleships rarer, navy ships should also see a buff to make them more desirable and also an LP reduction. Which would bring the progression back to a healthy progression of T1 -&gt; Navy -&gt; Pirate.
---
Stitch good luck man! You know this game like the back of your hand and will help a lot! You can count on my vote.
---
uhhh thats damn cool.
---
But when we do we call it fuschia
---
They're certainly not happy with Peligro on Twitter
---
This is bullshit, CCP would never take away the amount "the botters farmed" from the alliance that owns them.
---
They take away any payments made from that corp to the alliance. So if a corp has been renting for 12 months at the cost of 1b a month, CCP would take away 12b.
---
That's all well and good but if you want me to do YOUR JOB then I at least want free sub
---
Ganking is a thing, I don't see why we'd haze these guys for it. What do you do if you see a retriever in nullsec lol?
---
Finally CCP giving us trash talk support in the form of Linking our enemies the undock button.
---
Hahaha, damn, wish I had some gold to give you.
---
also mac noris (kwg ceo) and hes alts (senna black, and other, include holder corporation ceo) was banned some time ago. he change all info and all toons to new ones.
---
That fleet combo looks so spicy, I can spot Zealots and Kikimora and most importantly Deimos in it.
---
I may have botted on a few different games. 
---
The "but there is no way I could have known!!!" defense is dumb. I mean its just the way people try and pretend everyone else is too dumb to not call the bullshit. 
---
Humm, i have 6 accounts, all are logged in 24/7, nobody can contact me except at specific times where i"m playing a more active account. One account is stuck circling a rock with nothing to kill for the last 24 hours. Anytime an unknown pops up immediately all 6 accounts go dock.
---
It may be possible to play eve blind but i don't see how it would be a good experience.
---
Oh boy, banned as many bots as they make in a week every year!  Many of these FRT.Treasury bots have been operating blatently for a LEAST 6 months.
---
Start fining corps and alliances every time a bot that is a member gets banned.
---
Excellent.
---
&gt; major issue in eve online which CCP intends to address
---
You going defame them with evidence in a giant dev blog with people's real names.
---
9D VR experience.
---
Check /evejobs and the Eve Forums. There is a guy that has an eve-business setting up corps and alliances for people.
---
Alphas don't buy plex.
---
Most of the ones who complain about it not being their problem and refuse to help fix the issue are probably U.S. citizens. We demand that we have everything our way, but refuse to help create the environment.
---
Leshaks are good in kiting gangs, a t2 marauder leshak would be even better. 
---
Your assumption that marauders being immobile is incorrect.
---
Wow, by his logic the mafia should be fine because it isn't the bosses doing the dirty work. Smh
---
That is not true, they've been there a while. Some of the VNI bots are new, though.
---
They dont have to police their game, they just have to not collude.
---
to be clear, i am all for increased action on botting. any work you guys do on that front has my support.
---
but I am extremely wary of language such as "repeatedly harbouring cheaters" - it should not be the players' responsibility to police that, or to check if their members are breaking the rules. the people who do the admin in these alliances are ultimately customers paying to play a game for fun.
---
if there is clear evidence of deliberate enabling of profiteering, fine. but even if alliances are just turning a blind to botting, they shouldn't be punished for it, because it's not their job. it's your job, and they are the people paying you to do it.
---
Hard to know who is bot and not sometimes...
---
CCP have all the tools we just need to trust in them to do the right thing!
---
Question about the bans, is it an account ban or a ban on MAC addresses?
---
I guess what I'm asking is, is there ways not make it more difficult for the botters to come back?
---
thats absurd
---
CCP should also take out (for example ) 500 % of bounties collected by each bot , out of the repeating offender's alliance wallet . 
---
Make them feel the hurt for harbouring bots
---
should be easy for ccp to ban that then
---
You think you saw all in this game? [https://zkillboard.com/kill/66859738/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/66859738/)
---
Yeah, which is exactly what CCP is doing and is probably fine because no specifics were given - they didn't "name and shame".
---
he only works once a month
---
As absurd as saying bots are bad but then trying to justify turning a blind eye towards botters?
---
&gt;This has to be a continous effort, as the average VNI Bot is recreated with a few injectors and clicks ...
---
fresh new buddy accounts can get into shitty vnis instantly, hope this helps
---
My favourite time was in Darkside. We've flying Drake gang, and i was logi. It's so fantastic if you can save everyone in your fleet.
---
because this isn't real life. we pay money to play this video game, and it's super-dumb to suggest that by doing so we should be held responsible for what other players do. we're customers, not citizens.
---
karmafleet linemember is mega retard, news at 8
---
Sure, but that would imply you never look at your alliance killboard.
---
If you really dont, then sure.  I have never seen an alliance that didn't look at their killboard.
---
If you want to suggest one such alliance exists go ahead. All the others have no excuse.
---
Oh, true. I guess it'd have to be something you'd adjust on a case-by-case, since also consider the Typhoon, Typhoon FI, and Mach: TFI is as expensive as the Mach currently. No one wants to pay almost 4x the price of T1 for TFI. If Machs go up to, say, 650m, you'd just spring for that rather than settle for a TFI. (Tempest Fleet isn't as bad).
---
And don't get me started on the navy geddon...
---
AFK ratting is as bad as botting..  I find acceptable semi-afk or have an alt ratting while on fleet or doing other stuff, but a completely unnatended ratter is as bad as a bot.
---
While [Dreddit](https://dredditisrecruiting.com) isn't specifically a bot hunting corp, we are currently at war with some of the worst offenders: Fraternity. Our staging is right next door, so you'll have plenty of opportunities to kill some of the slippery bastards.
---
I am cleaning up my discs and found this. Made it a long time ago, thought I should post it anyway.
---
How about you ban the botters take the isk that they made  and assets and DO NOT EXPECT us to police the game for you.  
---
Yeah obviously we report bots but get it thru your thick skull that we cannot know who is 100% botting. You can. You do your job and dont make me a paying customer responsible for other peoples actions.
---
Good points
---
The rule of thumb for 1unit PRBC’s per 1g/dL of hemoglobin is a good one but breaks down outside relatively normal hemoglobin ranges
---
A better way to estimate PRBC volume is to use hematocrit, which historically was calculated by spinning down whole blood then measuring the lower fraction that was red (vs the serum that is clear and stays on top) as a percentage of the total. A normal hematocrit is around 45% (ie the bottom 45% of your centrifuge tube is red and the top 55% is clear). 
---
With a total blood volume of 5.5L, and hematocrit of 45%, we would expect 2.475L of that volume to be pure red cells (packed red blood cells / PRBC’s). 
---
Assuming this does not impact our spreading rate, it would provide 55% denser pigment (by removing the 55% of clear serum) and arguably necessitate only one coat instead of the originally planned two. 
---
The end result is the same volumetrically, so still reasonably approximated by the first estimate
---
I’m intrigued by your perspective on the better coloration from PRBCs as opposed to whole blood. I don’t have a physical explanation for this, maybe someone with a background in colorimetrics could explain this to us. 
---
In the meanwhile I’m going to swing by the lab myself for a little testing on white cloth
---
Cheers
---
If alliance leaderships said to their guys to report obvious botting to CCP and notify them so they would kick them in the meantime, instead of doing the opposite, that'd go a long way.
---
here is the CCP anti-cheat secret sauce:
---
- look at server logs for people doing $thing
---
- arbitrary decide people doing $thing more than x number of times over time period y are probably cheating
---
- ban them
---
- if legitimate players somehow got included in my arbitrary thresholds x and y, eh, fuck them
---
They are generally friendly when they get counter ganked as well
---
Killing Botters. RvB out here doing gods work.
---
Lol I don't play or understand eve but this is an epic gamer moment
---
&gt; CCP investigates a bit deeper than just that
---
Tell that to Brisc
---
HEY NOW GHFDRTTFGBJUTUUFF IS A GREAT HUMAN NAME!
---
YES PLEASE
---
You should be held responsible for what you do. And if you reap benefits from people who are obviously cheating then thats something you're doing. Don't want to get punished? Don't rent space out to obvious botters (and as Peligro said even tell people not to report bots because they bring in dank tax money thus admitting you know about it.) Is it really that hard to wrap your head around that?
---
Brand new toon, yes. Rest of it, no idea
---
People seem to be taking this as "you must actively hunt them" instead of "just don't knowingly harbor them" which is a big difference.
---
A quick fix would be to delay local, making space for bots a lot less free. We can hunt them to shit while we wait for your team to bring the thunder.
---
keep your out/safe Cyno to a known Keepstar... safe cyno burning on their main structures. 
---
Thank You!
---
Optimally yes, yes and yes.  I'll be editing the post with those as good practice, Thank You.  I'm personally a little more used to getting some distance from the KS because of other carrier traffic/de-confliction chat channels (which I erroneously completely forgot to mention) which affected my post.  I use cyno alts for back-up escape.
---
which make change, Thank You.
---
You don't know what was initially provided to them, neither do I. Hanging everything up on Brisc now will get old very fast, especially considering it was a completely different case in a completely different frame.   
---
Something something wizard hat.
---
there's no douchebaggery to explain, grath.
---
so you can bot.
---
That would be fun:)))
---
The feelings of your customers that are paying to keep your business alive are pretty important.
---
&gt; announcing to your alliance that they shouldn't report bots because it's lucrative to tax them.
---
#mittani on suicide watch

I tried the Z-S and immediately reverted back, I use your pack across all my alts and recommend it to everyone *despite* Z-S being my corp's "official" recommendation. Keep up the great work!

Make the anomalys spawm random rats that do wierd ewar on them or something a bot cannot adapt.

---
Fuck that shit tbh. All of the big alliances and renting alliances harbour cheaters of course because you made this game so repetitive and pve focused. None of them harbour them actively they just take players and corps that do their own thing and pay. Nobody is here to do your job because unlike you we are players and not ccp employees and hunting blue bots is nobody’s fun game. People want you to police the game not fuck up real player alliances. You’ve already done stupid shit enough with init for this year.
---
The best GM clapback this side of lyte smites
---
"Yeah lets not tell CCP about this botting ring in a 100% tax corp we made"
---
  - Doom
---
In all fairness, CCP put things to the CSM that match their roadmap so if low/FW isn't on it, they won't ask you about it.
---
To counter that, however, you can highlight how changes they plan to make in other areas of the game will impact low/FW/WHs. For instance, if a FW candidate had been on the CSM during the introduction of citadels we may not have ended up with quite the same level of problems that they have caused...
---
Clearly they should release the unredacted data dump.
---
auto-cannon blaster rokh has been hanging in my eft ever since they killed the old-style phone (my then dream ship to fly perfect skilled), maybe it's time to do it with lasers and 4 different tops when the PERMABAND skin is handed out ^^
---
#HOW DO YOU TELL THEY'RE BOTTING THO
---
Would you mind sharing the original file? I'd like to try and do something similar next time I use the laser
---
CCP still care, but its mostly about the wallet nowadays
---
Or he joins Frat and kills the bots you are letting run rampant, KWG for example :)
---
Who said bots shouldn't be reported "because it's lucrative to tax them"?
---
I laughed waaaay harder at this than I should have
---
:D that still fucking works.
---
I'm still giggling hysterically at this five minutes later.
---
Edit to suppt Q&amp;A: Yes, try to keep your out/safe cyno to a known keepstar.  A lot of the more sophisticated alliances do run a safe cyno burning on their main structures.
---
Also pay attention to Intel and other traffic/de-confliction chat channels.
---
Or still better he joins some C2&gt;NS corp and kills all the bots indescriminantly.
---
I've tried that with mixed success.  It still seemed a bit slow and lowed my ticks (not terribly, but enough to notice)
---
You mean to tell me he solo’d that thing in a Hecate? How long did that take?
---
There's a lot of bad faith argument/intentional misinterpretation by people posting here in response to Peligro; CCP doesn't want you to do their job for them, obviously, but every little bit can't hurt, which means reporting botting. Let THEM extrapolate the data -- if there's a glut of bots in specific areas, that's their inclination to start weighing heavier on the responsible parties.
---
We cannot, by any means or methods, continue to allow, ignore, encourage, advocate or facilitate botting in any way, full stop. For the health of the game and the community surrounding it, it has to continue to be addressed. Otherwise, we're just digging the trenches further, sov warfare will continue to be a stalemate and content stagnation becomes an even worse plague on EVE.
---
Thats the best solution tbh (not a wormholer btw)
---
They'll just Dscan until a ship appears in range and auto warp out
---
What's obvious botting to one person, is not so obvious to another.  As has been said here, players don't have the tools to decide in all cases, which means some reports will be fallacious.
---
On the other hand I do think it's incumbent on alliance leaders to set the broad policy, as they do with for example, having an "ochre rule".  A broad policy of "not our problem" maybe the correct one though, because there's nothing directors hate dealing with more than PvE drama.  Life is too short and a lot of them are busy enough as it is.
---
oh great, now we can tell everyone where the BLODDY ALLIGN BUTTON IS (and brodcast)
---
Deleting local won't magically fix it. We've been harping about it for so long it wouldn't surprise me if bots already use Dscan/cloaky alts on gates to detect people as they come in.
---
That makes sense on the current state of the covert cyno module as it stands now.  Covert cyno inhibs sound like it could be the end of black ops drops on worthwhile targets, though.  I know it's already tough to catch targets as it stands now with how safe null is.  Covert cynos inhibs in low sec only would be interesting to encourage more activity there, although I doubt a LS-only module/deployable wpuld ever happen.
---
These are also good points. Its kind of hard to expect certain operation of wormholes by design, since by design, you weren't ever supposed to live in wormholes. Also, it may be natural progression that a certain PVE playstyle gets farmed out and people move on to the next new/buffed isk making method.
---
I do agree with your view points though, but short of doing straight buffs to WH sites, i don't see a way to adjust isk payout in these sites, unless you allow more to spawn at a time. Which would add to isk inflation. 
---
Maybe instead of drifter battleship spawns, you get the chance for drifter cruiser spawns (assets are already in game) in low class. They aren't as oppressive as the battleships, but would still need some coordination to take down and help supplement some isk into the lower class sites by having them drop new materials that don't drop from drifter battleships for new ships/modules.
---
That is correct, I'll be keeping an eye out for anything that would effect WH space negatively and voice my concern/opinion to help prevent something negative from being ignored and be a detriment to WH space.
---
Thanks for the perspective!
---
Danger noodles! Call them by their correct name!
---
  It's the United States
---
Exactly.
---
What's interesting is where did the people now renting in PB come from?  Where they NC renters before then?  Did they just join the game, decide to rent in PB and start botting?  That seems quite unlikely.  PB has been rented out for what, a month or two?  These guys have been botting elsewhere for years no doubt.
---
Some half-ass insider info I can share. First thing first, as what some people already knew and as my flair shows, I'm in FRT.
---
And tl;dr; middle finger to CCP from someone who tried to do your job.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Greater Western Co-Prosperity Sphere is currently ran by the CEO of [PLA](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/corp/Peoples_Liberation_Army/alliances), a Chinese corp that's been in Goons for a while. PLA is quite famous for being hostile to FRT so I wouldn't comment too much on them to avoid bias. What I do know is since Goons cleared RA out of Period Base, the so called Greater Western Co-Prosperity Sphere moved in and grew rapidly.
---
Fraternity. Treasury is our renter alliance mainly in WC and SC. The whole renter program is basically been managed by 2 person, one of them haven't login for 3 months and the last time I get to chat with him on QQ(Chinese Whatsapp/MSN/Whatsapp/Whatever else) was like 1-2 months ago. The other guy is also our main logistic guy who probably only login to his Treasury account once a month.
---
Take this as a ad, our renter program is quite simple, and we get probably the lowest or 2nd lowest price throughout the game cuz our renter lands aren't that fruitful. The process is simple, it's fixed price for every system depending on their true-sec, you pay that fixed price, the place is yours for a month, end of story.
---
Since I blasted and chatted with a lot people who's against botting and actively talking about botters in our renter program, there are people PM me on reddit from time to time about certain bot toons or corp they found, and I do reflect them to the only management for a while until I stop. Here I apologize to all those guys, out of good will or not, PM'ed me, cuz **I GAVE UP**. 
---
Why? Because this is not what I signed up for. Every time there's a report I have to verify, go into our ESI or SSO or whatever you like to call it system, sometimes found the toon/corp in question didn't provide proper ESI access and that's another helldance I don't want to detail, and if I'm lucky, I can find out if this persons' tick is something like 23/7 or not really so, if so I will contact the management person and we will see if we need to inform the corp or simply kick them as whole, so far we've been keeping a good pace of [once a month cleanup](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Fraternity._Treasury/corporations). And to be honest, those PM's has been 50/50 positive/negative, and that's what make me frustrated. I still want to guess the best out of whoever PM'ed me but I can't help the feeling that there are people simply trolling me, and regardless, the whole process bores me and for quite a while I don't want to do anything about this game anymore. Here I shall repeat again, **this is not what I signed up for!**
---
Botters aren't really like what everyone described here as so easy to catch. They will apply like any usual corp, 15% tax, some with 5 or 10 toons, sometimes even with some toons over 80% on zkill, some just came in as one man corp and say he just want a ratting place for his super or whatsoevershit, and the hard part is, sometimes it's fucking true and they are not botters! But sometime they are! So if they paid and not botting we better let them have their whole month of rent without kicking them, thus I have to do the stupid dance I described above once every month, totally about 6-7 hrs stretching through 2-3 days because bob help me if I have to do this boring shit all in a single day . And I repeat and repeat again: **this is not what I signed up for!** I am here to play a fucking space ship shooting at each other game, not Work Like a IRS Inspector 2019.
---
Why are we against botting? Simple, you came in as a legit renter, you pay 2B, you are good for one month, we earn 2B. You came in as botter, you pay 2B, you get banned, high chance our 2B get wiped by CCP, good chance we earn nothing. Now answer me, why in a fucking world would we welcome bots? Then why I gave up? Simple, I rather give up 10B per mo for not doing the stupid dance I mentioned above, which is pushing me to the edge of winning EVE.
---
I doubt how many people would bother to read this wall of text, but if you reached here, I appreciate you. And I only wrote this because the line u/ccp_peligro tweeted *stop it or I'll huff and puff* make me feel, well, it's hard to say, but let's say I'm sad about it. It's like a cop blaming bartenders for selling beers to some guy who end up murdered someone. **Seriously, dude, stop tough talking and act like a bitch, do your huff and puff, I am fine either way.**
---
And of course, some Q&amp;A(?) in advance:
---
Q: Why don't you just do it for the good of the game?
---
A: 1st, fuck it this game means nothing to me if I no longer feels fun playing it. 2nd, kicking them is a half ass job, they will find a new home anyways, and I can assure you we are not even the top target of botters, we are just like a fallback-ish solution.
---
Q: Bullshit you guys still build all those supers/titans from botting money!
---
A: I already told you how our renter system work, we don't get percentage income from our renter, it's your problem if you can't do math. And btw, supers and titans are built by ore not ISK, and you don't need bot for rorqs CCPLS fix.
---
Q: If there are other botting place why your renters became this outstanding?

A: Because both WC and SC are so easily accessible, and that's why we are only the fallback solution for botters and they primarily run VNI's here, good bots don't appear on zkill. I am actually amazed that Period Base is actively being roamed and harvested, I would suggest to also roam around Omist which is famously been ran by a handful real human beings, Paragon Soul is actually a nice new found I recently got, and of course the good old doneland is always good, if you like north, Trio of Deklein, Branch and Tenal would work too. But of course the location I mentioned above aren't low hanging fruits like WC and SC, you are always welcomed to help hunting bots in our renter space, just don't PM me anymore since it's a waste of energy for you now.
---
Maybe I haven't seen them used WELL enough, but they've been pretty vulnerable to combat probing in my experience.
---
I’m already in TEST :)
---
also possible
---
If you don’t penalize them, they’re directly incentivized to continue to accept bots, since they lose nothing, and gain tax revenue, and bots have a lot of tax revenue. Alliances should be firmly penalized for harboring bots to motivate them to not do so.
---
I'm prepared to believe some rent because they want to chill with a bunch of friends, run a small corp or whatever, without having the obligations associated with actual alliance membership.  I admit they may not be in the majority though.
---
When I was a solo player I considered renting, just to have a system of my own.  Decided I didn't put enough hours in to justify the cost.  It wouldn't be unusual for players to want to do that though.
---
Jackdaw dropped from carrier. They jettisoned it and killed it. Low damage on it so it's easy to tell it was unpiloted
---
Use it in jita, crash your game?
---
This is a top tier post.
---
They should strive for what is objectively good.
---
Ive posted logs of at least one exec saying this (Red Alliance)
---
They love to try and derail the conversation. The point is, and always was, "If you think they're botting, hit that Report Bot button."
---
But these guys love to try and steer the conversation away with tangential shit that doesn't really matter. Stuff like "Why is out the player's job to police one another!" "How are you able to tell who is a bot and who isn't a bot!" and other bullshit.
---
Those kind of questions, while cute and may have potential for some interesting discussion, still miss the original point of, "If you think they're a bot, report them" which anyone can do.
---
There’s a lot of very clear botting ongoing in certain alliances for which they are 100% responsible. They reap the rewards in the form of tax and rental income, so it’s important to incentivize them not to harbor those bots.
---
thank you for posting, 9/10 because im deaf:)
---
Take fleet, go get fight. Timers don't generate fights anymore, shitting up local generates fights.
---
Oh I see.  I thought it was a dig at Mittani, PBUH.
---
Hunt yourself
---
Is hitting "Report bot" button a couple of times really that much work for you?
---
I’m sorry?
---
The Ikitursa really needs a bonus to weapon ramp speed rather than ramp ceiling. It's just not viable as is for anything other than extended solo brawls where you know no backup is coming for your victim.
---
Looks like, as per usual, they have learned absolutely nothing.
---
Holy shit, someone trying to fill the hole in my heart that Guard left.
---
ESI key’s give you a lot of capability. In addition, you can test in game by doing blue tackle and similar to see if they respond.
---
Who is policing whom?
---
Just hit the Report Bot button and let CCP deal with it.
---
I think the only solution is an auto-replacing cyno jammer that is relatively easy to bash into downtime, but that defending logistics doesn't manually need to repair or replace.
---
I almost wonder if this is in preparation for an overhauled newbie experience? Like, I know the game only has the bare minimums of a "tutorial", but actually having a pointer to relevant icons would be an A+ addition.
---
In their tongue hes Botahkin, the Botborn
---
KWG when?
---
Perfect skilled hecate with void and 3 magstabs and hull tank rigs does around 750 dps, chimera with 2 adaptive invulns, 2 navy enams and a dcuii has around 70% kin/therm resist on shield/armor and 60 on hull levels so around 14-18 minutes to do 200k damage.
---
I think it self destructed or was damaged prior to the fight because even with not the best skills it should have 325-350k raw hitpoints.= with a 2500mm plate.
---
This is exactly why CCP should be taking a firmer stance on alliances harboring botters. No one should ever have a reaction like this of ‘who cares if they bot I make money off it.’ It should instead be ‘I need to get rid of these bots or I’m gonna lose all my money.’
---
OK but really... you're going to spend your precious time in-game doing that?
---
Why not both
---
I have a good faith belief that the use of this material in such a fashion is not authorized by the copyright holder, the copyright holder's agent, or the law.

i have a krab alt corp with 100% tax that i run my vni/rorq alts in, it simplifies moving my vni money around since it's all in the corp wallet and i don't have to do 5 individual transfers every time i want to have my money
---
If you can trace all assets that comes from bots, do that mean that you will start to confiscate infrastructures if a corp used taxes from a bot, to pay for the infrastructure or if they bought/mined minerals to build the structure with from bots assets?  
---
Could that be a way to punish alliances that habour botters?
---
Good and informative post
---
sounds good let's ban brisc again
---
GSF policy is to not have any corporations with an API registered with any public killboard. (Enforcement of that just started, so we have a few odd birds still.) Killboards aren't perfect intel devices.
---
You're right about that, yours is definitely self explanatory
---
there is no such thing as "minimal effort" for a bot
---
Nerfs to drone-based AFK PvE **would** be helpful to control bots, because forcing a bot to interact more with the client makes it easier to detect. But CCP has fucked over the earning potential of most other subcaps that alphas have access to over the years.
---
The balance of ratting income is all kinds of fucked up and it actively promotes the shitty AFK method. CCP needs to have a real rethink about anoms, earning potential, and the bad incentives they've created over the years.
---
As an ex-WHer, this is pretty accurate.
---
I'm not sure that's even remotely close to what he said.
---
I haven't played in about 3 years and this shit got me feeling 1337 as fuck
---
Thank you. I guess I’m just surprised. Feels like there’s more to the story here but can’t figure out what. Can a Hecate speed tank fighters or solo defang a whole carrier before it dies?
---
That still gives a higher chance to catch them.
---
EVERYONE LIKED THAT
---
both thb. also broke.
---
So new to carrier ratting... I’m entirely 100% safe to simply watch local?  No need for scouts up the pipe?  Standby of a cyno alt?   
---
Just when a neut hits local that’s plenty of time to recall fighters, align, find a jump point or warp to a structure or something?
---
Too many vowels.
---
How is an AFK ratter as bad as a botter? Beside the fact that AFK ratters don't violate the EULA, they are a 100% certain kill for anyone hunting VNIs.
---
&gt;manages a rental program for people who love to bot
---
&gt;why are there so many bots, this is not what i signed up for!! 
---
[pikachu]
---
Are there a whole lot of boosh raven fleets out there I'm not seeing on the killboards? Is there some crazy all-in doctrine switch by every alliance in game to them?
---
Stitch for CSM 14 .
---
Already sorta happens. FRT got negwalleted and consequently dropped sov in a few systems because CCP removed a large amount of botted isk.
---
This sounds like a job for a `Deep Learning' NN + Graduate Student.  
---
Just saying...
---
You kind of just ignored his points, and ranted further about what he already addressed..
---
Yay, reading comprehension!
---
You clearly have never heard of a VPN. Region locking China won’t do shit
---
Do you guys do anything about input broadcasting or is the ban on it just for show
---
I see the spin brigade has a new argument.
---
CCP don't want "the community to police this". What they do want though is the community to not actively obstruct it, to tell people not to report suspicious bots, or to overlook blatant botting in their alliances and renters.
---
Please stop pretending it's normal to do other people's job for no pay. It isn't.
---
Golden
---
You're talking about the same CCP who banned Brisc without looking at the evidence based on other people's words and then had to rescind it? Or the same CCP who warned me based on other people's words without looking at the evidence and then had to rescind it. When I was a bright eyed newbee I would have 100% thought what Mittani said was retarded but now it seems like wisdom from someone who has been burnt multiple times before. It took me having the same experience and seeing it applied to others to change my mind.
---
Thanks will do. Do you have his name by any chance
---
And is he trustworthy, lots of people tell some eve players are like predetory hawks
---
says killah, who funded his vanquisher with money he got from IWI. maybe you should have looked into their operation before you took the contract, after all you reaped the benefits from people who were obviously RMTing. i don't recall you being too happy about your frozen wallet at the time, and afaik you were never punished for reaping said benefits. 
---
of course, i don't think you should have been punished because it's not your job to police RMTing. but i don't see how you can reconcile the two
---
Generally if someone has the name of "opiiwjfpwjnpf wfpiwaoefp", they're a bot.
---
I mean I have a vni alt I use specifically for increasing ADMs. The VNIs are just like ammo to me.
---
There's legitimate uses
---
When /u/wallymartseve, true ruler of all of new eden sits upon the iron throne ( or gets elected to CSM).
---
Goonwaffe should be banned but only because it's full of terrible posters
---
I mean, you still lose a shit ton of VNIs semi-afk
---
not just your average linemember, he's a recruitment officer isn't he?
---
This is going in my favorites folder
---
😁
---
The reality is that Brisc's banning was probably an honest mistake. The CSM was created because of cheating by CCP employees, and then CCP execs hear that a CSM member is doing the same thing? Yea, they were far to quick to drop the ban hammer, but could you imagine the uproar if he really was cheating and it came out that they had ignored the reports?
---
The correct thing would have been to quietly suspend his account, contact him directly, and investigate things professionally, but that's only with the hindsight of Brisc's reaction. Without him going on the offensive like that, what they did would have totally been the right move. If he'd have just been defensive and whiny, everybody would have shouted him down and that would have been the end of it.
---
smh can't believe ccp plagiarized this gem of a game
---
one does not just walk into eve and hunt bots.  you must first build an army of alts and stalk your prey.  Only have ages of time of tracking and figuring out their pattens will you be able to kill a few.  Also, those that you kill will be replaced in an hour and nobody will be any the poorer.
---
8/10 players on this sub quickly looking up what V does.
---
So that's what the worn stub of a key between C and B is?
---
I'm not Killah Bee btw... i thought that was obvious with the meme account name. But while were at it i wonder what about the IWI rmt was obvious for people who did not have access to their wallets.
---
Testing, testing..... yup, sorry was just checking my keyboard still works.
---
Yeah, it’s part of my role as an alliance director. You’ve got some basic responsibilities when organizing a group of people, especially when you profit from their actions. I take great delight in hunting and purging bots, it generally goes someone reports or we detect, verify status as bot, kill any characters they have in space, kick from alliance, report to CCP. Alliances should at the very least be kicking blatant bots like the ones you see in Frat all the time.
---
As a current one, it's still pretty accurate :D
---
I read this whole thing in an angry Jackie Chan’s voice including animated tantrums and I SIMPLY CANNOT UPVOTE IT HARD ENOUGH.  
---
+1 my good man.  And I hope they listen to some of this because there’s some truth to it.
---
Then a) they should not be playing this game because they clearly can’t separate reality from a video game, b) as long as your response to these bots is the same as any other bots you shouldn’t have any issues, and c) CCP will hopefully take down any accounts linked to the bots.
---
*It's not what you signed up for* but somehow you're running a rental program with a high chance some or most of your renters are botters.  If you don't want to deal with it, don't run the programme.
---
This isn't difficult.
---
&gt; What's unacceptable is repeatedly harboring cheaters, profiting from it, announcing to your alliance that they shouldn't report bots because it's lucrative to tax them.
---
Sounds a lot different than "Do our job and investigate every corp/player you have for botting!" I'm not really understanding the backlash here. What Peligro said is basically common sense (for non-scumbags, I guess) - Don't intentionally encourage botting by discouraging your people from reporting them because you want ISK. Basically, if you stand to make money off botting, CCP is gonna take care of that particular income stream. Seems completely fine to me.
---
Wasn't last week, but it wasn't that long ago. I had replied to an idiot. The amount of people in PB at the time was negligible. These bots were new.
---
I mean, its still better than a vedmak.
---
How about CCP just do their damn job and ban all botters so we don't have this stupid conversation? Half of nullsec are in fact renter space, and everyone is running their renter program somehow same way, why do we deserve this botting bullshit?
---
This is both amazing for teaching new folks as well as great meme potential.
---
So are you single? 
---
Because I think I'm in love.
---
If everybody stopped running rental programmes, where would the botters have to go?
---
mittani in a 'fireside chat' said that reporting alliance botters was bluefucking and nobody should do it because it was 'impossible for anyone to know if someone was a botter'.
---
Woulda been kinda terrible to cease and desist a soase mod but leaving this alone :,D
---
HAHAHA, GET **FUCKED**, OASA.
---
That used to be a nice neighborhood. Co prosperity moved in.
---
killah is killahwasp, i always forget which is the meme account.
---
the point is that it doesn't matter whether or not it's obvious. it's simply not on us to do that shit. i have horse in this race either way, and I'm pretty OK with assets (e.g. isk gemerated) being traced and removed. but if there are going to be more serious punishments for simply not wanting to do boring admin, then i think that's bullshit
---
Nice to see a video from you. The PvP was good and the memes were just right.   
---
Another!
---
Whether or not CCP actually follows through with significant action in droves, or at all, is on them. Clearly by this post existing in the first place, something is being done, but my guess is that rescinding isn't common in the case of botting, or at least I personally haven't heard of any false positives being found. What other option do we have, realistically? Either we let bots bot, which fucks EVERYTHING up, or CCP starts asking US to put in the heavy research and legwork, which makes them look even worse, especially in the light of the Brisc trials.
---
My point still stands that I care enough about this game to not be apathetic towards arguably the biggest issue it currently faces, and I'd hope other people would, too.
---
Good luck pushing that idea to everyone.
---
By Jove! Which is, of course, to say, by myself.
---
What about her emails tho
---
&gt; Just when a neut hits local that’s plenty of time to recall fighters, align, find a jump point or warp to a structure or something?
---
if you're not ratting aligned to a structure already i don't know what to say really. Why would you *eve* want to jump out instead of just warping to tether is beyond me.
---
&gt; It should be in the interest of every fair normal player to disrupt cheaters as much as possible. 
---
I mean... yeah, but you gotta think about the overall objective.  It *is* in the interest of players to disrupt cheaters, but the *reason* is that we all want a level playing field, without external influences (botting software).  Ultimately, it would be better if the game was healthy without it being made that way by players.
---
I am a casual player, and kind of new.  I logged out two days ago.  Logged in today, and appeared in my item hanger (I logged out in a system I don;'t have anything in), was The Yulai Siege.  Appears to just be some lore.   What is this and why did it show up?
---
That is not what that means.
---
He did.  But I would interpret that in a charitable way: it didn't mean go forth and bot.  The locals don't like bots anymore than anyone else does.  It meant accusing each other of botting is (1) divisive and (2) gives directors a massive headache they don't want to deal with.  (1) is true, as some proportion of complaints/reports will be wrong.  And (2) is understandable.  It's a game.
---
With the exception of officers the loot is about the same, and the salvage is exactly the same. The only difference is officer spawns which only appear in belts, but were for a long time the only source of officer modules. These spawns are incredibly rare though and can be extremely dangerous if you don't know how to handle them.
---
Brave recruitment at least takes reports of bots seriously and we do follow up with stuff like this.
---
My point is I don't know who is and isn't a bot, I can't tell. If I report someone who isn't one and CCP just bans them, which is what appears happens to a lot of people, then I have hurt them. I don't care about downvotes, virtue signal all you want nerds.
---
"b-b-b-but you can't generalize an entire player group as cheaters!!1!1!"
---
I'm not pushing it as an idea.  Just pointing out that it's a bit stupid to complain about your renters botting when the solution is not to let our system for rent.
---
Some fell, more will arise
---
I wonder how longer CCP could keep up the ban hammer
---
&gt;Treasury just now... Stop it, or I'll huff and puff
---
what did he mean by this?
---
It's strange how CCP ban the botters just after they join Goonswarm, rather than in the five years beforehand when they were botting in someone else's space.
---
Ohhhh so be aligned and watching local... maybe there’s more that can be done to maintain a safe carrier ratting procedure...
---
I’m sensing a pattern
---
I suppose if you do it enough it eventually reduces, as people get the memo.
---
i think booshers should get at least 3 maybe 4 booshes before any negative effects get forced onto them. That way you can still spear fish in fights, evade, and run fleets that have  small core of booshers. When its 3 or 4 booshes in a row thats where it gets a little stupid imo
---
Yeah this ship is good for one thing and one thing only.

---
would you say a removal of the isk would be ok though even after changing hands? honestly curious which extent of punishment for botters and consequences to their aquired goods you would deem acceptable.  
---
btw killah has a new account called ItsKillahBee or something with a CSM flair and all.
---
oh god im cumming
---
the ESS was something on my list/description that i'd like to see updated. I want more pvp/conflict drivers in space. The ESS has so much potential, but CCP have ignored it for awhile now and left it to being gamed by being put in burner missions and full spawned anoms.   
---
If i were to help provide input on structures like this, I would be very adamant in that they not be gamed so easily. Whether or not CCP listens is up to them, but i'd certainly voice my opinion.
---
yes you can do more work for the exact same results all you want, more news at 11
---
CCP rescinding bans isn't common *at all*, it only happens when you've got enough people willing to highlight the fact that they fucked up. Let's see them demonstrate *competence* before asking us to trust them. Because lately, they've demonstrated just the opposite.
---
dam straight it is :)
---
you can never fully exclude cheaters from a game, they will always show up. the way eve is designed isnt at all making it harder.
---
that's gold
---
Will you be taking more proactive action against the bot users that bot for say, 4 hours a night and *sometimes* run other activities in their accounts in the meantime? I’ve seen this type of botting activity a few times in eve and it is never punished quickly, if at all; I hunted belt ratting tengu bots in fountain that still operated for literally years despite providing video evidence of the botting system they were using and using the  appropriate channels. I suspect that there is no proper process for determining that these are in fact bots because they a) do not perma run or run for a relatively small amount of time per a day b) intersperse these activities with actual play time from the botting player. So whilst I appreciate the work you do, I still see players botting in 0.0 when I hang around areas for days and weeks and get to know particular areas of space and it sucks. I feel like I could run a bot and never be caught on my main and regularly used alts using this methodology.
---
I can get behind this religion!

still better vr then all vr by ccp...
---
His comment was buried in the thread. 
---
Also let him be more careful next time as most of us so vilified goons are actually loyal and lawful customers. 
---
So yeah i will not do CCP's job. Let them actually invest in the security team.
---
I love the game as much as you and just like you i dont want it to collapse to botting.

Where are the botters for TEST? Kids with Guns? Goons? Why put on the spot "Fraternity" and not anyone else that has been exploiting this issue long before even Fraternity came up to live....or are we so judgmental that we are pointing fingers in one direction because they are Chinese? This has been the issue here for the past months....always blaming Fraternity for botting but turning our heads the other way when someone else is using this same exploit. You mention 2 here.....why not mention the rest??
---
Awesome, now people can shut the fuck up about CCP not doing anything about the bot problem.
---
so out of 600 bans how many need to be re-reviewed with a second investigation?
---
When did ccp start calling out alliances by name for having botters?  I seem to recall them going out of their way to avoid that before
---
Already respected your game and fitting knowledge. Can count on my vote.
---
Did Thunder Fighter make more money than  EVE Valkyrie ?
---
No fighters in tubes no fighter killmails. It's possible that it was ratting warped to a citadel/safe and got probed and didn't call the fighters back on grid with it or abandon them and launched more and just self destructed or died.

---
Fraternity. Treasury are the renters of fraternity alliance. So taking that in context: 
---
\&gt; Banned \~600 bots mostly all in Greater Western Co-Prosperity Sphere and Fraternity. Treasury just now...
---
Means exactly that.
---
\&gt; stop it or I'll huff and puff...
---
According to the Cambridge Dictionary "huff and puff" means "**to** [**complain**](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/complain) [**loudly**](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/loud) **and** [**express**](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/express) [**disapproval**](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/disapproval)".
---
Ok. I guess I just missed that one. Thanks. Any long term point to the lore items?
---
CSM a fuck, go away Jordan Peterson “Watch my 300 hours of videos”
---
start removing ISK of whole alliances that are involved in that shit.
---
They would pretend to be normal members like me and you, talking to you in comms while running a bajilion bots. That is what they would do. At least they concentrate in renting areas... 
---
Nuke? surprise incursion?  Triglavians? Squeek?
---
that can go sideways so fast.. Go to enemy alliance bot, watch their economy collapse.
---
Do you even think?
---
Yeah. I mean it's totally possible for us to miss stuff. But following up on concerns from membership isn't too hard and sends a clear message on our stance.
---
Nothing can ring the sweet, sweet bells of justice quite like the ban hammer.  
---
Spiral out, keep going.
---
We may not be that major but Brave takes a strong stance against botting in our ranks.
---
&lt; null static into esoteria
---
&lt; tapi autists please ignore

&lt; behead a vni in YAP ( in game )
---
&lt; tapi gets arused, get wh camped by numale virgins in boson titants, so we cant roll it
---
&lt; entire corp goes back to mordhau
---
Then Predditors might be a good fit. When we have our hotdropping operation up we catch a fair amount of bots. The cloaky campers either stop them from undocking or they whitelist us and we drop on them.
---
How much of a wallet hit to an alliance is that 600 bot ban going to be?
---
Nice to see a ban wave on 4/25
---
How about silently report and move the fuck on with your life?
---
in game
---
Ok, bye bye.
---
Lol, I always use the mouse for 360, I only use V for 5°scans.
---
That's the whole point, CCP has consistently shown that they do not have a working process for reports. So if the player isn't a bot and they get banned because of my report I just contributed to that. I do not want to be part of that.
---
"i would hate for afk vnis to get nerfed"
---
Think it's you who needs to be fucking off, sweetie.
---
Bitch more, slyce tears are the best kind :joy:
---
Botting is in no way the player's job to fix. Why should we be having to clean up after players breaking the EULA? Why should it not be CCP's job to enforce their rules? Fucking retard.
---
Nah just lets you know some of stuff that players in general have got up to since the start of EvE
---
I wish you luck then.
---
Nice try. That link goes to Stitch_K's YouTube EVE Online PvP channel. No Peterson stuff that I saw...
---
I was not there for major battles like Asakai. But the one large scale battle I fondly remember was the Battle of MTO2-2 when GoTG tried dropping a keep star in the drone regions.
---
We spent hours ferrying ships into staging, and then when it was time, we had got bridged into position. At this point, someone linked in fleet the intro to the PS2 CoD Russian campaign, where the commisar is giving a speech about not one step back. Felt really appropriate for what we were trying to do. The fleet I was a part of, an arty Abaddon fleet, was almost immediately targeted by Machariels from I believe was Unspoken, and followed by a Frat ferox fleet that landed almost on top of us. Followed by a swarm of fighters from nearby carriers. I, somehow, managed to keep my Abaddon alive, only to lose that same ship a week later to a Boson when the fleet got dragged into a bubble in front of a PL titan.
---
We eventually ended up killing the keep keepstar through sheer numbers.
---
The nerfs won't affect it at all, it gets the same dps, the shield kite fit still fits without any problems, and the AB fleet fits just need a 1% implant and they'll be as good as they were before
---
&gt;Goons?
---
Literally mentioned in the tweet before frat.
---
You dont know what they have and dont have for reports process. For anecdotal reference, I can say that I reported dozens of players I suspected as bots over the past few weeks just from roaming Period Basis and Paragon Soul. Lo and behold, 600 bots from one of those areas gone. Did I contribute to it? Maybe. 
---
That's all they want. Don't read anything more into it. See something, report it, and move on. They will take care of it. What they don't want is some nerd screaming about buddy fucking someone and saying don't report at all, cause that hinders the fight against cheaters more than anything.

Not EVE, but check out screeps.

It's almost as if there's a "narrative" to be pushed.
---
I love the video they linked further down that reply chain. Haha.
---
You seem to be totally ignoring the point that players have been reported many times before and been punished by CCP for things they didn't do. If you report them you are contributing to that. I don't want to make it seem like this is a giant moral issue, but if I helped someone lose their account for something they weren't doing I would feel at fault. I'm not going to be part of that, if you report them to CCP you are part of it.
---
That's like saying, "I carry a lighter, a syringe, a spoon and a leather belt with me, but that doesn't mean I do heroin." 
---
It's a strong indicator for investigation.
---

Did you record this fight? It was fun https://zkillboard.com/kill/76519775/
---
Hope you don't suddenly get banned, cause you have my vote!
---
this is true. do not trust anyone
---
and do not forget this fact :)
---
IIRC they were the Guristas Ace of Podhunters SKINs.
---
This certainly aged well.
---
Actually no, the v key is inconveniently placed, I always have Dscan open, I just constantly refresh with the mouse, need to the left hand free for my push to talk key most of the time. People complain when I'm hunting that I drop off comms because I'm 5° scanning anoms.
---
Yeah, that's what recruitment feels like at times. 
---
"I'll fly my carrier into your wormhole to move my stuff." 
---
"We live in a C2." 
---
"You can't have capitals in wormhole space? thats awful!"
---
"Well, not exact-"
---
"I think I'm going to stay in my current alliance, I'm making a lot of isk from ratting."
---
&gt; You seem to be totally ignoring the point that players have been reported many times before and been punished by CCP for things they didn't do
---
I feel like you're just saying this without backing it up with anything. It's almost like a straw man that you are building up to knock down.
---
In any case, it really comes down to suspected botter's word versus CCP's. Who are you willing to give the benefit of the doubt to? A video game company that has the internal auditing tools to verify reports, or a person who has his reputation to lose, not to mention actual dollar cost of lost assets (or profits, if botting for RMT)?
---
Just remove 150% of what they earned in taxes from the bot.
---
Noticed a drop in explo bots about a week and a half ago, oddly enough about the same time Blizzard had a ban wave. Will we get a break down of what kind of bots were banned and numbers in each alliance? And is the lack of asteros related to this?
---
 No
---
Ah. I see. I thought he meant something else by 'Treasury'.
---
inb4 accusations of racism
---
100% of nullsec alliances is renting their space, the diplo/managerial part of the game practically revolves around it at this point. Renting is one of two remaining  passive incomes for the alliances now when moon mining has changed.
---
V is for rookies, gotta bind it to one of your mouse side buttons
---
Prepare for the botting/renter apologists posting "BuT HoW Do YoU KnOw ThEy WeRe BoTtInG?"
---
I feel like when you're 5 degree scanning is the most important time to be on comms lol
---
I love you, I know we have never met, but ya know, I can't help it.
---
"Sure I may have a gun, a ski mask, and a bag with a dollar sign on it... But I'm not going to rob a bank"
---
You can - all botters are cheaters for example.
---
Init takes action against bots, very publicly. Were encouraged to report any bots to our leadership to get them out.
---
Spoiler: It types "V" for "Ve are ze Vormholers".
---
I carry the lighter for my smokes, a spoon coz the bastards at KFC keep forgetting it for the potato and gravy, I use the syringe to fill with water and squirt it at people on the train, and the belt to hold up my pants.
---
This is posted in literally every thread to do with China and/or botting.
---
You can't access Tranquility from an Internet connection within the PRC without a VPN. This is why Serenity exists in the first place. Anyone who is in China and wants to play on TQ is running EVE through a VPN. So posting that Tiananmen Square winnie the pooh copypasta isn't going to help much either.
---
People really need to think for longer than five seconds before petitioning CCP to do something the Chinese government already does for them.
---
Sad but so funny
---
Yeah, he does it clean according to his advert.
---
He has a max skilled toon that creates the corp and alliance then transfers ceo to your toon.
---
So there's nothing for him to steal.
---
Eh, unfortunately, it really can't be done with my current system, I have an idea to change it, but I would need to reassign dscan to one of my extra mouse keys.
---
Is that how it's done now? Used to get sun bounced if it died mid-jump. 
---
That was always an ass clencher.
---
Hardly. Gunjack 1 I've played some time ago was A W E S O M E.
---
more absurd
---
Jesus Christ that's a lot of bots
---
It wasn't a new sentence, the name of the corp is "Fraternity. Treasury"
---
The future is now.
---
Sorry, no. Should be easy to search and honestly you need to get used to googling for eve answers anyways :)
---
For once.
---
Yes, they do.  They shouldn't.  The End.
---
I took it to mean 'stop it or I'll huff and puff, and blow your house down' , I hope FRT and Goons built their houses out of bricks...
---
Are you going to focus on NPC lore or rather on a player lore? (both are canon)
---
I said this somewhere else, bind dscan to mouse side button and never look back. It's amazing
---
Shouldn't be hard to stop if you spend a nanosecond looking at corp wallets to verify nobody is ratting for 16+ hours a day.
---
maybe you should do it then, and if you cba and get punished for it, suck it up because it's what you asked for
---
yeah except that's not what ccp said at evesterdam. they specifically indicated that alliances qua alliances would need to clamp down on botting or face punishment. and that's peligro is not-so-subtly hinting at here.  
---
it's not just a case of 'report bots if you see them'. which, btw, you ALSO shouldn't have to do.
---
Yeah I'm not running again, I'm really glad that Stitch Kaneland is though!. With Insidious Sainthood, Cable UTA and Stitch Kaneland all running now there are an ample amount of candidates that really know their solo/small gang stuff.
---
Ive seen this issue only when using too many drone nav computers and the drone speed implant on the rorq woth light drones, so youll prolly want to file a big report
---
VNI botters are actually probably hard to detect. Most botters are not stupid enough to actually go 23/7 and outside of their response to player probing, they probably do exactly the same thing as any player. VNI ratting is pretty 1-dimensional.
---
This recent spike of interest in hunting is probably unironically helpful to bot searching. Let's keep at it!
---
You certainly know your stuff good sir, you'll be on my vote. :)
---
Cool video - never seen industry look so good (although it still wont get me to mine or build). 
---
But the song is excellent - great appropriate composition
---
\- well done
---
wormholer btw
---
it's almost as if i'm not in goons or even an affiliated alliance, although by virtue of being in any alliance there's probably some guy botting in either our alliance or our rental alliance.
---
The inevitable commenter who points out the obvious. The hero we need.
---
Is that the new “I’m not racist but...” ? 
---
It does sound like it 😕
---
Prolly caldari
---
Probably, there are many people playing on Serenity and TQ at the same time
---
That Aura voice. So immersive.
---
Would be nice to have that again :&lt;
---
Next you know they'll be telling people to take down fan art because it's showing their IP....
---
Unb4 someone links warp to sun button to a tethered titan
---
Wingspan is usually found around B274 wormholes, especially near big trade hubs. Mostly harmless once you figure out their operations style. Seem to be decent people outside the game. Praise Bob
---
Use push to talk on mouse like everyone else?
---
oh sure, but I'm implying that goon hate, justified or not, has become a familiar comforting thing that we choose to keep.    
---
Weather it is out of necessity or goons deserve it, its completely beside the point.  grr goons makes us all feel good. including the goons.
---
You want to hunt things that dont shoot back?
---
I remapped my V to spacebar in the early days because I joined a FW corp (at the time).
---
yeah sorry, killahwasp is kb's reddit account. i always get confused by you guys, they're both pretty memey names.  
---
anyway, my point is that in that scenario, it simply isn't killah's responsibility to go and investigate whether those guys were RMTing or not. that's ccp's responsibility, and if you can't see how bad outcomes could come from this, i think you're pretty naive. ccp came -this- close to completely fucking init as an alliance a few weeks ago, over what turned out to be literally nothing but shitty conjecture on their part. you really want them to apply those excellent standards of judgment to entire alliances at a time?
---
I think we should have 7 booshes before penalties for reasons.
---
What I'm saying is that modern Goon hate is literally its own meme, and doesn't actually have anything to do with reality.  
---
it doesn't matter who the next bad guys are, we will still be grring goons in 10 years.
---
Found the salty botter
---
That's the worst idea in the history of bad ideas, maybe ever.
---
V ? Space bar D-Scan FTW
---
Can't say I've followed it that much, but PIBC isn't in one of the renter alliances right? So presumably if it were mainly PIBC they would be the ones being named and shamed.
---
Oh look more racism awesome
---
... and they're back!
---
Absolutely remove all the isk they generated but the  *X times the amount* can be exploited. Fallow the isk and neg it, fallow their assets and remove them, put them to the torch of course. 
---
**But you cannot put that work load on us the players. Its huge and unfair.**
---
1. We dont have the tools, what you expect playerrs to write software to parse ESI  so we can police ourselfs???  What would CCP job be then? cause you just turned my 2-4 hrs of fun into a 12 hrs JOB.
---
2. Considering they would give us the tools, do you really trust me with a banhammer? MUHAHHAHAHA ... yeah that goes bad fast.
---
**We need an impartial and capable overseer, the CCP for goon or worse must step up and pump more ISK into their security team.**
---
Doubt the economy could handle that.
---
C2&gt;NS static guy. Do this.
---
Not remapping D-scan to spacebar? What kind of filthy casual are you? wormholer btw
---
Not enough séríslenskur.
---
My brain doesn’t bend that far. Off to bed i guess
---
1 day old account btw :v
---
Reasons include:
---
Grrr goons?
---
How many are lawyers?
---
Yeah CCP's blatant racism banning poor chinese players is not ok!
---
What happened to alliances being punished if they harboured bots
---
I want a Triglavian prop mod
---
I know, and for the moment, I love it
---
explains why he keeps recruiting mega retards then?
---
More like i got 2 trillion reasons in my wallet
---
Same likelihood as you stopping?
---
Wild guess.
---
This is Eve.
---
There was a similar sized ban back in January, before they moved. Doesn't seem like a connection to me.
---
Reddit automatically removes quickmeme.com. This is good because your post is terrible.
---
People from cultures that actively encourage cheating are cheating?! You don't say...
---
So how many times will test violate their no anti chinese spam pledge with PIBC in this thread?
---
150% of 0% is still 0%.
---
The Gallente militia thanks everyone for their support.
---
pictures or it did not happen.
---
PIBC aren't set up in a capacity where they can bot yet, but the PIBC affiliated PLA bots that have been infesting Period Basis ever since the announcement definitely can't be a cooinidence.
---
Being critical of anyone of a different race is racism, k?
---
Too late
---
^ this guy wormholes
---
While I agree with your point that straight buffing low class WH is a bad idea, I am pointing at other options to increase the attractiveness to settle there.  Pilots who want nothing but ISK/Hour have far safer and more lucrative regions.  Gas for example was a solid approach, make specific gases available only in specific holes (by class).  The market forced to explore, exploit and settle.  Why not ore?  PI?  
---
WHs have always been the spooky unknown and while some familiarity is expected after so many years, I really don't want to see them becoming NS-light.  Citadels were a terrible implementation of a reasonable idea and the lazy copy/paste mentality of CCP of features designed for K-space into WH further denudes us of unique value.  WHs have effects, why can't citadels tap into that for some manufacturing bonus?  Or Moon goo extraction?  Or... 
---
Anyway - at this point, lets hope that CCP truly has forgotten about us or the next patch sees mission agents, jumping to/from WH space and WH stabilizers... (all of them frequent ideas spouted by sad K-space dwellers)
---
Lastly, lets please all file away this tale of "WH were never intended to be settled".  That's a ancient history and shattered holes, Citadels, Thera etc all show us that CCP has embraced the concept of ordinary J-space to be settled normally.  If anything, I want WH space to get back to its roots, be the place where only the slightly mad can truly thrive.  &lt;MadMax&gt;
---
"PRIMARY IS GHFDRTTFGBJUTUUFF!"
---
Just rolls of the tongue.
---
are you sure it was ever like that for nonbridged ships? i remember seeing a post at least 3 years old saying only bridged ships land on the sun if the cyno died mid jump
---
So why do rats show up on the travel, looting, and mission presets? I could see the reason for the mission one but they clutter up the travel and loot/salvage one quite a bit. Also the anom/loot/ratting presets, to name a few, might be improved by removing stations/citadels from them.
---
"Greater Western Co-Prosperity Sphere" is Goons renter alliance.
---
You're welcome, retard. Nice try at playing the race card though.
---
Don't worry, it's silent anyway :P
---
[https://youtu.be/Vz-xxIQvZMg](https://youtu.be/Vz-xxIQvZMg)
---
Actually building a carrier in a c2 does one of two things:  Get you a swarm of murderers or scares the shit out of a casual bash gang.  There is no inbetween.
---
ofc, more fun that way.
---
A lot of alliances support botters pretty openly.
---
when I was in GSF, they used some random chat room tool and the main pve chat room was basically only used to discuss bots and input broadcasting and the likes.
---
Hundreds of people were in this chat, including what must be dozens of people from alliance leadership.
---
They didnt mind care about botting, and I doubt GSF is the only group thats like this.
---
Thats what i'm looking for
---
looks promising!!!
---
it's not like we are getting any VR around here, anytime soon..
---
And Then invade any country on earth if they don't apply with our demands
---
Flair bait... :|
---
MAKE BATTLESHIPS GREAT AGAIN
---
correct brain think here
---
Bravo na tebe mitko
---
yeah I'm finding it really hard to tell the damavik and leshak apart on this graph
---
like whoa which is which!
---
It is their job to enforce the rules of accounts breaking the EULA. It is also our obligation to report suspects so CCP can gather information so they can identify trends and create paper trails on accounts to correctly prosecute offenders correctly without having a Brisc Rubal screw up.
---
If players didn't find trends of suspicious activity with how the bots work, then CCP probably wouldn't have ever found them. Great collaboration on both sides will be the undoing of botting. Not a whiney bitch crying about  inflation  of in game items, and crying about all the reasons why the inflation is occurring, but refusing to say/do anything about it.
---
See, proper delivery agents stick around while the recipient checks the package to make everything is set and only leave once they have a confirmation message.  Gotta keep up the customer satisfaction - it's worth the time!
---
Chunky Milk &lt;3
---
They ban in waves, and this is far from the first time.....
---
Brave is underrated tbh
---
What did you have against diabetic smokers with lucky spoons?
---
Take this fucking upvote 😂😂😂😂😂
---
Definitely doing that though
---
Real pros have it bound to the spacebar.
---
I had to down vote because you were on '421 points' , sorry. 
---
**+ 1**
---
https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99007871/
---
not botters btw /s
---
It's a cute idea but there are so many things wrong with it. First and foremost, it would just cause leadership to discourage people from actually doing the most useful thing at stopping botting, reporting them. Why? Because it's not something they can feasibly control and it would be the best way to mitigate random wallet loss. This already happened with Mittani defending bots about a year ago.
---
The only thing players should be welcomed to do in the war against botting is to report. There's no need to make it more complicated than it already is.
---
Most of the market bots I've seen are NPC corp.
---
There are a bunch doing endless loops in space around Jita and Amarr.  All alpha, and in a variety of ships to throw one off their trail ... but they never dock, and just keep going around and around and ...
---
TAPI when ? Goons, NCdot, PL, **ME**, when ?
---
The huff and puff part is more a reference to the three little pigs where the wolf huffed and puffed and blew down the houses of two of the pigs. The part after the ... would be "and blow your house down" Likely meaning he will go after things at a higher level (alliance level) next time.
---
I do see his point about the Kiki comparison though, I think rather than a problem with the Ikitursa it's probably the strength of the Kiki that is more problematic.
---
It's not but sometimes people's hate boner for me gets in the way of their ability to read or comprehend.
---
flair checks out
---
I don't quite see how you get the graphs you got there.
---
I've produced a spreadsheet that shows the Ikitursa first overtaking the Drekavac at 151 seconds(43 cycles) making it even worse than on your graph.
---
DM if if you wish to see, since this graph seems to mis represent it (unless I've fucked something up)
---
still sounds reasonable
---
I would say Sabre, 300i.
---
Seem like legit Klingon names to me.
---
I don't get the dog part and how it relates to Trigs but a dog being carried away by a drone is still funny.
---
Hey, when are you going to reverse my false ban?
---
Thats correct! You spam this so bind it to the biggest button there is!
---
Kiki is a bit overtuned yeah.
---
That's like my security cameras recording people break into your house.... Not my job to report it to you or the authorities. Figure it out yourself. While it truly is up to the authorities(ccp), wouldn't it be useful if other reported the issue so the problem can be corrected quicker due to a "paper trail" of reports.
---
Pretty much
---
As a W-space resident i was like if he doesnt say V i quit lol. That V is getting pushed subconsciouly even in HS and abyss sites lol.   
---
And the rorqual hahahahah we had a new recruit who brought a rorqual, as soon as he undocked it we told him you know it is already dead right? ''wtf u talking about'' man it is W-space, the question is not if you are gonna lose it or not, the question is when. He lost 2 of them, havent logged back since. poor guy hahahah
---
Remapped v to space bar like a good whore long ago
---
Help me understand the racism in this post.
---
Hell yeah, lots of returning vets go through the newbie pipeline and there's a lot of support for it. Ton of stuff is different so you might as well be new.
---
Ceptors are still useful. Combat ceptors (i.e. ranis, claw) are no longer nullified so not a main fleet doctrine which was kind of dumb anyway tbh
---
Low power mode already functionally removes one timer btw.
---
How would you feel about low power structures coming out of reinforce at the time of their reinforcement, rather than the timer set by the defenders? You fuel it, you get to pick the time. You don't fuel it, you don't get to pick.
---
Virtual machines can randomize their MAC addresses. This only catches script kiddies, so don't expect it to be a panacea.
---
This wave moved to PB the same week as the PIBC move, and were in a PIBC affiliated corp so I'd imagine that's where they came from.
---
Oh yeah? Name and shame.
---
hero we need != hero we deserve
---
actually, you can sometimes use them on nullsec idiots who jump into your WH and forget they can't bring their own supers/faxes in after you
---
Side note, I feel so vindicated by all this realization of the Kiki's strength lately. I've been saying it's incredibly strong especially in tracking/projection combo from day 1, and I was also the only person in my groups pointing out the shield kiki for solo when it was considered retarded to fit anything but armor.
---
I would argue that Navy BS are far too expensive for the relative bonuses you get out of them. Pirate battleships could maybe go up in price a bit, but ships like the rattle and nightmare are already in a pretty good spot, costing 300m+ more per ship than a T1 battleship.
---
There's some value to that as someone flying the ship. You have lots of different fitting options which let you surprise opponents who may assume, for example, that your scyfi is fit with RLMLs when in reality you're a brawly autocannon fit.
---
Didnt even need to read the post we need a good solo small gang guy on csm go stitch
---
Add your cyno alt to your watch list, you can right click and jump to from it
---
You prove my point quite well. Thank you.
---
Probably a Millenial too.
---
The CI's could tell you if those were left hand or right hand dominant keyboard slaps.
---
I wonder if there is a bot that makes bots yet?
---
First and foremost your companies shitty game design, management and marketing decisions regarding the development of the flaming pile of shit that Eve has become as well as their other projects made all of this possible in the first place. I´m the last one to deflect blame from the playerbase for its part in all of this because in a turboliberal virtual environment sustainibility is of secondary concern to most people. 
---
I know you´re personally not responsible, but as a official company representative i would keep the grandstanding to a minimum regarding this topic.
---
Interesting, I noticed some entities were auto-added after the game update.
---
I'll do a deep check of all and deploy a new version after fixing this.
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
I'm sure each one of us could find a way to burn it.
---
Love it lol, quality work.
---
Nothing. I don't have anything against heroin junkies either. 
---
My point is, if \[a\] detective explained away every clue with a logical hypothetical, we'd never have any solved cases.
---
Honestly, it's probably just timing. We recently received a large influx of renters formerly renting from B0T, because of the deleterious effects that have been inflicted on ihubs in The Spire.
---
I am confused.
---
*nullsec-er btw*
---
We've had the alliance for a very long time. It was our old rental alliance back when we were renting out part of the north. However, it was only recently pressed back into service as a rental alliance; a month and change ago.
---
Nothing besides preparedness and timing. I do it all the time, you'd be surprised at how many people forget their timers or when they hit that button. 
---
No one can see the timer but it takes 7 days to unanchor so you need to set your own alarm with a reminder. Easiest way is to prep a bookmark 300km away and be aligned and at 70% of your speed when it unanchors, you can warp right too it and scoop it on the spot instead of slow boating to it. It'll be ~50km from the undock point and bookmarks of where the structure was (something weird to do with the signature radius and how it's calculated) 
---
Do not sit at docking point waiting, easy way to lose the structure.
---
Have a alt with warp scramblers hugging the structure ( not just on approach but manually piloted to the closest point to the middle, this will be your fly catcher for if anyone tries to steal it.
---
It's you.
---
I don't know that's what all the krabsec people were whining about.
---
Because people have been really taking the piss as of late.
---
There is something called communism...
---
It's been three hours and no bittervet has complained yet about how this newb pandering is literally the end of EVE. Must be a new record.
---
 Glad you did, it's great.
---
Sweet (I am a fan of the channel), can I also assume that the Eckhearts Ladder team is going to be looking into the lore and stories from New Eden in the near future?  
---
If so, let us know if you guys plan on putting an EvE Online channel on your discord.  I am totally onboard for EvE online content on the channel.
---
"[I'm gonna write me a new minivan this afternoon!](https://dilbert.com/strip/1995-11-13)"
---
u/ccp_peligro can you guys do a fun little experiment?
---
Since you guys are obviously skilled in finding bots, why not report those bots to their Alliance leadership (lets use GSF as an example) and have them kick said bots from alliance and set to -10? This would then break the bots as they have nowhere to dock/tether, which means free purging kills for us :)
---
I'm sure if we had bots in Goonswarm, we'd have a field day purging the now -10 bots in our own space.
---
Then you can happily ban them!
---
And if an alliance refuses to comply or simply neglects to, well, I'll leave that up to you.
---
Asset safety was designed to fix the problem of your items being stuck in a hostile player-owned outpost, after coming back to the game.
---
That problem only ever existed in sovnull. Therefore asset safety should have always been a mechanic tied to sovereignty.
---
Here are my proposed changes to the current system:
---
A structure has no asset safety by default. If your alliance owns the sovereignty in the system, you can install and activate an asset safety service module in any of its structures. Once asset safety is activated, it cannot be deactivated, even if sovereignty is lost. Only one structure per system may have asset safety activated. Structures can now be upgraded in-place to their larger counterparts. 
---
- A structure anchored in hostile space, would have no asset safety.
---
- Any structure anchored in highsec, lowsec, or npc null could never gain asset safety.
---
- Less incentive to spam structures. Outside of sovnull, no asset safety will limit their use to industry and provide more incentive to blow them up = people will live in stations again, like they're supposed to. 
---
- More incentive to flip sov and blow shit up.
---
There, I fixed citadels for you, CCP.
---
Speaking clearly is important and picking a bad target is better than picking no target.
---
Am I the only one hoping she said James instead of The Mittani?
---
Well now I want to see him huff and puff
---
Anything with a name that isn't a meme or anyone flying a VNI must be a BOT! BURN THEM ALL!
---

700km seems reasonable, gotta get those drones off the Rorquals and then get back for the salt
---
I have, actually, done exactly this for the past 2 days while hunting these bits and experimenting with catch and drag bubbles.

Took about 5 seconds per bot to report and like 6 clicks per.

Korean company cracks down on Korean cheaters is kind of a story though.

You are not supposed to look behind the curtain.
---
There is obviously a narrative being pushed here, seemingly by at-risk parties.
---
It's not that hard tbh, esp. if you are blue to the bot.
---
Methinks doth protests too much.
---
Still gotta investigate you for holding your pants up
---
What you really want to do is make the space the botters are using less valuable.  Increase security status, or impose a tax on it.  Or introduce no-bounty diamond NPCs with rabies.  Give the owner a reason to crack down themselves.
---
No.. It's pretty common.

You're not trying to pass time sensitive intel in text are you?

1. This is the yearly bans to data, we have no data from other years to see if this is an increase, decrease, or on par for what we would expect.
---
2. "Mostly all" in COINS and PBLRD. Where are all the other spikes in bans coming from?
---
3. With that in mind, we can't make any connections right off of the bat. Anything otherwise is massive tinfoil hattery.
---
&gt; nobody in their right mind would pay ccp to police their game for them, for free
---
Do you even play Eve?
---
That wouldn't work. PH (or any alliance really) could be destroyed within the month.... Put obvious botting alts in and run them 23/7. Get banned, rinse and repeat
---
Set your med clone at Jita 4-4 Calnavy Assy, set desto to Tama, fly t1 kite frigates, die to everything until you figure out how to stop dying. Enjoy being actually pretty decent!
---
Definitely agree that the security team should be expanded. Just having a person or two with the time to spend searching for unusual wallet trends among other things would probably help massively.
---
&gt; sometimes found the toon/corp in question didn't provide proper ESI access
---
So why are they ratting in your space at all? like, what kind of show are you running?
---
Looks legit. I'd play it.
---
That is a *fairly* recent change
---
I use caps lock instead of F1.
---
It is said that the old Macros die hardest my friend
---
Why join a group?
---
Instead, pick a target. You're looking for a character that's out ratting (or mining - but you can't solo hunt Rorquals) 23/7. Ideally, you're looking for a corp or constellation full of them so that it'll be harder for the owners to move them away from you. Learn about their programming. Take notes on what they do in response to certain actions of yours. (It may also help to read reports from others who have posted here describing how they caught bots, but understand that not all of those are actually reports of bot catching and some deliberately leave out a critical element or two so they can keep using them to catch bots.) Once you know how a bot works, more or less, look for weaknesses you can exploit. Farm away until the owner changes or shuts them down.
---
If you're confident they are bots, and you're not just catching humans who love to rat, share your notes with CCP so maybe the bot owners can get wrecked too.
---
just get better with your cloaky warp ins..don't fix what isn't broken

---
&gt;I feel like I could run a bot and never be caught on my main and regularly used alts using this methodology.
---
Try it.
---
But yes, I think we all expect they're going for the low and medium hanging fruit, and not the very high risk, low reward accounts you're suggesting.  First, those don't warp the economy nearly as much. Second, the evidence is harder to obtain. Third, even if they do catch these more rarely, the bans hit harder and are more effective when they do hit.

December 15, 2015. Opening salvos of WWB, when the Goon Viceroy program and their associated invasion of low-sec were starting up.
---
I had been happily living in low-sec/NPC null-sec for more than four years by that time, having completely rejected sov life in 2011. But the Viceroy program and the invasion made me wonder if EVE life was soon going to be sov life and I might be just done with EVE. It seemed ridiculously unlikely that the leadership of the low-sec groups would be able to put their petty differences aside and deal with this threat. It seemed likely that each low-sec group would be gobbled up piecemeal, defeated in detail.
---
I was in Snuff Box at the time, and we undocked one evening in Machs for an unnamed objective. We're sitting around waiting for the op to start when the FC announces that the ships that are about to land on us are friendly, not to shoot, and to wait for primaries. And then a big Shadow Cartel Mach fleet plus their allies lands on us, and we all collectively warp to a Goon staging POS in what I gleefully posted that night to Reddit was a low-sec murderball.
---
http://jestertrek.com/eve/2015.12.15.02.58.17.png
---
Goons took a few days to get the message, but their invasion of low-sec ended right then. Low-sec Voltron had formed.
---
It took a couple more years for sov life to become EVE life, but for that night and that moment, I was happy. That's my favorite battle memory of EVE.
---
Bullshit.
---
Well me and a few people who do it are pretty much in CCPs hands. The vocal majority of krabs wouldn't give a flying fuck if a beautiful emergent playstyle died since it's their drones on the line.
---
Fact

&gt;which is what appears happens to a lot of people
---
Citation needed.
---
Too loud, I'll wake up the dust bunnies in my case and stick with the V key
---
I love this kind of pvp, I've taken to bumping orcas away from their drones till they log off or warp off in order to steal them as I don't have command destroyers trained
---
I believe botters were seeding VNI pilots into various low entry corps to spread out their bots instead of keeping them in a single renter corp or whatever. I can see what you said though, with the right person just takes a few extra or missing chromosomes
---
Much like EVE News 24, you're like two months late.
---
Open the country.
---
Stop having it be closed.
---
See?  
---
All these fancy lads in their fancy ships and yet your Incursus gets the most screen time.
---
It's not any farther of a stretch than what doom did to Pelligro.  Seems fair.
---
Somewhere in the hierarchy of the Imperium, somebody is making a lot of isk from the rental program.  It's their job to either make it worth your while to do the admin required, or find somebody else.
---
Just to be clear:  renting space is not a CCP game function, it's something that was totally created by player organizations.  We can wish CCP was more proactive on the bots, but in the meantime it will continue to reflect negatively on the organizations that rent to them.  If they don't want to lose the rental isk when the botters are swept away, then somebody has to do the admin to at least make a faith effort to keep them out.
---
I chose them as an example because of their lax recruiting policy. I have neither the time now technical knowledge to do something like that, but I guarantee there are those who do. It seems like something easily exploitable
---
I pressed V out of habit and I got 2 ships on Dscan.
---
Inside my mind.
---
So anything you say is obviously right and only gets downvoted because you're poor, abused Doomchinchila.
---
Got it, I guess?
---
I was worried that having a +25% range bonus *without* activating Bastion would be a problem, but I forgot that Golems have a +50% Cruise/Torp range bonus that's basically baked into the hull.

So, James 315 is the god of hisec, The Mittani is the god of nullsec, and Bob is the god of J space.

I was there that day and quite probably in that fleet. I remember the fight at J-GAMP gate, we ended up in a ball of fire. Then we formed a fleet of hurricanes and went again to M-O... then moneybadgers won the fight for the last node, we docked up in the station knowing we lost just a fight... and then CO2 announced that they're resetting us, and I knew we lost the war.
---
Damn awesome moments. This and everything that followed, even if we lost it was still great.
---
No, I could be a bot, but making bots that make other bots is a bit outside my pay grade.

oh look the crab rave, how original, I'm sure no one had that idea ever

How is your eve playing experience, as a deaf person?

"Thunder Fighter uses the great space as the background, highly integrated hard science fiction elements, to show the game player an extremely free virtual universe sandbox world.  Players can experience the real combat and enjoy the perception when they are driving the spacecraft freely shuttle in the game universe and battle virtual sense."

why don't you tell us about KWG then? how many bots are you harboring there? they sure weren't enough to buy stacks of eagles that you could welp

Killed his friend next door, 0 resistance.

Pretty safe to say it's a bad bot.
---
Eve has sound??!?
---
What corps are there like that?
---
Still bullshit. If he runs a rental program and accept bots because he is to lazy to keep the bots out of his income he simply should stop it or pay the price.

The amount of people who don't warp away from no scram wowza
---
Eviction defence fleet - there's nothing like the release of tension when you realise you and your friends have done enough and you won't be losing your home.
---
Have you considered doubling the isk removed when you ban a bot? IE bot earns 1b but you remove 2b from the alliance?
---
You are all retarded if you think this is a great thing they have done. It is just PR because they are too incompetent to actually solution this long term. 
---
Every few months they pipe up with "we banned xyz number of bots" and you all play along like dumb cunts...
---
This is goddamn beautiful.
---
Wingspan does not count as wormhole, you spend your time in ns hunting not doing real wh stuff
---
Making Eve as easy as it is I think has stagnanted content. The players in the game have sorta gotten better over time while Eve is getting easier. Limitations and challenges is the reason why players play Eve. Having to theorycraft and find solutions to problems is what makes this game fun.
---
I believe you are thinking of bombers bar.

Looks like it's coded to the actual 'object', not the default location of same.

Did this guy die? Should this be NSFL?

"it isn't our responsibility to do ccps job"

Yea it isn't but at the same time I bet if your corp wallets suddenly lost a hefty bit of weight and you know where that income came from and why you'd come on here and bitch and scream about it.
---
Good get fuckin yeeted.

As a bomber bar fc I spend most of my time scanning and rolling, much more than wingspan does
---
Nah man, that's where my drone controls go.
---
The mention of undocking scared them all away
---
Wholeheartedly supported. Good luck, Stitch!
---
But, if you have a strong feeling that a player you run across might be a bot and you don't report it then nothing happens at all. CCP isn't perfect and it's going to take a lot of people working together to start to fix the problem. Why continue to be divisive on this? 
---
I'm not saying that you should fly around reporting every person you think could possibly be a bot, but if you know what botting behavior looks like and you think someone is a bot REPORT THEM. Also CCP better realize with more people reporting they will have to find a better way to filter through reports and discard false positives.
---
I bound mine to middle mouse button, just think it's quicker to spam that way.

---
If someone is playing for 23 hours a day consistently for weeks on end, then they just might be a bot.
---
&gt; Yeah I know that, but speed when positioning on the battlefield does not equal agility. An mjd does not help you get under cap guns and does not help with damage mitigation, which afaik is a big factor of why leshaks are used to murder caps.
---
what are you smoking? leshaks are used to murder caps cause they have amazing dps, not because they're agile. A mjd can literally put you under cap guns, not that it will help a lot cause an unsupported cap dread won't do much and unless you can straight up tank it a haw dread is best just kept away, you can be under the gun as you want and it won't make a difference cause there's this thing called webs.
---
As a goon I fully support this, remove all botters. Now...also remove market bots..thanks
---
I'm sure it still keeps some kind of stats.
---
Obvious Halloween costume
---
Drake army was fun for me back in stainwagon just before the fail cascade.
---
&gt; That depends how much of the information needed to put in that effort is available to a bot.
---
If it is in the client, it is available to the bot.
---
Like a real hammering, or the usual polite request that they stop and shake a finger at them?
---
you should look at feythabolis too, to be very honest with you, you won't have enough employees to ban all of those

Isn't TEST taking money from and actively defending KWG right now?
---
Imagine being this triggered.
---
Krabsec? Your need to feel superior to others too compensate for reality is showing. Careful.
---
Whatever.
---
Let me know if you find any bots in TEST, I take great delight in killing, kicking, and then reporting them on the rare occasions we do find one. Just pop a message on discord at Cornak#0148 or here on Reddit with the info on the bot.
---
Ha Ha Ha silly pilot!
---
I didn't believe we had as many bots as pla did until today.  Maybe it's a tip of an iceberg, the plex price recently really scares me a lot.
---
Who knows what world CCP wakes up in every other day.
---
Oh god, they would bring reinforcements... titans dashed, supers lost, a massacre... i like it :D
---
With 320dps incoming it can be hard to realize that you aren´t pointed in time
---
You are welcome, I hope they died glorious deaths.
---
Bruh it’s been almost a year now since I left w space and became a brave zergling, and I still spam “v” whenever I play.
---
Fuck the blocs that establish them.
---
It is incredibly easy as a Corp leader to see who is botting. Simply try to have a conversation with the people ratting once in a while. Looking at the Corp wallet to see where your tax income is coming from sheds light as well. If you're seeing someone generating tax income 23/7 and yet never responds in-game or out of game, guess what, chances are he's a botter.
---
Report the man and then let CCP make the final decision, if he's not a botter, nothing will happen and no one gets hurt.
---
Yeah, the Icavians are the real threat.
---
I moved from Null to Worm but I haven't played in months

[deleted]
---
The difference between those groups and KWG, is KWG is literally an alliance for botters. The difference between all those groups and you is you're the only one that should be banned from posting.
---
A compelling candidate!
---
I just have one question - what makes the VNI the "golden goose"? it seems to sell terribly, at 500 isk/lp when made from the BPC?
---
Take my upvote ya filthy animal!
---
I mean, if you're already botting, it's not much of a stretch to write a bot that will create/utilize emails to register alpha accounts (can't remember if CCP does account creation captchas but you can outsource those to a [human] farm specialized in it), log into those accounts every day and set a VNI queue and once that's done apply to any given alliance and bot. Admittedly at some point the bot would require to be given a VNI or several, but you can automate that away with a VNI-delivering bot too.
---
Ultimately the horizontal scaling of VNI bots is limited only by  the craftiness of your code monkey in avoiding both (hostile) players and CCP.
---
Vat ve vuck arv yov talving abouv?
---
sniffing your own farts I see! Of course members think their group is great, it's called blind loyalty.
---
    
---
Issue is, your group, my group, every other group, harbours, willingly or otherwise, people that disregard the rules we all agreed to uphold. I know GSF isn't squeeky clean here but we do take actions, least at a corp level, to remove anyone that is breaking the rules. The risk to our corps are just too great (neg walleting a corp FUCKS them, it's not smart to leave yourself open to that). Brave corps do the same, TEST corps, NC and PL. Not so sure about Frat as cheating seems to be endemic in their culture, sadly, but that all works out in the wash.
---
Now the interesting thing to see is what reactions happen and the fallout
---
To be fair, twitter is pure shit and many people won't touch it until they feel they have to.
---
More like OvO
---
I got away with a bank robbery by not having a dollar sign on my bag.
---
Because being forced to participate in that coalition's ops and supporting a group you have no interest in, when Eve is a video game that costs money to play and its intent is to let players do whatever they want, is despicable?
---
It's not different for renting, you pay isk to a coalition you have no interest in supporting. Renters don't get asked to fight, so they can use it for krabbing on alts.
---
What? Like trust them with their handling of Brisk?
---
but my mouse wrist suffers from many years of gaming ( and bad positioning probably and also 1 or 2 breaks), so i cant spam too much or else it gets tired and from unconfortable can get to hurt :(
---
This may be a problematic suggestion, but why not just disallow connections from known vpns? I know some people will cry and moan about security, but meh.
---
There's the fact that TEST are shit and there's the fact that like most major alliances there are bots. They also gave Tenerifis to XIX (who as we all know have NO BOTTING REPUTATION *AT ALL*) and supposedly have PIBC TQ edition (who *DEFINITELY WILL NOT BOT*) moving into omist where people are known for how they DO NOT BOT
---
Its not gonna work, they don't even have undock buttons to highlight.
---
I see the goon flair is merely ironic
---
In case this is sincere, you basically have to be a goon to interpret it with that much charity.  The implication was pretty clear, especially when every other alliance was either telling their members they were strictly anti-botting or at best completely silent or apathetic.
---
He didn't just say "you can't be sure". He also explicitly said that anyone helping CCP in their mission to find botters was "blue fucking".
---
Is the risk of false positives worth just not even trying?  Because that's what he was advocating.  He wasn't arguing in good faith. He was being a lawyer to try to argue the side that had the most immediate, short-term benefit for him at the detriment of the wider economy.
---
That was so much fun :-)
---
Deserves dubbing over with some nice voice acting.
---
Expanding their team is the best thing, more transparency is needed (we want and i think like to know who, what the boters did , alpha or omega and other tasty things) and perhaps if CCP would learn how not to push shit up the throats of 99% ( i dont know the number) of innocent players cause some horrible bad apples are trying to ruin OUR  game.
---
I am a goon.  The implication was don't generate PvE drama.  That's a constant in Goonswarm.  If you were in Goons you'd understand it.  PvE drama gets you commissared, mostly because it annoys directors.  So most goons would interpret what Mittani said as part of that.
---
Do you understand how racist that just was?
---
My thought it's because the symbol of [raised fist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raised_fist) historically has a couple of close related meanings like strength, unity, support, all that stuff, you know. That's basically what you usually expect to come from a friendly cyno.
---
1. Video is sidesplittingly good :-)

2. I miss Aura’s original voice so much

bwahaha
---
&gt; This has to be a continous effort, as the average VNI Bot is recreated with a few injectors and clicks .

Why use injectors when you can train multiple alphas at the same time
---
I think I had that teacher.
---
Damn.  He must be immortal.
---
It has a soundbite for wh fires, that's it
---
Give it time. If what you say is true I am optimistic. Shake up the galaxy a bit for us, will you? :)
---
How do they stack up against SUAD though?
---
&gt; edit: when it comes to botting/rmt. strictly botting/rmt.
---
so CCP is extremely accurate when banning bots, but not when banning for other things
---
and yet they are so bad at banning bots that this sub is regularly up in arms about the bot plague
---
thunking

---
&gt; While the wallet is negative, the corporation cannot invite new players.
---

---

---
Join alliance again
---
Yeah, but just as easily countered. If it's obvious there's a concerted effort to do this to a large and prominent alliance then CCP could pretty easily just waive the fines or reduce them.
---
How do you delete somebody else post
---
Hardly, just pointing out how retarded actual Eve community is these days... How things have changed over the years.
---
Isn't that literally the reason we have RICO?
---
Freeze the corp from leaving alliance as well
---
What I said was general thing tho, not specifically aimed at the botting part.. We’re all about having a great time and keeping it classy, even though I’ve got one guy in mind that constantly salty but I guess he’s born that way lol..
---
&gt;Of course members think their group is great, it's called blind loyalty.  
---
&gt;I know GSF isn't squeeky clean here but we do take actions, least at a corp level, to remove anyone that is breaking the rules.
---
I mean, you're right about that first part at least.
---
Let the corp with an holding char and join a new corp done.
---
This is one of those ideas that sounds nice but doesn't work in practice. The problem is that you really have no way of enforcing this. An alliance leader doesn't have the time to patrol every system 24/7 and even if he did you can't ever be 100% sure someone is a bot. Neither can CCP prove an alliance has knowledge of renters botting. Making third parties responsible for the actions of rule breakers is just absurd, and is lazy on CCP's part. It's their job to enforce their rules, not other players'. 
---
Obviously, alliance leadership shouldn't turn a blind eye to suspected bots, and should definitely use them as target practice before throwing them out, but if CCP thinks it's a good idea to penalize players or alliances for the illegal actions of other players, they are idiots. Did you guys learn nothing from the Brisc Rubal train wreck?
---
IMHO CCP should offer some incentive for reporting someone who is later banned. If not a handful of PLEX, ISK, an extractor, etc. then at least an account-bound untradeable exclusive SKIN or something. That'd give people the incentive of making sure other people know of their good deeds.
---
I think I've seen some of your YouTube videos, a series where an Imperial Star Destroyer gets flung into New Eden by a black hole I think?

Zyklon B can be used as a pesticide to keep your crops free of bugs.

Are you suggesting because you can use Zyklon B to kill bugs, that it is safe to assume no one would ever use it to kill jews?
---
Brisc. And yes. I don't know what was more bullshit: The way CCP handled it or the way everyone on r/Eve jumped on two bandwagons in as many weeks. Everyone drank the kool-aid hard enough to turn Jim Jones lime green with envy.

Those were great days indeed :)

You're 100% right. CCP Peligro is not thinking this through, and should probably take a few hours to sober up before making an even worse PR nightmare than he already has. CCP just never learns. Yes, go ahead and start punishing innocent players for the crimes of other players, based on vague, impossible to prove assumptions that they know and are policing the actions of other players. That way you'll have more time to work on more shitty recycled events and new skins.

who are you

Of course, easier ways to kill millions of civilians than becoming a dictator and rounding up various ethnic groups to exterminate.
---
Also some NICs can have their MAC addresses changed, with relative ease.

Real pros macro it to every key! Muwahahahahah

Its better to compare navy to pirate progression. Since it goes T1 -&gt; Navy -&gt; Pirate. T1 isnt the comparison point to pirate.
---
Take a look at navy/pirate frigs and cruisers. In most cases going from a navy frigate/cruiser to pirate frigate/cruiser is a x2 cost increase (sometimes x3 depending on LP). 
---
So lets say navy battleships after balance changes settle around 300-350m. A good spot for pirate would be 600-700m on average.

Yep

I just sat back and watched the train wreck occur, then CCP try to re-assemble said train. It was amusing and very sad. I hope they learnt a very valuable lesson from their fuck up. At least it was public so they are going to be much more cautious in the future, it just sucks it damaged an innocent mans reputation where his job relies on said reputation

&gt;You say that cheating isn't endemic in China?
---
I'm not saying that. What I *am* saying, though, is that the public face of your alliance, The Mittanni, has been caught all but encouraging botting in the past, which makes me somewhat doubt GSF's commitment to being part of the solution.
---
If you are committed to it then good on you, but it's going to take a while for me to start believing it.
---
The goal isn't just the bots. That's an endless game of whack a mole you follow the money laundering back to whoever receives the ill gotten gains from the botting or you've wasted time and given botters no more than a speed bump.
---
Make those corps first hit by the Triglavaians
---
How many are gone?
---
nope didn't say that either
---
China no bot

TAPI hacked CCP twitter

NWO classification: Top Secret.
