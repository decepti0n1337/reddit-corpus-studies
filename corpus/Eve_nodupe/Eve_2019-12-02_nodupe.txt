There were Supercarriers and Carriers involved in the "killing the Dreads" part of the equation.

This.

An additional perspective is looking at booshing post-nerf.  A random group of 25 ships doesn't make a lot of sense on grid.  It was not like CCP provided a way to link ships to a specific boosher except if multiple boosher groups were at least 12km apart.
---

---
Mar5hy mentioned a mass-based approach in an above comment (a good idea).  Perhaps having some sort of list like an ACL could help large groups to coordinate and setup squads and wings (which is obviously complicated enough to question the need for the nerf in the first place).
---
It was just such an arbitrary decision to choose 25 random ships.  A nerf to the very enjoyable playstyle could've had a bit more logic to it (eg  mass) or increased the cost to the hunting side (eg fuel) without killing the playstyle  #ccplox
---
true, sucks when content creators are constantly hamstrung by worthless individuals tbh
---
Titans.
---
That doesn't save your idea. The fundamental premise is completely retarded, no amount of adjusting will fix that.

If there is only one buy order for the item run away.
---
Go back to where you got the item and wait for the scammer to sell another one then put the one you have up for just less than him.
---
Like... A real business? With physical wares? And external suppliers you gotta pay? And shipping? Cmon... CCP doesnt even manage to get a proper store for shirts run at halfway reasonable pricings...

So it even got worse over the year I m out of that show now? Wonder how that boat keeps floating still...
---
&gt;For me, injectors are not really a problem, but they highlight and speed up to reach the plateau of developments (endgame) and it shows the balancing issues of this "endgame" a lot faster and clearer than it would without.
---
Because they allow for everything to be injected. They were supposed to help new players catch up, but they do a lot more than that. They are also paywalled in that CCP must receive money for them to be available.
---
&gt;New paid features? I rather have them free, but I understand they want to make money... 
---
We are already paying for it. Why should we pay twice?
---
&gt;It does almost nothing? We lack a decent market for very high value items currently. 
---
So if I only pay for a sub, I shouldn't have access to this?
---
&gt; my understanding of Economics is ~~college~~ kindergarten level

In FWA the botter has a citadel and rats there. FWA is FXR owned space. Do you know if FXR is aware of this?

If you're worried about getting defanged while roaming you can bring extra drones and move them into your drone bay with a mobile depot (if you can spare the cargo).
---
Engaging t3s is no problem. Engaging several risk adverse cloaky sniper fit t3c on a gate is the issue. :D
---
But at the same time, tishu sometimes is the only content we get some late nights in the r10 area so aside of the ocasional idiot gloating in local about killing a T1 frig with 7 T3Cs , they pretty chill.
---
i wonder what could counter that!
---
Unlike the other guy I don’t think you were ever a douche. You lived in the edge of the rules and eventually ran foul one too many times. Those of us who flew with you had full respect for you. 
---
A few weeks back I mentioned that I suspected there was a dread cache in Fountain. I guess they felt they could deal with it. I suspected it was linked to panfam’s strategy but i wondered why so many neutral alliances would also be moving into YZ-. Now I know why...
---
You were detected early on. In hindsight I should of chased this down harder. Lesson learned.
---
Yea I would personally scout with my rorqs most the times. Or actually checked who the cyno pilots were.

&gt; R64s are basically a requirement to grow a corp living in NPC Null.
---
This is the dumbest thing I've read in a while, especially when talking about a &lt;30 real people corp. With 11 people, individual income matters a ton more and NPC Null is fantastic for that.
---
&gt; Then maybe as a CSM member you should be looking to promote proper balance around infinite isk generation and the things that made empires stronger

Already on it

I'm unable to launch it. I had no issues a few months ago playing.
---
You are the one who chose to join goons, can't say I feel the slightest bit bad for you.
---
Too bad the next biggest entity is bluetral with them, and doesn't have the balls to join in on this kind of dicking.
---
I said accessible, not fun. The isk methods in NPC null are basically L4 missions or moon mining or exploration. 2 of the 3 are accessible for new players.
---
I mean, EVE does have a block feature.  I have a whole alliance blocked.  That's how I would handle the "Deal with it " mentality.  Life goes on. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But the great thing in EVE is you can do whatever you want to your heart's content.
---
ngl I'm impressed that the fleet even let someone other than the FC light it, like I'm 90% sure if we were to pull a locus fleet down in PS the cyno for our blob would be the FC's alt
---
wait, you weren't impressed with black friday being the same 15% off as every other sale?
---
Please also make availability: To me so you don't have to check every filter.

We're already dunking PanFam most nights. It's just we don't spam reddit with our hot pve capital ships kill list.

Loki or Legion.
---
Loki works better for fleet stuff, but if you're ganking explorers, it makes little difference and Legion looks better.
---
when you kick an FC for using a fort to attack your enemies and your enemies get your diplos to kick the FC rather than kill the fort.....yeah, people are going to troll the fuck out of you for being a paper pushing krab alliance.
---
The best ships for pvp'ing explorers is a stealth bomber fit with rockets, or a split of rockets and blasters. 
---
You'll find that the primary challenge when hunting explorers isn't the fight, it's catching them. Stealth bombers have zero targeting delay after decloaking which means you will catch way more targets than in any other ship class. I find the manticore and nemesis to be most effective since they have 4 mid slots and can fit x2 scrams to stop warp stabbed explorers from getting away. If you have money, make one of the scrams on your ship faction with 3 points of scram for a total of 5, greater than the number of low slots on an astero, by far the most popular exploration ship in the game.
---
Aren't they like a week of training, if you got the prerequisites?
---
Imagine unironically pushing the "already replaced, didn't want those supers anyway" in the current year.  Like, if you lose 56 of 59 condors, you got dunked and there's no reason to argue it's not an L.
---
It isn't magically \*all good\* because those condors aren't condors and they're actually a huge strategic asset of your sov-holding entity, and I didn't even mention the fact that obviously there's a problem on the inside if this happened.
---
&gt; Did CCP announce or hint at developing more of these for the next year besides the Trig dread ship? 
---
They hinted at an angel capital a while back, never happened
---
&gt; Is there any desire for them to stock these in Blood Raider, Sansha or Guristas LP stores? I know Serpentis have them in theirs. 
---
Serpentis capitals also require a lot more minerals + faction specific parts, whereas BR sansha and guristas don't.
---
&gt; What are the typical market prices for these faction capital bpc's roughly? 
---
40-50b for the dread/fax usually (other than serpentis), 300-400 for the titan (other than the serpentis)
---
&gt; Ditto for finished ships? Is it worth just making them yourself instead? 
---
Considering the mineral costs aren't that high compared to the BPC, they're about the same price
---
&gt; Besides being trophy ships, what are each of these actually good for? Pve? Pvp? 
---
People use them in wormholes for shenanigans
---
I've seen that video
---
It would also be another step in dumbing down the game. How about people just learn to manually fly their ships instead.
---
Maybe it's because it's beta. Maybe it's because this a game on a mainstream platform.
---
I've suddenly got an idea for a new line of 'gummie' candies!
---
Oh, and /r/eveporn
---
Why is someone laughing at something belittling it? Joy doesn't requires laughter.
---
What's so special about sov? You only need it if you plan on making capital ships, especially needed for super carriers/titans. Put down your citadels in NPC nullsec or join something like Querious Fight Club (Goons protect your sov, you get to pvp).  
---
Syndicate or Stain are some good places to try out. Or try Solitude highsec and do journey's into lowsec/nullsec until you're comfy doing it, then move.
---
It's a sandwich.
---
&gt;level 3Pittsburgh2989Blood Raiders60 points · 9 hours ago I got purged from Goonswarm after 6.5 years flying / fc'ing with them (something like 20-25 fleets a month). All for dread bombing some neutrals from a Fortizar on a made up rule saying you couldn't use them to kill ratters/miners. 
---
TLDR is he got kicked from goons for some random FC diplo issue without any warming from higher ups. And now he is mad and killed 50+ goon rorqual.
---
If you don’t want to give api keys join horde lmfao
---
“Rich bittervet” just makes you sound like a twat
---
But that doesnt really matter If you use a character to just sell them off or have as mule
---
Sansha super costs about 100-120b, the building costs are about 10b. No, they're not going to be in LP stores anytime soon
---
Two characters, Testy McTest and Sarmaul, were very active on theory crafting Minmatar pvp fits on the official forums. (I think they are now referred to as the old forums). Testy made his own forums, scrapheap-challenge.com and went by the name Calmdown. The forum went on for a few years until Testy/Calmdown got hired by CCP. Shortly after that scrapheap-challenge.com was shut down. One of the posters Entrox had an archived snapshot and set up failheap-challenge.com.
---
Well, did you expect an elaborate game for mobile? Where keybindings isnt a thing? I mean, to me sounds like your wanting a mobile way to play Eve Online. Not Echoes.
---
If they made the same complexity of all the skills in the game. A phone game taking 15 years to max? Assuming they dont bring in skill injectors? Youre asking for a dead game. Mobil games can not ever be like PC games. Not when it is real world training time.
---
I will admit the scaling of training is weird.
---
So is the.. interesting method they have towards labeling ships and giving certain ships bonuses.
---
Also their manufacturing system is way to complex for a starter frigate. Where they introduced PI into it.
---
But, overall it doesnt seem too bad at the moment.
---
And Eve took complexity of skills out when they let scrubs by injectors after buffing the LP stores.
---
Obviously, [legacy code](http://i.imgur.com/Iqy3lny.png).
---
I am not talking about "being able to *use* a super", I am talking about "undock with it and die" which only requires the racial skill at lvl 1 :)
---
(Capital ships skill takes 2 weeks for a super carrier or 12 weeks for a titan, not factoring in implants/remaps)
---
It is also beta and as far as I can tell I have found 9 buttons where features are not online yet.
---
Give the market time to build. I bet they add that shit in with proper release.
---
The problem is that there is no punishment for not honouring the order and if there was, people would just avoid it with alts.
---
Lol. Sounds like I stopped playing at a good time. What the fuck has happened in 3 or 4 years
---
These will be obviously painted but they looked so yummy I couldn't help posting them 😅
---
Edit: btw these are roughly to scale, the Machariel is a huge boi.
---
Anything that makes rorqs easier to kill the better
---
What is your nick?
---
Just goes to show a well-placed fart sound is still high comedy well into adulthood.
---
Not a bad idea, you can freely scout nullsec from the inside the blob.
---
It's in the screenshot
---
The whole point of panic is to give the rorqual time to get help
---
Ofcourse they were - they don’t give a fuck about anyone underneath them.
---
Dont want to burst your bubble (hehe) but it would be rather simple to code an evasion manouver to escape 99% of sabre gatecamps.
---
First information gathered of the sabre and if any other ships on the gate.
---
Then with basic vector algebra find a good vector for the evasions:
---
* MWD
---
* Cloak
---
* Fly away from threats
---
* Immediately turn perpendicular 
---
* Fly cloaked for 1-2 min to ensure you are no longer in a bubble and warp away
---
I dont write bot but this is what I did to avoid gatecamp. Worked like a charm.
---
Bad decloakers just fly at you.
---
Good decloakers fly at where they see your initial vector.
---
When you cloak up and change direction its highly unlikely that they will find you.
---
Wait is that the tortoise industries that was in exitium?
---
Idk who you are but I love you! So much destruction is music in my ears. It's the PL clone genocide all over again. Leadership will never learn, now do they? You do not kick highly rewarded fc's over a tit for tat. The dreads that died that day in the name of content could easily have been mined back with those roqs in a day or 2 but now those need to be replaced too. 
---
Now I wonder if the mineral prices will go up.
---
Tbh I would prefer the skill just allows you to neg wallet by a certain amount instead of the order failing. Pretty silly to allow scam buy orders.
---
Now this is the content I sub to r/eve for
---
incroyable du cul
---
Capitals Ships is a 14x skill. At stock attributes, and +4 implants, it's twelve-ish days to get it to Level IV.  
---
But looking more closely at the pre-reqs; making Advanced Spaceship Command (a 4x skill) non-injectable would be a better option. Every ship that benefits from ASC also *requires* ASC to be fully trained. ASC unlocks the JF skill at Level IV. But it's pointless because Racial Freighters, Rorq, and Bowhead are unlocked at *Level V*. 
---
That's (under the above assumptions) a twenty-four day pause-button on making capital-sized mistakes. While I do hope that's enough time for young newbies to grow some sense... 
---
Let's just say that I've flown with some pilots older than my father that still have a lot of growing to do.
---
Maybe you should ask yourself if what was said makes any sense. If it doesn't, maybe it's fake?
---
Echos is an Apt name for it.  
---
Dev's shouted an idea into a pit of funding, and this was the hollow Echo back.
---
He called your alliance (or at least the alliance in your flair) a bunch of rotting krabs.
---
It's funny because rot implies Rote were ever healthy to begin with.
---
When you cllick set up buy order you have an advanced and simple version, in the advanced version there's some parameters you can set, the quantity order option is also visible when viewing via market aswell, so you can see if someone did it.
---
I think this guy must be a bot reporting other bots, that explains the random responses part I read about further up in the thread.
---
Sure, remove the skill of piloting from the ever-stagnating game, what could possibly go wrong. People should have less rewarding things to learn because you can't pilot your ship like how you see it on the youtube.
---
Crosbey is the best crybaby and best worst sportsmen.
---
Well, it is now.
---
Don't worry. English is My third language and it's not that easy. You are more than ok man. :)
---
I run traning fleets for corp mates and friends, and always we do it in English. The idea is not only they learn to fly un fleet, but that they can fly with any other FC or group.
---
It takes time. So don't worry. And in any case, a fleet Stand Down isnt anything serious and, if it's because the Game has a Lot of new players, that is something good for all Game community itself. ;)
---
For now, you can have a few guys that speak some English in comms and translate for newbros. Then WTM has FC traning programs too.
---
In anycase. Don't worry and enjoy.
---
What revenge? He was kicked because he feed 100+ dreads because he don't know how to make fleet jump and now he revenged? 
---
Be fair if FC in PL lost 100+ dreads he would be kicked and blacklisted
---
That's a single clause fallacy if I ever saw one.
---
Those statements are mutually exclusive. If you don't enjoy your gameplay in a corp/alliance as a linemember, the logical alternative is to change the corp/alliance in which you are a linemember.
---
It is accepted that setting up and leading a group is difficult, but that is hardly the responsibility or remit of the linemember individual. If anything, it's a further failing of the leadership structure - failing to make an environment where players enjoy their play.
---
And likely it is just an environment issue; there are obviously other players in that corp/alliance who enjoy being there, and enjoy living by those standards.
---
Oh Jesus I'm sorry I missed that.
---
Maybe pair the skill of margin trading with security status. Or standings You need to maintain above certain value to be able to use the skill. And failed trades will create standings loss. Fall below the threshold and all your buy ordered gets cancelled. This way legit traders can use the skill. Where as the scammer has to go the extra mile to maintain the standings. 
---
Peole should be allowed to scam. But not via a simple to abuse game mechanic. Scamming it self needs to be a complex gameplay.
---
alright, thanks! getting locked out of your account when switching phone sucks but reading those cases where character's sp get drained scared the shit out of me. I'll take the inconvenience over losing everything lol
---
well done mate
---
If your cruiser skills and the magic 14 aren't maaxed as much as they can be (assuming your alpha) then train those first and stick to destroyers like the algos, once you get your skills up a bit and have some experience then move onto thorax, if you've got as best as you can get for an alpha toon and are deadset on flying a cruiser the fit is fine however if you aren't flying in a gang with logi you will have to be careful on what you 1v1 given that most solo fits are selfrep

So if I understand this "scheme" correctly, the thing is that he has sell orders that when compared to HIS buy orders, looks like a profitable trade so that people are buying his sell orders (which he sells at a profit) with the false potential profit made by his false buy orders?

---
Thanks for the info, i did upgrade to omega very recently mainly to get the skills for this fit lol
---
I do have a fitted Algos that i was using during alpha but i thought this would be an upgrade
---
Well... Highsec politics... What can I say?
---
Join PH we have a few corp that are suitable. Biggest one is Blackwater USA (BUSA), they are mainly real life vets. Almost all of them have to many account haha, they will help you put that mountain of ISK to use.
---
Have a video of the drop they did two nights ago:
---
https://youtu.be/NTk7TB_k5Cc
---
Suprisingly really well done. You have to go into it understanding they shunted alot of the complexity into different avenues. So far I like it alot.
---
Phone? Pfft, multibox that shit on your desktop.
---
I think it's because it's beta
---
I can't spam local! FC, what do we do know?!?!
---
@CCP: but think of Jita scammers!
---
Wait Wait wait, when did she turn into a Rachel? Is this a recurring theme with corps? Lmfao
---
Nearly 1600 HS corp full of new players? Its then a sort of scam.
---
Tell us more about Rachel! More pls, its so golden!
---
It's almost like Pitts wasn't kicked for feeding..
---
Fuck Blobs, fuck Jspace if not a single one has atleast a little pre experience of you 11. I would literally go out there and settle somewhere if you guys are into that stuff. I mean, look at Geminate, the top left corner (which is a hella nice place) is literally inhabited by brainless space monkeys and taking their space would take no more than it would take to bash their structures out of there.
---
No, but glad you’re having fun and finding content I guess.

Oh no, he's trained Repost V!

Disgruntled ex-horde member #15031 killing PvE ships. Sad that your posting is just as bad as your leet PvP skills.
---
Nothing worth note. This was a most excellent drop thought. I thought I miscounted when I counted the commas on both sides of the kill report
---
What has EVE become? Too lazy to read and then complaining ...
---
Its as if 1500 bots cried out...but no one saw local
---
Highsec drama, best drama.
---
Damn, and I thought Brohemia were decent people. Sad to see em fly with someone like you
---
Adding this to my boomerpuke comment collection.
---
So if nothing of value was lost you presumably have plenty of FCs who are doing as much or more for PvP. Which are at least as enjoyable or getting greater numbers in fleet than Pitts did.

You're right, at least for empire building. The empire building aspect is what markets EVE most imo. If empire building is boring because the optimal strategies revolve around content denial unless you can 100% win, then the people who come for the fun empire building leave. The lack of empire building players will start to hurt the non empire builders who like to hunt them for dank frags or good fights.
---
You sound like a spy.
---
But the thrust from the engines still applies to the ship as a whole. So if you've got some thrusters off to one side and the rest in the middle you end up having to do strange things to make keep going in a straight line or turn in different directions.
---
Did you provide feedback of what is not working well to the devs?
---
Players: Goon's can't tackle.
---
Pittsburgh: Hold my dread.
---
asymmetrical is even worse in space than not.
---
Basically this, but also that the content-denial strategies are equally harmful to the PvP/hunting communities compared to simple "lack of targets" problems. If you play the game to have fun, and you don't consider mining until you grow old and die to be fun, then you're SOL.
---
`**Only** two fleets a week`
---
Yikes.
---
but you still need center of thrust going through the center of mass.
---
No ESI? No meaningful corp for you. Its as simple as that.
---
Correct me if I am wrong, but those line members were ok with the decision made by their leadership or at least they didn't disagree strong enough to stop being line members.
---
They did release some concept art few years back, but thats about it.
---
...dual prop cruiser with tackle for pve?
---
and no rep?
---
Because it isn't easy and if any intel got out that a dreadbomb was staged nearby we wouldn't have been able to pull it off. Plus the cyno was off grid to ensure they couldn't panic obviously so if they had simply sent in 1 person to check the cyno position first we would've had to dock the dreads back up lol
---
&gt;You know, the link you post actually shows me how well protected the protesters are. 
---
lmao nothing to add just lmao
---
&gt;No police dress up like that
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XfPSDg29iI
---
So some random dude (with gear and a batton) started walking with the official police and started randomly attacking protestors? Even though he is wearing the same [patch](http://prntscr.com/q521f3) as the 'official' [police](http://prntscr.com/q5222a)? If that's the case he is impersonating an officer INFRONT OF FUCKING OTHER OFFICERS and that should be something you should worry about WAY more than saying 'no police dress up like that'.
---
&gt;And one key fact is, HK PTUs are also local, they are NOT from mainland China.
---
It's more of a detail imo and not a key fact I couldn't give less of a shit where they're from just that they're savages that don't deserve the air they breathe. 
---
&gt;If you talk about bow and arrow, that only exists recently. The "frontline" protesters used road sign to hit a police's head. I witnessed that in August.
---
The bow and arrow was a joke as in the force the police is using is in no way shape or form proportional to that of the protestors. I`d rather get hit on the head with a sign than getting shot at.
---
&gt;Hope you can also see that.
---
Nobody is claiming that the protestors are taking all the punches without retaliation. 
---
&gt; It it hard to find which side first used violence
---
Meh that's just pointing fingers, it's about proportionality. The fact that the government has the sole right for violence is not something you should take lightly and must always be used proportionally. You don't roll in tanks when someone is throwing rocks. Actively using violence should be your last resort as a government official and not your first (which is in this case).
---
&gt;I watch news from BBC, CNN, Reuters and also Chinese medias like CGTV. But I never fully believe them
---
That's always a good thing but I can't see any news or factoids that can justify the level of aggression used by the government since , again, I believe that the level of aggression should be proportional.
---
Moment of inertia my little spaceship bro.
---
:parrot:
---
It's working, but players who logged in right after DT are still not visible in some cases nor can they see local, corp etc themselves.
---
What fun and immersive game-play.

No offense intended by this comment, the old moa model just makes me want to vomit.
---
&gt; generic space fighter #7
---
That's kinda been the Caldari thing, though. Not to this extreme, but their designs have always been closest to the "generic human spaceships" found everywhere in SciFi.
---
That's nuts
---
It’s both.
---
Now they are.  5 years ago that wasn't the case.
---
Don’t feel bad, you are hardly the first one to fall for it. I lost three billion to this scam about seven or eight years ago.
---
Where's the video?Impossible that nobody recorded this?
---
Which faction in EVE had ship designs closer to generic SciFi humans than Caldari five years ago?
---
But Stainguy will post you a link to a years old statistic (where most current botting powers haven't even joined the server yet) to prove that only FRT and off course PanFam are botting ....
---
Hahahah
---
As someone who always wanted to play Eve but didn't want to join because I was so late, this is awesome.
---
Show me where on the doll that the wormholers touched you.
---
I would alter the mechanic of the PANIC module so it gives an overshield instead of total invulnerability. The amount of HP of the overshield should be enough to withstand a smaller subcap fleet for several minutes but not a big fleet or caps.
---
Its buggy and I'm experiencing connection issues, but I'm surprised how well they have ported the interface and even added features to make it more mobile friendly. I actually came away from it wondering if CCP could learn something playing their own game. Which is kind of hilarious but says a lot about stagnant and slow CCP have been at evolving EVE for both newbros and long standing nullsec players.
---
Uhhh Mexican mittens confirmed?
---
Have you tried 1DQ1-A?
---
I'm not sure what you mean by this. Do you mean like someone walking you through how to make a production empire? Those dont exist.
---
But if you mean like t2 production or invention those are pretty easy to find just google eve t2 production guide. Research is relatively straightforward but I'm sure a guide exists somewhere for it.
---
Looks like a Raven.
---
Breaking symmetry only adds unnecessary complexity - and makes the design *incredibly* susceptible to failure.

lol props to the reaper pilot who saw their chance to whore and took it
---
I don't know what you mean by primary thrust vector and I'm not sure if that's true. Like I said, you can have one massive com in the shape of a sphere with a massive gun on it and you can increase the mechanical efficiency of turning it by placing a thrusts at a large distance from it. Then the thrusters can act in tandem to drive the craft forward or you can change the position of the primary thrusts to reduce or increase control sensitivity of the primary thrusts to make the maneuvering thrusts have a control margin or independence of the primary thruster.
---
There are trade offs and benefits of both designs. If you want to read about it detail, read some of the work by Peter Cork on UAV control principles and how positioning of the rotors on a quadcopter can have a huge effect on flight stability and ease of control. The same principles still apply in space just without drag.

Is it difficult to read le reddits while mounted on a cassowary?
---
In the days of the character bazaar, new players did not have access to accelerated character creation. Typically it was only veteran pilots who had the resources to buy entire specialized characters.
---
Injectors opened up this acceleration to be done in smaller batches. You don't need to afford the entire character, just a block of SP.
---
Pre-injectors, buying a super capital pilot was a common first step of getting into a supercap. Countless people trained them as a business, and there was no shortage of available pilots. If you removed injectors and went back to the character bazaar system, capital, rorqual, and super capital alts would still be readily available. These are all extremely popular roles and the characters easily sold.
---
This is why people complaining about injectors in the context of newbies injecting into supercapitals is so hilariously wrong. Buying your way into a rorqual, cap, or supercap is the sort of thing the character bazaar made possible for the a decade prior to injectors. What injectors changed is that they allow people to accelerate training in smaller bursts.
---
For ONE person yes, but there is a huge increase in supply now. Meaning that more people can buy that sp at a lower price point than before
---
This would probably work on in-gates, but the real problem is getting caught on the way out. Any good Sabre pilot won't burn his chance at your Astero on jump-in. He'll wait until you leave/come back before taking his shot.

You dont need a guide its all extremely straightforward. 
---
With blueprints you can:
---
\-use them to build
---
\-copy them, in order to build multiple parallel runs of the same thing or invent copies (turn tech 1 into tech 2)
---
\-research them - improve the bonuses that a BP original gives 
---
Manufacturing:
---
\-Tech one is built using minerals. 
---
\-Minerals are bought via ore. Ore is mined and then compressed so it can be transported. Minerals weigh a lot, so you dont want to buy and move them, but instead do that with ore which you reprocess close to where youre building. 
---
\-Tech two is built generally using tech 1 version of the product + some advanced products that require moon goo; this part is the most complicated because it works like an additional production line of tier 1, only instead of minerals you use moon goo. Unlike minerals, goo wights very little (while moon ore weighs a lot and cant be compressed) so you buy and move goo. 
---
Is there anything specific you want to ask?
---
So I downloaded Eve Echoes to take part in the open beta, but it crashes as soon as I open the game. It takes me to the Netease splashscreen and then quits to desktop, but leaves the app open in the background. Is there any potential fix for this?
---
This is a samsung galaxy s9, androud version 9.
---
How long this beta lasts?
---
I had to roll back most of my blocks a while ago.  I was missing out on too much salt :)
---
Can you elaborate on what you already know/ what you’re hoping to learn? There’s a lot of “tricks to the trade” but it really depends on that you’re trying to do and where you’re trying to do it. Are you doing Indy solo? For a Corp? T1 production or T2? Are you doing it in Null, low or high sec? Etc.
---
You’ll also find that there’s a lot of competition and small margins for most things so other industrialists aren’t huge fans of giving out info on how they do it, which may be why you’re not finding a lot of guides.
---
&gt;T2 Covops ships are shit compared to the astero 
---
Umm what? T2 Covert Ops are objectively better than the Astero for running Relic and Data sites. If you don't intend to PvP or to fight rats, T2 Covert Ops are better and more survivable than the Astero by a mile.
---
Doesn't look like it.
---
This is in game footage.
---
I suppose you of all people would know constant harassment when you see it. Interesting how quickly you saw this comment considering you don't play eve anymore.
---
Do you write in-game mails for this Demongateuk as well as doing voice-overs, because your writing style and views on female eve players (and women in general, judging from the passive-aggressive comments about the wife) are almost identical?
---
Oh the memories. Will it ever come back? VR? Give your Itteron a good rubbin.
---
You may be able to do t1 cloak not sure, you def can't fit cov ops cloak, if you can fit cloak, Google cloak warp trick, it'll explain how to align, click cloak, when cloak runs out instantly warp to location
---
Apply to Shadow Cartel, we are all filthy rich and don't care about your trade secrets.
---
No cloaks at all on Alpha.  Not prototype, not improved, not covert.
---
Holy shit, if this gets fully implemented  where there is only like 1 DT a week then the implications are huge.
---
[AUTZ rejoices]
---
If we got WH40K ships I'd resub in a heartbeat
---
[Doesn't look like it.](https://www.weblio.jp/content/%E3%81%AA%E3%81%8B%E3%81%8A%E3%82%8A) Either it means something in some other language or it's simply a bug.
---
The fundamental question is do you want the tank / survivability or the cargohold?
---
Each race has a "high cargo" industrial hull and a "high agility" industrial hull so your priority dictates your choice. Fundamentally survival relies on not getting pinned down. Without a cloak if somebody does manage to shoot you and has probes you're going to spend the next 15 mins warping around random rolling safes.
---
You're looking at a shield tanked ship since you want the low slots for expanded cargoholds. Unfortunately the low slots are also where the Inertial Stabilizers and the Warp Core Stabilizers sit. The tank is there to save you from stray shots or gate rats. It *might* buy you time to use ec-300s or a burst jammer if you are already aligned somewhere ready to warp off. It is unlikely to last long enough to let you burn back to a gate under fire.
---
Deep Space Transport is a Tech II industrial hull class, of which there are four: Occator (usually the best), Impel (the tankiest), Bustard (alright if you pimp it with C-type AIFs) and Mastodon (eh). 
---
You can't apply a Tech I industrial to a DST...if you need a Tech I industrial to haul a reasonable amount and have some semblence of a tank, your only choice is the Badger. 
---
    [Badger, Badger - Shield No Prop No Guns Full Cargo]

Hauls 16.5k m3 as an Alpha, with 27k ehp cold. Use your invulns when you're undocking and warping to the distant stargate, turn them off in warp to save capacitor. 
---
The other Tech I "cargo" industrials like the Iteron Mark V, Tayra, Mammoth and the Bestower can barely hit 10k EHP, you can get alpha'd by a Tornado. Use caution. Observe the gank limit.

I remember playing Lineage II by NC Soft in like 2006 and even back then, they already had one downtime per week (updates and stuff).

Hell, it's about time!

How so?

As I said bud, I know who you are. It was two years ago and this thread was posted to my discord when you typed that out. It was two years ago, I did stupid shit, i paid for it, all i do now is promote eve online and it's community. It was two years ago, move on
---
For real though. I'm so excited about this, even if it's just for one day to see what happens.
---
Imagine not having to log in cloaky campers once a day because there is not DT. The dream is REAL!
---
now now. you wouldn´t want to add a layer that keeps people from impulsivively participapating in the cashcow that are injectors.

he was a regular officer for awhile, then senior officer for literally days, and then yeah he went cooky. but was a good officer before all this shit went down. and yes we are indeed a newbro corp.

That was an epic dumpstering. I took part in that, what a dunk
---
I actually have no idea, probably because I'm an idiot.  Fixed it.
---
Also this guide rocks, just give in and join the club
---
Yeah, someone has been everywhere by now. Basically there are several types of instanced PVE sites that spawn scattered throughout each region (ie: data sites, relic sites, combat sites, wormholes, etc.) which you will need Core Scanner Probes to scan down before you can warp to them.
---
Data and Relic sites are what you'll want to find to make money. Relic sites have more valuable loot but also more competition, and the value and types of loot dropped by both sites varies based on region. They also require different skills (and the accompanying equipment/mod) to complete, namely hacking for data sites and archeology for relic sites.
---
This remindse when xix got totally dumpstered

I love the old Dominix model. Still loving it, still missing it. :(

At the very least that is some fast turnaround.

We had a good chat about this on TIS discord, Brisc and Dunk both like the idea of the raffle and we tried to explain why this will harm the game. We where told that they adults and we should allow adults to decide for themselves if they want to play the raffle casino game or not.
---
We asked how long this was in development and Dunk said NDA would not allow him to say. Brisc then said he was also under NDA so that means more than a year of design and development time.
---
All this BS sounds like my 12 and 10 year old daughters bickering in the back of my minivan on the way to Thanksgiving dinner... Except eventually with my girls,  I just turn on a Frozen on the DVD player and they STFU.
---
&gt; No more stealing augmented mining drones from hi-sec Orca at DT.
---
Have to move out to null and boosh excavators off rorqs.
---
Side thought to this would be remove the asteroid anomaly and current belts and make a combination system so belts are smaller but respawn in different area across the systems

Have you tried how broadcast works? Even in original eve.

---
I mean, I don't think anyone from HC of any big alliance cares about what people say on r/eve. Maybe someone from Test will come and announce things here, but that's mostly because Dreddit is/was Reddit focused.
---
HC doesn't care about shit people say, as long as it doesn't affects morale and fleet participation. And if it does, they'll spin and spin whatever they want in internal channels. Because that's what they do.
---
Split guns, whore on all targets, piss off FC. 
---

---
its the PH ego that we wounded.
---
I used it to set fire to a graphics card.
---
You didn't wound a thing...you're killing newbeans and running away from anyone with skill. Literally nobody in the game except you and your Brohemia friends think you've wounded anything. If you want to be seen as a competent FC you're going to need to form actual fleets and do actual demonstrable damage, first.
---
It's good that NC doesn't undock vs Goons. They are the only entity you aren't blue with, which means no huge battles for your line members in their titans. Eventually they will either become inactive, leave goons, or quit the game being faced with pure unopposed structure and sov grinds
---
I'm told this was trialed recently for a few days on the test server without too many issues but that's not the same thing as a live test on TQ. This is going to yield a lot of useful data, even if things get a bit weird towards the end.
---
I can't say right now if historically there's been longer tests.
---
I'll bring the marshmallows.
---
This is great.
---
But it sets a precedent that you can only undock anything larger than a jackdaw of inty if you are guaranteed an easy win.
---
  For a group that claims to be so powerful, you're petrified iof losses. Every time I've seen goons make an appearance- it's in jackdaws...
---
you didnt mention that the myrm died btw and we're isk positive.
---
So the gambling got you back huh?
---
What does CCP have against luggage, anyway?
---
sports
---
Tbh looking at these people i understand why someone said they miss GigX
---
Well, depending on your race, you have to choose shield or armor skills, weapon skill like hybrid vs missiles vs lasers vs projectiles. Light drone skill are always goo, especially on larger ships, necessary for most Gallente ships and the Aster/Strat.
---
You need guidance, I you want to get your pew on at this level, I recommend joining a faction warfare corp ASAP, you could also go with a newbro null corp, but I don't know what that's like at all.
---

Unfortunately, tone is difficult to read in text alone.
---
There are agents in stations that give you missions. You probably already ran into a few of these guys when you did the career missions. 
---
I would say that your best bet is likely combat (security) missions. Hauling and other mission types tend to not be as lucrative. This will let you slowly start making more ISK as you gain skills towards a ship that can run emerging conduits or level 4 missions. 
---
Your alternative is to try and run relic and data sites out in lowsec or nullsec. This is cheap to do, but avoiding death can require some solid in-game knowledge that new players often don't have yet.
---
Do some moon mining.
---
Yes. It's basic but it's also easier to set up and do. Just fly to ant system and choose planets there. The resource scanning is done automatically.
---
or better still steal all the stuff on it.
---
Bombs I would guess. Start bombing one hour before jump. Maybe arrange positions by TZ so DC capitals don't warp off
---
Eve Cybertruck
---
It’s gonna be chocked full of micro transactions I guarantee it
---
There's only a few actual choices here. Drones Turrets or Missiles for damage dealing? Armor or Shield for tanking?
---
The skills that apply to armor tanking a frigate are the same ones that apply to armor tanking a battleship, mostly the same for turreted frigates and turreted battleships all the support skills are the same.

It was 200 more people dude not the whole of our alliance. We brought one fleet.
---
On my phone here so pardon errors
---
1. I don't see the question here, but fly and do what you enjoy. Once you get a nice ship and style figured out, you might enjoy branching out and trying other ships and weapon types.
---
2. Generally speaking I don't think it's worth reallocating your skill points with extractors and injectors, but there's something to be said for setting long term (year+ long) skill training goals for yourself. Then remap your attributes to optimize that training plan. I know Evemon isn't being maintained anymore but it was a great tool for that. That may not be what you were asking though ...
---
3. I live in null, and my activities never take me even remotely close to that kind of income. Null solo is a hard row to hoe and will likely be challenging to turn into vast quantities of isk. In my experience anyway. Play the way you enjoy and only go to null if that's the gameplay you want. Not having a corp on your history is probably okay. Lots of people hang out in high sec doing their own thing.
---
4. Null requires a lot more thought and oversight in some ways, and less in others. If you leave yourself out somewhere you shouldn't be surprised if you return to your computer and you're back in the station in a new pod. Additionally most null corps will be at war constantly, making your attempts to run missions or do anything meaningful in high sec totally suicidal. To continue most L4 missions stay in NPC corps or join a high sec corp. Unreliability as you describe it would only impact you. If you're in a fleet with other people though ... That would be a problem.
---
5. Only make alpha alts with a specific purpose in mind. Also very worth considering making alts on your Omega account with an express purpose in mind as well. Like a T2 hauler alt for moving your valuable shit around for example.
---
6. Definitely find cheap ways to learn pvp. Ships with fits you can buy a dozen of and not blink an eye. If that's T1 frigates or destroyers, do that. If it's T3 cruisers ... Do that. Find ways to do what you want to do that you can afford and not stress about. Pvp and learning new things is stressful enough without losing half your net worth every time you learn something.
---
T3 cruisers are expensive but might be a good long term goal for exploration and pvp combined. But a much cheaper option would be setting up an Astero and hunting other explorers as you run sites yourself. Keep in mind though that you will inevitably lose any ship you fly. Fly what you can afford to lose.
---
Side note: herons have very little ability to defend themselves or attack other people. I don't think they'd be a good choice to learn pvp in. Cheap exploration ships for sure ... Pvp ships not so much. (In my opinion, and I am far from an expert)
---
Take all that for what you will. It's worth what you paid for it.
---
That would already be a 100% improvement! I hope for more but even that would be great for everyone.
