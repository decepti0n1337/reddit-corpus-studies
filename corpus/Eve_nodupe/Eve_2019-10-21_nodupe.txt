they better! :D
---
---
---
Soo, you were a spy?
---
If only server would work flawless. Since the fuckup with the deepsafe sites lask week I'm having terrible lag and desync just randomly every day.
---
Such a stupid analysis that Tuzy did.
---

---
Stop being such an average goon. You dont need to lick someone's else boots just because he is a top member in your alliance, this is just a game.
---
His whole analysis is just wrong.
---
Sabre.
---
This is a pretty nice dang video, gonna show it to my lil brother who’s just getting into the game.... gonna buy him the starter pack too so he can do this :)
---
(Maybe I’ll give him some iskies too)
---
This is Rediah. I'm amazed I'm remembered on here....the Sith are truly infamous! 😈
---
This is the EXACT reason I made this video! I had the most fun playing this game back in 2009 when I had 5mil SP and went straight to NBSI Null sec in providence.
---
Why would them waste their time?
---
Who cares about Linux?
---
and if only they fixed the intel issue @w@
---
I cant log on at all ;w;
---
Yeah I’m a 2010 pilot myself, the game was much different back then, and I’ll admit I was a filthy casual and took a few breaks which hindered my net worth and sp, but I’m still pretty well off, but this video will definitely help newer players get interested in the game!
---
The first thing I recommend is finding a good corp in an alliance that has all the citadels anchored and setup for production and a low tax rate. Anything 5% and below is preferred. I work out of 2 citadels that offers 2.5% for reactions and 3.0% for all other production from capitals down if you're blue. Working out of Low Sec just 6 jumps from Jita. We also have Null Sec sov for Supers, etc, though I haven't been down there yet.
---
There's money to be made in Low and Null, you just have to get in with the FCs and find out what they fly and help supply them. The less time they have to worry about logistics means more ISK for you.
---
If you want to go it alone then I'd look at items that are easy to make and sell quickly, like drones, ammo and rigs. Just watch out for the twats that sell products at under market value because they "mine" their own minerals and think it's for free. It's only free if you think your time is free, and it's not.
---
Also get yourself a good hauler such as a deep space transport, don't worry about a freighter just yet, and do all the moving yourself. Make friends so you don't fall victim to gate camps (mostly, but you will. I lost a JF so it will happen).
---
And best of luck.
---
If you know the names of that dudes, put em on red corp-standing, so your newbros see in a glimpse when those are around and they can get themselves safe. If You re in HS, well. Could potentially try a wardecc on them, gather ypir folks and show em the pointy end of some blasters.  
---
If you re in LS or Null even... Make some training-roams with T1-frigs with your gang, have ships for them ready around your usual area of activity and when the guys come... PEW. You might lose a bunch of frigs, but, hey, who cares? :)
---
Most people have multiple characters and talk about them in third person any way. It's ok to roll a girl.
---
&gt;Drones are damage dealing and all other damages types require significant ammo planning. Having drones do the same wouldn’t be such a stretch.
---
It would when "they don't consume ammo" is literally their main unique selling point.
---
&gt;That’s in fact a perfect example of a GOOD argument.
---
Wow, rude.
---
&gt;which is why I can only assume I’m getting such hate.
---
You're not getting "hate". You're getting disagreement, and you're too thin-skinned to tell the difference.
---
&gt;Hey I can live with infinite drones doing infinite damage. Doesn’t make sense, but it’s a space game.
---
A space game that you very clearly do not play.
---
&gt;No need to get your panties in a bunch and your tits all bent out of shape.
---
This entire comment is you getting your panties in a bunch and your tits all bent out of shape 
---
&gt;I’d rather have a bad idea than be a complete arsehole such as you. Later bud.
---
You're doing a good job of demonstrating that you can do both.
---
He can but really only on rigs
---
[deleted]
---
Make rigs that's about the only thign profitable for alphas
---
&gt;PvE capitals are the single greatest threat to the game as they not only destroy the economy but require supercap umbrellas and force players to consolidate into megacoalitions to protect them which is pretty much all the major problems resulting from an acute underlying cause that's very easy to identify if you dig even a little bit.
---
Wut
---
A ratting carrier gets slightly higher ticks than a blinged rattlesnake. Usually you'll make 90mil or so per hour.
---
If you think that is destroying the economy, you're deluded. Supercapitals are different to capitals. Ratting titans are different to ratting nids. Generalisations won't help you here.
---
Also after cyno changes, carriers aren't really easy saves, especially ratting fit ones.
---
&gt;Just sounds like "waaah I want my 150m/hr per alt" at this point. Inject into some hulks and use your Rorq as a booster instead.
---
You've complained about ratting caps, and Rorquals due to income. Why don't you complain about wormholers grinding sites to make significantly more money than any of the above?
---
That breaks the narrative. Does not compute
---
Phuck Snuff
---
Nothing to see here!
---
https://imgur.com/TXF5Otw
---
Why tf didn't they return the instant blackout went then?
---
&gt;Aka; these are people and their 20+ alt accounts that only rat/mine in safty of nullsec blob umbrella
---
This isn't as normal as you seem to think it is.
---
I did.
---
You just didn't read it.
---
Keep a few curses and lachs on field with the new bro. They get an escort while they makes the iskies. Prot decloaks, so do the curses and the lachs.
---
Prots shrivel up and die when medium neuts look at them, same is small neuts stare at them long enough.
---
Nope, I don't have to play like you tell me to. I've unsubscribed 6 of 10 accounts, and will unsub all soon if I don't find a way to play that *I* enjoy. __insert we don't want you any way here___
---
Oh, the *heavy* flame. A man of culture.

Tldr: Wrong guy got awoxed by mistake instead of fucking vertiso
---
Good luck but it'll be pretty hard against all the bots
---
third option: wormhole life
---
So true. I saw a post on here of a picture from the old forums that said it was dying in 2003 right after release. The truth is, as long as its profitable, it's not dying.
---
Never jump to a Adverse cyno :0
---
no, but is there a difference between 1 person with 20  total alt accounts  
---
and 5 people with 5 total alt accounts  
---
when both only play under their umbrella in the same systems
---
Don't break your arm jerking yourself off.
---
Gila. Get into a Gila as soon as you can. It's flexible and forgiving on skills but will function in most settings that a new player will try. It continues to improve with you as your skills improve. It functions well with T1 fittings and actually improves with T2 stuff when you get there. It allows new players to actually succeed in game events like the ones for various holidays where you can earn loot and skins.
---
It is not the end-all ship though. The Triglavian ships and gates are too much to handle for this little cruiser, but Abyssal space is readily achievable at tiers 1 and 2 for a new pilot. Just remember that you have to be out of the Abyssal site in under 20 minutes or you blow up.
---
Basically, you don't need to be perfect to fly this and do well. The game will suddenly feel a bit more fun since you can actually do some things. You can even do some mission running in it if you like.
---
It was my first good ship and I'll always think fondly of it. I did all the things I've mentioned with it even when I could barely fit it.
---
&gt; stabbed nano moros
---
they just put it out of its misery, mate

---
NGL, excited for the EU/USz split this time.
---
Industry isn't fast isk. The faster you want to cash out the less profit you will make. To maximize your profit the first thing you should do is make sure that the material costs of what you are building isn't above the value of the item to be produced. 
---
Then from there you need to (if you don't have max skills) sell your ore as sell orders not to buy orders, that means waiting. Use the isk from that to put up buy orders for the minerals you need (more waiting, and babysitting orders) then build the item with max researched blueprints in a rigged citadel then sell the produced items via sell orders and not to buy orders (even more waiting.)
---
It's a perfectly valid strategy to simply stop at the first step of selling the ore. It doesn't make you less of an industry person. Or to skip the mining process and start with putting buy orders up for minerals. What you should not do is consider the ore you mined and minerals you refine from it as free. Their value is at minimum what you can get selling them to buy orders.
---
Gotta farm those arcane Crystals!
---
lol guys
---
Seems like inner-corp deal,  TBF.  No idea if any alliance leadership was involved or not, but logic says - why would they? If a corp wants to do something, that doesn't involve or undermine the rest of the alliance - they are free to do whatever.
---
No real spy would admit to being a spy. So by saying yes, OP was proving that he wasn't one.
---
Fifty something... still horny as hell. Still have super hot femtoons. I let gf sculpt them.
---
Jesus only had twelve in his corp and one of them was a spy and awoxer.
---
Yes, this is very safe. You wouldn't last a day in nullsec with that nonsense.
---
Don't afk in a gila, you'll lose it fairly quickly and it takes forever to pay for itself. The only thing a gila is really good for these days is pvp and abyssal deadspace, for afk ratting use a myrm/domi
---
lol what
---
Swap the images for null and highsec.
---
Thank you for your understanding friend. I m sure you are not one of racist fascist SoB.
---
As for "Chinese player"issue, some CN players are notorious for botting/RMT. So it may brings about some cue which indicates Mangos also do RMT. And it is true that some evil-minded guys connect RR and AOM together and say these two are all botters, in a Chinese forum. 
---
So my reply is just trying to clarify 2 points: 
---
①: The reliability of this pic is very worth doubting.
---
②: At the time of this content is shown, both RR and AOM are still in Serenity.
---
And my personal view is: FUCK these botters. 
---
Botters and workshops behind them destroyed Serenity, and now TQ is the last utopia I can stay.
---
I really hate the experience that you get 10Bil from ratting a year, but 500 PLEX need 50Bil.
---
That was a disaster, and that is the reason why there are no young blood in Serenity.
---
Trust me, we Chinese don't like botting and botters at all.
---
Yeah no fucking shit there’s the bonus SP PLUS skilling spree, login campaigns work but they’re not organic lol
---
Might be, but doesn't change the fact the it is far from empty and chance of getting in a fight is higher.
---
Yeah, I heard FW is pretty dormant. But can also tell you the usual pipe-systems in LS tend to have some action in them. Not FW-wise, but camps n stuff. And, yeah, TZ has a huge impact.
---
Years ago yulai / rounon dax in provi also did some mining battle-fleets, was hilarious :)
---
www.getsharex.com
---
Just make anticap bombs.
---
500m explosion diameter, requiring precision launching. Huge damage multiplier based on signature radius - basically leaves subcaps alone but does massive damage to caps.
---
Caps are a huge problem in EVE and either need to get nerfed into the ground, or everything else needs to get buffed up big time. Fuck caps.
---
Seems you've had plenty guess I'll take a sip
---
I sure hope so but your corpmate who replied first doesn’t give me much hope
---
I love this. The only problem is mobility. Bombers are SO SLOW and hard to get around in. What if they had a remote boosher ability that allowed the FC to activate it and all the bombers would appear near him anchored up.
---
He's asking for a fight not your bank account details. Check your spaghetti-status, you're spilling them left and right.
---
No, because we want to punch others in the nuts. Its fun.
---
Anticap bombs would be a good idea in a meta where you could counter them.
---
The only thing I can see working are suicide ships (think of shadow fighter rage mode), so yes you can delete a capital, but it will take you some time until you can go for the next one.
---
When was that and are you sure the native client back then wasn’t just a prepackaged Wine setup? I played EVE on Linux 11 years ago and remember debugging issues with D3D on Wine.
---
Naw, that's not why i left.  I left because of the whole hearthstone fiasco.  Classic was everything i wanted it to be and i loved it.  But I've quit games for less of a disaster than what blizzard did.
---
Well, why leave CVA in the first place and then join THIS corp \*shrugs
---
cause CCP likes farms and fields for whatever reason and you have the most peasants
---
Valid question
---
12 mil per planet per day?
---
I thought my setup was fine with \~ 800mil a month on 5 Planets, how do you get that much?
---
i want to go back to the times where i could confidently engage a helpless, isolated mining ship without bringing half my alliance.
---
Shit. I need to get home and sell mine!
---
So... business as usual I guess.
---
still sounds more fun than fighting or joining the megabloc.
---
we don't need players like you that consume content without ever giving any back
---
pretty sure its to circumvent tax evasion with open market goods.  Otherwise everyone would just use contracts over market.  You can private contract though and avoid the fee altogether.
---
I love my space peeled potato (definitely gonna shelf it for a while and sell it's launchers if this price continues tho).
---
Lucrative? You'd get more money getting an extra job. You do you but.. You might need help.
---
yaay the bots are back :)
---
loving this. keep going.
---
I hope they still do, I still love Provi after all, always will. Amarr Victor.
---
Bio V is 256k sp, right? No, you won't. But in the long run there will be more accelerators from future events, so it will pay off. Off the top of my head, an extended accelerator is around 30k sp at default duration(3 days), so 60k over 6 days at bio V. When you've used the equivalent of 8 extended accels you'll get your sp back. However, you can now use drugs with double the duration, and that can be a big boost in PvP and some PvE.
---
shut up and buy more skins
---
Believe it or not Snuff doesn't normally awox their own titans. I know this is hard for you to believe because you are still ultra salty over Siseide, but this is a different scenario all together.
---
There already is an upper limit for ice, it has been there since they changed the ice belts to the 4 hour timer.
---
this
---
More like an empty purse.
---
i mean, good, they should be shown that civ modules suck. and shouldnt be there.
---
I call BS.
---
Wait you wanna deop on folks and not get killed and podded? How you figure you deserve this?
---
Well yes, but look how many structures and capitals you can run without even mining all the belts in New Eden, damn even bigger part of  sov nullsec, npc nullsec and lowsec are not touched. 
---
Like if there is this big upper limit - then there is no limit.
---
its pretty easy to tell why there is nothing going on in aridia. its because LSH drops their supers on everything bigger then a ceptor so noone bothers.
---
Nice choice of music.
---
We do get a huge Jita station, though. It probably is just for the eye, but who knows...
---
No spies.
---
So since the Avatar was SRP'd with a bus, do I train Neil into bus now? Prob should right
---
To keep reserves growing/stagnant
---
Also, the titan was already SRP'd -- thx for salt Mikal
---
Just go crazy with it - drones with remote control, fitting and such so you can personally kick T3C\`s ass by controlling your own drones on a second screen! Or just fit a Warrior I to kick a random tackler\`s butt:  
---
Warrior I \[Stiletto\`s Bane\] / 40 DPS:  
---
\[High\]  
---
35mm autocannon II x 800  Republic fleet Micro EMP S  
---
Compact Micro-Energy Neutralizer I  
---
\[Medium\]  
---
0.5 MN Microwarpdrive II  
---
Warp Scrambler II  
---
Nano Capacitor Booster I: Navy Duracell 25 x 10  
---
\[Low\]  
---
Gyrostabilizer II  
---
Energized Adaptive Micro Membrane II  
---
Corpus X-type micro armor repairer  
---
Damage control II
---
This triggers me to polor degrees
---
You have ful on Stockhom syndrome. Your Titan is dead and your corpbawoxed you. You are dead to snuff, let go, move on and get revenge or quit.
---
If you go begging to snuff leadership your gonna get emmotionally buckade, awoxed again and kicked.
---
Nice to see, still Tuz is heavily pusing a false narrative, that its all because balckout ended. That is wrong, it partly is because of blackout drove away afk-PvE (I DONT say bots) and they returned, and because of Skillpoint events. Still I would like to see 60k logins again as we had them before all the patches that Tuz will heavily deny being the reason for that 50% drop.
---
I too really like this game. I don't play it super much and perhaps I should, but I'm still super happy it's still recovering as always.
---
I resub'd for blackout. Might let it expire at the end of the month though, just waiting to see what happens.
---
so not the guy from 12 years ago then.  I could have sworn there was some dude with the same or similar name in that corp with Gimley G and the great Ben Booly.  zkill doesn't go back that far so looking up the killmails is very hard.
---
WH'er pic:

https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/c/c5/Profile_-_Tamatoa.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20190627030539
---
I unsubbed.  But then I'm saving for a new car and then a new PC and then a new refrigerator and then some new underpants, in that order.
---
Do you happen to have those fits?
---
My point was what I stated. Whatever further depths you feel need to be discussed is for you to deal with my friend. 
---
Obviously a sensitive topic though.
---
I gave one of those people my titan he left snuff still gave it back. Would trust adversity again tbh
---
Upvoting PGL, but yeah if you want content consider moving out of the ass end of dog dick nowhere.
---
He can be glad Snuffed is not in the Imperium anymore.
---
That kind of fuckery is Kommissar'able for fucks sake, you don't shoot blues you stupid fucking retarded dipshit son of a harbour whore.
---
If you do shit like this it escalates into a total clusterfuck because you can indeed call for homedefense if a blue is shooting you or your stuff.
---
You don't shoot blues. Period.
---
They both work tbh. Crying Krab Babies?
---
more please.
---
It feels contrived to me. Because i've only met one wh group in combat that actually respected any of it. every other corp that has rolled in to us has stomped us with vastly superior numbers (typically jumping in 5-10 additional dudes after we were tackled) or if we got eyes on them and their additional reinforcements just didn't fight with them. 
---
The only thing that feels true about wormhole bushido is that to larger groups and you have to pay tribute in fed ships or you are a carebear that never undocks for pvp.
---
A common thing on Sundays.
---
I´d gold you but i´m a greedy asshole so have some virtual backpatting instead.
---
yeah they've been doing battlecruiser roams for months now
---
seems to be a competent group not afraid to take larger doctrines out to force good fights
---
Isnt havoc the guy lex doxxed for losing a hel? Just wow.
---
You’re in wrong lowsec
---
I stopped playing cause I thought they didnt have a linux verson, I guess i need to get back in
---
yep.
---
Anything happen to the guy(s) that awoxed you?
---
I preemptively decimate my brain cells before every fleet with a proprietary mix of prescription drugs and spirits.
---
There may well be something alive in my trash can. Doesn't mean I want to live there.
---
If anyone has EBR numbers for when they're experiencing this, throw them my way.
---
And yes, everyone experiencing it should submit bugs. So some form of commonality might be worked out.
---
Because this sounds more like network issues, then server side.
---
For the Man-Emperor of Mankind.
---
 If you don't know where this is from and you call yourself a 40k fan, I will laugh. Hard.
---
T3s are AFK enough to run on a second screen/tabbed out
---
Your CEO is a pussy. Everyone knows TDSIN doesn't fight for anything but 5-3s.
---
Tishu Edition
---
&gt;Only bring 3 haw dreads and not carriers to kill your roam
---
???
---
I was talking about wormhole bushido which is 3 capitals max in an armor brawl out of fairness to the Corp that has to jump in. I used the phrase "fight not a slaughter" to segue into making fun of people out in 0.0 who dont know the difference.
---
Hockey fights are fun to watch tho.
---
&gt;scanning can seem like a arcane, time consuming process
---
It is, after you get to cov-ops/SOE, train the skills, and can fit all T2 scanning rigs and mods, it feels a little better, definitely faster, but it's hard to teach.
---
Sure, assuming I had a 6m + training plan all mapped out and didn't change what I was training all the time as I decided I wanted to try different things. I've been playing on and off for a decade and I still don't know what I want to do in EVE. Still have never used a remap and honestly don't miss the lost SP.
---
So? Don't check? Give the community *the functionality*, not the packs. We can sort it out with all our 3rd party tools.
---
Like what's so hard about making your problems other people's problems when you have too many problems?
---
Probably the most efficient (fast) ISK though, through exploration. Unless you're going to null, exploration in wh space can make you hundreds of millions of ISK pretty easily.
---
when did I cry? I just stated a fact. Who bothers going there.+, also why people keep coming back to delve? I thought dropping them with supers would prevent them for doing so but no people still come into delve while they dont belong there.   
---
LSH has Aridia under good control and all the pipes covert so noone really wants to go in there.
---
Have you been sleeping the past 4-5 years? Nearly all changes they made heavily favoured Nullsec, and especially PvE in Sov-Nullsec while meanwhile literally killing playstyles of other areas (NPC-Null, Lowsec)
---
It's barely passable. It's 100% scripted, with the same spawns every single time. It could use a shake up, with some randomization, to make it a little more interesting to do. And also to drop the whole AFK'able meta that has been emerging the last few years.
---
And no, that would be excellent. The sites where thought out and balanced around subcaps, which is why capitals are skewing the balance so heavily in their favour. For example they can completely ignore any form of tank, and just go full out damage application. There should at the very least be some kind of risk when fitting in such a way, but right now that isn't the case. 
---
What they could do was to introduce sites made for capitals. Maybe with escalations attached that would drop faction/officer capitals modules... Or something along those lines.
---
"If it's a good guide, it's a good guide"
---
Spot on!
---
I love these notifications. They keep me from undocking in a Higgs bs with no modules turned on
---
Of course not, [random asshole fc from any alliance] is a god damn asshole. I'll just press the wrong numpad key and casually go "holy shit is that 500 battleships clustered inside a bubble 125km off the gate of fk-y0u? holy shit somebody is about to be murder fucked if they warp in from the sun/keepstar/anom."

If it was just me doing it, you wouldn't all be so obsessed with the rollercoaster the pcu is on.
---
were over 20,000 bots back in game. AWESOME makes the game SO much more fun for everyone....
---
hmmm
---
&gt;They imagined mining fleets needing to be actively protected by combat players.
---
That's literally what the umbrella is.
---
You have yourself a follower.
---
Quick edit: I suspect some of the tracks from the Moon soundtrack would fit here nicely too.
---
SC is more an updated elite dangerous than an eve online.
---
they cannot be compared as they have completely different games.
---
economy and whats at risk is completely different too.
---
Please explain Nidia.
---
Top tier bullshit busywork detected.
---
Kestrel with a single medium shield extender and a damage control has 5.16k ehp, with a dcu and a 400mm plate it has 5.39k ehp. So you are going to have to define optimal a little more carefully.
---
400 mm is 0.0019883878159999997 furlongs
---
^^^[WHY](/r/UselessConversionBot/comments/1knas0/hi_im_useless/)
---
LMAO! You really expect anyone to take you seriously when you clearly don't know a thing? Good luck with that. Oh and next time, you should slowly escalate. You blew your load way too early when you jumped your whole fleet in :)
---
Might replace "needing to be protected" with "being in danger". Which are 2 different things.
---
I’m sorry.. but... this is a clear indication of stage 4 Spod brain. It’s terminal... I hear they have great hospice care in Doomheim.
---
This is the most ridiculous thing.   
---
Have you seen the shear amount of effort, changes, and buffs that have been targeted at nullsec:  Ships buffed/nerfed based on what nullsec does with them (over 90% of ship changes are "because null"), fundamental changed to nullsec territory control every year or three, most of the new structures are geared towards null, and whatever else.
---
______________
---
If anything the rest of the community is exhausted by how much attention nullsec gets.   I know the 2nd to last time I left EVE was because the only update I saw to my playstyle "maybe"  was T3 destroyers,  Then ALL DEV TIME was going to be shoved into structure/sov changes.   
---
Then I rejoined when it looked like CCP was starting to realize "oh wow we have lots of issues" with the null local change.   Just for it to be whined away by null.
---
This is the first thing I've seen that makes me regret not going to EVE Vegas.
---
That would probably be because the the scorpion, scorpion navy issue, Rattlesnake and widow are basically the same ship model
---
As someone else said. Seed your own market or find a secondary hub. Usually where there is a lot of mission running or boarding faction warfare.
---
Stacmon: on the edge of FW space and is 9 jumps away from dodixie. You can mark up here and the volume is not bad.
---
Ichoryia: is this still a caldari mission hub? Not a bad choice.
---
&gt;shut your cock holster
---
Sigh, have an upvote.
---
In part; as folks noted elsewhere, T2 (and faction) guns also provide the users more ammo options that can further boost one or more of damage/range/application.
---
I'm still having issues getting things running on ubuntu :/ tho shootout to gharim turen for their help!
---
This is now possible! Use `!thera notify when nullsec` to enable your filter. ^^
---
Can confirm true.
---
Stain removed? CCPlease
---
You can now use filter to only by notified when the wormhole connects to certain systems, constellations or regions! Use `!thera notify when jita` (example) to enable.
---
Nothing will.
---
Panfam is the cancer now.
---
If you stop posting.
---
You can now add a filters for connections to certain systems, constellations or regions. Use `!thera notify when XYZ` to enable.
---
I often think CCP doesn't want new players.
---
*looks at post title once again*
---
I didn't see anything if you pmed me..
---
Trap them. Cloaky pilgrim or arazu traps. Get an arazu, SB proteus and a stealth bomber to hang out cloaked waiting. Keep some other dps on hand somewhere or even T1 cloaked. After the kill, smartbomb the pod.
---
It might be tedious waiting for them for a bit. But, here's the thing- you'll probably only have to do this a few times before they'll likely stop. If they had the force projection to escalate into real fights they'd be giving you fights already.

1. Buy a Magnate and fit for low align time and max cargo

2. Use [https://evetrade.space](https://evetrade.space/) to see arbitrage trading opportunities between regional hubs or specific stations.

3. Check on [https://evemarketer.com](https://evemarketer.com/) that the orders are still around and/or not a [margin trading scam](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Scams_in_EVE_Online#The_Margin_Trading_Scam)

4. Buy low-volume, high-margin products to ship from Jita to your trade hub

5. Sell for a profit

6. Start back at 2
---
I started with a Magnate, then quick align Sigil, then Prorator and ended up finding a few specific and regular items to arbitrage between two markets.

Part of the problem imo is that specialising an alpha toon into high-class wormhole pve takes a long time and really isn't that beneficial for much else. 
---
Technically an alpha can, within the 5m sp limit, contribute a rattle or nestor for a high-class pve group but with all the support skills and such you'd want you wont be able to do much else with the toon.
---
The real hard limit is your cloaky potential. If you don't care about having covert ops cloaks there are things you can do with battleships, otherwise I think you're pretty much stuck with T3 cruisers. If you don't mind a non-covert cloak I know that a well fit Rattlesnake can do any site in a C3 without too much trouble as long as it can refit with a mobile depot in the site.
---
If you have to ask you probably don't know enough to be successful.
---
check your messages. I PMd you. PM me if you can't find it
---
I like how you in no way address my comment.
---
Just get the tengu don't bother with the orca.
---
I use 3 cloaky PVP fit Tengus to run c3 sites. Each can solo it but together it's faster.
---
Then I have a fourth account cloaked in an orca.
---
No pos, no citadel, just me and my suitcase.
---
Let the hunted become the hunter. Setup some "easy" targets for them to engage then swoop in and wreck their shit, loot the wrecks, rinse and repeat until they get the message.
---
That or a revamped roll-out of Dust 514 Version 2.0
---
I mean, if those ships would fit for anything other than straight ticks they'd probably live longer. And if you actually tried forming a fleet for a good fight instead of either docking up and turtling or dropping twenty supers on everything then you might have a better time.
---
When we go roaming, we're looking to get decent fights out of it. We'll usually hang around and see if you'll form anything good after blapping your spodbrain ISK-at-any-cost krabbers.
---
This works wonderfully on paper. What more often actually happens is the Rorq PANICs, supers get dropped, and then they just sit there and completely deny content.
---
Loki is almost just strictly better than the Tengu right now. The HAM legion is also somewhat viable. If you don't care about cloaky, Rattlesnake (or kinda-pricy Gila) works too.
---
Yes, so it's inherently not the traveling that is entertaining in that context.
---
Getting from A-B is pretty much always boring. The way to generally make this manageable is making it short/skippable which makes the world small, interrupt the traveling which makes the play time more interesting but also takes longer to get where you are going, or make the experience so beautiful, you're entertained while nothing is happening.
---
All open world games have these issues.
---
Assassin's Creed is probably the only one that sort of handles this, because the parkour can be fun and not get you wasting too much time, but it's rare that the good parkour routes lead where you are going directly and they get tedious the 30th time you've gone through the same area.
---
It got worse once they have you spending all your time on a boat or horse.
---
Blood raider faction drones, problem solved.
---
I remember this! We always yelled "I SCREAM, I SCREAM!" when it played.
---
None of those remotely attempted to approach the scope and depth of eve.
---
Start citizen promises to. I don't think it will ever be near what it's promise is but it's possible.
---
EVE is primed to be dethroned since the core gameplay loop is so bad. It's the depth of the world systems that make EVE interesting, so even something with 75% of those, but with a better gameplay loop will suck up all the new players easily.
---
thanks for the input, i just experienced a catastrophic series of losses so it doesnt really matter at this point but ill work on rep as i rebuild
---
thanks, glad you like it!
---
But would they really be rouge drones?
---
What Loki fit would you recommend?
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again..."I love being a ~~turtle~~ wormholer"
---
Tried the Legion, the tank was kinda lack luster unless i gimped dps, it’s also slow as all hell without an mwd, limiting it tank potential due to cap.
---
99% are farm, 
---
I'd say that you're unlucky as we probably find 1 or 2 system a week that are abandonned or LP
---
also LP citadels don't tends to stat LP for long pp
---
Rattlesnake can pull over 200m an hour in C3 sites.  Highly recommend that.
---
Just teach people to get angry at reddit posts and always remember to remind people that they are better than them. At everything. Pretty much a degree in wormhole btw.
---
More accurate portrayal of Lowsec: https://imgur.com/26INU1M

Get this, CCP does not need to accept said banks cards, oh golly.
---
&gt; It’s not a great WH for experienced pilots but ideal for those wanting to learn the ropes and make considerably more ISK

The point is, in my 15 years in eve, the amount of time i have heard that 'Hey new game XX will kill eve just you watch' has been extensive.  And eve is still here.  SC is crap, it will never come out.  Its a pretty buggy mess.  And gets worse because CR has a hard on for adding crap and not finishing anything (he is worse then CCP).  The only thing that will kill eve is CCP.

You shouldn't use government logic in real life.

---
&gt;blackout drove away afk-PvE
---
Sorry, that's unlikely to be true. We have both destruction data and players online data, and during the blackout the curves were nearly identical. If only "PVE people" were leaving, relative destruction would be higher.
---
https://i.imgur.com/AhF05Cr.png to illustrate. Thick blue is destruction from CCP MER, green is player count at Sundays 19:00.

Have to replace Kestrel State Issue with "Shield Slaves", then your list is 100% spot on
---
I palyed a bit as miner/industry and learned a few skills for that but it wasn't that much fun and now I'd like to try PVE/PVP. Should I make a new character because I already learned some skilsl that are now useless or is it no problem that I already used some of my skill points?
---
I completely forgot about tiericide and shield slaves. They should have been on the list instead of my meme responses tbh.
---
53047 - PLACEHOLDER CONCORD STELLAR OBSERVATORY
---
It'd be nice if this was expensive enough so that there were wide swaths of blackout space interrupted by illuminated pockets of safety, but knowing CCP citadel preferences they'll probably be super cheap and able to anchor 50 of them in range of a keepstar doomsday.
---
Honestly to perma seed a hole with combat toons, seems like you have to be either massively feeding or managed to piss people off beyond believe, so i suspect there is part of the story you either don't known or are not telling us.
---
FW mission nerf?
---
Remove them entirely. We want a war, not an LP farm to get them alts of civilians more titans to harass FW pvp'ers.
---
&gt;Yes, so it's inherently not the traveling that is entertaining in that context.
---
I'm trying to explain to you how stupid and useless it is to think like that because nothing is designed to be fun alone. 
---
By that logic nothing is fun because it isn't inherently fun, and I can't think of a base game system that would be fun alone. Traveling in sea of thieves isn't fun. It's fun when you're manning the sails and riding through waves. Shooting in csgo isn't inherently fun. Yea people find aim maps fun, but that's the feeling of success when you start popping those headshots. It's not just the shooting. Throwing nades isn't fun because you're just clicking your left or right mouse button. Trying to learn new nade spots IS fun, but that's not inherent, that's satisfaction derived from knowing you can do it in an actual game to maybe win a few extra rounds and games to rank up. 
---
What's the point of saying "Oh well with 0 other things involved it isn't fun" even though that's not how anything in life works? That kind of statement doesn't actually mean anything.
---
i had a ticket open and got nothing helpfull back^^ i saw some heavy drops in the morning whre zayo changed rounting on the de-cix as i saw but not the later hops trugh netherland and to the uk where the problem to T! seems to be sitting...

right now i got 3 following disconnects with the same behaivior as in my picture above @ about full hour+19min https://i.imgur.com/RLs5OKi.png
---
Dont feel bad, CCP forgot about them too ;)
---
I'd be even happier if they were removed too.
---
Your graph literally supports my point, as you can see clearly the increase in destruction during the 1st days of blackout, when a lot of PvE players had not adapted (unsubbed) yet. If they prey is offline nothing can be destructed...
---
Another thing your graph nicely shows, that the loss in players since january up to the start of blackout was higher than the logins lost due to blackout ( appr. 7.5k from January until blackout, about 5k during blackout ...)
---
High-Sec doesn't pretend to be anything more, nor demand that the most lucrative part of space be perfectly safe while pretending that they're badasses for living there under the protection of endless capital fleets. I respect them more for that.
---
You don't have to go home. But we don't have to feed to you either.

Pretty much this.  
---
Back in the day they were a gold mine, but a half a dozen nerfs later, the last time I took one out they brought in 100-125m/hr in ore.  That is not liquid ISK.  That’s ore that needs to be sold, refined, or made into something.

There is a direct mention of a new dynamic hangar sound system. So coding resource is being spent here.

"Anti Logi EWAR" what do you mean with that? ECM Neuts and Damps are already useful against anything not a fax (and yeah fax need a nerf).
---
Oh I understand it, I'm saying I don't like it.
---
Thank you, looks dope!
---
Damn I like all of these, but I'm scared what CCP's take on "rework" means.
---
In other words they are not easy ‘content generators (aka sweet sweet capital loot Piñata) for every small gang that is roaming around.  
---
That said, i have seen a bunch go down to SB and well put together fleets, even in Delve.  You bring enough DPS in, and have good target choice, the defending team is going to loose one are two before the response team is on grid.
---
There is also a lot of empire navy ships. FW shakeup?
---
Oh, I definitely agree.
---
But as I've said, it's not so much that EVE is perfect, so much as those some said would kill it never really competed.
---
EVE is the only game like EVE.
---
SC actually promises to be like EVE, but they have definitely made some decisions that undermine their own ability to do what they promise (lifetime insurance, etc)
---

And then make the argument you aren't strawmanning.

The point of travel is to GET somewhere. You're inherently doing it not because it's fun, but to get to somewhere that is fun.

Uh, yes. Tons of stuff. I'm not sure how saying I dislike a specific way of playing implies I don't like anything?

&gt;You're inherently doing it not because it's fun, but to get to somewhere that is fun

I mean isnt that what I said above? Shooting in CS isn't fun, but it allows you to get kills, beat other players, win more games, etc. But that's part of it. Shooting nerds and moving in CS is the vehicle by which you have fun. You can't ignore the parts of the game meant to give a system purpose and say it isn't fun.
---
Now if you want to say travel isn't fun because everyone is consolidated into giant umbrellas and there're giant dead zones in null then yea.
---
Why don’t you go report me again

If the trig dread follows the same pattern, the price will probably settle down around 2-2.5 times the cost of a normal dread (hull of course).
---
TBH CCP should spawn higsec faction rats in null that you can kill as they invade your sov space :D
---
It probably has something to do with alliances not wanting to buy fitted ships and put them on contracts for the few people in game that dont ha very that t2 gun.
---
What'd you come up with for the Legion? I could run it in tandem with my Tengu/Loki and lose two ships to wingspan at the same time.
---
If teaching newbros how to live in Wspace is what you really want to do, I’d suggest finding a solid and active mid-size group and working up to be a recruiter for them. Filling a hole with all newbros is a recipe for disaster if someone decides they want to camp them in for easy kills. You need a good veteran backbone of 3+ players all willing to grow and teach a new group and carve your own name out. I’ve seen countless “newbros friendly” groups form, get camped, and wither as the newbros come to think Wspace is all about being camped in. Show them the other side of things and they’ll have more fun.
---
Yeah, that's pretty unacceptable.

---
What is my 1 legion and my buddies 1 retribution supposed to do against 20 cerbs?
---
I can't ping for more dudes at that time zone, they are just aren't available. And then people are upset because they see me running around, alone, but i won't feed them. Undocking a single ship against 20 isn't a challenge its just a feed.
---
Well done sir, Rengas is a good buddy of mine, sad to see it die, but much better way to go out than sitting in some dumb collectors hanger. I wish you got a KM to go with the accomplishment.
---
You're being needlessly reductionist.
---
But yes, most of nullsec is empty, and it's primarily because of how easily super groups can move through this empty space to secure their borders.
---
If it was more difficult and more costly, it would give some more opportunity for more entities to take up residence in these areas.
---
I don't necessarily agree that going after ice is the way to do this, but it could be one part of it.
---
In highsec, outside of missions and incursions, the rats (NPCs) are pretty tame. Except the ones with a diamond (◆) or Tyrannos in the name—those rats are deadly. If you want specific help register on https://zkillboard.com/ and link a loss here.

---
Bovril think-tank: “no wayyyy! Whaaat?!!! This means if he actually spies on us then we can’t hold him accountable since he already put us on notice that he’s a spy!”
---
Bovril members: “yeah wtf?! Each of us promised we aren’t spies. At this point if you let some one in without that promise then that’s unfair to the rest of us because we gave up something to be a bovril member!”
---
Bovril recruiter: “that’s right! This must be a mistake. Ask him to confirm that he is indeed a spy!”
---
&lt;second confirmation comes along&gt;
---
Bovril recruiter: “it’s definitively confirmed! He said he’s a spy TWICE!”
---
Bovril-collective: “we’re under a spy attack!!! But our defenses held! Get fucked spies!!!”

---
But in all honesty they probably didn’t want op fire whatever reason and used this as a pretext.

I think it's funny and that's why I'm in Goons.

"You're being needlessly reductionist."

Rengas is a fucking machine. I fed to him so many timed in 2013 in Rahadalon. Probably one of the best ways for the dude to lose an AT ship; died in true "No man can kill me!" fashion to the abyssal depths instead of getting baited and cap / blops blobbed by lowsec F1 monkeys.

&gt; While pleasantly dreaming, I'd be giving them an excuse, a reason, a motivation to look closely enough, and they'd realize quickly what I am. In these situations where we are uncovered, alone and incognito, lurking amongst the masses, they find it easier to just shoot us.

Just walk up to them as they amble tiredly towards a shuttle and then boom, spray, bang, zap...who knows, but it's lights out either way and I'm laughing all the way to the nearest clone bank.
---
&gt; I could be here to solve all kinds of problems. Or, I suppose, cause them.
---
&gt; Whatever it is, it's assured by default that whenever a capsuleer is trying to blend with the baseliners (b-lining, they say – rather repugnant if you consider it) it's not because they're here to mingle.
---
&gt; Besides, the mechanics of it all are for them the same as mine. They have the authority to act with lethal force at a moment's notice. Against us, that is.
---
/r/evejobs is worth a try. The usual newbro corps from goons and tapi may or may not be recruiting (i’m not affiliated with either so i dunno, give it a try however)
---
you don't get a killmail when the person dies from timeout, just a lossmail to npc's
---
[bit late bud](https://i.imgur.com/HP3zjGN.png)
---
This corp was made before B-R that's how old it is.
---
I'm going to agree with your statement, but perhaps you didn't mean it like that.
---
They have them split into these groups. So I posted the groups.
---
Don't Ikis slam dunk on every normal cruiser in the game except for Curse and Ashimmu.
---
I kinda doubt it will become the norm. He amount of time it takes to spool up is a pretty big hinderance in anything that isn’t on the small to medium end of engagements. 
---
And no doubt their price will be rediculous compared to just adding more dreads (or Supers).
---
I know, but this is showing as a "new item," so I'm going to assume they're doing something with it this time.
---
gonna suck my own dick if this guy doesnt RMT
---
remote repairing dreadnaughts?
---
Do they WANT a new slowcats doctrine?
---
No, you're just annoying.  Nobody needs 20 posts from you, each with a different hoboleak link.  Just put them all in one.  This is just fucking annoying.
---
looks awesome, great job
---
god i love damps keres is god
---
ffs xD
---
owns a molok but uses EM dd :cripes:
---
I'm not saying you do, I'm just saying it only seems contrived to you because you don't actually have a fleet. That said if you are looking for "honor brawls" it helps to ask, people don't automagically know your numbers etc and it sounds to me like you are just charging in and getting tackled and expecting to not get dunked, it doesn't work like that...which is another reason I believe it to be less contrived than you or perhaps the general k-space population would believe.
---
No hard feelings just casually shit talking to blow the steam. Lov u &lt;3
---
suddenly carrying anything in a freighter is too much.
---
Hm okay I might be! When you say abandonned you mean zero citadels?
---
It's true they are farms but they can still be defended, would be cheaper to defend one than attack for me.
---
Lol:)
---
My thought as well. I was initially excited by the idea of them being titan killers before I realized that regular dreads will pop a titan long before the Trig spool up time completes.
---
Youre always salty dude.
---
Eve has sound?
---
On a Myrm? Nope, 5 hardpoints.
---
You'll be getting free ships and mpdules for helping out friendly npc fleets/ doing plexes. Look at the defensive module crate and the frigate/ dessy crates. Im actually pumped for that.
---
Thanks, did a bunch of these during the summer but have been busy so just screenshots lately :(
---
&gt; Current costs indicate that it would be barely more expensive than the normal ones after the initial hype. Then again, it's not the final version yet.
---
This also doesn't take into account the value of rarity.
---
Marshals don't cost more than other blops to build, and while they are better, they're pure utility doesn't make more the entirety of their premium.
---
I can see that.
---
Unfortunately your request must be denied. It does not follow proper CCP bot report protocols.
---
In order to get the attention of the CCP security team, you must first rewrite your request in Icelandic, in the form of a haiku. Then convert that to binary using standard asci. Once ready, it must be sent to the team using smoke signals from the Reykjavik peer, between the hours of 11:00 and 11:15 on the thirteenth of an odd month. (As long as it's a weekday, of course.)
---
Until such time as the request is delivered in such a format, the bots will be considered valued customers.
---
Also, due to privacy concerns, no request receipt confirmation or info on actions taken will be provided.
---
Might be a popup that appears if it happens by chance. I think they roll 50% on each item, so it could happen but super rarely.
---
Check if it's still overloaded with Compact mods. I'd also check if you get more cap by swapping one of the CCC rigs for Ancillary Current Router and large battery. Don't have Pyfa nearby to check.
---
Honour point refers to webs? thought it was hull tanked at first :P
---
New player (alpha) here. I don't know what if I want to play PVP, PVE, miner, industry or whatever. Are there any skills that i should learn regardless of what I want t do? I'm asking because I've read that there's a skill cap for alpha players
---
Ah yes 5 years ago, seems like a valid argument. Moron
---
Cool.  Now, if only we had WiS.
---
Insane idea, make them cheap but limit one anchored per system/constellation.
---
it doesn't really matter so long as you can't repair in siege and your DPS is terrible in siege.
---
Its just a copy-paste of the usual Triglavian bonus. The smartbomb bonus basically does nothing due to how negligible smartbomb cap usage is to caps.
---
I doubt its going to be an issue with how CCP treats the rest of the lineup. But yes, blueprints would be one of the limiting factors. 
---
Also Marshall costs alot because of the actual effort required to get it. If the BPC just drops from sites that also pay up in ISK or other loot, its value would be much lower
---
You mean shield amulets?
---
you know its gonna be an update like pirates of the sea right...more skins, ship skins, vip station skins, elite citadel skins etc etc
---
yes please
---
AW0XU is a p chill... wait nvm they are the worst
---
You'd suck your dick anyway. Don't lie.
---
as much as i like new ships, especially trigs. i just wish ccp would finally start fixing stuff...
---
Not as easy to see the skin on Minmatar as the others, but still cool.
---
Cool, but nobody would ever really see them
---
Bullshit detector determines you aren't bullshitting. I miss fighting your boy Seddow in throwaway cruisers. Give him back.
---
Triglavian standings when?
---
Yes. Lots of things. I, however, am not limited to being able to focus on just one thing like those small minded bigots that think racism is fun or funny or cool. Begone tiny dick
---
So woke.
---
why do you want to say racial slurs so badly    
---
what do you gain from being able to do so
---
look are we talking play pretend eve spies and fiction or actual people that spy in eve, cause in reality once your spy gets found out he either goes to a low effort place like horde/goons/test or the char gets recycled.   
---
The corp history of a person with multiple corps for minimum time does not indicate spy but uninterested person or drama queen that fights everywhere he goes. Also if an HR doent check his story with his previous corp / corps its a joke of an HR.
---
yea it resembles more of a walker.  YY would have been better
---
dont you have something better to do than [checks notes] defend saying racial slurs for no reason(???)
---
That would be so cool.
---
However this time they do it right and release it on psp vita.
---
The first time I heard of this meme was yesterday, now I see it again. [Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases#Frequency_illusion) strikes again.
---
lmao how bad do you have to be to fit a Fiend like that
---
I'm a High-Sec solo miner (Omega) based out of Hek in Minmattar space. I've come back from a long hiatus and have fully trained Exhumer skills. While I'm still all about breaking rocks, I've started doing L1-L2 Security missions on the side for fun and salvaging. As a result, I've finally begun training Medium spaceship command skills for bigger hulls and bigger booms. I'm currently using a Hurricane with medium turrets, passive shield tank, active armor tank, two medium drones, and three small drones.
---
**Question 1 -- Do I have a chance at successfully completing an Abyssal Filament with my Hurricane?** I'm hesitant to try out a L1 filament since failure = clone death and I have a bunch of implants. I dominate L2 missions and L2 Angel Dens, but barely scratch Triglavian frigates at Emerging Conduits before I'm forced to retreat.
---
**Question 2 -- How do I get L3 Security missions?** Every L3 Security Agent I could find was hanging out in their ship near a Beacon in their solar system. When I warped in and spoke with them, they all said "I have no missions for you, come back later" or something to that effect. I have more than enough Minmattar standing for L3 Agents, so how do I access their missions? (note: every L3 Security agent I could find via the Agent Finder had a tiny, dark red corner/chevron thing in the top left corner of their portrait; maybe that has something to do with it?)
---
**Question 3 -- How do I survive trips through Low-Sec? Is there a way to resist/break tackling?** When I bought my first Hurricane, I found one for 15,000,000 ISK below the next best price. The downside was the only way to get to it was through a 0.3 system. Got to the Hurricane just fine, then got blowed-up immediately upon jumping to the 0.3 system on my return trip. Fortunately the Hurricane was completely empty so I only lost 25,000,000 ISK or so, but I've also lost a Stabber, Thrasher, and Fleet-Issue Stabber (all fully armed and tanked) to Low-Sec gatecampers over the last few months. Same thing each time: 1-2 T2 cruisers/battlecruisers tackle me, web me, dump unholy amounts of DPS on me, and the most I can do is knock down their shield a percent or two with my half-dozen turrets and limp a few hundred meters away before my ship blows up. The key thing is I feel completely powerless; any Low-Sec gate could have a camper, every camper I've encountered so far has absolutely annihilated me regardless of how big and tanky (or fast and agile) my ship is, and my only chance for survival (warp out) is never available since I'm always tackled. At the moment, each jump through Low-Sec is a roll of the dice with an unpredictable ~20% chance of instant-death. It seems to me the only way to survive gate-camping is to avoid Low-Sec entirely. However, not only does that severely restrict my options for gameplay (e.g. I want to be able to eventually run Minmattar's Epic Arc), it would mean letting myself get pushed around by scummy gate-campers. Fuck that. Gate-campers are the bottom of the barrel and, moreover, they're not going anywhere. I'll need to learn how to handle them sooner or later, just as with any pest. At the moment I'd settle for a way to blockade-run their camp by negating tackling, but if there's some way for me to fight back that won't end with me as a cloud of glowing dust I'd love to hear it.

So does that mean that ShipBrowser Ambient sound will be classified correctly and STFU when Ambient Sound/Music is turned off?

How do you envision incursion style payouts for anoms working? I don't think I understand. Or do you mean just that it's a payout for the whole site?

As much as I'd love to rail on some goon director for letting it in, it's really really easy to just hit the Accept button on the corp invite without paying too much attention to the details of the corp.  Especially with an alliance as large as theirs.  The director guy was probably just on autopilot accepting a bunch of corps that their out of game management tool said it was OK to accept.
---
First they didn't chose to send your stuff there it's called asset saftey.
---
Second I'm recruiting for a small class 2 wormhole hs Corp if your interested. Mostly pve and indy but not afraid of a fight.
---
hell lets just have them nerf the whole game. each race can have one ship and well remove two of the races so its literally rock paper scissors.
---
you people need to chill out with the nerf request bullshit
---
You have no defense here, just admit it. Are you really okay with that?
---
I hear it smells like a turd covered in burnt hair.
---
I think what they should do is make it so that having an observatory structure in a system "scares" some of the rats away. Meaning the best money making is out in the dark. 
---
And...uh...scares the moons too because fuck em.
---
Make sure and post this in the forum.  And tag falcon in this.  Cause maybe he might chuckle?
---
Alphas will have a hard time in WHs, but it won't be impossible and it could be a lot more fun.  The biggest threat you will face is the lack of cloaking.  Since WHs don't automatically put you into local chat, you can be completely invisible, but that means so is everyone else.  If you're uncloaked, you become a target rather quickly.  This doesn't make it impossible, though.  You can use various tricks to make yourself hard to catch.
---
Combat sites will be tricky for you.  You won't be able to run them as efficiently as omegas and in WHs, speed is important.  You can huff gas and run exploration sites, though, which can make you good money, a lot better than anything in HS will.  If you're willing to put in the time to train skills and the effort to practice some tricks, you can be very competent in them.
---
There are two approaches to starting to get into WHs.  You could either join a corp that lives in WHs or "day trip" which means basing out of a HS system and jumping into whatever WHs pop up nearby.  I've done both and I would highly recommend the corp route.  You will meet friends, you will get support, and they will often have things scanned down for you to do which saves you a ton of time.
---
Feel free to PM me with questions you have.  I'd be happy to help!
---
Or, they can make it so anchoring one lowers the value of the system it's in. Meaning the best money is in systems with no local.
---
No u
---
got me
---
Oh wow I only heard of Baader-Meinhof yesterday
---
English recruitment channel pretty active.
---
People are racist yeah. It’s not good. I really could care less about a Corp name to get worked up about tho. They are childish and won’t grow up move on.
---
I don't have my hopes up for them doing anything that isn't some form of minor change plus some padding.
---
when the timer kill you noone get a killmail for some reason
---
revs have 8 lows and resistance bonus
---
"*Sir, it's an old meme, but it checks out*"
---
Ganking newbros in some flying scrap isnt really that much of a padding
---
Only sites you'll have issues with is relic/data there is one *can't remember the name of it* that spawn the next wave as soon as you hit the battleship so you end up with three bs worth of dps on you.
---
Besides that site tho a loki with moderate bling can run everything.
---
I'd say heavies with a web. I don't fly the loki cuz I use the tengu but they're very close in relative power big bonus is the web and resists are different.
---
lmao
---
Corp != alliance but I hear ya
---
Decisions will be made but not today
---
oh OK thanks! the asteroid belts i go to are usually abandoned til you hang out for awhile though(like if your mining).
---
&gt; Why does it always have to be about "triggering?"
---
because if they are just trying to get a laugh, they can't possibly be racists, duh.
---
To win at bingo, the game host has to draw the cards first right ? I feel like we will all end up with a draw :)
---
*"The white zone is for immediate loading and unloading of exotic dancers only."*
---
I don't think your logic tracks.  Nice try, but a racist joke is racist.  Regardless of whether you're "just trying to get a laugh."
---
Adding on to the comment above here, have your newbro miners fit a scram+point on their procurers. When the proteus decloaks and shoots them, have them tackle it back. They’re dead at that point anyways. Meanwhile, have a pilgrim on grid decloak and neut one of them out. Then warp whatever garden variety of BCs/battleships onto them that you like. Your pilgrim needs to be a skilled pilot, and would be safer if accompanied by a scan res damp Arazu with a point to help hold tackle, and scan res for an oneiros or exec to land.
---
Cloaky proteus are one of the squishiest T3Ds...sadly. Unless they are running an unconventional battery+sub+booster fit the pilgrim will cap one or both of them out, no guns no reps. Arazu should buy you 30-60 seconds to warp in help before pilgrim even takes damage. Then just spank em with your dps.
---
None of these ships you should actually take into an abysmal firestorm 😓
---
You still can't AFK though?
---
Yeah, but their applied is pretty shit if you are moving.
---
An AB tengu that isn't webbed will easily perma tank it at 450dps
---

---
I'd wager you don't actually have the standings for real l3 agents.
---
&gt;  after being kicked from PH  (for being away for so long) 
---
Assuming that's the reason you were kicked you can just re-apply to Horde. We don't blacklist you just for inactivity.
---
It sure isn't hard to press f1 occasionally.
---
Stop posting already, just take your loss, you don't know shit about carriers.
---
Yup, sure don't. Clearly carriers are the epitome of difficult engaging gameplay, right!!! Right?!?!
---
...you don't understand how carrier ratting works do you? 
---
It's one of the highest APM activities in the game
---
I'll answer this question as though it reads, "What are the advantages of playing in a team rather than solo?" The advantages are deeper immersion, benefiting from the knowledge and assistance of others, and the feeling the satisfaction that can only come from achieving objectives collectively. EVE is meant to played with others, and experienced players eventually find that their team mates are the primary aspect that keeps EVE fresh and worth playing. Playing solo, after a couple of years you simply run out of interesting things to do.
---
Is it racist?
---
Thanks for the info, it was very helpful!
---
Test server is an interesting idea, but I'd rather keep everything (for lack of a better term) *\*in-universe\*;* guess I'm old-fasioned, or maybe it's the RP'r in me. I've toyed with the idea of using an empty clone though, so I'll give that a shot soon.
---
Based on what I've read, Agents use the highest of the character's standing with themselves/their Corp/their Faction as the base for effective standing. Plus I've  run L2+ Distribution missions for Minmattar corps I have no direct standing with, so I can only imagine that's due to my \~4.0 Minmattar standing.  
---
You've given me a lot of ideas regarding gate-campers. I had actually considered that the low-price Hurricane was a honeypot trap, but I didn't think someone would actually go through the trouble ingame. Guess I was mistaken! Also to be clear, it was just a plain hull, no modules or rigs or anything. The only thing I put on it was an Expanded Cargohold II so I could carry the shuttle I used to fly out there back with me.....forgot about that, loved that shuttle...damn gate-campers...
---
I had completely forgotten about the D-Scanner. I've only used it a couple of times; I'll need to better familiarize myself with it.
---
Overall, it seems the best policies in Low-Sec are maximizing paranoia, preparation, and persistence while minimizing predictability. Makes sense!
---
There's literally NPC on demand system. Pop a calm abyss and be done in a few minutes.
---
You should probably join a real corp, if your keen on staying in snuff, I suggest exop, they are chill dudes
---
this right here ccp
---
Awful advice. You can take a pair of proteus. If the Corp is not good for you, then move on. But if it’s just these two guys you can do it with a little planning and determination.
---
It's not like they are tough. Just pop the rats.
---
If a fleet cant pop a few trigs I dont think it deserves to bash a citadel.
---
Maybe they should use dev time for something that doesn't get immediately disabled.
---
Err... pretty sure Uemon is in the high sec-LXQ corridor. Sure they were there for you? :D
---
Because he probably sucks Joe's dick too good
---
Man, I got excited.
---
I think it was a random encounter, but it definitely a Chase.
---
Mining products in 0.5 systems with a bunch of mining structures on your overview.

this is why you don't complete the tutorials.
---
Only if you want it to be.
---
Much like...everything in the game.
---
But I'm sure you love talking about how high your apm is. Just keep spam clicking to keep your apm up.
---
Yah panfam still selling titans for 75b...lawl
---
Even without spool and with the midrange mid dps ammo it does more dps than a moros with void, then add spook on top of that. Some guy crunched the numbers upthread. And it has better tracking.
---
Holy fuck you actually don't know how carriers work.
---
Buy yourself one, my man. Take it for a spin. Then you'll chat less shit.
---
Why not offer him a bailout? Like “Pay me 10b and you can kill me”.
---
Regular carrier ratting is low APM since you group your fighters and press F1. It's super ratting that's high APM since grouping heavy fighters leads to a ton of DPS loss through reactivation delay.
---
Then why would they appear as available? Unless "available" means something closer to "exists" rather than "available to offer missions", in which case is there a way to filter Agents so only those with actual, offerable missions appear? Plus my effective standings are way above the L3 threshold (~halfway to L4), so they definitely *should* be receptive to me unless I'm completely missing something.
---
You've already spent time answering my questions, but I do have a follow-up regarding storyline Agents. So far I only have encountered Storyline Agents when they reach out to me after finishing 16 L# missions; they've always offered a single mission, usually extremely quick and easy, and they've always been docked in a station. The only time I was ever offered a mission by an out-of-station Agent was toward the end of the SoE Epic Arc.
---
So my question is, how do I get referred to out-of-station Storyline Agents? Is it some kind of prescheduled event (e.g. "Storyline Agents will be available all week in Jita"), part of an Epic Arc, limited to specific corps/factions, or something else? Thanks!
---
No one said they were difficult. They said you cannot afk them, because fighters *require* inputs or they don't do anything. And not input like "hit f1 and fighters will automatically approach and orbit".
---
I agree!
---
But,
---
OP sounds very risk adverse and the CEO seems to not care. If this type of tactic is harassment and all around bad for him, then he should leave the area.
---
Not necessarily. And once you have the skills and a bit of startup capital you can pretty easily plex your account with a Myrmidon and/or a Rattlesnake running C3 sites. (Obviously with isk/hr depending on your own skills and the hole in question, time taken to roll if need-be, etc.) It's just a bit limiting in the early weeks where those support skills you're training arnt really being put to use yet.
---
Been a great time, thanks for the fights everyone
---
Yea as many have said t2 indy isn't great.. If you want to build t1 stuff make ships. They sell for ok.
---
Same dude, nearly getting scramed, while a Phoenix is landing got my heart pounding.

It won't "die completely" for a while but would u like to play a game with 5-10k other players spread all over the map, 30% of whom are bots...

Not believing this till I see (closed) next to snuff, sorry Yonis. Nice wall of text though.

Eve wouldn't have been as fun as it was without you guys. Have fun with whatever you do next

I always keep crawling back to the bitch that is EVE Online so nah not yet
---
Oh shit i just saw that. Whoops

all it did was made the game a chore to play, so people decided not to.

they didn't add a single thing to make them interact more.
---
I’ve been killing Jackdaws as fast as I could but they are flying in packs now.

When they fight back, along with the idiotic NPCs whose lives I’m trying to save, that’s too much dps for a solo Lachesis.

Oh please no 😔
---
Another one bites the dust

What if the botter starts running a second bot to fake leech off the original bot. Making it seem like it's just ruining the life of the original bot.

Its mean they gonna rework the Chaos Era concept

The process will probably length for 8 years and when they gonna finishing their works,  Eve will be dead anyways.
---
haha no worries, just wait a few days and then you can come visit us in Black Rise and get blobbed by our new elite frig gangs

Is your ign Kaye huren by any chance, I know a bloody guy who loves to 'adopt' abandoned drones.

Can I have your snuff?

So 20 thousand people and 10 thousand alts?

Yeah, the raven state issue is the highest possible DPS subcap in the game, and also costs just a bit more than 1tril isk.

"Lagin! Lagin! Lagin!"

im cautiously optimistic, i love seeing that eve is on the up (even if "iTs JuST kRAbS cOmINg BaCK")
---
Eve Vegas needs to really solidfy that Eve has a future in our minds, I don't think an NPE rework and a Triglavian Dread will be enough so hopefully they have something else that isn't already on hoboleaks. I fully understand that they aren't going to be announcing any major gameplay reworks at vegas but giving us a general overview on their plans for the future would be great.
---
I knew we'd both die. I never made an offer.
---
afaik the Mittani knows whats happening in eve so just ask him or wait for the slope
---
Was an absolute pleasure working with you guys as INIT., Good luck to wherever you fly next!
---
Lots of people don't like us, we wouldn't want it any other way.
---
Been out of the loop. What happened between test and frt and what happened to their space?
---
Really the problem is the dplex mechanic, it's zero interaction so very bottable and not fun, so players don't want to do it anyway. This also makes it hard to enforce botting rules, because how do you tell the difference between a bot and a farming player?
---
FW should be all about oplexing and fighting for systems. So there should be no deplexing, but systems should passively deplex at a couple of sites an hour to make sure they only become contested if they're active.
---
Make lowsec great again
---
I am proud, Darwins was the bait for that giga  blap and escalation
---
Last year I became unwell, and I spent a long time in ICU in hospital. The prognosis was extremely negative. I mentioned to a friend in Snuff how I had never seen a titan ingame and he promised to me that I would.
---
On a set day, quite feebly I logged in and travelled to Rakapas, to a Snuff citadel where I was granted docking rights. My friend told me then to undock, and I was eagerly waiting for a pilot to login and eventually be able to see a titan.
---
Instead, all of a sudden, the entire sky filled with titans. So many pilots had logged in to show me their ships and fulfil my dream. They patiently waited whilst I wandered around in my tiny ship, looking at those amazing flying cities, in rapt delight.
---
They also knew I had never seen a Doomsday weapon, so they killed one of their Revelations just to show it to me. Finally, I asked whether I could be killed by the Molok, and they kindly indulged me. I was the happiest pod in Black Rise.
---
Eventually, after 310 days in hospital I was able to return home and, against all odds, I recovered. Now I'm back playing EVE, and Snuff doesn't pass on the opportunity to kill me any chance they get.
---
However, I'll always have a special place in my heart for the kindest guys I have ever met online. 
---
Thank you, Snuff ❤️
---
Most importantly, Adversity is recruiting.
---
Just use a passive rattlesnake. You shouldn't be ratting in a hole you're not fairly sure is safe anyway, so you don't need to be covops.
---
Well... its one way to get into EVE history. Kudos for that. o/
---
Every fucking player interaction now deserves an AAR as rich and interesting as this pile of steaming shitpost

Still sucks to see Snuffed go.

Some of my favorite moments in EE were our constant harassment campaigns between our two alliances.
