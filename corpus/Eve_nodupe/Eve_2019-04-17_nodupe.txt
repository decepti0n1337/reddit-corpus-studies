By the seems of it, you've gotten a very distinctive style and livery and it works very well at catching the eye so I wouldn't change it too much. If you did, a vinyl on the van might work as a solution until you upgrade it to keep costs down.

Implying people in Eve are normal
---
Hi TD5K. The nice thing about reddit is I can give you my honest opinion on your ideas, and you have 0 power to delete it. 
---
From my point of view, one issue you seem to have is you think others have a good reason to want to listen to you, but you think have zero obligation to hear anyone else in return. That's not how life works. You gotta give respect to get it. You have to listen to others before you can be heard. Here's what I have to say to you:
---
Instead of insulting you, I'm going to give you some friendly advice that, if you choose to follow it, could make you a lot better liked. On whether you actually will, I have my reservations, but I would suggest you think about my suggestions, and try following them for say, a week. You've been doing the same exact thing for like a year now: play the game completely alone, and instead of try to counter them, you throw tons of salt and toxicity when people try to mess with you, which, FYI is **completely fair game**. Maybe try something different, and people's attitude toward you would change.
---
The above leads me to my first point. The first thing you need to know about Eve, is that anyone can do absolutely anything they want (as long as it's kept in the game, of course). If people are messing with you, you need to A. learn to counter them (more on this below) and B. learn to be a good sport about it. Learn to laugh at them and yourself, and respect other people's free will. anking is perfectly allowed in Eve, and barring CCP's acquisition by Disney, nothing will ever change that. You can eithere 1. accept it and modify your gameplay 2. find a different game to play, where griefing isn't allowed, or 3. continue to throw hissy fits on your stream, which will lead to continued interest in screwing with you.
---
The second thing you need to know about Eve is that it's a social game. Pretty much everything you can do in Eve, you need friends to do it really well. Like many other people, I find the way you play Eve to be strange. Like, really really bizarre. Why don't you try making friends? You might as well be playing a singleplayer game if you're playing Eve the way you do. 
---
To fix this, You need to stop trying to play the game alone and make some friends. Make a new character and join a new player corporation like Pandemic Horde. They'll help you make money and shit. On top of that, they'll teach you enough so that you actually sound like you have a clue what you're talking about when you talk about the game. Right now, **it's immediately obvious from the instant you open your mouth that you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about**. People don't like somebody who thinks they know what they're talking about but don't. That's half the reason you've been griefed.
---
In fact, I myself, despite all the anger you keep expressing against the community, have offered to be friends with you not once but **several times** in an effort to try to show you the ropes and help you be a better player. But you've constantly refused. In fairness to you, maybe it's because the first time you've been fucked with that's how the people that hit you made their approach to you (yes, I've seen that video). But, I actually **sent you 500M ISK previously** as proof that my offer was genuine (ask yourself, did anyone fucking with you ever send you ISK?). And what did you do? You blocked me. I can't think of anything more stupid.
---
If you're willing to have a one-on-one chat, in total honesty and confidentiality, hit me up here on reddit. I will offer you **1B ISK** if you chat with me for 15 minutes on your Discord and listen with an open ear to what I'm telling you. I will offer you **10b ISK** if you'll agree to play the game according to my advice for two weeks, at the end of two weeks, and regardless of whether things work out like I promise. That's 11B total.
---
**TLDR: Quit acting like such an angry dickhead, accept that Eve is like the wild west and nobody is ever safe, find yourself some friends, and you'll enjoy Eve a lot more. Or, go find a single-player game to play, because a single-player game Eve definitely is not.**
---
Good luck.

---
I think I'm not talking about whether you communicated inappropriately with your peers. I'm talking about, specifically, your feckless cries of harrassment which are rather disappointing. No one is harassing you here, they are embarrassing you. There's a difference.
---
The simple fact is that you did do something inappropriate. Like I've said, I dont know what it is, and I dont really care. Something happened and some people got banned, at least one of them permanently. It is done.
---
Now, ask me how many times I've seen this episode, the one where the guy who got banned from a video game cried out to the heavens and anyone who will listen for fairness. They couldn't possibly be at fault! Where's the proof? Please. So predictable. Such pitiable behavior, especially from an accomplished professional - a fact we would not know had you not thrown it out there.

A few tips from my experience soloing in lowsec:
---
\-Learn to d-scan good
---
\-If you're going to brawl in lowsec in anything smaller than a cruiser bring either an afterburner or dual web
---
\-If you're going to kite in lowsec don't warp into an outpost when there's already someone inside because you'll land on top of them and they'll web you
---
\-When buying ships buy 3-10 of a few different kinds and use [https://red-frog.org/](https://red-frog.org/) to ship them to a highsec system bordering lowsec with a 3rd or 4th tier market hub. I use Stacmon for example; Jufvitte is also good if you're a Gallente resident like me.
---
\-Use a local checker tool, here are a few:  [https://localthreat.xyz/](https://localthreat.xyz/) ,  [https://www.eveovermind.com/combatrecon.php](https://www.eveovermind.com/combatrecon.php) ,  [http://eve-plh.com/#/home](http://eve-plh.com/#/home) (Don't worry, they don't break eula)
---
\-Set standing to orange or red on dangerous alliances and corps in game. Don't fight people who blob incessantly. If you do fight them use something fast, preferably 3000m/s+ and separate them
---
\-Watch a shitload of videos:

I can't see, your salt splashed in my eye

I'd like to request a version with the garbled NPC comms chatter, please!
---
Thinking of getting into Guardians - aside from the skills are there recommended implants or boosters I should be looking at?

I'm referring to some random character with CCP in it somewhere that shows up first.

---
The way that it has worked for everybody else for the last 15 years is that the mouse sensitivity matches the system mouse sensitivity which is already set correctly. There's never been a need for a setting. You ought to be wondering—*"what makes my system different that the sensitivity is effectively multiplied when I run the game?"*—and that is what I hope the devs will help you determine.
---
He did make an apology at one point, I saw the thread. If you look through his history now, it has been deleted. I have seen nothing that discredits the original audio clip, especially what he said. It's entirely possible that I've made a mistake, but I very much doubt it. Unless somebody Chuck audio from different sources to make him say the sentences that he did, there is no context where what he said was okay.
---
Those faction modules make you more of a target than a base fit with 2x LSE, 2x adaptives, and maybe an EM hardener with T2 damage control and bulkheads.
---
I would say shame on you, but 99% of people only read click bait type headlines.
---
For an Orcawith an average tank fit, the number of ships needed to kill it in highsec isn't worth it.  
---
For this thing, they would protect go out of their way for the challenge and to get it on the killboard.
---
Just let James 315 know, I'm sure he will be willing to help you test it's tank. Or you can go on Sisi with some corp mates, try it in working conditions, see what works best for you. Every tank is breakable, it's just a matter of numbers. Run there's a DPS tool that some streamers are using. Just extrapolate data for bigger threats.
---
you can switch back to the old map in settings btw

---
Where to do sign up fo this?
---
Be aware that fitting more expensive modules makes you more of a target for the enemy. There's a fine line between that. Use T2 Modules and replace the Adaptive with another EM Ward. Train for T2 Shield Command Burst and get the Shield Mindlink Implant. Just use T2 Bulkhead and Damage Control. 
---
You're missing a lot of EHP if you don't want to change the rigs, but that's up to you! This is the point where you draw the line and that's fine. Different players draw it at different spots.
---
I'm mad at you too. I mean it's the 4.20 fleet on 4.20 lmao

I have never felt more ugly than that one time I flew a Catalyst. *shudders*

WHY IS ITS HULL SPLIT LIKE THAT AGH
---
&gt;Incursus
---
It's got a little spear and it's gonna stab people :3 o shit enyo gang RUN
---
&gt;Imicus
---
One of my past corporations had a semi-policy of killing people and then trying to recruit them as members.
---
I rejected anyone who flew an Imicus. 
---
The hull is fucking ***bent***. That ship is why Gallente ship designs just feel ***wrong.*** That ship is so bad that I feel bad for the Exequeror and it's '70s car + '70s SciFi look, for being associated with it. That ship is everything that is wrong with EVE. Even if you were to straighten it out and give it a second kickstand it would just look kinda silly at that point. That ship is so wack that it even makes me forget that the Heron is also asymmetrical. The only thing in EVE that has ever infuriated me more than the hull design of the Imicus is \~\~humans\~\~ *whatever you are* who run 4 Warp Core Stabs on their Asteros, and even for them I still have an answer.
---
But there's no saving the Imicus, the Helios, the pilots who fly them, and their wee little dog too.

---
This stuff just doesn't happen anymore lol.
---
thanks for sharing your experience in such detail. how much dps increase does it feel like the assault bs has vs the vanguard?
---
Is get rid of the third rig go for reinforced bulk head. Tech 2 mods and grab a drone navigation computer.  Your biggest source of ehp is your hull.    Increasing your drone speed will help your miners travel faster to and from with cuts down on time waste.  More likely to have drones gambled/smart bombed then to be ganked in hs orca.  That said never mine at war or with a active kill right.   Even a lower dose ship can solo a orca once tackled.  So considered a flight of ec_300s if you're in a particularly dangerous area.  As long as your over 350k ehp your about as safe from gankers as can be.  But remember if someone wants you dead.  There is always a way.  So gotta balance cost/ efficiency
---
I'm a terrible fleet member, but sometimes I wait a minute to watch and hear all the Pew pews of my fleeties jumping through the gate
---
Do i need to have it enabled in the audio settings somewhere? I have been mining and ratting for years and have not heard it even once. (or then im just tone deaf idk)
---
It’s not about being careful really, its about being gullible. I was gullible enough to fall for that shit.
---
I was with you guys, goons for a while... There’s one motherfucker that was selling 500plex for 1.8bil, yet it was something like 18bil or some shit, the game is full of scum, you just gotta keep in mind if it’s too good to be true, it probably is...
---
come to the top belt in Tama. You'll get to see some shit.

---
Look at all that learning you didn't know you were getting!!
---
Corp hangars, personal storage, no fear of being locked out, free repair via tether, the ability to add the services you want/need the most.
---
I'm... shocked. Honestly.  
---
You're either not reading my question correctly, or... well I don't know what to say.  
---
If I move the mouse one pixel; how much would that be in camera rotation?  
---
0.1 radians? 1 radians?... 2 radians?  
---
There's no exact maths here, it's a matter of user preference.
---
Just about every game on the market has a camera rotation sensitivity option.  
---
Look at any FPS, or third person adventure game.  
---
Heck! Even console games have options for it.
---
But thank you!  
---
You've managed to not only turn me away from EVE Online, but also from this whole community.
---
Kicked themselves out. CEO had enough of goons or something.
---
It happens more and more cause you are using the same fit, over and over, maybe? They are checking your zkill and know what you are flying maybe?
---
So free tether is cheaper than fuel?  (Narrator voice:  No fuel is definitely way more  costly...)
---
All of that stuff can be done in an NPC station.  
---
The only thing is that it’s yours.
---
You could just fly around in corvettes too if you really wanted to.
---
Do this during Burn Jita next year
---
Not even close to the same analogy.
---
Bait it as a Freeport and then flip standings 9 months down the road when people get comfortable going there.  Then as chaos ensues, suicide gank the shiny stuff.
---
Batphone PIRAT for extra lulz
---
I did nothing inappropriate and I hope you will be man enough to recognize you were wrong when the full facts come to like.
---
Follow your own advice.
---
Jita was chosen as the trade hub due to the high number of connections and easy access to the majority of the game.  
---
  
---
trade hubs kinda have died down a bit because theres no incentive to have a local tradehub when long distance logistics is so easy for the line members. (this is not to say logistics in eve isn't fucking aids, its just pointing out that most groups worth their salt have a delivery service)  
---
rens? hek? dodixie? fuck em. only like 1 more mid to get to jita in a jf route. This could be a reason why they have deteriorated as regional trade hubs over the years
---
You will have the account, but just like coming back after a long hiatus, it'll be in alpha state and all the omega-only skills will be disabled. The SP will still be invested, though, so you are free to sub it and/or Plex it to access all the neat skills you bought it for.
---
I had a blast with everyone in Bombers Bar this weekend, thanks Tempelman! Also special thanks to our hunters, you’re awesome!
---
Oh interesting.
---
Tools like Pirates Little Helper are pretty helpful in giving you a ballpark estimate of who's with who in local though some think it's a bit of a crutch.
---
Jita is pretty central to the map, so it's a decent distance from just about anywhere.
---
Amarr is the 2nd best hub b/c it's got most everything Jita has, and you can have a conversation in Local.
---
Dodixie used to be decent, but I haven't been there in years.
---
Rens / Hek are in Minnie space, who cares about those guys. =)
---
sisi, if you're speakung of 1v1s
---
I don't have a problem with accepting when I am wrong. Stop projecting.
---
Would honestly say fit a bunch of ships you don't mind losing, record your fight (obs is great for this), watch the footage back and you'll maybe spot mistakes you made and how the enemy moved etc. Speak to the people who kill you and be genuine and kind, generally more often than not people in eve are willing to help you improve and will give you pointers and I.
---
It takes about a week for GSF members to get our Alt-Corps into the Alliance, I think you renters can live with a couple of days wait.

A lot of the good subcap balance changes in recent time were pushed by the more competent CSM memebers i.e. Suitonia.

They removed the in-game browser? I recently got back into the game (last played a few years ago) and I thought that a browser existed but didn't know for sure, thought it could be the Mandela Effect hahaha. At least the steam overlay has a browser...
---
Guardians are almost always used with a cap chain. Unless you're planning to be the first Guardian pilot in your corp, I guarantee someone has a doctrine fit you should be using. That said, the current fits may all go out the window when Savior implants become available.
---
Okay Grandpa got any more stories of the old times.
---
Yes. Can you be... more specific?
---
I didn’t come to this thread expecting to find a real answer. This is a good one.
---
Dodixie is where I started out my eve career last year in my high sec days. I was able to buy just about anything I needed, but the prices were usually noticeably worse than dodixie and amarr. Amarr is where most wormholers have their death clone, because Amarr is in the center of wormhole space is what I heard at some point, so it’s more likely to have a connection closer to Amarr than to jita.
---
You cannot hold tether in an NPC station.  Free repairs are not the only reason to be tethered.  
---
You cannot add services you want/need to a station.  
---
Corp hangars cost ISK in a station.
---
You can gun a citadel and fight war targets from the gunners seat.
---
You can get better refine rates from a citadel than an NPC station.
---
You can get better research rates from a citadel than an NPC station.
---
You can get better manufacturing results from a citadel than an NPC station.
---
Need I go on?
---
0 timer cloning. Cheaper manufacturing. In a high traffic system, corp hangars are often more expensive than the fuel. Also, not all systems even have a station.
---
Despite common thought, Poitot isn't the trade hub of Syndicate.
---
It is however the only named system in Syndicate.
---
 Because its dying just like rens
---
Im camping their systems mostly by myself. They hardly ever rat/mine.
---
Ive been doing it for a week now, got some good frags, more to come.

Bastion are great

You're crying to the wrong guy. You've been ringing my snowflake-alarm bells since last week, but I decided to let it unfold naturally. Your passive-aggressive meltdown is entirely familiar. If you hadn't quit over this you would have quit over the next inconvenience, and believe me, EVE is full of them. in4b can i haz ur stuff
---
There are a lot of casual corps out there that are perfectly fine with members that come and go or that don't want to join voice comms. It's pretty common in my experience for people to want the benefits of working together, without wanting to make any kind of commitment to the game.
---
&gt; I recommend Horde, Test, Goons, Brave and Eve Uni

He wants to avoid PvP. Especially when he won't be starting it.
---
Yeah I’m keeping the character! Was crazy I just randomly decided to browse the character bazaar and came across my very first ceo from my first corporation that I joined and he was selling his character. So I grabbed it lol
---
Neut spawns, full freagin spawns of nothing but neuting ships and occasional Pocket Disconnected
---
How much time ya got?
---
Yep, just like I thought.
---
The great contribution of "because it is."
---
This too, I don't die on them though but end up with like 1-2 min spare instead of usual 5-6.
---
Tell Tyrion to hang the anime at half mass for this disappointment
---
Could you make it 1.5 hours so I don’t have to keep restarting?
---
all two of them?
---
&gt;And I've heard rumors they constantly tweak the spawns which you cannot test on sisi since abyssals are disabled there.
---
They were disabled for a while, then enabled, then disabled for a little bit again, apparently now they're on again. So it goes back and forth.
---
you know you can make money outside of afk vnis right?
---
Jita is your walmart supercenter. Amarr is your local regional shipping center. Dodixie is that mom and pop owned general store in the tiny town you grew up in. Hek/rens is like buying shit out of some guys trench coat in a back alley.
---
Right click.

After friendly leaving BL, we moved to lowsec. we built our own fleet and got a few merc contracts in Genesis and Detorid.  so much fun during the last 6 months, made a lot of good friends here and enjoyed it. 
---
Though the corp grows faster and the fleet scale increases a lot, we never forget the core of our hobby: small gang pvp.
---
勿忘初心. thanks to Elo, and his advice "learn and practice".
---
Its worth it to try playing the game with newbie alliances (like Horde)  
---
Solo Alpha play /w no intention to PVP is gonna be a pretty steep mountain to climb.

What about those of us with an actual degree in marketing?  Can they call you a dumbass?  Because they probably will, and here is why:
---
GSF is renting space that is actually usable.  NC. is renting space that has no ihubs.  Which of these seems to be a better deal, price not withstanding?  I would venture the GSF space.  However, the NC. space is more expensive, even though it is currently worthless.  How is that for Marketing 101?
---
&gt;or any other.
---
you should visit Hek.
---
Nah, hek and rens is the haji shop. You get deployed to a shit hole and gotta make do with what you can scrounge together from the haji shop to make shit work..
---
I don't know, I don't watch Trek Wars.
---
I love the map, sometimes I just get absorbed looking at how things connect and reading the descriptions of the regions. But to get more useful info from it, click the gear in the top left corner to change what is being displayed. I find "# of ships destroyed in the last 1hr" helpful, same with 24hr, Security Status is helpful for seeing highsec vs lowsec vs nullsec, you can also see where you've been.
---
It's also super helpful to get good at zooming and rotating. A lot of the systems fit together in a very funky way and with out getting a decent view it's hard to make sense of it.
---
I still have no idea what that rainbow bridge is, it jumps right out at you when looking at the map. I forget exactly what two systems it connects.
---
I think a lot of people who are good at PVP will say only one thing: Experience. Obviously there are things you can do to perform better in PVP, such as using your hotkeys to activate/overheat modules, maintaining transversal, using a good fit ,etc. But ultimately, imo those are things that can only help you once you've got enough experience. Another thing I'm still trying to get better at is not to yolo in every time. Playing a little more risk averse teaches me when to GTFO and reduces my losses which allows me to pvp more in the long run. 
---
On the note of being a little more risk averse, I don't fly those 2 bil ships as much any more. Sure it's a shame it's just gathering dust in the hangar, but I'm trying to limit myself to get better at using 10 mil ships and getting kills with them until I start using expensive ships. 
---
Also it helps to have friends. It's very hard to find solo fights nowadays and I'm okay with that. I just adapt. Even when I fly solo I'll use my alt to scout in an inty or something.
---
One video I think is really good in teaching transversal: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz5rcyoW7DQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz5rcyoW7DQ) It's hard to remember to do it every fight but I've found myself not just straight burning at the enemy anymore and it's nice not getting volleyed off by long range ships in my frigate like a noob anymore :D
---
When was this filled?
---
I need an old video of this, I swore they were different to now!
---
send me 10b isk for escrow and I'll vouch
---
Depends...
---
VNI ratting is mostly afk, anything after that aside from mining is not.
---
Escalations are an option, but can be hit or miss. If you have a decent stream of them available for purchase then the money usually averages to be pretty good.
---
Rattlesnake ratting is probably the most direct next point for combat income. Combat skills are pretty important here despite the fact that you can sit it with pretty low effort.
---
After that is basically carriers then supers.
---
Go with whatever is fun for you because if you're not scaling VNI alts or rorqs, you've got to actually play the game, so pick something interesting and settle in.
---
there is something called the 'tactical overlay', it will help you not lose 'depth' in an engagement.

And you're not going to be double clicking, you'll be million clicking.  Like a never ending stream of clicks to constantly control your direction like you're thinking with traditional WASD movements.

with the right skills you can 0.01 ISK in Jita while sitting mining in a 0.5 belt. thats true highseccing.

You not only wrote a long ass post that I’m not interested in reading as streaming is about the gamer not its followers, the same way social media is to keep contacts,  to require them each time to play games. You are not only an SJW that isn’t red pilled or based but an SJW that needs friends to play eve. Good luck with that. Don’t come to my stream with your friends looking for content. You are not appreciated breaking both terms of service and community guidelines each time you come. To the left any bad action is exploitable and venerable where they feel helpless and require each other thanks to unmet needs through either religion and possibly education. To the right unfortunately it has everything plus more of what’s good where that pride of playing games alone isn’t something that is given up easily yet SJW wants to take your food and share it too. 
---
Good luck with that, you are much way out of your boundaries of what doing a right thing is, for some people gaming is perhaps more important than friends sharing that, doesn’t help the fact that inside you got no pride, or cell membrane expected totally that I would appreciate possible words that are going against my gamer code of conduct as the  as the total qualities between real chads and cyber virgins.

Good luck with that and your friends.

At this point be in goons and get vouched.

---
*Solo* only defines your position buddy. No where in the game outside of can flipping high sec miners can you get a 1v1
---
That being said I’ve seen MarkJ2 solo half of HK before in a Phantasm. Anything is possible.
---
If you’re interested in soloing you need to master the art of Nano. First and foremost. I would also suggest anti-tackle ships. As their main function is to peel tackle off your fleet.
---
I strongly suggest fucking with the Osprey Navy Issue and the Orthrus. Orthrus can rock a 30km scram and will make mince meat of anything that can tackle you. Osprey navy can bring neuts and is fast as fuck and has so many mids you can buffer and auxiliary boost.
---
Also fuck with a Typhoon! Great solo battleship.
---
Why do you want to?
---
As a side note, I've been doing some guristas anomalies recently and I've only ever gotten 4/10 escalations, not sure if that was a typo or whatever
---
do they drop anything
---
The escalations don't seem to be consistent across the different factions I've noticed after looking into it more.
---
I'd do it.  Depends on the situation, but yeah.

Many years ago I lost a charon while drunk. I don't mean it got destroyed, I mean I literally couldn't find it. It was  a corp asset at the time so I undertook a massive audit to find what I did with it but found nothing. I believe space gnomes took it.
---
Amarr is also physically placed between Jita and the extremely populated southern regions of the game, while being a fairly short gate route to Jita. Easy to bring stuff into to keep prices competitive, while also lopping off a few more JF jumps than the other hubs.
---
And people exporting from goonspace can offload their stuff in amarr for greater profit, keeping it well stocked.
---
Maybe init should just stop using CSM info and then if they're really lucky, their blues might like them
---
You can sell blue WH loot in main station to npcs in Amarr.
---
It doesn't say anywhere in that, can you even call it an, AAR, that the Structure was secured. It simply states the  "timer ticked closer to zero".

Where does it say they had secured it? Or did you not even read your own AAR, you fucking spastic...

Jesus fuck, if you're going to argue and least get your story straight first you absolute cretin.

Hull timer Fortizar against Snuffed (which never showed up afaik.) Understandable when you compare their size to the defender's formup. I believe Horde, and I'd imagine the other PanFam duders as well, were supposed to 3rd party. Had a brawl before Goons + TEST came to defend as well, but I don't think they ever made it into the main system before the attackers left. Defenders did a good job holding the main system as well, from what I've heard.
---
No i love the sarcastic popups
---
Welcome to EVE?
---
Let me say I have no god in this race. I have no clue who this dude is over than posts on EVE.
---
This is just strange. Why are people so fascinated with this dude? He broke an NDA and did some shit against the EULA, according to CCP. I'm inclined to believe CCP, because I don't think they have anything to gain by lying about it.
---
But shit like this? Going through two years of chat logs? Dear god why? The dude is already permabanned from a video game, who does this serve?
---
I understand harassing CCP for evidence but anything past that is just fucking strange.
---
And she did? Because if so i would hope shes your wife by now
---
why would you ever want to see retards avatars
---
there are several on twitch
---
for a while there i had shield alert as my phone's notification/alarm noise because it was the only thing that would wake me up
---
&gt; But shit like this? Going through two years of chat logs? Dear god why? The dude is already permabanned from a video game, who does this serve?
---
Brisc himself is currently making a campaign out of his ban, and eve is the hallmark channel of MMOs.
---
Open corp recurtment tool in game. Filter it to over 1000 members and you will see the 5 big new bro corps.
---
What system? We need to know so we can test it for you.
---
So what? This is between Brisc (who comes off like a narcissist) and CCP (who should have released evidence when prompted).
---
**yawn**
---
Y'all chill, I'm not the fuckin darkness social media manager, I'm just someone playing the game and had a good time defending the fortizar (and succeeding ;) ) and managed to get a screenshot, you salty mfers.
---
Family Values politician was only bullshitting for votes - rest of today's shocking news after these messages.
---
He was a public representative via the CSM, and has been [engaging in tit-for-tat madposting ever since his ban, right here on the reddit peanut gallery](https://www.reddit.com/user/deltaxi65/). Brisc has chosen to keep digging, publicly, and there's plenty of people happy to hand him shovels.
---
Nobody else does.
---
Ibis best ship obviously.
---
And you're serving only to enable him by continuing to give him a platform.
---
If he has any grounds for an unban, no one has any power in that fight but CCP. I can only speculate as to why CCP hasn't released any evidence, but if I had to guess it's because their only evidence would reveal internal workings of the CSM or CCP that the playerbase isn't currently privy to.
---
Because 'Grr Gon Hat Gon"
---
Not sure why entities within ncdock continue to perpetuate false news that lack real evidence against this Brisc character?
---
1. create an alt
---
2. inject about 3-4m SP.
---
3. join FW
---
4. Explode a lot in T1 frigates and try to learn from others
---
You can skip step 1 and 2 if you have a combat pilot already you can use.
---
Especially after CCP removed literally all risk from PLEX.
---
Nothing wrong with nipple piercings!
---
Do yourself a favor and join test. They are better than darkness
---
Clone storage and hopping. Running an astrahus for each clone might be annoying, but better than waiting 2/3 of a day every time you want to switch specialized activities, roll boosters, or jump into an empty clone without risking a specialized one in someone else's station. Fuel costs could go up by an order of magnitude and it would still be better than being stuck with the old jump clone system.
---
Welcome to r/eve man :D
---
PH's Fc said we did not need potato mode, ow boy was that false. This was a fun brawl even at 10 FPS, saved at least a few ships in my little kirin. We were heavily outgunned and outmanned but FC got us out with a pretty even BR. Had fun, would fight darkness on their home turf again.
---
&gt;And you're serving only to enable him by continuing to give him a platform.
---
yes, because drama is one of eve's great traditions. 
---
Regarding CCP not releasing anything, Team Security will never disclose any of their evidence or information because it undermines their ability to do their jobs. the CSM NDA very clearly states that CCP can terminate you at will, for any reason, with no legal repercussions (within the bounds of law obviously). 
---
so TLDR, CCP has no reason at all to produce a single shred of evidence.
---
it's a little wrong when you want them on 13 year olds tho
---
Great leaks

As long as you are smart about it, 200k should be fine. As always keep an eye on local, maybe preload Concord, and don't sit on the warp in points.
---
Nice work
---
It was def a fun brawl, I lost a thrasher (still super new and gotta train stuff up) and almost shit myself at one point bc I got lost when trying to catch up and beamed STRAIGHT into PH ships lmao. GG, I hope it's not on home turf again, but yea man gg
---
Thank you, I adore this game endlessly and I hope I'm able to stick with it for even more time
---
Dear TD5K,
---
Thank you for your long ass wall of text reply, which unlike mine, is incoherent and truly not worth reading, just like the rest of the shit you spew on reddit and twitch. You didn't do well in school, and it shows.
---
&gt; You are not appreciated breaking both terms of service and community guidelines each time you come.
---
Sorry, but while stream sniping **might** be against Twitch's rules, it is most definitely **not** against Eve's rules to shoot a pilot who **just happens** to be running a stream. **Think about it, dipshit**, if that was the case, every highsec carebear and his dog would do like you and run a Twitch stream while they mine, and consider that their safety card.
---
TD5K, you are a toxic, unintelligent fuck who has absolutely no business playing Eve. Given that you've slapped away my outstretched hand of friendship, I will until you change your mind, follow you and shoot at you until the servers go dark. Or you quit.  I will use **Locator Agents** to find you. Google them, they are a mechanic installed by CCP for the **express purpose** of people like me being able to go after after stupids like you.
---
TD5K, if your brave enough and God bestows a miracle by blessing you with some functioning brain cells, enough that you decide to think about what I've said, my hand of friendship will be extended, if you're brave enough to offer yours. Until then, I consider you a coward, and my friends WILL hunt you the fuck down.
---
**TLDR: You're a fucktard and a spineless pussy, and until you fix your attitude then I will hunt you down, motherfucker!**

"Whenever I need to link a system now I use three extra steps to do so!"
---
Fried chicken beer?
---
I’ll give you my advice as a new player, as the vets have stuck to stuff since they started.
---
I saw the first few posts, they suggest FW. Don’t bother with FW, as you will encounter 3 types of people.
---
1- Bots
---
2- Veteran alts
---
3- no people
---
I was suggested the same thing, I stuck around FW for about 2 days and got into about 4-5 fights.
---
How did I learn to pvp? I’m by no means good at pvp, but I have an idea of each encounter. I’ve been in my corporation’s standing fleet for about a month, I’ve fought all kinds of ships, I’ve gate camped solo.
---
So my advice is, join a Corp, stay in standing fleet, fight shit and listen to people. You will eventually learn about each encounter and then you will get the hang of solo pvp..
---
Drama is one thing, but you know that this will affect him IRL... never mind the fact that this is completely unnecessary. Yeah, he was dumb enough to link his in game self to his out of game self, but there's no need to crucify the guy. You're really showing how much of a slimy person you are IRL with this post.
---
"enabling him by giving him a platform"  
---
What the fuck did you just say?
---
honestly really cool fights, great video man.
---
TBH this is some of the juiciest drama in a long time.
---
It's gonna take weeks before this one is squeezed dry, ; woohoo!
---
Only one of our newBeans Crucifiers made it out alive, what a hero. Sounds like you did well, will look forward to seeing you in a Megathron next time we meet.
---
I've said far far worse than that.

Daily even.

scream on him too

I did :/

Is this more awkward than choosing VIOLENT_ORGASM as your username?

If you own a super and cant figure out how to fit it properly you probably shouldn't own a super. That being said, where do you rat?

no

I heard it was 2 10" penises

We all had a pretty good giggle at you guys smart bombing all your own crucifiers lol
---
Died to piss poor pilot performance.
---
Was a starving/tangling leshak group in the shipyard room.
---
Got the same spawn later and killed it in the same ship, so it wasn't the spawns fault, just mine.
---
Test and Goons didnt make it to the main engagment in time, so was pretty even sub cap numbers with NC/PH having slightly more. They deagressed once we boated carrier fighters from the fort to the gate, then we all chased them around Fade for a while
---
this post was removed by the tama ratting cabal
---
Dont do testing in M-O. 
---
M-O is for combat. Pure, undocking = consenting,  unadulterated combat.
---
I'm testing a combat fit, where else am I supposed to test that?
---
Came here to post this. Already top comment. Lol.
---
When/what you want test? I got the next two days off work.
---
miss you too
---
WTF you going on about with me for? Did I SAY I needed to do testing presently?
---
Find a willing participant and go one system over. All combat is by consent only, except in M-O. If you dont want big boy toys, go to the next system over. Grab someone from your corp to help if needed. That's what I do
---
I ALMOST lost a gila to downtime. I blitzed the whole site (not looting) and withdrew drones, got out with like 3 seconds mid tunnel.
---
DONT withdraw drones if youre running out of time, it's not worth it. 
---
Check the clock before each site, guys.
---
We role-play as space chickens but idk if that's what you are looking for
---
CCP clearly nit playing the game, changing such a key feature without announcing it and without fixing it.... for weeks now.
---
Most random highsec Corp hangars cost 10k isk so it's not at all unique to citadels.
---
Spai...
---
DID SOMEONE SAY WEED AND BONG HITS
---
Join a WH or small gang corp.
---
Trade hubs have also consolidated since citadels were introduced. Having lived in Ollettiers and Ignoitton for a good while before and after citadels were introduced, they shifted logistics and traffic patterns around within the first few months. 
---
You could probably even see the shift if you look at the losses in Rancer on ZKB. As time passed and more and more citadels were propped up to create highways traffic between Dodixie, Rens and Hek to/from Jits all dropped off.
---
It’s not just about how many mids but the station geometry in those systems and the size of the docking rings. Citadels eliminated that worry. Suddenly you could put your midpoint stations wherever you wanted them, aligned to whatever gate you wanted, keep reds and neuts from docking.
---
I know from personal experience that this alone made it easier for smaller groups to cheaply run more efficient logistics trains that only the larger groups could regularly run previously.
---
Those damn Rooskies are after our precious bodily fluids!
---
I enjoyed my time in Red vs. Blue when I first started playing. Lots of t1 frigates blown up and great fun. I just started playing again after a 7 year break so I can say what it is like now but they appear to still be around. Great place to learn the basics for cheap isk.  [https://rvbeve.com/forums/index.php?/portal/](https://rvbeve.com/forums/index.php?/portal/)
---
Depends, what side are you looking for? Some of the most active would be in the Amarr/Minmatar side but even on the Cal/Gal I could probably find at least one for you.
---
I think there's a historical reason behind jita being the biggest trade hub... wasn't it host to more level 4 missions than any other caldari system so runners ran from there? Then, of course, sold their goods there and infrastructure sprang up around it etc... once they removed the mission runners and gave jita it's own slice of server load it was already too late for it to die of natural causes because it had reached a critical mass.
---
Its a trap!!!
---
I was leaning Amarr, because of the Paladin / Knight theme as thats usually the fantasy class I play.
---
You are most certainly looking for PIE.

Seriously though, I can't believe he thinks these leaks are A.) relevant B.) who gives a fuck C.) pretty tame D.) does your whole alliance know you're a fucking snitch @ u/VIOLENT_ORGASMS
---
Posting shitty leaks to be "#first" is so fucking cringeworthy... even for this sub. Well done you fucking weirdo.
---
?
---
Crawl back under the rock in Querious that you came from, you mong. Your posting blows.
---
Alright partner, you have to understand one thing right out of the gate:
---
If you go out solo and a gang catches you, that IS solo pvp.  There is not a place in New Eden where you will find a population of pilots who only fly solo.
---
As you decrease the numbers of a fleet, the remaining members must become smarter in order to survive and win.  As a solo pvp pilot, you are choosing to be a fleet of 1, and that means that you have to be smarter than every member of every fleet that is operating in your territory.
---
The first fight with a small gang as a solo pilot happens before you ever see each other on grid.  The way you beat them is by not letting them catch you.  One of the ways they beat you is by displacing you from a system or forcing you to dock up.
---
When you cant fight a gang, pester them.  Primary local chat, encroach on their grid and cause them to stall, chase you or whatever.  String them out, take potshots.  Do not get caught, but make yourself a nuisance.  If you make a gang frustrated or unhappy that's a victory even if you don't get a killmail.
---
Oh, and make bookmatks in your favourite systems.  Lots of them.  Above and below gates, around stations, at the sun... anywhere you expect a fight might possibly happen someday.  There is nothing more irritating than a local that can bounce around 20 locations on the same grid.
---
PIE, inc. of the Alliance,  Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris. We're small, but that's what you're going to find for a dedicated RP group. We fly only Amarr ships, no drugs, no pirate implants, only Amarrian skins, and roleplay heavily.
---
If you want to check us out before joining, I do public fleets every Friday night late US TZ. You don't need to be in the militia to join, you just have to shoot at the right targets.
---
Your territory? DARKNESS is a tributary alliance to the Imperium. It stopped being yours once you lost the war and started paying rent to your Goon overlords.
---
Quick lesson: the landlord owns the territory, the tennant pays the rent. It's your landlord's territory. 🐝
---
Wait, so these logs could have been doctored to literally say anything?  What's the point if that's the case?
---
There was a good post stating that Hek is the Jita of the South.   3 regions accessable LvL 4 and 5 Missions galore.  Even mining in system.    Just people tend not to care over Minny space or it's pushed as newbie central.
---
TOO BIG TO FAIL

Then sell it direct to your corpmate... !

Shitty attitude = shitty brain = shitty at pvp

Hi Exooki,
---
Could you list the time timestamp(s) where you see the error? I'll take a look at the raw video and see if I can find anything on that end.
---
free money that comes of people paying taxes for the services they use in your citadel, but keep in mind that there are already competition and the bigger your structure is the more attention it will attract.
---
Then why are they so hostile when i'm over there?
---
Top belt?
---
Pretty sound advice tbh- tho after I made this post me and I friend went and camped Novice Plexes and had some fun... we only lost 1 fight(We had had a few 2v2 fights, but this one... we almost had it but the enemy managed to beat us)
---
The recruitment process can be quite long. I contracted my belongings and paid a 2 billion isk security deposit to a recruiter back 2014, and I still haven't been contacted regarding the status of my application.
---
I enjoy these vids. You should make them longer. Good job.

What part of having a structure did you not understand? The part where you own it and not someone else?
---
Awesome, thanks. I will be in contact shortly.
---
In your linked BR, note the times that the Little Red Riding Hole ships died, and their location, compared to the NREM deaths and location. RE-HO died on the C3 at 03:24-03:30 evetime. Our (NREM) first death did not occur until 04:11, almost 50 minutes later up on the C5 static. We were not in fleet nor allied with RE-HO, so your attempt to skew the numbers back in your favor with an inaccurate zkill br is odd, to say the least.
---
Man,I'd forgotten above that.. buzzing between belts hitting d-scan and praying for a big payout..
---
I like the sound man. Just like the good old c 64 days. :)
---
It's not what you say, it's who listens.
---
That would be a good reason for pitchforks.

All of the fights in Abyssal PvP are 1v1.
---
You basically have to give another guy $10.

you seem mad but just to clarify, these aren't my leaks - an ex corp member of brisc's dumped them to a whole bunch of people, I just wanted to do some bear baiting

How often do you find these sites? can they be run consistently?

the reason why lowsec is dead is because the game is 16 years old. When it first came out there was a bunch of content in lowsec. People ratting, people sitting in belts mining, catching people traveling, etc. 
---
There wasn't dreads sitting on gates camping and every other person didnt have a carrier/super multi boxed waiting to drop on you for attacking their precious alt.
---
Now people are very risk averse / know better than to sit in a belt mining in low sec. Majority of people know that numbers win and there are rarely people fighting solo except for a few outliers. There was also a lot less bots and less people multiboxing. The world seems more populated but really there's less people playing more characters and most of those people are in their safe spaces making isk.
---
lmfao go back to the belts 'blood' miner, you've got taxes to pay
---
If you'd just put your questions in here I am sure r/eve could awnser a lot of them for you. (Also so would I)
---
More like the neighbor's basement that smelled vaguely of borscht and vodka. It also came with a Snuffed infestation that took months to eradicate.
---
Hmm so me and my buddy are trying to figure out how to set up a space station. Is it even probable as beginner players or is that more down the road.
---
it's the wrong game you are looking for 1vs1's . in absolutely most cases you should expect 1vsMany fights  and it is current \*solo\* state of the game
---
The snippets are just lame memeing and shitposting, that happens on literally every discord server ever. Not even noteworthy.
---
And 13yo it seems.
---
I got 1.2bn out of one in Delve, once. It's my claim to e-fame.
---
No I'm not going to quit my day job.
---
i think eve university probably has a public discord, look it up. your corp channel also probably has some helpful folks
---
That depends on how new you are. If both of you just started out you will probably not have the financial means to aquire a Citadell but there is also no real reason you should put one up. In fact to put one up you would have to creat a corporation which is nothing bad but if you then deploy a structure that makes you war eligable which means people can declare war against you and then (after 24h) shoot you in Highsec without any penalty. If you want to deploy the citadell in Lowsec or 0.0 I would advise against that too as you do not have the means to defend it if its only you two and people shoot them because they are bored quite a bit.
---
Can confirm, they RP space chickens well!
---
which is exactly what pearl abyss does to BDO. For example, see sea monster hunting. It was the best way to make money in the game and anyone could work their way up to it and do it but it was reducing the amount of time people had to spend playing the game to see results which PA doesn't like. They have a history of making their games more difficult to make players feel the need to buy microtransaction shit. In this case, buy plex.
---
I had a lot of fun with a dual web point ab vigil fleet issue. The main problem is no one really wants to fight you because you have ridiculous amounts of range control. However, in my opinion this is offset by the ridiculous amount of range control you get. Just keep at around 13km range, or whatever you can actually hit at with faction rockets (watch this video to understand rocket ranges , the numbers the fitting window gives you are lies https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UVhTyBltMUg&amp;t=297). As long as it’s beyond what you expect your opponent’s optimal to be then you’re good, and if they happen to be hitting out to your range just warp off. 
---
Against mwd kiters, just heat webs and then get as close as possible to get under guns, since you can’t disengage from them. You can probably kill them if you catch them, however
---
Lets all just admit we've all at one stage mwd'd into our bombs before. :')
---
Glad you are banned and i can take my stuff through uedama and not have to worry about your bitch ass
---
I think what the person meant was its turning towards buying plex a necessity to stay competitive when they constantly nerf the amount of isk you can make in pve in a guise to make it seem like they're "balancing" it.
---
Fuck you Mom
---
Post stuff if there's anything about his ban, anything about ingame politics, or any funny salt/ridiculous spin. I don't really give a shit about the man's sexual preferences, my dude. You seem to think that Brisc liking pierced nipples is way more interesting than it actually is...

Fighting on home turf = close to no travel time

Am I understanding skills/skill books correctly in that to buy the ability to learn the skill Cloaking its 6.5 million ISK, but i could just buy the book on the marketplace for ~5 million? Is there a difference between the two in terms of what im getting?
---
They were [very much different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vTmzNeJMkk) back then. Courtesy of /u/Rykoza.
---
This is all rather sad and I'm genuinely upset that this is how our community treats each other.
---
You're wearing a spot into that sofa you're living on.
---
...
---
So, how do you see the leaks?
---
I mean in reality hardly anyone plays Eve now. Definitely not “ded gaem” but 18-22,000 players is hardly thriving for an MMO of this scale. Then you take into account that at least 2,000 of those are alts and yeah it’s pretty poor.
---
The problem is, how do you attract more people to a niche game like Eve?
---
Lol I would like to know the context because this doesn't sound serious
---
I’d recommend just not doing solo to start. FW gets old after a while (too rock/paper/scissors), and in nullsec being good at solo usually means having a lot of experience AND being able to buy expensive ships. 
---
Instead, join one of the big nullsec blobs. You can probably tell the specific one I recommend from my flair, but honestly all of them are good. If you learn from the mistakes of other solo players by hunting them in something like a ramjag and letting your alliance provide the dps, you’ll know a lot of what not to do (mostly just don’t let a jaguar get under your guns, but that’s easier said than done), what does work against stuff like ramjags, and you’ll have a lot of fun hanging out with your alliance/Corp. Then you can start roaming enemy space and trying to copy the tactics that were successfully used against you.
---
No fighting children,  they are both awful
---
Well...  It's akward...
---
Although interesting, I don't think it would work well in EVE as the concept of ships as ammunition is deeply ingrained to most players at this point. Adding crew as a part of fitting would not only violate this but require an extensive re-balance of the game. Also, while our ships usually have crew, capsuleer ships are retrofitted to require less crew then a standard vessel. You are a majority of the crew. Also, from a mechanics perspective implants already fill a similar role, as a "crew upgrade" that can survive a ship loss.
---
Right click, loop.
---
I can't tell if this is supposed to make me like him, or dislike him.
---
Yeah, I think alphastar assumed someone would tell the crucifiers and other ewar ships to orbit at some larger distance to avoid that, but nobody did, so they just approached him along with the rest of the fleet
---
Darkness at least only feeds t3cs, ruptures, and corms. Test feeds dreads and faction forts.
---
Depends on the spawn rate, which despite what people say, is still voodoo magic.
---
Oh I believe 100% adding any kind of crew or population mechanic would be met with the normal conservitive like hostility about changing the game in anyway. 
---
If it was a mechanic that players could ignore, maybe. But the moment it's needed for min maxing performance in some way it'll increase cost and effort by players.
---
And how does this post without any context help the greater eve community?
---
Well, eventually he would've figured out all that by himself anyways. I just sped it up a bit.
---
People still join Darkness? Why?
---

R/pandemichorde
---
Unfortunately, no one ever really picked a name for Panfam + FRT + HRE + SkillU + GotG + literally every nullsec alliance not in legacy or Imperium, so it’s not like there’s an easy name to use. Imperium and Legacy made up a good name on their own, so it did stick. 
---
Speaking of that, do we even have a name for the war that happened last summer? Because I feel like a war with three consecutive Titan battles should at least have some recognition.
---
Rookie help and English general help will answer a lot of new player questions.
---
Nothing says “I bought this in Hek” like a Tempest with 4 different meta levels of 1400mm Artillery.
---
Its the exact same skill, no difference.
---
[removed]
---
The UI advice is pretty helpful to a new pvper, but the manual flying advice needs some work.
---
B. If you're at 40km, they warp off once they realize you're kite fit. you need to be within point range.
---
E. Auto-track moves your camera around when you click on things. You need to control your own camera. I don't see a use for auto-track.
---
F. Sometimes you can use keep at range at a certain range. Imagine killing a slow tanky frigate in your fast frigate. just keep at range 20km with turret kite ships. you get better tracking and you normally aren't at risk against slow frigates.
---
G. You can use orbit command against slow ships that can apply to you, where need to keep your speed up. You'll still being able to safely hold them, and can take over manually if you think a slingshot will work.
---
Easier to outtrack/less ehp through. You can usually kill Leshaks well before their ramp gets high enough to be an issue.
---
Vedmaks also tend to come with EWAR support Damaviks (who also RR) which makes them honestly scarier imo.
---
Or maybe don't be a spaz, moron.

Jita does more trade than all the other hubs combined... by a long chalk!

This Saturday the 20th at 20:00 Eve time the first rounds of the Streamfleet Showdown Invitational goes live on the [Streamfleet Channel](https://twitch.tv/streamfleet). 8 Teams Face off over 2 weekends, with many known Alliance tournament participants and commentators involved! There are prizes for the winning teams and plenty of prizes for all of the viewers - so be sure to tune in and check it out!! 
---
Some awesome people put in a lot of time and effort into this, and it's going to be a good show for us all!
---
I almost feel like this is more like what it would truly sound like, if anything.

Thanks!

Shhhhttttt! Now you ruined everything ^^

Caldari masterrace has won the economic warfare.

You sound very salty 😂😂😂

What does that have to do with 1vv1s turning into 5v1s..
---
You right click in space, select asteroid belts and get a list of them. Top belt is the topmost one in that list. Do note that it is generally not recommended to go there in Tama, for reasons you'll find out the first time you go there to see what it is.
---
The only way to get experience is to do solo pvp. Advising new players to fly overpowered tackle ships isn't going to help them improve. You learn a lot more by getting dunked than you do by dunking.
---
That was terrible even for reddit

I am pretty sure the context is that it is common for women to get piercings  at the age 13 t(specifically the ears), therefor it should not be out of the ordinary to get piercings elsewhere. 
---
I dont like the guy, but I think context rules out penophelia.
---
Yeah that’s another good reason too! Don’t have to take your blue loot and salvage to two different places.
---
Not to mention at triple the price 😂
---
The difference is that one requires you to buy one in a station selling it, where as the other can be done from anywhere.
---
Unless of course the incompetence is purely created by being a raging dumpster fire.
---
you were announced on intel yesterday in a Tornado in ZXB-VC :)) good to be ex INIT member and know all the things going on in delve/fountain and where to hunt...
---
What sort of ded FW space were you flying in?  
---
You can get fights pretty often in and around Amamake. Got around 60 kills this week only flying solo T1 frig and dessie.
---
these guys were one of the frontlines in your guys' war against the south not very long ago. amusing how fast panfam has been shitting on their allies
---
If youre in null the response fleets are super easy. 
---
If its a NPC empire spawn, grab a ship with a combat scanner. Wait for the hauler to land. Shoot hauler, let it warp off, and warp yourself off before the response fleet kills you. Then you combat scan it down. a single carrier solos it super quickly, and you get all the ore/strongbox/faction modules from all the wrecks (t2 salvage if the ships are t2).
---
 if its a pirate spawn, things are a little harder. Same plan, agress and warp off, then combat scan them. Warp your scanner off 100km cloaked up, then warp the carrier 100km off the scanner. Drop fighters while you allign out, blap the hauler and recall the fighters that you can, warp the carrier off if needed. Chances are youll loose a squadron, but the stringboxs ive gotten off of them sell for about 240m.
---
Join ASCEE
---
Drone ships like the Tristan are good for fighting at point range (~20km). You can even fit a couple neuts to help keep them from getting an easy scram. 
---
Missiles are also great for kitey fits though not sure any t1 gal ships use them.
---
How do i apply to join?
---
post gud
---
Take a look at horde. They have a channel called "join horde" or something
---
Hey, please direct your attention to the following safety announcement [Dreddit is actually Recruiting!](https://dredditisrecruiting.com) 
---
We are a large Nullsec, pvp entity with a massive industrial backbone. if you want to experience the best of nullsec then look no further, we fly everything from small gang kitchen sink fleets up to multi thousand tidi inducing headaches ... i mean battles. 
---
We are a member of TEST alliance and we live down in Esoteria which is some excellent space for all your ratting, mining, production and exploration needs. 
---
Come join the good guys!
---
It's been a while since we've had good meme videos. Keep it up.
---
1: if you're in goons, why tf are you asking on reddit?
---
2: if you're not in goons, why tf would you want to join goonwaffe?
---
You should see the NSFW channel on mine!
---
It sure seemed implied to me. You're a dickhead, even for an eve player.
---
You're drunk, go to bed.
---
No
---
This guy meme'd too late and boy it's awkward
---
&gt; amusing how fast panfam has been shitting on their allies
---
Pika.
---
well, would be great if you could summarize it in one post, because OP literally asked whats the benefits of having a citadel
---
I've yet to die in t5 darks, cause noprop HAM Cerb does them pretty much with eyes closed. I've min-maxed dps and i can pretty reliably do 4 sites in about 60-65 minutes including looting side containers.
---
Dark Matter increases speed and gives a hefty penalty to turret optimal, however NPCs still orbit at their normal ranges. So they both outtrack and/or arent in optimal range of their own turrets, lol.
---
Fun fact - i've speed-tanked a full citadel leshak spawn (the single room with 13 or so leshaks and semiotic consoles) with 5 starving and 5 tangling ones by orbiting gate at 500 and pretty much only getting 1-2 stray hits once in while.
---
Darks are also second-cheapest after Firestorms, cause Gilas cant do them.
---
“HOW MUCH?“
---
I'd watch the popular streamers on how they solo in FW space.
---
-EveLog (Jebi)
---
-Andy Virus are good examples and have some vids in what they do and what fights/ships are engageable
---
Ofc, nullsec solo is the most exciting, but is blobby as fuck. Also consider wormholes at some point.
---
The guy was posting about being excited to join his first fleet battle not the BR  you fucking autistic cunt
---
It's how I lost my first bomber, I was testing the launcher out on rats, blew up my own ship
---
Guristas rats v0v
---
Darkness tried a similar trick with a Keepstar when they hit the Drone Regions back in 2017. Although that deployment went far better than Tests recent trip north.
---
Glad you could, was one hell of a show!  Haven't been this excited for a null battle in awhile
---
I laughed at that too, but hey everyone makes mistakes. Good show on your guys' part!
---
We have cookies
---
Structure spam is one of the main reasons im glad i live in null tbh
---
And unless you are flairbaiting what you accuse them off so far TAPI seems to be having a lot of issues with defending when it comes to krabbing.
---
they have those non time wasting overlay things they can use. pop ups are for stuff that actually matters.
---
Lol you do realise that tgey dont gave to provide evidence to anybody except himself. Who are you guys think you are that you even think it is your buissines here.
---
One of the frontlines you say, in a war that took place how long ago? By those standards TAPI would have not sucked off the Russians to shoot TRI who helped TAPI get their current space in the South.
---
You haven't roamed around null sec a lot recently, have you? Especially Delve
---
“Ascendancy recruitment” in game channel have ur buddy join too
---
&gt;same perks
---
lol ok my dude, let me tell you about our double srp, constant pressure to get a space job and our HIV positivity. Karmafleet doesn’t even compare
---
I think he said 'F\*\*k' once too, but i am not sure.
---
Honestly, back in 2004 or so I was walking to the bus stop one chilly morning and almost crapped myself when I heard a gate spooling up.
---
Turned out to be a police siren.
---
The sides are fucked up
---
love elo forever！
---
He said that he didn't receive any evidence or clear reason either and that he didn't do what he's accused of.
---
CCP put themselves in a pretty bad light with this stunt in the eyes of many EVE players, despite gaining publicity.
---
They don't have to provide anyone evidence you might say, but then we should not not trust a word they say either.
---
Therefore I have good reason to believe Brisk is innocent as the word of CCP doesn't hold weight in my opinion. 
---
I think your mistake is to think that no company would have no reason to wrongfuly slander someone.
---
There can be things, for examply publicity, political parties affiliated with the company and even personal grudges of people with power in that company.
---
CCP made that article public for us to read so it is our business to comment on it and to be concerned on how CCP is publicly going after a player who can be identified with his real persona.
---
&gt; Saying that it was no effort/challenge is in my view fairly disrespectful. 
---
I wasn't being disrespectful, I just didn't / don't see the same level as risk in it that you do.  8K/sec (~1.9 double webbed) affords so many tactical options and provides so much intrinsic tank paired with the sig radius of a frigate I'm just not seeing it.
---
&gt; Also, please stick to facts when attempting to trash talk. 
---
I'm not trash talking anyone. If I'm wrong and its much more risky than I'm giving them credit for then so be it.
---
&gt;  If you look closely you could also see how great the piloting itself was.
---
I don't think the piloting was bad at all. The positioning and transversal was generally very good and, hell, keeping out of any dicey situations is the main job when you're flying something like this. Its the 'never being in a position where they are threatened' ... that's the piloting skill involved. I just think the ship / fit itself makes that too easy. The fit doesn't seem to make any trade of. He's got tank, speed, control and weapons.
---
Get a hurricane with 3 sensor boosters, and a point, artillery and damage lows (1 damage control). Rigs can be some tank.
---
Sit 0 on a gate and instablap everything that comes through
---
\*spautism
---
But that is a double negative.
---
Maybe but i could never buy everything i wanted to buy in hek but could in dodixie.
---
With that dmg taken and the stabs in the lows? I doubt he was afk. He probably refitted while tackled, but the Tengu had more scam power?
---
Maybe he works for CCP?
---
init confirmed gon
---
I don't understand your logic at all. Horde went from living in a cramped 1 room shack (essentially almost everyone crabbing in just a few constellations in Fade) to living in Geminate and large parts of nearby regions + an entire other region for renting.
---
If that doesn't sound like a giant step up, please, tell me what would be?
---
Damn, those names bring back memories. Like shooting Tank CEOs Raven in P3EN-E back in 2003, before stacking penalties on shield hardeners were introduced, we had 5-6 Battleships shooting while he slowboated back to gate (while webbed). He just tanked us np!
---
As opposed to horde, who only feeds on NC.'s breastmilk.
---
Because everytime you dock, there is a homeless, hipster gallente with a toering and snot covered beard trying to hug you
---
Long gone.
---
CCP removed the super highways from and to Yulai.
---
Jita was chosen, because back when bloodlines mattered, everyone made an Achura for the best starting skills...
---
so most traders and producers startet around Jita ;)
---
Or a Minmatar one ?
---
**New release, version 1.4.3**
---
Yesterday evening we released version 1.4.3 of EVE Workbench which introduces a few visual changes on the frontpage and a few bugfixes.
---
* \[ENH\] Alpha and Omega fittings are nog being split on the frontpage view;
---
* \[FIX\] Drone range was fixed on 20km, fixed to match skills;
---
* Other small bugfixes
---
Thats how it used to work for most actions. When citadels were introduced they removed session timers in them for about 6 months, then after a couple rare bugs were discovered they shoddily reimplemented them.
---
I mean it's the internet ... Everything can be easily faked, and Discord logs has always been in that everything.
---
did you ever sit in something that doesnt have drones? if yes, explain me how one would ''afk rat'' in a ship with turrets?
---
looks like every discord with meme shit in it ever. Still waiting on the juicy stuff and if you don't have it then stfu.
---
Test Server Please Ignore :P
---
just make it so they need "solar power" or some shit and boom lore reason too
---
How do you hate a in game group of players, you shluld go outside more man.
---
Badly?
---
Great, thanks !
---
Think 1dq is probably a bigger hub than hek, Dodixie or rens now and it only really serves the imperium.
---
What ship/filament were you using?
---
Bad rewards
---
Shocker! CCP not checking things.
---
Just apply they accept anyone
---
Mobile dépôts probably got shot before he could fill my refit
---
The ranking starts at 0, so +1 on all those numbers :P
---
Probably 'inattentive ratting Nag' may be a better title.
---
If you are in the abyss at DT you will be pooped back out into k space.
---
I made the same mistake you did, only 5 minutes before dt
---
I mean, they also made fleet links hardly readable purple, because nothing grabs the attention more for a rorq save than a dark purple link ineligible on a dark background.
---
One step forward two steps back
---
One evening I’m in the middle of some pod piloting. I had a whale of a time, I had so much fun.
---
I’m also listerning to EVE radio. Fantastic music.
---
I hurry to the kitchen [6 meters away] to grab a drink from the fridge. As I’m pouring a glass, I hear the lock on chirp. Holy-mother-of-fuck!!! I almost jump out of my skin to get back to my ship. Then the DJ says ‘gotcha’, he had been playing the sound of the lock on chirp. I wanted to break that guy’s face.
---
/true story
---
Imagine actually thinking a one time tribute to stop a war means one side is now the other one’s pets or slaves.
---
Yeah i did that already
---
&gt; we can fly into without getting shot at
---
If you want this 100% you are not looking for null.
---
Being shot at is always a risk in nullsec.
---
Too safe
---
Tell that to El'Miner
---
2 is Polaris.  Redacted for opsec.
---
Well I mean not getting shot by EVERYTHING.
---
I'm willing to tolerate being shot at by about 5% of the shit i run into.
---
Hey i just wanna ask if i apply and join sucessfully it means I can fly through all the systems held by the Legacy Coalition to get to TEST, right?
---
I think 1DQ actually is second after Jita
---
No it is not, nullsec trade hubs have always been far worse than the shitiest Highsec trade hubs
---
I'd also advise against that. The first rule applies: 
---
\#1 Never fly (or in this case deploy) what you cannot afford to lose.
---
Yup
---
&gt;Rens / Hek are in Minnie space, who cares about those guys
---
I will fight you.
---
oh legit? i was under the impression you just get deleted.
---
Damn, was a stressful 5 minutes.
---
Hey yes that is correct, apply and once accepted join the corp before you start your journey otherwise you will appear as a neutral and will most like get blown up. 
---
but yes as a member of Dreddit you will be able to freely traverse any and all systems held by Legacy Coalition members. watch out for Simple farmers in HED-GP though.
---
They always are
---
Nope! As per MER, 1DQ is 3rd place!
---
Jita 1st
---
Amarr 2nd
---
~~ !DQ1-A 3rd ~~

No it isn't, it is 1 sentence. You didn't post the full dump, remember? Therefore, what is the point of this snippet?

Even battlereport, 30b isk killed. Sounds like an ideal engagement (both FC's fucked up if they allowed line members to have this much fun).
---
nice. thx for the info

Talk with your CEO. If he is as good as u said, he will udnerstood. Maybe even u will Give him a idea to move Corp one more Time, if u are not the only complaing one.
---
DARKNESS has territory to defend?..
---
ASCEE are good guys especially if you want to have a chill life/play balance.
---
KarmaFleet is not a starter corp, but sure, stay misinformed.
---
It happens. But most frig or dessie 1v1 takes like 30 seconds. So generally you can win or lose before help arrives as long as dscan was clear when you engage.

You are:

Lame as fuck. made me say lame in 2019, ouch.
---
Don't worry I probably won't need help moving stuff since I have no stuff.
---
*cries in 25mil net worth alpha clone*
---
Moving on is part of the game, the trick is to just not burn bridges, I have great connections and shared channels with most of my old CEOs and cool members - So I could always go back and they would take me with open arms. We talk every now and then and share our gaming experiences - we are just not in the same group and sometimes we even shoot each other.
---
The game is small, eventually you might find yourself playing with them again on a later point - it's great when you can vouch for each other.
---
Is PLH still alive?
---
Does Scooter McCabe still handle all applications?
---
Yeah, talk to the boss man and go do your thing. Everyone gets that "issue" in Eve at some point. You may no longer always be blue but the relationships will always be.
---
Ahhh come to Dreddit my boy, we have a mentoring program to get you on your feet and TEST Free can provide you with doctrine ships to get you into the fight. Hit me up if you do join and i'll help you out with getting yourself setup in our space and give you some money making tutoring. 
---
we also have a bunch of skills plans for new bros which can skill you into money makers and a decent fleet participation skill queue which gets you into doctrine ships in the first couple of days.
---
I guess I didn't take supers and rorqs into consideration. I believe if you take them out you loose a few dozen places

Unless you go out of your way to make the parting acrimonious, nobody worth respecting will be shitty about it, CEO included.
---
Fuck's sake, friendo, this is a game. It should be fun. If your CEO is *actually* generous then they'll fucking *tell you* to leave (or do whatever you need to do) in order to find fun again.
---
&gt; TAPI would have not sucked off the Russians to shoot TRI who helped TAPI get their current space in the South.
---
Horde sucked off those same Russians to get Geminate.
---
But you knew that.
---
Space stations are at minimum 600 million Isk.
---
Its not something a new player shoul do, as theres no benefit to a new player having one.
---
You cant run missions from it and you wont have the skills to make it worth it. 
---
It also costs at minimum 10 million a day in fuel costs.
---
You can join a corp that already has stations though. 
---
Or start a corp and work towards a station.
---
because it and the region its in is a fucking shit hole.
---
Why not make another alt to join your ex-corp mates? Then you can log in whichever alt that seems to be fun for the day.
---
Most goon rules around stuff like this usually are “against the rules .... unless its not”  there is always someone in goons who all leadership is totally fine with doing any type of scam
---
Sounds like it was a blast, glad you had fun! I missed it unfortunately :(
---
You're talking mad shit for someone in a ship that would get destroyed by a good spray of wd-40
---
&gt;If you go out solo and a gang catches you, that IS solo pvp.  There is not a place in New Eden where you will find a population of pilots who only fly solo.
---
Cool idea though. Also, a region of space for frig warfare. #ccplease.
---
dodixie is not a trade hub
---
You need to dispense if the notion that you're just a number. Every ship matters. KarmaFleet is recruiting.
---
r/evejobs is what you're looking for friendo
---
hmm, I know that for many years Farasoloni was the renting manager of B0T, didn't realize he was NC. and not PL leadership -.- ...
---
&gt; PIBC FC: @_everyone president decided we will move to TQ, you can start your preparation, this is a official announce
---
Seems like things on TQ are going to get a lot more interesting.
---
Begun the Chinese wars have
---
Pipebombing is back on the manues bois
---
Big if true
---
stick with me here, [Dreddit is Recruiting](https://dredditisrecruiting.com)
---
Now i know you said you don't like big Nullsec Corps, but i think that might be because you haven't found the correct one yet. Dreddit has a massive industrial backbone and excellent mining and production facilities, you can locally produce almost  every single item in the game and the markets are stocked and things move fairly quickly. 
---
We are a large entity but due to how Dreddit works we have that small corp feel, we are very lax on pvp participation (ideally some but we are flexible) and we are always looking for more people to utilise all resources at our disposal. 
---
and if you want to PVP well then we have you covered with round the clock fleets, specialised squads and sigs for all manner of eve activities, plus the wonderfulness (or headache inducing) fleet 6 coms to chill in and get to know your corp mates. 
---
Any questions please let me know.
---
He probably meant - 'a ratting nag that was afk', which is totally unlikely considering he tried refitting to warp core stabs when tackled.
---
more vni bots! \o/
---
Thanks for the insight, yes it really looks like they are just out for content and don't give a shit (currently) about the old blocks. The BRs they are involved in often look very confusing because of that
---
Value of isk going to drop radically in 3..2..1..
---
I'm actually hyped for that, more people more fights
---
What is the strength of pibc
---
We are indeed doing dumb things in amarrmil
---
&gt; more bots more ore
---
FTFY
---
Colossal if accurate
---
Just leave. You'll find alot of generous and nice people in eve. If the fun stops, start doing something about it.
---
How man people will that bring?
---
Nice, more dogshit content from a group of players that will do literally anything to win.  I hope you like even more bots.
---
I meant it as a dig about that time you joined PL, couldnt handle the heat so retreated back to lowsec newb bashing.
---
Chinese goons
---
If you take out Rorquals and Super/Titan Hulls from 1dq volume, it would drop belw rank 10 i guess (elaborate). This would be realistic ranking, as thesse goods are also not traded in the Hisec Tradehubs
---
Yep i think after 3 years i managed now most of the basics. Happy to start the advanced piloting commands
---
I have 3 accounts.  If I get caught in a 1 v 1 is was a mistake or a choice.  This is the norm in Eve.  Most other players are using multiple accounts.  This is what you have to overcome to get those 1v1's
---
PBIC Vs Goons
---
It's gonna be interesting :p
---
No, its gonna be 2k Titans vs 2k Titans in 0,0001% TiDi.
---
If you filter corps in game players to 1000 members you can easily see the adverts for test, brave, goon, horde. None have any requirements other then don't be a awoxer. The easiest way to get there is, apply but do not accept the invite. Travel high and low sec in a npc corp. When you are one jump off null sec, dock up and accept the invite, so your new corp mates don't kill you. If you can fly interceptors, you will be borderline unkillable. Make sure to set your new home as your home station so if you die, you will be reborn there.
---
Wonderful. Need more targets.
---
&gt; a group of players that will do literally anything to win
---
Because your experience of EVE so far has taught you anything different?
---
I don’t know who these clowns are but if they are joining our merry troupe on TQ, I believe ammo still works on space ships?
---
If it doesn’t feel like you’re being dragged over a bed of broken glass strewn over molten lava while you’re being shot at with canister, you’re not doing it right anyway.
---
If you don’t like what they do: find a new strategy. If you can’t be bothered finding a new strategy to deal with changing situations, maybe you want to try World of Warcraft, maybe? Hello Kitty Online?
---
Are you also hyped for PLEX Sub coming around 20 Billion ISK like on Serenity ? I am, as I sub with cc and sell PLEX \o/
---
Yay more dead rorquals for the rorqual throne
---
Then they shouldnt even have provided what they did in the first place. That whole thing is like the botter executions in yulai. CCP brought him to the chopping block just with enough Info so the public did the execution. I don't care if he is guilty or not but what CCP did was a fuckup with that anouncement
---
They were like Goons and NC. combined and dominated the rest of Singularity a lot of early Frat were refugees from PIBC.
---
Rooks and Kings did a video last year as think the lead guy is/was in PIBC he goes through a lot of detail.
---
That said it is domination by N+1 Titans so how they do on a fresh start and how many join who knows.
---
But I welcome more content.
---
Titan Spam, RMT pushing ISK so far down that PLEX sub costs 20 Bil ISK ...
---
maybe 50 will die in the process
---
that'd be nice
---
Says the mouth breathing oxy moron !
---
Seems like ISK on TQ are going to be as worthless as on Serenity ...
---
more players on tq, I'll take it
---
Wait. Wasn't PIBC already here? 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/a7oc9m/panintergalactic_business_community_chinese/
---
Target is current Serenity prices, 500 PLEX around 20 Bil ISK
---
hype
---
That is the skill urself rental group
---
Wont be there, I have a RL and being forced to stay on PC over night until next DT because the servers shit themselves is not an option for me ...
---
did you even read the responses to that thread or just the original post then x'd the tab?
---
Is there a livestream?
---
God fucking dammit.
---
I got got. :P
---
TEST corps have fleet time requirements.
---
Quick CCP, re-launch Serenity! *Re-launch Serenity!*
---
Thought experiment, imagine if CCP banned China, or gave/restricted them to their own server to bot to their hearts content
---
1DQ1 is 2nd. There is no mistake in the ranks. ,😂😂😂
---
Where I live there is no titans :p
---
Kenshin?
---
rip plex
---
I hear Tanoo is nice
---
On the plus side there is a chance he'll get to see a Titan killing stuff (him).
---
If goons get dunked by mecha!goons I'd have a giggle. But I am betting they will be another XiX.
---
Shiiiiet
---
Guys could somebody explain things to me, I’m actually really curious.
---
Where are these guys coming from? Is there another Eve server or something? What’s happening and who are they?
---
Shit
---
The Crazy Lady up north has been involved with leading B0T since its' inception.  You should know who the string pullers are dude.
---
Have you ever heard of pubg and/or the general sentiment towards gaming in China ?
---
The irony kills me
---
This was actually a pretty fun fight. I just wish the fleet was a few hours earlier. It was fun watching Horde blow up their own ships by accident :D
---
Blob if anchored
---
This is less about what someone's willing to do within the game mechanics, and more about what you're willing to do through things like botting swarms and so on.
---
Okay, you pay for the better ones then.
---
Find a new strategy. If you cant beat the bots, join in and bot. good idea! btw what bot program you use? I'm looking at a head start.
---
haha casual
---
If they come here, i think most of eve is gonna gang up on them and give them a taste of their own medicine.
---
Geminate
---
Even dreddit, Is that new? I don't remember that being a thing when I was with them.
---
\^\^ Pretty much what she said \^\^
---
It's a shame that I can't laugh and make jokes with my friends without somebody deciding they can farm some karma off it and try to embarrass me. 
---
But hey, I guess that's the price of playing a video game with your friends.
---
There's no fleet time requirement, right?
---
Due to government policies in china eve was licensed to a chinese company to translate and localise a version, this server is called serenity. That company never enforced anti botting policies and as such inflation became a problem to the point where 500 plex costs 20 bil. PIBC is one of (or the) big power bloc on that server, shit went down some time in the last year or 2 but it was stagnant with 3 powerblocs last time I looked into it.
---
As much as we all shit talk each other, I am very concerned at the notion of the unchecked botting  that will come with this- it's not bad or cheating or negative to them. It's culturally acceptable.
---
Just had Directive Albatross (Svarog) and Directive 29 (Veles)
---
Oh, you poor, clueless, soul.  Do we focus on training new players? Certainly.  Is it designed to "graduate" to another corporation?  Not in the slightest.  That is the difference.  "Starter corp" intimates that a player should be looking for something beyond KarmaFleet.  But KarmaFleet is already the pinnacle of GSF membership.  I mean, take a look at GSF leadership, KarmaFleet leads the way now.  There is nothing that GSF does that a member of KarmaFleet cannot be a part of.
---
Oh yeah, way to drag up an old forum post in a vain attempt to prove a point lol.
---
PIBC are the leading group on Serenity, the Chinese Eve server, they are notorious for bottling and N+1-ing the fuck out of everyone so them joining TQ is gonna be interesting.
---
Hooray, you killed a ship. Unfortunately the bots have paid for another 5 while you were doing it.
---
Nope, however it's encouraged to get involved.
---
Never change bo hunt

well that tipped me over the edge, bought 11,000 plex cause now im sure the price is gonna go up :)

Let me tell you about our corp srp, constant pressure to push our space jobs onto Waffe, and we gave you the HIV.  :D
---
I want the war of Mittens goons vs. The new chinese goons. Bring it on booiiis!
---
Is that the actual price of isk on serenity?
---
Oh I see, that’s interesting! I never knew there was another version of Eve, but it should be fun if we get more people on our version.
---
I agree, more conflict is good, botting will still be an issue but at least it actually is an issue on tranq.
---
&gt; s a pirate spawn, things are a little harder. Same plan, agress and warp off, then combat scan them. Warp your scanner off 100km cloaked up, then warp the carrier 100km off the scanner. Drop fighters while you allign out, blap the hauler and recall the fighters that you can, warp the carrier off if needed. Chances are youll loose a squadron, but the stringboxs ive gotten off of them sell for about 240m.
---
I think I'm going to play with this on SiSi. I didn't realize they dropped good loot. They didn't seem worth the effort a few days ago. 
---
Also may i ask exactly which systems are your major home systems?
---
Wow, you once again have to stoop to personal attacks because you can't come up with a valid counterpoint?  Get a life dude.
---
I’m sorry what is N+1? 
---
If they join the rest of the Chinese I think we’ll be in trouble haha
---
Welp, Rest In Piss, economy. It wasn't very nice knowing ya, but you were a thing, kind of.
---
I mean as the other guy said it was allowed on there, so could be possibly a bit different?
---
N represents any number, say Goons bring 1000 people, the Chinese response is to bring 1001 (or, more realistically, 1500-2000), they have mastered blobbing to the point that the Chinese server is basically dead.
---

---
Chinese are to eve players are what eve players are to casual gamers.
---
When your points are retarded you can't pretend to get hurt when it is pointed out. 
---
You're thinking of feeder corps, which is a whole other thing.
---
Karma fleet, horde, brave, are all starter corps/alliances. You just think that "starter" is a negative word so you don't want it on your corp.
---
That was me, lol, but that is what I meant, its seen as an issue rather than considered the norm.
---
Now consider that each 'person' you get comes with another X amount of VNI and mining bots, and suddenly things look a bit different.
---
It's fairly common knowledge that our home staging is in esoteria but not something I'd like to get into detail on a public forum
---
Then where you live doesn't matter :P
---
Made me chuckle, “mastered blobbing” well I guess there could be some interesting fights between them, PH, goons and the other big alliances..
---
We  i live there is only collateral damage :p
---
Confirming that PLEX pricing is about to get run over by a tank in the town square.
---
My bad haha didn’t notice the name. 
---
Now I understand, well I guess we will find out soon haha
---
Does this mean we have to not talk shit about Mao or communism? I hear the Chinese censors don't like their people exposed to critical thinking.
---
PBIC is blue to Goons
---
lol it was culturally acceptable in Goons for ages.... And its not like the drone lands/period basis/branch have been seeing a lot of actual players over the last 10 years
---
I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
Nice, thanks :)  
---
I'll have to re-read my Minmatar lore a bit, but will do for sure.
---
I can't speak to that, factually, and I'm not inclined to. I'll reiterate, I am concerned with an influx of thousands of players all with the mindset from the get go that botting, hacking and cheating are valid gameplay styles.
---
Warge if Accuwatt
---
REGION LOCK CHINA
---
In all honesty I think the teams are happy to compete for the sake of competing. Tournament play is what motivates a lot of the people in this tournament to stick with the game, but I tried my best to work with CCP to give them something for their time nonetheless.
---
yeah until the servers cant support anything and you are being yelled at to stay logged in for the next 12 hours or risk losing the ship you trained 3 years to get into  
---
engaging gameplay
---
Gonna have to ask you to calm down sir, your comma usage is through the roof I can see your veins popping out from here.
---
I never said the AAR said anything about the timer, I was referring to your first line of the comment I responded to.
---
&gt; They were securing the fort from the attackers you absolute mong.
---
They already *had* secured it from the attackers. They shoved them out of the hole, and killed a good chunk of their dudes. They already believed they had secured it. The *moment* they saw we were in system, they began planning to warp down to us and did within 2-3 minutes.
---
&gt; Jesus fuck, if you're going to argue and least get your story straight first you absolute cretin.
---
Why don't you get one at all before you try and sperg? I mean, it makes sense that you're just trying to stir shit up to make sinners look better, they really need the help.
---
But I'd at least try and get *any* information about what actually happened before trying to spout provably incorrect things :/ Doesn't really work out too well.
---
&gt; All you idiots do is chat shit in local

Yeah, it's the one thing that sets us apart :)

Yea i have a few. How many People do you have ?  And where are you located im currently in the aridia area where i have worked and loved the last few months. I did find the right corp once but alliance leadership ( i was in evictus Then ) shoved things in my troath with what i could not do etc.
---
Minmatar lowsec wasn't terrible a year or so ago. You won't always get 1v1 but there were plenty of guys who would do so back then.
---
Depends how you look at the game tbh. Even slow motion fights are fun for me as long as there’s still explosions, if it was as you said about getting blown up.. Fuck it, alt f4 go to sleep then come back when tidi is done and apply for srp 🤣😂

Ah okay. Sorry about being insensitive.

&gt;If they join the rest of the Chinese I think we’ll be in trouble haha

They don't much care for each other.
---
Will translate what I can:
---
@House,Man with bow, Oil drill, Robot.  Clothes rack, alien spaceship, man, forward operating base, man with stick, fire exit, ladder, hangman, minas tirith,  picture of clothes rack.
---
Yeah, because spinning up 15 alpha bots on virtual boxes and pulling 600m/hr is fun and engaging content.
---
&gt;how you look at the game tbh. Even slow motion fights are fun for me as long as there’s still explosions, if it was as you said about getting blown up.. Fuck it, alt f4 go to sleep then come back when tidi is done and apply for srp 🤣😂
---
You do realize this is because the price of the isk is devalued, not because the value of the plex increased right? So your 20 billion isk you bought with your 500 plex will have the same buying power as 2 billion isk currently has.
---
It wasnt about the agents per se, but back in the day you only had a limited amount of industry slots. Jita has one of the highest, if not the highest amount of industry slots in one system. This all changed when they removed the industry slot restriction and instead started using an industry index tax. This was also major reason why having a pos in high sec was an advantage. You had your own dedicated industry and research slots.
---
im just going to buy some extra plex so i can plex for 2-3 years
---
...you mean serenity, the chinese eve server?
---
Way to spin something completely out of context in order to shift a comment into something much more sinister than it really is.
---
Gotcha. Thanks!
---
And this is why the Federation must be destroyed.
---
giant if genuine
---
Yup, my bad- didn’t realize they already had one. I’d like to amend my exhortation to just include region-locking China to Serenity
---
You are the one that made "starter" a negative in your original reply.  I am pointing out your fallacies.  We are not a "starter" corporation.  New player friendly?  Certainly.  However, the way that you talk about starter corps shows that you think it is something to be looked down upon, so therefore, we are not a starter corp, as KarmaFleet is better than anything The Initiative. has to offer (going by your probable flairbait).
---
Again, you stooped to the personal attacks because you can't come up with an actual, valid, response.
---
Wow, an eve post worthy of r/imverybadass. Get a life.
---
Congratulations in becoming a part of the cancer that is ruining news-related information distribution by sharing irrelevant things simply to make a situation more dramatic about the unimportant issues.
---
Karmafleet better than init lol. Right
---
1 guy and 20,000 robotos
---
Is this really the best of it?
---
Currently we have around 3700 ish pilots but that will include a lot of alts, I would say a more Conservative estimate about be around 300 to 500 active players per day
---
We live in esoteria and are a member of Test alliance which is a part of Legacy along with evictus. However we are little more lax on some things, fleet participation isn't mandatory however it is encouraged and often good fun.
---
Why is that a problem my man? This is what eve is to me, blowing shit up, content. I don’t care if it’s already replaced or not and how much isk they got in their wallets.
---
No no it's alright just don't want to give out too many speicifcs where the whole world can see :)
---
Since PIBC will move to TQ. Will RnK come back too?
---
This is all well and good, but before everyone starts crying the sky is falling, CCP has been doing more to eliminate bots. I'm pretty sure they aren't so dumb as to expect PIBC to come over and just stop, and will semi-react semi-accordingly.
---
We did.
---
We are good at this game.
---
We are elite.
---
who the fuck reads replies?
---
thats for pussies
---
quitting never felt so good
---
Good bot.
---
Since the chat logs are plain text and **they** tend to get disconnected from the internet when the filter catches censored terms, I suppose it would be simple to get rid of them via local.
---
Mao Ze Donkey?
---
What makes you think that PIBC would be not immediately blue to Goons? Considering the history, P.L.A. and other stuff?
---
I'm pretty sure they'd need to start from scratch though.
---
Wasn't PLA in goons the first wave of PBIC?
---
That explanes why all my drones were ruthlessly murdered lol. But you gotta admit, an ares pew pewing you with 300 drones assigned to it is a scary sight LOL
---
Just a dream...
---
will RnK be back as well?
---
Rooks and kings welcome back...
---
Now you know why Quant had to go ...
---
*cries in overtime on the weekends*
---
AUTZ will get massive content spike,  
---
which it good.
---
PL is valid?
---
Because -
---
(a)  It drives out any players who grind plex for their subscription who don't bot themselves, causing less content
---
(b) It gives a large advantage to alliances who bot over those who don't, likely causing those who don't to get evicted from their space
---
(c) It fucks over EVERYONE who doesn't bot who buys ships and modules, as botting massively increases isk inflation, making the stuff you buy more expensive.
---
Yaaaaaassssssssssss
---
Wth is PLA
---
Who ?
---
What is the irony ?
---
One of the Chinese Goon Corps notorious for botting.
---
Jita has so much traffic because of what it was prior to an update that removed its content. Jita was a natural hub for the starting missions given by Caldari mission agents so people started to flock there; sell their goods, loot, manufactured goods, etc. Once it was noticed that this location started to handle more market transactions than the rest of the universe combined, they removed the mission content and its now purely a trade hub. No mission will start or be directed into Jita since the update, no asteroid belts, etc.
---
So here's a though we need bots lots of bots BUT not to rat plex what have you but to sit in ever single normal space system every wh system and talk shit about mao and how much we love Winnie the Pooh all day every day.
---
Rip tranquility
---
So goons finally found someone to live in Period Basis, huh?
---
My bet is they ally with Imperium+legacy so they can have help fighting Frat. Then the north and south can have a Chinese proxy war.
---
Minus Goons and their pets, minus TEST, who would more likely work with them in a same "we are totally not cooperating" way Goons vs TEST do now for years.
---
I'm not sure why people expect some Deus ex machina save. North doesn't have enough people, South will cooperate with them, there's no one else to beat them.
---
There are skills like social connections that increase standing and others that lower tax rates.  Look at the trading section of skills.  Besides that start grinding missions for the npc corp that owns where you want to sell.
---
&gt;why is botting bad
---
Honestly, it looks like a trolling. 
---
1. How long is Serenity closed? Why did they decide to move in here only now?
---
2. If Great Firewall is unable to prevent them playing on Serenity completely, it still can do it quite uncomfortable: lags, disconnects etc. 
---
3. Without a text/hyperlink, which everyone could read/translate himself using Google, this text could mean "want to sell a used bicycle" or "eat a bag of dicks".
---
&gt;semi-react semi-accordingly
---
Lol!
---
You don't acutally sit at your pc in those fights. Jump, lock target, go to job, come home, f1
---
Jita 4-4 Caldari Navy Assembly Plant is the biggest market station in Eve.
---
Yes
---
Brought to you by spodbrain.
---
Whataboutism.
---
Even so, now we’ll have even more botters.
---
Station trading is a meme. We already have enough sell/buy orders on the markets that we don't really need more for at least 4-5 years. In 4-5 years station trading will be outclassed by 'drop trade', that is, two ships dropping the items 100km away and burning for the other can in a deepspace spot.
---
Tl;dr it is not worth it, move to lowsec and farm fw/lvl5s.
---
Barely slowed Frat down at all.
---
&gt; need bots lots of bots BUT not to rat plex what have you but to sit in ever single normal space system every wh system 
---
OMFG. I love it.
---
Some PIBC Chinese are already in Goons, in P.L.A. corp. These guys are going to be blue with Imperium, or bluetrals the same way Goons and TEST are.
---
Basically more and more people piling on the (currently) winning side. Sad but that's humans for ya.
---
We cant stop them from coming to TQ, so the onus falls to CCP to get their heads out of their asses and give players a mechanism for dealing with this.  For starters:
---
*Local.  Delay.*
---
The higher the npc ships killed/hr, the longer the delay.  Mega krabbed botting systems should have anywhere from a several minute delay upwards to no local at all.
---
Oh no, the horror, people botting and n+1ing how are we ever going to deal with it, we're such a virgin server that never faced those issues !
---
What? Like Serenity? It worked out swell....
---
Just to be safe, you really ought to avoid talking about the Tienanmen Square massacre, slamming Xi Jinping, talking about human rights violations in Tibet, etc...
---
all people have bots, like you need a bot on chineese server.
---
Wrong. FRT are literally refugees from PIBC rule. PIBC are allied with Goons.
---
You sound like a fellow trader... ;)
---
people change when it comes down to survival, they will do everything they can to survive, if that happens everyone will cooperate. If they wont it will end up same as serenity.
---
Awful idea.  Or do you like the idea of garmurs fucking everything to death?
---
it's not because there is a chinese corp in goons that all PBIC will join Goons
---
If the PRC finds eve to toxic in its freedom of expression, maybe they'll region lock themselves. :)
---
Guys seriously this is like 4th or 5th comment that expects Goons and PIBC not being allied. PIBC literally have a corp within Goons, those "Mittens goons" are (if chinese) literally PIBC testing waters on TQ.
---
the only problem is that each player will come with bots, bots that you will need too compete with.
---
People change when it comes down to survival. They will do everything to survive, even cooperate. If they wont then it may become another serenity. Would be nice to see Goons fighting them at least:D
---
We got it, you're a vegan.
---
He wants you to be just another number in a massive alliance
---
cheap at four times the price
---
These points make sense, I was talking about your initial point where you said you blow up a ship and he’s already paid for 5 more
---
just spam june 4 1989 tiananmen square massacre over and over
---
That’s not what I meant, but look at it how you want to. I was talking about blowing up shit
---
Oh you sweet summer child.
---
This will be very unhealthy for the game. TQ will become a ghost town like serenity...
---
I would of expected for the biggest power bloc to want some content, allying with another power bloc like that would be silly imo
---
Which is what I said. FRT and PIBC don't really get along.
---
You didn't really win eve if you still lurk this subreddit ;)
---
Miss u avdot
---
with daddy's creditcard you really aren't starting "fresh" ... and CCP have to already love them as they know how much $$ they gonna spend to catch up on TQ.
---
2019 yearly financial review will be looking absolutely awesome to CCP's  PA overlords. Who cares about players, bots and shits... ccp doesnt, business is business
---
Lol
---
I enjoy reading about it, but I don't have the time or money needed to keep playing it
---
Lol.
---
Worse !
---
I’m a wormholer btw
---
who cares
---
That's called a strawman. You can't just take a tiny bit of someones argument and ignore the main point, then wonder why people are shitting on what you have to say about it.
---
nOtHinG wR0Ng
---
... Which is a problem for the reasons above.
---
why do you think they would be hostile to goons?
---
Eh, not too difficult. Get an in with a few unscrupulous renters, get a few accounts running VNI bots and shit snowballs fast. VNIs are cheap and have low sp requirements, and running just a few of those 23.5/7 will quickly get you enough skill injectors to have a stable of capital pilots and some carriers and so on.
---
Now multiply this by however many of them migrate here and it'll start having quite the impact.
---
This is a profile view of the one released last week where the camera travelled down the length of it.
---
I'm still kind of thinking drone or fighter
---
Why would one need a reasons to be hostile to goons :E
---
The trick to bartering is to act offended at the initial offer no matter what the price is.
---
Then talk them down from there.
---
Also, dont let them try to work livestock into the deal.  Very common practice in some lower developed nations.  Like Hek/Rens.
---
Hahahahahahahaha
---
Just because I understand something differently, that’s ignoring the point?
---
We can stop them from claiming space by attacking their alliance and any coalition harboring them :thinking:
---
Don't expect CCP Games to save us, they'd rather have 30,000 botters paying money than 10,000 real players.
---
I'll take VPN for $500
---
oh fuggg
---
This punishes people who don't bot just as hard as it punished those that do.  Is it really a fair solution?  I don't think so.
---
I mean, it is, in all aspects.  Init. only exists because they have big brother to back them up, and the biggest folks in GSF are KarmaFleet.  That is just the truth, sorry to burst your bubble.
---
A Chinese group.
---
Yet here you still are
---
&gt; How long is Serenity closed? Why did they decide to move in here only now?
---
I thought it was still online but nor currently supported by CCP.
---
Is this pic from eve?
---
it's called making comparisons

What server do you play on? You do know Singularity isn't the live version?

yep

You can even, through the web browser interface, doctor 'screenshots' of discord to say anything you want.  All it takes is hitting F12, finding the line of source via 'search' and changing it to whatever you want.

GBT, you mean the guys living in Fountain since over 10 years and could not be purged, neither by BOB/IT, PL, Hero Coalition or Goons now?

Ha ha.

just hope they wont be on the imperium side, a 4th power bloc can be very cool :=)

No idea what the hell this mean but someone is screwed?

Well, a person can look at your zkill history and also see that in all your past fights you had no backup when you died. This means they can gang up on you for an easy dunk.

These kinds of guys are afraid of an even fight, thats why they are piling onto you.

Great video. Some really nice expensive ships there, and very well flown. Thanks for posting :)

You will never hear me say I’m very badass. Most certainly not when it comes to kicking ass in EVE. I’m just not that good.

What I am good at, better than a lot of you blubbering babies, is to take the ass kicking and carry on regardless. Apparently that’s news to you snow flakes.

Can I help you with a tissue to dry the tears? A warm hug, maybe? Would you like a safe space?

It's a perfect example of a whataboutism. "What about Goons?"

Are you complaining about the fact that there are worse assholes than you are?

Because it sounds like you’re complaining about the fact that there are assholes bigger than yourself.
---
I have formulated my suggestion to neutralise bots. If nobody’s interested in implementing it, don’t come crying.
---
To integrate into current vocabulary: “Present topic of (conversation? Argument?)”
---
“Archived space-time co-ordinate ranges”
---
“Jovian Polity (Expanding City-state? Expanding civilization?) iters. (Shorthand for ‘iterations’?) [2.0.0],[2.7.2.0]”
---
(( If “iters.” is short for “iterations”, the [2.0.0],[2.7.2.0] numbers may be referencing iterations of a Jovian Polity, or city-state, mathematically expressing a period of time in the Jove Second Empire, from its beginning to almost 3/4 through its history. There’s nothing else to support this in this information, cross-reference with other documentation))
---
“recode++process! cannot fully/properly integrate with the data currently being processed/received”
---
((This is the second half of the previous line, but the first half required its own analysis. This half seems to indicate, of the analysis of the other is correct, that the Collective is literally having some difficulty processing that the Jove Second Empire has disappeared.))
---
“Evocation (bringing forth? Unclear what’s being brought forth) of ancient noemata (“Noema” refers to a subject of opinion or judgement, this is likely a different form of the same word) of Kostorg (I don’t know this term, and can’t find it in any resource, but capitalization indicates it’s a noun) flow and confluence”.
---
((On closer examination, noemata may be referring to an opinion or judgement, and what’s being stated is that ancient opinions are being brought forth, either on this “Kostorg”, or Kostorg’s opinions on something else, like the Second Empire.))
---
In summary, it’s been determined elsewhere that the Triglavian are a splinter faction of Second-Empire Jove, but this document seems to indicate they haven’t surface from the Abyss to update their records on the main Jove empire since about 3/4 through the Empire’s history... and are having some difficulty accepting that the Second Empire is long gone.

Me too, i sub 4 Accs with CC since 2007, but I like to sell plex ingame so I have ISK to pew and no need to krab.
---
I'd like to point u to my good friend u/Trepnock who memes on people and gets kills in Herons
---
The comment, and a lot of the discussion in the thread (which I know you're aware of because you've replied to more than one comment about it) is about botting, and you choose to ignore all of that and say you "like blowing things up so why does /u/mothyy have a problem with that?" [paraphrased]
---
That's the definition of a Strawman, and yes, it is absolutely 'ignoring the point' regardless of how you dress it up. 
---
If you were to say "botting is bad, but I think that having more ships in space makes up for it," then you'd have an incredibly unpopular opinion, and a weak argument given the lack of supporting logic or evidence, but it's still a perfectly *valid* argument because you are attacking his position as a whole, and not misrepresenting it by attacking a small part. 
---
Simply ignoring the botting issue and saying "yeah but I like blowing things up" is a strawman because you're not attacking his position (or point) [that botting is bad], but instead attacking a minor portion of his argument (in this case, a part of his illustrative example). Because you aren't actually arguing against his position, your argument isn't considered valid (the term for this particular invalidity, or 'logical fallacy,' is a 'strawman').
---

The prospect is just a (worthless) direct upgrade.
---
The endurance is for that oh-no moment when you see combat probes on D-scan when gas mining.
---
Though to be honest I've only used the venture before.
---
Yes.

We're gonna need those 240mil ticks to afford PLEX prices

Maybe "involved" but B0T was a joint venture of PL and XIX when it was founded, B0T was building a large chunk of PLs Supercap&amp;Titan-Fleet back then. The renting manager and 1st point of contact was Farasoloni from PL, Don't know when it changed, but thats how it was ... defacto

This may be the singlemost naive comment I've ever read on this sub.

Noone is stating the sky is falling.

Calm down

I think you should focus on converts vs. spawn rates brother.
---
🦀🦀🦀 CCP IS POWERLESS AGAINST A CHINESE RMT ALLIANCE 🦀🦀🦀
---
Good luck outfighting them in China Prime TZ. TZ tanking was a mistake.
---
stop trying to make "whataboutism" a thing
---
Why is that? I’m a relatively new player, or would you expect everyone to know about Eve politics and how things work?
---
They can both cloak and the prospect gets the same gas bonuses as the venture, why would you use an endurance at all?
---
Filthy casual.
---
Fytfy.
---
Because it can fit through frigate wormholes?
---
They're using VPNs to connect to TQ. Unless Chinese computer science experts have figured out how to defeat all encryption and aren't telling anyone, it's extremely unlikely that this will do anything.
---
If you are USTZ, we could fleet up and I'll see if I can help you out.
---
but there is
---
They will have to build up "from zero". Considering how Fraternity build up "from zero" it's probably not going to be very long until they are a decent force.
---
No offense, but it doesn't sound like you're speaking "factually" about Chinese botting culture either.  This is all pretty anecdotal, circumstantial, and generally based on the reading of a large group as homogeneous--which is exactly the kind of reading everybody's downvoting the previous comment for applying to goons.  If you could come up with some evidence, I'd be more convinced.  Otherwise it's clearly just an argument based on fear and emotion.
---
prospect is for gas-mining. not the endurance
---
That doesn't set it apart from either of the other 2 ships.
---
It is known
---
Why did I spend a whole goddamn hour on this
---
If eve gets around 5k players (thats 1k humans) that can only be more healthy for the server.
---
It would be epic to have another great war start, if these sorts of numbers join, we'd have conflicts all over the map.
---
No doubt it was awful, but you should at least link it if you want to bring it up out of the blue like this lol
---
Who the fuck let the BL pubbie out of his cage?!
---
There isn't really anything that juicy, even back-channel Brisc stays pretty civil.  The worst you'll probably get on Brisc from there is commenting in the NSFW channel or bitching about politics or little league.
---
You are right. The general status of Serenity isn't a well known, documented and factual situation. I need to prove to you that my statement isn't a one off racial stereotype /s... fuck out of here with thinking I need to convince you, random internet dude, about a concern of mine.
---
Endurance is for ice mining. Otherwise there’s no point. But I see them used to mine ice in wormhole space, not sure elsewhere.
---
PIBC, the entity who controls most of Nullsec on Serenity, recently announced their migration to Tranquility, reportedly to finish off their enemies who ran to TQ in both Winter Coalition and Ranger Regiment.
---
Expedition Frigates, not Exploration Frigates
---
Thank you.
---
Perhaps the reason they migrated the chat system is so that they can more easily filter it for Chinese players and this is all part of a CCP masterplan :tinfoil:
---
Same thing
---
your not wrong
---
What’s PIBC?
---
This is an issue with bots, as I have since understood.
---
There are ways to deal with bots. You just have to implement them.
---
- upon positive confirmation that an account is a bot do:
---
- for all characters on that account, set the skill points to ‘0', set the wallet amount to '0’.
---
- flag these accounts with a script, have the script run ever [n time] what the minimum amount of time is to spool up to having enough skill points to run the equipment. Then reset them to ‘0’ again.
---
- flag all characters on that account as -5 security so that they can be destroyed by any passerby at will without the risk of being Concordokken
---
- “But these are all Alpha accounts, they’ll just make new ones!” Sure they will. To operate a specific module [to be determined] for maximum output, that module can no longer be used on Alpha accounts, they’ll have to buy an Omega account.
---
- For any account flagged as a bot, reprocessing costs are now [whatever they were before]+75%, irrespective of where reprocessing takes place.
---
There is a finite amount of frustration and annoyance people will accept for doing something they know is detrimental. There is also the concept of learned helplessness: we know there’s no point in resisting, they’ll just keep doing it again, and again, and again, and again. Nobody persists ad infinitum in the terminally pointless.
---
Nope, not at all. Expedition Frigates is a specific class of ship and only includes the Endurance and Prospect.
---
question. if we mention a certain date and a certain massacre, will it auto disconnect everyone from china?
---
For mining things other than Gas?
---
I dunno, not a miner. Just throwin out the only use case I can think of.
---
It's important to say that CCP has to moderate their gsme--otherwise we're literally having a race war in EVE...  but if you think about it, plex prices reaching 10b would be 3x their current price.  We're already at 10x their price from when the gsme was "healthy" (and there were more bots/person back then too) and most people would agree if we could fix a few issues, EVE would be more or less doing fine.  Thinking about it relative to people's incomes and to the amount of isk destroyed is the key.  The problem now is that 10x as much stuff does not die compared to 2006, but that's as much or more about pvp balance as it is about the economy.  Pretty simply, if people are still buying plex feverishly at 10b/500, the game is doing fine as long as shit still dies.  So, it's on CCP to moderate botting and cheating, but also to balance their game and incentivize destructive play.
---
Shiiiiit and I have been stock piling for the opposite. Great... 10,000 plex and now its about to be worthless. 
---
Fuck me.
---
Which is the sort of thing that makes people not prevent their rental space sov from being taken
---
They are not
---
Not the same as "they don't care" though.
---
no theyre not
---
&gt; ne storage and hopping. Running an astrahus for each clone might be annoying, but better than waiting 2/3 of a day every time you want to switch specialized activities, roll boosters, or jump into
---
This. I've filtered out Refineries and complexes entirely just to net have to deal with it.
---
It's actually the exact same thing.
---
if by worthless, you mean, 7x the current value, then yes: totally worthless.
---
Baghdad Bob? Is that you? Its been so many years...
---
&gt; lol it was culturally acceptable in Goons for ages
---
As factually questionable as that statement really is, even if goons spent fucking years botting that doesn't mean we want another group coming in and doing it again.
---
endurance is the only ice-mining ship capable to jump frigholes apart from the porpoise
---
No.
---
Just no.
---
And you so clearly have zero idea what you  are talking about its painful, but keep projecting if it makes you feel better.
---
These are three very hard rules. No One Rental Scams. Period. End of sentence. We've had people ask if they could skirt one of these rules by offering a scam service to remove someone from being blacklisted, and the thread was dog piled by directors explaining that even though technically it was *just* withing the rules, it was still  close enough to impersonating a director or a diplomat that it would almost certainly end poorly for the scammer. 
---
It doesn't even make any fucking sense. According to Reddit, our directors are all scamming, but also skimming off of the top of our rental empire? Why? Why would we scam a billion isk when we could just rake in a constant stream of rental income whilst simultaneously denying our enemies income.
---
I know everyone on Reddit who isn't in Goons likes to endow our leadership with these mystical powers of deception and machination, but seriously, our directors are either too busy, too lazy or don't even log in to care about some piss ass scam. We're pretty one-dimensional as an organization.
---
Tell me how bad this sounds:
---
upon positive confirmation that an account is a bot do:
---
for all characters on that account, set the skill points to ‘0', set the wallet amount to '0’.
---
flag these accounts with a script, have the script run every [n] time what the minimum amount of time is to spool up to having enough skill points to run the equipment. Then reset them to ‘0’ again.
---
flag all characters on that account as -5 security so that they can be destroyed by any passerby at will without the risk of being Concordokken. Hunting parties for these jokers is going to be the new EVE thing to do.
---
“But these are all Alpha accounts, they’ll just make new ones!” Sure they will. To operate a specific module [to be determined] for maximum output, that module can no longer be used on Alpha accounts, they’ll have to buy an Omega account. Now they have to pay for the privilege [don’t fucking count on it].
---
For any account flagged as a bot, reprocessing costs are now [whatever they were before]+75%, irrespective of where reprocessing takes place.
---
They didn't have to. It already was a thing long before you came around all mad n shit about it.
---
You cared enough to reply
---
Great fights and great flying! I especially enjoyed the legion ;)
---
Isn’t there a furry Corp in TEST?
---
Jesus dude you're all over the place. 
---
1. If they're RMTing, CCP aren't getting any money, so, they wouldn't want to let them go.
---
2. If they're using the credit card, why are they botting?
---
3. If they're botting, why are they using a credit card?  It's money in or out, not both.
---
Let me reiterate CCP DOES NOT MAKE MONEY OFF OF CHEATING.  They are BAD about banning bots but it is not in their interest to let bots run wild, because rmt isk will always be cheaper than their plex.  The very economics of it are such that if it's worth it for the botter, they are making MORE MONEY selling isk than they are spending on plex.  That's money that CCP is losing.
---
They will start from scratch.
---
Dude they already permaban bots, it doesn't matter because they just make a new one. I don't get how you think that flagging a bot account makes any difference to the next one they spin up to replace it.
---
Monolithic if factual
---
Pretty sure that is what quantum computing is all about.
---
It sounds like they vpn around their govt firewalls so sadly no
---
Neither do Mittens, Progod, Noraus, Gobbins, Sort.......(insert bloc leader) lol
---
Aside from the eve-specific evidence that Serenity, a server populated by design almost entirely by Chinese players, presents with the raging RMT and the value of their ISK, you can look at any other game where chinese groups are common and you'll usually be able to find a fair few complaints about chinese bots/rmt/aimbots and so on. You can stick your head in the sand and claim it's sterotypes if you want, but that's not really going to change anything.
---
More than that but I doubt anything would change your mind about the CSM so it's pretty moot.
---
I have an issue with bots as much as i dislike multiaccounting or the chinese, so please let them have their own personal Hell on their server.
---
Delete your reddit account
---
&gt; They will do everything to survive, even cooperate. If they wont then it may become another serenity. 
---
I mean... Serenity is in the state it is literally because everyone cooperates (in a sense "cooperate or die") with PIBC.
---
PIBC is already cooperating with Goons where relevant. If they move to TQ fully, it's not going to be an independent force, they will be bluetrals with Goons.
---
The rest of EVE has already cooperated together in the last big war a year ago, it wasn't enough *anymore* to break through Goons. With PIBC piling on...  well, EVE was nice while it lasted.
---
Isn’t that horribly inefficient though?
---
I wouldn’t ban them, I would annoy them.
---
Annoying people works better.
---
Also, you disregarded the bit where I say that some of the equipment they use for maximum output can no longer be used on an Alpha account [we’d have to figure out what that equipment would be].
---
Increase the costs to where it’s no longer worth the effort. If it turns out that there’s still some margin of usability, increase the cost further.
---
What do you mean?
---
This may be just to push i need to quit... Again... For the fourth and **final** time.
---
You don't need to know anything at all about Eve politics to know that people will band together to protect their own interests. Let's say PIBC appeared and offered to join Legacy, do you think they would be turned away because content, or welcomed because they bring a shitload more people (weird timezone coverage is a bonus) and a shitload more income and security?
---
Could program a bot to do that
---
The Endurance is one of the coolest named ships in the game. Named afte Shackleton's Endurance ship that got stuck in the ice on an expedition to the south pole. Other than that...
---
&gt; ust to be safe, you really ought to avoid talking about the Tienanmen Squ
---
My safety is red. I'm almost certainly going to work Tienanmen and Xi into a local post.
---
Are you saying you're a wormholer but you don't use NS connections to explode shiny shit :thinking:
---
fucking hilarious thing is, unless PIBC players from china somehow find a way to have a legit bank account outside of china without Chinese officials fucking them up for doing so, theyre gonna have to fund their game time with PLEX.  
---
So ironically the more they bot the fuck out of TQ the longer it'll take for them to pay for 1 month of game time! i find that quite poetic!  
---
Yes itll be fucking horrific for anyone using plex for game time but it'll be the age of credit card warriors beating down on bots and players who rely on plex for game time.
---
Goons already do that anyways init man.
---
Fw space. I'm in amarr FW and I generally get 2-4 solo fights per day. You get to know the locals, know their fits, know who will always blob or which obvious bait is obvious (and if you chose to spring, what the response is gonna be like.)
---
Frigs are good for solo because the fights are over fairly quick which minimizes exposure to blobs.
---
Kiters (exec, slicer, tristan, condor...) are good because they can often disengage by just overheating mwd.
---
Half of winning a fight in eve is to pick a matchup that is winnable. I see a lot of noobs just throwing a ship at anything and then being like "no good solo fights."
---
It takes a while to know the common ships and the common fits. Some common ones:
---
Condor: light missile kiter with mwd. If you scram it, it dies.
---
Slicer: kiter with pulse (20km) or beam (lol 50km). Pulse is more dangerous as it's easier to fly but good beam pilots are deadlier.
---
Tormentor: Beam fit kiting at scram range. Watch for dual web fit and warp off when that doesn't go well. If you fly beam, carry Xray crystals for web kiters.
---
Merlin: These days, dual web, armor repping, structure tanked blaster is the cool meta, they have lackluster dps for a blaster boat but great range control. You still see a lot of medium shield extender ones, they are easy to kite because slow.
---
Atron: blaster gank fit, most dangerous at 0 on a plex warpin. Pull a tiny bit of range and the bads (void user) will drop dps a lot. Pull more range and antimatter drops off. They rarely switch to null unless really good so at 8+ km they are basically harmless.
---
Incursus: Really strong armor active tank was popular but most of those fit suffer from short range and terrible range control. Outdps'd by Atron, fairly slow but tanky af.
---
Punisher: Always bait. Occasional surprise kiter but generally just a giant ball of ehp. Bait fit get \~20k ehp.
---
Worm: OP as fuck solo. Popular fit has \~17k ehp, most of that shields. Drones are comparable to a tristan's in dps and overall tank (but only 2 of them at a time so deceptive.) Very often blingy best avoided.
---
Garmur: Rocket is a really good brawler and not too expensive (70-80m or so, almost always T2 fit). Kiting ones are loot pinata if you can scram them or uncatchable otherwise. Lots of them will fly blingy pods to and do easily 5k m/s before hear.
---
Kestrel: These days almost always dual webs rocket scram kiter. If shield buffer they will not have a point, warp off if you're not hitting. If armor, well, they are not very tanky so if you can apply you might win dps race.
---
Rifter: sucks generally. Arty kiter is interesting. AC + big plate + repper is slow and works best if they get a scram at 0.
---
Slasher: Kiting fit very very thin. Good candidate for a Tracking Disruptor and close orbit. Neut very useful. Underestimated. That said, one of the most common version you'll see if the medium shield extender, point, mwd, no gun fit flown as disposable tackler by "elite pvper". See Jake Stutta for the canonical example.
---
Comet: Blaster is a great brawler. Rails is a frigate killer extraordinaire, especially with dual webs (but in that case, warp off if you can.)
---
Firetail: Most popular fit is dual web with artillery. A very solid fit. AC fit are not nearly as good but can be very fast, easy to kite ACs however if they're not fast enough.
---
Tristan: Hard to quantify. Nano kiter is most popular and they go between 2500 and 3500 m/s cold. Neut fits are a real threat at 0 on plex warp in if you're in a cap dependent ship, you have 15 seconds to pull 8km on them or risk capping out. There are dual rep fits and blaster / rep fits that can shock you with dps. Non kitey Tristan have poor range control, they're slow and generally cannot fit a web.
---
How do you intend to fund this novel?

It's the existing powerhouse that PIBC will flock to so they don't feel they've lost power. 
---
They're going to make great pets.
---
And conveniently enough for our PIBC friends, CCP recently changed the recruit link so you can make a viable krab VNI char day 1 with the free SP. All they have to do is buy the ship and get to work turning TQ into mini serenity
---
&gt;Isn’t that horribly inefficient though?
---
Yours is even less efficient.
---
\&gt;Also, you disregarded the bit where I say that some of the equipment they use for maximum output can no longer be used on an Alpha account \[we’d have to figure out what that equipment would be\].  
---
This is already a thing, you are heavily restricted as to what you can fly and use as an alpha account in case you didn't know. Doesn't make a difference because it's still "free" isk income.

---
Can't stress this enough.
---
The real-world money they have waiting in the wings to pump injectors would stagger the mind. You pair that up with the fact they are a plague-in-numbers and it's just over...
---
There is a reason they are segregated from the rest of the community. Cheat, steal, lie... The Chinese way.
---
Imagine thinking you have to play EVE to read reddit
---
You'll notice I never mentioned stereotypes.  I did mention circunstantial evidence, which is the very definition of applying what happens on a second-rate server to TQ.  Do you really think CCP even tried to moderate Serenity, like they at least attempt on TQ?  IMO, if you want to claim this is a threat to the game, talk about Asian monetization culture--the idea that PA publicly announced they would put in BDO-style micros on Serenity, but not on TQ... and now we are getting a bunch of players who will put up with it.  That is a hard connection that worries me a lot.  As for the rest, we'll honestly have to wait and see.  Having more timezone diversity could help with these stupid timer mechanics CCP seems committed not to fix, and having more isolated groups with real power could break up the blue donut.  I have just as much evidence of that as you do that they'll cheat any more than EVERY other group in this game
---
I remember thinking "wow we are going through Guardians really quickly, we should be able to break...and now there are Apostles". Great fight friends, I'm looking forward to future brawls
---
for each alt account you unsub chinese players will create 3 new
---
How do they expect to be competitive without a year or more of constant botting/farming to get the skillpoints to fly supers
---
Spodumain. Not even once.
---
I second
---
&gt; Goons and NC.
---
So unrelenting autism with mild competence mixed with unrelenting docking without competence
---
That's really not a good way to describe a group that botted the shit out of their last server
---
lol
---
....i feel like i'm missing something, explain your reasoning.
---
Sure why not. Thirded.
---
I'd better to watch PIBC vs Russians!
---
haha, yep, I barely go to 0.0 (maybe once or twice a month ;) )
---
But I’m not the same as everybody else, I have a different outlook on things, if I was the leader of goons for example I would turn them away, id want wars, id want more people to shoot. 
---
Games are all about having fun, this game is all about war. Me personally I don’t care if I win or lose as long as I have a good time, now I would assume there is other people with this state of mind, but as I said I wouldn’t know because I haven’t been around long enough.
---
Weren't you trying to convince too...?  Sorry if you don't have a real response v0v
---
Darkness had a red pin last night to save a citadel being attacked by Snuff, who never showed, but Pandemic Horde, Northern Coalition, and a few others showed up to fight. Horde expected that we would be using Ishtars, we didn't, and in an attempt to bomb us, they bombed themselves and wiped out a large portion of their own fleet. I'm just asking if there's video of the event someone happened to record :)
---
Maybe re-think that phrasing.
---
It started getting updates again like a year ago, if development is ded again I'm unaware.
---
And to think some people say the solution is to remove local
---
Call it Tiananmen Square Invasion. 
---
You basically can fully control the narrative and propaganda since the other side cannot mention the name or they get removed from the internet.
---
If quantum computing has actually progressed to the point where it can defeat contemporary encryption, the planet's got a lot more problems than "racist children generating false positives on a state censor program."
---
&gt;They were securing the fort from the attackers you absolute mong... You and the OP state that the Fort was being attacked. So they probably waited out the timer until it was secure then came to you.
---
My original comment above, and your response below.
---
&gt; They already had, or did you forget to read the AAR? 
---
Implying that it stated it in the AAR. Which guess what it did not, as I point out.
---
&gt; It doesn't say anywhere in that, can you even call it an, AAR, that the Structure was secured.  
---
Now all of a sudden you did not say that? Jesus dude, alright, you haven't even got a clue what you're respondng anymore have you.
---
&gt; I never said the AAR said anything about the timer, 
---
I mean, I've argued with some absolute special cases before but at least they stick to one story and actually have any clue as to what their previous reply was. I'm sure you will figure it out at some point. I get that words are hard for you and all that jazz. I mean you are used to being a retard after all.

I was stating my own personal opinion and concern without the need for someone to agree with me. I don't need internet guys validation or agreement to have cogent thoughts or concerns. I'm sorry to burst your bubble, your opinion doesn't matter to me.

 is RL political something you really need that much in an online game?
---
I cant help myself but think of an orbital cannon everytime i see that thing.

&gt;this'll be fine because ccp do their job and aren't blithering imbeciles

haha yes!

Vodka and space ships, what could go wrong?

Haha yes!
---
Wat? :o
---
You create a new region in space. All the bots that are flagged are sent to that region in space. There is a jump gate that goes to that space, if you want to go there, but: you can never come back and your clones are in that region.
---
In that region there is one system with ore, it’s one ore belt. But: you can mine it without risk of rats, with a Rorqual :-).
---
That region of space runs on a blade server rom 2011, if three guys send out drones it becomes a slide show.
---
I wonder how long your bots will think that’s a pleasant idea.
---
Just post "Tiananmen square massacre 1989" and all the chinese will disconnect.
---
That sounds like myself, somehow I burned towards my bomb and got my own kill mail lol
---
All big battles must be called the Tiananmen Square Massacre no matter the outcome.
---
I suppose ignorance really must be bliss.

Nobody else owns a NPC station either, so if a Corp hangar is all you want you're better off just paying the NPC rental fee.
---
Lmfao imagine being such a drooling retard that you think Serenity alliances won't have any effect on TQ. Fuck off and come back when you understand how shit works.
---
I must say I am really just impressed you guys managed to refer to both the Preatorian guard and and the Excubitors in the same alliance name. How did the whole name come about?
---
goons just doubled in size
---
&gt;more content
---
yes bots are content yes very
---
shhhh it's going to be "worthless"..... /s we need to get the panic mongers to be loud so we can get those with a loose grip to relinquish their poorly cared for plex and thus increase my staggering wealth boom when the Chinese invade. 
---
It's like the 2007 real-estate market in china all over again. If I actually flew ships and did stuff in space I would be worried. But since all i do is read spreadsheets and make money...
---
I am elated that china is coming to town. Burn the server down I say.
---
Who? /s
---
The correct terms is scalie and that's only when we cosplay as dinosaurs.
---
Grr goons, etc
---
CCP don't do shit to solve botting here, why would it be any different with PIBC. PIBC and any other Serenity alliances coming over is a bad thing that'll result in ridiculous amounts of botting, not fun and engaging content.
---

---
It could theoretically make sense to see a fighter, since we have the Capital ship under construction, but I’m personally of the mind that it’s some sort of stationary weapon platform. A drone or fighter typically requires a highly maneuverable design, and long cylinders don’t typically lend themselves to that unless you can manage thrust angles *very* carefully.
---
Bad bot
---
Endurance can fit all 3.
---
Prospect can only fit two of the 3.
---
People don't want competition, they just want to stomp on people and rule them from their autism palace while they bot (goons) or do other undesirable things, that's why they blue each other around their SoV, that famous SoV map that gets updated and posted everywhere is a farce.
---
I know how an Alpha clone works, thank you very much.
---
You’re not reading what I’m saying [or likely: you don’t care, which is your right].
---
The point is: even for batters the universe is not free. There are costs to everything. A miner that can’t use a T2 module cannot possibly mine all that much. And every cycle counts. To make that worth your while you’d have to have thousands of mine bots. Is it really worth that much to them?

Come to wormhole space, you will see Prospects all the time. The ability to warp cloaked is a massive thing.
---
Swap clones without the timer.
---
Well I appreciate what you're doing. I have my own opinions about its interpretation but it's nice seeing others. 
---
Also. I was never this much into the lore until the triglavians started appearing. It's something about this storyline and it's cryptic nature that lures you in. 
---
For me, I like a good puzzle and this is the most challenging one in eve. It's more than just fly here, do a Cosmo mission and only a brief intro to an ancient civilization. I'm pretty sure that the triglavians are learning everything they can about the current political situation of all persons they interact with. 
---
They released their findings about the factions in empire space last week, this week they are trying to figure out some jovian history and i cant wait to see what's released later in the week. 
---
The amount of communication is also increasing. It was one time a week, then two and now 3 emails in 5 days. 
---
My bet is that the triglavians are following the old strategy of the ancient jovian. Learn everything you can, no matter the cost. Learn who is truly your enemy and who can assist you (capsuleers being the latter), plan your strategy, build the necessary equipment and only then launch an attack. 
---
Tinfoil hattery ensues from here. 
---
The triglavians are not the enhedduani, they are not the jovian that left the soct in charge of their legacy, and they are not the talacon. I believe they were one of the group's that originally after the collapse of the first empire. They seem to be aware of the second empire at least on some level but definitely not the third. They are not talacon because, unless I'm completely off, the talacon were before the jovian and had no direc5 interaction. I'm thinking that the triglavians splintered off from the beginning of the second empire or shortly before it and escaped the jovian disease by diving into what we call the abyss. The drifters are the second empire jove, were aware of what they did and used us to get to them. We did align the nexus gate after all in the drifter hive. This led to the triglavians being invaded by the drifter forces and now they need help to get rid of it. I'm thinking that near the conclusion of the invasion world tour, the triglavians will invade k-space. Instead of having to fight them i think you will be offered a choice. Either fight with the triglavians against the drifters or against the triglavians. 
---
I don't know what the ramifications would be of each decision but I'm excited.
---
Well it really seems like it, which is honestly unfortunate. I don’t see how the leaders are having fun with that, unless as you said they’re running their isk farms and probably what, rmting? Lol
---
Now that you mention that, I realized. TEST and Goons seems to be enemies and dislike each other, yet I’ve witnessed them fight on the same side during PH/Frat battles.
---
There will always be workarounds, but if you make it difficult and expensive to circumvent, it WILL cut down on the numbers. 
---
It’d be neat to build in functionality to suss out the computer’s actual geographic location, checking system language, time zone setting, installed programs (different demographics would likely have recognizable patterns), stuff like that. Enormous overreach, huge privacy issue so it would never actually be feasible, but it’s still cool to imagine, since I’m trying to go into cyber security.
---
That's a very strange way of being your own boss... Lol

Omg that's why it's an ice miner

I mine ice with Endurance, not Rorqs.  One Endurance is about 1 excavator.  What I like about them you can GTFO pretty very quickly.  I don't like feeding and I need to fuel my ships so these things are ideal.
---
Tri was still part of drf when drf helped legacy, legacy helped drf until only xix was left and is still helping them get back on their feet
---
You bring up something where test has shown themselves to be pretty great allies
---
Oh nah I get it, I'm the same kind of mindset really. But alliance leaders are a different mindset entirely, especially null blocs, and I can sort of understand it despite it being super anti-fun to me personally. 
---
Let's say for example PIBC asks to join Legacy and Legacy turns them away. Now PIBC and all their fleet numbers and income generation can spin a narrative against Legacy, which makes them friendlier to forces hostile to Legacy. You see the deal? If one group says no, they're allowing the benefits that would have went to them to go to their enemies instead.
---
It's pretty dumb and not fun, but that's pretty much nullsec in [current year].
---
&gt; Chinese officials fucking them up for doing so
---
WTF I love Chinese Authoritarianism now
---
"Any effect" and no control what so ever in botting with one alliance basically controlling all of NS so that everyone krab and bot like crazy are 2 different things.
---
hope you guys are ready for terrible players and an even more terrible economy o7
---
*tinfoil hat on*
---
Maybe that's why PIBC is making the move
---
I mean, I can read the description of the ship. I don't see a lot of people having a huge need to fit frigs through holes to get ice, though.
---
yeah, my bad
---
Endurance has 50% reduction in ice mining cycle time.
---
I have lived in Wormhole space for the last few months. I've never seen one. I use Ventures because they cost 3mil and at 3mil a pop, cloaking is worthless.
---
Rigght, now that you put it this way I completely understand your point and kinda clears up things for me..
---
So basically if we don’t let them join us and increase our power bloc, they will join somebody else and we will miss out. I see how it is, well I really do hope things change, I’m pretty sure a big Eve world war would bring a lot of people back, specially if tidi can be somewhat fixed with the 64bit client...
---
Slippery penis
---
Expedition Frigate is a specific class of ship. It is not the "same thing" as anything other than itself. The Endurance and the Prospect are the only Expedition Frigates. The Heron is not one.
---
This game really does try its best to keep me away huh.
---
That will be the name once the Indians Invade bigtime.
---
Imagine thinking that people buy supers off the market.
---
and bots, many bots
---
You realize that you proved the value of prospects by your comment, right?
---
They warp cloaked.... so you never see them.
---
Ship names too...
---
This is the end of Wakanda
---
You can easily hit the value of isk by botting the shit out of one region. We already have virtually no control over botting because CCP are fucking useless. Your ignorance does not in fact change how things work.
---
Prospect makes a great disposal blops hunter
---
The unreleased pylon that's sitting in the eve database supports your opinion.
---
You should have put this shit in your first post because at least more convincing.  The first shit you rattled off is inconsequential to owning a citadel in high fucking sec.
---
I would mostly expect people to be somewhat interested in EVE politics if they are nullseccers and mean it at least remotely seriously. EVE politics is in my opinion much more interesting than say Game of Thrones, because GoT is a product of one mind, whereas EVE politics is the closest thing to the real life (including cultural differences, bonds and ties tracing back for years, old wounds, realpolitik turned to eleven). I WAS THERE during 9-4 battle for PH Keepstar, I WAS THERE when Judge flipped the CO2 Keepstar to Goons, I WAS THERE when...etc etc. I wasn't there in Westeros; it's the story of someone else.
---
But in order to understand EVE politics you often need to know the history, so that you can see where the love or the hate stems from. Why Goons hate CO2? What's between Brave and TEST? Why NC. always fights Goons? Who are Russians aligned with, and those not utterly dumb may even ask - which Russians out of 3-4 main groups? The response could be often traced years back.
---
So PIBC is not a new kid coming out of nowhere. Far before they decided to move, they already aligned themselves with someone. The very same thing is true for Fraternity composed mostly of their enemies and therefore loosely aligned with The North, and these old wounds and allegiances are the reason I can quite safely predict that at the very best we will have another "we are totally independent" coalition of The South, maybe not even being nominally a part of Imperial Legacy and maybe even having some occasional skirmishes with Goons/TEST amongst others, just enough so that their FCs don't quit over boredom.
---
*tinfoil suit on*
---
Maybe that's why CCP tripled recruitment link SP
---
I've caught and killed plenty of none AFK people in ventures, it's easy. And then they get podded out. Prospects in the other hand...
---
Prospects and ventures are all over high class in vitals and instrumentals.
---
&gt; I've never seen one.
---
Maybe because of 
---
&gt; The ability to warp cloaked is a massive thing
---
;-)
---
Wrong.
---
Maybe you aren’t really concerned by their use, but Endurance and Prospect get a lot of love in wormhole space, where a covert ops cloak (or even a prototype cloak without speed penalty) is great to avoid hidden enemies.
---
Since the only ice sources in Anoikis are packed in Shattered systems, and that wormholes have mass limits, you can’t just move an ice mining fleet around like nothing. That’s where the Endurance shine : if you pair it with, let’s say, a Porpoise (if you’re sure you won’t meet any hostiles), you can make a nice revenue with the ice you mine.
---
Concerning Prospect, it’s basically a Venture on steroids. You get the same gas huffing capabilities, but a second mining yield bonus tied to the Expedition Frigates skill, plus the improved ore hold and cloak.
---
They’re not to be used everywhere, and anybody with three neurones connecting will see that the Barges have a better mining yield. However, if you need to harvest ressources while unseen (which is the whole point behind Expedition Frigates), then looks no further.
---
Cooperation between leadership to generate inorganic content just to keep the people logged in, but the objective is meaningless.
---
yeah doesn't take long when you bot lol
---
&gt;  We already have virtually no control over botting because CCP are fucking useless. 
---
They banned thousands of accounts in the first quarter of the year and confiscated a large enough amount of money so much that it was visible on the MER. I doubt the chinese are use to even the basic amount of control CCP has.
---
Even my ass is more elite
---
So will there be a coordinated effort to constantly fuck with them?

If not I'm disappointed

If CCP had taken Dust 514, modernized the graphics and balanced a few things before releasing it on PC it would have become bigger than Planet Side 2.

I agree that the Triglavians are probably a Jovian Splinter, and that they aren’t one of the Splinter groups we were already aware of, though I think it’s neither here nor there whether they splintered off during the First or Second Empire.
---
From what we know, especially considering their statement of intent to “test” us Capsuleers, Information-gathering is most likely their primary goal right now. Whether we’re responsible for their current conflict with the Drifters or not, we’re currently embroiled in a three-way free-for-all and the Triglavians seem completely unaware of how the situation got started, or of anything else that’s been going outside of Abyssal Deadspace since before the collapse of the Second Empire.
---
We have a choice, alright: the Triglavians, it seems, may be interested in an alliance against the common Drifter threat, but humans aren’t always good at alliances. Who’s going to build bridges, and who’s going to burn them?
---
Yeah bois
---
Well I have better luck.
---
Sorry, already did...
---
You realise they can take numbers from people quitting or spare accounts no longer being used and just say that's bot bans, right? And even assuming their stats people are 100% truthful and accurate (hi ccp "260m ticks" quant) it wasn't that hard for them to inject fresh bots after being banned, now you can have a day 1 VNI alt using recruitment link SP. CCP won't do shit until it's more profitable to actually deal with botting than it is to have the bots around

---
Just to clear up a bit prospect is great for c5-6 gas sites because they can dodge the sleepers pretty much indefinitely. That and the cloak. 
---
Never flown the endurance.. I figure its only use is wh ice mining and thats kinda a shame. As anywhere else you want a barge.
---
My issue's with the prospect is its just a blingy venture with a cloak... if it had an extra high for a probe or a real buff to gas yield I personally would use it a lot more. But honestly unless your ninja huffing c5-6 gas use a venture. No point in risking 20-30m on a t2 hull if its the same as the t1.
---
Think if the hulk just got more tank instead of more yield/range.. Like thats absurd right? I fly a skiff for that. 
---
The only other use is covert cynos which is just a lame use of them in the first place.. Emergent game play is cool but when it takes better suited ships out of the running its not...

i'd suggest the book or audio book Empires of EVE to see the game from 2003 to 2009, as the players developed and empires emerged. ideologies clashed, and the game changed.

its a great read. and you can get the first 1/3 of the book free on a podcast App

this covers the Venal Civil War and Great Northern Wars.  wars that put controlled space(only corp mates/alliance mates) vs free space(free to enter space) ideologies and cultures.   and saw players grow from small corps to alliances to the creation of one of hte strongest entities EVE ever saw.

The time they splintered off doesn't really matter from a tech or strategic standpoint but I'm interested in when they splintered just because "history of new eden". I find it fascinating. 
---
You're right that capsuleers alliances are shaky at best and i think that in the end, it will be a standings sort of thing. I just don't know what positive standings woth triglavians would mean or if it would mean amything at all.
---
Bad Bot, it's for a study.
---
CCP - Chinese Communist Party or CCP the game developer?
---
nice example of someone who does not understand how life is actually works.
---
hint: every fucking single one plex ingame WAS BOUGHT from CCP for REAL MONEY, it does not even matter if whole alliance will be using ingame isks to buy them all to plex their botting army
---
but yeah am all over the place, right
---
we Reeeeeed long enough back then, as this option should only be for a short time but they left it in game
---
Porqué no los dos?
---
Have you seen what the bots that *already* moved over from serenity last year have done? 
---
I went into a system yesterday with 30+ identical chinese alts botting. It's not just EVE, it's every game. It's a cultural difference: their goal is not fun or "honor" in winning, it's to win at all costs, regardless of how you do it. 
---
Actually I am the one who send this ping...
---
Fairly nice translation.
---
This comment is utter idiocy.
---
If you think the EVE community is full of liberals, on Reddit or elsewhere, you're dreaming.
---
Signed, 
---
A Liberal
---
So 24% sure hes a bot. Thats a high number maybe
---
We don't know that yet. But I am sure Pipebomb will.
---
B.) not if they want pvp and they're in your plex for pvp. Sure you can be in point range if you want to ensure kills against double web no AB shit fits but then you're pretty much auto dead against some mwd blaster fit if you're AB for example.
---
E.) it's extremely helpful for manual orbiting in alt-2 camera mode and for reasons already explained above.
---
F.) why not just match your speed manually and avoid a 70% certain death to any good slingshot? Using keep at range at such ranges is pure suicide.
---
I was hoping you'd actually mention the relevant thing aka the best way to manually kite is the alt-1 tactical camera since it gives you a better relation understanding of the grid and doesn't require empty space on the sides of your screen, but it's much more confusing and easy to make mistakes in than the method I described. If you want to become really good you'll have to learn it eventually.
---
*heavy breathing*
---
Does this mean rnk might come back? Lol
---
Can someone send me the logs for nostalgia purposes? Totally not because of the NSFW channel... legit though...
---
I will do it for 9b isk.

Yeah I looked that up, most of the walkthrough sites think that's probably a long-standing unfixed bug lol.

Stay woke fam..

The only BPOs in there are a few small and medium ammo BPOs.  The post was sent out by a person who thought the citadel was abandoned, as from the KB for one that was caught, they occasionally go looking in W space for abandoned Citadels
---
Brisc was a liberal lobbyist...
---
Literally winning with local spam. TEST pilots have been training for this day since they started playing.
---
I thought the money was in gas huffing
---
There's a huge spectrum of organizational culture in EVE, but it's relatively stratified between non-pvpers, groups that pvp, but it's not their only focus, and then groups who only pvp.  There are pretty big differences in acceptable behavior between those groups.
---
All you need is to believe. Trust m boy. (c) Catholic priest
---
7800+ bots. That’d be impressive.
---
Man children
---
Is it possible that are “core pockets”, so to speak, of completely stable Abyss space? Pockets where the Collective can live sedentarily, rather than in nomadic Troika?
---
Positive standings would, hypothetically, either mean being recognized as friendly by Triglavian installations in K-Space, should they indeed invade, or inside those theoretical “core pockets” of the Abyss, which could open up when things escalate further with the Triglavians.
---
Funny thing, this Parallux guy sounds like almost like Vily
---
Yay even more people to one of the two sides /s
---
Now what I would love to see is them building up for themselves, so that there's more than goons, test + pets vs panfam, frat, etc.
---
The only thing I can say is the nda prohibits them giving us said evidence.. But yes THEY have the power to break the nda in the first place.
---
 I think its ridicules that the csm is expected to be under NDA when they are there to fucking advise them as players. I understand some of these meetings may detail more business than game but thats on CCP what they disclose. The csm shouldn't basically be prohibited from talking to their constuants *fuck auto correct* because of said NDA because ccp said how much plex sell or whatever they tell them were not allowed to know.
---
Frankly its absurd. Im tired of game companies asking for player assistance then slaming an NDA on them when we offer it. World of tanks did the same thing with its super tester program ffs im sure my friend vialated his when we were talking about it ffs.. NDA's are just dumb from a game standpoint. We need to talk we need to share ideas. The reason why caps are busted is because ccp didnt fucking listen in the first place.
---
WALL. NOW.
---
&gt;Winnie the Pooh
---
lmao, I forgot about that
---
It turns out that TEST will save us all in the end.
---
We'll build a wall, a great wall
---
Why not trying to find where those isk are going and take sanctions against the alliance or pilots receiving them ?
---
Eh, poor attempt at a joke on my part.
---
We sacrifice monthly a gallente shuttle filled with exotic dancers, wine and 1 nuplex at the sun in our wormhole as a gift to Bob.

I mean, in reality the whole server could just band together to bully them. That’s probably what’ll happen too.
---
pretty much that's the plan :D
---
Boy oh boy, did you ever pick the right game to study. See the post recommending *Empires of EVE* for more details.
---
Only if they get to ride the coat tails of whoever comes out on top and get to claim they were the strategic masterminds behind Titan blobbing
---
Do you ram it with a Stabber?
---
Chinese government is scum, as are any of the trash humans that support it
---
So if you or I were a dick sucking enthusiast who had some great times sucking dicks, but then we stopped sucking dicks because dicks just don't taste like they used to (or whatever), but we still enjoyed hearing stories about sucking dicks as it brought back fond memories of all those great dicks we sucked, it's still doesn't change the fact that we're no longer sucking dicks.
---
Your PH overlords were involved, too. Imagine that.
---
Is anyone working on Evemon right now or is it in another lull?  The one I'm seening hasn't been updated since February, and I can't seem to use the implant calculator.  Just curious if there is another one someone else is taking care of now or if it's just been a while since it updated.  (Just recently came back so not sure).
---
Nope, delve can fit more players
---
Wanted to buy weapons, after three days of negotiations and moonshine spirits I ended up married to a girl that doesn't speak my language and a small herd of sheep.
---
prospect has twice the capacity of the venture
---
More likely that some people will just up and quit the game. Sadly.
---
Lower sales as well
---
noemata is the plural of noema. It means "thought", vaguely.
---
Ritualistic murder is bad, mkay?
---
This is why I try to ask questions here and there when this type of subject comes up, and I really appreciate your post as all these type of replies give me a little insight of things..
---
I’m really interested in all of the Eve history that has to do with alliances and coalitions because I find it extremely interesting, however I don’t think I could ask a single person about decades of history as it will most likely be a very very long post..
---
And not pay any real money into the company 😆 Plex.going to cost 700 billion isk soon
---
Better than sacrificing a newborn for every rorqual alt such as happens in the dark recesses of delve.
---
Could they perhaps block the chat somehow? Not that it doesn't have a huge drawback.
---
It is funny your corp mate just got banned for cheating
---
So someone just needs to repurpose their rorq bots and we good.
---
Someone just snitched to government overlords.....can't play Eve from Chinese gulag. 😄
---
CCP - what?...........Oh yeah totally that was the idea
---
nice loki
---
I see you using Prom's music. :eyes:
---
Because of lifing an MMO is what normal people do.
---
Goons will ally with them, same with test, and they will continue what they started on serenity, most likely to after frat. That's my prediction
---
2 only reasons I used a prospect instead of venture :
---
1- biger cargo means more afk gas mining
---
2- tanking gas explosing in 0.0 gas anoms
---
for everything else there is the venture. mines as much for 3m isk fully fitted
---
There are prepaid VISA/MasterCard credit cards that almost anyone can apply and easily obtainable. Shopping abroad isn't a problem, it's the direct money transfer have restrictions as any country in the world. Tried to send some money into China not long time ago ended up with an email from my bank asking me to call a phone number.
---
PLA and their alt alliance are PIBC, as are quite a few other chinese corps in the cfc. Don't get your hopes up.
---
It's been updated several times since ESI to improve performance and stability. It's maintained rather than actively developed.
---
I can't remember where I read it, but it's been speculated that there are pockets of stable abyss space that the triglavians live. It's been translated in the emails from Friday that some capsuleers may be worthy to enter. Enter where? Who knows. But the speculation is stable abyss or perhaps enter into the clade.
---
Bots dont have rights
---
They have worked together in the past
---
That's to offset the -1 turret slot. It has the same mining capability as a venture with 1 turret instead of 2.
---
If you read *Threats* or *What the Sniper Saw* (later re-titled as  *Dig Two Graves* then you may remember Giselle Duluth.

Don't be a clinger, you just need a change of color for a time, not a complete new way. My corp has quite a few leavers which we usually release with all the best wishes. Sometimes they return, sometimes they don't. We don't really slam the door behind people.
---
Yeah, fuck that.
---
PIBC is already on TQ.
---
*already downvoted*
---
**It was just a prank bro**
---
When in doubt see rule #1.
---
Either way, alliances and territory-opening seem like a possibility.
---
But who's gonna pay for it?
---
So the cancer continues
---
Delve was already kinda densely packed when I lived there last year. And that was before the Anomaly spawn rate nerf.
---
Then again I hear Period Basis might be needing some occupants
---
If your only issue with Chinese players is cheating, that's something for the GM team to deal with.
---
If your issue is cultural, then you have far bigger personal issues. There's nothing wrong with them playing a game ruthlessly to win. I personally find winning fun, I would assume you are the same?
---
The word honor used by an eve player is a joke, every eve player hunts players who don't want to pvp or kill enemies with smaller hull/fleet size than their own. Diplomacy, alliances, trust and betrayal are all factors that make Eve fun.
---
Not every WH corp live in C2-C5/NS you know...
---
NS roaming can be fun (until the cyno) but WH hunting and WH pvp in general have a realy special tast.  
---
imo, there are shinyer thing to blow up in WH than NS aswell

You're welcome

Already saved. Cheers brothuh. TEST local autism shall save TQ

Some people mentioned empires of eve but, oh boy, is that lacking short if you want to know the culture. You can easily fill a book with eve online alone. I'd say scamming and Jita local is good for one paper on its own. Just search a bit for scams (recently somebody described on this reddit how a RL friend scammed him.) But be aware that is only a very small part of eve culture.
---
Another paper could be on the CSM and everything connected to it...
---
Then all the bigger groups have their own culture.
---
did i say its not?
---
Fun with some new tech and overall changes to Trig stuff (prices of ammo as an example). Love that we get (hopefully) more lore and events with them.
---
Just don’t forget the tierside of the regular ships (CCPlease).
---
now you're signing me up to kill people with a hull I can't even undock yet jeez!
---
Guess we now know what got leaked by a Certain CSM Member. Explains the Price Hikes in alot of the Triglavian Items
---
You obviously haven't visited Hek or Rens, they make Diodixie look like a walmart on steroids
---
But why would they do that when they can use one against the other and win?
---
&gt; Seriously guys, Veles guns are supposed to be more expensive, what don't you get?!
---
- CCP
---
great¡ now these chinks gonna ruin tq for the rest of us. Region lock these commie faggots.
---
You're quite a bit less smart than you think you are.
---
Why are you in Goons if you disagree with their political stances? Or are you flair baiting?
---
Thanks for the 200m isk, I had a bet you wouldn't actually respond to my comment and instead try and spin it another direction. 
---
:)
---
It was just a joke, I guess. Since title says "you never asked for".
---
Just out of sheer curiosity, does anyone know what exactly are the current Chinese laws with regards to these matters ? 
---
Last time I read an article about it they either had or were talking about a limit of 3-4 hours of gaming per day per person or something like that and people were using VPNs en masse. This was obviously a few years ago. 
---
Now VPNs outside of the "approved" ones are illegal to use in China and I haven't heard anything about that hours limit recently at all. I'm very curious where exactly and precisely do these things stand.
---
You know PayPal exists in China right...?
---
If history repeats itself and they are truly moving en-masse, potentially.
---
Sisi.....
---
The Eve culture is a very toxic culture, be careful how deep you dig, you may not like what you find.
---
Geminate is usually where all the gudfight kids go. Building 20 cheap frigates and have them blown up in Faction Warfare is also a recommendable PVP learning experience. Other than that, you might try to get your highsec PVP feet wet with RedvsBlue.
---
I responded perfectly to your comment you blithering numbskull. If you can't fathon that out then you need serious help in understanding the English Language.
---
They aren't playing the game if a bot does it for them.
---
Food is #1 clearly ;-)
---
My issue is with cheating and bots. Don't try and make this about racism. I've got fuck all against the Chinese save that they believe botting to sin is ok.
---
Stop white knighting. This is a real fucking problem that CCP is utterly failing to keep up with.
---
The joke ——&gt;
---
You ————-&gt;
---
Man, if someone bought up a bunch of Faction and TII Disintegrators recently, they could have made some series bank.
---
Chai-nuh
---
You sir have been had.
---
we all knew this would happen, and this most likely doesn't come to a surprise to anyone in faction warfare.  It's been inundated with the Chinese for the pas 6 months.
---
Ah fair, well then it gets the cloak bonus and can fit cloaks more easily
---
...you mean more so then it already is? unimaginable...
---
Which alliance can I join to help smash these guys into the ground before it's too late? I wouldn't do this against any other group but these guys are known botters. If there's anything we don't need it's more bots.
---
&gt;For starters:  
---
&gt;Local.  Delay.
---
That will take only a small or negligible bite out of the whole situation, they will simply set up with a percentage of losses in mind. Use shit fits etc. Like right now, look at zkill, ratting carriers for 1.3 Bil. Some as low as 1.2 Bil but they start losing too much functionality. And this isn't even counting insurance or anything else. Unlike you and others hunting them down, they can stay logged on for 23.5 hrs per days, taking shifts and changing locations and anoms or activity type if need.
---
I am excited for the T2 Vedmak (the name escapes me). Maybe it will also give me a reason to fly the Zarzamad I've had in my hangar for the last month
---
u wot
---
This, need my weekly "cyka blyat" in Comms
---
Duck, stahp! He's already dead! XD
---
dont worry bud, we all like a pierced nipple, fuck these idiots.
---
What's dis?
---
So if they move to TQ do they have to start over with fresh clones or do they simply move their accounts?
---
&gt;balance their game and incentivize destructive play
---
It isn't just destructive play. It is a lack of active play. PvE wise there are too few things in the game that can't be done AFK or efficiently botted. Also, by default, any mechanics CCP impliments which support multiboxing, by default inadvertently support botting doing part of the work for them.
---
we are in the middle of mourning our dead alliance please be considerate during this hard time
---
Yeah, even if there was no history winning in eve is currently achieved by blueing the biggest fish. And not many alliances define winning for themselves as doing something really hard
---
They can't criticize the head honcho directly, so they criticize winnie the pooh (obviously referring to Mr head honcho instead).
---
They made buying skills from character sheet purposefully more expensive the book on the market. Trade off effort vs. convenience. Whether saving 1.5m is worth getting to a station that sells a book depends on how you value your ingame time and how far you'd have to go.
---
I used to be in a corporation of solo Frigate pirates and it helped to have Corp chat to vent to when being ganged up on and to share fits and experiences with. Not to be discouraging but FW and the whole game had more players around it back then. FW is the big empty now. I wonder why all those players stopped?
---
Asking the real questions
---
Not sure if flairbaiting or not
---
it is the one by peterhaneve correct?
---
https://github.com/peterhaneve/evemon/releases
---
This^ try to stay away from Goons and Goon related accessories if you like your innocence
---
apparently in this timeline VPNs allow piercing of the great firewall for eve but not for chat rooms
---
1. Perhaps issues w/ the relaunch?  afaik it was only supposed to be down a few weeks but it ended up growing to months? 
---
2. Serenity is within the great firewall so its still possible to play on it. the only problems were the lack of updates to both the game and the server infrastructure. But how does Frat play now? VPN. because of that they'll be able to play on an outside server 
---
3. OFC it could but given that several other sources said that they're hearing similar things its more than possible
---
I honestly wouldn't worry about it unless you see a competitor start trying to steal it. The odds of somebody trying to use a one man businesses logo to steal clients is pretty dumb. It might happen every once in a while but you've probably got at least 1,000,000:1 odds nobody will bother
---
I just did a setup for 3 alts using this: https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Colony_management#One_Planet_P0.3EP2_-_Commander_Center_Upgrades_IV
---
I'm extracting the most profitable p2 on each planet.
---
Only imlants a guardian might benefit from generally are probably powergrid implants.
---
Some groups in lowsec might want/require a mid-grade slave set but that would be clearly communicated as part of a doctrine. I'm thinking folks like maybe Snuffed Out.
---
Hey, OP! Evemail me (Makoto Priano) in-game and we might be able to sort something out. :)  
---
That said, folks, ARC is also buying all classes of Semiosis Conduction Consoles. Our current bounty can be found in the MOTD of channel Consortium Operations.
---
Can we keep the racism to ourselves?
---
You need Command Centre Upgrades V.  Get all the others up to 4 will be enough, with Interplanetary Consolidation V if you want to max out the number of planets you're using (6).
---
After that, experiment.  Try setting up a little factory, get the hand of the UI etc.  There are various guides on what you need to build what, etc.  Don't worry about making a bit profit for now.
---
&gt; Can we keep (...) to ourselves
---
lol I'm not gonna fall for that
---
For those of us that dont understand whatever language that is written...?
---
Ikitursa
---
&gt;  If you could come up with some evidence, I'd be more convinced
---
Even if you are actually stupid enough to ignore Serenity, google is difficult to use huh ? And no video game ever has been greatly affected by them to the point where some of them had to shut down completely.

They have to VPN anyway. It won't work.
---
Eve is a harsh and brutal game. Other players will blow up your shit just for fun, rob and scam everything off you, spy on your corp/alliance and stab you in the back given half the chance but that said... The community is probably the most brotherly and helpful bunch of nerds ever to exist online.
---
People will bend over backwards to help you if you're a noob (right after blowing you up of course). They will point you in the right direction, introduce you to people, give you ships and money or just chat and have fun.
---
This brotherhood extends to outside the game too. Having a shit time IRL? Capsuleers are there to provide support and pick you back up.
---
I love Eve
---
&gt; As should be expected, we will issue a full and frank apology for any mistakes for which we are responsible, as well as provide appropriate reparations to those affected by any erroneous actions we’ve taken.
---
CCP Jumped the gun it seems..
---
wow that’s a lot of words that say absolutely nothing
---
I mean.. might as well delete the storyline guns from the game, but whatever
---
The last paragraph says quite a lot.
---
You need to build your argument a little better. First you are labeling an entire country as cheats because of their culture and now your shifting the blame onto CCP, which is pretty much what i said with my ininital reply to you.
---
I completely agree with your final line. Botting is an issue that CCP need to deal with. Its rampant throughout Eve.
---
More like “If we jumped the gun, we will take restorative action”, but if you want to jump the gun yourself, be my guest.
---
Oh this looks good, thanks mr\_eti! Gonna study this up tonight
---
Awesome, I'm pretty sure I don't have any of those skills quite yet, so that's a rip on my part. I'll start training them up and check out the UI as well. Thanks buddy :)
---
Red light for 24 hours and you can't afford fuel now or what?
---
Not really: "for any mistakes we are responsible" if it was not a mistake that does not matter.
---
Apology tour is starting
---
read to the end i think for CCP it starts to look like that "Brisc did nothing wrong" but they want to recheck few times before issuing formal apology
---
The real question is: Why would they even post this?
---
It really doesn't though... it just says "if we fucked up, we'll apologize and give you your stuff back".
---
I pretty much figured that would be the case already
---
tl;dr Brisc should be getting a lot of free SP in 6 months to a year?
---
Lol, so typical of CCP. Total ineptness if true.
---
&gt;As should be expected, we will issue a full and frank apology for any mistakes for which we are responsible, as well as provide appropriate reparations to those affected by any erroneous actions we’ve taken.                      
---
Final paragraph from the "update" on the Brisc Rubal ban devblog
---
Sure, but until we get another update post in however much time that last paragraph has no actual substance.
---
CCP fucked up....no one seen that coming.
---
They only sacrifice the seal when they undock though.
---
The seal population has seen a significant increase in recent years.
---
This but unironically
---
&gt; We plan to issue a follow-up statement next week.
---
This is going to be good.  Just them talking about this, when they are usually so very tight-lipped regarding account actions, screams that they fucked up.
---
The fact that they posted this at all is why the statement has significance. This is effectively CCP apologizing in advanced.
---
for them it is
---
My wild guess is that at the end of next week he'll stay banned.
---
So are they going to unban pando?
---
Wonder if CCP Dopeybollocks will get canned.
---

I'm really new to EVE, and I'm not really sure what this is about ... why is everyone saying Rip PLEX? what is TQ? who is PIBC? "region-lock China"?

that might be so but i would have to watch the video to confirm

classic ccp
---
His original advice was shitty, until he recommended finding a corpmate or someone to take onto SiSi to test with. If you simply go on SiSi solo, the only places to find nerds to practise against are in the combat zones, and unless you convince someone to go elsewhere with you, a couple of nerds warping in on any fight in titans sort of ruins it.
---
Also, if you're practising with a standard fit, don't forget in the combat zone others are running max bling and implants, because it costs nothing. That's not really good practise either.
---
I'm not debating that it is fun, but I'm saying it's not the place to learn how to pvp.
---
Because the general public is revelling in the idea that this is another CCP fuckup, so they need to address it *somehow*, preferably in a reassuring manner. To the EVE community, however, I suspect reassuring intent comes across only as showing weakness.

4 chars, 20 planets across two systems, 18 P1 resource planets, and 2 factory planets that don't operate at full capacity because I don't want to setup another 10 planets on my other 2 chars.

it sounds like you're trying to get other people to research your assignment / PhD for you, to be honest

if you want to make an honest project and write genuine research, then do your homework and discover more about the game than it having "many cultures"

#freebrisc
---
I don't think RIP is enough for this guy, wow.
---
I'm amazed about that too. It's just feeding further speculation, the way it is worded now.
---
oof
---
Well, it's not like CCP enforces much of its anti-botting on TQ either...
---
Where is this "update"
---
This is a top tier troll for all the init players who got started and thought it was an announcement that pando/shines were unb&amp;
---
It took me a while to work out what it was optimal to build, which planets, how long to run the extractions for and so forth.  You'll pick it up with experience.  Your first few goes at it will be pretty rubbish tbh.
---
ccp admitting when they fucked up and coming out and saying so, this is a step in the right direction i guess.
---
Release the report CCP!
---
You think they wanted to address a public wildfire by fanning the flame? What part of the article reassures the public that their decision was the correct one?
---
So we have to name our ships that way, got it.
---
To me, this is kinda Doxxing, as you deliberately are trying to get the chinese readers into real life trouble.
---
That's generally how eve itself works anyway, so I'm quite used to that process. I've got my hands in most other aspects of EVE except PI so I definitely want to give it a shot.
---
Another shining star for CCP.
---
free stunt
---
Someone fucked up, this is going to be epic
---
I should have invested my plex into salt and popcorn before all of this went down.
---
LOL, yeah. When the hell did it become a bad thing to like porn in GODDAMN AMERICA. Like we're living in pinko commieville around here lately.
---
aar pls
---
Yes if they had a smoking gun they wouldn't have even hinted at that or done more investigation. It would've been a get fuckt from CCP if that was the case.
---
I think they tried to pour water on the fire, but didn’t realize their water bucket was actually full of gasoline.
---
never fear, reddit is blocked over here.
---
Where was the gigx interim statement and follow-up investigation though?
---
He's still standing there.
---
Yep. The fact that some form of investigation is on-going and they are ready to apologize effectively wipes away their previous actions - at least in regards to Brisc since his name was the one explicitly mentioned.
---
I tell you h'what.
---
This post is just here to start damage control, they already know they have fucked up.
---
So my friend bewalk gets perma banned, lost 6 accounts, like 2T isk, and he gets ZERO response from anyone from CCP. For years.
---
But because this fuck gets a bunch of angry reddit nerds he gets a fucking DEVBLOG about HIS BAN?
---
Fuck you CCP, and your inconsistent disrespectful actions towards your players.
---
How could you, INIT? Snuff had to shoot their own wrecks!  
---
Meanwhile, barely alive and clinging to life support, "pure blind madness" coalition pilots/bots were warping in ceptors, bombers, and caracals to loot what they could to make up for all the allies they have lost over the past 3 months. Apparently, endlessly running mission bots out of 5ZXX doesn't generate enough money for Tau's daily Brazilian wax job, so they have to resort to alternative isk sources to pay for all this snuff help in pure blind.
---
Leaving corp is not betraying people, wtf are you even talking about? Just keep in touch with whoever you want and meanwhile meat new people.
---
Besides "If leave I'll betray them, so I won't play at all" is just plain stupid... but hey, I'm sure your corpmates appreciate the loyalty of someone who isn't playing and doing usefull stuff for the group.
---
Finally CCP will apologize for stunt as well
---
&gt;Jita was chosen as the trade hub due to the high number of connections and easy access to the majority of the game.
---
Uh...no.
---
Jita had a lot of industry slots, back when those were a thing.  Jita and neighbors also had a good number of high-quality agents, back when agent quality was a thing.  Finally, Achura had better stats back when races and bloodlines were meaningful, so most players were Caldari.
---
So when Yulai lost it's superhighways, a lot of the market moved to Jita.  Amarr, Dodixie, Rens and Hek had similar benefits, so they became the local trade hubs for those races.
---
"players"
---
A primer for an excuse to me...
---
" As should be expected, we will issue a full and frank apology for any mistakes for which we are responsible, as well as provide appropriate reparations to those affected by any erroneous actions we’ve taken. "
---
of course stainguy shows up when someone talks about a lot of words that say nothing, he is the master after all
---
Yeah. Well if it does cause massive inflation and ruins large scale PvP then I don’t blame them. Skill injectors were a mistake, changing PLEX was a mistake, goddamnit.
---
&gt; But I welcome more content.
---
Hell, a "real" east vs "real" west war might get people to resub in droves.
---
I don't think that they would post something like this unless they somehow fucked up.
---
Great work, team!
---
**GUILTY**
---
*Until further notice. Trust us guys.*
---
Well brisc did make lots of noise with his own statement and Bill Clinton reenactment on TIS so maybe they're just keeping up appearances and taking a piece of narrative for themselves.
---
You're kidding right? The economy has been destroyed for years. Game time used to cost less than a hundred mil. Inflation of isk and mineral suppyy long ago destroyed this economy for the average person
---
Dudes on the CSM and this news it to cereal gaming news websites and can bite CCP in the ass. Your friend's ban didn't
---
&gt; **nor have I found any connection between the Grey Triggerfish and the term “Kostorg**
---
here you go : 
---
[https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostorog](https://hr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostorog)
---
I wouldn't read that much into it, theres been enough publicity all over the internet about it they may feel that some further "review" about this case is good PR. They would be right to feel this way.
---
The only thing that solves this is a zero tolerance, in-your-face ban effort by ccp that effectively ends it in any serious way. However ccp would have to hire a whole team to effectively achieve what amounts to then hacking a leg off their income stream. They may be botting...  but they are spending and expensive plex is good for their bottom line. 
---
Ugh.
---
doesn't read as in "if we fucked up" but more like " we fucked up"
---
And the obvious reason why they're saying that is to prepare for the " we fucked up, we'll apologize and give you your stuff back" post next week. 
---
Otherwise they wouldn't bother posting this.
---
i guess ill avoid these threads, thx for letting me know you don't give a damn
---
By 'region lock' they do not mean Detroid.
---
Credit cards and skill injectors.
---
City Wok.
---
It's pretty much just nature - fall into a school/herd and hide there so you probably don't  get consumed.
---
Either CCP really fucked up somehow or Ned bent the knee.

It might have been kneecapped, but this is a gangland execution.
---
I mean, it wasn't really required.  He committed his act for all to see.  There is video evidence of his transgression.  They need to nail down all evidence on the Rubal case.  Although, that should have honestly been done BEFORE they punish a player, not after.
---
Gigx didnt have articles written about his ban on large gaming media outlets. He's just a big baby with a big mouth
---
Not want to read too far into this, but are CCP admitting they fucked up?
---
So that's what the 1mil sp gift packages on hoboleaks were for..
---
When in doubt, I check the official [forum post](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/evemon-4-0-11-esi-edition/75953). Yep! Looks like you've got the right project.
---
&gt;and meanwhile meat new people.

I hadn't considered cannibalism....at least I'd assume you'd do something with the meat you turn new people into.

So what would happen to the existing PIBC on TQ?

Free piercing of the nipple of his choice

&gt;If you'd like to discuss this statement, please feel free to do so in this forum thread.

Ahh yes, if you have questions and concerns about what we do please post in this heavily modded forum.
---
Also, It looks like we found out what those large-volume SP rewards in that recent hoboleaks stuff is all about, CCP knew they were about to fuck up so they are getting SP rewards ready for the INIT. 3.
---
Shelby's a bot?
---
But wait, everyone in /r/eve told us bad bad INIT folks that CCP is never wrong and doesn't need to present evidence and blah blah blah :thinking:
---
&gt; We have also been conducting an internal review to substantiate the evidence available to us 
---
Why would they even take action in the first place before substantiating the evidence?
---
quick someone do my homework for me!

Thanks
---
Brisc Rubal's interest in your location intensifies
---
Not all heroes wear capes or are even human, some are dinosaurs in suits and we never knew we needed them until today
---
which is exactly why its fucking horseshit, and its a double standard.
---
Bewalk gets a "we don't discuss bans, make a new account if you want, piss off"
---
but because this douche can cause media attention, he gets a full review, blog post, discussions, whole teams working on this ban and if its legit or not.
---
Bewalk gets told to pound sand.
---
Easy to measure if this is true, just monitor the new player signup graph found here: [https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility](https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility)
---
Disastrous precedent. You don't give preferential treatment like this, after a decade and a half of rock hard principles of "no comment" in these situations, and you sure as fuck don't start talking about apologies or mistakes publicly unless you absolutely fucking have to. 
---
God damn it, CCP. Watrudoin. 
---
Can literally *never* ban anyone high-profile ever again, without them now being able to invoke the Brisc precedent, demanding public updates and investigations and so on. "Well he got it, why shouldn't we?" etc.
---
Awful precedent.

Copy/paste please? Doesn't seem to be loading on my phone. 😅

What's dead can not be killed again. Ccp has made it clear it doest care about bots, rorquals or isk sinks

Except there were. Gigx just didn't tie his irl identity to a game.
---
In every translation I’ve seen, the term is “Kostorg”, not “Kostorog”. It’s a difference of a single o, but I’m going to stand by it since I think the whole Caroline’s Star connection is far-fetched anyway. I’m not saying you can’t proceed with that assumption, just be aware of the oddities here.
---
https://www.eveonline.com/article/pq436e/interim-statement-on-brisc-rubal-follow-up-investigation
---
inb4 Brisc is reinstated and cleared on all wrongdoing and the rest of the GSM gets b&amp; for making false reports and/or falsifying evidence.
---
Personally I'm hoping we get at one more Naz post out of this before it wraps up... COMMON PLOT TWIST!
---
Aryth give me your isk quick!!! We know you are getting banned for feeding CCP lies!!! HURRYYYYYYYY
---
Big if true.
---
Totally could be, absolutely.
---
In either case, this just seems like damage control.  The community likes to speculate, and I'm not sure if this response helps calm the flames or fan them higher.
---
I don't have a dog in this race (I already won Eve), but if they did fuck up, it will be interesting to see how they rectify it.
---
If it turns out that CCP was wrong and Rubal did not break NDA, they have placed his livelihood at stake in their wrongdoings.  Such a statement is something Rubal could pass along to others, say the Bar for his state, to let them know that he is innocent of such claims.
---
    
---
Alternatively, they could be doing it just as a final f-you.  Make a statement announcing that they will apologize for any mistakes and make reparations before posting all the details showing that they didn't make any mistakes and he's full of it.
---
All you have to do is search back on CCP being retarded and it becomes a very very very long list of their incompetence.
---
Why? He's just the guy who published the banning devblog. It's like blaming aegis sov on CCP Fozzie...
---
One does not open the door if one has no intention of walking through it.
---
TQ is our server we play on. Chinese players play on Serenity. The PIBC have taken over the whole Chinese server and are now moving (allegedly) to ours, TQ. 
---
People are saying RIP PLEX because on Serenity, PLEX prices are astronomically high due to rampant botting and RMT. For whatever reason it is not as policed there as it is here (is it really?). So, the assumption is, with a huge influx of PIBC members, we will see a huge rise in botting which in turn raises PLEX prices.
---
Oh, quite possibly. google translate suggested the alternative form and from there there was suddenly a connection. Just wanted to bring it to your attention.
---
CCP can ban high profile people, they just need to do their research first and make sure that the ban is based on facts
---
less than 100mil? you mean when the russian guy dumped a few hundred thousand dollars of plex to buys?
---
Might it be the way they handled the ban. I'll believe in CCP's judgement unless they're proven wrong now in the coming week. Perhaps they have a proper reason for the bans, but they might not have thought about the consequences of mentioning Brisc Rubal in the original post?
---
But at the same time, they only mentioned the character name, not their fault that Brisc decided to tie his professional life to it as much has he has done.
---
What it says is somewhere they fucked up and one or more people will be exonerated and apologized to.
---
game time never cost less than 250M from what I remember of when PLEX released. However, now it's considerably higher.
---
What?
---
peak meta
---
Sounds like someone fucked up or CCP was threatened beyond defence.
---
I won't correct it.
---

---
thread devolving into derogetory remarks about China in 3, 2, 1..
---
Looking forward to winning Eve when I can't comfortably PLEX my accounts anymore due to Chinese botting.
---
I don’t know, perhaps it’s just as reasonable to say that this is a response to perceived community concerns or something along those lines.
---
CCP FEARS TEXAS LAW
---
He also threatened to cut off The Judge's hands.  Seems pretty open and shut to me.
---
So what. I get a daily overdose of people shitting on the U.S. It's time to spread that love around to all governments.
---
Main difference you are missing is that this is highly affecting Brisc RL as his photo and statement of being corrupted got into many news including not gaming ones. This is probably far from any other ban previously given to anyone.
---
&gt; start over with fresh clones
---
Start over.

Hello, sir. I understand English may not be your native language. Here I have translated the point of my post in various other languages for your use (as I do not know which language is your primary):
---
\&gt; Make cyno inhibitors turn off active cynos within range once it goes online.
---
\&gt; Haga que los inhibidores de la inactivación apague los cinos activos dentro del rango una vez que se conecte.
---
\&gt; 使cyno抑制剂一旦上线就关闭范围内的活跃cynos。
---
\&gt; Сделайте так, чтобы ингибиторы Cyno отключали активных Cyno в пределах диапазона, как только он выходит в сеть.
---
Hopefully this helps.
---
While I might be in one of the bigger nullsec blocks, if I take a quick glance over at null I basically see PanFam, so PL, NC. and PH on one side. Against mainly The Imperium, so goons, INIT., which are more or less blued to TEST when it comes to objectives. GOTG are pets to these guys at this point as well. Then again you have Fraternity which blues PanFam for bigger objectives afaik.
---
If you divide the map in two you'll see the two major entities that aren't allied. I wouldn't mind seeing Legacy + these new Chinese dudes form their own alliances and coalitions so that we have more than two major entities fighting.
---
The ship was mainly in response to the Ice Belts showing up in Shattered Wormholes and players asking "How are we supposed to mine the ice in a C13"? 
---
I think it was mainly an oversight by CCP when they decided to create the shattered systems. They all have the same properties, but the C13s  only have Frig wormhole statics. So they designed the Endurance and the Porpoise to mine in the C13s.  If you notice the mass, the Porpoise can traverse a frig hole.
---
On an unrelated note: any thoughts on the translation/analysis effort we’re working on further up the thread? The Kostorg/Kostorog dilemma, especially, is proving to be a bit of a hassle.
---
Happy Easter everyone
---
~~Logging in~~

~Learning CCP might not be 100% certain Brisc did anything wrong~
---
(Except using that boring ass Boosh meta to kill HKs Keepstar, was kinda boring ye know?)
---
if he's unbanned, i wonder how this will affect diplomacy with the other Goon CSM members
---
You should see Hek
---
Don't expect CCP to change. This was a one-of-a-kind situation for CCP, where there could be consequences for their actions. The next person who get's banned without solid evidence isn't going to get the same treatment.
---
i would like to speculate wildly about whom did or didnt have sex with he/her/xim/xur
---
For reference 500 plex on Serenity is around 20B. Things may be bad here, but not apocalyptic
---
Yeah, I know. But already region locked. Eve TQ, Reddit, discord, YouTube and so on all are locked by the great fire wall and Chinese game policy. That's why there is Chinese sever, Chinese BBS, Chinese chatting software and so on. We were in the same internet about 10y ago until the wall was built.
---
We, Chinese TQ players, in some sense, are the breakers of the iron curtain. It's really good for cross-cultural communication and cultural diversity of the new Eden.
---
And, about the bot and rmt. I think it's CCP's duty and job. Believe in CCP and give him a hand if we could.
---
Doxing is something completely different.
---
Welcome to the real world
---
&gt; after a decade and a half of rock hard principles of "no comment" in these situations
---
That's kinda part of the problem -- they broke precedent in their initial announcement by saying he breached the NDA, something that has RL impact.   In the past, they just did a "you're out" with some vague context.
---
thats his fault, not ccps.
---
or they did the whole Et Tu Brute.  and forgot he's not mortal. he's a capsuleer.   so his new clone is coming back.
---
Just because they were a part of the offer didnt mean you had to marry the sheep effendi
---
time to learn Russian and help them fight the Chinese overlords
---
Shut up, you Pedo
---
Of course it's a double-standard. There could have, conceivably, been real consequences to CCP for this if they handled it wrong, so they are treating it differently than banning a 30 year old IT guy who plays a lot and has 300 friends on facebook.
---
Your friend isn't special, and that's the reason he doesn't get preferential treatment. He can't hurt CCP.
---
As a newer player that still doesn’t understand a 100th of the abbreviations and corp drama that happens on this forum, would anyone mind giving me a basic rundown of who this (these) is and what they did? 
---
Thanks in advance and your time.
---
Or it could be meant to forestall objections from Brisc. If they end up confirming the ban, they can point to this statement and say "we did a thorough investigation, and we *said* we would apologize if we fucked up, but we didn't fuck up, so we're not apologizing."
---
It could be paving the way for a later apology, but it could also be an attempt to portray CCP as a neutral party committed to finding the truth, which would strengthen their next statement if they confirm the previous decision. I think both are valid interpretations, which is why I still think the statement essentially says nothing.
---
if you get wiplash in a bomber.....what does that do to the bombs in the bomb bay o.o
---
NO COLLUSION

It's more likely they will try to saddle up with goons. PIBC  are affiliated with PLA.

---
some warping around grid happens while Snuff gets their dreads in, and fighting starts next to the Astrahus.   
---

---
Has any prominent banned player claimed innocence as hard as Brisc has? This could be in response to his posts on the issue.
---
Oh... I'm winning EVE atm so the flair is irrelevant, but I always loved EVE politics.
---
I don't disagree with Goons'political stance, they do what they think is the best for their members, not necessarily for the health of the game. I don't like that pretty much everyone (apart from PH, FRT, NC. and some irrelevant pandemic alliances) now cooperates with Goons, but again, they do what they think is the best for their members. Can't blame them, but can't be happy with it.
---
This is going to be really, really fun for awhile, then possible quite bad for the game. The Chinese majority are not great at EVE, if my time playing on serenity was any indication.
---
Maybe things have changed over the years though, who knows.
---
OUR AUTISM WILL BLOT OUT THE SUN
---
10x approximate current cost seems pretty close to apocalyptic.
---
Imagine giving Brisc credit for the HK eviction
---
Are they just expanding into TQ or giving up on Serenity and totally moving in?
---
U n b l u n t
---
&gt;hey have placed his livelihood at stake in their wrongdoings
---
Nobody forced him to tie his IRL career to a video game. Unless they did something actively malicious (rather than simply negligent) that shits on him.
---
Also, that’s not the same kind of Triggerfish. It’s got a different Latin desig., which makes it an even bigger reach to make the Caroline’s Star connection.
---
The awful precedent was started when they did the original blog post, none of this would have happened of they just said "Brisc Rubal has been removed from the CSM." and then separately banned his account.  The perp walk they did to Brisc Rubal was completely unnecessary.
---
sounds like a new take on "LOCAL IS PRIMARY"
---
What if it’s hot inside and you have no windows?
---
You don't typically post something like that publicly unless you think maybe you did screw up and will have to take restorative action.
---
Depending on what part of space you fly in, the biggest change will either be: Alphas can no longer do lvl4 missions (highsec), Fighters got a significant application nerf (low/null?), or everybody's flying Triglavian now (w-space). I'm not really qualified to comment on Nullsec politics or metas at the moment.
---
Skimmed through the comments and something I haven't seen anyone mention yet is that before citadels, all trading was done in NPC stations and NPC stations have a brokers fee based on your faction standing with that faction.  So a prerequisite of being a serious traders/merchants used to involve having high Caldari standings, so you Jita margins would be higher.  Having high Caldari standing means having low Gallente standings, meaning that at the very least broker's fees for Jita traders would be much higher in Dodixie, assuming they could even get goods over there without the NPC police shooting at them.  Sure, some people are going to only be trading in Gallente space and some Jita traders will have Dodixie alts, but the standing thing is still going to decrease trading activity in Gallente/Minmatar space as opposed to Caldari/Amarr sapce.

You could buy game time with is long before plex. You bought game time codes on the eve forums. They had a whole system for it to verify the code and everything.

---
 This predates plex. There was a forum on the eve website and a system for trading game time codes
---
Mistakes were made?
---
On the one hand, it's really good that CCP is willing to publicly correct mistakes, but on the other hand this seems like something that is so serious that you'd want to take some extra time to be 100% certain of before pulling the trigger on in the first place.

They're niche ships. That doesn't make them worthless. Not all mining ships are optimized for yield--these are two that aren't. Specifically, the Prospect and the Endurance are the only mining ships in the game that can slip through a basic gate camp. Most folks (understandably) try to set things up so that's not a concern, but if it is... these are your ships.
---
Set up a brawl with 5-10 ships all the same, provide ships , record it . Last man standing gets shiny ship. Learn what strengths and weaknesses are of your team , see who works together well and who needs individual attention.  If you want to be extra sneaky next time giver the better pilots worse ships and see how they adapt.

90% of the fight is showing up. Make it fun and people will come .  Set up a yolo roam and go lose ships .  Most  people who have not pvp have only done it non consensualy . It is hard to get over the hurdle of losing your ship . 
---
If you have a pve centric corp set up a mining op or something to do together to get a community spirit going, after a few weeks spring the death match on them and hand out the ships.
---
nobody expects the ~~spani..~~ icelandic inquisition!
---
Make em activate instantly too, really force the fights without cap interference.
---
"As should be expected, we will issue a full and frank apology for any mistakes for which we are responsible, as well as provide appropriate reparations to those affected by any erroneous actions we’ve taken."
---
Interesting.  This is the pre apology before the actual apology.  You all get to blow off steam about it.
---
The most interesting question to is will all those people who said "get fucked Brisc, haha, lol, wrecked, corrupt politician" apologise on Reddit, or will you, like me, recycle your account and create a new one.
---
Grownups admit when they make big mistakes and apologize and try to make amends. Naughty children hide from the truth under cover of precedents.
---
Unfortunately, too many people never grow up.
---
*Andrew Groen - Empires of EVE* . Very interesting book, gives you an insight into early EVE culture.
---
There used to be a site called eveinfo.net or something like that, which was a copy of Goonswarm internal wiki and included a lot of references to Great Wars, obviously from goons' point of view.
---
Kugutsumen, another fascinating site, sadly lost in time.
---
And obviously reddit, at least recently. And obviously biased, but after some time one learns to filter out bias and read the actual message...
---
Have fun and fly safe!

Mittens has.
---
I want to see the Rubal Report!
---
I like this idea, additionally, for new bros who are afraid to lose a ship, it might be best if we provide them ships and fits for the exercise that they have to return to us (if they don't die). I can see these ships as being inexpensive so this shouldn't be an issue. :)
---
Because someone who is running a fleet of bots couldn't possibly come up with putting a bot on the gate to their ratting pocket.
---
And I've caught people autopiloting orcas and freighters through low and null. People do dumb shit. I was talking about most players. It's hard to catch a non AFK venture, but it's also a newbie ship.
---
Not only that, but anyone inventing the t2 bpcs using the current, much cheaper data cores.
---
&gt;Not want to read too far into this, but are CCP admitting they fucked up?
---
I think it's almost certain. They wouldn't be preparing us like this if they hadn't realized they made a mistake.
---
Next cheater will reveal his face too, so he cant get banned?
---
Time for free Gigx too?
---
I've got to be honest, I think his ban was kind-of harsh.  Someone just telling him not to be such a knob would have been perfectly adequate, or even 3 or 6 months. 
---
I just think this permanent ban malarky, giving people no second, third or forth chance, is kind-of punitive.
---
Yeh, start it off with T1 Rifters or Kestrels or whatever.
---
Wont cost more than 1 mill a ship.
---
Goons set him up!  😂
---
You do realize that Plex is bought with real money and placed on market and sold for isk right?
---
Thanks so much, I’ll have a look at the empires of Eve book, hopefully I can find it online somewhere
---
One of the big elements behind this is what the culture considers a 'win'. 
---
Did you win the 'ISK War', did you win the objective, did you get a bunch of kills?  Some cultures operate in a highly strategic mode, i.e. in the last week, did we earn more ISK than we lost. Other groups focus on fun-per-hour angles.   
---
Some sub-cultures within groups feel that strat-ops are the worst thing ever, because it takes away from krabbing-time.
---
I guess this is what Brisc is banned for. All the Veles items jumped in price on the 5th or 6th.
---
My endurance and prospect love shattered WHs
---
Can confirm :)
---
Woosh
---
Should we focus on teaching about angular distances and such? Ammo falloff, module scripts, and whatnot? Or is that considered more advanced training?
---
It's in my religion, tho
---
I call it now, Brisc will stay banned, the INIT fc’s will be given a shorter ban.
---
!Remindme 1 week
---
o/ i'll let you in on a secret. 
---
as a corp ages and changes with the game membership, changes along with it. 
---
if you aren't enjoying the game, or even logging in i think the best bet would be to rip the bandaid off nice and quick, speak to your corp and tell them, i had more fun back when i was in Test and i would like to move myself back. They can only handle it a handful of ways.
---
if they react in any way other than wishing you well then they aren't good friends and that is what a corp should be. No decent eve player would hold it against you for moving corp, its not like you wouldn't still chat and roam with them if you wanted to. 
---
At the end of the day Eve is a game, and if you aren't enjoying yourself then you should change something so you are. 
---
[Dreddit](Https://dredditisrecruiting.com) will be here with open arms and autistic screeching if you want to get back to flyting with the good guys!
---
Prospects are worth the price (which isn't exactly all that much) for the larger cargo hold alone. In addition you can speed tank instrumentals in them which is handy sometimes.
---
You seem like a very reasonable person. However CCP currently already are outmanned and outgunned when it comes to botting and RMT. If now the winners of the chinese server come over enmass. That means ccp will be even further outmanned and outgunned. Especially if said players consider it normal to bot and RMT.

Gaming company that gutted it's community team and is worked to the bone fucks up a ban but they banned the wrong man!
---
nope, cause im not chinese, dont live in china, and dont pay for stuff in china with a chinese paypal.
---
The best weapon? Type “Taiwan #1” into chat.
---
\#FREEBRISC
---
Okay, that's some quality snark
---
What a dumb take.
---
CCP doesn't give a shit about justice or ethics. They are by default always right, well until, until there is a media backslash. Then it's suddenly damage-control mode.
---
Remember the bonus room scandal? CCP knew what was going on there for a long time and did nothing. They were approached internally by CSM members and again, did nothing. Only after it was given media attention it was suddenly all "oh, now THAT is totally wrong. If only we had known ... blabla"
---
Same with game breaking bugs and exploits. If you want to get anything fixed, make them public and start the reddit hate train. Otherwise nothing is going to happen.
---
Fucking hypocrites ...
---
omg
---
“We do not believe the summary accurately represented the investigation’s findings so here is a redacted version.”
---
he's one of the leadership in the Imperium group Init.
---
he's also part of the player elected council of stellar management, but recently got banned after other members of the CSM(council of stellar management) provided evidence of wrongdoing on his part (leaking something?).
---
in real life, he's a politician,  so being banned for leaking in a video game kinda hurts his real life job. and he refused the claim.  
---
we dont know what he was charged with doing, nor apparently(allegedly) does he. CCP apparently has not told him.   
---
and after some media attention, its kinda escalated a little. and now CCP is saying they'll give some info to explain whats going on.
---
extra drama: most of the CSM is Imperium.  Et Tu, Brute.  type scenario here.  and if he's unbanned. oh i would love to see the reaction of the members who tried to get him banned.
---
&gt;Thinking about it relative to people's incomes and to the amount of isk destroyed is the key. The problem now is that 10x as much stuff does not die compared to 2006
---
Destruction of ships and structures isn't an ISK sink.  Ship insurance is an ISK faucet.  The rest is just moving ISK between players.
---
CCP also set a precedence with their initial devblog about the ban in regards to detail.
---
It does make sense to also be more public with their follow up investigation.
---
In Iceland?
---
You fly legion so cool, some of our folks name you "legion brother".
---
Not to mention the covops cloak is almost a prerequisite for an exploration Astero.
---
considering he is a politician this could actually be the second case, im not saying it is, im saying just you could be very on point
---
l got roasted on here just for saying that there mite be more to this and that we should just let init and ccp sort it out lol guess l was kinda right
---
&gt;The only real way is to redesign everything from ground up to the point that makes it difficult to bot. 
---
It should be noted that this isn't actually possible.
---
Pick a game, there's a bot for it.
---
Just imagine the camping everywhere due to alphas with cloaks

---
I can see this coming to Eve...
---
FYI, a sniper tengu will alpha them before they align and warp.
---
Also, it’s “whether” not “weather”
---
could be volcano season
---
I assume to prevent alleged manipulation from getting uncontrollable.
---
it seemed to be common knowledge that chinese players on tranquility could only pay for game time via plex, if thats incorrect then fair enough. id happily put my hands up and admit im wrong. but thats at least a very prevalent and popular myth.
---
Or, you know, this might've had something to do with that:
---
https://twitter.com/CCP_Rise/status/1113835830617894913
---
Ohhhh completely slipped my mind. So I would change my previous comment to like 65% since I am cloaked almost always.
---
Just the joy of killing one another to start off, you will get over achieving people but they can learn themselves, your job is to get the ball rolling
---
They said that they'd provide reparations...  I was injured by this... somehow...  I think I need 1000 large skill injectors to make things right.
---
&gt;I completely agree with your final line. Botting is an issue that CCP need to deal with. Its rampant throughout Eve.
---
Could not agree more - and the state of Serenity is a testament to the fact that the Chinese player-culture spreads botting and RMT like a weed.
---
EC-300 have low jam chances on anything better than a T1 frig. They're worth having a set if you have spare room to jam out a tackler.
---
En masse, EC drones will get enough jams on logis to be useful but you need like 25+ per T2 logis to get any decent jam probability.
---
People saw what they wanted of course, turning a blind eye to history.
---
Sad!! it is all sad no matter which way it turns out.   
---
So if CCP messed up then what is payback to the people and to their corps and alliances?
---
I heard they have volcanoes in their homes there, so yeah
---
Imagine giving him credit for anything
---
They need that plus some capability to not die (HP readjustment so you can logi them) or be much smaller (so you can carry lots and keep anchoring new ones).
---
Personally, i'd start with the very basics and have a brawl. Press F1, orbit target and scram him etc etc. 
---
Then work into module scripts and falloff and more advanced topics.
---
 A good practice thing i still do with some of my corp mates on Sisi is take 2-3 people with fast ships and put them vs someone whos slightly slower and start teaching slingshotting and how to deal with that kinda thing. 
---
But to start, just set up a fleet fight, have 2 FCs and have them go nuts and whelp the fleet a few times.
---
Publicly accusing someone of breaking a legal document without fully evaluating the evidence likely falls well into the gross negligence category.
---
Nolak did.
---
Oh CCP you master baiters. I bet 359 ISK that last paragraph is a bait to r/eve and next week they will just re-confirm the bans.
---
NC deployment over next week when Shines and Pando back?
---
Yea that does not nearly have the same impact as the weapons dropping as an item and now through blueprints.
---
It's clearly the combination of both.
---
It doesn't actually say that, but it is definitely setting the stage for that, and why would they be doing that if they didn't know that mistakes were made?
---
Eve Online: 90% Drama, 10% Game Mechanics. Still kickin' since 2003!

Why give him all the credit when it was a team effort by Goons, not just Brisc alone

ITT: westerners who know nothing about China, Serenity or PIBC
---
They banned me and I still have no response to the ticket I made 7 years ago
---
show me on the doll where the dino touched you.
---
You’re reading way too much into this. It’s possible they didn’t fuck up at all and are just backpedaling because the community is so hostile currently.
---
as soon as judge regrows hands?
---
WTF??
---
Can somebody translate this to English?
---
Gotcha, I did some googling and my mind is blown by the similarities
---
I can't speak for plex prices but you can check ship/module prices yourself on the serenity KB:

English isn't my first language but shouldn't they have written
---
&gt;As should be expected, we *would* issue a full and frank apology for any mistakes for which we *would* be responsible, as well as provide appropriate reparations to those affected by any erroneous actions we *might*'ve taken.
---
Or something like that. 
---
Unless…
---
Understandable, but it still seems like some sort of pro vs con analysis was skipped over in this case. It's just kind of hard for me to imagine that one or two people possibly making some isk on market transactions really sets the need for such absolute, heavy-handed response like that, especially if it came hasty and on evidence that was anything other than absolutely concrete.
---
This is more intriguing than RL politics.
---
INIT is a major nullsec alliance (~7,000 pilots). Brisc Rubal is an INIT member who is also on the CSM (Council of Stellar Management, a group of elected players who talk to CCP directly about in-game issues). Pando and Shines are INIT's two most active FCs and responsible for 90% of their content. 
---
In order to do their jobs, CSM members are privy to lots of sensitive information not (yet) available to the public, especially regarding upcoming changes. Because of this, they all have to sign an NDA (non-disclosure agreement), forbidding them legally from sharing said information. 
---
9 days ago, CCP accused Brisc of violating the NDA, removed him from the CSM, and permanently banned all his accounts from the game. They also banned Pando and Shines for one year, which is a disaster for INIT ([source](https://www.eveonline.com/article/ppne2z/brisc-rubal-removed-from-the-csm-13)). CCP have still not disclosed the exact allegations leveraged against the three - the assumption here being that Brisc leaked some intel about an upcoming change to Pando and Shines, who then supposedly used it to their own benefit. 
---
Ever since, the accused parties together with INIT leadership have been trying to communicate to CCP and appeal the decision, and this post makes it look like they've had some success. To be continued.
---
Sorry for being late! Last week on the EVE patch day I was about to make an update, but as CCP fucked up HAW, I decided to wait for a day until they fix it (so that the fix would be included as well).
---
Then something I cannot explain happened. I decided to fix few bugs with undo/redo, and after like 80+ hours of coding ended up rewriting significant part of the application. Hopefully it's better now, but changes I've implemented are relatively risky - so performance might degrade, some crashes might appear. If you find anything wrong with the new release - post your issues to [https://github.com/pyfa-org/Pyfa/issues](https://github.com/pyfa-org/Pyfa/issues).
---
In other news: Icelandic Cod now accepted in shipping ports along North East United States.
---
&gt; But because this fuck gets a bunch of angry reddit nerds he gets a fucking DEVBLOG about HIS BAN?
---
It's because he is the csm. We shouldn't have first class players and then the rest. Whatever the reuslt of ccp's investigation is we can tell for sure some players are more equal than others.
---
Sounds to me CCP fucked up with that last statement...
---
"Whhhhyyyyyy" 
---
&lt;3 squishy
---
Sure
---
It's stuff like this that makes me wish I didn't drink so much and had never taken up playing the banjo.
---
Capitalism and (pretending to be)communist dictatorship are not a contradiction anymore. You are the experiment of Capitalism if democracy is still needed for a "free" economy or if it is rather business spoiling. The experiment is going well and the rest of the world will follow (sadly). So you can have a bank account and consume, but shut the fuck up about the topics a few lines below or you get a nice "Vacation" in a camp ...
---
but who would believe mittens was innocent of anything
---
How so? Can I tie my RL reputation to my account to get preferential treatment in ban appeals?

---
Hello again!
---
In late May we will have several changes and additions surrounding the Triglavians and their technology. There will be new ships, new module variations, and changes to faction weapon variations that allow the use of tech II ammo to name a few.
---
We are going to use this release as an opportunity to adjust some aspects of Triglavian ship and module production. Below we will share details for those changes with the aim of giving you ample time to adjust your production strategies and give us feedback on the changes.
---
**Tech II Ships**
---
Several changes are being made to tech II Triglavian ship production to add more precursor flavor and establish consistency.
---
**New Skills** – We will be Introducing two new skills: Triglavian Encryption Methods and Triglavian Quantum Engineering which will be required for invention and manufacturing of Tech II Triglavian Ships.
---
**New Datacores** – A new Datacore will be added: Triglavian Quantum Engineering which will be used for Invention of tech II Triglavian ships and Entropic Disintegrators.
---
**New Components** – We will be adding 5 new tech II component types for use in Tech II Triglavian ship production.
---
* Radiation Absorption Thruster
---
* Singularity Radiation Converter
---
* Zero-Point Field Manipulator
---
* Trinary State Processor
---
* Lattice Locked Dekaisogen
---
**The Zarmazd** – All of the above changes will retroactively be applied to the Zarmazd to make Tech II ship production consistent for the whole line.
---
Note: In all cases where a new material is added to requirements for production or invention it will ***replace*** an existing one, not be added on top.
---
**Faction ‘Veles’ Entropic Disintegrators**
---
Veles Disintegrators have been cheaper than tech II since the release of the Abyss due mostly to dropping fully built. This was not ideal but at least there was a meaningful tradeoff vs tech II as Veles variations did not have access to tech II ammo. With that changing in May, we also need to address the cost issue.
---
* Faction Disintegrator variations will now drop as blueprints
---
* Producing Faction Disintegrators will now require a Tech II Disintegrator of the appropriate size as a build material.
---
* Producing Faction Disintegrators will now require the skill Triglavian Quantum Engineering
---
**Exotic Plasma Charges**
---
We are not happy with the relative price of Tech I and Tech II Exotic Plasma Charges. Tech I prices have been much higher than Tech II for a variety of reasons and Disintegrator ammo in general is quite expensive relative to other ammo types.
---
* All Tech I Exotic Plasma Charge Blueprints will now produce 5000 units (was 1000 units)
---
This should leave tech II prices in a similar place but drive tech I prices down substantially.
---
None of these changes should be considered final but we hope this announcement allows some time for you to adjust your production plans and give us feedback.
---
Thanks, and fly safe!
---
This is a rabbit hole that goes very *very* deep.
---
You have been warned.
---
Having said that, theres a lot of very intereting stories.  Even people who dont play the game follow this sub to read them.
---
There's a big difference though between you figuring it and them saying it
---
imagine a single one of u weedbrained retard monkies thinking ccp banned somebody for a legitimate reason
---
its more likely to be a false ban than a real one
---
Wrong. That clown made his own bed.
---
I see you enjoy alarm-clocking then.
---
I'd sooner say make them unrepairable. Kill the target before the inhib gets killed or fight targets that you can kill.
---
As it stands every type of ship can carry one in their cargo so no need to make them smaller. Just have more people bring them.
---
O\_o WTF
---
$$$$$$ Brisc about to get paid $$$$$$$$
---
The issue has nothing to do with bans.  They accused him of breaking NDA, something with legal and professional impact.  If they just removed + banned him, there's no issue re: his IRL being attached to his in-game characters.
---
Would be nice to program a bot to go to work for me :V
---
&gt; screams that they fucked up.
---
no, it screams that reddit are having a tantrum over it so they have to do something before people go crying to the gaming media over it.
---
Imagine I didn't need to put a /s on the original comment...
---
https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/chineses-tycoon-son-buys-car-complains-about-taxes
---
Awesome, thank you very much.
---
No, if anything the anchor time could be increased. Get your response fleet in fast (before it anchors) or don't get them in via cyno at all. Pays to be prepared and on alert.
---
Oooohhhhh!
---
Sorry, my fault. The purpose of Serenity is to be inside the firewall, thus allowing Chinese ~~plaguers~~ players easily access it. 
---
I tend to suspect the worse though, so it might well be true...
---
Cheers
---
you: Oops, I accidentally let something identifying me on stream, guess it's my fault if I get swatted
---
About the botting, I think it's too easy to design and update an Eve bot. Though WOW has some farmers(I don't know the exact in eng) to farm a dungeon for real money, you never find a bot army could knock down sargeras. It's the thing that CCP could do to make ratting and mining harder for bots.
---
And about rmt, someone has told me an idea before. Why not build an official rmt market and tax on it, if it needs too many gm to find and kill rmt?
---
&gt;The real question is: Why would they even post this?
---
Because lawyers are now involved i bet.
---
You mean stagger jump? Like they click jump and go in a queue where one ship jumps in per x seconds?
---
Tbf they are able to be logi'd atm. Possibly not in the way you would think optimal. As in not very feasible for small gangs. But a couple of fax with one shield, one armour and one hull repper each can keep a titan from killing it.
---
Either they are credit-card warriors or they are RMT'ers. They cannot be both at once.
---
Is there archive with all these mails "decrypted" into latin form?
---
This is a string bet tractic.
---
Not gonna apologize for something that is true. :)
---
I read above that they're already blue to GOONs
---
Every single one.
---
Thank you for all your hard work.
---
Yeah, tying his IRL ID to his csm character was dumb.  But CCP's blog was dumber.  Just say he is banned for internal reasons and this wouldn't have happened.
---
Nothing. You can literally beat on bombs with a sledgehammer and they won't go off if they haven't been primed/activated first. This, by the way, is a fantastic way to scare the shit out of young officers in the military.
---
You just wouldn't include the sentence at all if you weren't having doubts.
---
Just a small correction,  Brisc isn't in the leadership of Init. (or even our corp STK-S for that matter, he's just a line member)  Everything else is spot on though.
---
I dont think they NPCs react on the test server. Ive tried a few times to test haw dread builds and never got the response fleet
---
Just too bad a "this is how this happened and this is how we are going to prevent it in the future" won't happen.
---
Yeah, it seems pretty clear that the attorney wrote this too
---
Some PIBC are already in goons...suggest you do your research.  Also the refugees of PIBC are already on the server with us!
---
I didnt read it as such. Sounds more like, we will be putting the case together thoroughly and if we find any mistakes we will correct them.
---
EVE = work, "real jobs" are just hobbies that pay for you to go to work
---
New officer mod: Brisc Rubal's Modified Damage Control
---
Cracks Forming
---
At least it isn't olmeca. I'm sure we'll have that novella posted later in the week
---
So, yes tie your RL reputation to your EVE account to get preferential treatment in ban appeals.
---
but they minmatar bombs.....we lost 32 of them when private jenkins took a strip of duct tape off one of them.
---
ah, thanks for the correction o7
---
&gt; strat-ops are the worst thing ever, because it takes away from krabbing-time.
---
Or because anchor f1 tidi blobs aren't fun and engaging
---
For those paying attention to other things over the past 4 months, Snuff (and all the imperium batphones they can get their hands on) have been consistently attacking TRI and other entities involved in a conflict against the now \*mostly dead\* "Pure Blind Madness" coalition. This has included [aborting](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76249891/) [our](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76030537/) [anchoring](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75242078/) [forts](https://zkillboard.com/kill/75405360/), [attacking](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76268633/) [our](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76245409/) [stagings](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74744394/) and [indy](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76261906/), reffing our staging ihubs, showing up to defend PB Madness timers many many many time, and just generally acting on behalf of PB Madness, though only one alliance of that group remains after months of conflict, Banderlogs Alliance. Snuff and INIT presumably doing all this for good fites, I am sure.  
---
AAR:  
---
TRI had a fleet up this morning anyways(because PB madness have all their defensive timers set to AUTZ, even though they are a russian group, all in the name of good fites, of course). We had just wrapped it up when we noticed snuff alts coming into local, with a hauler and a ceptor apparently burning a ping behind our fort. We chase the ceptor off and get a few small things undocked. Hauler decloaked and starts anchoring the astra.  
---
We rageping, online our system wide cyno jammer, and reform machs with a few fax and warp it over right as we see snuff showing up with a legion gang. 11-12 legion, several lokis, 6 guardian, hic or 2, etc. We also have some carriers yolo fighters over from our fort to help with dps against the astra if we fight the legions. Snuff cyno in a significant number of dreads and a apostle in the next door system, right on the gate and jump them in. We bubble fuck the gate to slow them down while applying dps to the astra, while forming our own dreads.  
---
Eventually, the bubbles die down and the enemy caps break free and start warping over, with their subs. They for some reason, do some bouncing around on grid with their dreads and subs, and feed a couple to us while the rest sit on a ping. Eventually they warp everything in, with sniper dreads at range, and others at close range. We attempt to get some kills, but lacking appropriate webs/tps until much much later into the fight, we were not able to break their reps against the 6 guardians, and once their apostle landed, it was the same. We then warped our dreads in to apply dps to their fax and dreads. We sat there brawling and not breaking much, until their landed all their dreads and decided to headshot our fc. This causes some issues with anchoring our subs and in the process, we lose a number of machs who were not moving and get insta'd by the dreads. rip 3x multiboxing during AUTZ cancer fights. During this time, our carrier fighters manage to kill the astra.  
---
As we lose ships, folks reship and warp in another. Eventually, we get the upper hand on the dreads and kill their apostle to boot, who ran outa cap charges. During the fight, more and more EUTZ are logging in and fleshing out the fleet roles like webs and tps that we are missing, though a bit uncoordinated, so not as good as it could have been. With all their caps dead or dying, snuff pull range while we are anchored to our fax, who is our only reps, who has hero tanked the entire fight against the enemy dreads. Snuff pull range range, ninja a random dread of ours that yolo warped way off the fleet, shoot all the wrecks they can, and begin to evac their subcaps. As they were beginning to jump out, Tau had some [parting words](https://imgflip.com/i/2ytib6) for us, which were humorous, considering the fleet + batphones they brought to [kill our azbel](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76261906/) not 24 hours before.   
---
We clean the field of Banderlog bombers and random scrub ships, safe our caps, and dock up. It was a good fight, without a doubt, but considering the ninja anchor during AUTZ on a wednesday, I doubt it was intended to be one. All the same, GOOD FIGHT!
---
I'm just hoping no one tried to railroad the guy with fake evidence of wrong doing, which if CCP acted on, would result meet the "you made our job more difficult because of what you did" ban standard they implemented after all the T20/K stuff.

Hey everybody! Finally got around to releasing my first single, a cover of Below The Asteroids! Hope y'all enjoy! Took on a slightly more classical approach. This song is seriously one of the best out of the EVE soundtrack, and was one of the first I listened to when I first started playing.
---
School project? Take donations?
---
As far as I can tell though brisc is not in any leadership position as far as init goes, maybe he is within the corp he is in?
---
I'm not sure that holds up given how obvious it would be what happened.  You could make the case that dumping him from the CSM and banning him amounts to an implicit accusation.
---
Just like socialism, its really easy to say that when it doesn't effect you.
---
Only if they had the evidence at the time.  It's possible Brisc or someone else produced additional evidence, not that CCP evaluated what they had wrong.
---
lol snuff
---
If it's provable that he did wrong, then challenging it publicly would make his situation worse. CCP implied heavily that the offense was provable with their original statement. If that's not the case, his being in politics doesn't really change much. If anything, it just means he has more experience and resources to force a reply or response. Anyone going through legal channels would technically obligate some kind of response from CCP, at least in private.
---
Banned for operating a casino.
---
Oh God, 
---
This is actually my ping....
---
Yeah he was kinda caught red handed...
---
I thought CSM originally turned him in to CCP?
---
I guess all those gamer magazine, Variety and news outlets are going to have to do a redaction?
---
Never sell when supply far outreaches demand. Save it and hope the demand rises later.

Right? Wouldn't they need to make new chars on TQ since they cant move accounts over from serenity?
---
It really isn't, but okay. I'll bow down to your expertise, you obviously know a lot more than everyone else. /s
---
You asked a question in your original post, multiple people have told you the answer too. Yet all you're doing is giving back snide remarks like you know better.

They are used a lot in wormhole space: fact.

I tend not to argue with stupid, so I'm just going to drop out of this conversation which you clearly know more about. Have a nice day.

There is only group garantied against PIBC and that is frat.

They hate each others guts from back when both played on Serenety.

That'll be a mercy ban at this point

Because its ccp... were it anyone else getting banned they wouldnt get an 'investigation' like this. 
---
I know a guy who is still permabanned after years for being in the wrong chat channel.

We all figured that's the case, but I have never seen a company say that in advance.

How fucking tasteless are you manchildren where you post shit about a massacre as youre le epic spaceship meme to "do your part against the Chinese menace"? How old are you? If its anything over the age of 16 you need to do some serious contemplation about what kind of person you come across as.

Nah, there's plenty of room for cover.  Look, for example, at how dramatically differently they handled Manny's removal:

That's a hands-off topic around here.

I suppose if you want to sign an NDA as well, sure.
---
I believe he said "fite me irl"
---
Hope this sticks as the name
---
Could just disband the CSM altogether and save us all the constant, CONSTANT drama that surrounds it every year.
---
As someone clueless to what this post is referring to , can I get a TLDR?
---
Wow, so racism is okay in EVE now
---
The way I see it, I imagine that CCP is less concerned about two people making ISK off of it and more concerned about the playerbase *finding out* that people made ISK off of it and having that damage the "sanctity of the CSM". I'm not very involved in the EVE community, but I've definitely heard griping about CSM positions allegedly being abused in the past. If I were CCP and I caught someone trying to do this, I would want to shine a light on it to build trust in my ability to keep the CSM from being abused. This is a good thought in theory, for CCP's sake I hope they can back up their claim now that they have made it
---
It was linked and CCP knew it. If it turns out he didn't do it that just sucks.
---
That's why you shouldn't make proclamations without even a whiff of subject matter knowledge
---
join karmafleet instead
---
&gt; Or it could be meant to forestall objections from Brisc.
---
The objection they have to worry about from Brisc is proving that he broke a NDA in a court of law, not public opinion.
---
Transactions are a lot easier to reverse right as it happens and get exponentially more difficult to fix as money changes hands. I know absolutely nothing of what actually happened but given it’s almost certainly market related it’s important to keep that idea in mind
---
No. CCP did not screw up on this one. Brisk found an Iceland attorney. This is normal process for high profile people like this. Brisk let slip some clue about the carrier NSA preventing warp and his guys acted on it. Now he has enough resources and legal contacts to put so much pressure on CCP that they are finding it easier to just gave in than pursue the right course of action.
---
Well, it seems more likely now than before the update i'd say.

Last week, on April 8 2019, we announced the permanent banning of Brisc Rubal and their ejection from the Council of Stellar Management. We also issued one-year bans to two other players involved in this incident and confiscated their associated in-game assets and ISK.
---
Following this statement, we have held further discussions with the affected parties. We have also been conducting an internal review to substantiate the evidence available to us and evaluate our handling of the situation. We intend to share a full follow-up statement next week.
---
Transparency, fairness and trust is of utmost importance to us, which is why we’re issuing this brief update while also taking the time to ensure that we conduct a thorough investigation. We understand that there are many questions lingering over the incident, and we want to assure you that we take this matter very seriously. Both the sanctity of the CSM and the relationship we have with our players is of paramount importance to CCP.
---
As should be expected, we will issue a full and frank apology for any mistakes for which we are responsible, as well as provide appropriate reparations to those affected by any erroneous actions we’ve taken.
---
If you'd like to discuss this statement, please feel free to do so in this forum thread.
---
A natural ally for Imperium Legacy. They've already got like 65-70% of null blued.
---
yeah is sounds like a lead up to an OPPS. Or Brisc has threatened legal action for smearing his name on flimsy evidence. I'm sure super shady market activities were tracked. Do they have the needed evidence to prove beyond a doubt it was Brisc who give his alliance mates the info? maybe not. And since Brisc likes to bring his real life into the game he would be a fool to just take a ban.
---
We have some Chinese-speaking corps but I have no idea what their relationship is to PIBC. I read a bunch of speculation above and wouldn't think too much of it until we see how this all shakes out.
---
It's a meme that is related to the chinese president.. and as he seems to be a special snowflake.... the meme is banned in China
---
Crap if CCP really screwed. They can bet that Brisc will do it yankee bastards way and sue them for harm to his name, family, reputation, karma, whatever else... It is yamkees way to sue for such things...
---
I thonk all the money they got from selling to that china company now belongs to Brisc... Or they will be after he sue them...
---
So let me understand this.. he leaked something about the NSA used on carriers.. and someone else sold a faction titan.. and that's somehow linked?
---
The ride never ends
---
Please stay focused brother. Don't permit yourself into conversations that will lead you in diverse paths. Remember hold to the iron rod brother.
---
Is that a new tinfoil hat?
---
That's what's bothered me the most, really. I've never been the sort to blindly believe statements from people, or even authority figures, without some kind of corroboration behind it. Call me skeptical, distrusting even, but I've always preferred that people *convince* me of something rather than just tell me what to believe. 
---
A lot of people here and the forums have been so quick to ride the hatetrain because of whatever predisposed animosity they hold about him, most of them related to politics. These "trials by social media" are immensely damaging to society, and they're a frightening direction that I wish we never delved in.
---
Perhaps my analogy is not 100% correct, but.

About the matches and lighters, it's so easy to buy one and light the fire. It's the thing that city authorities and home designers could do to make fire harder to spread (plastic bed linens, prohibit carpets).

And about burglary and rape, someone told me an idea before. Why not issue an official license for criminals, if it needs to many policemen to find and arrest them?

---
Everyone assumes/knows that was for leaking too, that's my point. Manny's not nearly so intrinsically linked with his RL identity, though, so it didn't matter then.  I know it was out there at one point thanks to Digi, but you'd have to actively look for it to connect the two.  That's not the case for Brisc.  I think CCP is pretty much damned if they do, damned if they don't here.  Whether or not they explicitly say it, removing someone from CSM for anything other than inactivity is basically a giant neon "THEY VIOLATED NDA" sign.
---
potato server burn down

Was your friend publicly shamed in a devblog? CCP created the attention and now have to juggle with it.
---
I love it!

Are you saying that he should stay banned even if it turns out he was innocent?

Then lock this region tighter. Ban VPN, open more servers. Oh  wait... It takes money to open a server...

&gt; Nobody forced him to tie his IRL career to a video game.
---
Doesn't matter.
---
&gt;Unless they did something actively malicious (rather than simply negligent)
---
Uh.  People sue over negligence damages all the time.  If they fucked up from negligence, yeah, that's on them, because of course it is you weirdo.
---
This is good news, CCP doesn't need to hack everyone down, even if they made a mistake. It's a game, that we all are trying to play better the everyone else. Mistakes will happen.
---
Read the comments and you will eventually find the answers you are looking for.
---
Are you saying he should stay banned even if it was wrong just because of precedent?
---
Let’s wait a week and see what ccp has to say.
---
Wheres ncpl lol?
---
Was there an initial statement beyond "we banned him" ? I can't remember even that from CCPs side.
---
And did that even change? I know he has been evading the ban, so i doubt CCP would lift it to kind of prove him right...
---
Pierced nips!
---
I suppose that's true, but personally I'd think that impounding the assets and confiscating the isk pending a "Concord investigation" would accomplish that. Basically an in-game way of saying "something looks fishy, we're going to look into this a little to make sure things are okay."
---
Then it should be locked tighter. Sorry man, I dare to suppose, that isk value and PLEX price is just a top of an iceberg. Truth is, people seem not to like foreigners, who stick to each other, do not communicate with others, live in the same space but do not *integrate.*
---
Thanks man &lt;3

In before PanPerium Legacy.
---
Everyone asking for reason = Publicity, seriously ask yourself how far did this news article go? how many millions of people who never even heard of EvE Online suddenly found a digital universe in-which someone like a Washington lawyer could be held accountable to breaching an NDA?!?!  
---
How far will the apology go? no-where near as far as the inital story. CCP couldn't pay for that kind of advertisement.
---
Lets just hold hands and sing Kum ba ya.
---
It doesn't say anything like that, what the literal fuck.
---
Too old for that - more like hobby project.
---
The entire ordeal has however, surfaced the reputation of American Republicans in general. There's a constant push to direct that energy towards Democrats like how Clinton was brought up because that's literally the only thing they have against Democrats.
---
If he's able to carry out an illegal act, then strong arm through it since hrs connected to the Republican party which connects to Putin, it'll force CCP to bend and act like they were at fault, giving the right an image boost.
---
The guy made it political quickly. His entire career was political. He's now in the spotlight and if he's declared innocent, it'll make him look impeccable and the victim which he can use for policies fame. His party can use it to show the world how the right are picked on unfairly. It also gives players a channel towards him and his allies to support. 
---
Innocent or devious, I'd wager he'll be declared innocent if wrong doing and will be untouchable, followed by great amounts of wealth for those around him.
---
There are plenty of reasons why a CSM member can be removed that don't involved the NDA.  Sure, in Manny's case, the leaks were pretty well known before the ban.  But without that knowledge, it could just as easily have been for violating game rules, as an example.  CCP denied themselves/Brisc any of that cover by accusing him directly of violating the NDA.
---
But I still don't want to do your abyssal sites because if my connection fails so does my ship and pod. 
---
Make the site pause on disconnected or server issue.

I'm curious where you saw anyone say anything of the sort.

don't trip, when it wasn't calling primaries it was some of us shrieking bubblebath as our dictors obliged us.

I will be glad to read your interpretation then \^\_\_\_\^

Obviously they were just trying to return themselves and their ships back to their natural state of scrap metal.

This was fun to watch even though I didn't understand everything going on because I'm still quite new and bad at this game.
---
One thing I was wondering however: When looking through the kill logs, specifically the [second Nyx](https://zkillboard.com/kill/76207272/), it lists Norianne in the Ragnarok as Top Damage with 10% but also says she is in the alliance Initiative Mercenaries which is the same as the target, NZ Snake.
---
Am I misreading the kill logs or are alliances quite fleeting in Eve?
---
Have you heard about Kugu?
---
Ya, he should have only gotten a slap on the wrist.
---
Unpopular opinion: they should keep Tibet
---
Jebi is the funniest and most over the top EVE player/FW enthusiast I have ever heard or read.

Yea, its weird that I know you speak english well, read that, and made this statement because nowhere in that do they say "oh guys we fucked up".
---
You're reading shit into the statement thats not there.
---
This is very solid advice.
---
100% agree.
---
It's not hands that are missing.
---
Because they have 2 Malcanis, SB, and Brisc shit talking them on a public forum and calling them liars, its called "getting out in front of a public relations problem".
---
They already went crying to game media.

I haven't read thru this entire post so if this was mentioned I'm sorry in advance, but wasn't serenity several patches behind tq? If that was and is the case then they will have a lot of catching up to do in a short amount of time, which means aside from being bad players as some have stated, they will be way behind in current mechanics.
---
I like the frig brawl/tourney idea and I have another:
---
Pvp pilots need skills to hunt targets such as using dscan effectively.
---
Put someone who knows what's what in a Shiney ship and have your lot hunt him down. Chase him from belts to customs offices, etc. Then when they kill him (you may have to let yourself get caught), they get to keep the Shiney loot.
---
Too many toons have no clue how to effectively dscan.
---
&gt;Brisk let slip some clue about the carrier NSA preventing warp and his guys acted on it.
---
sauce?
---
Get corwin and awc back and sure
---
&gt; We have also been conducting an internal review to substantiate the evidence available to us and evaluate our handling of the situation.
---
Can someone ELI5 what this really means? Either he did it so they banned him or he didn't but why are you investigating *after* the fact. Isn't the order of these things (the investigation and the ban) backwards?
---
tbf, have you seen how CCP fit their ships on dev events
---
&gt;we were not able to break their reps against the 6 guardians
---
why, has he filed suit? otherwise its a non-issue.
---
This would be great over the 45min stargate asmr video, can u extend it by 40mins?
---
Everything you said is complete bullshit.

Fair point for sure
---
Prospect is great as a frigate sized covert cyno in BLOPS.  Endurance is good in a ninja ice miner role.  I have also used Prospect as a ninja Mercoxit miner, properly fitted.

AVG keeps on saying pyfa is "dangerious" (i know it's not). what do?
---
Would take quite a bit, but maybe once things settle down IRL I'll take a looksie! You got a link to the video you're referencing?
---
But CCP didn't earn much of a backlash from the community. It was high profile for sure, but if anyone was shitstormed it was the three banned players.
---
It was also picked up form the gaming media within hours. Maybe because the writer frequents our subreddit, but go back and have a read in that post. You won't see much hate towards CCP. 
---
There was also no news until this to take to the gaming media...
---

---
yesterday: real life lobbyist banned for corruption
---
tomorrow: games studio unfairly bans high profile player without merit.
---
More just a case of, high profile cases and famous/important people get a different treatment. At the end of the day, everything about humans is perception. If something negatively affects people's perception of you, you take more notice. If no one gives a shit about your friend being banned, why should CCP care?
---
I don't like it, but it's just the way humanity is.

Look in to Villore Accords. Not 100% on how they are these days but if they are not the right fit for Gallente FW RP for you, they would be the best people to ask to point you in the right direction.

Great point.  And other possible cultural difference. 
---
Is going on an op with 100+ other pilots fun? Even if the gameplay isn't super-complicated, you get to hang with your corp-mates, shit-talk the hostiles, and watch your killboard go green.  It's a group-activity vs. doing your own thing kinda breakdown.
---
Can I ask how you get around that? I'm guessing VPN but I'm guessing the Chinese Internet Police (Still odd to even imagine something like that exists) doesn't look too kindly upon it?
---
Really?
---
The guy didn't tie is Eve profile to his political career?
---
Clinton was never brought up about the investigation towards his ban?
---
Republicans don't have an image problem and don't constantly being up Bill's blowjob?
---
Republicans have nothing to do with Putin?
---
I'm not being sarcastic here. The entire ordeal got political real quick and he's on the legal offence against CCP. Trump's has a history of legally strong arming.

I get that it's possible to be wrong, but that's the dots I'm seeing.

So the serenity server meta has been supers and titans being really cheap and expendable for years due to their bottling. But they didn't even have rorquals.... like at all. This is going to be ugly.

This is you. Reactionary judgements are stupid, and just because they had evidence at the time, doesn't mean what they did was warranted or correct.
---
This is why courts get both sides of the story before meting out punishment. This is why courts take a little bit of time to come to a decision. CCPs ban process is arbitrary *as fuck* and has needed to be reviewed for a long time. Hopefully this will be the kick in the crotch needed.
---
Nope,we would prefer they "AUTZ" the shit of out of Sort up North.
---
They’re going to join Imperium.
---
I wouldn't be surprised at all if he had a lawyer send them some sort of official letter. That probably got ccp's legal team involved, and this statement is likely the result.
---
are you new to PR speak?
---
I am way more stupid than that, my friend.
---
If you build something official, you make it seem like its acceptable.
---
Its sort of like drugs. If you make a drug legal, you make it seem like the government says its okay even if its bad in some ways.

I’m not ruling out anything that makes their life harder.

Why say that they will own up to and make amends for their mistakes if there are no mistakes?

There is no similiarity to whats being on here at all. Brisc stood up as CSM member with his campaign tight with his RL, signing up NDA which matters really lot in his RL. If he did something, then there is no discussion about, his issue to tight this with his RL. But the last paragraph seems like CCP is preparing their damage control meaning they really fucked up his RL hard and now they are shaking.

Pyfa worries
---
Because they've been being publicly attacked by the banned people and their friends for a week on a public forum? 
---
How does public relations work 101, a course for beginners.
---
No idea. Pyfa itself is python application which is relatively small, but windows build is wrapped into additional software which sets up environment to run it. My guess would be that AVG complains about part of that wrapper. Could you share any detsils?

Nice!

I'm pretty sure before you guys sold out to FRT, your corp would be doing the same thing. Besides, isnt Elo Knight 100% against botting and RMT?

Racism has some tacit approval in eve, as in other games, but that's wholly dependent upon your corporate culture.

This isn't racism, though.  While childish, what's being disparaged here is the Chinese government's reactions to these events.  I mean, seriously, their government censored Winnie the Pooh for fuck's sake.  How are we not supposed to make fun of that?

I doubt it. CCP will probably give the other 2 INIT dudes a shorter ban, and keep Brisc banned. Otherwise they’d have to ban the CSM that tipped them off for lying, right? So, nope, wont happen. As for Brisc rl? Thats his problem, not CCP’s.

Let's jope that if brisc is innocent the other csm's or those which provided the "proof" to ccp get repercursions.

Flying a Goon flair but not (going by the question) with them... :thinking:
---
Anyways, joining any of the major nullsec alliances (through one of their feeder corps) will offer fantastic opportunity to make manufacturing a worthwhile investment. Pretty much everyone uses a small-ish set of fits, so if you make the ships/guns/ammo most used by the alliance in fleets, you're guaranteed sales, and for the most part you marking it up a bit over hub prices will be tolerated or just outright accepted, given it's the price of convenience.
---
Just don't be the asshole that buys up all the stock of a high-use module and then turn around and sell for a significant markup, that sort of buddy fucking tends not to go over too well.
---
As for breadth of activity, most alliances have a significant number of industrial sites spread throughout their space, and on top of that these often have reduced taxes compared to empire space/NPC sites, or less manufacturing resource usage and time taken per job due to installed upgrades.
---
So it would appear. We'll see in a week. 
---
I wonder what they thought this'd do, though? People had calmed the fuck down. It was fading from the forefront of people's minds.

The discussion I had on the sub here regarding ccp doing this shit in a totally wrong way because there is a chance they might be wrong here were unreal.
---
It's only a trap if you don't want to maximise the amount you can earn from PI.  And why wouldn't you.  Train it once and then it's done and you've got an (almost) passive income source for the rest of the lifetime of the universe.

sure was taking long for a common sense zinger to show up, do you post those on facebook too?
---
My honest guess is that it's going to be another corruption or rare spelling of a Slavic mythological term.  
---
But, that said, one of the terms CCPers have loved to use for Drifter ships is 'silverfish,' so perhaps the Triglavians are using a tongue-in-cheek fish reference for the faction that became the Drifters?  
---
Still, my bet's the former, not the latter.
---
PYFA is fantastic. Thank you for taking the time to make and maintain this fantastic product for us.
---
You do realize that there is now a high possibility that ccp fucked up to the point of potentially being SUED. It's one thing you ban someone for eula breach behind smoke and curtains it's another if you ban a lawyer in a public execution.
---
Yea its kinda a maze of 3rd party tools sometimes. If you wanna help in a tiny way point people to coalitionsin.space if they complain the list is out of date. The map is out of date not muh list :’(
---
That's nearly an admission.  If they were trying to set the scene for a future apology, that's how they do it.  If they were trying to be somewhat neutral, then really, they would have said something like "If we did something wrong, we will apologize, and if we didn't, we will affirm that / provide context / etc".
---

Not really though; it was just incompetence on his part. He fired an area of effect doomsday (Boson) that was meant for us but we MJDed away and it ended up damaging that Nyx a fair amount instead. If we had taken the full brunt we would have died.
---
meh, better to let people work themselves off in waves regarding the topic rather than having it go ballistic and cause a PR ripple effect once the bomb drops. this way they can point out that while they fucked up they did their best to resolve the situation and were forthcoming about it. ofc you would have to know that there was a bomb ready to drop for this to make any sense.

This. This is what should have happened. And if ccp wants to infuse some trust into the csm and player base they better tell us wtf happend. But I really really doubt that will ever happen.
---
This post just points out they overreacted to the evidence presented and they're looking at it again. And will apologize if they in deed fucked up.. But whats fucked up exactly!?
---
&gt; There's nothing wrong with them playing a game ruthlessly to win
---
There is if it breaks the rules of the game - and Chinese are generally happy to do that if the rules aren't properly enforced.

THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA
---
Here's some more straws to clutch at.
---
Seriously, how desperate can you be to not be wrong? When have you ever known CCP put in *anything* like that last paragraph except when they dun goofed? What do you think motivated that update? 
---
CCP: "Oh well absolutely nothing has changed, Brisc, Dark and Pando are all 100% certainly guilty as sin, but hey let's post an update saying that' we're "reviewing the evidence" and "if there was any erroneous action on our part" and so on, for *no reason whatsoever".*

---
... wait no, when there's legal issues, you shut the fuck up, pile the amount of lawyers you can afford at it, and say *nothing* until you damn well have to, because there is *nothing* you can make better by involving the public.
---
Well CCP didnt kill him.
---
People have joked that China's president looms like Winnie the Pooh. Of course a strong man type leader can't have that type of joking criticism weakening him, so they've censored mention of the character.
---
https://exceptionnotfound.net/15-fundamental-laws-of-the-internet/
---
TLDR is pretty much they fucked up. My working theory is that whatever claims the other CSM member did is that something lines up with their narrative (but is bullshit) but in practise was an actual fluke and doesn't make sense in practise.
---
From what the playerbase gathers being that the aligation is of people making money from something brisc has passed on comes down to this (taken from alot of sources to be factually correct): Pando is one of the most broke ass fc's in the game and Dark Shines has always been well off so neither of the brisc passed on nda stuff makes sense because nothing has changed.
---
And where in that does it say he should stay banned if it was a wrongful ban? What it says is that you don't blab publicly on the subject, or let the sperg machine know it works to rabble rouse. 
---
You investigate, silently. You correct any mistakes, when necessary, and you stay as terse as humanly possible when making any public noise about it.
---
They already fucked up when they made the initial announcement.
---
Best part is that this entire thing was fishy for me even without distrusting the statement itself. All they had to do is wait 24 hours between the ban and the public execution and we might not be here right now. (a shame for all that drama but oh well.)

CCP didn´t get money for getting sold. That´s not how any of this works.

The Brisc Report, which was written by 9 Angry CSM members who also happen to be Init Haters (and PL Supporters), should have focused on the Mittani who wore a WIZARD hat at fanfest, and others who fabricated the whole LEAKS. That is, never forget, the crime..... The SAD CCP Peligro must answer for his CRIMES. OUT!
---
 Since Brisc Rubal 'was' a RL American politition I fully expect him to file a lawsuit. CCP may be preparing for this. Players have been reinstated before so this is probably a public statement describing internal corprate policy.    
---
FYI: I don't know anything about this particular case and I don't really care about the outcome, but this game was designed to allow and even glorify deceit, treachery, backstabbing, theft, and more. How can anyone be surprised that this could seep into the personas of players in the meat world.
---
I get what you're saying but I've seen other communities spout this stuff not out of wanting to raise awareness of the atrocities and censorship, but in the belief that spamming this would offend the average Chinese person, or get those people banned from the game/Internet.
---
So you eat too much food and have the spare time to post on Internet eh?

Well brisk is a lawyer himself, so why wouldn’t he

Did Bewalk lawyer up?  
---
&gt;But because this fuck gets a bunch of angry reddit nerds he gets a fucking DEVBLOG about HIS BAN?
---
This is idiocy, 90% of the Reddit comments on the subject were not pro-Brisc.
---
The cat would disagree.
---
It think it's valuable in that it says that they understand that they where not clear enough in the initial announcement. That they are at minimun reconsidering the decisions made. And to inform the players that they hear there concerns and are taking the time needed to address them the best they can.  Right, that it does not have any conclusions, but it does provide useful insight IMO.
---
Angry nerds shaking the tree left or right still shakes the tree.
---
Bewalk is trying to save money to lawyer up
---
&gt;It was linked and CCP knew it.
---
So what? It was linked by his publicity push. I don't think that linking your character to your IRL persona creates additional obligations in the part of CCP.
---
Does this make  **Daenerys the "Mother of Cyber Authoritarianism?"**
---
I roomed with a couple of exchange students from the same metropolitan China (I don't recall which precise city) for two years.  Good blokes, but even they were fairly patriotic.  I quite often had to zip-up when it came to China or else risk bad feelings brewing.  Which, fine, fair enough, nobody wants to be around someone that often disparage their country.
---
It's not racist to imply that your average Chinese citizen would get upset by spamming the silly things that their government has done.  Many US citizens get their nickers in a bunch when you bring up the silly things that government has done.  Is that somehow racist as well? 
---
I'd guess you could say it's jingoistic, which, yeah, kinda?  But, honestly, I also agree with region-locking China.  I haven't great experiences gaming with large groups of Chinese gamers.
---
The banned thing is a meme.  A funny one, which is also making fun of their authoritarian government.  Anyone with an iota of thought realizes they're using a VPN.
---
how xenophobic, very problematic and icky sweaty
---
Thank you for your dedication. One thing i noticed is that faction launchers cant load t2 ammo.
---
You realise that you're part of the problem :)
---
Oh come on man, that last paragraph.
---
My point is that while  it would be negligent to ban him before fully investigating the damages would be limited to the amount he paid for the game unless there is some evidence that CCP knowingly made false statements. If they made an honest mistake then it's just unfortunate. 
---
But none of that matters because he'd have to be crazy to sue for defamation.
---
As a high sec carebear, I like this idea.
---
I'll give you one example. 
---
For most of EVE's existence, edgy comments and discussion was commonplace in large groups.  Use of slurs, racist, and homophobic terms was commonplace.  
---
When the corp Brave Newbies was started, they were faced with the issue of how to handle this. 
---
The CEO at the time posted this:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Bravenewbies/comments/1c2vw4/on_the_subject_of_manners_and_other_thoughts/
---
This established the "Stay Classy" principle which basically meant that slurs, racist, and homophobic terms we not allowed Brave.  Plenty of profanity occurs, but not slurs.
---
This principle has causes issues over the years, and we have lost many members who disagreed with this rule and moved to other corps/alliances.  
---
Brave was one the first major groups to break with the previous social norms and establish an environment more welcoming to people, a little more free from verbal attacks. 
---
Today, use of slurs in comms will result in someone speaking up and saying that "we don't use those words" rather than let them go unchallenged.
---
Not sure if that is what you are looking for.
---
You assume alot...
---
If the dick don't taste like it used to, tell your man candy to start eating right.  This is TOTALLY on him.

---
Yeah lol keep dreaming.
---
You never send those letters yourself. The point is to show your represented by impartial counsel and that forces them to deal with said counsel instead of just emailing you a "our bad, here's your account"   
---
They never should have publicly said why they were banned, just that they were.
---
CCP's dev blog didn't go that far, the media took the story that far. CCP didn't post the dudes irl name, media sites did. You can't expect CCP to make amends for the actions of others.       
---
If we have learned anything from this, it's to keep your private life seperate from your online presence. If you cannot manage to do that then don't cross lines online that your not willing to pay for in your real life.
---
I also wasn't aware of what had happened.
---
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+happened+to+brisc+rubal+in+eve+online%3F
---
It seems someone in CSM accused (and supposedly provided some sort of evidence)  Brisc Rubal of sharing some confidential information which was then enacted upon for ill-gotten gains.
---
CCP banned their accounts permanently and banned the accounts of other people for a year and made some sort of official post about it.
---
But the guy is a politician and lawyer (according to the article) and vowed to defend himself.
---
I guess if you are a lawyer and a politician and you try to get some sort of job, any potential employer might perform some background check and see that you're not trustworthy because you share confidential information that was under NDA, so potentially there might be some sort of libel lawsuit, or possibly some sort of defamation lawsuit. Reminds of when hulk hogan sued gawker media.
---
Keep dreaming about..what...exactly?

Is this the war panfam and goon supers will be in the same fleet?

I want to say it's a movie quote or an alteration of a movie quote. Dunno if it was a Quentin Tarantino one or if I'm just making this up. It sounds like something out of pulp fiction but I couldn't find it so I could be completely wrong.
---
No fcs in init after the bans
---
Now how about the market bots?
---
Paragraph 4 wouldn't exist if they weren't saying that
---
Same thing was done in Runescape, and the bots adapted. It would be awesome if it works once and for all, but I doubt it will. And if it ends up taking more dev time than bot writer time, that's a net loss for all of us.
---
You could be right, But that bottom paragraph seems a bit odd to me.

---
I don't know for shit how CCP or Brisc would stand legally. 
---
But morality doesn't have hard cut lines. If enough people find something immoral, it is. 
---
Claiming someone broke his NDA without making sure he really did (just in case it does turn out the allegations were untrue) is shitty no matter which way you look at it.
---
Trying to repair the damage they have done (ingame) is the least they can do for each one of those three *IF*, again, it turns out they were innocent.
---
link the patch notes
---
It also has 3 low slots rather than the Venture's 1 slot. You could argue the Venture gets a +2 to warp core strength and to have the same bonus the Endurance would have to fit 2 stabs leaving only 1 slot, but you could also forgo that and fit more mining upgrade modules, giving you a higher yield.
---
I worked in and ran these kinds of programs for years. My biggest advice is to have 2 sections.  
---
1. You should have verbal instruction/example flown by yourself or a video to take place of the example. 
---
2. You need a hands on test generally where they will be shot at and maybe lose a cheap ship. Give them the adrenaline, the tunnel vision, the feeling of danger so that when they actually fly this role against actual enemies they know what it feels like and are less likely to choke.
---
It will also be really fun gameplay for them to learn these things in such a hands on manner. Once they get over the shakes and the tunnel vision you can move on to more expensive and more complicated topics like micromanagement on the test server to challenge their skills without draining their or your wallets.
---
Thanks! My first time trying to do a more closely edited piece with video, it was a lot of fun to try out, hope to do more in the future if I have time.
---
This would be a next goal, but as my very old teacher said once, take one step at a time. Next step would be to think how to deal with these. I think we need to start somewhere.

FREE MY BOI STUNT!
---
Or you could just go back home fag.
---
It is never ending war with windmills... But that would make it very hard for some bots, who knows, if not all of them... It still open new doors
---
Tbf, I have also idea that CCP could hire a bot maker for hard money to do dirty work against them so they can analyze it... Same as criminal hackers / crakers are hired by governments and security corporations.
---
Actually, they kinda can.  They still have to get PLEX from somewhere, which goes into CCP's pocket.  The can RMT their bot isk to make money on the side, but they will also use up a ton of PLEX, driving more demand.  If they bot ISK into the ground (like they will), buying PLEX will be the only real way to stay relevant for players that don't bot/have a shitload of time to krab on their own.  So the two aren't as mutually exclusive as you'd think.
---
So your saying stunt has a chance.
---
It's not culturally acceptable it's culturally mandated
---
Apparently CCP is more concern in RMT than boting. 
---
I reported a few bots a month ago and you know what, they are still 7*24 ratting.
---
I should have included malcanis in that report I gave to ccp about brisc. Noted for next time.
---
No way. Them putting this out there only fans the flames further as evidenced by all of us speculating. They want this issue to disappear quietly. There's no way they put this statement out without having some inclination that the accusations might have been unjustified.
---
I've heard that it counts SP. No idea if that's true.
---
Current game mechanics and politics essentially lead to a two party system.
---
As an attacker you (eventually) have the option of batphoning or losing the objective, so you batphone (assuming you want your group to grow and not die).
---
As a defender you have the option of batphoning or losing the objective, so you batphone (assuming you don't want to be shrink and die).
---
This process repeats with the people you batphone and who they batphone until the chain gets to an end. At the end is currently either Goons or NC/PL.
---
Groups at the bottom end up getting labelled as pets of either side and are therefor a target of the other side.
---
As a result there are no "strong independent alliances" if they want to survive. Even Goons and NC/PL are dependent on this system as if they lost all of their pets then they themselves would be vulnerable.
---
tldr; even Goons/NC/PL are not "strong independent alliances" that don't need no blues
---
Then we have wormholes, but they don't survive these politics because they can't be evicted, they survive because no one cares about evicting them. Even then eventually as influence grows they have the same problems, case in point HK being "aligned" with NCPL and getting evicted by the Imperium.
---
If you click the ? it tells you where the figure comes from.
---
I didn't know bots could actually make leadership decisions. These chinese AIs are really something else.
---
ah the bonus room lmao
---
Yes, this is the the dark side :) but it could still be one click...
---
I'm out of the loop. Who's Brisc Rubal and why is his ban so big?
---
Wasted on a deleted post though. Pity
---
no u
---
Maybe when the final conclusion is published next week.
---
Just called excel
---
Racism has been always tacitly accepted in EVE tbh
---
CCP should kill all skill injections to stop the flow for a while.
---
P.S unsubbing (again)
---
It says asset value, but I checked my assets through the "personal assets" think on neocom and it doesn't add up to 11b isk.
---
For goons to blue with PIBC is for goons to agree to ruining the rest of eve...
---
Here come the Diamond rats. And they want to kill you....... just you
---
No GoT spoilers please
---
I really fucking hate that the second reply in there I see is from goddamn amakboma
---
I thought he died
---
It includes things like the estimated value of the implants you may have in clones as well as the estimated value of items you have in asset safety. Check those and you might find the items that are reflected in the 11b amount.
---
&gt;Claiming someone broke his NDA without making sure he really did (just in case it does turn out the allegations were untrue) is shitty no matter which way you look at it.
---
True, but its the same risk of shittiness that every player deals with when they sign a EULA (which are always incredibly one-sided).  The fact that he publicly linked himself to his character name IMO does not obligate CCP to take any additional care than they would for any player. 
---
Imagine you have a house (reputation), and a random driver (CCP) plows a truck into it by accident. The driver is liable for the damage. Now imagine that the owner of the house filled the living room (EVE character reputation) with 55gal garbage cans filled with gasoline (linking real name to Eve name), which then explodes. Is the driver liable for all the damage caused by the resulting explosion or is it mostly down to the negligence of the house owner who was improperly storing gasoline? IMO the driver is only liable for what they caused and the fact that the damage was exacerbated by the house owners own separate negligent act shouldn't increase the damages.
---
Obviously the actual legal issues are stupidly complex and depend on Icelandic contract law so who knows, but in terms of fairness I don't think CCP is liable for damage to his personal reputation.
---
Implants / jump clones maybe?
---
CCP should get rid of skill injectors now.. lol
---
everyone would be fine if there was a m*yocide
---
this gives no indication to the scene where the hound finds the lightsaber in the crypts of winterfell.
---
We beat the Russians, we can beat the Chinese
---
Yes I do. Thanks for pointing that out. Now get back to playing STO Apollo
---
You severely lack the imagination of a bot maker.  
---
Local is not required.  Intel bots on Gates can see people entering and leaving the system.
---
Blueprint copies counting as bpo was a thing.
---
This is going to be a disaster. I thought Eve was relaunched in china? Why are they coming here?
---
Never said I wasn't, I just said I wouldn't mind more entities other than the two major ones that we have at the moment. Also, hey some day I might move on, at the moment I enjoy the dudes I fly with, which is the reason I am staying where I'm at currently.
---
I love china. Nothing gets the heart pumping like running students over with tanks in tiananmen square with your best buds.
---
Lol if they don't click it take 15m from them. Wait no never mind, fuck this is entirely.
---
Are you guys coming back to TQ?
---
or, ccp could just police their game properly.
---
Not sure if its user error or what, but when I hit "open fitting browser" nothing happens.
---
Oh, I doubt he'd sue, but just saying: negligence is definitely something that is on CCP if that's that case.  That it was his choice to associate his game persona and his real one doesn't get them off the hook there.
---
You're right!
---
Even those of us who live outside of wormholes respect Bob and reverence Him when we traverse through His domain.
---
having played runescape when that shit was in it... it just infuriated legit players more than bots.
---
chopping a yew tree, go and grab a drink, come back to a broken hatchet. well, thanks jagex.
---
all shit like that does is punish legit players for making the most of poor game design.
---
&gt; How fucking tasteless are you manchildren where you post shit about a massacre as youre le epic spaceship meme to "do your part against the Chinese menace"? How old are you? If its anything over the age of 16 you need to do some serious contemplation about what kind of person you come across as.
---
The bias is against a tyrannical fucking nanny state making one of the greatest series of mistakes since the internet's inception.
---
For what its worth, the article 13 shit in the EU is a crock of shit too. So what does that make me, racist against Chinese AND Europeans as a whole?
---
please give me assets
---
&gt;Intel bots on Gates can see people entering and leaving the system.
---
implying that's the only way to enter or leave systems...
---
Or the autosythians? Matter of fact, I talked to a guy who had his barge ganked by the sleepers while minding his own business mining a losec belt.
---
Yes, he and his priests/priestesses go around offering alcohol shots at player meetups.
---
If they wanted this to go away quietly they wouldn’t have said anything.
---
 But that’s not the point. My point is that regardless of whether they made a mistake, or didn’t, they appear to potentially be staging themselves to backpedal. Even if Brisc broke the NDA, it’s possible that CCP will fold on this given current community climate.
---
Thanks, for now I'm using Stylish with very simple custom css
---
```
---
body {
---
    background: rgba(16, 16, 16, 0.7);
---
}
---
Who did though? Brisc is just a line member in game.
---
Brisc never FC'd in his life tho. Are you thinking of Pando?
---
Yeah but only for what they did. If their negligent act was extra damaging due to his negligence then culpability is shared IMO. CCP would be totally justified invoking the limitation of damages from their EULA. 
---
Don't put your real name on the line in vidja games kids.
---
"we should have a check that only humans can do to stop boting!"
---
You're restating the problem as if you found a solution
---
The problem is that bots can do everything a human can easily do. The more specific the request the more specialized the ai can become and the worse humans become, more false positives making legitimate players angry while not limiting bots in any way. the more simple a request the easier it is for humans, but also for ai, no one fails the tests and bots continue on as they were 1-2 days after patches as they solve the problems
---
He was mining his own business... Never thought sleepers will get it that serious
---
This isn't governmental court system. They don't have to respect any precedent. They are free to be as unpredictable as they wish.
---
&gt;its a fucking meme
---
Aside from how tasteless it is to make the deaths of hundreds of people into a meme, why don't you fucking gooblords spam shit about Chechnya whenever you fight Russians?
---
It's canned corporate-speak, so entirely meaningless. 
---
This sub overreacts to everything.
---
No implants or boosters :/
---
No there is just an invisible /s at the end of that bottom sentence...
---
I heard Frat issued a call to arms to PIBC, Kum Nou Kwik answered
---
Zeropls
---
&gt;I'm pretty sure before you guys sold out to FRT, your corp would be doing the same thing.
---
Literally not, because we've always had a longstanding friendship with Fraternity and also have had Chinese corps in BL. "Sold out" is also a very loose term, did you guys sell out whenever you allied with Goons (the guys who attempted multiple times to smother TEST while they were down on their luck)?
---
&gt;Besides, isnt Elo Knight 100% against botting and RMT?
---
Stones from glass houses. How long did TEST allow KWG and Wing's Wanderers to bot/RMT under their purview? How many people has TEST/Legacy kicked for killing blue bots? Need I remind you what Vily said, that it "did not matter" about the bots in Legacy renters and pets?
---
Don't take the moral high ground and pretend to be part of the "anti-botting" empire when your leadership allows it and rakes in the profits from it.
---
Rose's are Red, Violets are Blue,
---
You should be working, shouldn't you?
---
FREE THE INIT 3!
---
Recaptcha works by pairing your Google account data with your current usage of recaptcha
---
If your Google data suggests a bot they have you search for street lights or something in a picture
---
Or if you click too many recaptchas in given amount of time they have you do the street light finding
---
Wouldn't work for something that happens on regular intervals and without real world data to back it up. I guess CCP could force everyone who is online more than 8 hours/day start finding streetlights for Google 
---
 that doesn't limit clever people though, it only ends up limiting bad botters and players. Clever people make 3 bots in place of 1 and have them up 8 hours/day before switching to the next bot
---
Works for me, if you mean that menu item in fitting panel which is next to ship stats. It opens current fit ship group and selects current fit. Useful only if you have some other ship group selected.
---
To light a cyno you have to BE IN THE SYSTEM. Idiot.
---
What happened to get him permabanned?
---
Botting supers isn't really more content.
---
One always forgets these little details.
---
The trick to haggling is to place 10% of the price in their hand and then try to take the money back when they say no.
---
Civil suit doesn’t have to be beyond a doubt - it’s preponderance of evidence, which means the judge or jury only has to find that the situation is 51% in CCP’s favor to dismiss a suit or 51% in Brisc’s favor to award judgement.
---
Brisc is a gigx alt confirmed.
---
heh ok
---
&gt;The banned thing is a meme. A funny one, which is also making fun of their authoritarian government. Anyone with an iota of thought realizes they're using a VPN.
---
You make a lot of Holocaust jokes to your German alliancemates then? And jokes about Chechnya to Russians?
---
If you make a meme out of an atrocity you're a pretty shitty human being, just own it; don't pretend that you're doing it to "stick it" to the CPC government.
---
I didnt said its good idea... I tried to provoke thoughts, any thoughts :) that is a good one too
---
Ban Hilmar!
---
Papa bless ❤️
---
I think I heard injected skillbooks were included.
---
Because people were trying to hold onto stocks to put them on the market years from now when they would be even rarer, making them a collectible as well as a useful consumable.
---
With an expiration date, holding on to them past that date makes no sense, and waiting too long and misjudging the price means you put a market order up the day before they expire for some amount, they don't sell, and they now are even less valuable.
---
What's happening now are speculators competing with buy orders to try to buy up huge quantities so that they can resell at a (hopefully) profit, as price rises as the expiration date looms.
---
Not sure what the issue was with your fried but the difference between that and this has nothing to do with the ban, or noise in /r/eve from Brisc's friends. This is all about the first devblog.
---
Banning someone unjustly is sad for them and might be bad business for CCP but they have no legal obligation to provide service to you. Ultimately you're screwed and have no recourse. BUT people and companies do have a legal obligation to not publish untrue statements about you that would hurt your reputation unless they have evidence that the facts they're claiming are true. Because of the potential legal liability this situation is very different from your friends. 
---
Based on the interview Brisc gave on TiS I'm assuming he said something he didn't consider to be covered by the NDA while other members of the CSM and then CCP's security team did.
---
Yay more botters!
---
You are the MVP
---
Yeah, that worked real well for Runescape. Except for the part where it'd get worked into the bots within a few days or less, and then they'd be back at it, and that it also was a hassle to normal players.
---
 if on contract.
---
Ok, perhaps its a idea to make a option (in your account) to turn off the background?
---
So theres a few ways to do PI.                                
---
1. I just want a little isk, set up P1 plannets that pull on a weekly and pick up monthly ish, its 10 mins work a month for 200m ish per toon (prices not accurate as i've not done it for 2 years) sell locally to group 4.
---
2. I'm happy to put some effort in but not loads. lots of P1 plannets and a p3 or p4 farm, as above but rather than selling to market you dump it on your production plannet wich increases your isk/m3. about double above sell to local market 
---
3. PI is my life - p1 drills with p2 factories and a p2-p4 compiler plannet, shift shit about daily to max out your iskies, lots of effort for a decent payout sell local or jita.
---
4. I'm a buyback god - buy from group 1 and run P4 factory palnnets making 10m/day ish/ plannet, again its daily runs and annoying when you get your quantities wrong. sell local or jita
---
5. i make fuel blocks - mech componants and robotics i think but like i said its been a while. you build your own bits for your fuel blocks and increase your earnings on that.
---
things to note.
---
1. Factory plannets should be on small plannets as your runs take more pg on larger plannets
---
2. peak yeald drops off after a few cycles but is still ok
---
3. restarting pulls early will depleate the plannet
---
4. look at POCO tax rates before starting if your not locked to a nul alliance
---
5. setup is key it takes a while but you do it once and then its just a couple of clicks to restart cycles
---
6. hit submit or it ignores all that work you just did.
---
Gang up? Please, all of the empires these days care only about one thing: wallet pings.
---
So the empires will do the one thing that will help them amass massive wealth even if that means doing fuck all with the isk except smug about it. People will be happy to blue these guys so long as their wallets are fat regardless of whether or not there is content to be had.
---
I welcome our new overloads!!!
---
signed tigger
---
Your comment is retarded, both of them
---
Like everyone said you need to keep it fun and engaging (so no long lectures without context). Also, the only way you'll get people better is by giving them the means to practice whenever they want. Not just during fleets or classes. But whenever they want to. So most importantly, teach them to be self-reliant and how to find content on their own. 
---
Furthermore, make sure you do your research for fits/whatever. Like, ask in BSB. Message popular youtubers asking for advice. Ask the experts (lol bsb) because they're nice. 
---
--------------
---
I'd start off with teaching them how to brawl. Do an initial thunderdome type thing (handout a variety of 5 t1 brawling frigates) with a top 3 finishers prize. Then, do a short talk about range control/tracking/strengths and weaknesses of all those 5 frigs. They want to win this time, so they'll listen and try to apply that knowledge they got. 
---
Do a second thunderdome with another prize pool so they can get another crack at it with this new information. 
---
Then give them some brawling fits for hunting VNI's/ratters (probably some assault frigates/t3d's/faction cruisers/etc). Show them some spots near you on the map to go hunting. How to use the map/external tools for finding systems to find ratters in that region. Give a prize to the top 5 killers for kills with 5 or less people. 
---
---------
---
To teach kiting, split the class in two. Half of which are brawling ships, the other in kiting ships. Give the brawling team some hyena's and ramjags for tackle. Give the kiting team a keres and an inty or two.
---
Have them fight it out with very very basic instructions as to how the fuck their comps work. Do two rounds so they can try the brawling and kiting side. 
---
Then give a more in-depth explanation. 
---
Have them do it again. 
---
Then give them some kiting fits and comps they can roam with. 
---
-------------------------
---
For homework from the last class, ask the students to come up with a fleet concept. Make a strawpoll for the fleet comp suggestions and go with the winner. Go on a roam with it with you as an FC. Eat shit, talk about its strengths and weaknesses, then have them do the same for next week. 
---
Pick another one of the new submissions from the strawpoll, roam with it and do the same process as last time. This time, to mix things up, rotate who the FC is every half hour.
---
More like cancer progressed to the final, untreatable stage.  Bet CCP's praying they get the other half of their buyout before the Chinas arrive in force.
---
mine was out by 800b the other day, now reading 6b on my super toon that has JF, caps and supers. pinch of salt.
---
They shit up Serenity enough that even they don't want to play there.  So now they're coming to our servers to shit things up anew.  Business as usual.
---
You are my kind of bastard.
---
&gt; CCP can ban high profile people, they just need to do their research first and make sure that the ban is based on facts.
---
No, CCP can ban high profile people all they want with no research or facts. But if they issue a press release about it *then* they need to do their research first and make sure what they say in the press release is based on facts.
---
You only linked the stream mate. Not when it happened.
---
No, because the current German government is not the Nazis.  Nor does their current government even like or support the past Nazi rule.
---
I joke about Crimea to my Russian friends, you're damn right.  I also joke about their policy on homosexuals, despite the fact that I am bi-sexual myself and would be in some danger if I were in Russia.
---
You're the one who seems to believe that I'm making fun of Tienanmen Square.  I'm not.  I'm lampooning, deriding, and being contemptible of the government that allowed (and is still suppressing knowledge of) that event.  If you can't see the difference, I can't help you.
---
&gt;  CCP has been doing more to eliminate bots 
---
Ahahahahahahhahahaahhahahahahah \*breathes\* hahahahahahhahaah.
---
Where is this From?
---
It wasn't really an 'AFK check', at least not for mining.  Mining elementals (from which precious ore could be obtained) were stupidly overpowered; a truly broken mechanic.
---
Fishing (for treasure chests) was purley anti-botting though, hence sea serpent spawn was changed (have to kill it to get chest).
---
I think In Eve there are several types of botting, so there wouldn't be a single solution.
---
However, having fueled cloaking devices seems reasonable.  They did it for fleet boosting after all.
---
Justice for Nolak
---
the horror that would be, they'd increase the plex prices by 10k isk
---
Yes, but I would prefer cookie based option.
---
The word if is not in play. I think they are acknowledging an issue on their part.
---
Me: laughing as the bed Brisc made burns with him in it.
---
Or install a local delay. Bam. All bots are now huntable and the combined autism of hunters crushes them.
---
Fuckin casuals ruining the game
---
Complaining about ritual murder now, tomorrow making complaints about stockpiling cadavers.
---
Where? Between the lines somewhere?
---
Isent that wat gons are al about
---
Finally, two new science skills!
---
Just what every Eve player has been begging for, for years!
---
Thanks CCP!
---
Can i have your stuff
---
this is a new level of bait
---
this is to go even further beyond
---
Except when we are.
---
Like when it comes to shooting northerners.
---
Yes, such toxic things such as 
---
- Reimbursing newbro ships after we kill them out of love
---
- Signal cartel (pacifists in a bloodstained universe)
---
- BFR support group
---
- Extraordinary steps taken to keep people who develop/have disabilities in the game (Thinking of the special controls for people with resting tremor and such)
---
but can it actually assign a value to my titans and supers?
---
How big is pibc?
---
Free Stunt!
---
&gt;And pardon my naivity, are we that far that they can simulate complex human recognivity?
---
I'm not sure what you mean by 'complex human recognivity' but try thinking of something that humans can do quickly and easily that ai can't do faster and more efficiently
---
Seconded.  Looks interesting.
---
June 4 1989. enjoy your arrest and ban now that you've seen this text.
---
Bingo. Given that Brisc has broadly hinted he's considering a lawsuit there's zero chance that CCP's lawyers weren't on the line and more likely leading the discussion when they finally talked to Brisc. Whatever was said in that conversation led to this new dev blog.
---
Well, he tried to run for elected office as a republican. i won't be apologizing for calling him what he is: a sad, stupid political wog who needs to get fucked over repeatedly.
---
If its hot inside, have no windows and are a member of CCP you're probably in a Sauna.
---
The Orville had it perfectly on their episode about social media in the first season
---
My alts don't stockpile cadavers. Though I can't speak for my alt's alts.
---
Beautiful, top notch shitpost! Would upvote again.
---
Please put D3vil's as a third party thanks
---
really bad opinion, go back to mining retard
---
Of course, but once they set the precedent, the sperg machine will only rev harder and *then* denying them after setting the precedent... 
---
... well, it's not like Eve players have a tendency to massively overreact with dramatic gestures and burning down the game for everyone else, is it?
---
fuck it. the bait is too good. Can we keep NDA'd information to yourselve?
---
You might be right. [https://i.imgur.com/WYkygNQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/WYkygNQ.png)
---
Context is needed. With pics, preferably.
---
dat Aurora Blue Dream amirite???
---
Pardon me, what is local delay?
---
This is entirely possible, but do keep in mind that CCP would in all likelihood have lawyers do their legal paperwork, including any NDAs. That's the kind of thing higher-ups tend to insist on, exactly because of situations like this.
---
Not 100% sure, but my guess would be "Person of Interest". Excellent show, btw.
---
Fixed the screenshot
---
Hey, have you considered adding the t2 ammo to faction guns as a secondary or temporary pyfa download until the patch happens in may, I know that a bunch of people would be interested in using that for fittings

" I don't really care about the outcome, but this game was designed to allow and even glorify deceit, treachery, backstabbing, theft, and more. How can anyone be surprised that this could seep into the personas of players in the meat world."  
---
You are running with the "because it happened in a video game people will do it in real life because they can't help themselves" argument?
---
Spai?
---
Yeah I had that happen once and was searching like crazy for hours to find my valuable gems. Understandably I was quite disappointed when I found out.😝

That's amy acker from doll house. Going to guess alias.

Ah so you chose to act retarded even though you knew better.

I can think of thousands ideas, but do you have on mind ai couldnt recognize?

Thought this was about North Korea

If it turns out CCP got this wrong maybe its time a Pearl Abyss supervisor be sent to Iceland to be in charge of "quality control."
---
CCPlz

take the toilet; throw it off a cliff.
---
rice-eyed chink
---
I don't have any contracts up, very confused &gt;:(
---
It is definitely a cultural issue.  You can see it by playing ANY competitive online game.  It's a problem when the cultural drive to "win at any cost" includes breaking the rules.
---
You clown, it would have had zero impact on his IRL life if he himself had not made that public. That's his fault, you can't blame CCP for that. Nowhere does CCP list anything about Brisc except his in-game name. If he hadn't made that connection, any potential employers or clients of Brisc would not have known about this.
---
noobman suffered the same consequence, with no impact on his IRL life. Because he didn't make that public.
---
If you're disagreeing with those facts then you're arguing that I gain additional protections by making my IRL life known
---
yeah, that's where i got the idea.  as some random nobody casual line member, i'm seriously considering re-subbing and fighting for the Init if Brisc was framed and is found innocent.
---
Botting is currently part of the eve economy. If you remove it, the markets will collapse. 
---
There are ways to check for bots, but FFS CCP, if someones online 24/7 barring downtime doing things, they are either account sharing or bot.
---
fly gallente into that wormhole

you seem mad

Whip out your 1400mm howitzer i guess

Yea bud, for sure, after a week of people screaming for proof how dare they say they're going to review it.
---
Tell me Malc, what happens if they come back and say the bans stick?
---
report bar owners to the authorities for promoting racism
---
Incorrect, you post this after a week of people screaming for proof and or calling you a liar.
---
arent sleepers aggressive if they scan you and you got corpses in cargo or is that a myth
---
The only readable part there is `395604061`. Let's hope it's number of players they are going bring to TQ.
---
Am Chinese, fully understand this is satire towards the Chinese government and not Chinese people. These are all terms the government censors. If the spam was about slant eyes or eating dogs, that would be racism against the Chinese people. This isn't that.
---
Asking the important questions
---
Then explain why there are so many "I wish Chinese people stay within their walls" and "VPN cannot stop the horde" commonts in this subreddit
---
sock puppets is cheating.
---
CCP is not doing anything about bots, you can be reported day one and still make enough back for the skill injectors by the time you're actually banned. 
---
Don't want ISK taken away, just have an alt take the ship from the corp hangar since that's apparently all it takes for CCP to stop following the ISK trail.
---
Test the Gollum of Eve confirmed.

this is the type of story that Eve needs in the news.  It pulls the curtain back further that this game is more than just what happens on the servers, it shows how far players will go to use whatever venues of real in person social structures are available to enact revenge or gain an advantage.
---
Using the meta game to totally embarrass CCP and the CSM is the only satisfactory explanation to me for this entire episode.
---
Are the bot hunters Ivanka Trump?
---
&gt;f sharing GM communications is bannable,
---
you know what I meant, you rascal
---
Oh, it's certain that the lawyers wrote the NDA. What's not clear is were any of those lawyers involved in the decision to ban and publish a press release.
---
It's appreciated, trust me. I fell asleep pretty often when I was orbiting a stargate/wormhole when I was younger.
---
Good times.

I somehow doubt it. They broke the cardinal rule. Shut the *fuck* up and let the lawyers handle things, and only speak when absolutely necessary.
---
That's one of the exact things I've had in mind lately. Good episode.
---
Well this doesn't make much sense. How do you think the RMTers are getting the ISK to sell? One method is definitely botting.
---
Mostly because Russia don't block any mention of Chechnya on the internet.

so what

 WHEN DO WE BEAT CHINA AT THE FIREWALLS THEY'RE LAUGHING AT US AT OUR STUPIDITY AND NOW THEY'RE BEATING US ECONOMICALLY THEY ARE NOT OUR FRIENDS BELIEVE ME BUT THEY'RE KILLING US ECONOMICALLY TRANQUILITY HAS BECOME A DUMPING GROUNDS OF EVERYBODY ELSE'S BOTS IT'S TRUE AND THESE AREN'T THE BEST AND THE FINEST WHEN CHINA SENDS IT'S PEOPLE, THEY'RE NOT SENDING THEIR BEST, THEY'RE NOT SENDING YOU THEY'RE NOT SENDING YOU THEY'RE SENDING PEOPLE THAT HAVE LOTS OF BOTTERS AND THEY'RE BRINGING THOSE BOTTERS WITH US THEY'RE BRINGING BOTTERS AND RMTERS AND CHANAMANS AND SOME I ASSUME ARE GOOD PEOPLE BUT I SPEAK TO CCP GUARD AND THEY TELL US WHAT WE'RE GETTING AND IT ONLY MAKES COMMON SENSE IT ONLY MAKES COMMON SENSE THEY'RE NOT SENDING US THE RIGHT BOTS IT'S COMING FROM MORE THAN CHINA IT'S COMING FROM ALL OVER CHINALAND AND IT'S COMING
---
Well there is a part people are forgetting here.
---
This wasn't an internal CCP investigation. the CSM brought this to CCP's attention.
---
So if it turns out that Brisc is innocent either someone on the CSM was given faked info, brought it to the CSM. The CSM not wanting to earn a rep as another one of "Those" CSM's did what was required and flagged it to CCP. Who took the CSM at their word, acted upon the info without verifying it and then decided to publicly announce it on their Dev Blog (A step never taken before for any banning.) and now have enough concerns about the info to lay the groundwork for an apology.
---
OR
---
Someone on the CSM used their position to knowingly give fake to CCP to tarnish the name of another CSM member. He/She raises the issue with the CSM, CSM goes to CCP. Who took the CSM at their word, acted upon the info without verifying it and then decided to publicly announce it on their Dev Blog (A step never taken before for any banning.) and now have enough concerns about the info to lay the groundwork for an apology.
---
Or Brisc is guilty. But considering how quiet CCP are about things like this, the fact they even admitted to a review happening is a very obvious pointer to how this will go.
---
Just cause someone points out a cultural fact doesn't make it a personal problem. 
---
Winning is one thing, doing it dirty is another. 
---
You can win a race by running faster or you can win a race because a friend of yours tripped the racers with a rope.

stop showing us how beautiful EVE can be. it might start looking like enjoyable experience
---
Flag accounts who use a VPN and temp ban them for a week when they try to rat in anomalies.
---
Flagged accounts also can't buy plex from the market.
---
That would get rid of most chinese ratting bots. Sure, some people would switch to hosting companies to set up their own VPN on a VPS or dedicated server. But you could report them ("Report Bot"), a GM looks up the IP and adds the IP range to the database of known VPNs if it belongs to a hosting/VPN company.
---
This is one of the first intelligent comments I've seen, so far.
---
Temp ban for the duration of the investigation. Apology or permaban depending on the results. EZPZ
---
Regardless of their findings, this whole thing is a mismanaged shitshow.
---
They can't meta-game me if I meta-game myself first!! ::thinking::    
---
XD
---
Frankly that is exactly why I was kind of annoyed at the situation from the beginning. Either tell us everything and forfeit the advantage of EULA signed we can ban you for whatever we want (while they could still actually do that it would hit them hard in the PR) or tell us nothing, as they have the right to do. This half-way tell us some but not follow up thing was pretty terrible. I'm glad they're actually gonna  follow up now and tell us what really happened, though it's starting to seem like damage control on their end, not that CCP are strangers to that concept.

I could have said the sky was blue and grass is green and some neckbeard, like yourself, would have came in and said "But Ackchually it's not".
---
Yes, ventures are killable. No where in this thread did I say they were invincible. But you still felt the need to say "But Ackchually I've caught plenty", and guess what? Me too.
---
It's amazing that people who play Eve still might harbor the illusion that the universe is fair.
---
Tell me Grath, what happens if they don't?
---
I deleted my response, sorry if it took your with it..
---
We get a 4 page summary. Nothing more.
---
CCP still have a duty of care to ensure anything they **PUBLICISE** (The publicise bit is important. Its how CCP announced the ban not the ban itself.) about him is correct and true. (Even if the dumb fuck doxxed himself.)
---
If they had just kept this to a forum post and said here's what happened to char x. They would have been fine. Hell I doubt they would even have looked at the info for a 2nd (Or possibly 1st time if the new update is going the way I think it is.) time as they kept it to a private chat board and didnt PUBLICLY announce it to games journalists.
---
Because they put it on their Dev Blog which its technically public viewing (As opposed to a private invite only forum) and because the Dev Blogs are sent out as updates in multiple formats  (RSS feeds, mail lists etc) to games journalists legally that would be considered part of an ongoing marketing campaign for their product. And you 100% need to ensure you are ONLY putting out details you KNOW to be true in those.
---
I can 100% guarantee you that once this is done (No matter how it turns out.) the Dev blog will NEVER be used to announce or discuss Bans again.
---
No worries friendo.
---
But you do know him?
---
Pffffft. No they didn't. This statement says nothing, and starts to establish a timeline on when CCP might feasibly know that something they said wasn't true. Which begins to establish a lower bound on how culpable they are for damages to someone's reputation.
---
I'll be honest, I don't know what CCP's lawyers would want the company to say at this point, but it's not this.
---
don't forget to activate your mwd to burn away from the bomb faster

---
Sure they were the reason CCP are now backpedalling. not the fact they might have jumped the gun or have info that what they were told is wrong but the huge wave of "Fuck Brisc, he's just a Goon" that r/eve has been spreading since he was banned has made CCP reconsider their decision because...................??????????

Giving money to a company with a dysfunctional customer support system is beyond me. This is a step in the right direction, now please do the same to the rest you casually ignore ccp.

Did we ever learn who told CCP what? Because I doubt GSF CSM folks would have been the ones to do that.

He's you?

---
They have to talk publicly because for the first time they announced a Ban publicly.  
---
The Dev Blog site is also RSS'ed and email listed to 1000's of people worldwide including games journo's.
---
They made it public. They **have** to publicly apologise if they screwed up.
---
And about the High Level bans, check that the intel is valid BEFORE banning and maybe dont go shouting it from the rooftops incase its not?
---
If you come to GE-8JV and ask in local for an honorable 1v1, you'll probably get it. We have a PH player named Alexa that comes by every so often and duels Brave folks at the sun. There's also a chance you'll get blobbed by standing fleet before you can say anything, but that's the risk you take. You'd be surprised how many good fights you'll get just asking people.

Also yes.

Excuse me, but welp squad is the premier sig of Goonswarm Federation.

no, we haven't.

however with the majority of the CSM being Goons and CCP saying a substancial evidence from CSM.   chances are some of them are involved.
---
course it would help to know what he did
---
Brave and Horde right next to the Eve logo
---
Actually if they had announced it on the EVE-o forums instead of the Dev Blog they would have been ok too. As the info was restricted to a permissions based forums with restricted access it Legally seperate from a "Published" piece.
---
However The Dev Blog is both A) Open to be viewed by the public without restrictions, B) Is considered part of the ongoing marketing campaign for the Product and C) is emailed and Rss'd to games Journalists when updated.

Perhaps this has been in the pipe for a while.  Potentially a contributing factor to the recent rises in PLEX and injectors as they started to buy up before a public announcement
---
Because they've won EVE on Serenity quite some time ago already. There's nobody to fight for them. Their enemy, Fraternity, is on Tranquility already. Serenity peaks at 3k characters logged in daily, imagine how empty it's got to be there.
---
I just want the translation in what was actually said...
---
Pretty sure the forums have read-access without logging in, no?
---
not following you
---
are you still saying test is terrible for breaking an imagined alliance between legacy and tri?
---
or are you talking about test being bought and paid for by maintaining their alliance with drf (the one that helped them get their current space in the south)?
---
"Are you the new r/eve retard"*
---
USA USA USA AHAHAHAAAA
---
So, what I'm saying is that 
---
isk spent to plex an account &lt; isk generated by that account
---
Always.
---
Let's say those numbers are 2bil and 5bil (just as an example).  If someone is RMTing, CCP is getting the 2bil to plex the account, but MISSING OUT on potential sale of the 5bil, because the RL currency exchanged for it is going to the botter.  Literally, it doesn't matter how many botting accounts are paying CCP, they fundamentally have to be plexed for less value than they are earning, or the botters would go out of business.
---
Put a different way, if everybody bought THE SAME amount of isk from CCP alone as they are already buying from bots, CCP would make more money than from plexing the bot accounts.  There is literally never a financial incentive for CCP to allow bots.  It only hurts them.
---
I mean, the exact phrasing is "we will issue an apology for any mistakes for which we are responsible"
---
If no mistakes were made, there won't be any reason to apologize, so it means the exact same thing as "if we made a mistake we will apologize"
---
I remember when this was all white space. Hanzo switch pls

I hear there is really cheap space in period basis these days, or you could just go and play pubg for the next two weeks and rebuild later lol

---
yikes
---
Eve does not have a problem attracting new players.  It does however have a significant problem with *keeping* new players.
---
The newby systems are always full.  And CCP themselves stated that they get hundreds of new accounts weekly, they just cant keep people logging in after the honeymoon period wears off.
---
As much as the bittervets will rail against it, more diverse and more *safe* PVE is the only future this game has.  Hardcore PVP games are niche for a reason.
---
Boring AF. Contrived AF. Broken AF. Unbalanced AF.
---
Only if you view everyone in the CSM as equally likely to send whatever was sent to CCP, to CCP. That's obviously not the case, though, unless the evidence is both accurate and credible.
---
And we've learned today that even CCP thinks that might not be the case.
---
They recently updated them all again for every pirate factions. You have to have them on grid, and be some 50 km at least, ten you will hear their comms/chatter. Same for concord/faction police when you pass near them on gates.
---
You think the Goons would even hesitate in blueing them up?
---
50 km is 31.07 miles
---
&gt;I can think about thousands ideas
---
lets hear one
---
&gt;do you have on mind something ai couldnt recognize?
---
if resolution available to the ai is less than required by the image then they can't recognize it. this would also flag every human as a bot though, because the resolution available to humans would have to be that available to bots.
---
but that's not the goal, the goal is to find something that humans can reliably (sigma &gt; 3) recognize or solve that ai can not
---
no, i don't think there's something that humans can reliably recognize that ai can't. i'm looking forward to hearing your ideas though
---
If goons get the chance to blue someone, they blue them
---
Join TNT instead
---
But. Easy prey to welp on.
---
You don't. But CCP does not have to allow VPNs, in fact many other companies ban you for using one.
---
Is it fair? No, but CCP is not able to get rid of bots otherwise and in my opinion it is worth it to restrict VPN users to reduce the number of bots.
---
Chinese people can choose to play without VPN and therefore without restrictions on Serenity when it relaunches.
---
Does the russian goverment still block access to Amazon services?
---
Haven't read anything about it since they published the news 1 year ago.
---
Well since the contingency is pretty remote, what the hell. If CCP double down then I, knowing what actually happened, will lose respect for them for letting themselves get metagamed into banning a CSM for doing what CSMs have rightly and correctly done since day 1. 
---
And then get on with my life.
---
You, on the other hand, had best stock up on hot sauce and mouthwash, because I hear raw crow doesn't taste that great. I look forward to your grudging and insincere apology.
---
Find a rust bucket instead.

New Allies for Test?
---
FYI a sniper tengu has less than 2k alpha and only a dumbass would sit there watching a tengu wait out the decloak delay, lock time, and then take 3 vollies.

You could download jEveAssets and check in there. It allows you to easily see where your most valuable assets are, amongst a host of other super useful information.
---
what regions exactly did you have in mind?
---
Feel free to point out where CCP publicly accused Noobman of breach of contract.
---
And yes, it's obvious that Brisc allowing that tie increased the potential damage to himself.  It really just doesn't fucking matter.  He's free to do that. 
---
CCP made the accusation, and if it's false, it's 100% on them for not being more careful.  
---
As I mentioned in another comment:  Would I say that giving up enough info in a livestream such that someone could track down my address?  Of course, yes.  I'm exposing myself to more shit than I'd be comfortable with.
---
If I get swatted, however, are you seriously going to argue that it's "my fault" and not the person who made the call?
---
Well, from their point of view, they *really* should. Geopolitics being a thing and all, Tibet is a vital strategic location for them and the source of damn near all their water, as well as a defensive spot against the Indian side of the mountain ranges. 
---
When on top of that they don't really hold human life in any particular regard, nor lofty ideals like various forms of freedom etc, they really have no reason not to keep it. 
---
Another interesting part of their mindset is that they have significant control over the public discourse, and when they see western celebrities and so on campaign for a Free Tibet, they take that basically as western nations interfering with their sovereignty etc. Celebs not being official sockpuppets not even occurring to them.
---
Basically, China's growing power in the world financially and politically is an actual genuine source of concern, because they already went *deep* dystopian and wouldn't hesitate enforcing it on others if they could.
---
&gt; Cheat, steal, lie... The Chinese way.
---
gamers everyone

Like goons wouldn't just mass recruit more than they already do.

N+1 is the sad reality of the game.

Also with the release of the changes to trig stuff today, it could be that CCP can finally release more info. If the trig changes were what was leaked, CCP would now be free to reveal that

" As should be expected, we will issue a full and frank apology for any mistakes for which we are responsible, as well as provide appropriate reparations to those affected by any erroneous actions we’ve taken. "  
---
 You don't put words like that in an announcement unless you anticipate needing to make an apology in the following announcement. Meaning CCP went from "he did it", to "fuck did he do it or not?" in the space of two weeks. Meaning someone jumped the fuck out of the gun and then made it worse by announcing their rush to judgement.

You didn't before?

interesting takes miner
---
I haven't found this to be the case, myself. Plugging in an Asklepian set dropped my reported net worth by ~2.5bn, for example.
---
It also doesn't seem to count any modules that are fit on ships. My worth bloomed a significant amount last time I moved, in correlation with unfitting faction / deadspace mods and moving them separately.
---
When I add up my clones, implants, and assets I end up with almost double what the "Net Worth" reports. Other people find that the value is significantly over-reported. Given how wildly inaccurate it often seems to be, it's ultimately just kind of a meaningless number.
---
Source? Did you sorted nullsec by pilots currently docked and active, or what?
---
At a guess, because every MMO in the history of the PRC allowing MMOs has had a ridiculously high value of Chinese (yes, Chinese, ethnic Chinese, from China) players who do rmt and/or give less fucks about the ethics or legality of botting. That's the botting part.
---
The other problem is that a significant portion of the Chinese playerbase will no longer be within the gated community that is Serenity that is overseen by the Chinese entertainment industry, and that coming into the global TQ server will lead to the Chinese government attempting to pressure CCP into following its (by most other countries' measure) draconian propaganda rules.

No it would be.

wooshed by me i guess
---
There's that, and the historical point that Tibet has been under the iron rule of a Buddhist cult run by feudal warlords with a long list of atrocities of their own in that country. No bastions of enlightened tolerance here. Couple that with declaring that whatever Hollywood star will pay attention is a reincarnated saint (or tulku, Seagal is not the only one) and it just gets silly.

It took days of investigating the logs to realize the handle they thought was brisc on the discord had never mentioned cherry picking and thus wasn’t even a goon.

And yet it happens over and over again. Horde had a moon mining fleet in BWF and I literally just sat on a ping and warped in to pop a different venture every few minutes until I killed almost all of them one by one.

 TOTAL NET WORTH INDICATOR
---
&gt; A character's Total Net Worth is a sum of the following:  
---
&gt;\- The total sum of the estimated market price of a character's assets. This includes any items that the player owns in Stations or Upwell Structures, items located in outstanding sell orders on the market or contracts, and those in a character's Asset Safety system.  
---
\- The total sum of all escrows in a character's currently outstanding buy orders on the market.  
---
\- The total sum of all escrows in a character's currently outstanding contracts.  
---
&gt;Some assets are however not taken into consideration for a character‘s Total Net Worth:  
---
&gt;\- Blueprints do not count towards a character‘s Total Net Worth.  
---
\- Any skill books that have been injected do not count towards a character‘s Total Net Worth.  
---
\- Corporation assets do not count towards a character‘s Total Net Worth.  
---
&gt;The asset estimate is based on average market prices and is updated every 12 hours.

It is still an issue
---
Why would I apologize again, and for what?  Before you answer, reread every response that we've had in our conversations, I'd hate for you to continue accusing people of things you can't substantiate.
---
My stance has been pretty consistent on the entire issue, on top of that, you're literally somebody who has openly admitted to getting an early advantage through CSM knowledge.
---
Stellaris or Div2
---
and CCP can go back to letting people scream til they're blue in the face while ignoring them.
---
reddit wasn't what made them reverse course on this decision.
---
EULA/TOS are not law. they get thrown out by judges a lot of time.

That seems about right. CCP isnt even involved in fixing whats killing the game.

No one has the platform to protest bans. This is special.....

PIRAT "ruling" highsec, lol. being forced to bail like little bitches from a bunch of highsec miners.
---
Yea, if only they made those. Then one wouldn't have to deploy an entire alliance several regions away to defend renters. They should really think about adding something like that.
---
Where did you quote that from?
---
I hope it was a setup.  CCP's CSM baby filling a diaper full is an epic karma blowback.
---
son of a... upvote.
---
No this is them saying, we don't think we screwed up, but after more than a week of looking at what we did there's enough gray area there that we need to make a statement saying we will apologize if we actually in fact did screw up. Which is a nice way of saying they know they are wrong they just don't know HOW wrong yet.
---
&gt; True, but its the same risk of shittiness that every player deals with when they sign a EULA (which are always incredibly one-sided). The fact that he publicly linked himself to his character name IMO does not obligate CCP to take any additional care than they would for any player.
---
Maybe, but they didn't treat him the same way as any other player, or CSM for that matter...
---
\*balls, or did you have an accident?
---
Ah, waaaay back in the day, then.
---
I hear dead-end systems make for tier stagers.
---
Was a play on the Jagex Fucks Up Every Month one lmao

We are not talking about killing. we are talking about using privleged info to cheat ingame. He got caught. He got removed. Good riddance.
---
The problem is how much of Eve is requiring very low effort and intelligence, so it's easy to AFK or multibox (problematic) and bot (very problematic). Eve PVE needs to be much more stimulating and difficult, and that would also make it much harder to bot.

Ok

I definitely see what you are saying but in today's age of internet security I feel (and I wish there were good stats out there) of many legit players this would affect. It might lose CCP more money by disallowing the real players vs the gain "community praise" gained from limiting botting.
---
sucks for the mercs, good for the rest. :-&gt; "what a pity they need to commit actual risk and are forced to fight in a war to maintain it"  - i do have a different opinion on this

If it turns out to be untrue, what does that say about the CSM members who reported him?

Never not drink or play the banjo.  But only play the banjo when drinking is involved.

so your solution for people playing a game in a way you don't like is to change the game so they can't play the way they like anymore?

sounds like you want a different game, not a fix for the current game.

Are you characterizing him as someone who was insider trading simply because Brisc told his alliance what he says actually happened, or is there something else that I missed?

Lmao

I think people mostly just wanted to mock someone for being a spacelawyer. 
---
Brisc just happened to be a real lawyer this time with a real legal case.

Can anyone explain this meme?

This. I can agree with 5 planets tho but you do NOT need upgrades 5.. I trained it.. Then promptly extracted it as it gave me maybe one or two more factories. Which isnt great for someone who does it off and on. 
---
I can agree tho that if its something you actually enjoy.. Idk how.. But if you do.. Then yea get upgrades 5.. But it's really not worth it.
---
Yeah it was pretty in style to hate Brisc, so it went along well with the narrative. Really you shouldn't be surprised, considering how this sub acts.

I'd just teach them about optimal range of weapons &amp; the different types propulsion, tackle so they understand brawl vs. kite vs. anti-kite. those basics plus overheating is more than enough to start and to win a lot of fights.

Once they've figured that out you can start worrying about other modules and more advanced concepts.

What was really said: Going to be really disappointed if there is no truth to support this accusation because I don't like Brisc and want to see him punished regardless of innocence or guilt.

Dont ocd over it tho. Imo PI burn out is the most common. Its easy to reset extractors tho so try and do the shipments  weekly at most, or youll find yourself in an epithal far to often.

To that effect, I personally run my extractors for 3-4 days and just run 2-3 storage facilities. (Side tip dont route extractors directly to factories go ext&gt;storage&gt;fac I know duh.. But it doesn't tell you)

&gt; It should be noted that this isn't actually possible.

True that there is no way to completely eliminate it and it is a constant back and forth ongoing struggle, but you don't have to have entire game systems and extremely poorly thought out mechanics (if at all) that make it easier instead of more difficult for bots to operate.

Also, they don't need to be entirely eliminated, jsut brought down to a manageable levels. And that is entirely possible. Only impossible due to lack of willingness and commitment.

Chinese players are more likely to use bots. That's not racism, that's facts.

There's a difference between poor "due process" and "gross negligence", which was what I was responding to originally.  I don't even really disagree that CCP's ban process is far too opaque.  But if they had evidence that pointed to his breaking the NDA and weren't deliberately ignoring exonerating evidence, that's not grossly negligent, especially in the context of continuing to review new evidence he came forward with.  You don't start a murder investigation by asking the suspect about it, you gather evidence and arrest him, then ask for an alibi and any exonerating evidence he has.
---
Yes but most Chinese are not botters, in my book that's stereotypical racism
---
This did occur to me also.
---
At the time of asking , I had read every single comment and none referenced the original event.

Look, I don't like cheaters. More accurately, I really, really hate them. You can look through my post history if you want, I hardly even knew anything about Brisc before this. All I even knew about INIT at all was that I liked their logo and the HK thing was impressive and they seemed cool on their prop videos. But then this came out, I saw some of his more disgusting posts, learned he is a politician in real life from a generally corrupt party, and I started having some questions. Then some discord logs came out and I know some people were referring to his comments as "tame" but honestly, both that opinion and the comments themselves seem to me like pretty disgusting examples of misogyny with a big does of dogwhistling to pedophilia. And I try to remember that he's from the Southern US and their culture is a lot more accepting of pedophilia than mine, but as I write that out now, that actually just makes me feel worse about it.
---
So, I guess you're right, partially. After learning more about him I do fucking hate the guy. But I also think that based on his character, doubting his guilt of an - all things considered - pretty minor infraction of *cheating in a video game* seems a lot more like an attempt to be non-biased to the point of absurdity. Obviously he cheated, CCP would have to have literally all been simultaneously high to ban him without knowing that he cheated, and if he's even remotely like any of the pedophilic misogynistic Republicans I've had in my life, he will do practically anything to weasel his way out of it. Up to and including even *admitting* he cheated but claiming there were special circumstances. For example, he might claim he cheated "by accident" - which shouldn't matter even if it is true - it's still cheating!

There are basically 2 kinds of people in Eve. There are those who play the game. There are those who play the metagame. Stay away from the second kind of people.
---
Does your CEO know you're leaking intel to your family?
---
So what you're saying is that them completely jumping the gun, bringing down the ban hammer and publicly stating that a practicing lawyer who is legally required to self report breaches of ethics to his states barr association broke a legally binding document without having 100% concrete evidence isn't gross negligence?
---
We don't have to prove malice. They're either super incompetent or were deliberately slandering him. which is it?
---
You're candid if you think CCP does it just to be polite.
---
Yeah, I know a guy who bought like 1 bil worth of supratidal veles guns a couple months ago, its looking like a good investment
---
There's an argument that they treated him with the same rules under the EULA as anyone else, which are pretty much "we'll make the rules as we see fit and if you don't like it, at best you get your money back, get fucked". 
---
It's not fair by any stretch, but it's pretty standard for a game EULA.

A pedo based on one out of context line that was said in jest, referencing the similar US cultural norm to pierce ears at a certain age? I share a discord with the dude. His tastes are very specifically 30s to 40s thick, curvy women particularly in the backside. That was literally the only comment in 3 years of knowing the guy that has ever referenced anything below 30 and again, it was said in a long line of conversation as societal norms and was said very specifically in jest. You can say a lot about someone, accurately, after talking to them almost daily for 3 years. The dude ain't a pedo. To insinuate that from a one off joke about societal norms is indeed biased, offensive and leads one to believe that you WANT to believe it because you don't like him based on: politician, Republican, et al. You can dislike him all you want based on your own cultural background, political bent, or whatever- but cut the bullshit about dogwhistling pedophilia.

Haha, very interesting analogy, however, I think not 100%. The difference, in my opinion, is that botting is really bad but matches and lighters are not. And rmt is not as bad as burglary and rape.
---
About the botting and rmt issue, botting is the real problem and too unfair for us normal ones. Although rmt really stimulates botting for providing a way of cashing out, rmt itself is not as bad as we think.What's the difference between rmt and Plex box in the view of credit card fighters? 
---
The idea of official rmt market originates from Netease, a huge IT company of China and the new operator of Eve SQ. He created an official rmt market in one of his game which is as old as WOW and Eve. This market helps increase the supply and decrease the price of virtual items, really hurts the profit of gold farmers. It also lower the threshold of the new players. Of course, it increases the profit of Netease himself so he can hire more GM to deal with the real problem, such as botting and unofficial rmt.

Be careful, first iteration of this from CCP will just remove your ship entirely. 3 months later the logs show nothing.
---
Nobody likes AFK ratting. People might like being able to print ISK with little effort, but that's not the same thing (and, if available to everyone, just devalues ISK across all activities anyway).
---
The simplest change is to make anomalies target drones sensibly so you can't AFK them. That alone would nix most AFK play and most bots (which, as I understand it, are playing drone boat anomalies too).
---
Then you can make the spawn variable and dynamic, add rats which will burn out to you or warp to you and scram/point you to add risk, change where the spawn in point for rats is, give them some long range weapons and make them pilot more realistically.
---
You can also make NPCs not give bounties in nullsec, but instead drop tags which have to be sold like blue loot. That means if your bot (or risk-averse player) warps out at the first sign of trouble, at least you can go kill their MTU and make some money off them, and it adds another stage to the bot program's requirements.
---
Finally I don't know how bots plug into Eve but if it's through the client then CCP can change how that interaction is possible in small but annoying ways each release which would break the bot every time until the author released a patch. That means bots would have to be actively maintained to keep working.
---
I'm too lazy to use imagination for raging autists, become relevant for leaking CSM or being the first person to get their bots banned and then I'll think about it
---
flush the toilet before taking the picture, would be my first step.

---
You're right, I don't know him, and I don't share a discord with him. I don't want to, but - I admit! - that's besides the point. If you have additional logs that somehow contextualize what *seem* like misogynistic and vaguely pedophilic comments as not misogynistic or vaguely pedophilic, I *am* interested in seeing them. And I recognize context that does that is *possible*, even if it seems unlikely to me. Please understand though, that *without* the context that you, correctly, point out is missing, I can't possibly assume that the comment is a one-off or in any way unusual, (particularly given *every other high profile thing he's said* - taint licking, for example) nor does making an awful comment only once justify it.

I admit that my life experience has predisposed me towards an anti-Republican, anti-misogynist, anti-pedophilic bias when it comes to believing them innocent of something they are accused. I also admit that I pre-associate those three traits in ways that may be unfair, and just because traits are often linked together, that doesn't mean they're *always* linked. Although my life experience has given me painfully few examples where they are not, *maybe* I'm wrong this time.

I still find it hard to believe that he's innocent of cheating. Maybe I'm wrong and maybe the next Dev update will change my mind. However, I find it a lot easier to believe, if he is *anything* like I think he is based on his own comments, he will manage to weasel out of consequences. Weaseling out of consequences is the common thread between all of the things that I believe him, based on his comments and public persona, to be. Maybe I am wrong, but if he did cheat, and does weasel out of it I'm *still* going to be disappointed, like I said originally.

Maybe he wanted to ride his bike.

I'm not one to judge ppl for not logging on.

You have this completely backwards.

Wow, i did not even know those thing existed... how can you get a super alt within a day?... how many skill injectors does it need? This is crazy.

You're gonna shit your pants when you see the size of Daenerys' dick.

That's the difference between third-partying and being blue.

Goons and Legacy can hunt each other down all day and nobody cares. If they attend to a coordinated fight against others they don't shoot each other. Well... not on purpose.

Believe it or not,some VPN makers are in jail right now. :)
---
Luckily, there is still no law against the users, especially, game users. The authority is afraid of VPN, because they think tweet started the Arab Spring. The Chinese Internet censorship is far beyond you think.

You don't poop revenants into that toilet. That's what.

Context?

dont forget the R6

Traversal means nothing really, it is totally range dependent.  The only way to keep traversal up is to be closer.  All you "traversal" nerds need to retake trigonometry.  I would suggest you look at how many degrees/radians per second you are changing your angle from the target (which is what people mistakenly call traversal).
---
And...  Missile damage is affected by ship velocity, not traversal velocity.

First, it sends all your assets to Jita so that your isk can be doubled.

There so much, so well done on there.

I especially enjoy the pot of gold on the irish flag, at the end of the Dark Side of the Moon

EVE will never feel the same as 2010-2012 nor should it.
---
Purely looking at online numbers will depends on how many members PIBC have on Serenity and how many are willing to follow to TQ.
---
The timezone difference will also be quite drastic. I don't remember fighting across timezones ever being fun, only when two timezones overlap.
---
That's a pretty rational statement I can work with.  If someone is guilty and there is evidence to prove it, then they are guilty. And the opposite holds true. That's my main directive. The community was very quick to "out swords and lynching rope!" And that's from a community said to be friendly.

yes, because anchoring structures is supposed to punish wardeccers
---
Yes, drugs, porns, prostitutes, gambling and so on. Moral laws, you know.
---
Smuggling is bad but international trade with tariff is not.
---
Runescape. Same thing.
---
At least three.

Add WHer killing all of them

While certainly possible for this to be done, you may find that there's a little tiny bit of exaggeration and hyperbole on r/eve.

Better bring your translator next time when thinking for a cool name
