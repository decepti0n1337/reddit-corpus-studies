Will see you around 6nj8 then.

---
I gather this stuff just to have as much carbon as possible.
---
We're all missing the real issue.
---

---
Structure mutaplasmids when?
---
I believe he said he would leave ccp if alliance tournament wont return. I dont think anything related to the at got announced at eve vegas.
---
&gt;Ever heard of "alts"? Laughs in Fredrick Vonhole
---
That was one of the arguments used to protect links. It's always everybody else that should compensate for imbalances.
---
&gt;And just because you have a problem with an existing game mechanic does this mean it has to change? It's not a case of being better here, just the dumb weeding itself out.
---
No. It should change because it has no risk and no consequences and "counterplay" basically consists of avoidance or not playing.
---
&gt;Like I said before, don't do PVE activities in gank central, there's not really a counter play to gatecamping either but nobody is bitching about that.
---
Is that really how you want to balance the game? Avoid the issue? Fixing gates would change the entire game. It should be done but is unrealistic.
---
&gt;Speaking of, there's alot of playstyles that have no effective counter, let's take a look at cloaky camping, pipe bombing, intelligence operations, wormhole rolling, titan blobbing, bricktanking orca's, cloakysniping T3's, Excavator booshing, nullified travelceptors, citadel spam and miner bumping.
---
They are not playstyles, but many of those have been bitched about.
---
&gt;The general consensus in EVE is don't be an idiot and you won't die, you can already be as safe as you can be with the right preparations, don't make the game more fucking safe.
---
The general consensus amongst the abusers is "I want what is good for me even if it kills the game". We saw this clearly regarding wardecs.
---
&gt;It was chosen, he chose to do an abyssal pocket in a very dangerous region of space,
---
He was in high sec.
---
&gt;now exactly what is the link with this that it has to do with suicide ganking? 
---
One argument was "not broken, just bring your own". The idea is other players should compensate for imbalances so the abuse can continue.
---
&gt;Does the abyssal runner deserve to do PVE risk free in a pvp oriented game?
---
The abyss is supposed to provide the risk. It may not be enough, but that's a different discussion and has nothing to do with zero risk no consequences ganking. Both can be imbalanced.
---
&gt;You're the one bringing in OGB links as an argument which was a total afk mechanic whereas ganking is not an AFK mechanic
---
It was also pretty much zero risk and no consequences. And again, people wanted other players to compensate. This is the same argument you use here.
---
&gt;I'm not blaming anyone other than the situation that was chosen to be
---
Did he KNOW this was going to happen? This argument is just unfalsifiable bullshit. It can never be disproven.
---
&gt;He's not, have you tried flying a ship around in highsec with negative security standing? 
---
He is a known criminal yet protected by concord because of tags. There needs to be different sec status depending on area.
---
&gt;I never said balance "is so good", but I'm very much against making the game more safe,
---
You assume if you get an advantage that's always because you were better and never because balance was shit.
---
&gt;they should just delete highsec so players like you are nonexistant in this game
---
Fine, I'm not in high sec, but it would kill the game. Always the same from you people.
---
Jeez, welcome to Eve. Why should I care about someone's space? Its not mine.
---
Unfortunately, that'll get blown away by the burner NPC.
---
First of all, your web / prop combination isn't good enough to hold him down. The burner orbits around 15km from you at over 4000 m/s. That's outside the overheated range of a T2 web, and you are unlikely to be able to slingshot him with only a T2 afterburner. Also hes going to web you right back, making it even harder
---
Secondly, your tank is paper thin. Burner NPCs can strain even tanks specifically tuned to their damage type, this simply isn't going to cut it, you need an EM hardener on there as a minimum. Looking at your screenshot, you may be unaware that the assault damage control only boosts your resistances for \~15 seconds then takes over 2 minutes to cooldown before it can be used again.
---
Your damage output is OK, but your never going to be in range to apply it, and the Succubus will make mincemeat of your tank after the ADCU finished cycling.
---
As for recommendations:
---
\- Look into the Daredevil with a faction web. This is pretty much the only way you can get on top of the succubus with a brawler. A faction web can catch it at its orbit range with heat, and the daredevil gets a bonus which boosts allows the web to drop the opponent's speed by 90% (with max skills), allowing you to catch up.
---
\- Alternatively you can look at a ship which can hit out to that range. 
---
\- Here are the stats of the burner succubus, for theorycrafting purposes:
---

---
Suicide ganking. Can be done practically against any ship in high sec.
---
You use few cheap ships (like ammo) and just kill your target before concord reacts. Loot with alt.
---
This way the target loses expensive ship/cargo to bunch of destroyers that total under the value of the target.
---
Great! Still as dangerous, but a bit more easy living with citadels. I live it here!
---
Vegas is amazing. I would recommend going.
---
If it's lowsec why would they Wardec you?
---
You don't clear with the astero. Kill overseer in last room first, bookmark wreck - wait 3 minutes for the site to despawn, and warp back to your loot.
---
Edit: its clearly used here from the relative lack of wrecks on grid.
---
Maybe I just started by saying there are sites with that many cans, maybe I'm shitposting, I dunno, I'm dealing with having left my dead-end corp after trying really hard to help them out, sorry.
---
No problem, I understand.  And I didn't know about the 40-can site in shattered holes, that's a nice lead to know about.
---
I want to stress that as we ramped into Vegas we had a growing voice outright accusing CCP of _lieing_. If you tried to discuss an idea, they would shut down the idea with the only argument about how CCP is bad so they won't do it right. 
---
This is not valuable. This is what _I_ am against.

We didn't play test this at all?

Thx! Super helpful

"Speed" is a different term for "rate". A property that tells how often something happens within a given time frame.
---
The English word "fast" indicates that comparatively much is happening within a given time frame. In this case, many units of distance are traversed.
---
A craft can be fast, covering many units of distance in little time. A craft can have a high speed. A craft with a fast speed covers distance over time, over time.
---
"Fast speed" is therefore either high acceleration or retarded redundant colloquialism parroted by people who don't give two shits how retarded they sound doing so.
---
And given how OP decided to reproduce such exact numbers within "casual speech", I'd go with the latter.
---
finishing a site doesn't force one in another system to spawn immediately.  it's been tested.  you scan for the good stuff, take it, and move on to the next.  the site will despawn eventually after the first can is opened.  it also slows down other people on the route, leaving more for you.  get salty all you want about other people leaving the crap for you in sites, but this is the optimal way.

For the Serpentis Agent, the Daredevil is almost a necessity because of the web bonus. You can also use a nos + cap battery with the Daredevil so you don't need to waste ISK on cap boosters. Also a pro-tip for the Sansha Burner is to wait 5 seconds upon landing, then start locking it up. This is because it will start trying to kite you as soon as you do something, where as if you wait 5 seconds it will pass you at around 6km so you can avoid the chase.

I do have a quick guide, but the fit is quite blingy as it is designed for running multiple burners in a system before docking:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvchFN1UC9U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvchFN1UC9U)

Red frog is a name I remember I'll have a look thanks

Could be some other color of frog btw. Dont really use them in highsec but you should find em googling

My coworkers, colleagues, and crewmates are in general way cooler than I could ever hope to be.

I’m just the schlub they put on camera for chuckles.

Are you not entertained?!

Yes. This is because time and space are part of the same thing called "Spacetime".

imo as a newby a very reliable isk income stream is just battleship ratting anomalies in nullsec, this can also be done on alphas, also the skills you train translate well to pvp. Plus it saves you a lot of hassle that is involved with mining as you get liquid isk printed from bounties straight into your wallet. 
---
The praxis is probably the best ship to get as it has low skill requirements and good hull bonusses for alpha. It is very slow but that is  exactly what doesnt matter for nullsec anoms.
---
If you keep an eye on local you have plenty of time to get to safety. 
---
It wont make you those big 'pops' on sites you get from all the explo stuff, but it's a steady flow, which is much less demotivating than instantly losing a lot of stuff. 
---
Eventually you probably want to _buy_ a subscription if you can and consider carriers. imo.
---
Sell it hopefully, buy many many kikis...
---
I see a lot of people recommending null ratting, but its very mind numbingly boring. Entire gameplay of that consists of pressing 2-3 buttons every so often, As a new player that will make you hate the game.
---
Easiest way to make money as newbie is doing exploration. When I was new I found out that doing nullsec exploration would yield me around 150-200 mil per run and it was really good source of isk. Use [eve-scout](http://www.eve-scout.com/) to find Thera connection, Thera is a weird wormhole that always has connection to 3 highsec, 3 lowsec and 3 nullsec systems, so you can go inside from highsec and then extract back safely. Once you get the ropes of wormholes and scanning you can just use any wormhole you find in null as there's quite high chance it will lead you back to highsec for safe extraction.
---
Also, some people like to camp the data/relic sites in null. Usual symptoms of a camper are
---
* one single data/relic(usually relic) site in system
---
* one guy in local chat
---
you can use [zkill](https://zkillboard.com/) to find out about their activity and easily guess if they're camper or not.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
once you get the hang of it, exploration is really nice way to make a lot of money with very little investment.
---
and one last thing, Dronelands(which I think is entire east of map from Insmother to Oasa) works differently and doesn't have relic sites. Data sites it has are very sparse and can have completely empty lootcans. Not worth it
---
Not really when u start . Just explore Wormholes c1-c3 . Did that @ the beginning and u can make 100 Millions in some hours . Sometimes u get 2-3 hours nothing and than u find a hole with good relict/Date thing .
---
Afzer that u can buy sister core and of course CLOAK . Thats chill with

Warp drives are meant to be (theoretical) FTL means of travel. While your ship is traveling at sub-light speeds, space itself is moved across the ship which makes it travel FTL.
---
:(
---
As much as I would like to move those too, they’ve only mentioned jump gates since they suggested it. I don’t see why one would assume more than that.
---
So it’s not really worth going alone?
---
it counts - faster you scan more sites you can run - more money. kinda simple really
---
This was the biggest eve related surprise in the past couple years for me. It's a damn good promo, not on par with "this is eve" but it's pretty high as far as trailers go. And we're finally done with the streamer nonsense. Well done CCP!
---
the thing is that 3 million is nothing for me when i get 10 times that from 1 site
---
i also never really lose them
---
Who are you talking to? 
---
Since about 99% of your posts are 3 word shitposts, just fuck off and do some research before calling people a FRAT bot. 
---
And in case that was aimed at the general idea of FRAT, then why the fuck did u post it as a response to my post...
---
That's happened to me too it seems a 10ish second despawn timer starts after you activate each can at least once. So if you fail your last can once the site will despawn from the probe window as you're doing your second hack on it.
---
It's still safer to blow it up tho so you don't have to keep track of which ones you've already scanned.
---
EvE is all about grinding, so the only way to "break the loop" that you are in is to quit...

Thank you, but is it mainly pvp related?

Internet slang for "That feel/feeling when..." or "That face when..."

That sounds extremely out of line from my own experiences.  2-5 per site has been pretty consistent in my time doing explo.

ok mate, i'll take your word on it. you definitely came off as upset though originally, maybe that's just me. that's why i suggested what i did

I just came back to eve from a long hiatus, can someone explain like i'm a newbro?

I'm more looking to learn everything I can before I leave, lol. Not looking to actually "matter" and be someone important, not yet. Just want to fill my wallet, learn all I can and have fun for now.

Some of us like the workings of a bloc compared to small groups, and I figure we should have both of those at all times.

Must be. 50M+ cans are not very common, 150M+ even less so, but 5-15M? One or two in almost every site. 2M\\site are highsec numbers, not J-space.
---
I did highsec sites just to compare; those are usually 20-50k/site.
---
Where in the everliving fuck are you pulling these numbers from?

PI alts will basically never do combat stuff so the magic 14 is not useful for them. Generally people use them for research/reactions/manufacturing slots with minimal ability to actually fly spaceships.

It will die shortly after anchored and filled with reactions. A tatara can die to a few ships with logi or a single dread.

Oh no, its retarded.png

Seriously, I have no idea what people are claiming.  Any time I do explo I'm getting 2m/site max from all six cans.
---
&gt; To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand mining. The appeal is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the nuances will go over a typical Eve player's head.

Been to Fanfest myself - honestly, EVE was not really the main thing people talked about outside the panels and roundtables. There is always a lot more fun to be had :)

Smaller groups will war dec to avoid attention and avoid suspect timers. Saw this happen a couple times.

I suspect it wasn't "intended" to be a material sink. It very well could be, and duals still will be. However, I somehow doubt CCP started out with the idea that they needed a new material sink in the game.

I am not strictly speaking advocating for this feature as described, but I disagree with your assertion.
