I think you'd get smashed.

Init certainly are using Fountain much better than we ever did. There is glorious peace right across Fountain under init's sewardship, no meddling young alliances trying to carve up the regions far flung constellations. No fighting for dominence of the 'desireable' moons, I assume even Fcore are dead ? A true utopia, and the rent is cheaper to boot.

One of those things you just have to go for it on.

In that case I'd suggest waiting till you're on your pc and can see things very clearly before commenting. In the future that will help you avoid embarrassing yourself.

Welcome to Snuff

I don't get it.  Looks like an ex-wife to me.
---
Maybe

So I have no idea what it has to do with test celebration but if you don’t know about the unique way trig alpha works you’ve definitely missed an occasion to get smarter. Since you only have one gun a wrecking shot will always deal 300% of your base damage contrary to all other weapons that require multiple guns and thus have a negligible chance of a full wrecking shot. 1% of the time (remember that you have high rof) your gun will do triple damage meaning that for the case of a ramped leshak something that has less than 25ehp main buffer remaining will just suddenly disappear. Be it under reps or not. Even a drek with meson will volley harder than an arti cane at 40km with minimal warm up. 
---
For the competing with long range guns part. The other guy responding gives the example of the bni which is obviously at the top of the long range bcs together with the ferox. But if you look outside of the very top at say a cane fleet issue the base damage of the cane fleet with 720s is literally the same as the starting damage of a drek. That’s why I’m saying competes and not beats. Trig guns are definitely still strong in the 30-70km range. And combined with their tracking and the speed, tank and utility of the ship itself a better choice for fighting at that range provided you’re not trying to trade. 
---
Now for the ramp up. Once again if you look at the top like the vindi yes it is true that you need 30s to get to vindi level and one min to do same overtime damage. But if you look a bit under the top dps pirate battleships which trig weapons overcome eventually anyway and compare to similar ranged weapons like pulse crystals on a napoc or apoc the leshak does literally the same damage at the start as they do at all. 
---
But sure everything is fine. I too love pawning noobs in my leshak and my drek but the day every idiot and his mum will undock in trig ships as soon as someone shows up the game is gonna be dull outside of fleet fights. And one of the main reasons is the lack of rock/paper scissors mechanics of the trig guns that have no real weakness. Obviously a lot is also due to the ships themselves with the speed and tank creep they introduce in the game that will patch most of the potential weaknesses.
---
You call them bugs; I called them tricks.  Don't spin my words and welcome to HS.
---
Yeah because they've driven off so many pvp focused players who had 1-4 accounts and are thus increasingly dependent on people using plex for vni rorq and skill farming armies to keep their subs up. They nuke the hundreds if not thousands of accounts being plexed by botters and isoboxxers and their income plummets. And half of the money from selling is tied to income goals.
---
rofl
---
No they did not. But mar5hy did
---
And your inexperience would have left you wondering why offensive fax entosis didn't work against t2 linked 200km rapiers
---
That neck though...
---
It's still funny to me that you think you're the only person in the game who's run 200km Rapiers when you had access to our wiki.

TIL rapid, fatigueless power projection is a QOL issue

Welcome to SkillUrself 
---
I agree. A proper Goon is a useful krab, not a useless krab.
---
Subcaps are fun?
---
I'll go over it as some of the guys here aren't replying helpfully.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm using [http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/A-YB15](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/A-YB15) as an example here. If you look at the ADM weekly graph. the bit where it drops to 0 is when your Ihub was destroyed. A new one needs to be dropped at 3 bill a pop each time its destroyed. 
---
If you look across The Kalevala Expanse the alot of your ihubs have been destroyed and PH has been forced to replace em each time.
---
Destroying an ihub is a big deal. The space it supports becomes useless to Ratters and Miners as the upgrades needed to get the Mining and Ratting Anoms are part of the ihub and die with it. All Infastructure like Cyno Beacons, Ansiblex jump gates and Cyno jammers needs  ADM of 3 or higher and that resets each time its killed. 
---
The rest of the systems are being camped until they are naturally loosing their ADM's with only a few being secured. This means that Renter alliances that used to live there are bailing and moving to newer safer areas. So PH is paying for the IHubs, loosing money from renters and cant secure The Expanse, then telling its line members everything is fine, when it isnt.
---
Wrong burst scripts btw
---
To be fair to CCP, it's both the way they've always done it and it's an easy statement to plug into a SQL procedure. I'm just a salty bittervet.

This thread tl;dr

We stole the rapiers from CO2 afaik. We stole beartrap ferox from horde. Prophecy/drake bricks from PL. I never claimed to have been the only person in the game to use these tools, we sure as shit were the most potent 15 dudes in the game at using them.
---
Yes, it means precisely that, which is irrelevant. 
---
What gamerword??

---
Is double think just universal now?
---
1. There's probably almost no rorqs input broadcasting. Go test your apm mashing 2 keys
---
2. The only person proven to be input broadcasting is fine because ~reasons~.
---
You know as well as I do that if there's a timer 30 jumps away, we're going there 60 jumps (round trip) or not.
---
Also, keeping that shit fueled for a battleship fleet is not trivial, let alone a cap fleet.  We still just jump our caps to cynos.
---
So unless you're talking about some theoretical use of jump gates that I haven't seen yet, I'm not sure how they change power projection except that it's not nearly as AIDs as it was.
---
Only one rock haven in system, eh? 
---
So you come from the Doomchinchilla school of how shit TEST is?
---
From the arse end, or did he dribble out of Odin's dick?

But why both 'rapid deployment'?

Its amusing that in your head, in spite of a total shut out and failure in your providence campaign, you are still dreaming up scenarios where you totally would have won if only if.
---
Its like getting antagonized in an interpersonal conflict, walking out, and then thinking of the perfect comeback 9 months later.
---
Do you understand anything of what Farmstink and myself are discussing?
---
I'll take "Things that Never Happened" for $800, Alex.

Because for some reason they think it is more important than fixing the mechanics that make it not only possible, but appealing to the average krab.

true galaxybrain game company forces people to live with parts of the game broken for so long that the players no longer have the will to report the bugs anymore

Adding one extra character would give millions of possibilities this removing the need for exhuming old corp names. IMO a better option. Like adding the 7 to mobile phones in the UK.

Still funny.

Yeah, I disagree with the OP on this issue (As I remember Jump Bridges pre Jump Fatigue so ansiblex with no Fatigue is like going back to early Eve for me.) but I have no fucking notion what you are on about here.
---
He's arguing for a nerf to Ansiblex gates as they make the game easier for large coalitions, like his.
---
You are trying to insinuate he wants more gates in regions he doesnt own. Which he never said and hasnt mentioned in any of his replies. 
---
His complaint is not with Where the Gates are but the Gates themselves.
---
Go back, read through his answers slowly and try again.
---
lol dude he's just explaining why we lost, because we did lose and that's that. the reason people used 200km rapiers is cos they were really good, and triage entosis was shit before the change. he's not saying the change is *why* we lost, just that triage entosis was awful (hint: we were sometimes forced to use it before the changes and it fucking sucked).  
---
whether before or after the change, if you can put fax on nodes and the other side cannot out-escalate (or at least match) you, you win. the decision was made not to bring the supers south, legacy made the decision to bring their supers to provi, so they won.
---
Dont confuse him with facts it can be distracting for him.
---
I looked at this photo and my first thought wasn't "oh wow, titans", it was "how the fuck does this guy have such a clean screen? Where are all the windows?"

They make it significantly easier to defend your space by reducing the time it takes for you to move around. If you don't think that's a major advantage I don't know what to tell you, friend.
---
Fake asf, but a good meme nonetheless, have an upvote
---
This is like saying animal rights are less important than human rights so we shouldn't care about it.

Also, CCP will never change mechanics forcing people into 20 accounts so maybe pushing them to enforce their rules is a better approach with potential result.

Dude, this while thread is about how skill u is using them to attack Razor.

If you don't think that's a major advantage, I don't know what to tell you either.
---
Our providence campaign was pretty successful, we removed every single i-hub in provi, and by we I mean PL because it was in no way all P3AK. We farmed the shit out of the provi bloc alliances over a three month period it was glorious.
---
It was ofc inevitable that, once all of Legacy came with their supers, the stations would fall. Which is why I said PL didn't 'drop the ball', there was nothing that could have been done to prevent that. 
---
Don't mistaken me jousting with Farmstink over who actually knows there shit, with imagining my 15 man gang could have beaten legacy.
---
Tackling a rorqual or reinforcing a jump bridge are probably the best ways for a small group.

Gee,
---
Lucky when I resumed in June I was not effected by the chat bug. Fkn dodged the bullet there...
---
Meh tbh I don't really care if people use mouse/keyboard macros, script, input broadcast, literally has zero effect on my game play. I don't care if someone makes 1T/hr tbh. I don't care if people bot, I don't care if people RMT. It literally has zero impact on my game, or the game as a whole really. Ive played a lot of MMOs and botting/RMTing is such a trivial impact in them in every case. Shit in many cases it improves the quality of gameplay as people bot to mitigate mundane tasks which are typically necessities for base economy in games.    
---
I only said something because I hate bullshit, and bud was talking bullshit.

Yeah I'm kinda peeved as I started just after this :/
---
At this point I have no sympathy for these players that get caught by snuff in these 'traps'. This is how snuff likes to play the game, which is fine to each their own. But at this point with their reputation and how easy it would be to send an alt over to check what/where the cyno is you have to be pretty dumb to get caught. I guess I'm actually impressed by snuff's ability to find these people
---
Yes and there are no ways to attack anything on grid with a Keepstar or Fortizar. Thats why no Keep or Fort has died ingame and why no Ships have died on a Fort or Keep grid ever. /s
---
Seriously, the old Jump Bridges Required a medium sized Sub Cap fleet or Caps to tackle a DickStar or Death Star. A similar sized fleet can easily knock over an Ansiblex, its already happened.
---
In the last 30 days there have been 24 Ansiblex's killed. [https://zkillboard.com/ship/35841/](https://zkillboard.com/ship/35841/)
---
And as with all Upwell structure including Citadels the Timer is always set by the owner it will always be a time of their choosing. The attack at a weird time to get a better time for your alliance trick hasnt been a thing for a while now.
---
they don't even do remotely close to the same things
---
I think the rules were kind of "Don't be a dick about it" IIRC.
---
Afterschool time. He was crabbing for over a year for it. 
---
Is input broadcasting good? 
---
I do think it's a major advantage. I didn't say it was only an advantage for you - there's no need to get defensive. You're the one arguing that making the things you want to do easier isn't advantageous. 
---
The fact that skill u can simultaneously hold space all over the eastern half of the map while TEST defends its buffer zone comfortably from U-Q should tell you something is wrong here. Ansiblexes have shrunk the game drastically.
---
What? That simile makes no sense whatsoever. No one is forced into 20 accounts, there are plenty of people who do inactive extremely easy, very safe pve activities with a low number of accounts. The fact that it is easily scalable is simply the result of that.
---
Delayed local (until gate decloak), means you get to load grid. 
---
Like often times you're in local before you fully loaded grid like that's far from optimal. 
---
Now, gate decloak would mean you get to d-scan for free and hit warp it still gives seconds for the ratter to react.
---
Well you have the community manager telling you to use a support ticket. I'd do that. It's entirely possible that maybe the GM was new, got confused, misread something, had a brain fart, maybe a process was broken for a bit - who knows. But today he's saying support ticket so that's the route you should take when you see this stuff, for sure.
---
quick everyone go buy rmt isk from russians before they cant connect anymore 
---
I personally have loved chat being broke... meant null you could actually catch stuff.
---
Why people think they need SP ... when everyone uses teamspeak / slack / discord.
---
Oh no I could not see jita spam... my heart breaks.
---
Burn all input broadcasters and bots
---
Limited hyperspatpials in low is giving me level 5 autism
---
We do awox them from time to time. I don't think leadership of any alliance wants to start a wide scale internal witch hunt on their own guys though - even if it gets every bot the drama, headaches and misfires alone would be a nightmare. Especially for an issue that ought to be dealt with by CCP.
---
 If you just count the single Ansiblex as the only cost then sure.
---
If you are actually doing it correctly  then its much more expensive.
---
Its actually  2,440,271,075.56 ISK as you need 2 Ansiblex gates.
---
You need (According to r/eve anyway) Either a Fort or a keep per gate too. So thats either  18,691,799,980 ISK for 2 Forts or God knows for 2 Keeps (No evepraisal for them.)  Dont forget fittings for both, Fuel for both, Fleet ops to online and anchor both.
---
Plus 2 Ihubs with the needed upgrades, Sov 3 to online them (I believe its no higher than 3 but Im not 100%), LO to fuel em and people to defend them.
---
But yeah only  1,220,135,537.78 ISK sure.
---
This comment doesn't even make sense. Why would that matter.  
---
This vid does show something. It shows a guy with 12 Rorqs taking about 6 seconds to recall all his drones. Which is pretty fucking reasonable if you have a hotkey and EVE-O Preview. 
---
i get that thrown on me all the time -_-
---
I don't think anyone was asserting that there are no bots in goons. Your post makes little sense because there is a good input / broadcasting thread on the front page right now... that you've posted in.
---
12 Accounts...6 seconds between first and last drone leaving grid (in groups).   
---
Half a second per Hotkey Press.  
---
Looks like EVE-O preview to me. 
---
You a dumb dumb
---
Boting in a video game is not a crime though. It’s your right to not give a shit and go do other stuff and have fun. If you care about the general state of the game and ccp was actually doing shit against it then it would reasonably make sense to report them, not because of some legal or moral obligation but because you care. But not caring is also totally fine. People should really stop witch-hunting actual players for “complicity” because they choose to care about other things and not waste their time on hunting/kicking/reporting bots.
---
Just buy a screwed up mic. 
---
I dont know who this is.
---
Correct. If you're skirting the timers really close, then there are two additional factors that can come into play.
---
1) The 12 or 24 hour distance to set hour/day happens *before* the +/- 2 hour roll. So it is possible to get a timer as soon as 10 hours away.
---
2) The 12 or 24 hour distance is measured from either when you start the bash or when you end it. I'm *pretty sure* it's from when you end it, but not 100% sure.
---
I do miss the entosis Rapiers. Slingshotting Griffins at your Rapiers was the most fun I've had in a long time.
---
There
---
I mean it is definitely CCP's responsibility but I'd be 99.99% certain that this guy input broadcasted. The .001% doubt is only from the extremely off chance that maybe the server sputtered or something weird with his OS / Client / connection caused the recall commands to queue + send all at once. I can't think of a single way this would happen but, well, maybe.

---
&gt;We farmed the shit out of the provi bloc alliances over a three month period, it was glorious.
---
Not really. The first 3-4 weeks we tried to fight you head on, but you chose to overwhelmingly obliterate every fleet we formed, which was boring as hell for us. So we stopped doing that. The remaining 2 months were all claw and jackdaw fleets, where the priority was denying you content. Which we did pretty well, I'd argue. We lost relatively little after that, save for some troll entosis Griffins.
---
I'm not complaining about that tactic, FYI. Just saying. You could have had a lot more content had you just chilled a bit :)
---
The issue is more that the likely reason for saying this is to appeal to the botters. 
---
It's not that different from why Tishu often get's linked to nazism. 
---
Consider Phlebas and Matter are definitely up there too
---
It could also be multiple people in the same Corp recalling their drones after somebody on comms said something. Or maybe he has his kids mining for him. Obviously input broadcasting is the most likely answer but if it isn't blatantly obvious like botting I don't think alliances culpable unless the pilot is bragging openly about it.
---
This. I like flying logi and it's really fucking annoying to have a swarm of ECM drones or sensor damps on me. It pretty much takes me out of the fight half the time
---
O7
---
This is not exclusive to wspace, see the legacy response to skill u raitarus on their borders
---
I'm saying that if it's an advantage for everyone, it's an advantage for no one.
---
I don't think anything is wrong. Being able to get to a fight in a reasonable time in our space is great.  Since when is being able to get to more fights a bad thing?
---
You are aware only 1 can be deployed per system?
---
This isnt like the cyno Jammers where you can have 2 offline somewhere in system and flick em on.
---
If you loose a Ansiblex a new one needs to be anchored first, then onlined, then connected to the next gate.
---
Include the 10 min High power damage cap (2.5 mins at damage cap with no reinforced mode for low power) and its an easy target.
---
&gt; the “not my job” narrative.
---
I don't really agree with the guy you're replying to but for the sake of fairness it is a bit more than just 'narrative'. It does make sense from a leadership perspective to not want to start an internal witch hunt on your line members. That is a pretty fair opinion to have. 
---
It is quietly dealt with from time to time (and possibly more than I've cared to look into). There's no massive effort AFAIK to end all bots but I do see them occasionally get awox'd and I've shot a few myself. One of the bots I personally watched die and subsequently get kicked was met with ridicule on reddit  "OH LOOK GOONS TRYING TO ACT LIKE THEY DO SOMETHING ABOUT BOTS". Maybe, just maybe, the problem is a bit bigger than just GSF? Sure, we could probably do more. But it comes at a cost outside of just lost ratting income tax - if you get shit on for doing what everyone is shitting on you for not doing... why take the risk at all when it's also not your problem?

CCP are fucking shit at managing chat but they have enough common sense to not ban someone (lose profit) over what was probably an accident (which didn't actually affect anyone anyway).
---
you say you use eve-o preview right ? Setup little window, setup the keybind and you just click trough all the window without even having to think, just click at the right place at the right time, and you say you are slower than this guy with 4 rorq and the same setup ? wow

---
But you knew that chat is broken when you came back, we saw the switch from working to not working.
---
Wormholers already did it.
---
But it isn't an advantage for everyone. It's disproportionately advantageous for people like Legacy and Skill U, and not so for smaller groups. 
---
Getting more fights is good, but only part of the equation. I'd rather seen more groups involved rather than the same 2-3 nullsec megacoalitions dipping their toes in every conflict in the game because they are bored.
---
Remember when no one wanted to use supers because PL would show up within 30 minutes from across the galaxy? We're quickly getting there, but instead of a super fleet, it's a couple hundred dudes in subcaps. Shrinking space by making travel across it trivial means that larger alliances can owns huge amounts of space they do not actually use. You like it because it benefits you, and you don't seem to understand that everyone who isn't in a major sov-holding NS alliance, or has bent the knee to one, thinks it's eye-rollingly broken.

not even that high of APM. The last drone that leaves field leaves at 8s. That is a key press every .75s. That isn't that insane. Slow it down to .25 and watch the drones leave in clusters roughly 1s apart.

Buffer for more reaction time, kinda important for new players when they start taking a bunch of damage, also, as new players they don't have all their skills yet, so less speed, less resists of off any resist mods, they take more damage cause everything shoots them for longer periods of time cause less DPS, etc. Its actually pretty important.
---
That's hot!
---
One is warping in to blap a hauler, and the other is sitting on rocks. One you know is about to happen, and the other is in sudden response to local - a reaction to something unexpected and out of your control.

don't forget the ihub and upgrade.
---
Replace Goons with any other large entity, and you would lose your boogeyman/scapegoat. The possibility of getting dropped on by supertits didn't stop Bombers Bar from coming into Delve. I also didn't see a single bit of whining in local when our response fleet arrived in system. Come to think of it, I have never seen any whining from the singles, pairs, and small gangs up to a dozen or so. Unlike reddit. Maybe you guys aren't even playing the game, and just engaging on the only form of verbal PVP you think you might have a chance at winning...
---
Ok benefit of the doubt, maybe goons are hard trolling and 100% not Botting just doing countdowns before pulls. Hopefully there is something CCP can look at to prove it one way or another. Or add something to mining to make Botting more difficult.
---
Is it botlike ? Is it as harmful as a bot ? Then no loss.

YEah they use asic miners these days

It's good that they've got enough of the issues sorted they can continue with the new chat, tbh, even if it is a bit of a meme in these parts. 
---
you cant do this in one second. Is this like a CFC trade mark response. Some Init dude said literally the exact same thing.  
---
Only way you do this in under a second is if you have a macro key that is functioning as a press/depress action every .15 min, and you just scroll over all your shit.  
---
You ain't hitting a key yourself every .15s i can assure that. Going from standstill to 500 APM in a split second is 100% bullshit. Dont give a fuck how fast you can peak APM. You aint performing no 8 actions a second starting from zero.  
---
Whilst I think the new jb needs fattygay and/or some sort of timer. You can just RF them, don't even need to kill. Just RF before your timer or right after the exit window for said structure.
---
I can't wait for multiboxed 20-50 supers and titans PvE fleets. They will need more rats to blow up.
---
Kalevala doesn’t make 150-200b a month 
---
Your moving in the wrong direction.

---
Try the low sec gate to stain
---
Yeah. There's not a lot that's accurate there, but I can't be assed to go through it all.
---
We fight the same people, in the same places we always have. We own the same space and respond to people in our space the same way.
---
The only difference is that we don't have to form 30 minutes early to travel, and we're back 30 minutes earlier.
---
All this shit about us helicopter dicking subcap, we would have done it before.  It's just less annoying.
---
What do you care if null blocks are using gates to fight each other?
---
When have you ever been fucked over by jump gates?
---
Just because you don't like something doesn't make it bad for the game.
---
Uhh weve been at it 2 yrs, 1 reply 18 mos ago, gotta poke the right dev
---
What is broadcast inputting?
---
I have seen this sort of thing in my space a few times. When I asked the guy doing it, he simply squad warps the rorquals to a point, launches each one to the book mark which is in order on his menu like I've seen, then uses shortcuts to launch drones and so on. It's like clockwork but it's all done manually. Some of the guys down here have become extremely efficient at it. They set everything up bookmark wise with a cloaky alt before doing the squad/fleet warp thing.
---
&gt;'PL' didn't drop the ball.
---
So you are blaming P3AK then?
---
&gt;We did not have our super fleet in the south and so had no way to force multiply ourselves to withstand all of Legacy, or deal with tapi fax.
---
The Tapi Faxes in Immensea? 2 mids away minimum? That never left TAPI staging? That would have been a good excuse if there were ever any Faxes used by Legacy during that campaign.
---
not sure why u posting these . these are pretty old things and CCP barely response to these. u realise if CCP ban these 10 rorq pilot thats CCP loss. and if they bann all botters and input brodcaster  , then game will be too good 
---
&gt; Plus 2 Ihubs with the needed upgrades, Sov 3 to online them (I believe its no higher than 3 but Im not 100%), LO to fuel em and people to defend them.
---
I didnt. See the bit that mentions IHUBs and upgrades, that's the bit about IHUB's and upgrades. Sorry if that wasnt clear.
---
.4 seconds isn't long enough to press a drone recall and an alt tab button? I know there's people broadcasting out there... but what you said is retarded.
---
whups 
---
Ah the good old days when x blob could insta kill your ihub/tcu/flip station on final timer
---
Well it takes 8s for the drones to leave field, and you can see them leave in clusters roughly 1s apart.   
---
I wouldn't say its input broadcasting, but they are certainly using a keyboard/mouse macro that automates a hotkey press/depress.
---
Because it's completely impossible to bypass anticheat, especially when you don't even need to inject into the game.
---
But according to Reddit goons don't bot, hence why I get Downvoted whenever i say so   
---
:thinking:
---
actually if you slow it to .25s playback you see 8 instances of drones leaving over an 8 second period. 1s per cluster.   
---
Still on borderline of human input, id wager its a mouse/keyboard hotkey simulating a repeated press/depress of a hotkey.
---
did you contact a diplo before reporting to ccp? 
---
YES!!!
---
Its not super human speed though....it takes 8 seconds for the last drone to leave field....and if you slow the video down to .25 you can literally see 8 clusters of drones leave the field one at a time every second. 
---
The surge in 'cloaky camper' complaints will sure be neat.
---
&gt; So as the title suggest, eve doesnt really explain what weapons are good for what. Whats the difference between artillary, guns, lasers, etc... What's the difference between a pulse laser, and a non pulse laser. What's the benefit of one vs the other? 
---
You can always hit "show info" and go into attributes Tab for detailed information on a weapon, however that is a bit deceptive as putting different ammo types in it will change those attributes. Its better to fit the 2 weapons right next to each other in the fitting simulator, put ammo in them, move your mouse over them and see the difference when the tooltip comes up.
---
In general:
---
Missiles and Projectile do not use capacitors. Have all damage types ammo available to them. 
---
Hybrids and lasers use quite a lot of cap, and have much more limited ammo choices.
---
Triglavian weapons have much shorter range and a spool up time to achieve their DPS, they use a lot of cap, but they are very high if not highest DPS in their categories once spooled up.
---
Because of the capacitor use Missles and Projectile make on average much better PvE weapons, throw drones into it too. It frees up fitting space for more tank or mobility or utility. PvE fits usually need to be either more cap stable or perfectly stable vs PvP fits.
---
In medium and large battles, where things start to lag etc. Turrets in general outperform missles, many times your missles will not even hit their targets. And even if they were not lagging, there are some super fast ships and fits in the game where missles just have trouble hitting them period, and either apply a lot less DPS or miss completely. In small scale this isn't as bad, they are still fully effective vs most ships.
---
Hasn't anyone seen 'the mirrormask'
---
&gt; Crazy idea I know, but what if there was an MOTD for the TCU owners of a system added to local chat? 
---
Do you really, honestly want them to touch it ? I mean ..... Seriously. Do you want them to touch anything on the chat servers that doesn't include bringing them up to their full functionality at least ?
---
Billions of tons of ore mines daily. And none of it in the Kavala Expense.
---
There is only one legal way to input “broadcast” and that is on multiple physical machines with the same setup and a physical rack of mice connected together.  You can click all physical mice at once.  
---
Move them all at once... etc.  
---
De sync is a bitch though. 
---
"war" in the south btw.
---
Maybe this is their plan for new advertisements or something, instead of battles they will be making advert videos of 100s upon 100s of Rorquals and use that instead.
---
Ok just for you I'm gonna lay out this extremely complicated process that you can't do without input broadcasting appearently.
---
1. Bind your shortcut for "All Drones: Return to Drone Bay" to something simpler than Shift-R. Make it a 1 button press, preferably bind it to a mouse side button.
---
2. Get EvE-O Preview and set it up properly so you have a shortcut for each client. Preferebly in a row on your keyboard or something like the numpad keys. You can also rebind them to some shortcut keys like I have on my Razer Blackwidow.
---
(This can be found in the readme.pdf in your installation folder. https://i.imgur.com/YXqUoKh.png)
---
DONE
---
This is even more complicated than it should be, because you could also setup a hotkey to just scroll through the different clients instead of assigning a specific key to only 1 client.
---
If my 6 sets of excavators are in danger I press:
---
Numpad 1 -&gt; Mouse Button 6
---
Numpad 2 -&gt; Mouse Button 6
---
Numpad 3 -&gt; Mouse Button 6
---
Numpad 4 -&gt; Mouse Button 6
---
Numpad 5 -&gt; Mouse Button 6
---
Numpad 6 -&gt; Mouse Button 6
---
This is around 1 second. Maybe 1.5
---
The first time you heard 'the cap is empty' is when you activated your neut.

PLEASE NO WE ALREADY HAVE WECU
---
100% agree with this... people say null is dead.
---
I can jump into an interceptor and catch a rorq with 15minutes of leaving jita.
---
I can do the same in a sabre and catch a super... maybe even a titan depending on if they are streaming on twitch.
---
Reason I don't just kill them is because i am lazy.  
---
eBay! It works!
---
yea because everybody that does "accidentally" on regular basis do anything like that, either drones, or warping or whatever else, will come out and announce that they did so huh ? Its only "accident" and only that one time when they get caught.
---
Kalevala is a hard name, I agree. I named it Kalavela for the first two years.
---
Of course, it's currently making 0b a month, and has been for many months after they were permanently cloaky camped. Never the less, if the average rent is 2.5b per system a month, TKE hits over 170b per months.
---
You keep sweet talking like that and your going to find yourself in a snuggle next to a log fire 
---
They didn't recall drones.  The video shows OP removing them from the overview.  You can still see them in space until the end of the clip.
---
Every market sell and buy order is mirrored on to sisi on the day of the new mirror.
---
Right like i said **YOU** can't do this in one second. You are using 3rd party programs to macro the actions.  
---
And no I don't care that you do this, but at least tell it like it is instead of saying "I can do it in under a second". No **YOU** can't. Your computer is doing it under a second because you are using programs that facilitate that.   
---
Just like the guy in the video above did, whose drones leave in clear clusters roughly 1s apart over the span of 8s.   
---
Slow it to .25 and you will see exactly what I mean (see my main comment above for timestamps of when drones leave grid and their rough clock location)  
---
Manface!
---
GUYS HE REMOVED THE DRONES FROM HIS OVERVIEW THAT'S WHY THEY ALL DISAPPEARED 
---
The world needs more T-C’s.
---
To correct one thing: you could shoot and shutdown old jump bridges with like 4-5 supers (post Citadel changes) quite fast, even on heavily gunned POS, and if you did it either far out of someones timezone or when they were busy somewhere else, you'd probably not even see a response (and even if someone with correct rights showed up, gunned POS alone couldn't do anything meaningful in that time). Doing that with Ansiblex on Fortizar grid can be completely denied by one person logging one alt to arm the structure.
---
It didn't matter much in open warfare kind of fight, but was a tool to force other group into making potentially bad decisions under time pressure - can you afford having JB shutdown and have to repair it for a long time (hull reps are awful) while being at constant risk of having your logi farmed all that time, do you take whatever you can flashform and go in while at risk of being baited, do you just take the loss, form a fleet to finish off a JB and anchor new one? I've seen a lot of fun stuff (and sometimes interesting fights) happening just because of ability to shutdown key but remote jumpbridge in short time without giving two days heads up for JB owners to maxform for defense timer.
---
The thing is: for shutting down any Ansiblex on Fortizar/Keepstar grid you have to form and put on grid proper full fleet and don't have the ability to play around possible response time as a way to force decisions on the fly.

I don't doubt allot of the people that play eve would be capable of the APM required for this sort of thing.
---
I'm not using a macro https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/macro
---
Every button I press is **ONE SINGLE** action.
---
The only thing EvE-O preview does is change Alt-Tab to a specific button and is totally allowed unlike input broadcasting. I dont care if you're an Alt-Tab purist or something, but ofc I'm gonna use the tools allowed to when multiboxing this many accounts, like the guy in the video **PROBABLY** did.

---
as a software dev, I really dont understand how they could have fucked a solved solution like chat up so badly.... but if i had to speculate it has something to do with POS code.
---
&gt; if the average rent is 2.5b per system a month
---
yeah nah
---
oh thank god somebody finally fucking recorded this

fuck DSONS so much

Rorqual broadcasting is harmful
---
makes you think...how much of that fluid in the capsule is actually from you?
---
its not riski, it has ez targets with 70 excavatos in cargo
---
Brav.... every time I think about what we had.. I weep
---
TAU AUD LOVA!
---
Your biased brav!
---
Depending how you then define broadcasting to clients, policy of that kind could also effectively ban one or more of: using on-screen keyboard, using any keyboard/mouse with programmable keys in driver software, playing EVE via any kind of remote desktop software or playing EVE on virtualized environment (which technically includes any Windows with Hyper-V enabled), using any window manager, using full screen overlays or global hotkeys. And when something like that happens, having to deal with any unfair bans (that would happen in whatever the grey are would be, or just accidentally hitting innocent players) would be a headache.
---
If I set "Recall to drone bay" to G button and then in mouse driver set that pressing MB7 emits "G" keycode (effectively: broadcasts pressing "G" to active window) is that considered bannable or not?
---
Pretty sure mobile is bigger in the West too.

It's not about the name or alliance of who gets caught. It's about the activity.
---
A miner uses broadcasting for mining. Broadcasting for mining is illegal and harmful. If he gets caught nobody should buy the accident alibi.
---
A camper uses broadcasting for logging in. Broadcasting logins is allowed and not harmful. If he gets caught it is safe to believe it was an accident.

&gt;	banned from goons
---
And nothing of value was lost.
---
What im doing is not double think but what you are doing is extremely universal. It's called nuance blindness
---
1) I'm in a better position than you to see with my own eyes that there is a lot of miner broadcasting. I hunt these people's drones every day. But suddenly we got to assume all half afk lazy pvers to have korean esport level apm.
---
2) The person proving to be broadcasting uses it to legally to log in and accidentally left it on broadcasting something entirely harmless.  And was not banned after tons of propaganda threads. And is an important content creator.
---
So yeah, if you sufficiently ignore all these nuances you can end up perceiving people defending the right side as a double standard.
---
I know, it's quite unbelievable that someone would ever use a bit to mine. By the time CCP would ban the accounts the boter would have quadruple the isk invested.
---
Some still remember boot.ini case, trusting CCP (or nearly any other developer) with anything like that on something that's not dedicated for EVE decently isolated VM would be... adventureous at least. In that case detecting input broadcasting would be still near impossible (keyboard and mouse are software emulated in first place), and banning any kind of virtualization would mean blanket ban for anyone using whatever virtualization Windows uses for various features (XP Mode, Sandbox, development tools etc.) - in all those cases the Windows you see as "main system" is in fact virtualized.
---
Not to mention, creating custom simple input broadcasting for a game like EVE is entirely possible in most keyboard/mouse driver applications. I don't see many people being happy to uninstall whatever Logitech/Razer/Microsoft/Asus/whatever-else software they use for playing their RGB keyboards and other nice features just because someone somehow would use it in EVE. Or to stop using autohotkey for all the nice convenient stuff they set it to do.
---
There are just many significant technical issues when it comes to dealing with input broadcasting as it can be used in EVE, and those issues are nearly impossible to solve, especially given how small (relatively to Steam) EVE playerbase is, making tracking any custom input broadcasting tool even harder than for Steam etc. 1000 people cheating in popular Steam game using custom software is error margin, in EVE that'd be significant part of game population.
---
because it's a strong independent faction supercarrier that dont' need no support
---
Haha goons cheatings
---
I can't wait for the actual fucking disaster that is going to happen when they remove POSes
---
View the whole body.
---
Agreed with hot keys to launch and attacked on say alt q and alt w. Could just cycle alt tab, alt q, alt w. Litteraly just spam the buttons. Four  keys if you add in a key to cycle up the core. Still very low apm needed.
---
Sorry for asking, but I don't usually do this sort of pvp, but what's the ultimate goal there if you're indeed a small group looking for content? 
---
I feel like either of those against any medium or larger null group will get a pretty big response, one you might not be able to handle if you're indeed a smaller group.
---
And really not trying to start anything, but this seems to be a common answer and I'm curious as to how this actual situation plays out in reality. 
---
that woosh on the downvote army tho.
---
They are not banned, so they are no bots. Regarding to CCP. Now stop being a whiney bitch and go back to your 20 mil ticks.
---
i think manface missletits beats this one but this is pretty good
---
Make both illegal and then theres no question about accidents. Seriously, it takes me only about a minute to start up 6 accounts, and usually I don't need or use more then 3 at a time, the 6 is once in a super great while. WTF are automated login tools needed for ? Only more automating.
---
So you tag on an extra 1 minute to login your accounts if you ban isboxer or whatever else the fuck needs to be banned. And that is only for some people, most that log into multiple accounts don't use it cause there is no need.
---
That is a very small price to pay to be rid of all these shits put together.
---
The matter is about syncronisation upon launching them.
---
this is the best way to get into null for sure, ive never seen a gate camp through here
---
Yea but then there is no question of it being allowed or not and no question about a ban due to clarity of policy.
---
and again i call bullshit. you telling me you pressing 11 keys in under 1s...fuck off.  .09 seconds to press # and your drone recall at the same time.   
---
When the fastest active players in the world manage on average 3.3 actions per minute...you claim to double them on average...from a zero starting point.   
---
And no i don't blame you for using tools available, but stop bullshiting about under 1s, you ain't doing it under 1s, maybe at best under 2s, but id wager more likely if you are legit going alt+tab &gt; # you get 6 rorqs cleared in under 3.   
---
Ain't no way in hell you going from watching netflix to smashing 6+ actions a second. If you could do that you wouldn't be playing fucking EVE, you would be making money in esports as one of the highest APM guys on circuit.
---
Yes 
---
Titan hulls are under 50b each, they are pretty easy to get.
---
They do. Regular jump bridges did that, as do cyno beacons, advantage of the supercap umbrella, etc. etc.
---
Where can I run missions and be left the hell alone?
---
I understand that a lot of players like to kill people because they are bored waiting for some timer to station bash, but currently I'm only interested in doing a few things in the game, and PvP is not one of them.  I choose my play times based on the area I'm currently in being empty because I really don't want to spam d-scan while running missions.  I know that's how one is suppose to play the game, and I have to do that to complete my missions. 
---
I'm only working on level 3 missions for standings, because I Want to, and I fully understand that I'm not playing the game the way its suppose to be played.  I'm not playing EVE the way everyone else does, and I certainly have not found a nice home in a mega-corporation.
---
Is the only option joining (Insert mega-alliance here) and finding a deserted null sec pocket to run missions in?  They don't seem to like that. 
---
I've been in EvE Uni, and Brave Newbies.  I'll hold my personal feelings about those institutions to myself.  I've been spending a lot of time running Abyssal pockets, because its just me, or a few corpmates in frigates.  That's fun.  
---
I just want to PvE in relative peace.   What is your recommendation?   I really like the game, but what I want to do has shifted over the years.  I've spent time in blobs, and "small gangs (of 30+)" PvP and it simply is not fun for me, and it has never been. 
---
This is why people don't listen to the pitchfork brigade, ya don't know what you're talking 90% of the time.
---
That doesn't have to be input broadcasting.
---
In the past i was ratting c6 sites with around 30 drone boats and you can easy launch all drones in under 10 seconds.
---
He is probably using ISBoxer for window management and in this program (which is fine to use if you dont input broadcast) you can assign a hotkey to rotate through the game clients.
---
All you need to do now is assign an ingame hotkey to launch your drones and violently press both hotkeys and in the video you see the result you are getting doing this.
---
Highest value kill in the system for that day, week, month and ever recorded would be great.
---
If I've interpreted them right the main opinion I've seen thrown around is that subcaps are fun... but often a bad choice.  Which arguably makes it even worse because you have a fun option sitting there taunting you and it's a suboptimal play leading to failure if you pick it.
---
Are you aware of the possibility that I may be in Brand Newbros but also think that there not being costs to taking too much space in as allies is bad for the game?
---
&gt; option joining (Insert mega-alliance here) and finding a deserted null sec pocket to run missions in?  They don't seem to like that.
---
I've found Abyssal PvE to be nice, but a couple of times have come back from the Abyss to a frigate who promptly scans me. I'm sure I'm going to get suicide ganked at some point, which is my only complaint so far (and more avoidable if I move away from a major hub).  
---
How are people bothering you? Presumably in lowsec/nullsec?
---
Or have stuff get out just because you had no way of knowing whether they were still there or not (or if they logged/safelogged). First wave of chat problems caused me to miss some likely great kills just because of no way of saying that whether someone you waited hours to log back in got online or not. It's not clear "no local = more kills".
---
HAVE YOU HEARD OF A DELVE TIME UNIT?
---
Oh yeah, I forgot that playing Eve is like having a job that I pay for 😂
---
That would have a different spawn effect on screen. You can clearly see here the the launch effect of drones is sync and instant on multiple rorqs.
---
what is stainguy's weird obsession with PL, is this some slav thing
---
Am goon.
---
Still funny.
---
&gt;How are people bothering you? Presumably in lowsec/nullsec?
---
Maybe I should go back to Highsec, I'm currnently in a region with a good mix of High/low, and do lowsec mission running because its closeby. 
---
Now I don't mind the big fleets that come through and bash stations, but there are so many pirates that I have to be double careful.  I don't stay in the system if there are more than three people.  And even then, Sisters probe scanners on d-scan eventually pop up and I have to come back to finish my mission later.  
---
What could they possibly gain from exploding a 50m ISK ship?  Tears? Sure I guess.  I can only guess that spacerich mob bosses pay pirates per killmail. 
---
It's when someone uses an application that allows you to make one click happen on other clients at the same time. 
---
For example, if you're running 5x clients, rather than clicking 5 different times, you have one 'main' client and 4x 'slave' clients that follow exactly what your 'main' client does.   
---
It's against EULA.
---
What? 
---
Nice all caps but you're in lowsec and probably have exactly zero experience with what I'm talking about. 
---
Which is a bandaid and hinges on only playing around set piece timers lol 
---
Not a bad idea
---
I'm sure the irony doesn't escape you. 
---
Every single day forever? 
---
That doesn't make it a good solution/well written code though. I know full well why people write bad code. It's not that hard to write readable code. In fact, in most cases you'd spend about same amount of time writing a good comment that it would take you to make code readable in the first place.
---
There is a place for comments in code, but it's reserved for very specific cases, and should describe why it's doing what it's doing where the reasoning isn't obvious, rather than what it's doing.
---
You're overstating the difficulty of onlining a ansiblex on your own citadel. 
---
and now the world will know our little memorex is a feeder... lmao
---
It takes 0 seconds to write readable code so anyone can understand at a glance what's going on. Learn to write code properly, moron.
---
Ansiblexs flatten geography and homogenize space. 
---
&gt; Ansiblexes serve smaller ships, so no problem.
---
The meta has changed and is now almost solely extremely large fleets of smaller ships. 
---
It accomplishes much the same. 
---
It wasn't synchronized on launch. Each launch was split by maybe 1/4 to 1/2 a second depending on server ticks. You can clearly see it on the video. Clear evidence of input broadcasting would be all of the drones simultaneously appearing on your overview which they did not.
---
While I do not support Goonswarm Federation as they are literally ruining my EVE career I can tell you that this is not input broadcasting.
---
just for you: https://streamable.com/x2zoj
---
recorded 5 minutes ago. I started at ~10:00 and pressed the alt+tab -&gt; # combo 7 times. My last stroke of the # is at around ~11.13. You can download the file and replay it on VLC or something with very slow playback. This is 7 clients in around 1.1 seconds WITH sub optimal alt tab. 
---
I get your argument about reaction time when doing something else, but when my system is camped or a fresh neutral enters system, I'm not gonna be a spodbrain and be brain afk.
---
Having earned every ISK by honest gameplay i found this kind of shit disgusting.
---
And then there are the people who have 3, and test in production anyway.
---
Sure I agree I'd be fine with that. I'm sure Mar5hy would be fine too if nobody was able to broadcast in Eve. It rewards people with multitasking skill like me and him. But this post is not really about accidents. People just cling on one accident case because there were 10 threads for it. Miner broadcasting is much more rampant.
---
It's about when we say there is rampant Rorqual broadcasting going on, people asking for "proof". There can't be player obtained "proof" for most forms of broadcasting. Only CCP can proove it.
---
No way, I offer investment strategies and I need to advertise my business
---
&gt; Nice all caps but you're in lowsec and probably have exactly zero experience with what I'm talking about. 
---
yes my corp definitely hasn't spent the last few years doing exclusively nullsec warfare you fucking numpty
---
well if you destroy the gate they can't project force.
---
if you can't control the system to shoot a gate, or stop them from anchoring a new one, you are going to be the loser in these engagements.
---
Yeah it will seem that way on your end because of the server tick limitation.
---
But you can easy press one button to switch to the next client and press your hotkey for launching drones multiple times per second.
---
If you manage to do that 3 times/second which is easily achivable, 3 Rorquals will deploy their drones simultaniously on your end.
---
If the dude is input broadcasting, why doesn't he launching all drones at the same time? Yes yes, people will now say that he tries to be sneaky and fly under the radar but if that would be the case, he would launch his drones in a slower manner so that noone would suspect him for input broadcasting and then input broadcasting commands once the drones are in space and its harder to tell what he does from a bystander perspective.

Because it is bad. Code with lots of comments is like a book with lots of footnotes. Imagine reading a book where bottom half of each page is dedicated to explanations of what you just read in the top half just because the author couldn't express himself clearly in the first place. The only time when comments are acceptable is in case 4 mentioned below, when they are described why something is done the way it is, rather than what is being done. People who claim that comments are absolutely necessary clearly haven't written clean code, nor have been exposed to it.
---
maybe he has more fingers than you
---
In any single instance sure but I really and sincerely doubt your willpower will exceed a nullsec alliance's ability to drop 1b structures on their own citadels. 
---
ive been out of game for a while, have they gone back to the old chat or fixed the new one?  while not the only reason the local fuck up is one of the reasons i dropped out 
---
This is not a vanilla broadcasting case as well (in that case the launch would take 1 second). Most multiboxers in Delve are smarter now. They use round robin broadcasting and spam the key for each client. This one is virtually indistinguishable from a high apm player. If I had 28 Rorquals I would launch in 10 seconds.
---
So we are expected to believe  all these Rorqual multiboxers are high apm players.
---
You're a fucking tool mate
---
If you do that every day forever, like I said, then sure this is successful. I think you're underestimating the defensive advantage of being 200km off a Fortizar or Keepstar, though. 
---
That's nice but Ansiblexs weren't introduced years ago they were introduced several months ago. 
---
if the hostile forces can put down fort and keep chains into your space, it isn't your space and you've already lost.
---
It's more for something to do, especially if their goal is PVP. Your value is probably irrelevant, plus maybe you're running a sweet DED complex that they want to steal! :)

i know dipshit i have the blueprints for them 
---
I shall clue you in to what I'm talking about since you seem extremely lost as to what you're replying to. 
---
Detorid borders Immensea and Tenerifis. Alliances in those three regions all have jump bridge networks within their own sov on their own citadels that can be used to move fleets at a speed which is gamebreaking. 
---
i'm quite aware of the topology of that part of the map thank you
---
yes. people setup gates. 
---
shoot them. kill the ihubs.
---
if you can't do that, then you can't contest their forces anyway and this is a meaningless argument.
---
Oh so you should've known that the lAsT fEW yEaRs don't have any bearing on structures that have existed for a handful of months then. You're a very poor discusser. 
---
Easily spammed in the sense that if one is killed it is replaced with the only inconvenience being that of lost effect.

Pretty sure he knows lol, think he meant sacrastically that's called input broadcasting (not broadcast-inputting, as it says in the pic).

&gt; shoot them

If you do that every day forever, like I said, then sure this is successful. I think you're underestimating the defensive advantage of being 200km off a Fortizar or Keepstar, though.

No the issue is with every group like that. Nobody is complaining about response fleets. Fighting is good. PvP is good. Nobody has a problem with that. The issue is that on top of local giving perfect intel you have alliance only gates, citadels in every system (forget about engaging on the undock), toggle cyno jammers, mining platforms making your moon mining immune to anything but a large fleet. And all of those things are fine...except local. Because local without those is okay-ish. But add all those things and the issue becomes huge.

---
this video is not proof. you can, with the right set up of keybinds switch through clients very quickly (4-5 a second). The video also fails to show where the starting position of the drones which given he was mining and they were most likely at a random position around the rock they would have to travel making their return to each rorqual somewhat random 
---
I set the joystick on my G13 keyboard to switch between virtual desktops on Win10. I'd run one client per virtual desktop. I could go through clients so quickly that way. I never ran more than 4 clients. But I could easily perform a single button action across all 4 clients in a tick.

Look up "The magic 14" they're the skills to train off the bat. You dont need to rush them first, but they're all super useful for when you aren't sure what you're planning on training toward. (like while you're starting out) and are great fillers before you decide to fly logi and amass a months-long skill queue

Eh, 60 second immobilizer isn't so bad. That's like bastion. You can get out of that pretty quick. Considering you can go from locking frigs in minutes to about 10ish seconds it's still probably worth it.

well you're in the wrong mindset, ccp don't think that way. this is why they put the chat on their test server, with less people across the whole server than the chat would have to deal with daily in active tq systems (stagings, jita, so on), were told by the community it didn't work, and then pushed it to real server for us to all "enjoy" for 10 months
---
There is no context to the video, is this actually one guy?  Is this an edited video?  The small snippet answers none of these questions. CCP would draw 0 conclusions from this small clip and neither should we.

Ok I'm done. I dont have a webcam so I can't physically show you how I press 2 buttons really fast. If this was a macro wouldnt the time delay between button presses be the exact same for every combo?

Problem with caps is everyone has one and too many just deletes stuff, and single-point fights devolve quickly into awful TIDI slugfests. Aegis/Fozzie sov is actually ok if they'd just make it so you could shoot the nodes and reinforce sov with less timesink than a few months of cloaky camping.
---
Also more npc null is a yes please. One region in the web of the dronelands, one between lowsec and Stain (no direct gate between so still no bypassing catch/etc to get there), and one between Detorid and Tenerifis.
---
last time i checked horde were so shit that even most renters had enough sense to live in somebody else's space, drop a digit off your numbers and you'll be closer to the reality
---
&gt;What to do then?
---
&gt;Unfortunately we have no fool proof method else than reporting and hoping. 
---
There is not even a remote possibility that the lack of bannings are a result of lack of evidence. CCP doesn't want to ban because of ultimately unknown reasons, but we can certainly assume that some devs are friends with some of the worst offenders.
---
I lose local and alliance chat connection daily.  I've legitimately given up on CCP fixing chat.

if you slow the video to .25 you can see that his drones depart in similar increments, nearly 1s apart (my guess is around .75s apart). Its certainly 1 guy, but it most certainly not botting, or input broadcasting. The staggering of the drone retractions off the overview proves it. There isn't a drone in this game when even at max range that takes 8s to return.  
---
It's the responsibility of the game owners to deal with EULA violations. It's not the *responsibility* of glorified space guild leaders to deal with EULA violations put forth by the game company. 
---
&gt;  you have the power and in my opinion the responsibility to remove that Corp if it does not reform its ways.
---
The problem with what you're saying (or replying to) is the word responsibility. There is no obligation for space guild leaders to enforce CCP's eula on CCP's behalf. That's the crux of what I'm saying. I'm not saying it's *good* to let it happen but it's not their job to deal with it. They don't have the ability to ban people. They don't have access to server logs to investigate. They don't have the full account history in question. What they end up having in most cases is a he said she said situation and a choice between applying their time chasing after something that should be handled by a more qualified group (CCP) or running fleets for their members, working on corp / alliance services and so on. Sometimes you get low hanging fruit - and pretty much every large group tends to awox that fruit - NC, PL., Test, Horde, Goons etc. included. 
---
The entire point of this is that trying to pin any form of third party tool related issue on any player run group to combat is unreasonable from the get go. Should groups kick known botters? Yes, I think they should. Is it their *responsibility* to do so? No. Should they be expected to devote the resources needed to effectively combat this? No. Should they if they are able? Yes.
---
Lol sure all the null bear want local to remain because it would mean less kill and they are so PvP orientated
---
I commented because you are fucking lying about "doing it under 1s" you need 3rd party programs to accomplish that. 
---
How am I lying if I comment:
---
&gt; With EvE-O preview and 1 hotkey I can do this with my 6 Accounts in like 1 second.
---
I very cleary state that I use a 3rd party program, but I dont even have to if you look at the video, it just makes my life easier. It's also under 1 second if I just do 6 accounts, I did 8 in the video.
---
&gt;If I set "Recall to drone bay" to G button and then in mouse driver set that pressing MB7 emits "G" keycode (effectively: broadcasts pressing "G" to active window) is that considered bannable or not?
---
As long as one command is caused by pressing/clicking something manually, it should be fine.
---
When i first joined everyone in hisec was carebears and nullsec was the place to be if you were hardcore. Now everyone moved to null and now "wormholes are hardcore" and everyone who lives in null is a carebear. So when everyone moves into wormholes what are you going to call the wormhole carebears?
---
Its already banned. The problem is CCP wont ban.
---
That is an extremely small number of Titans. They should stop being poors.
---
Wow poaching before the even join now... That's some 4d shit 
---
&gt;I'm not saying some one is/isn't broadcasting/botting one way or another - i just think there are more compelling and convincing pieces of evidence than some drones being recalled.
---
So we should be looking for perfection.

Don’t let Pearl Abyss see this they’ll pull the plug on Eve immediately!

As much as I agree with you, it would would probably have weird consequences on the market for skill injectors to give any Omega in a date range the SP.

Oh no, not *some* of your accounts. HTFU.
---
Well, unfortunately, on that you are correct, we as players do not have the tools and it seems like CCP are the tools in these cases and all others like them across the whole game.
---
then no loss if its banned. 1 t1 frig flying newb just starting out &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; multiboxing most likely input brodcasting or botting rorq fleet.

I use the Uplift Desk by Human Solutions - https://www.thehumansolution.com/uplift-standing-desks.html

A+++ would buy again
---
&gt;Can we seriously change the trend? Please... soon. Let's make caps about sov and structures. Let's make sub-caps about pvp fleets and warfare. I don't care how, even if it doesn't make sense, just separate the two from all possibilities of confronting one another.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Okay... maybe I'll start with some ideas. How about if players have to utilize sub-caps to shoot structures into it's first reinforcement stage, and then they need capitals to finish it off. Sub-caps needed to start the sov process, then capitals needed to finish it off. Capitals can only lock other capitals and structures... sub-caps can lock anything.  
---
&gt;We need something... anything.  
---
&gt;Oh and while we are at it... why not add more null space? Stir the pot CCP! Create more races and factions... link the new space to existing space near these lesser used low-sec areas.  
---
&gt;Okay... I'm done.
---
Or just straight out completely get rid of the balance cliff, the gaps, remake it all on a straight line. Either way would work a ton of good ideas people have posted everywhere and some bad ones. Some of them I have seen truly way overcomplicated and impractical, but some were super simple and no brainers.
---
At this point the question isn't really " what can be done ? " but rather why isn't it done yet when its been around forever. Personally I don't think CCP is capable any longer of addressing such issues, they lack people, they lack money, etc. etc.  Its a downward spiral and not just with this issue but with many.
---
Ooof.
---
But it's ok when goons do it.
---
Another raging success for hedliner.
---
Join the marauders club. O wait, actually they'd need to multiply the cap production costs like x10 or x20, maybe even x30 in order to be on the same curve as marauders when considering the balance graph.

There are some devs, or at least employees that take part of development, on Everquest that are literally younger or same age as the game.

lmao the mental gymnastics. This is why I hate big alliances. People that are probably decently intelligent in their day to day life throw away all that reason and intellect for tribal loyalty.  
---
Here's a suggestion Jay. Make a neutral toon and try to hunt people in Delve. Just try it. See how many bots insta warp off and how much of this shit is going on right under your nose. But you deny it because it's your tribe. And don't get me wrong. GOTG does it, NCPL does it, Legacy does it, Ranger Regiment does it. It's everywhere. All of nullsec is a corrupt cesspool of shit.
---
How do you make a naked capsuleer? I thought you can't
---
This does not look remotely like input broadcasting.
---
You can bind keys to "Next Window" (in your desktop OS / window manager) and "Launch Drones" (in-game).
---
When I was mining "Launch Drones" was frequently an action I did not combine with others because it takes time to execute and the next action, "Engage Target", is dependent on them being launched and kind of goofy about it.
---
The sequence was usually 'Alt-PgDn' 'Alt-W' and no other commands, which in practice involved holding Alt while slapping PgDn and W alternately as fast as I could, and I dare say I launched mine as fast if not faster than this fully manually.
---
Yeah guys how can we make nullsec even safer. It's not safe enough yet.
---
Not anymore it doesn't! Heueuhuehuehuehru
---
i am well aware that there are bots in every organisation but a lot of the time its just some salty dude posting that someone was paying attention and recalled their drones. The vid of the 28 ships pulling drones probably is broadcasting, but 12 is within what i would call doable.
---
And ze panzerkampfwagen. We aren't taking chances here. 
---
How much are you selling that brand new spin master for?

do you know what the numbers on the region page

(http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/The_Kalevala_Expanse)
---
next to the system names are? (the ones usually sitting at 5)
---
i used to think they were adms because they seem to steadily increase when a system is reset but now that you've pointed it out i see that the adm listed on the system page is listed there and is different from this number
---

HED-GP
---
1) can we get another one of those botter murder fests where ccp just spawns supers? That was awesome.
---
2) this is prob botting but doesnt seem conculsive to me.
---
3) ccp are responsible for banning bots not the players
---
4) even if all goon bots disappeared tomorrow and no others across new eden, goons would still be the same economic power house.  For better or worse no other group has even tried this economic model. 
---
he is probably using multiple computers and the gap between groups is him moving his mouse to the next display in synergy or something
---
this is literally EXACTLY what it would have looked like when I went to launch my drones as a fully manual rorqual multiboxer, down to there being multiple groups that would be slightly offset
---
No spin here. Just bored and at least horde finds the balls to form for good fights. Not like this shit affects the srp wallet or players wallets in real amounts anyways

---
Let’s just get rid of of all local chat. If this happens botters will die, unsub, CCP will shutter and we can all finally quit playing Eve.
---
Many competetive games have built in anti cheat tools. They don't force you to uninstall drivers or your keyboard / mouse utilities, they just don't allow their full use in their games and ban you if you do. And they still have milions upon milions of people playing them every single day across the whole world.
---
Also, I actually happen to have Logitech utilities running right now, since you brought it up. I have a generic K120 Keyboard and a G703 Mouse. There is absolute zero chance of any of my mouse or keyboard macros activating accidentally, because in order to do so, I have to set it up for Eve Online from within them. Likewise for the MS Windows macros. 
---
So no, you are just plainly wrong. Though at least it tells me you have never used any of these things anywhere or you would know. These function as regular plain old mice except the extra buttons, which is still fine by CCP as long as its 1 action on 1 client per 1 input. So you are 100% wrong and incorrect. I could of course set it up for a string of actions or broadcast to different displays, VMs, client windows, etc. But I have to do it, knowingly, and specifically for Eve, won't happen just with me hitting random shit in all those settings.
---
And if I wanted to use MS Windows or Office macros ? Heh, that REALLY takes a lot of time and effort to set up for Eve. There is no way, not even remotely possible to accidentally do this.
---
&gt;They fessed up to dropping the ball

I was in your camp. Now am not, for a wide plethora of reasons. Sooner or later it will affect you too, and the funny thing is, that when it happens, it will actually happen 1st and then you'll realize it way down the line and you'll react that much stronger about it.

Wormholes

If it would be that many but its 1 or 2 from my 3 accounts x) 
---
Fuck yeah
---
idk why you're being downvoted, jita local and local in highsec has been fucked consistently so far in February 
---
Yes, naturally, instead of the set of large scale multiboxers possibly intersecting the set of high APM players they must just be cheating in a different way because you can't kill their excavators.
---
I mean they couldn't possibly have become well-rehearsed at launching and recalling drones after their 42069th ore site with tryhard mouthbreathers like you no-lifing for excavator kills the whole way, right?
---
Which way is Delve?
---
&gt;He launched all drones of 28 Rorquals within 10 second.
---
ridiculously easy

FC does this count as the "OP" being complete?

..
---
...
---
Then realize that's literally all it takes to cycle through clients performing a single hot key action and shut the ever-loving fuck up for the remainder of your natural life you fucking moron
---
I think shit fights drive off players. Roam some friends were on with some frigs and cruisers maybe 10 people max had a response fleet with 7 logic chase them. Another one was a small desy roam into init space had titans try to chase them. Kind of overkill be it our fc  seems to love running fleets into j5a to die lol
---
what the fuck do you mean 'high apm'
---
everyone on this subreddit is a fucking retard for thinking this is difficult to do
---
there is nothing wrong with round robin, and even without it it's literally ALTERNATING TWO BUTTON CLICKS, and if you can't do that 28 times in 10 seconds you're not trying hard enough, or haven't done it 50 times a day for the past year like this guy.
---
Not good but part of family, can confirm funny 
---
I'd like to see an NS equivalent of FOBs, they'd be more like Keepstars on super steroids and send out titan / super fleets to belts, gates, stations ... Hmmmm, got a problem with too many Rorquals while combat PvE players lacking challenge ? Wheres CCP when you need them ?
---
Nah. I just think no one realises CCP has no intention to ever combat botters.

Be the change you wish to see

It's a bad choice because of bad game design.

How would I even start something like that

Agreed. I reupped my Omega status after a long hiatus in May. Have encountered plenty of chat issues since then...
---
On a bit more serious note, the Kill for your Tengu is showing only 1 Caracal rat doing a total of only 16127 damage, looking at your fit, how could it have kill you ? Were you completely AFK ? Did you accidentally decloak and go AFK or something ?
---
So are you going to tell me or just throw shitty shade?
---
Please tell me the characters name is 'Locutus'
---
I've been playing this game for over a decade now, back when people ran 20 bombers alts, or 12 dread alts, or 10 Corm alts in a FW plex all with input broadcasting before it was banned by CCP. I've had to deal with it in many ways but the way and I've always seen it as it's a tool that everyone has access too and I'm not gonna fault them for using their resources to give them the edge when I can do the exact same thing. 
---
I think it should be much more agressive then that, the more rats and belts get farmed in a system, the more they should come out to play, in addition the size and scope of the NPC station, ships it launches etc. etc. should be properly scaled to what the rats targets are, so Keepstars, Rorqs, Titans, all that.
---
This is starting to remind me of World War 1 trench warfare.  
---
It wasn't one. It was 20. The kestrel tackled me while I was bashing a structure, I tried to kill the kestreal but I was in hams, he was getting logi'd hard, then all the caracals swapped onto me as target.
---
delve has lots of people, try there
---
Not everyone in the system appears in local. So while your local may say that the 10 people in system are all friendly, there's also that 11th guy who's not and you can't see him.
---

&gt; there is nothing wrong with round robin
---
Round robin gives unfair advantage by automating alttab. You and isboxer folks probably think CCP should not intervene whats going on outside client. But nowhere in the policies CCP talks about such a limit. If there is any detection for round robin, CCP can and should intervene.
---
If people let me round robin, I can literally take the game back to "one guy controlling 40 bombers conducting solo bombing run" days, given that I get a computer that can handle.
---
Amatuer.. let us show you how it is done.

ya but how much to buy a succesfull campaign?
---
If I dispute this I have to do work so....
---
LOL, maybe i'll go join PH or karmafleet on a Ferox capable alt just for this shit.
---
Npc killmails are like that. Even if a goddamn npc fleet kills you, only the last rat will show up on the km.
---
Don't remind me, I still remember when it was released :-(
---
Gotcha, so they are all just showing as 1 on the KM. That is a bug my friend. If its players flying 20 ships, even same ones in same fits they show up as different ships, different pilots, but the KM is showing just 1 Caracal.
---
You and your friend need to get out of high sec. Join Horde.
---
I was wrong Olmeca look at me gold is as funny as glevon gobblin.
---
Titan skills, on the other hand, not so much. Sure, if you know what you're doing you can min/max it okay, but don't forget to add the time it takes you to learn enough about the game to min/max your titan alt.
---
Just cause you can, doesn't mean you should. Just cause they can, doesn't mean they should.
---
Thats weird, I never noticed that. Then again, I never really looked at my NPC deaths.
---
Pirate faction sotiyos are a thing already. Afaik fobs are just downgraded sotiyos. And someone correct me if i'm wrong but npc miners do have bounties. 
---
If you're going to include production, you should probably subtract imports as well, or at least in part. Not everything that you need to build stuff can be found in Delve. 
---
Camp 40 bombers cloaked by their gate and bait them in ? 
---
Explaining a joke makes it 7.5% funnier per every level of whoosh trained.
---
The NPC miners are a whole different thingy on their own not related to FOBs and Sotiyos etc. You can go after their haulers too which can actually be OK if you have something to scoop up the ore with.
---
Now I know, what I meant is that the Sotiyos are entirely inadequate in light of multiboxing Rorq fleets, cap umbrellas, etc. We need PvE that will challenge cap umbrellas, in a relatively decent manner, give them a loss rate equivalent to that of at least the lossrate found in T5 Abyss sites. 
---
&gt;But suddenly we got to assume all half afk lazy pvers to have korean esport level apm.

I think all goons are korean esport players.

**CHANGE MY MIND**

They dont wanna ban.

I read that fucking wall of text and it ends in a fucking JoJo reference... Bravo sir!
---
They already had one, they're just fucking around now. 
---
How do they lose?
---
&gt; So we should be looking for perfection.
---
you should be looking for a little bit more than "oh look, everyone's doing the same thing because it's the only reaction you can have in this situation".
---
Or there are plenty of AUTZ corps in The Imperium. 
---
B/c game development is hard.. I guess... I dunno either tbh
---
Well no one is able to proof if anyone left any software running by accident.

If there getting caught there should get punished, no matter if goon or PH,PL or mar5hy.

Breaking a rule is breaking a rule.

It's possible I'm retarded, but I read it as Omega accounts March 20th onward gets sp, whereas if you cancelled your Omega on March 19th and didn't resub you're shit outta luck. 
---
Fuck knows with CCP anyway, it's probably what you think.
---
Whats a little bit more?
---
Depending on the time of the day as much as 50% of the "players" might be broadcasters/bots. If something doesnt look "human", it probably isnt.
---
So...
---
* Nobody complaining about response fleets
---
* Fighting is good
---
*PVP is good
---
*Nobody has a problem with that
---
What you have an issue with is how EVERYBODY plays the game. Do you even undock bruh? Seriously, who  is your main? Show us that you actually do ANYTHING in the game, otherwise you are just a pathetic reddit troll, ho can't get any kind of positive reinforcement in real life, so you have to come here to try to make yourself appear to be relevant.
---
I am getting nothing, my dude.
---
I mean, OP's question is different from the usual "null content is dead" stuff. He's asking about r64s and SBUs, or in other words getting fleet fights with nullblobs, not wormholers nuking ratters or small gang dudes styling on nullblob line members. 
---
Vily's right in that there are a ton of things you can do that are essentially content buttons. The problem is that these days the "content" tends to be more than most people can manage; most of the game has at least one of the big four null alliances on batphone, and supercap fleets are more powerful than ever. 
---
According to reddit, ALL of nullsec is botters. Which I dare say, is far more than 1000 people. Something's gotta give. Something has to be done to rid the game - ALL GAMES - of cheaters.
---
Idk, not funny imo. Sad af. 
---
&gt;i'm more inclined to believe a guy is input broadcasting if you can prove all those accounts are owned by the same person than a bunch of drones all got pulled at once.
---
for starters.
---
it's not even one isolated thing, it's a bunch of things. one in isolation isn't much of an indicator.
---
Sold
---
No, go away!
---
So what you're saying is that we should assume it is due to skill when you do it, and due to cheating when anyone else does it, and moreover that this should be enough for CCP to act on?
---
CCP has many tools at their disposal for VERY accurately determining if any given individual is broadcasting.
---
To many of the slowbrains around here, 5-10 seconds apparently seems like an instant.
---
In fact It's entirely possible to manually multibox at rates of 10+ actions per second for well-rehearsed single-hotkey sequences.
---
You can even do multiple-hotkey unordered sets at this rate trivially, e.g. you set the hotkey for action 1 to q, the hotkey for action 2 to w, action 3 to e, next window to r then you could just slap 'qwer' repeatedly.
---
In a quick trial I was able to hit the 4 characters in this set at a sustained rate of 28 chars per second with one hand and not even really trying.
---
I don't think 10 seconds or "how good I am" or any other arbitrary limit you or any other retard sets defines the upper limit of capability here, particularly considering virtually every attempt at identifying an input broadcaster is a false accusation and obviously not input broadcasting to anyone with the slightest bit of higher brain function.
---
Fortunately with the server timestamps and client introspection CCP has an absolute and foolproof toolkit for identifying actions occurring at truly inhuman speeds (which, btw, are separated by enough orders of magnitude that your mom could squeeze comfortably inbetween them) and if client side manipulation is involved at ambiguous speeds respectively, so they do not need you to provide any evidence at all or interpret it for them.  Just push the report button and shut the fuck up.
---
Who still has that message appear?
---
Right. Theast war was all about that. And totally not about who had to most titans.
---
Unless you consider fucking around hisec citadels as the new meta.
---
probably not
---
You means the aids bridges? Fuck that.
---
I use isboxer to manage my windows, you cannot enable input broadcasting by accident.
---
Nice br from three days ago.
---
20 dollars is 20 dollars...
---
Cool. So I ran a lvl 1 earlier in a zealot and it kicked ass. Wondering how it will fare in a lvl 4 or 5? (Abyss)
---
Here’s my fit: 
---
5x t2 medium pulse laser w/scorch or navy multifreqs 
---
Large cap battery
---
Fleeting web 
---
Named mwd 
---
2x adaptive nano (t2)
---
2x t2 heat sinks 
---
2x overdrive 
---
Medium t2 Armor rep
---
5x hobgoblin II 
---
Em pump rig 
---
Nano accelerator rig 
---
Most of the fit is tech2. Some named stuff. Nothing faction or officer. 
---
The biggest problem I’ve had is running short on time so I can’t get all the drops. So I took off a heat sink and added a second over drive and swapped my AB for a MWD. Now I can cruise while killing the spawns, then turn on the jets for sprinting to drops and gates. Previously I would get out with less then 20seconds, missing 1-2 drops. Ran this, and was done - cleared everything with 4 minutes to spare. This is in a lvl 1 tho. How would it translate up to higher lvls? 
---
Its amazing how quickly people are to talk shit after goons crushed the north towards the end of the summer.
---
&gt;But I think, when people are discussing broadcasting on reddit etc., inductive evidence should count.
---
But only if the evidence is pointing to the miners, right? 
---
With x-mouse and a lot of screen real-estate (or an efficient window manager like ISBoxer) **there's no need to alt-tab at all**. Hovering the mouse over a window is enough to move focus so you can issue commands in quick succession.
---
You are asking for evidence that you know only CCP can have, and you also shape the narrative so if the cheater is on a VPN, it still becomes a "not sure".
---
When the game is invaded by trash, you have to lower the bar.
---
Wait what

Well a skill farming account with 3 characters produces what 10-12 injectors per month? The 500k SP means an extra free one so about 8-10% more skill injectors produced than usual. Also any account that would otherwise buy one getting one for free should drive prices down.
---
This post is better suited for /r/evejobs :)
---
yea.. i dunno .. that would be 600k at MAX, and 50k at min, that would make perfect sense to me 
---
when did you sub? bc you could just ask CCP nicely and they are likely to give you the free sp aswell (they do that w/ plex sales if you JUST bought some for regular, so i dunno why they should not do this aswell) 
---
soon™
---
Wasn't it Kavelala?
---
Dude the entire game isn't bots.
---
It doesn't take everyone being a bot for a system of VNIs, which can fight practically nothing in typical ratting fits, to scatter in seconds.
---
It has always been hard to catch human players that are actually paying attention, people are watching you move through the region on intel and probably even have alts up and down a pipe if they're in VNIs.  They're safing up when your +1 in local confirms your next system.
---
Sure, maybe there are some bots in there too, but don't act like most human players flying a VNI in that situation won't react similarly and as close to quickly as it needs to be for it not to matter as to whether you're catching them.
---
Now divide those numbers by roughly 20k and you get the income per player. 🤔
---
Reeeeeeeeeeee... Serkanner the BRAVE sitting in his uber Titan!!!! Reeeeeeeeeeeeee... You go away, snot nose.

Which is fair because the other accounts were not affected by the chat fuckery... Oh wait
---
Legacy supers were staged in ERVK , FAX were there also. Tapi used brick tanked Eagles repped by Minos for the entosis. I think you’re just confused tbh, no hard feelings.
---
Somewhat new to the game. 
---
I’ve got a somewhat good fit on a destroyer and I hate PVP.  What’s something I can do to make isk while I continue to learn the game?
---
Even with current numbers that's still more bugs and issues than the old chat
---
I do, every time I rig a T3 cruiser.
---
How many did they have with the old chat system? 
---
Have you ever considered suicide?
---
I mean, neither is yours or mine or anybody elses on this subreddit so vOv
---
Like seriously? I never used isboxer. 
---
Something totally different, but why not?
---
Just like most of Eve, there are some things that appeal to certain people and some things that don't. It's a great idea, and best of all it doesn't hurt those that are against it. I'm sure CCP has looked into adding more space and this would be a great option for it. 
---
Miner, calm down.
---
That would be pointless since you already have FW plexes. Frigates are just as safe in a PLEX as in an entire system with PLEX-like mechanics. 
---
CCP will probably just increase the variety of PVP arenas with 3v3s etc. which is a much more surefire way to provide people with dank 1v1 fights of any ship class. I personally don't like that it's a gated arena that enforces engagement rules completely but whatever. 
---
Most of the people have this already disabled. So probably no one noticed till now - including CCP devs.

Was there a non-miner broadcaster whose evidence I rejected? Don't talk just to talk mate.
---
Lmao, ok buddy.
---
NPC damage only shows up as a total from all NPCs of the faction.  Not sure if multiple NPC factions can show up as separate damage entries, but people are free to test that out somehow.
---
Fuck off carebear.
---
Can i use this to create new post on this subreddit?
---
If you want, sure
---
&gt; So what you're saying is that we should assume it is due to skill when you do it, and due to cheating when anyone else does it
---
It's not about the name or alliance who does it. It's about their ingame activity. I'll assume the Chinese zombie semi afk RMT miner to be round robin broadcasting when they release 25 sets in 8 seconds. None of us can know for sure. But I am the one making the best use of evidence available.
---
Meanwhile, I twitch my activity publicly. So ofc you should assume it's skill when it's me. I'm providing you grade A evidence.
---
&gt; Just push the report button and shut the fuck up.
---
That was one of the points, you idiot. It's highly likely that they are not doing anything vs Rorqual broadcasters. How do you know they are enforcing their rules, before spewing retard confidence hatred here?

This is for pvp and fleet wars you bottom dweller.

&gt; Round robin gives unfair advantage by automating alttab.
---
as long as a keyboard input only produces one eve action, it's legal. any number of windows OS or whatever else actions doesn't matter.
---
you could set things up so that pressing a key launches your drones in game, alt-tabs, takes a screenshot, plays a song in winamp, turns on your smart lightbulb, and makes a post on reddit bragging about stealing another excavator. that's legal, because 1 keypress equals 1 eve action.
---
&gt; If people let me round robin, I can literally take the game back to "one guy controlling 40 bombers conducting solo bombing run" days
---
those days never left, round robins was never outlawed. the couple of guys that were well known for doing it didn't get banned, they just quit. probably because paying for or plexing dozens of bomber accounts is dumb as fuck.
---
Fyi you can send a command to at least 4 or 5 accounts in one server tick depending on how fast your computer is.
---
For me to drop drones (haven't bothered making pulling drones 1 key press) I can just tab&gt;r 10 times and it'll get like 4 out at the same time before my computer starts lagging on the 5th or 6th account.
---
Did you know that the FRT population has increased by 5000 in the last 2 months, which includes a lot of alpha VNI?One person even has 60 VNI free character accounts，not including other types of bots. Do you know why plex has grown so quickly recently?Buying 100 million ISK in China costs just 60 cents, which is lower than the CCP's official price.
---
Thanks. What is GOTG?
---
Window management lets me nerf a background clients frame rate while still being on 1 monitor and in view.   
---
e.g. [https://i.imgur.com/38xpcnh.png](https://i.imgur.com/38xpcnh.png)  
---
The things that are banned as far as I know are broadcasting to all clients and ui manipulation. The latter is where you take elements from 1 client and lay them onto a "main" client, so that could be several overviews, modules etc.
---
&gt; as long as a keyboard input only produces one eve action, it's legal. those days never left, round robins was never outlawed. 
---
1 stroke 1 action is a myth lurking around isboxer channels, so isboxing people can feel good about themselves. I am yet to see a dev citation for that. Choosing to read CCP policy as is (no unfair advantage) seems like a better move.
---
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7q63gu/ccp_peligro_you_wont_find_the_security_team/) is a bunch of guys banned for round robin. Here is what a GM says: " "Whether or not you use "overlays", round-robin or input broadcasting features, using third party software at all to change the way the game is played, is essentially against the rules."
---
&gt; you could set things up so that pressing a key launches your drones in game, alt-tabs, takes a screenshot, plays a song in winamp, turns on your smart lightbulb, and makes a post on reddit bragging about stealing another excavator. that's legal, because 1 keypress equals 1 eve action.
---
This is not legal not because there is a 1 keypress 1 action rule. It is legal because none of the activities you cite gives you unfair advantage. Meanwhile, if you tab between 25 clients in 3 seconds to spam keystrokes to retrieve excavators, to save them from death, that is unfair advantage. This is why, if I actually bombed a fleet with 40 bombers using round robin, I'd be banned quickly fast.
---
Just because you got away with it doesn't mean it's legal. I'm not sure CCP even has people looking at broadcaster cases anymore.
---
You can rf them anytime.  Also you are playing around set piece timers anyway, that's what sov warfare is about. 
---
You obviously haven't played faction war in a while. This would be nothing like it at all. Instead of knocking down ideas try and improve on it. 
---
&gt; At least you are admitting that these are advantages instead of denying them. And attackers don't have a counter play to these advantages. Not mechanically.
---
They aren't mechanical advantages. A mechanical advantage is something you get from the system. All these advantages you cry about are given by the alliance. Counterplay is available. The counterplay is "burn it down". 
---
&gt;Gladly but with so many advantages local isn't necessary anymore. Or give attackers more tools to match these other ones. Alliance gates, citadels, mining platforms...they do nothing for attackers. Give us tools for it. Fair?
---
So, local isn't "needed anymore". What happens when someone finally decides to get the head out of his arse and removes citadels and destroy all the umbrella? Then you are left with? What? Right, nothing. 
---
&gt;Yes very addressed. More risk makes it more difficult thus making it more valuable. So many krabs are crashing the value of ISK. Plex is up to 2 billion a month almost. Ores are lowest value ever. Ships are extremely cheap. Money has been devalued by the over abundance of krabbing.
---
and how has that not been a good thing? MORE DESTRUCTION happened because of it. How is "high ship prices" a somewhat beneficial state in the game? It's not! Lower ship prices benefit everyone ffs. 
---
&gt;Ha so you admit yourself roaming gangs will be more active. And if less people PVE...you think maybe...they might fight each other? OH HOW AWFUL!?!?!?!?!? That's the point. You're getting it now. This game should be more about roaming and pvp than krabbing. We have TOO many herbivores, with TOO many defenses driving away the carnivores. You need to have balance between that or your eco system goes to shit.
---
The Data suggests =&gt; Less RISK means more PvE and more PVE means more PVP. 
---
MORE RISK =&gt; LESS PVE AND LESS PVP. 
---
FFS, is it so hard to understand? MORE RISK does NOT equal more destruction. Simply because the majority of targets are PvE players they just won't undock if it's too risky. 
---
The economy won't benefit from their doings and you can't hunt them anymore. That's bad and you know that. 
---
&gt;Well let's see if people actually brought gangs to fight us we'd be just fine with that. Like you said, roaming gangs will be more motivated to be out there. So more targets for us that want to fight. That's good. We want this in the small gang community.
---
But they won't find much targets. Without PvE in Space, there is no reason to fight you anyway and it's not like you would grow a pair when you can't fight targets and suddendly start attacking available assets. 
---
You could have so much content it's not even funny. Thousands of citadels, attack one and see what happens. Oh wait, you can't win that so you tuck your tail between your legs instead. 
---
No, you are delusional. You think that with less targets in space people would fight more lol. :D
---
&gt;Yes CCP GAVE Them to you. CCP GAVE you tools to protect yourself.
---
CCP allowed us the option built them as much as CCP gave you the option to destroy them. 
---
What CCP didn't do is: Sent us build Titans, Supers, Carriers, Citadels, Cynojammers, Jump Bridges, 200 people willing to defend the space, organization. 
---
So, how can you, in a good conscious, claim that CCP handed all of that too us and how can you claim that you can't do anything against that? Oh well, I tell you why: 
---
&gt;I have about 50 billion liquid
---
because that isn't even enough for 2 supers. That's why you can't and that's why you won't have a chance against alliances unless you grow a pair and put those assets on the line. But as I said earlier, you won't, cause losing that isk would mean you have to earn it back somehow and that would be something you dislike. 
---
I understand that, but that doesn't mean the system is rigged against you, because it isn't. 
---
Did you know that the Fraternity's population has increased by 5000 in the last 2 months, which includes a lot of alpha VNI?One person even has 60 VNI free character accounts, not including other types of bots. Do you know why plex has grown so quickly recently?RMT,buying 100 million ISK in China costs just 60 cents, which is lower than the CCP's official price.plex and skill injectors are safe to trade in the same company or alliance.
---
You're the one that literally yelled at him and told him to go away. Why don't you try calming down? 
---
Sounds like wormholes. Why make more empty space when this already exists?
---
&gt; Well no one is able to proof if anyone left any software running by accident.
---
You can use your reasoning faculties to reach to that conclusion. If a guy has no reason/activity to broadcast except legal ones (logging in 80 accounts), then it means he accidentally broadcasted in chat (which had no benefit to him at all).
---
Oh I have it disabled as well it just doesn't make sense for it to show up for t3 since that is specifically listed as one of the benefits
---
Kid might have been conceived in the great downtime of '05. 
---
The guy he talks about accidentally left it open, because he was using it to log in 80 accounts (which is probably legal).
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Like it's just 1 or 2 people who joined the game or resubbed in the last 329 days.
---
I had a day where both my toons would load the chat for the system I logged in in and then never switch, I had constant eyes on local for my home system even in jita so coulda been worse ig.
---
I guess it comes down to drone management, it's pretty easy to defang an astero. 
---
No one has made a good soundboard in a while, but we’ve had a ton of gold as of late. I’m too lazy and stupid though. 
---
&gt; doubling our numbers, trying to headshot me every time, and dropping caps on us

I too remember when Brave weren't Goon pets.
---
As far as I know launching automatically via isboxer died with the splash screen, these days it goes through either the official launcher or (until recently) the isboxer launcher. Which at that time (to my knowledge) did not have the capability to auto launch accounts. Now the official launcher has a launch as group option, so either way it should not be an issue going forward since the isboxer eve launcher died in the last update anyway.
---
I think he meant most people have clicked “don’t show again”, probably even the devs which I guess is how they missed it.

WHY THE FUCK WERE HALF OF YOU NOT ALIGNED?

do you often stalk random reddit users for wrongthink?
---
&gt;A camper uses broadcasting for logging in. Broadcasting logins is allowed and not harmful. If he gets caught it is safe to believe it was an accident.
---
" Let's make caps about sov and structures. Let's make sub-caps about pvp fleets and warfare "... is there a difference???
---
Not really.
---
Most people are unimaginative ducks, or lazy, and generally have a naming convention for their characters. 
---
I know I do, cos I'm both lazy and unimaginative. 
---
Yeah they'll just buy a couple sebos lol
---
It also means that someone who stopped playing right after the change and only experienced a day of unreliable chat is getting something, and people who have been living with it for nearly a year are getting nothing.
---
You didn't tick the box, that's why.
---
I we merely pointing out how Imperium is outraged about other people botting/input broadcasting when they are INFESTED with the above offenders and I'm pretty sure this gives them HUGE advantage over other groups that don't do it or not at this autistic scale...

Hypocritical to say the least...

---
Realistically its pretty dumb if en masse, but a rare attempt by a small fleet would be kind of nice actually. Or just spawn FOB variants in null which go after structures across the region a couple of times a month.
---
&gt; They aren't mechanical advantages. A mechanical advantage is something you get from the system. All these advantages you cry about are given by the alliance. Counterplay is available. The counterplay is "burn it down". 
---
No these things are gameplay mechanics. I get that you farmed them and built them, but CCP put these modifications into the game. If CCP gave wormhole small gang crews the ability to DD from wormhole space into your Rorquals what then? Would you say "well they built that titan in the wormhole so they earned it." Of course not. You'd point out how the GAMEPLAY MECHANIC is fucked.
---
&gt; So, local isn't "needed anymore". What happens when someone finally decides to get the head out of his arse and removes citadels and destroy all the umbrella? Then you are left with? What? Right, nothing while the attacker still has his mechanical advantages. :) Good job, your true motivation right there. Disadvantage the prey. 
---
CCP isn't removing capitals or citadels. Glad you recognize what you are though: prey.
---
&gt; and how has that not been a good thing? MORE DESTRUCTION happened because of it. How is "high ship prices" a somewhat beneficial state in the game? It's not! Lower ship prices benefit everyone ffs. 
---
Okay then answer this. Why not make all ships 1 isk? If cheap ships directly means more destruction which is good, just make every ship 1 isk. Please answer this.
---
&gt; The Data suggests =&gt; Less RISK means more PvE and more PVE means more PVP. 
---
Citation needed.
---
&gt; MORE RISK =&gt; LESS PVE AND LESS PVP. 
---
&gt; FFS, is it so hard to understand? MORE RISK does NOT equal more destruction. Simply because the majority of targets are PvE players they just won't undock if it's too risky. 
---
If krabs are easier to kill....and more pvpers start roaming to kill them...do you think it's more or less likely of a chance that pvp groups will roam into each other? Answer this.
---
&gt; But they won't find much targets. Without PvE in Space, there is no reason to fight you anyway and it's not like you would grow a pair when you can't fight targets and suddendly start attacking available assets. 
---
Yes you will find targets. They'll simply be those pvpers instead of krabs. More small gang fighting small gang.
---
&gt; You could have so much content it's not even funny. Thousands of citadels, attack one and see what happens. Oh wait, you can't win that so you tuck your tail between your legs instead. 
---
Yes look at you bragging that you can blob any small group. Yet we still kick the shit out of you because the low IQ mouth breathers always end up in major coalitions. You get farmed and mocked regardless of how much you brag about being able to replace losses spending hours grinding shitty pve. You keep farming rocks. We'll keep farming you.
---
&gt; No, you are delusional. You think that with less targets in space people would fight more lol. :D 
---
Nope. Again more pvp groups will be out roaming if krabs aren't so safe. And they'll fight each other.
---
&gt;CCP allowed us the option built them as much as CCP gave you the option to destroy them.  
---
&gt;What CCP didn't do is: Sent us build Titans, Supers, Carriers, Citadels, Cynojammers, Jump Bridges, 200 people willing to defend the space, organization.  
---
&gt;So, how can you, in a good conscious, claim that CCP handed all of that too us and how can you claim that you can't do anything against that?
---
Okay so if CCP put a mechanic allowing wormholers to DD out of wormholes into your Rorqual fleets and blow them up...will you be okay with that? We'd build them and we live in wormholes. So no problem?
---
&gt;because that isn't even enough for 2 supers. That's why you can't and that's why you won't have a chance against alliances unless you grow a pair and put those assets on the line. But as I said earlier, you won't, cause losing that isk would mean you have to earn it back somehow and that would be something you dislike.  
---
&gt;I understand that, but that doesn't mean the system is rigged against you, because it isn't.  
---
&gt;You just can't compete with a major alliance without having excessive ammount of ISK. Since you don't, ofc you can't compete with them on your own. But that's something you can change. You don't like to change that cause that would mean blobs? Well, fine.  
---
&gt;Just that "I don't have the option because I dislike the options I have" is not a valid argument. As I said, burn those advantages down and you are left with local. If the prey only has the local, the prey is severely disadvantaged.
---
You've never put anything on the line.  Nobody takes you seriously. 
---
Well yes, when you provide multiple indicators then that does mean you have stronger evidence. That's pretty much how it works.
---
20 minutes, not 10.
---
You have to go through both shield and armor, with a notification for both, to RF it.
---
13 year old player just got given the opportunity to join a good alliance!
---
Your internet plan allowance...
---
That would be far too sensible! u/ccp_falcon
---
&gt;You are free to inderdict and bubblefuck these hyper-obvious routes before a timer, nitwit.
---
Except they nerfed being able to do that as well.
---
Previously bubbled ships could not take the gate.  Now they can.
---
The new Jumpbridges are an almost straight upgrade over the old ones, nerfing previous methods of disrupting them (RFing requires minimum 20 mins, bubbles don't prevent jumping anymore), and buffing their capabilities at the same time (Cloaking, regional-gate sized, zero travel restrictions).
---
Looks like CCP agree with Olmeca...
---
... that input broadcasting is just "harmless content creation".
---
[http://isboxer.com/wiki/Send\_Next\_Click\_Action](http://isboxer.com/wiki/Send_Next_Click_Action)  
---
Why would you not just use this for character login? Fitting might be more difficult, but leaving yourself open to an easy mistake seems pretty dumb.
---
&gt; Where can I run missions and be left the hell alone? ... I just want to PvE in relative peace.
---
short answer, in a different game
---
long answer, this is eve online and risk vs reward is an inherent part of every aspect of the game. no space is truly safe, and that's what draws the majority of players here
---
if you want to minimize the risk of getting ganked while running missions alone in high-sec (which is really a waste of the potential of eve online tbh - there's a lot of fun to be had doing other stuff), here are some tips:
---
* create a corp just for yourself so you don't have to pay taxes. corps with no structures in space can't be wardec'd anymore  
---
* avoid flying anything flashy or blingy-fitted. that means leave the marauders and faction battleships at home, and do what you can with tech-2 fittings. pirate implant sets (namely crystals and asklepians) can bridge the difference between t2 and faction/deadspace tank fits, and those can't be ship scanned, which is what people do to find out if you're worth ganking  
---
* there are still people who will gank you just for the fun of it. to avoid running into those people, avoid high-population areas. open your star map and go to stars -&gt; statistics -&gt; pilots active in space to see where people are, and go to the places where they aren't. you can use [this tool](https://www.thonky.com/eve-online-guide/find-nearby-agents) to find systems where you can use the agents
---
&gt; edit: come to think of it worst case scenario its character selection I guessis
---
This is it. 
---
&gt; at that point why would he not just use this
---
&gt; Though now you see why it would be oh so tempting and easy with it all set up to just press cloak too.You are actually right though. 
---
I thought mouse and keyboard broadcasting came together. You are actually right if they are separate. Then he was probably cloaking with it too. Still not sure if this meets "unfair advantage" as saving your drones vs. people does. But it is borderline as these are afk campers.
---
I use 7-10 accounts per monitor by merely [client stacking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpiYxq3mpD8). I think windows and client limitations are actually at a good place to impose standards. But too many people depend on third parties for CCP to completely outlaw them I guess.
---
&gt; for hacking and also hunting asteros on the side
---
the astero is the definitive ship for explorer hunting, mostly because it can use drones for dps and its fitting slots for other stuff
---
you've touched on 2 of the reasons, there are many reasons to use isboxer and broadcasting legitimately
---
there are a lot of different ways to do a lot of things, and just because there is another doesn't detract from using broadcasting to do one
---
DREDDIT IS RECRUITING 
---
Found the American HR guy
---
Skill u have always cheated and used hacks so really not surprised they would exploit anything to get a couple of miserable noob kills.
---
I wish I had recorded catching those nyxes or the niddys. Those were about as clear as botting can be. 
---
That said I'm sure somebody would still deny it. 
---
They just love ratting for frankly unfeasible amounts of time, reacting in exactly the same way, in the same time every time.  
---
While it isn't our job to pass verdict on bot or not as we can't ban them, we can still study and kill them. 
---
Yeah it takes time and effort but I'd rather there be less bots. 
---
50k\*
---
The evidence on the server-side is already beyond what is reasonably needed. The correct way to deal with this is to have a program check the timings on say a recall and flag or autoban the account.
---
Players gathering client-side evidence is basically irrelevant, but given the number of broadcasters/bots, when we do find something "weird", we can assume it is a cheater.
---
The only reason this discussion is had is because CCP is utterly useless or unwilling to ban, or both.
---
yeah it be interesting to see something in anom where if your been rating in a ship for a long time. say super carrier. the rats will put in them rats in a drop attempting to actively try to kill you rather then flail uselessly at your shield or armor.
---
pickture them dread dropping a carrier thats been ratting for  hours on end. if the carrier survives they just got a big bounty pay out. if there a bot / just not paying attention they get punished for it.
---
Maybe true but how can we proof he isnt using it for other things, thats something CCP needs to decide
---
I like you "protecting" him but same for everyone, even if he got no benefit.
---
Its the same with other dudes that accidently wrote in chat while inputbroadcasting was on.
---
Not just Mar5y.
---
Maybe there shouldnt get a lifetime ban, but atleast a harsh reminder that inputbroadcasting is not allowed ingame.
---
playing eve together is like living together. being good friends doesn't mean you make good roommates
---
what i do when people i know irl express an interest in eve is i recommend they join horde and if they need help with anything they can hit me up about it, and i might go on a horde fleet with them here or there to hold their hand. but i know, being a 14-year vet with 8 accounts, that i'm not gonna meet a ton of people who are going to be as invested in eve as i am, so i just don't even set the expectation in the first place
---
It also meant that if you got caught you got reimbursed by CCP, so win win for all
---
I love you!!!!! Thanks for that!
---
PGL FC best FC 😂😂😂
---
the other demographic of renters is people who belong to pvp groups that don't have stable pve space. i know a bunch of dudes who have small drone region renter alt corps where they just multibox afk vnis
---
Imagine being in these comms
---
&gt; I don't think it's fair to imply that people with deviant appearances are more likely to have deviant behaviours
---
&gt; In nature, purple/yellow/orange/etc exists as warning colours, typically found on poisonous species of snakes, frogs, etc. The knowledge of this is something that's deeply ingrained in our lizard brains.
---
&gt; I refuse to not believe that people who dye their hair in these colours aren't on some subconscious level signalling something, either way I am going to trust my instincts.
---
​
---
&gt; The classic elite redditor reply. Starts with a third rate "haha I am so smart and and informed, you're dumb haha" uninspired insult, followed up by something that's objectively wrong, which the morons then pile up on with their upboats because reddit is as a platform is the perfect place for idiots to congregate and self-reinforce their beliefs through variying layers of subcommunities. Don't like something someone said? Just downvote it and upvote the least retarded retard giving it a shot, he gets upboats and the bad guy gets downboats, this is irrefuteable proof that the narrative is correct and intact.
---
&gt; Purple, bright blue and dark orange is almost exclusively used as signal colours in nature to signify that you're poisonous. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism
---
&gt; While it's true that bright colours are used to attract mating partners, especially among birds, we're talking about two completely different classes of animals here. What's funny about your world is that you think that because you can find an outlier to a trend, often completely outside of context or relevance, that this alone invalidates the merit of that suggested trend entirely. **This psuedointellectual rhetoric is a major part of what makes reddit an insufferable shitpit of dumb people pretending to be smart;** everything is always relative, tolerance is the only virtue. Anything remotely against these tenets gets brigaded down or moderated.
---
&gt; I didn't want this karma anyway, so go on do your best bois :o)
---
What is it like being terminally retarded?
---
Anything for an old Cultural Initiative bro &lt;3
---
If it was a legitimate accident I hope he shores up his method to ensure it does not happen, I cannot really think of much that cannot be done legally by toggling a mouse click on, but then again most people do not think pressing undock is a massive pain in the ass.
---
if you're new, you won't be able to make enough money to cover the rent, even in cheap systems
---
you might look around for an established renter corp that you could join, or just join one of the newbro-friendly corps in larger alliances - they don't have tremendous activity requirements or anything, you're not gonna be insta purged for not going on every fleet
---
&gt;while we (maybe) skill up for some PvP.
---
​new player fallacy #1 - i can't pvp right now, i need to train more skills first
---
you can pvp *right this second.* new players start out with every skill needed to jump into pvp immediately on character creation now. you won't be amazing at it, which has as much to do with skill points as player skill, but learning is a process, and sucking at something is the first step toward being kinda good at something

You will not make decent income in c2/c3 especially with cap production.      
---
Minerals are cheap and most of the producers are people who mine - just to sell the minerals at bit closer to jita prices (as a capital hull)   
---
In a WH you can do a PI farm that have decent income recently - and this fits into your planed SP farm.        
---
Start 10-20 alpha accounts and start skilling them to 3x 5mil sp - when they are baked - using 1 plex train them into PI/sp farm. 
---
Well that doesn't help to narrow it down

it's a lot of convenience, lots of legit reasons (like for suicide ganking, for example, where you're undocking 20 accounts at a time and setting up your UI)

It's good to see kids can be educated in important life lessons in a harmless arena like a video game.
---
Maybe, but a lot of the evidence presented on here is pretty flimsy.
---
It makes me question if the botting really is that bad (there is some, of that there is no doubt) or are people whining bitches and/or trying to push an agenda?
---
Not that it makes a shit of difference but when the sub is full of such posts there's not much else to think or talk about. 
---
Sure it can be done really fast, but why would someone mining alone in a guarded system care about alt tabbing and assigning drones at warp speed everytime?  I understand there are a lot of legitmate ones out there, but cmon.  I could care less if it is a goon.  
---
exciting :-|
---
Depends on the groups you’re poking. Everyone in the game use rorqs and jump bridges but not everyone has a super umbrella. There is also plenty of pets living around the main alliances that get protection against invasion but no help on a daily basis. If you do it well you can create conditions where you are small but set up and ready while the enemy is big on paper but has to rush into you. The big advantage of hitting jump bridges and rorqs is that you threaten something immediately (a rorq will die, a jump bridge will be disabled for a while after reinforcement and can often be killed the same day). They are generally better content drivers than entosis (entosising valuable ihubs takes forever because they have high adm and people can just ignore you because you have to come back two days later to actually disturb anything and you can’t easily troll high adm systems) or reinforcing citadels (because they are often tz tanked and just losing shields has no consequence, so you spend half an hour just to maybe have to form up again and fight the next day.
---
Aim for a C5 ratting wormhole. Safer (as long as you have holes control) and much more profitable.
---
accident or not, punishment should still be handed down, you don't accidentally kill someone with your car and get away scott free. 
---
"enter"?
---
Proof please!
---
I'd honestly be surprised if the Goon Wiki doesn't have a skilplan for Titans at this stage.
---
He also used it to broadcast into chat, not only logging in. So there you go you have "inductive evidence" 
---
PGL fleets and comms are rarely boring.
---
this is /r/eve what do you think
---
Yep I am one of the ones who ticked the box, never saw the rig warning for the Legion.
---
Where did I deny that? I said he forgot the program he was legally using on, which resulted him accidentally sending messages in chat. Like do I need to repeat my every word to you for you to stop saying stupid things?
---
It was an accident. It did not give him "unfair advantage", which is CCP criterion for bans. Which is why he is not banned btw.
---
Yep the majority of people who do this because its easily available and you have all sorts of eve lawyers telling them why its a grey area.
---
Nah, that would be characters. There are about 12-14k goons and the other 4-6k would be Bastion and TNT in addition to maybe some others, though Init should be mostly in Fountain.
---
    should I submit a daily ticket?
---
Yes
---
So if those input related items are so minor maybe totally ban broadsiding. 
---
Imagine adding snide "lol u dumb" on quoted posts you don't agree with, but with zero content explaining why and actually believe that you appear clever, because you're so far up on the dunning kruger scale that you believe your perception is the default point for right and wrong.
---
Imagine stalking randos on the internet and rely on upboats from randos on the internet to feel worthwhile, and believing that preaching to the virtual choir has any significance.
---
I didn't even think of that. I'm building a new computer soon and I'll be able to run up to 12 accounts though my goal is 6 or so plex'd accounts. The wormhole I'm going to look for I plan to have a c4 or c5 static . Wh living I expect is prolly 6+ months out for me as it is.
---
I don't think you understand how server ticks work. Also 1 second is enough to send a hotkey command to 4-5 clients if you have it set up right. On the other side it looks like it happens instantly because the server updates every 1 second. 
---
That's what I'm looking at a c2 or c3 with a c4 or 5 static and do a domi tinker setup of some sort or snakes.
---
Go away.
---
Yea, we all know you are a eula warrior and gotten banned multiple times for things that "are not against the eula".
---
Fake News! 
---
No one would honestly believe this propaganda that ha been design with the intent to nerf goons. Its unfair how these hardworking null sec residents are constantly chastised within reddit.
---
they usually field more than that just for a RvB small frigate roam, tbh.  
---
always wave in local for [BBC] o/
---
Oh here is comes. People. moaning about free shit they're not getting. 
---
I fuvking hate this community some times. 
---
They got a sick itty mark V kill though
---
Wormholes with less incentive to be there. At least in a frig hole you can set uo structures and live out of there. In frig only space you couldnt even bring in a raitaru to base out of it would just be empty. 
---
By all means keep trying to get input broadcasters and botters banned, I hate them too. I love roaming and bots who auto-warp when I enter local are the absolute bane of my existance.
---
But "Most multiboxers in Delve are smarter now" ????  
---
How can anyone take you seriously when you just sling wild accusations around like that? 
---
Sounds fishy. I doubt this is the whole story. 
---

ugh nothing

---
Isn't that what Thera is?
---
What is broadcast inputting? 
---
If you are at the eve meetup in London you can suck my dick in the toilets if you want xxxx. Maybe I can inputbroad cast into you somehow. Mmmmm
---
It's called alt tab and hotkeys for drone launch you can alt tab and launce 40 toons drones in 10 seconds
---
Sorry I must be getting very forgetful in my old age, could you point out where I said I had a solution? 
---
If CCP verified some of these claims, it would probably be the case that 9/10 it is indeed a broadcaster/bot. But CCP refuses to automate even a little bit, so checking this takes time and therefore will not happen until the bitching reaches some hidden threshold.
---
hah
---
that's beside the issue, which is that you're 100% wrong here.
---
at least read up on the issue before shitposting
---
just read the eula, you don't have to take my word for it moron
---
&gt;Input Broadcasting and Input Multiplexing of actions with consequences in the EVE universe, are prohibited and will be policed in the same manner as Input Automation. 
---
Why are you using unfair advantage in quotes when it is "consequences" in the post you linked? 
---
Stop trying to spin it so hard. It's exactly the same except ccp hasn't yet decided what to with the goons multiboxers. 
---
There are a lot of areas in the game where subcaps reign supreme and capitals are rarely, if ever, used. 
---
years of quafe abuse...
---
1 click 1 action for anything that has impact on the game world. logging in 100 characters has an impact on the game world and thus shouldn't be input broadcasted. 
---
I mean there is a feature ingame called squad warping?
---
Yup. Well baited :) GG Titan and Nyx. Type to farm for another fortnight and get some more. 
---
pepe hands.

GREAT, TELL THEM ALL OUR SECREST NEWB.  THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS!!!!

---
maybe instead of eating shit LZHX should've ate some beans
---
its entirely possible, just because everyone isn't the same level of casual scrub as you doesn't mean people aren't able to perform precision repetitive tasks, its not like someone fielding 10 rorqs wouldn't have had multiple opportunities to practice spamming through his accounts to recall drones. 
---
Supers/Titans are so cheap these days, few hours of C5 ratting and you'll have a new one.
---
Sad
---
More Querious than Fountain for actual INIT. Fountain is mostly renters.
---
People start posting evidence about Goons input broadcasting and suddenly we’re back to mar5hy threads. 
---

More cookie cutter snide shit, u go boi
---
Yes, but there's no feature called squad drone launching!
---
&gt; then game will be too good 
---
And the problem with that is...?!?!
---
So you answered your question and asked it anyway. 
---
I knew it reminded me of something!
---
Could you please post an AAR/BR /u/JC_D3NT ? Thank you :)
---
No
---
So for you, there is a difference between a goons and a non-goons who use input broadcasting ? You sir, are a deepshit.
---
Botting, RMT, input broadcasting or any other way who give any player an advantage from the other using something against the EULA is just someone who deserve a ban. So Gaara Sniper deserved a ban, Marshy deserved a ban, any other illegal shit who play this game deserve a ban and if you think their alliance they are working with should be the high priority, then you are retarded and should take a time you think about your real conviction : a narrative to push or a game issue ?
---
Lazy people are lazy eh? 
---
Automated input is forbidden regarding the EULA. Now think for yourself, did you automated your input?
---
You can nitpick here and say that certain automated inputs are not forbidden but they are out of game so to say. Character creation, starting your clients and such things are ok afaik but automating ingame actions is not ok.  
---
Clearly not allowed.
---
This guy may or may not be input broadcasting, but what is shown in the video is definitely NOT input broadcasting. He launches 1-2 sets of drones per server tick - it takes him over 10 seconds to launch the drones on all his rorquals. Input broadcasting would launch every single drone in the exact same tick. OP then tries to make it look like he recalls them all at once by hiding them on his overview???

shit thread lock and ban
---
Why delete the thread from someone who was there with an AAR and move it to the goon karmawhore one....
---
Sometimes local breaks - generally this either means that local is entirely empty (doesn't even contain you), or displays only part of the people that should be there (particularily obvious when your alts have widely different local).
---
These problems generally extend to other chat channels as well, randomly rendering fleet, alliance, corp and/or player-owned chats unusable.

Yeah, there were several indicators that it was bait, but we figured we'd chance it anyway. We've killed plenty of shit before, we'll replace them and continue to drop on stuff. It's all part of the game.
---
My Super nearly got out, I was like 30km from a single Devo pointing me, before he started catching up to me. :/
---
Mistakes were made, gg, nice trap. Until next time. :)

Horde Trash Tier FC here, this dunk was proudly brought to you by the team that killed 300 TAPI caps and ended a campaign. We got word Lazerhawks had been reffing stuff with solo Nyxes so Panfam formed up dreads + ssf carriers with tackle and midded. We got word Lazerhawks were using leshaks for the ref so Prothean alliance formed pico HAW dreads with bhaal and vindi support and wiped their fleet. Lazerhawks then escalated with 1 avatar + 3 nyxes.
---
We logged in and bridged in when tackle was confirmed and primaried the avatar with one nyx getting out before we got on grid. Avatar was tanky boi so while we were killing him two of the nyxes managed to burn 70-100km away from the cap ball. We finally killed the avatar and melted the nyx 20km off then killed the last 2 nyxes which we were holding hic scrammed. All dreads and faxes were out of the first siege cycle. Thanks to Prothean Alliance for being absolute legends, NCPL for being bros and LZHX for being ballers.

Hey Vix, why do you never use your supers for anything? You left your mate in a Wyvern to die not 2 weeks ago.
---
are you gonna get another super?
---
fixed
---
WTB cyno'ing out advice. 
---
Go eat some frozen burgers Judy
---
I presume the issue is the fact that a the rigs won't be destroyed if fitted in aT3C, but the message is saying the contrary
---
Gotta learn from Vix you big noob.
---
When you start dropping unsupported supers consistently someone will take them away. GG
---
positive.  my latest encounter with customer support took about 2 weeks to get a response, this was back in October.  I think I asked them to please delete everything in my inventory because I had a seriously ridiculous amount of assets spread over 100s of systems. in the end of course they claimed they couldnt do it, which I don't believe but whatever I know fighting them is useless. 
---
Just a minor correction, Prothean dropped 3 capgun dreads supported with 2 vindicators at point blank on us, I think we would've tanked HAWs, but the capguns roasted us.
---
Subcaps will start to close the distance with caps only when the tech is advanced far enough, that TiDi gets diminished. In theory, as well as real life, a group of fast hitting, fast moving warships can get the drop on a single, big one. Especially when you can leave the battlefield very fast (aka EVE warp off) or relocate your group of small ships (warp around). If a subcap group could warp in, launch missiles/fire guns and warp off/around again in the time it takes for a dread/Titan to lock them, they would actually be impervious to their fire. Same thing with carriers, you just warp off before the fighters get in range to attack you and reposition on the other side of the grid, making the fighters run around without ever managing to hit. That kind of kiting tactics works extremely well in small gang fights (and in many other games, SC2 comes to mind), but TiDi makes ships fail to lock/align/warp, guns fail to fire/malfunction. In this case, having a single ship to handle becomes much easier that 50. So the only real solution is better coding for the game and better equipment for the servers.
---
More null space??? Are you serious? You want more space for space-renting, botting corporations? Half of null is nigh empty except for the botting carriers/supers/rorqs, which run on scripts that make them impossible to catch. No thanks, that is not what we need atm.
---
Exploration is a pretty good source of income with a low entry barrier.
---
u still suck but thank u shelby
---
I was thinking maybe we should blue one side of the game and then just go live in the home region until the server's die.
---
wait they dropped capgun dreads on leshaks, or did they drop them anticipating an escalation
---
ahahahah ExRo Power! Lazerhawks(Yankies) go home! ;)

idk sounds boring

Whenever I see people with their panties in a wad about people looking at their post history, I can't help but wonder *why*.  Worried that people are going to see through your concern trolling if you forget you're posting (or not posting) from your alt account someday?

Vindi webs allow cap gun tracking
---
That is a fucking brilliant idea! Rats don't trigger local, so they would be able to drop on scripted bots with impunity. Totally approve of idea!

this, people often take that as a criticism due to general russians reputation as turbokrabs but United Fleet is the most reliable backbone of calmil in the wz since the bloc left, as someone who was in hecon for quite a while it was pretty infuriating watching them filling the fleets and not get a single mention from observers (while we did having half the nerds in fleet/important jobs)
---
Explain? I called out this guy for stalking post histories and making low effort one liners. The original guy posted something about religion which the guy I am talking to quoted completely out of context to farm easy karma, as redditors very often are enlightened atheists which are way too smart and capable of independent thought to believe such fairy tales xD
---
He then continues to do the exact same thing, somehow believing that proves him right.
---
And no I am not even religious, but it's hilarious to see that a lot of you guys are displaying the exact same behaviours as the subsets of people you mock while patting each other on the back over it.

A dual rep astero tanks about 110-120 dps so this will chew away at them. Their only offense/defense is drones so you will need to defang them if they are on the ball - just make sure you keep them in range and select ammo types appropriately if you are being kited.
---
If you find an explorer at a site already/have everything pre-scanned down I would get to a safe out of D-scan and refit your probe launcher to a 3rd Neutron blaster and the analyzer to a stasis webifier - this should give you no problems in your murderous endeavours.

The point I am trying to make here is that whatever that guy has written somewhere on a topic completely unrelated to the post he made here has, in principle, zero relevance to the merit of this post. But in stead you want to ignore what's being said, put people into different categories and award cool kid points accordingly to which group someone is put in, because fuck evolving mentally past high school and actually contending with the issues at hand in stead of playing virtual social games for karma.

This is why I'm in Horde

Titan / Super pilot here. RIP :) Oh well, fun to drop shit, but sometimes it get's lost. Time to get some more. Second super loss and first titan loss in the b0t campaign but still isk positive so it's fine :D

The result is; we understand and accept the fact that we failed on both fronts.

I’d tap that ! Well my main would

you've basically just described petes fyi

You should stick to WH space just like you tell nullsecers to stick to nullsec!

&gt; considering the chain jumping required to accrue that amount.

you mean two jumps

i know this is beating a dead horse,   but what about the case where Mar5y send "yea they use Asics nowadays" containing a typo across ALL his characters and multiple chats at the same time?

 i mean yea its not lighting a cyno or dropping bombs or pulling drones,

but its fairly concrete evidence of that person using imput broadcasting software

again dead horses and all, whats the stance of CCP on that?

Seeing as he does not live in the US (all I am saying so as to not risk a ban), there is nothing wrong with what time he posted.

It's Amamake. And not so much anymore. Tama is the preferred Capital entry for Caps now days.
---
Gaara was banned for RMT, not for input boradcasting.
---
Mar5hy was not banned after CCP lookit into the case.
---
Goons still complaining about it, if you guys don't like how CCP is handling the rules, leave for another game and stop spamming reddit with your shit.

they actually seem pretty delayed between them all to me

there is 1 dude that would deal with this, we have like 50k dudes, can you understand why it was sed not to report them?

Nice that alliance will do more than ratting, mining and gate camping !

that awkward moment when you a pick a fight with someone who can drop more revs than you have fleet members.
---
Its because you are doing the exact thing you seem to bitch about people doing you fucking moron.

are they bot?
---
Probably not the first to ask, but if you NEED caps to destroy cits, what happens in hs/wh?
---
ISboxer was around and not banned for a long time. people learned about it before it was banned because there were popular players like replicant who had 40+ clients and were asked about often.

knowing how do do something bad != you are doing something bad.

Eh, as a general attitude I'd rather have some fun and die then jerk off to killmarks I got dropping on solo roamers in delve in perfect safety.

Solo dropping and alphaing ratting carriers in B0T staging is some of the most fun I've had.

If the question arises the answer is most often NO.

I just moved cross country, so I haven't been involved in any fleets while I get unpacked and work situated. But as of today, I am back in the saddle.
---
You’re a cuck. 
---
&gt; No these things are gameplay mechanics. I get that you farmed them and built them, but CCP put these modifications into the game. If CCP gave wormhole small gang crews the ability to DD from wormhole space into your Rorquals what then? Would you say "well they built that titan in the wormhole so they earned it." Of course not. You'd point out how the GAMEPLAY MECHANIC is fucked.
---
that's a dumb argument. A DD from out of nowhere would be OP AF, but it's not like supers drop put of nowhere onto your small gang. It's not like you can't prepare for that. If you think umbrellas are OP, then that's a totally different conversation to be had (I too think supers are OP. I think HAW fits on titans are OP). What does that have to do with local though?
---
If you think the umbrella is Overpowered, then we should talk about nerfing that. 
---
If Supers and Titans could kill you from 1DQ when you enter 1Smeb, then sure, I would agree that's an equivalent example. They just can't. 
---
&gt;CCP isn't removing capitals or citadels.
---
Yes, because there is no need for that. Players can. 
---
&gt;Okay then answer this. Why not make all ships 1 isk? If cheap ships directly means more destruction which is good, just make every ship 1 isk. Please answer this. 
---
Because then mining would be a pointless exercise. PvP would also be pointless. Stuff needs to have meaning/value else it's not interesting. 
---
&gt;Citation needed.
---
Check MER
---
&gt;If krabs are easier to kill....and more pvpers start roaming to kill them...do you think it's more or less likely of a chance that pvp groups will roam into each other? Answer this.
---
Why do you need to have krabs being easier to kill for that? There are plenty of roaming gangs already. Somehow, they don't meet all that often. Reason? Answer this. 
---
&gt;Yes you will find targets. They'll simply be those pvpers instead of krabs. More small gang fighting small gang.
---
I wish this would be true. It's just far from reality because you can have plenty of content if you want it even without PvE'ers involved, right now. However, especially the small gangs opt out of that. They don't want it. What makes you think they want to fight against other roaming gangs more? 
---
Where is your evidence for that? I have data from the MER that suggest that everything you say is wrong. I have my own experience which also makes me think you are wrong. Should I trust in your magical leap of faith that, without local, PvP'ers around new Eden will finally want fights they might not win 100%? Because I don't and none of your opinions will change my believes. 
---
&gt;Yes look at you bragging that you can blob any small group. Yet we still kick the shit out of you because the low IQ mouth breathers always end up in major coalitions. You get farmed and mocked regardless of how much you brag about being able to replace losses spending hours grinding shitty pve.
---
So we get farmed regardless of our huge numbers, regardless of our capital umbrellas, regardless of alliance infrastructure like Jump Bridges, Cyno beacons, citadels etc. etc.? 
---
Yes, I agree! Noone is ever invulnerable unless docked and we are not an exception. I wholeheartedly agree. I also consider this a good thing btw. :)
---
&gt;Nope. Again more pvp groups will be out roaming if krabs aren't so safe. And they'll fight each other.
---
Then why don't they do it now? Because the evil krabs with their locals discourage them to do so? :D The reality is: krab-Ganking is the most proliferated form of PVP in Null. That's why you need more krabs out there, not less. 
---
Krabs are content generators and you don't want less of them, you want more. Why? Because PvP'ers refuse to BE content. They don't want fights one qual footings and they will go above and beyond to avoid any fight they might not win. It's so deeply rooted in EvE PvP that you can't get rid. 
---
&gt;okay so if CCP put a mechanic allowing wormholers to DD out of wormholes into your Rorqual fleets and blow them up...will you be okay with that? We'd build them and we live in wormholes. So no problem?
---
If I would have a fair warning for it and a way to avoid that, sure. If CCP thinks it's a good idea and it proves to be a benefit for the game, I very much would. I don't have to like it, but if it makes eve a better game, go ahead. 
---
&gt;You've never put anything on the line. Nobody takes you seriously.
---
That doesn't even matter one bit cause noone except us two is reading this conversation anyway, and I couldn't care less about your opinion, the same way you don't care about my opinion. 
---
I will try to remember for next time lmao
---
PH is a newbie alliance and does not have a supercapital force! (/s)
---
Yeah but why would your enemy complain about the movement of nonexistent forces?
---
This is quite easy, code is repetitive.        
---
So if 3h after DT they come to specific location , it is huge chance that if undisturbed - 3h after DT next day they will also show up in the same spot. 
---
My first LOL of the day.  Thanks.
---
I talked to a 12-year-old in there once [it’s a long time ago] and I asked him to get his mother on the computer.
---
I told her not to let her kid play this because it’s not the place for it. The EVE demographic is mostly adults and the nature of the place is rather unforgiving.
---
I’ve seen a [then] 7-year-old engage in PvP, but that was strictly under parental supervision. That father was the account holder. He would not have his kid do that by herself. There are too many layers that children simply can’t understand at their pristine age. It’s not a game for kids.
---
I don’t agree that’s what we should be doing in there, and I didn’t take advantage of the kid although he was [of course] very naive, but it’s the kind of place it is. I don’t want it to change. I don’t need EVE to become a bouncy castle where all the walls are soft and there no loud noises.
---
It seems like you have some problems with reading comprehension, so I'll lay it out for you;
---
1. The person I replied to pulls out a completely unrelated post from the OPs post history to farm karma and show he's one of the good guys™
---
2. I ask the person if he often does that.  
---
3. He pulls something from my post history, essentually doing the same "lol u dumb" thing over again.
---
4. I reply to a shitpost with a shitpost, but at least with some motivations explained and content that challenges why he does this.
---
5. He does the same thing for the third time, so I reply with a sub effort shitpost to match.
---
6. You chime in, I explain.
---
7. You reply "haha no u are doing it u dumb", this is where we are now, please point out to me how this relates to anything tangible in the chain of events here.
---
Read before shitposting? Wtf happened since 2018?
---
Just because theres no better alternatively at hand doesn't mean something cant be shit
---
It's like 8 groups of 2-3 rorquals and the reason they are synced is because of server ticks. If he launches 3 rorquals worth of drones on his end in 1 second they all update on your client on the next server tick. Really not hard to do at all.
---
Add a bonused TP and remote tracking enhancers for good measure.
---
Just that its 3am
---
Been watching this guy for a while. it's one dude trust me. 
---
Ask your owners, they propably have some people in australia.
---
You know full well that's not what he means...
---
Wtf are lazerhawks not living in wormholes any more? I'm so out of the loop with eve
---
Haha. It’s as crazy as thinking that kids joining the United States military were born after sept 11th 2001. 
---
oof
---
No, not really. I mean what does he mean, when you don’t participate as part of the north blue donut or south blue donut you’re bound to lose your supers eventually? Well, yeah. 
---
You’ve got two choices, join a big null bloc and ensure you can always win by having a super fleet behind you, or you can tool around in them and accept there is always going to be a bigger fish that can out fleet you, support ships or not.

---
The whole point of jump fatigue was to try and stop nullsec becoming supercaps online (I'll let you debate the success of that one), presently, Supers and Titans cannot ... Another reason these don't have fatigue is because fozziesov mechanics favour the attacker (although I'm in the Imperium I haven't always been and I've been on both sides of the fight many times) so something needs to level the playing field a bit ... It also allows the smaller alliance out there to compete with the bigger ones who consistently shit on them (if you want to see smaller fleets taking out bigger ones search YouTube for INIT. bombing the shit out of larger hostile fleets, there are loads of them 😀)
---
That would require math, no thanks ccp round.

---
Whats wrong with that? I started playing eve when i was 14.. 
---
So I appreciate the info that I will defiantly use later I'm wondering where my focus should be now. Currently I can run 10/10 deds as well as escalations using a snake and vni or should I focus on mining with a booster and 2 miners? I'm currently based in null so I've got options just not sure what I should focus for the best isk flow when I'm on. I can day trip whs also if any are nearby. Been also wondering if I should keep the snake/vni combo or move to dual tinker domi's
---
I get your point but you need to support your supers with subs that complement them, don't just use any old doctrine then drop your supers, if you plan on escalating, plan ahead for that. All he's saying is you could have had a good brawl. Yeah your gonna lose the supers if you drop them in range of us, but if you plan ahead for that it could have been a even more awesome brawl for both sides.
---
Oh, I am not talking about accidentally setting that up. What I mean is - there is no technical way to have proper anti-cheat that will both cover cases of malicious use of common tools and not punish players who don't do malicious things. With popular games that have millions of players it's actually easier to provide anti-cheat. One, with big enough player population tool that is used to cheat and noticeable will have a lot of users, making it easy to find, set up anti-cheat around it and punish players who used that tool. Two, most of these games require cheating tool to read game state directly, which makes it interact with game client process and therefore makes it much easier to detect, for EVE all that's neded is just simple input automation triggered manually - just due to gameplay difference. Three, most of these popular competetive new games are either significantly newer or got significant rewrites during their lifetime, often focusing on security a lot. From what I've heard about EVE client so far (and seen from game client doing weird stuff in heavy tidi) I don't really believe EVE was built around security or even reliability first. Four, if you have several dozens of people working on their own cheat tools, their testing and personal use of said tools is irrelevant margin, unless they decide to sell them to others.
---
So, given that there will be people that will cheat, cheaters will use whatever best they can use without getting detected, and the "I'll just make my own custom cheat" margin in EVE has a risk to not be that marginal (back when input broadcasting was kind of legal, it took one person with bunch of alts to bomb entire battleship fleet), I just can't imagine any anti-cheat to just work. You either make it to block specific cheating tools/apps that are used (doesn't affect anyone capable of making any kind of custom cheat tool - even autohotkey script would likely be enough), you make it to block certain behaviors that are used for cheating (I've already given examples of what can easily be used for cheating without being intended for that, and blank block on some would make quite a bit of people unable to login due to other circumstances), or go back to square one and have to manually verify every case without blocking it in first place, which makes building anti-cheat solution redundant. What reason would CCP then have to add any kind of anti-cheat? Remember, anti-cheat is still just a computer program, it can't magically "ban cheats" or "enforce legitimate gameplay", it can do only what exactly it was programmed for.
---
I just checked the thing about Logitech panel and Logitech Gaming Software has - for keyboards at least - builtin ability to set up key sequences or full on macros directly there. So it is enough for cheater to have easy "1 key - multiple actions to 1 client" that way, and - if you add window switch shortcut (like alt-tab) you can even make it "1 key - multiple actions to multiple clients". And there's Razer, allowing the ability to preset macros directly in keyboard/mouse memory chip, and having those macros work even without having software to set it up installed.
---
I'm not arguing it's easy or even possible to cheat by accident without using dedicated tools, that is irrelevant since there's no way to find out what the intention is, and you shouldn't at any point make any assumptions about good will or competence (always assume malicious users are competent, and regular users are incompetent). What I do argue for is that - given how EVE works and what anti-cheats can reliably detect - it is impossible to have anti-cheat that will both cover input automation as a whole and allow everyone legitimately playing the game now to keep playing as they used to (read: without buying second PC so they can still rat/mine/wait for ops without their work triggering anti-cheat - talking to you Riot and Valve "you can't have debugger running" anti-cheat systems). So, CCP could either develop a tool that solves the issue of script kiddies trying to use existing tools and nothing else (including any semi-serious automation approach), a tool that would make the game unplayable to at least about third of people I fly or used to fly with, or just keep doing what they're doing and manually verify reports.
---
Same reason as when you hit the undock button with a limited engagement and you get a message that you won't be able to dock back, even though limited engagement alone never prevented docking.
---
When even /u/globbyrebornASS calls out your trash posting you might want to lay off the coolaid for a week or two lmao.
---
Yup, squizz can do it all, sure CCP could implement something interesting for us. 
---
This one gets it
---
Do t2 production, if you are in fountain you are probably in INIT, I would assume they have a logistics service?  I don't know if ITL covers your regions.. but just buy the raw goo and ship it down and build ships for your alliance.. generally speaking t2 ships have very nice profit margins. 
---
You could say it that way. Or you could say that putting things at risk means they die sometimes. 
---
The issue is - from game client perspective there is no difference between that, and setting up one-button macro that does that while also alt-tabbing through active windows in order. Effectively, trying to change current definition of broadcasting towards "ban anything that allows software generated key codes to be sent to client" would somehow handle these cases. If there was any simple solution for that problem, I bet CCP would use it long time ago.
---
classic autz feed
---
Yea, it’s weird but usually solutions come from first recognising and then discussing problems. Apparently this guy doesn’t logic. 
---
They signed a contract &gt; 12 months apparently.
---
Your camping of the drone regions drove me, and many others, to go join one of those blue donuts. 
---
I think a better approach to this (if it were to be done) would be to have "anomalies" randomly affect certain areas of null-sec. There could be different classes of anomaly that determine which ship sizes are allowed (Frigs, Cruiser and below, Battleship and below, etc), they could last for varying lengths of time (12h, 24h, 36h, etc) and could affect anything from a few systems, a constellation or even a full region.  
---
Nothing groundbreaking but it might spice things up somewhat.
---
it took the guy 10 seconds to launch all drones. alt+tab, click+drag from drone bay into space, repeat, 28 times. the apm is more than possible. He could be broadcasting and delaying inputs per client but theres not any reliable evidence that he is doing that instead of just doing it manually. 
---
i hate botters enough that im on this sub in the first place because im considering getting back in only for bot hunting, and even i woudlnt start a vendetta against this guy. 
---
Presumibly because messing with the code will give citadels the ability to take gates or some other legacy code fuckery. Tick the box and stop badposting &lt;3
---
&gt; morally entitled to use 0.0 as a playground whenever they like
---
I'm curious what the other option is here? 
---
Imagine your job interview after having CCP on your resume. Were you responsible for boot.ini? Was rorq's your idea? Go thru this flow chart and show us how you would round numbers. Were they weekly contest to see how ugly of a skin someone could make and actually have someone buy it?
---

Not gonna lie, that makes me moist. 
---
Laughing all the way to the bank selling skins.
---
An moron? 
---
I don’t think you appreciate the size of the little guys. You know all the lazerhawks losses? That was literally everyone online, 5-6 dudes, already dual or triple boxing. I was quad boxing myself (Utama, Visteen, Capisun, Titan Escalation if you doubt it).
---
The idea that we have numbers available to form a supporting sub fleet is laughable. Even then, it wouldn’t make a difference in that situation. 
---
If you’re the little guy you’re dead if you’re caught, that’s just the way it is. Not saying I have a problem with it; we’re aware of it and accept those risks every time we drop. 
---
It’s not possible or practical for us to have any supports on drops. 
---
too obvious, my dude
---
Well glacial pace would feel like a speed runner for CCP.
---
Yeah that's a big one, don't let yourself get talked into not enjoying the game, it's not perfect but it's not crashing and burning either.
---
lmao. why is anyone still in goons at this point 
---
imagine obsessing over a video game you hate for literal years
---
After twice I don't send in reports anymore. Not worth my time. There are a few things in game that I sent my first report over a year ago. Then resent it in about 6 months ago. Not going to do scheduling and prioritizing for CCP.
---
Tbh CCP should ban the usage of certain apps just because it has the option of doing illegal things with it. Don't want to get banned, use something that is 100% legal. 
---
it was better when you were shadowbanned 
---
just use ur brain
---
imagine getting personal because some guy called you out on a cringey post you made on an internet forum
---
he's unable, he think it's epic for the win to post this kind of stuff, it's like edgy humor to him
---
Well bots are certain apps......
---
Not daily but happens. I don't send in reports anymore. 
---
hearing "kool-aid" from the people who drink memes so hard that they somehow think that beating someone at a video game is bad is kinda weird to hear honestly
---
Yup. Glad we could affect an alliance with thousands of members to feel like they had to blue up with the entire north because of literally one dude. I solo ran the entire camping campaign. 
---
Ask yourself, did you *really* need to blue people though? With the tiniest amount of competence you could easily destroy us, but simply bluing people is the easiest option. 
---
If I was you I’d aim for a c3 WH with a null (preferable) or lowsec static. You can make a ton of isk in a c3 without spending over 1b, and unless you majorly fuckup then you’re p much 100% safe. You’ll get regular connections if you want to roam WHs or get back to highsec, these are easily rolled if you want to rat in peace. 
---
Then use your null stat to roam for pvp, or run anoms / DEDs if you want more isk. 
---
Train a few of your characters into Oracles and kill the existing POCOs, replace with your own and make an extra couple bil (semi) passively. 
---
It was Nate actually
---
Unload your injectors now before the market crashes, if it's not already in motion.
---
just saying you may want to rethink the accusations of cringe given, well, the half a decade or more
---
I don't get it, can you explain that joke?
---
My favorite is 2 of my accounts in a system and one will show 2 in local and the other one just show himself and not the other.
---
i need more than this to get off
---
timers work + or - 2 hours in a 4 hour window on stuctures
---
It's when someone uses an application that allows you to make one click happen on other clients at the same time.
---
For example, if you're running 5x clients, rather than clicking 5 different times, you have one 'main' client and 4x 'slave' clients that follow exactly what your 'main' client does.
---
Heck, I just saw someone ice mining in 20+ skiffs with one of those programs the other day. Didn't realize CCP now has it against the EULA. 
---
I have a vindicator and an empty hull, *hint hint*
---
Wait, so the NPCs would then mine the ochre and mercoxit? Good idea; ship it immediately.

11:34:53	Combat	6514 from Guardian Angels Barachael - Wrecks
---
was sitting at 0 on my mtu insted or orbeting "o look a bs spawn" then yeah i died 5s later 
---
ya i mean just cause you've gotten more cringey over time doesn't mean i have to redefine you to supercringe
---
i've listened to you on that podcast, sheesh
---
I mean where is gigx now
---
&gt; and older cracked versions [ie the ones people mostly use] have it enabled by default 
---
Sorry, you're making shit up here by saying most people use a cracked version of ISBoxer. Based on my numbers, which are on the other hand not just made up, most people are honest and pay for things of use to them. Maybe in your corp of toddlers they don't get enough allowance from mom and dad, but most people seem to understand the value of someone else's work... (The old cracked version also has compatibility issues that would prevent "most people" from using it.)
---
**ISBoxer does have broadcasting disabled by default for EVE, for several years now.** Since basically the day they announced the rule changes. That's not a false premise.
---
Nope, we just find it funny that we have such a legendary status that evicting a hole with hundreds of people is held up as a historical eve moment. 
---
peewee herman wants his bit back

Don't high end angel rats do EM damage?
---
In l4s for angels there are some quirky npcs that do em damage. 
---
If someone in null wants easy kills they have easier way - just set up a gatecamp and wait for people coming to their space. Heck, if I was after farming easy kills I'd just join Horde and camp BWF-ZZ all the time.
---
But there's also quality of kills, and for me it means kills that took effort to outsmart or otherwise outplay the target (relatively speaking, sometimes it means just waiting for target to do something dumb) and killing ships that are somewhat expected to die by their owner is not so fun. And for that part (from my perspective) of hunting down people that try their best not to lose their ship local is a tool for both sides - giving everyone a chance to react and try to end it their way. Any smart and well prepared pve entity will have cloaked eyes placed in every system and someone on signature duty all the time, not having local actually helps this kind of groups more than players who target them.
---
&gt;every account that held Omega clone status as of the start of daily downtime on March 20th, 2018

'as of' doesn't mean 'at'. This means any account that was or became Omega between March 20 and now, should get the 500k SP
---
TFW a company takes a literal year to work on a broken core part of an MMO, and people ACTUALLY defend them when they do the bare minimum.
---
I've reproduced this and reported it. :)  Thanks.
---
Whoever at CCP made that call, I sincerely hope someone brought you popcorn when the server started successfully accepting connections.
---
gg ez
---
i am sure they knew the risk and they choose the playstyle that led to this BR. And no you dont need subs to support supers in every scenario. they werent salty about it, will prolly krab 2 weeks, get new toys and do it again until these die again without being salty. so no one needs your bad advices that comes from a a very narrow view of things appearently
---
what do you expect when the event is dropped on live servers without even testing it on sisi?
---
i'm so tired of this bullshit, but it's okay lads you can mine the ores!!
---
I think I'm still a ways off being able to sustain Wh life as I'm wanting to get a bit of wallet padding before I start up Wh living. End goal will prolly be jumping from Wh and null living based on what my needs may be. I plan to get into carrier ratting which should supply what I need for Wh life.
---
yeah was a nice suprise, was thinking it be a normal semi afk in gila event but note..
---
right now i will switch to a hecate and go hmtu hunting for all the nice loot 
---
[Ayy, Chat improvements are off the chart](https://www.eveonline.com/ccplease)
---
You don't even need to click+drag, Theres a fucking hotkey, Set it up right and you could theoretically do it even faster. 
---
Such as [Alt+Tab], [Alt+`], Then back around.
---
Now that said, Not everyone would be using this, Some may still be broadcasting, As to the video above. I honestly don't know enough to comment on which it is.
---
[You win](https://i.imgur.com/8YQgCaG.png)
---
which is worse being on goons blacklist or digi had a file on you?
---
Over 100 bil lost in first 30 min. Seems like a great event.
---
&gt;comparing running someone down to accidentally broadcasting a message in chat
---
lmao
---
It's still worth it, every dev who's takes about it, even the few I've met, has repeatedly said how important the are.
---
They capture a lot of additional data, other than what you write and describe.
---
You won't always see the results but it makes a difference.
---
So, ccp just put an instablap npc I'm instead of creating an interesting event?
---
Not sure if that's better or worse than the frostline failure.
---
quit bitching.
---
wts submissions for lowsec gate to stain, 50m/character

We nerfed the Battleship compared to last year.

Returning after 5-year break, are POS towers slowly being phased out and replaced by structures? If yes, is there anything bellow smalest structures availible? 1 bil isk entry point to structures seems really steep entry point to anchorables...

Pretty please don't give him attention. Not in my thread. Please. Thank you.

Olmeca 'they're doing it on purpose,except my friends' Gold with his usual level of gevlon shite.

I'm pretty sure you can check it out from the combat log? It's under accessories icon
---
lmao shut the fuck up, this game needs more risk like that. cant minmax on the test server.
---
well can't say i blame u. deleted, sry ((
---
It's eve, adapt or die(ingame) 
---
Marshy is my friend he did it on accident and I should know, he's my friend! The goons are doing it on purpose and I should know, they're not my friends!
---
These autistic spin threads are getting more and more embarrassing olmeca. 
---
Yay for the 64bit-Tracker. Hope they will add one for when the tiercide is finished or the shield-slaves will be implemented... 🙃
---
it comes under "Automated game play"
---
its not really botting but you are automating your game play using a 3rd party and that's strictly prohibited. 
---
I hope this is not a bug 
---
One more if statement and the legacy code turns AI. 
---
Thank you :-\* Give me your ingame name and you will receive one free drug.
---
Why does this give a feeling of being a canary feature regarding pa? 
---
Because they like winning. 
---
All the values seem to be for an Arty Mach with Quake loaded, except for the Rate of Fire. 
---
I know some people enjoy seeing this, a very "hard and challenging" event.
---
And honestly... I agree! It's good and fair to have a challenging event, since we have been complaining for a long time about the AFK factor present in most events!
---
HOWEVER there is a big difference between something CHALLENGING and some CHEAP!
---
You can jump head first in something, knowing full well about the game mechanics and being yourself a experience and Veteran player, but still get you ass handed to you by the event site... I honestly don't call that challenge, I call that a UNFAIR!
---
I have yet to experience this sites myself, but what I'm seeing right now is just an unfair spawn that is hitting with a disgusting amount of damage... A cheap way to get people killed --"
---
Knowing history, CCP will probably tone this down a notch &gt;.&gt;
---
This is why structures don't die constantly - they are reffed much more often than they die. 
---
Are those sites gated or can you use caps?
---
Looks like it. They took way to less damage for such a brick tanked ship but if they got sucked dry in seconds this makes sense. 
---
Nice one
---
I think you want to re-check whether that's true.
---
I don't know why the pedestrian won't get up. I only hit him at 60mph, I hit the last one at 90. :p
---
Sadly, I don't remember last year's event. Pretty sure I did it since I have a bunch of old spirit skins, though.
---
t. man who sits under super umbrella in his shitty carrier
---
go fuck yourself
---
To be clear, using isboxer isnt illegal, only using its broadcasting features is. The whole program is a suite of tools that allow you to more intelligently switch between clients instead of alt tabbing.
---
It also allows you to only display parts of the game client eg. only the overview of multiple windows at once. I dont remember if that is illegal. 
---
I have never actually used isboxer, to be clear.
---
The beauty of recycling the same content each year... it's not new so I'm allowed to like it!

except didnt goons get evicted from their home in world war bee :thonking:

No gate

excuse me but i sit in a SUPERcarrier
---
WH
---
that's a lot of damage

THank god, now there's more hordes to go around....
---
It looks like stats identical to an Arty Mach with Quake loaded, except a 1.1s rate of fire instead of 11s rate of fire :D
---
iam kind a waiting when all this backstabbing and fuck arounds fall back down on them....
---
maybe some day..... just maybe :) 
---
Seems they aee made for (super)carriers.
---
Not sure why they theb would spawn in highsec tho
---
In my null system i saw a bling loki and tengu killmail appear. They said it was 3 shots before the wreck appeared. 
---
Can we safely say ccp finnaly made a change to/for capitals? ;D
---
Guess this calls for caps. Are the sites gated?
---
Narrator: *It was a bug*
---
Are all the dialog from Atheist Experience episodes?

You cant rsebo or remote track a sieged dread or marauder

"My stealing warrants my ignorance". 
---
Just pay Lax. ISBoxer is dirt cheap for how good it is and hard he works on it... But hey guess not everyone can have moral fiber.
---
If only there was some kind of testing environment to catch these kind of typos before going live!
---
regardless of morality or personal ignorance, ignoring the fact a huge chunk of the players aren't effected by what stainguy posits is ignorance
---
Except for the typo in rate of fire, you mean.
---
the bars are marking the (planned) completion date, there is a time scala in month on top.
---
LOL hope they keep it like this... or maybe not, since that's a little insane
---
This was one of those guys I assume was using the not-allowed portions because the entire fleet would move to and then start mining at exactly the same time. 
---
No. There has been talk about entry level anchorables, but for now they haven't materialized yet. In the meantime, mobile depots can serve as cheap deployables for refitting / loot storage. But depots are very limited in what they can do.
---
Fair, I retract the comment. Probably needs to mark the month under the ship icon or something to make it clearer tbh.
---
the BS does 3K + DPS...
---
Ran two 5/10's just before downtime and picked up 600m. Couldn't decide to go sell or run the events after downtime. Decided to go sell and play later. Good choice on my part apparently.
---
I was just thinking similar. 
---
Apparently it does 3k dps... like to tanking that with a ship that's allowed in high sec...
---
&gt;ISBoxer does have broadcasting disabled by default for EVE, for several years now. Since basically the day they announced the rule changes. That's not a false premise.
---
If you read what I posted you'd see that I already stated and recognized this.
---
&gt;Sorry, you're making shit up here by saying most people use a cracked version of ISBoxer.
---
I know two dozen people who used a cracked version and only like three or four that pay for the main one, but I don't have statistics like that I can only assume that it's a general trend.
---
I'm not advocating for software piracy, I'm just saying almost everyone I know pirates it.
---
But my cheap accelerators :(
---
It's not impossible to do, it's just different in that you can't do it with the usual brainafk ships v0v I really hope it will stay this way
---
During a new release, CCP didnt test before it went live. Never heard of
---
It shoots every 1.1s instead of every 11s.
---
I know buddy, just did not want to put it out there myself hehe
---
Then why mention the time at all?
---
I didn't post a link, it gets created when the image is uploaded. Perhaps I uploaded the image in an improper way?
---
honestly, I hope it will stay :D
---
Battleship and smaller.
---
So CCP expects a ratting ship to be able to tank the alpha of 10 Machs every 1.1 seconds?
---
Yeah it works like that, but to be honest is not that intuitive.
---
It would look better displayed in a progress bar format... which is exactly what it looks like at first glance.
---
CCPlease iterate on changes and rebalance ships andnmodules 
---
&gt; Hope they will add one for when the tiercide is finished 
---
+1... that's gonna be a really long progress bar, probably gonna break the site and everything.
---
So the real question ... when it will be on the list ?        
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
No 1 mach every 1.1s
---
meh
---
While perfect safety is impossible, you can get pretty close by taking a few precautions. In order of descending importance:
---
- Run missions in hi-sec. That's an obvious one.
---
- Only be in corps without structures, or NPC corps. Corps without structures can't be war-decced anymore. Making your own personal corp is very simple if you don't want to deal with corp-politics, but don't want to pay the tax rate of an NPC corp either.
---
- Don't fly anything fancy. T1 battleship with T2 fitting does not make for an interesting gank target. A blinged out faction battleship is a different matter.
---
- Don't engage people trying to bait you. Flying in hi-sec with a sturdy, but cheap ship means that gankers would have to spend considerable resources into killing you. Except if you give them an opening. Someone might come in and harass your MTU or steal your loot and then bait you into shooting them and creating a limited engagement. Don't bite. They'll move on to the next target pretty quickly.
---
- Set notorious gankers to red standings. Look up the systems you plan to do missions in on Zkill and determine if there are any people or groups that do a lot of ganking in the area. Setting them to red standings will give you a useful indicator in local chat when one of them appears.
---
I'm betting NA won't be whining about missing out on the roll out of this event. By the time they wake up I'm guessing the BS dps will have been nerfed. CCP must be laughing their tits off. lol.
---
i thought this was a way to post suggestions for things to be changed on CCP's website and have devs/cm respond to them
---
but no it's just another pr post
---
No gates. There's a cap: https://zkillboard.com/kill/75114670/
---
Educated Guess: they forced this down due to GDPR requirements and their lawyers requiring them to do all kinds of new logging and control over everyhing that was saved (and who had access to it, plus the whole ability to require a company to purge stuff) 
---
It was then rushed with lawyers designing it and nobody with any authority cared if it actually worked. No other way it could stay broken for almost an year.
---
Well damn scaps then lol
---
The last time they ran this event you only had to brace for 2 or 3 volleys at most before it went down, it was still squeaky bum time in the event of a wrecking hit. Now...
---
&gt; We nerfed the Battleship compared to last year's version of the event. /u/CCP_Sledgehammer

:ok_hand:

move your titans!

Name checks out.

Fucking fix faction warfare already. Why the fuck isnt this a priority but the fucking chat and launcher is?
---
This devblog seems to correspond with the final update to [updates.eveonline.com](https://updates.eveonline.com/), with no gathering dates and no update estimates posted for the future, but surely that is just an odd coincidence.
---
&gt; It's eve, adapt ~~or~~ and die(ingame)

Fixed that for ya!

Speaking of "not wanting to put it out there myself" does your mommy know you're homosexual??

That's hardly a cap.

it has frigate rate of fire with battleship guns m8, you did a dumdum
---
They resisted us for 1 year and half. With this frag , they have ended their career with a bang and all the honors.
---
" Yeah , they gonna disband  "
---
This is exactly how I felt when I was in TEST. Sad really. Like you said a good tactician but a manchild lol.
---
Ccplease!!! 
---
I’m sure that’s why skillu blueball when faced with 700 people - the lack of forces lol
---
If the whole fleet moves on the same tick that is probably input broadcasting. If the whole fleets warps, or if all fleet members are set to keep at range and the FC moves that is not input broadcasting
---
No, its the alpha of one mach, but the reload time is 1.1s instead of 11s. So the dps is like a mach, but its fast and concentrated DPS.
---
And projection and movement - especially within one’s own space -  is far too easy 
---
because everyone has been crying like a baby back bitch about the chat and launcher?
---
&gt; but the fucking chat and launcher is?
---
Might be because chat and launcher affects everybody.
---
Yes recently we’ve seen citadels die to only large groups of subcaps whether or not they were defended by super fleets. 
---
&gt; that's what sov warfare is about.
---
Hardly anyone is sov warring
---
So I’m onto something, Dad?
---
It‘s still funny to me how people play a totally different game on the same servers. It‘s also a little sad that so many players are vaccuumed into the so called newbie friendly blobs. 
---
If a T3 Destroyer with speed tank can do it, I will just applaud CCP for changing the rules, if not, it's has I said, this is nothing but a very unfair way to get people killed!
---
dropping supers on battleships? typical tapi behavior, for shame
---
Not sure about Goons, but TEST has had them for like two years. It'll be very surprising if Goons didn't.
---
Just go look at the world population percentages for China and Australia 
---
Well they're almost done fixing chat, what else is there to do?
---
Lol lets replace the working chat and launcher but fuck the rest of the game kek
---
My bad my bad. We're averaging like 5b per system, didn't realise Horde was this inept at securing their renter region.
---
ever heard of fleets and logi?
---
I haven\`t done the event but my guess is that BS do 0 dmg if u approach on spiraling and orbit under the arty guns. Dmg application should be crap if u sig/speed tank.
---
So what you're saying is that it has become easier to fight each other. Sounds good to me.
---
Yes. I'll recommand dual rattlesnakes or a 20 man frig fleet. 
---
Good luck.
---
Normally id say titan but thats deployedd atm. Also i aint dropping on the bs, i heared there are frigs in there! Gotta drop those frigs
---
So do cynos
---
Get gud
---
I agree, don't nerf this.
---
yeah its a bit over the top but it illustrates my point. do something against the TOS even if it is an accident (which it almost positively can't be) get banned. don't like it then don't put yourself in a situation to break the TOS 
---
I have to ask now, Atalama is that you?
---
The level of shitposting is just that low.

To be devils advocate, it's supposed to be for QOL and little things.
---
In reality it's because CCP doesn't remember what fwar is
---
Sig/speed tank! No more Gilas ...
---
Doesn't seem to have hurt them at all in the long run. Quite the contrary, in fact.
---
i am sure the new 64bit client will the fully tested and work flawless from day 1.
---
like the new chat.
---
What’s its tracking speed?
---
I guess just stay outside 65k ... sounds like VNI country to me *sigh*
---
Pathetic. 
---
&gt; So what you're saying is that it has become easier to fight each other
---
The reverse. Ease of projection is ease of blobbing
---
Yes, it's just a coincidence.
---
Sucks for me.. I have been affected by the issue but since I was on a break none of my accounts were active at that time.. Thanks for a working chat at least I guess.. :/
---
I logged in, didn't bother looking at the chat, and went and ran the site. Complained bitterly about the lack of lewtz then realised I had dodged a bullet as I didn't get he BS spawn.
---
U forgot to add: asking for a friend!
---
Did you mean to respond to someone else? There are no ansiblex gates in Deklein that I can use.
---
Agreed! I resubbed a few months ago, and have been affected by the problem as well. Didn't have any active omegas in March 2018 so I guess no SP at all for me then.. Sure that's fair.
---
Fw needs a qol update that has already been layed out by multiple members of every militia so it isnt shit. 
---
A Raitaru is 600M, which doesn't seem very steep at all if you ask me. Space is littered with them as it is, if anything they should be more prohibitive.
---
get friends and use logi
---
Thoughts? THOUGHTS!?
---
Tiercide isn't there. I'm a bit mad. The end.
---
Just throw more Gilas at it! 
---
vov I banged that drum for years Maree, and I was proved right about it. But people didn't like their good innocent fight generating power projection being nerfed as if they were bad wrong blobber rentlords, so now we have to learn the lesson again. 
---
Meanwhile as far as I'm concerned I'm happy to ram power projection down the throats of the hypocritical shitlers who cried endlessly about Phoebe, but now they're not on top suddenly power projection is the worst ever. Fuck em.
---
yes of course, i don't do that ! i am just asking for a friend !
---
Frigate menace?
---
You could probably bling a paladin into 3k DPS tank but I saw a paladin die in delve to the site so vOv
---
Let the tears rain of all the carebears that can't do this content in a T1 frig and be spoon fed content and rewards.
---
What's the tracking like? Possible to get under the guns and eat it with t3ds/AFs?
---
The same used to hold true about reffing R64 moons. 
---
Which incidentally you can still do.
---
Sometimes I wonder if goon line members need just as many friends online to make them feel confident in their reddit posts.
---
It fires every 1.1s with 
---
\-40 Explosive 
---
\-8 Kinetic 
---
(x76) 
---
so it does \~3.3k DPS
---
correct tanking mods, maybe double explosives instead one of each are better, PYFA or the Simulator will tell
---
There are bigger problems.
---
https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/info/?typeid=47275 Battleship stats
---
Although it seems they've changed the stats for it and are taking reimbursement tickets.
---
Well... seems about right :)
---
I went out in my Cerb (while i am a recently returned player, the fit was not "crazy" by any means), and took down several waves, while they ate away at my shield at... worrying speed. Then a BS was spawned (B\*something\*) that took me out in two shots in seemingly as many seconds (3 maybe). Adios Cerb...
---
Of course that made me mad... so i came back in a heavily tanked Drake.  14k shields, 70+ resist omnitank. 3 shots, and that shield was just gone.. warped out after less than 10 seconds in there, with 1000 or so shields left.
---
So i figured that their... "wonderful event" isn't really tankable by any subcapital. At least not solo.. 
---
Where did the times go when you had a site per system and boosters dropped.
---
Just like frostline i will be skipping this. Wish they would add a scannable site per event that comes out instead of the events.
---
But that's too much wooooooooooooork :(
---
At least 3 of the current snuff directors/FC’s began their FC career at around that age.
---
They fixed it apparently :(
---

---
The killboard is all guardian gala kills!
---
Unlike the chat, it is not unreasonable to assume you can run 64bit and 32bit side by side. Or at least switch back.
---
couldn't the drf/xix/whatever they were called outescalate skillu and friends pretty easily in cap numbers at least?
---
Cramming 6000+ people into a system happened before ansiblex, you have no proof it has led to more blobbing. What we do have proof of is that moving around is less tedious now. Plus the actual problem you seem to have with them is blobbing. Not projection. Until CCP nerfs n+1, the only thing the jump bridges do is make it a tiny bit less cancerous to be an F1 pusher. 
---
JB's also make it easier for roaming to happen because you aren't taking your 3au/s ship 50 jumps anymore, its just 25 now. 
---
A small word of advice. ALWAYS scout yourself, light your own cyno's. Oh and don't get scammed. 
---
What do we need more null space for? Do you know how much of it is dead/uninhabited?
---
I thought this might be a constructive communication avenue between CCP and the players, but I guess it's just another PR publicity stunt where they pretend like they're doing things we want.
---
&gt;It also allows you to only display parts of the game client eg. only the overview of multiple windows at once. I dont remember if that is illegal.
---
That is also against the rules. You can use it to reposition/tile/arrange normal client windows, but not to overlay portions of those windows.
---

local nullblobber gets confused when others can't just pull out 50 people out of thin air to fight theirs, what else is new
---
Yeah, I know about the fleet warps
---
im sure they all just clicked they're drones in key bind at the same time as a result of being on comms with a fc/intel guy.  nothing to see here folks.  Just people listening to the commands on comms.
---
the bombers bar guy got banned just a month ago. :)
---
CCP tested this.  In their invincible dev ships, everything is fine.
---
Well more communication  is always good.
---
He's still upset that the rage eviction never got as much traction as they wanted. 
---
Vargur could do it just fine. It won't be able to permatank it but it will kill the BS without risk or dying.
---
Brb quickly moving some supers.
---
I didn't check it and don't get this message in T3 :\\
---
just get under the guns 4Head
---
I was exited about the event.... that was the previous week.
---
&gt;  People should really stop witch-hunting actual players for “complicity” because they choose to care about other things and not waste their time on hunting/kicking/reporting bots.
---
while I do agree with not caring what they do is actively tell them *not* to report, so they do care about it. If it was just silence or a shrug saying its too much work that should be done by ccp sure, but it gets hard when someone who wants to give ccp the stuff gets told not to cause "you can't be sure" things start getting complicated.
---
&gt; Any idea what that BS is shooting with?
---
Guns
---
↑ memed
---
LMAO DIDN'T WANT THAT REGION ANYWAY 
---
Mehh CCP please break chat again... This way botters Will eat à bag of D**** thanks :) 
---
Not really. I tried very hard to stay there because I really liked my corp. But after several months of being camped, and an alliance/coalition that was unable/unwilling to match the capital escalation there was no reason to remain. Mining in procurers and VNI ratting when you've got rorqual and super pilots just seemed ridiculous. 
---
I like PVP, but I also like to play casually. The constant camping and dropping of blops or supers on anything larger than a procurer eventually made it ridiculous to stay. Our inability to counter the threat, and the unwillingness of our allies to help counter the drops was a pretty clear signal to move on. So I did.
---
I ended up joining one of the major donuts so that I could continue to play casually and not have to worry about being camped for 6 months. Seriously, we were camped and actively hunted for 8 months of the year I spent in the drone regions. 
---
What else are you going to do? When your allies and friends are giving up, and moral is a joke, would you have stayed the course? When you can't enjoy any part of the game that you're paying to play for several months, would you have remained?
---
Most people would have fucked off, and most people did. Our numbers online went from 150-200, to 20-40, and our fleet participation plummeted. Our FCs stopped trying to rally defense fleets. Our leaders gave vague assurances that something would be done. So I kept waiting, and waiting. And finally I fucked off too.
---
Active camping by numbers you can't counter drives casual players into bigger donuts.
---
So it's a roadmap.
---
They are separate people all on same comms.
---
Tracking is 1.4 --&gt;  Weapon Accuracy Score	1.4   
---
the problem are the support ships with 10 webs on you
---
What?
---
Yes; however, with the new war dynamics, they still have their use.
---
Safe lp farm working as intended, where's the problem? :P
---
Well, have you looked at the killboard of that thing? it wrecked ships for 1-2b. right now you need about 95% explosive resistances or more just to be able to survive that monstrosity since the combination of a 3.6k dps boss + tons of webbing leaves you only with facetanking that thing
---
So you don't have to rewind netflix
---
you need confidence to post on reddit?
---
Ship geometry affects SB range.... never found a way to directly compare them before noticing this.  
---
its dps is way higher :)
---
this could be the best story in the world but the fact that its hosted on EN24 is going to make me downvote this.
---
most anti-cheat software sucks shit and only prevents the most casual cheaters, while making life miserable for everyone else.
---
blizzard had some of the strictest anti-cheat anywhere, but still were helpless against honorbuddy until they owned them with a lawsuit. CCP by comparison struggles to make chat work.
---
Fake news. PGL can't be calm 
---
&gt; the lot of us are dumb as bricks, don't risk bluefucking because your dumbass can't tell a bot from a person.
---
imagine drinking the koolaid so hard you'd sooner believe you're wrong and a dumbass than questioning the party line.
---
also i'm sorry to break it to ya but the report button doesn't ban anyone, CCP does. Unless you're telling me that ccp are also dumbasses that can't tell bots from persons.
---
As if they even contributed to PL anyway. I've seen more reddit posts by them, than killmails.
---
I heard a rumour that the reason they're developing a 64 bit client is so that there's more memory available to display ads in the client, and that you'll soon have to unironically pay PLEX each month to replace the default skin of your carrier which will now be covered in more ads than a Gurista's brothel. 
---
Hotdroppers everywhere rejoice!
---
lol people who like fatigue still exist?
---
There is is an official CCP Chip length?!
---
Damn, they take their snacking seriously.
---
I wonder if ruffled chips change the equation?
---
Would a battlecruiser be any better?
---
I know this is probably a old thing for most players but I saw my first Titan the other day! My corp recently joined a new alliance and we went to bash a structure using a Titan to make a bridge to the system. Nothing particularly interesting happened but seeing a titan up close was awesome!
---
Also sat on a Wormhole to my home system, about to jump through cloaked up when like 3 BC's jump ontop of me like 4km away, I slow boated away from the whole so they wouldn't break my cloak and had to wait for the right time to slip past them so I didn't end up stranded in J space
---
imagine all the purple fit titans getting sacrificed for a permanent lowsec MOTD for biggest kill lmao
---
Especially on Saturday nights. Nothing of interest happens there, just a bunch of haulers going through with supplies. 
---
Begone with your gayazo
---
Just for you: https://i.imgur.com/lKAdblu.jpg

This is a great change, CCP should keep it!
---
“Edit: also I suck at spelling”
---
...and knowing is half the battle. 
---
Valid point.
---
No, that was his 'other video,' which clearly showed grrr goons 'input broadcasting,' where the drones were hidden from the overview--and also, like this video, was more indicative of some try hard eve player using 'alt-tab' + a recall hotkey. 
---
However, grrr goons. Amiright everyone?

Tell me more about how goons are ruining your eve career? Here is a hint (for everyone). New Eden is a big place, if someone is bothering you, move somewhere else.

bee guys accusing others of having brain aids lmao

This is where I love being in NA.  Eli can watch the new events roll out and people figure them out for about 10 hrs before I get home from work. Then go and enjoy them myself knowing what I'm getting into. 
---
Jesus, it's already killed [nearly a trillion isk](http://prntscr.com/mk2g83)
---
It's like none of you have ever heard of donating plasma.  Easy 20 to 50 bucks.  Eve already has your souls, might as well lay your blood at its altar too.  Upside is you help save a life somewhere at the same time.
---
I recall an event last year where everyone in the first few hours got billions and billions of blood raider loot. Sometimes being first in is in your favor... sometimes it's not.
---
Yeah, so... buying RMT'd isk is cheaper than CCPs plex price *everywhere in the world.* That's why the RMT market for isk still exists... people can get twice the isk RMTing than they could using plex for the same amount of money. 
---
Literally unplayable. 
---
CCP made a type and the BS was shooting every 1.1 second, instead of every 11.
---
classic.
---
It's almost like an event that needs to be run by more than one person.
---
Is this event in every system or its the aids of having 1 in a constellation?
---
"Gila" Event
---
Seddow you should really be using this to your advantage now. Think of all the possibilities...you can move your Titan anywhere now without losing it!
---
I think CCP needs to add a new bar on their CCPlease website for "Testing our shit before release"
---
You mean you can't just assume what worked before will work now? HOW UNFAIR!
---
Fair enough
---
Yeah he’s a genuinely good dude, he has just found entosising TKE to be extremely entertaining.
---
Thank you, this was a good post and well deserved of !silver
---
Fair enough - the entry level for c3 is a 500mil rattlesnake and another 500-1bil for your structure. Very low skills reqs and you’ll make all that back in a week.
---
But it’s definitely a steeper learning curve than null ratting, and in one of the big groups you’re p damn safe. 
---
we're only 3 for 3 on major supercap brawls, we need to step it up and improve that ratio to beyond 100%
---
&gt;ure it can be done really fast, but why would someone mining alone in a guarded system care about alt tabbing and assigning drones at warp speed everytime?  I understand there are a lot of legitmate ones out there, but cmon.  I could care less if it is a goon.
---
Have you played this game before? I mean, look at the supercap/cap ratting guides that all say 'make sure you are pre-aligned to the next combat site!'   
---
In other words, for a lot of people everything is about isk per hour. For someone who cares enough to have a bagillion Rorqual pilots, this probably doubly the case. Meaning, some people are pretty goddamned autistic about their isk grinding. 
---
^ This guy sounds salty AF.
---
That damage modifier makes me someone fat-fingered those keys...
---
&gt; If you’re the little guy you’re dead if you’re caught, that’s just the way it is. Not saying I have a problem with it; we’re aware of it and accept those risks every time we drop.
---
Hey man, as a member of one of the big null blocs, I respect your moxie and you're absolutely right. Keep doing dope shit.
---
File a bug report?
---
I love how all you said is wrong
---
Gaara was ban after lighting 50 cyno at the same time, that's where the 50 cyno meme come from.
---
Mashy was ban after using input broadcasting and spam the same message at the exact same second on 4 account, he was then unban, my own theory on this is, he only get a 1 week ban or something because he was not caught doing it before (botter have the same punishment, 1 week then 1 month then permaban, I don't even want to bother finding the CCP post about this you are not worth my time).
---
&gt; Goons still complaining about it, if you guys don't like how CCP is handling the rules, leave for another game and stop spamming reddit with your shit.
---
So let's all stop complaining about anti-goons botter/input broadcaster because goons have not right to being mad about illegal people getting away grr goons or dare they. The difference between you and us, is goons did not spam reddit about how gaara was legit and about how "hey maybe he did it, but look how other have a lot of botter/input broadcasting user". Because unlike you guys, we are not pushing a pathetic narrative to pretend we are not full of shit, we are pushing a better and fair game for everyone.
---
Lol....didnt ccp give everyone like a 6 month heads up that cynos were being regrouped in overview.
---
And like a week ago fucking announce in a dev blog the day had finally arrived.
---
God damn. 
---
You can bind them by profile, at least. 
---
And still being unable to beat AT ship killmails.
---
Maybe ask for it to be optional so you don't screw over people that use the same overview for all their characters on an account (which I'm guesing is most of us)?
---
I would imagine similar amounts of energy equating to "Day X of something not happening" posts
---
imagine not grouping your guns
---
what did it drop?
---
Or try to use the same OV for all characters on all accounts. 
---
Up to which point are we going to assume that all multiboxxing rorqual pilots that end up in a youtube video have the apm of Korean professionals? If they do, why the fuck aren't they making money out of big competitions? Or maybe all Korean professionals relax by multiboxxing Rorquals in Eve?
---
Yeah but aren't *your* forces
---
It's not their fault if your alliance is unable to defend its own space.
---
Yeah, I'm that lazy aswell.

Theres so many good arguments, you decided to take a retarded one.

I'll make it this time I swear

i'm probably gonna incur the wrath of all reddit now, but who is Pete? I'm not trolling, if there's an individual that has already expressed similar opinions to mine, I'd gladly get behind him and push (no pun intended).

---
I tell myself that every time too :P
---
No, there acting like covert cynos even when you can see them on grid with the correct overview
---
It's always _glad you guys have the balls to drop meanwhile we massively escalate and blob on you_.
---
I'd be ashamed to even say anything 
---
they could just warp out when they see NPC tacklers?
---
Right.  That's basically what people from all over the game seem to be saying.  Subcaps are really fun, but these days if capitals are an option you have to take them, otherwise you get capitals dropped on you and your subcaps get annihilated because capitals have crazy application punching downward for some reason.
---
Surprised nobody awox's them... super easy and potentially hilarious kills.
---
They are welcome to watch me at any time mate. I can dig your alliance trolling, it's the only way Horde could take down INIT. GG-
---
I am salty. I was there, but I now have to jf more fighters. No one cares about the logistics.
---
We still do. Sometimes we also feed in nullsec
---
You're saying the dumbest fucking things and you don't even realize it. 
---
&gt;Not really. I tried very hard to stay there  because I really liked my corp. But after several months of being  camped, and an alliance/coalition that was unable/unwilling to match the  capital escalation there was no reason to remain. Mining in procurers  and VNI ratting when you've got rorqual and super pilots just seemed  ridiculous.
---
I agree. I think it's ridiculous that you have a ton of super and pilots capable of flying rorqs but can't defend your space. Slap some tank on that bad boy and actually drop it on something that can shoot back. 
---
&gt; The constant camping and dropping of blops or supers on anything larger  than a procurer eventually made it ridiculous to stay. Our inability to  counter the threat, and the unwillingness of our allies to help counter  the drops was a pretty clear signal to move on. So I did. 
---
Seems like it would be pretty easy to bait then...
---
There have been two instances where we have been baited. The first time resulted in the loss of my Hel, the second time resulted in the loss of my Nyx and Titan as we see here. You didn't have the inability to counter us, it was, and still is, simply being risk adverse. 
---
&gt; I ended up joining one of the major donuts so that I could continue to  play casually and not have to worry about being camped for 6 months.  Seriously, we were camped and actively hunted for 8 months of the year I  spent in the drone regions. 
---
I know, I was doing it. 
---
&gt;What else are you going to do? When your  allies and friends are giving up, and moral is a joke, would you have  stayed the course? When you can't enjoy any part of the game that you're  paying to play for several months, would you have remained?
---
I would try and organize a defense, get dread bombs ready, set bait ops, actually fight back to counter the people who are encroaching on our space. 
---
&gt;Most people would have fucked off, and most  people did. Our numbers online went from 150-200, to 20-40, and our  fleet participation plummeted. Our FCs stopped trying to rally defense  fleets. Our leaders gave vague assurances that something would be done.  So I kept waiting, and waiting. And finally I fucked off too.
---
Yup, your leadership is shit. They never offered to pay us off which I was clearly angling for, content that as long as you were paying rent they didn't give a fuck. Think you can't do anything yourself? Look what I did to your alliance\*.
---
*\** Disclaimer, I did all the cloaky camping and retarded solo kills, but clearly many of the lazerhawk bro's were participating as well. Point being by making an effort you can help encourage others to make a big difference.
---
&gt;Active camping by numbers you can't counter  drives casual players into bigger donuts. If you don't want big donuts,  don't punch the little guy until they're forced to join one.
---
Bullshit you can't counter the numbers. We just lost half our super fleet and it was \~5-6 dudes. You've never caught us off guard before and you only need to do that once to wipe out a super fleet. You, your previous leadership, and your previous alliance is simply too incompetent to do so. 
---
No but you definitely need less. 
---
At least they did not fuck up the event this time /s
---
Maybe he has a hotkey set to launch drones. I myself use the tilde key to launch my mining drones. Can do it quite quickly using while cycling through my different clients using Eve-o.  \*shrug\*
---
Can you please record yourself launching 28 separate sets of drones within 10 sec?
---
Iceland clocks run at 1/50th of the rest of the worlds, asking CCP to do anything faster than glacial pace is beyond science.

Music made me think of Diablo II.

You learned a valuable life lesson. When you have a good wife who cooks for you, washes your clothes and takes care of you when you are sick, don’t try and run off with a crack-addict stripper who’ll sell your BMW to her dealer and leave you to wake up one morning in a bathtub full of ice with your kidney missing.

you know fight didnt happen unless there is video footage of it right?

LoL...words coming from the guy that changed sides him self in a blink of an eye...

OP is an academic. It's in his nature.
---
That's not an isk sink.
---
Hehe, can't wait to get my butt back behind a decent PC (Sunday is sooo close!) and join back in Horde's crazy adventures! Steady, keep some drops for me, I'm comiiiing!
---
Mad props to LH, dropping like that and getting nice brawls is unusual, actually not being salty after losing is maddeningly rare in New Eden nowadays. 
---
I was there last month. got 4.5B!
---
OOF
---
the scenario that i gave does not require elite SC2 apm, your argument is a strawman. If the rorq pilot in the video was able to drop drones for twice as many accounts in the same amount of time that would be suspect, because as you said, you would need korean pro apm to do that. 
---
True. It's a salt harvester.
---
Great idea, oh wait only the one killing the rats gets the ticker up and the loot is aweful for fleets 
---
Is that the new DPS or old DPS?
---
NA to EU: "You got first, there may be shooting."
---
also rebalancing some navy cruisers and navy battleships would also help FW, if every faction had desirable ships that people could cash in on.
---
Would a C5 marauder work?
---
It's was one of the first things I noticed as I started, watching the titans an comparing their length with other ships
---
That includes the event last year, which killed ~700b. This year it's only killed ~200b (albeit just in the first *few hours*).
---
So you’re saying a pally with assclaps?
---
Big Oof
---
MB then.
---
The new player experience team is one of the more robustly staffed teams I ran into when working with CCP.  It was also one of the most receptive to feedback on how to improve its offering and has many times proactively reached out for further feedback. Worth noting that a game of such insane difficulty and complexity(thats why we love it right?) makes a real challenge to find a way to soften the on ramp for new players but they continue to try to find ways. 
---
I dont know what any of this dumb shit you are white knighting about chat has to do with it but thats the experience of this humble CSM.

I dont understand this argument. If you have so much free time to grind isk in the game to afford a sub you also have enough time to work part time somewhere to earn that isk in RL cash instead. Unless of course you enjoy the grind then what is there to complain about?

Adding to this it's really easy to pull off if you have a keybind to drop drones and a keybind to cycle through windows or some kind of decent overlaying window layout.

---
Perhaps you should take a look at zkill. how often would you say capitals are used to call for this reaction? Like every other kill, right?  
---
* Out of the top 10 most commonly used ships at the time of snapshot for the top 10 corps, there are 2 capitals (Moros with 12 kills by TGRADS and Thanatos with 27 kills by Black Crows - both in slot 10) out of 100 top 10 subsets.  
---
* Out of the top 10 alliances, again 100 subset top 10s, only ONE slot is a capital. Frat using the Thanatos for 233 kills.  
---
* The most commonly used ships are bombers, sabres and Lokis.  
---
#* 99 out of 100 top 10 most used (by kill) ships by the top alliances are sub-capitals.
---
#* 98 out of 100 top 10 most used (by kill) ships by the top corps are sub-capitals.  
---
I mean, the narrative is really strong here- but it's just not factually accurate. At all. Like... not even close. 
---
When I’m home I can SS the alliance mail. Guess that would have made it more believable in the first place lol
---
Lol, hi evan.
---
Would be neat if an "incursion" in nullsec was exactly that - a concerted attempt by NPC's to take a constellation.
---
I'm in hi sec shooting at npcs.
---
Is there any other time that would be more allowable? 
---
That would only work, if PanFam, Gotg and all those renter-lords around skillU would join in. Pretty much anything else would be destined to fail, so I doubt it will happen. But hey, a war would be fun, I guess. 😊
---
but as we all now know, ccp is good at scaling things very wide
---
It was a bait...
---
Almost as if Marauders were relevant again for a few hours until this got fixed. 
---
Great! Now where do we vote to have do everything except the things you THINK you need to do CCP?
---
I thought so too. I use two different ones and I have not noticed that it changed either way.
---
So they remain in game, just as we see.
---
I'm actually more comfortable in wormholes than null sec tbh. Currently run a snake for most my tasks even in null. I actually have the isk to purchase everything to move into a wormhole but it would break my wallet and I'd rather have backup funds just in case.
---
Yea they tried that like 1 year ago.
---
Didn't work.
---
But of course, now it's a totally different time. Now it should work.
---
Right?
---
Probably you are right and I am retarded. English is not my primary language, that's why I still do not understand how that 'as-of' works, but based to the others pointing it out, I guess my assumption was wrong.
---
One thing about eve mining, as a newer player I find myself reluctant to do it simply because it seems to be a complete waste of time without a multi botting account. 
---
As a single character, alpha account, I am almost certain that it is a complete waste of time when compared to low sec belt ratting even.
---
Though Im a new alpha player so I might be wrong.
---
Thank you for clarification!

Good post and observation ... from an old Co2 enemy.

Oh, and the obligatory “grr goons” 😊
---
Most of them are adopting or have already have adopted the rmt/botting renting bullshit. No surprise if ultimately test turns on goonswarm since part of gotg was already in cahoots with them and fraternity for years now. 
---
I have to set up each overview separately. How are you doing it? I'd love to set them up once per account.
---
Well, if you always compare one character with the plenty, everything will be a waste of time. 
---
You do what you enjoy, stop comparing or chasing someone else's goals. Take it from an old vet with only two characters. 
---
(it's so weird that "only two characters" even is a thing).

Oh thank god the "maybe had this happen" contingent have someone to maybe look after them.  
---
An old doctrine before CCP nerfed the lock range of interdiction nullified t3cs. Rail tengus with no tank, insane range, impossible to scan fast enough without virtues. Basically if you wanted to field people, but couldn’t field enough you would warp in&gt;align&gt;lock&gt;blap&gt;warp if you had tackle coming in. 
---
&gt; No surprise if ultimately test turns on goonswarm 
---
I doubt that will happen as long as PanFam exists. Goonswarm is no threat to test due to no interest in the space, but test has learned that PanFam will go after them, if they have the chance.
---
Hi, darkythekid
---
&gt;from game client perspective there is no difference between that, and setting up one-button macro that does that while also alt-tabbing through active windows in order
---
The information the client has does not determine legality. A macro that effectively sends multiple commands could very well be "visible" on the server-side because of its speed. Particularly over time compared to some "normal" baseline.
---
Because humans can look at things like context and intent, they have more information and can design a policy accordingly.
---
:joy:
---
?
---
Oh dear Fraternity. Should we remind you what happen last time? 
---
He wasn’t pulling it out of his ass. Downvote all you want lol, but the context of how he said it makes no sense. There was no counterintelligence / propaganda benefit in saying it.

Feel free to disregard that part then.

Umm what I’m like 99% sure I replied to xpredatorz from darkness

Can anyone confirm the incoming DPS is manageable now (in a properly fitted PvE ship)?
---
that worked so well for previously banned alliance leaders
---
take turns. make a lottery for the loot
---
Also the last time we teamed up with PL vs GOONS we got evicted afterwards.
---
So yeah, GOONS are much better frenemies than PanFam.  
---
Right now Legacy/GOONS fight eachother except when Panfam is on grid, this works for all parties and should not change.
---
&gt; But hey, a war would be fun, I guess.
---
Can I name this war already at this point "World War Tidi"
---
Slippery petes are basically sniper tengus (railguns, couple of sebos, couple tracking comps, covert-ops), you snipe everything within 200km range. If anything comes too close to you and you're not able to kill it, cloak/warp off and reposition yourself for another run.   
---
They have low DPS but they're really efficient at hit and run tactics, especially against tackle fleets or interdictors
---
The Petes were so disgusting in nova.
---
Though tbh I'd give more credit to the dictor pilots that kept everything tackled.
---
I heard Jay and rorqual miners like to club baby seals.
---
Wishful thinking: the post.

The rest of nullsec is outnumbered by goonswarm and test and there’s absolutely zero chance all of them work together

Well because if this is true goonswarm could go and steam roll FRT.

If you want any specific advice, you really need to share your fits and methods so that people know what to say. Short of that, look for groups ingame that are doing the sort of stuff you want to do and join one that seems a good fit for you, and get advice from them.

if that was all it took to launch an invasion then the whole game would be in a constant state of war

That is only one facet of the new player experience. Notice how the post also talks about returning players. Also its pretty obvious I was talking about this scenario, not the ISM. Feel free to call me more names though, I'm sure that will encourage an engaging discussion.

you're pretty much right yes, depending on what space you're in the best isk/hr is salvaging wrecks or exploration
---
I'm an outsider in this, but when your goal is to play casually, why would you go through all that effort when you can just join the donut for close to no effort. Then the campers are no longer concern when you can just N+1 them.
---
Also rework cloaky camping. It takes no effort to harass with but countering it takes a lot of effort. No wonder people quit because of it.

Unfortunatly  , you dont have much options when it comes to Running Mission in NPC null. As many group that "own" those area , have no reason whatsoever to let you run those in peace . Plus you are the occasional content they can aquire .

High Angle Weapon. It's cap guns with higher tracking and less damage. It's meant to be an anti-subcap type weapon.
---
High Angle Weapon systems on dreadnaughts are designed specifically for shooting subcapital ships.
---
you are correct. however when you are a casual player you shouldnt go on reddit crying about ppl that play the game not casually. just join the donut and be done with it. 
---
I don't know, maybe it overwrites the whole account when you import an overview. Because that is what I am doing all the time.
---
2 sites I have ran have only had ~2,500 total Amethystic Crystallite. Seems a bit low since you would have to run just over 2 sites to get 1 of those meh lootboxes.
---
I assumed they were not sieged as they would need to catch reps to survive long enough to kill that many battleships.
---
Rattlesnakes can easily get 3k, especially if they're shooting fixed damage types. Most C5 fits can tank 3K omni dps.

/r/ChoosingBeggars 
---
It's like you think you invented software piracy or something. When I was a kid I downloaded cracked shit too. If you're an adult with a job, it's a pretty lame excuse and you should probably be treated with the same respect you show.
---
I went with subscription model because I don't think you should have to pay $100 up front for Inner Space in order to use it for a few months. The product also does not need a redesign every 2 years to make you separately purchase "Inner Space XP" and then "Inner Space Vista" and then "Inner Space 7", and in fact the same subscription covers all of my products, there's never been a separate purchase in 15 years of business.
---
Also, how are those EVE Online subscription payments working out for you?
---
&gt; I'm an outsider in this, but when your goal  is to play casually, why would you go through all that effort when you  can just join the donut for close to no effort. Then the campers are no  longer concern when you can just N+1 them.
---
I agree in part. In the current meta if you purely want to krab the smartest thing to do is go and join goons. Sucks, but that's simply the truth. The only hope you have of killing things is to get in, kill it quickly, and get out, otherwise N+1 always wins. 
---
&gt;Also rework cloaky camping. It takes no  effort to harass with but countering it takes a lot of effort. No wonder  people quit because of it.
---
Because cloaky camping is one of the very few things that people can actually do to have an asymmetrical impact on space. EVE used to be a game where you could shoot stuff, now people are simply complaining about having to defend themselves while doing Rorquals online. You've got blue donuts, intel bots, near 2, bubble fucked gates, PANIC modules, cyno jammed systems, but you want to nerf cloaky camping because people don't feel safe with a neut in local and will quit? Perhaps they would be more comfortable in high sec. 
---
The idea that cloaky camping takes no effort is dumb. It takes no effort to sit in a system afk, aside from subscription costs, but if you're just sitting then you're also not a threat. It takes putting isk on field to \*actually do damage\* to something, and in every case within B0T space they could easily out escalate us if they grew some balls and / or caught us. 
---
That's what happens when you try to reason with a gerbal.

When simulating T3Cs fits in-game from a blank template, is there a way to select and add subsystems to the simulation without opening another window?

I know I've seen a little bit of activity outside of GMVA, but yeah, your assessment is pretty accurate (/unbiased, haha).

I'm hoping that Salt Farmers and maybe the Heiian Conglomerate come back so we can all throw down like we used to.  I miss CALSF/MBLOC too, but definitely understand why they left.  :(

So you got set red after killing them?

---
The having two characters thing isn't weird. It's looking at Characters in a different way than they do ships that's weird.   
---
Characters are just like ammo... you get them to go into a ship the same way you buy ammo to put into a gun. Once you're done with the character you can sell it vOv. 
---
If you have to do a mission in a busy high-sec area, consider running without an MTU because those are grief magnets.
---
Flair up so we know which big blob you press F1 in. Fatigueless travel does nothing else but empower large power blocs. You hate fatigue because you're constantly jumping around huge swaths of space you either don't use or rent out to defend it from people without the advantage of instant, fatigueless travel. Spare me.
---
You can practice on the test server.
---
&gt;software as a service L U L   
---
&gt;I'd pay for it if it was a one time fee, not a subscription.
---
L U L.  EVE and all subscription MMO's are the very definition of Software as a Service.  And when most MMO's start, you usually pay a "one time fee" up front (which might include some fixed timeframe of use), and then you also get to pay an ongoing subscription as well!.
---
Yes you can "earn" your subscription costs by doing in game things, but somewhere along the way,  someone is paying for that and you then have to harvest it by spending your time.
---
I haven't mined or ratted in probably 4 years.  Fuck if I know what people are capable of these days, and no, I don't trust the average linemember to know.
---
&gt;Unless you're telling me that ccp are also dumbasses that can't tell bots from persons
---
welllllll
---
Do what you enjoy.
---
For every activity you can think off in this game, I can guarantee that there will be someone earning 10x as much doing the same but being more optimized, with more accounts, more experience, anything that'll make you think you're "wasting your time".
---
Want to mine ? Someone will be there multiboxing 10 rorquals. Want to prod ? Someone will already have entire lines setups for Titan BPCs or access to almost unique T2 BPOs. etc etc
---
You're not wasting time, as long as you don't *lose* money and you have fun.    
---
Even losing money can be fun sometimes. It's like spending money to go to the movies. You lost money, but you had fun. Was it worth it ? Probably.

Here's another quote by the same author. Bear it in mind over the next few weeks:
---
"They make a desert and call it peace"
---
alpha accounts
---
now repeat that 10 times 
---
Wrong. CCP plans to introduce alphas to rorq mining. To treat them more fairly and increase the players practicing this kind of underused gameplay.
---
my grandma
---
anddor being salty over missing a chance to use supers, wouldn't have seen that coming.
---
To fuck with us CCP would have them mine the good stuff first
---
People who bait out supers always commend their targets on dropping their supers and Titans, when the reality is that it is usually complacency (or stupidity) that gets them caught, not the size of their balls. Might as well just say "glad you're dumb enough to keep feeding us supers and Titans friend". 
---
What point of playing this game full of bots and developer dont fuckin care about it?
---
"Best isk/hr is salvaging wrecks"
---
What kind of place has enough mayhem to produce a bunch of wrecks but is safe enough to salvage them?
---
It Could be optional. Not forced on anyone
---
I feel like the hardest thing new players have is separating that "main" mentality from Eve that's present in other MMO's. 
---
I'm not telling people how to play, have 1 character or 50 accounts whatever the player wants, but I think if new players realized that they could spread certain functions over different characters (even if it's just one thing like hauling or explo) it can open up the game so much. Most of us here already know that but I thought I might mention it in case one person sees this and learns about it.
---
That being said, managing multiple accounts can be tedious so make sure that fits within personal goals.
---
MORE DAKA
---
IIRC, it was accompanied by heavy neuting.
---
&gt;like for suicide ganking, for example, where you're undocking 20 accounts at a time

HK not answer the phone?  or not get called?

LOL it was killing all the tengus and gilas, It was doing good job. Must be new feature new event has both mining and salt farming. Nice CCP
---
Find a place that serves drinks, post something here with a date and an RSVP link to estimate attendance, show up with an eve sign and sit at a table. If there’s enough people make a reservation. 
---
Probably take a few to grow it out, but after a few you’ll definitely meet people willing to help expand if needed
---
Yes, they say "be aligned to a safe spot or a station, until the last wave in the Haven, then pre-align to the next Haven..." 
---
Whereas, I like to pre-aligned to a Keepstar and stay aligned to that Keepstar until all the rats are dead, and my fighters have been recovered, and then and only then (after assessing intel and local) warp to the next Haven. 
---
But yeah, the concentration on isk/hr and maximizing the efficiency of farming isk is very, very strong in some people. I am assuming anyone willing to deal with the hassle of multi-boxing more than two Rorquals (let alone 12+) is going to fall into that category. 
---
This is especially the case for regular people who aren't Russian clepto-capitalist oligarchs who play eve, who will be paying for these 12+ accounts with PLEX rather than dollars. 
---
da
---
I lost two capitals along with my two ear drums. 
---
P.s. not really he was awesome during it. 
---
I think they could. The sites aren't gated, and if rorqs could mine the other events then yeah. The only thing is the sites have had very little ore for me (running them in lowsec) and a solo barge could mine it all in a couple minutes. Far less than 1 rorq siege cycle. 
---
The issue is more that hel's for example have a 98% kill rate that means for every 98 kills 2 hel's die.
---
The issue isn't that everyone uses supers the issue is that supers are a literally i win button. ( that has a 2% failure rate ). 
---
Skins are ugly :( And the ticket lootbox is not something I wanna support. So this event is a no no for me. 
---
In the fitting window, the button on the left side near ship skins. That button opens up item browser, from there you can type and search to add modules, drones, ammo, etc. 
---
When adding modules using the fitting simulation, If you mouse over the module, the fitting sim will reflect stat changes without actually needing to fit that module. 
---
Handy for me when I'm trying to figure if I've fitting room for whatever module.

Get really good at flying that desi and frigates first. 
---
Session timers next please. They feel awful
---
Do you need to swap ships in station and pick up your other clone in the nearby citadel before you join fleet and undock?  You probably want to leave your current clone in staging too.
---
lol, I hope you like eleven session timers that take 10 seconds each. 
---
Is this actually gonna get maintained though...
---
The BS has been patched.
---
can you stop trying to link everyone to your stream, kthx
---
LOL
---
You know they used to be significantly longer, right?
---
Then I would recommend Looking at which Group own which NPC Space , the only one I'm aware of is Sansha Space and its owned by russians . I do believe a  Big allaince owns the Seprentis one and another group owns the Ore space 
---
But only for QOL things.
---
&gt; People don't feel safe with a neut in local and will quit? 
---
The smaller entities definitely dont feel safe, which leads to big donuts. Also its not just a neut in there, it's a potential of hundreds of neuts.
---
I can admit that camping may take some effort. But preparing a counterdrop is vastly more effort, considering the camper might not even be awake at the time. The game is played entirely by the rules of the camper. A group might prepare a bait a few times, but when the bait and the drop never align, they're gonna lose the will to organize (which is already difficult for smaller groups).
---
I would prefer some other harassing mechanic replace cloaky camping. Something that isn't as instantenous and unpredictable as a cyno drop. Maybe show name in local when gate cloak ends or add some other type of delay.

Fair enough.

because the sheep are too content with the skins being fed to them... it's all over... doesn't matter what you think, doesn't matter what I think CCP won't topple over because there are enough sheep in the stalls to keep them afloat for a long while.

Only reason I havent done missions because I didnt want to ruin my standing with the other factions, so to me keeping a balance between all races seemed a bit of a headache, not sure.. The problem is, with the cheaper ships the content I can do feels so limited, unless I'm playing wrong. Ive wanted to practice with lower tier ships but the problem is I dont know how to approach that idea, like what ship to go for and what activities to do with it to practice/learn
---
It would give state change timers a whole new use.

why do you delete your post before I can review my master plan.  
---
I, RMT?
---
I basically never watch streams. What's a good one to watch?
---
Exactly. You've been noted as one of the few smart guardians here among the troll of muppets.
---
Have you fought against NPCs before? Their tackle frigs are nasty, they warp at 0 without probes(!) and are really fast with locking and tackling. And they use swarm tactics. Unless I'm mistaken, Rorqs aren't prealigned when mining, so warping out would be difficult. Carriers and supers could probably get away, I haven't seen rats dropping bubbles yet.
---
Or you could detect for it and ban them???
---
Sorry I don't play the game how you think I should. 
---
I'm enjoying the event today anyhow. 
---
I think the worst part is that even with all the deaths there is no loot

That's more than a 1/4 second per client. Absolutely doable, not even really into muscle memory territory yet.
---
It's complicated, like everything else in drones politics.
---
Rumour is CCP Mannbjorn was also heard telling the lead game designer he "doesn't have the balls" to delete VNIs and bots.
---
insurance pays more then brokers fee and taxes remove
---
they tried to remove them with citadel. it broke shit. the session change is as mandatory as downtime.
---
The spawns are random in every room, so no eve-survival type guide. I've noticed personally that certain kinds of ewar are more common in higher tiers but I can't say if that's just my RNG or an actual thing.
---
T1s and most T2s are totally doable in a pretty standard RLML Caracal with tech 2 fittings so I'm certain a Nosprey would be fine for those, T3 might get a little dicey depending on spawns.
---
Best way to figure it out is just jump in honestly, 30-40mil isk caracal in t1s to learn what the rat prefixes do if you wanna keep it cheap.
---
Fuck twitch
---
Almost lost my Paladin to the site.  Thought I can get away with not changing damage types.  Once the carrier showed up it was time to go.  Finished it with a carrier.
---
If you want local, go to low sec around caldari space and look for gas sites. Profiteer nebulas that spawn golden cytoserocin. 50 mil/ site
---
&gt; The spawns are random in every room
---
but there are "presets", like there can be a three damaviks spawn "preset", but they can have different prefixes/ewar. i'm mostly interested in those "presets"
---
I mean I won a fight that both parties consented to. Their KoS list is touted as being for people who gank and violate Provi rules. They aren't supposed to set KoS for faction warfare.
---
They're basically there to make sure that everything happens in the right order, and is \_finished\_ before you do something major to your session. So you don't, for example, undock after changing your ship, and find yourself in your pod, along side your ships, because the 'get into ship' action wasn't complete. 
---
Should have been a Venture.
---
&gt;How will it work?
---
&gt;We aim to update CCPlease roughly around once a month as we make progress on projects and add more information on both ongoing and new efforts.
---
So they're going back to doing dev blogs again? Neat I guess...
---
So you want 28X2X2=112 actions in 10 seconds before it is ***suspect***? 11 actions per second? that's 660 apm. Dude, considering average professional apm is 300-400 and might raise to 500-600 during ***intense*** points in battles, you ARE talking about Korean champions.
---
There you have it folks, Excavator deployment is right up there with the most intense battle sequences during e-sport championships. Cause what do you know, Eve players are right up there with the best e-sport players. Especially the ones mining. In Rorquals.
---
You can do that with both the old and new JB.  That hasn't changed.  
---
What has changed is that in order to use the old JB you had to be free to warp.  Not pointed or bubbled.
---
This meant that that if you really want to slog down a fleet trying to use JBs, you sling them off the JB, same as you would now, and as they make it to the JB, decloak a dicter and bubble the JB itself.  If the fleet doesn't have smartbombs, then each bubble is a full two minutes of being unable to move forward.
---
This is no longer the case.  Once the fleet reachs the JB, they're gone.
---
Stop complaining when I started Eve they gave us an Ibis and a "good luck" and that was the extent of it. 
---
WHY??????????????????????
---
uuh, my same account characters all have very different overlays
---
What is a shield slave? I see the term a lot but don't recognize it
---
Lol, savage. 
---
tiericide was abandoned 
---
Die things like filters, tabs and columns yes. For things like colours and which colours to display no, those are account wide. It's quite annoying. I tried removing the green corp member color for my npc corp scout alts and the other chars on the same account had that dolor disabled as well. :|
---
I get what youre saying but we are talking about the same two actions being performed in sequence. How fast can you alt tab and delpoy drones. Hes not deploying and sending the drones to an asteroid.
---
Don't get me wrong, it's not the blobbing itself that irks me. It's just that (imo) retarded phrase people seem to use whenever they blob someone that takes fights outnumbered. I can hear you think "my FC told me to jump a cyno. I killed a super!!!" from here

Sounds like CCP might be trying to offset the massive quantities that came into the game in earlier events.
---
Got a 4 bil faction mod, so worth it for me :)
---
It's kind of a hack.  And even if it needs to stay, it's been applied pretty liberally.
---
Even cutting down the time more or cutting down the instances where it's needed would be helpful.
---
Jumping between clones in the same citadel, for instance.  Do we really need a session timer there, or can it be eliminated with a bit of work?  And why does docking need a session timer at all?
---
Posting the same thing over and over is still a thing.
---
CCPlease, i like the initiative but they seem very general. There are hundreds of bugs. Several game breaking. Dozens of initiatives that have never been completed.
---
If we actually put the initiatives you've started into this tracker, it would be incredibly long and show how much has been left incomplete.
---
I love these unitless values
---
fucking ccp

You have to blow up those minerals to keep the Rorqual Powerhouses PLEX-subbing ... mkay ?

Seems to be a few problems with decimal points over there for this event.

TI DI pls it completely ruins fleet fights and made me to stop playing

Good luck pulling that off in under 10 or so seconds tho.

Not much of a leak when its on the launcher...
---
They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks, but you can give it good scritches
---
I remember last event when there was a bug in the beginning that let them drop extra loot, and folks in USTZ and AUTZ were upset because “nothing ever gets broken to our benefit in our time zones.”
---
Here you go. Congrats, you didn’t die to the BS Dread bomb bug. 
---
The joke is that we've been asking for this stuff for months, if not years ;_;.
---
Those BS could have been rolling battleships used to close the hole.  While they might have had drones and/or smart bombs, they probably wouldn't pursue you.
---
tried couple of the new sites in low-sec, 2 gilas couldnt break the carrier in a reasonable time. Guess I'm just passing this event as well.
---
Almost forgot we were recommending things for newbros. Yes, salvaging wrecks can be good ISK in nullbear space.
---
This one will be tough - will just be back from Iceland and Florida for work. Unlikely I can get a hall pass. 
---
Implants for raw shield HP, like Slaves currently do for Armour
---
Just cause it's illegal doesn't mean it's wrong. In Kansas it's illegal to throw snowballs. See how that goes? It's subjective. You are trying to push your values on me and them. 
---
I reported every bot I found when I was in goons I dident give a fuck. 
---
I used to do a bit of regular mining-barge mining on a single toon, then doing L4 missions on one toon while mining on a second.  Finally mining on two toons, again just barges.
---
The benefit to mining is you can do it while also doing something else, it's not like you are staring at a single laser doing it's work, you are looking at the second monitor and occasionally dropping off/compressing ore.  It's not all that different than VNI ratting.
---
Literally?
---
The bonus is fixed, only the duration is influenced by the biology skill. It's actually quite simple: take the attribute increase x1.5, then multiply by the duration of the booster in minutes
---
You really should calm down, miner.
---
But how do I calculate the SP gained from the duration with the increases stats?
---
\&gt;Goons  
---
\&gt;Not botters   
---
Pick one.  
---
Wait a min, how about your rmt ceo mittani, who was reading irl money for book on kickstarter? Where is book and where is money?

simply took away the only good reason to do these events, So I'm not any more....
---
Null-Sec, Many new players get their start following carrier/super ratters.
---
ohh no our bots didn’t dock up because local was broken. rabble rabble rabble free shit. 
---
Skill-points are gained via the following formula:   
---
Primary Attribute + (0.5 \* Secondary Attribute) = Skill-Points Per Minute  
---
It's half that if you're and alpha account.   
---
Thus, anything that boosts attributes boost SP gain. A +4 implant on the primary attribute gets you 4 more SP per minute. 
---
*you’ve just had your arm blown off*
---
Ha! You think that’s bad, I lost 3 arms and had burns on 110% of my body!

This is how you sound

You can turn down faction missions to save your standings

Feature
---
Can't trust other players. Can't trust yourself. Can't trust the game notifications either 
---
They fixed this for you before 2010 at least, when I first started playing. It has always been character specific for me.
---
did it get deployed?
---
Maybe try to read the mission briefing first.
---
I love the fact that the guy saying the battleships are okay is named Sledgehammer.
---
ah yes, lets give alpha toons capitals, then i never have to pay for this game ever again 
---
Indeed, this is absurd, given the amount of ore one site contains.
---
I see.  It has been a while since I looked at siege and bastion module stats.  I thought it only gave ewar resistance and a tank bonus.  Is that the bastion module I am thinking of?
---
Exactly! It was so infuriating... And on top of that they made the ores and refining of said ores extremely limited... Driving the prices for accelerate painfully high --"
---
But this is the right way to fix the in game balance!
---
The price of minerals has dropped to 50% of what it was a year ago today. A retriever used to cost 30 mil 18 months ago. This winter it dropped down to 16 mil. Thats the case for almost everything in game. The cost of mining has dropped so much, its not even worth it, unless you're a bot or a volunteer miner. 
---
Yes please, I'd also like some SP. :) 
---
That's assuming people bought insurance for their blingy pve ships. I've never done that
---
Everyone already knew about this, my dude
---
this is my train of thought when i run high sec sites, even though i'm only making like 2 mil at most for about 20 mins of effort. I like pew pewing and salvaging
---
lol. just lol. 
---
Question; can I mine this shit with t2 strip miners? If so, what crystal do Ihave to use?
---
Stealth buff, plz ignore ^/s
---
Coding properly involves making comments buck-o
---
Ah, I see. So slaves are implants that give flat bonus to armor HP. Didn't know that either, thanks! Are those the norm for armor PvP?
---
yes and none
---
Had my graphics set to low, clicked show info on the basic accelerator bpc and it messed with my graphics settings somehow 
---
No joke, when I first read the term "shield slave", I thought it was a dedicated logi alt.

A decent direction to head for single player income is incursions. It can be truly mind numbing however.

To be honest, if you can find a corp that has a moon and are able to arrange to mine when the belt spawns, you can mine once a week for an hour or two and have enough for nearly all your T1 needs, and still have some leftover for production for side isk.
---
If you're just mining hi-sec ores, and even most low-sec, imho, there are better ways to spend your time.... even hi sec mission running.
---
But that's my opinion.
---
BTW, looking for moon in Essence region I could hit every few weeks. ;) Hit me up with details. Would potentially be willing to barter for access.
---
Probably not.
---
Don't join large battles :)))
---
It took my 2300 dps thanatos 4x rocket barrage reloads to break the tank of the carrier rat. That is way too long imo, im skipping this event or waiting till ccp fixes.
---
&gt;What could they possibly gain from exploding a 50m ISK ship? Tears?
---
Tears are not the only motivator for attacking non-pvp ships. I daresay that's not even in the running for most players (such as myself). There is a rush involved in the hunt, and no fight is a guaranteed win, mission ships are often fit for max tank and gank, making them often juicy but dangerous targets.
---
Realize EvE is a PVP game at *every level*. You're never going to be 100% safe, and lowsec is the most dangerous area of EvE, because there's little-to-no diplomatic agreements protecting residents from roamers, and much less available intel. So while I would say use the advice other people have given you, the biggest advice I can give is *adapt to the game*. If you want to run low-level missions in lowsec, go right ahead, play the game you want to play, but realize that in EvE, you're ***never*** guaranteed the safety to do as you'd like without interference.
---
Wait seriously? Doesn’t that make botting even lower risk lol what the fuck
---
and minning with neutral in local? lol kek
---
Situational - they're nearly mandatory for armor supercapitals (it's percentage bonus, so actual ehp gain is huge on these ships) and are quite common for heavy armor fleets in lowsec (link ships, sometimes T3s or faction battleships). They're definitely not in common linemember use.
---
BS dps sounds about right.
---
I wish they still just dropped boosters.  Way less fun having to build the fuckers. just not worth the effort.
---
When they're done with everything else.
---
Also, "Eve is forever" as stated in the article.
---
Eve Uni’s page iirc has a breakdown on what the types mean. I think Suitonia also published a guide that shows this in detail as well.
---
Cool, thanks for the info. I mostly fly shield ships, though I do explo in an Astero - guessing those wouldn't be of great use there? (Not to sidetrack but - if not, are there implants that make scanning sites easier?)
---
I think that having a "main" isn't the worst thing, especially considering that it's most likely your "mains" name that people identify you by. 
---
F.e. Joel is and will always be who i am in eve. It's very similar to having your own brand i guess.
---
If you're memeing because you think I don't think we should hunt down bots in alliance with a passion - you've got it wrong son. I want to shoot goons more than reds and bots piss me off. 
---
There's no risk of "goonfucking" CCP doesn't ban people on a whim unless there's conclusive evidence they are botting. 
---
Somehow I fully expect 64-bit rollout to go as option to switch to 64-bit -&gt; 64-bit as default with option to switch to 32-bit -&gt; 64-bit only, and that spread across very long time. It's similar technological jump to Trinity graphics engine introduction, and IIRC it took about 2-3 years to fully phase out old engine.
---
This make much more sense.  That many Leshak vs two dreads usually means dead dreads.  
---
As others have said, High Angle Weapon. They're similar to subcap weapons like Rapid Light Missile Launchers -- better for attacking things below their weight class. So if you were in a cruiser fleet fighting cruisers, you might run Medium missiles, but if you're possibly against dessies or frigates, you'd stick to rapid lights. (RLML meta notwithstanding)
---
Gila fit seems pretty standard? Vni I'd look at an omnidirectional instead of the 4th dda and a battery instead of the 2nd cap recharger I think.
---
In abyssals you mostly just need to learn which stuff to kill first and which stuff to get close to or stay away from while generally heading towards the loot and the next gate.
---
Still really need more details about which tier abyssal and what weather and what exactly killed you to be able to give more specific advice than "go read guides on abyssals."
---
If that's what you call adjusting some sliders, then yes, dev blogs again. Hopefully it'll be more than just that.

Untrue. Ships give an insurance payout by default.

---
Long wall of text. Repeated statements of compensation. The entitlement syndrome is real. You wouldn't happen to be a millennial would you? 
---
I wouldn't consider using slaves for Astero - they won't make noticeable difference while still costing significant amount of ISK. Use case for Slaves is: I am flying tough armor brick ship and want it to be even more of a tough armor brick.
---
As for scanning implants - there's virtue implant set (increases scan strength) and there are scanning hardwirings, but again - it's significant investment for some gain, it's situational whether it's worth it.
---
Try to chronologically separate such activities. Also, eating ass while flying could make it harder for you to see your surroundings.
---
Was in comms last week, some of our guys decided to roll the static c5 to look for a fight. They roll, start scanning the system, one speaks up: " there's a fort in here that's reffed" awwww yeah. Checks it. It's in its fucking structure timer... coming out in 15 hours.
---
Gotime.jpeg
---
I call for a fleet and we immediately scramble for hole control. At this time (about 10 pm on a Friday night) we have decent numbers so I'm able to drop a bunch of rolling hics  through to close the target holes' static (We wanted to keep mass on our home connection light,  we knew it wouldn't naturally collapse before the fort timer went off and keeping the home connection would simplify logistics enormously) rollybois go to work, existing static closed, new static scanned and doorstopped. Noice.
---
This whole time we didn't see anybody in the hole other than a previous corp member in a scannyboi keeping eyes on the happenings, so we leave the standing fleet up in our home hole and sat down to wait out the timer. there was what looked like a staging pos online in the target hole, but nothing logged off in it.
---
Everyone was super hyped, this was gonna be a super short turnaround and as long as we could beat the (what we assumed to be there) hostile reffing fleet and keep hole control for the next 14 hours or so this might be a sweet payday. Wormhole fort kills don't come along every day, especially easy ones!
---
I decide to take the overnight FC spot, the rest of leadership for the most part goes to sleep but some hardcore nuts stayed up with me to watch the target. These guys are almost the entire reason we got this kill, thanks bros! About 3:30 am my time (CST) the enemy reffing guys log a scanner in and see our connection, get it scanned down. 
---
All of a sudden, surprise Megathron Praxis fleet! (Well, squad, 3 mega 2 praxis) we knew they would try to roll, so i ping, and my awesome bois got into position on our side of the hole after their scanner went back in. (Why he didnt keep eyes on our side, noone will ever know lol) I hardcore spaghetti the tactics, i shoulda had a sabre on their side and put the bubble up right before they warped, the timing on that can be a little hairy though and I wanted them to warp out of the pos onto the hole where we could actually kill them. I had boosh there, but... Yeah.
---
They warp, land at 0 on the hole, I have half my fleet (about 8 guys) take the hole, half stay on the home side. We kill 1 on our side, the other 2 are about to close the hole so my fleet jumps into target hole, their megas jump, hole collapses. We kill the 2 last rollers, hardcore fail on tackle, praxis's (praxuses, praxi...?) warp to pos and log.
---
Well, shit. Guess we do this the traditional way :/
---
Collapse the doorstopped static 4, get a new chain, put standing fleet on the new hole. (We're about 30 strong at this point including scout and rolling alts) scan down the highsec, spend the next 2 hours getting a pos set up and bringing in ships we need. I go to bed about 6 am, right as our EU guys are coming online, and they finish up logistics while I sleep a couple hours. Fort kill 4 hours and counting. Alarm clock set!
---
Wake up about 9 am. HYPE. Get online. Rest of leadership is on, hole control held, logistics hot done, reffing fleet never logged back in. Everything rikky-tik. It's incredible working with these guys, they aleays.pull through &lt;3 everyone's getting logged on, timer counting down. Let's go!!!
---
Hit the fort, no opposition, hole control did their job. Largest fleet we've fielded by ourselves, over 50 combat pilots in fleet. Was sweet. Fort dies, drops... 9 cans. :sadface: ... MOROS. ANOTHER MOROS. RORQUAL. THANNY. NIDD. O.O those 9 cans held... wait for it...
---
44 BILLION. after capital insurance fraud, excavator sales, etc. Was our biggest payday yet!!! We start looting the field, stripping/sd'ing caps, hauling assets out. And, bob above, literally in the middle of exfil... we get a fucking dynamic hs spawn in the target hole... 3 from Jita. WTF. Thankfully the original fort owners had also left a freighter in the hole, so we rushed everything out the hs, took down the pos, and closed that hole with the fenrir.
---
Was a good day. 
---
Also, asset safety was a mistake :P
---
Thanks for reading!
---
Which chip can hold the most salsa or guacamole, that is the correct answer.
---
Sorry for the vague info, with the VNI usually I have no problem, I guess I’m not familiar with the sites, there was a hub or something that spawned a second fleet of npcs after killing a few of the first ones and there were literally 20-30 of them.. abyssal, I tried t4 didn’t work out still not familiar enough, the ship runs through t3 exotic perfectly fine it’s just that sometimes something screws me up, the big ships go too far and kite me with their big ass range and my drones aren’t doing enough damage to kill it fast enough... When I think about it it’s mostly those big guys that have killed me, and the speed of the gila is dreadful. Usually I do 3-5 successful t3 exotics and then something screws me over somehow
---
Is that Shaggy on the left?
---
I love how it was released as - with those stats it was very easy to get under the guns and keep sig/speedtanking (or - for those hating anything small and fast - facetank 3k dps in a marauder or Marshal), while whatever semiafk droneboat just got utterly wrecked in few seconds.
---
I would say best parallel with sub-cap weapons would be Artillery (Projectile)? Short range, great tracking, high RoF, low damage per round.
---
So I can't mine it with the full potential of T2 Strip miners... T.T
---
I don't fly projectile guns, but I thought artillery was low tracking, low RoF, high damage? What's the other gun type that's more for sniping?
---
you mean the random loot which is the same as any other random loot you get from sites?
---
Thanks again. Yeah, back when I flew in signal, I'd do really well for a few hours and get podded in a gate camp, so I always avoided implants. I'll check those out.
---
Moon mining is the new hotness and most definitely worth it.
---
I mean it's been many years now but I started at 9 years old. 22 now. Granted I was solo and very scrub like... for a long time and played solo. At 12 ish 13 I started interacting on a small scale with corps. My god how long it's been. Typing this at the end of my lunch hour. Jeezus. Ah well. Back to it I guess.
---
I had a graphical bug too where i docked in a station and all my settings went from low to high and i wasn't able to change them back. Relog fixed it
---
My bad, I was talking about auto-cannons.
---
been running it solo in an ishtar, no problems, the battlecruiser hurts but that is what an Assault damage control is for, the battleship just keep any amount of transverse your fine, here is my Ishtar its whatever, i use this fit for c3 wormholes, 10/10 escalations and basically any combat site ever just change your hardners and drones for whatever rats your fighting, i do also sometimes run deadspace hardners it depends on where im flying...

---
The sperg is real. 
---
I guess you missed the part where I said casual? I had no desire nor the time to organize fleets or power structures. There's a reason people like renter space, you don't have to make Eve a job.
---
I'm not looking for safe space to rat, I was looking for a place to play the game I pay to play. Camped into a station for 6 months is a blast for some, plenty of time for spreadsheets, for me it just meant not logging in for a week or more at a time. At least once it was clear the alliance had fuck all idea of what to do. 
---
You were a professional fighter beating up a senior's yoga class. Once Ghost Legion left we had no experienced capital FCs and almost no FCs in general. What was left of BadFellas was a core of about 20 experienced PVPers and a whole lot of dead weight. 
---
That video you guys posted a month or so back shows three of my characters in the fight that finally broke me. One carrier, one FAX, and one dictor. Don't get me wrong, that was a fun fight, but it also proved how outmatched we were and our leadership had no idea what to do next. We didn't know if HK would always be willing to counter escalate and we couldn't rely on the overlords to come help.
---
Justify it however you like. What you did to the drone regions increased the size and potency of the various blue donuts.
---
CCP can NEVER compete with them.
---
Player buy PLEX from CCP, botter buys PLEX from player, botter sells PLEX to you via a secondary market.
---
That's how RMT works and it only works because people like you buy PLEX that way.
---
note I did relogg multiple times. still shows on other characters/account who didn't complete any steps yet
---
I think it depends on what content you want to watch.  What type of personalities you like to see out there.  There's some people that can even make paint drying fun.
---
Good luck on you journey bois... :)

" I don't expect EVE to be easy, but as far as I can see, CCP has put death traps all around New Eden with no indication of how deadly they are and is laughing as people warp in and die. " 
---
Welcome to EVE
---
CCP just needs to dumpster Plex. We didn't want those 50 Rorq alts living in Nana's basement anyway.
---
That’s fair enough man, I never meant my comment as a diss, more just how I believed it has gone missed this long. A lot of us have six+ accounts, generally I find having to tick the box once on each account less painful than to have to do it ever again. You do you though, and good catch on the t3c issue. 
---
People like GMG and others who do those sales are sacrificing a portion of their profits and expect returns in AD revenue from people visiting their site for the sale and hoping they retain customers from it. CCP sells at full price because they can, because their sales are probably still in such a high percentage they don't need to worry about sacrificing their revenue like other people do.  
---
Back during Somer-blink their plex sales were almost constant and they made their money on web traffic and slight revenue from what was left on their profits for plex. Think like what walmart does, they sell a fuck ton for a little profit vs selling little for a lot of profits. 
---
Probably why they cost 30+ billion fitted. It's a simple risk/reward situation.
---
The event is a let down.  Does not even drop accelerators, just the crappy blueprints.
---
NEIN NEIN NEIN! *
---
any movie?
---
"CCP has put death traps all around New Eden"...
---
Now you're getting it. And if CCP hasn't covered an area the player base has.
---
Its a collaborative effort
---
I struggled with a friend to bring a carrier down to get it and I have to admit we were kind of underwhelmed. I know ISKs aren't the only good reason to play but...
---
No he was not 
---
I mean, I've had a blast playing eve so far. Never seen an event like this in any game though, usually they are new player friendly so that people will want to do them. Like, I don't mind losing hundreds of millions of isk doing normal in-game stuff because I know the dangers and if I die its my own fault, really.  
---
This event seems like it would make new players (especially brand new ones) want to quit because they can't participate or just lost all their isk trying to join in the "fun".  
---
Meh, I'll just go camp some WHs in my Manticore and call it a day. Maybe run some C3s.
---
HG Crystal max tank fit Marshal with good blue pill roll was supposedly able to tank it. Quoting person who did that: "facetanking a carrier was easier".
---
Mom, I appreciate your kid wants to ‘play this really wicked cool game’, because it really is wicked cool, but not at that age. When he’s a bit older he’ll be able to make better decisions about what to say, who to talk to [you have some parenting ahead of you in that area].
---
EVE Online is not for children. It’s pretty, there’s lots of shooting and big guns, and it’s also *free*^TM, but it’s not for kids, it’s not My Friendly Pony Land. That’s just not the kind of place it is.
---
It **IS** [wicked cool](https://imgur.com/LSqxPlg) and the people are actually amazing [which is not what your current experience is], but you need to have lived a little to appreciate [all the weird and wonderful people](https://imgur.com/Z6gtyPw). The hats in that picture ARE in fact MAGA hats, but it is extremely important that you understand what the A in M**A**GA means. Context is -everything-. To wit: [this is not just breakfast](https://imgur.com/Jp13pmI), this is social commentary. But if you haven’t been there that message is completely lost on the uninitiated.
---
It’s a *fantastic* place to go, but not when you're 13.
---
Because pirate ships get amazing insurance payouts right?
---
It doesn't matter if the insurance is "amazing". It remains an isk faucet.
---
You can use it to select characters. And you can use it to do things in options, such as setting keybindings. Then you can accidentally leave it on. Which he already mentioned in his post.
---
Meanwhile, CCPs rules are not based on what program you are using. Because they don't wanna race with people outsmarting them and they don't wanna deal with intricacies of developed programs. They are based on "unfair advantage". 
---
It looks like CCP decided he did not gain any unfair advantage by broadcasting in some random sentence chat, or in his other uses of the program.
---
Its funny how you are obsessed with him tho.
---
How do I recruit that guy?

Place a bubble, chuck a mine where they'll get stopped by the bubble and boom, fleets dead cause fc fleet warped into a bubble 
---
So a stageable Smartbomb.
---
Just go play in wormholes. seriously.  there's a reason that almost every active wh group I look at has steadily rising member counts, whereas the nullblob are either steady or dropping, even with every new player getting spammed with the same "join a nullblob and go salvage after a super until your brain rots" line.
---
Go somewhere the capitals aren't :)
---
They could just change the mineral with every new event. I believe it's not that hard.
---
Pretty much, depends if its just a one time use or keeps going off for 5 minutes once activated 
---
Copy that.  I try to fly as safe as I Can.  Just annoying.  
---
it's obviously fun*isk / hr^2
---
It was bugged, now it's not. So you did make the right choice, pretty safe to run now (still decent alpha, though)
---
seems all good, no possibility of abuse
---
&gt;When I buy from playerauctions the price is like 3-4$ for the same plex CCP sells for 20 on their main site.
---
Congratulations, you just admitted to RMT.
---
The fastest way to make memes no longer funny: admitted by PR
---
Only set a minimum anchoring distance from other mines
---
Cool.  Unrelated, send me your isk and I'll double it.
---
and make it give the system lag like b-r5
---
so you want people to not siege?
---
i thought the problem was ships without siege mode being popular.   not dreads sieging to start with?
---
I don't see that flying. It would be considered a super-cheap passive way to rack up kills. At least with current Bubble/Smartbomb play, you have an element of risk that someone scouts out your trap and warps in from a different direction to avoid the trap.
---
After reading the title, and then that flavor text intro, I was 100% sure we were getting catgirls...
---
What's with the dog?
---
Dude, let me make it simple for you. What's the apm you find acceptable for a guy deploying excavators in a non combat situation? From that, we can assume that anything higher is suspect. We can also extrapolate the number of e-sport champions we'll see on Eve videos in the future. You see, applied math is simple and absolute. All we need, is a number.
---
Current smart bombers have 5 6 or 7 smart bombs all doing damage, this is just 1,it won't destroy a fleet with a single burst
---
I bet it uses scrapmetal processing again. Gonna make the yield even more abysmal.
---
Veldspar reprocessing.
---
One of the reasons they don't do this is performance issues. AOE puts a lot of stress on the servers, especially during large fights where TiDi is involved.
---
It's why they recently(ish) removed the AOE damage effect from dying Titans.
---
Then what would be the point?
---
Once absolutely everything that can possibly be fixed is fixed then, and only then, will Faction Warfare be updated. 
---
It didn't reach the goal, so they got no money. Also, even had it succeeded, that isn't rmt. That's selling a real world good for real world money.
---
Awesome shout out to the speed running community! Check us out at https://www.speedrun.com/Eve_Online  If you guys have any questions, let me know.  There are a couple of streamers that are working on runs themselves, but you don't have to be a streamer to participate!  Only requirement is that you follow the rules for the category and submit video evidence of your run!  Hope to see some new faces up there on the leader board!
---
Here's some knowledge... Eve is full of players that all play the game differently. Learn to accept that and we all won't think you're a douchebag. 
---
Hold up folks, we have a winner here!
---
It took a while to get past my embarrassment, but thanks for enlightening me. Does anyone have any experience about how the doctrine worked in heavy TiDi? Also, I'm guessing any cloaky, fast aligning doctrine with strong alpha  could work that way. Like cloaky torp bombers? Or cloaky lokis with arty? I'm pretty sure that torp bomber tactics include "warp in cloaked, align, decloak, shoot, warp off", and the doctrine suffers in heavy TiDi (cloak not activating, misalignments, modules cycling infinitely, enemy tackle moving spastically). Unfortunately, I don't have much experience with T3Cs.
---
Still waiting on that evidence of CCP falsely banning a suspected botter
---
That's less cruel at least.
---
Yes... are you that stupid?
---
&gt;next to the system owners ticker under the system names are? (the ones usually sitting at 5)
---
Thats the Sov level. Each system starts at 0. After a TCU is onlined over time the system goes up a level allowing Ansiblex,Cyno Jammer or Beacon to be 9 n oin
---
The same point of warp bubbles, to slow them down 
---
better just make them invisible

Bring back Hidden Freeman, he wouldn't of fed like a noob.

I think I would rather see CCP life-ban any account that uses any RMT services/benefits...

Resellers whole business model is undercutting the main store, they buy in bulk and likely get a better price and make a margin.                  
---
               
---
Player auctions is RMT and specifically banned in the eula, its far cheaper because when you get caught ccp put your wallet to -isk. RMT is apparently mainly from botting and hacking accounts and is bad for the games economy. No way to know how bad as its a bit like asking drug dealers for info on their working conditions.             
---

Prepare for your wallet to get nuked along with a possible ban and warning

---
Multi-frequency personal security field projector  
---
Well from your history I guess your character is barely one month old. You shouldn't even be able to afford a Gila =)
---
The problem is that in Eve bigger or more expensive is not always better. And the best skills you can acquire are those that you lern and not your character. So it makes sense to lern from the ground up.
---
As for missions:  
---
L1 = destroyer   
---
L2 = cruiser   
---
L3 = battlecruiser   
---
L4 = battleship
---
For L1/2 almost any fit will work, for L3/4 you should look up fits on EveUni or ask in rookie/corp chat
---
Abyssal is similar: If you know what you are doing you can run the L1 in 30M Cruisers [see here](https://www.eveonline.com/now/surviving-the-abyss) everything above needs more knowledge and better ships.
---
that's the representation of the community - and the bowl of dog food is that website...
---
I thought my overview had gotten screwed up.  Good to know it was just a testing fail.
---
So what was the reasoning on killing him? I imagine it's because imperium doesn't let you leave with a titan or was it just for the isk on the killboard and some tasty tears?
---
Wait? razor thinks they are still a thing?  Aww look, it thinks its people.  Hey everybody come check out this Razor guy, he thinks he still in a real alliance.
---
Waiting for Nyx Police skin to hit 6B to sell. XD
---
Works perfectly as implemented.
---
Ez how fast can you hit 2 shortcut keys 28 times?
---
My guess is faster than 28?
---
I'd wager a good SC2 player could launch drones of closer to 40 rorqs in the same time frame.
---
Just because you're slow doesn't mean other people are cheating?
---
Based on my math then it's not really worth the hassle to do these accelerators compared to just spending the money on injectors.
---
This is what happens when the risk adverse droppers can't flee to safety the instant they feel scared. At least those ships don't have to worry about fleeing anymore. 
---
Save that one. Bounty out on Raspberry Pye's nyx. Kill, it, get prize. 
---
Those aren't loot boxes. You would have to pay real world money for it to be a loot box. 
---
And the gift box mechanic has been in the game since Project Discovery(MK II), so it's a bit late to be complaining.
---
It is a bit disconcerting that CCP has a mechanic that could be easily repurposed as a loot box. It's as if they are keeping that option on the table. 
---
I don't think they will given the controversy surrounding loot boxes(and legal issues), but it would be nice to have a official stance on this.
---
Yeah that's a good idea.  The effects could be launched from a super carrier or something and they could have different types of launchers for different effects (like ecm or target painters)
---
Lol fair enough
---
It kills me having to do shit like 25 times lol, I did the overviews once &amp; backed it up so I never have to do it again &gt;_&gt; I wish they had a better sustem for that
---
did you expect something more from CCP? wait till you get the 64bit game and pray it doesn't just delete itself, that might be an improvement though...
---
Are carriers not supposed to drop ANYTHING of value? no loot box on nothing.. wtf
---
sadly they bot wont be banned , it belong to CCP , i mean goons
---
does that drop off carrier or bs?
---
oh boy what’s the prize 
---
Elite Dangerous is a good choice. Not an mmo exactly since it is sharded and can be played in single player mode but gives you cockpit combat and a really immersive experience.
---
I've heard him yell louder about smartbombs in a Red Giant...
---
this game is fuckin' trash lmao.
---
No worries, I can't keep track of half the shit in this game anyway 😂😭
---
I mean I found exploration really interesting, made me about 500mil give or take the first week of playing, but I’ve lost a lot of my cash by now haha, but it’s a lesson for me. Thanks for the info and for that link I appreciate it 
---
Have a quick glance at Dotlan and then rethink that comment...
---
Should ask this in the official botting channel in the game.
---
Did you run it before or after they hotfixed the BS's dps?
---
I paid for my ISBoxer license because I'm not a cheater.
---
If I had any complaints its that I couldn't buy a permanent license, I hate needing to subscribe.
---
And this is having never used the multi broadcasting features in any game; I find it manages my local resources and switches between the game clients better than Eve-O preview
---
That drop is grabage
---
You get tickets, then use 5 of the chromodynamic whatevers and pay 13m isk to get a random item.
---
They had roughly the same sov sov before they were evicted fron their WH and were actively partnwering with LK in Dronelands, so not sure what else changed and what should I look at?
---
http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Hard_Knocks_Associates
---
The random loot you have to pay 13m isk to get access to, after you've had to get 5 chromodynamic things which need absurd amounts of the ore to get, or you can buy them at about 1.5m/ea so 7.5m+ to get the 5. So in the end you're out as much as 22m+ isk just to open the loot box and get the actual in game item called garbage.
---
To think, you could've gotten a nice deadspace module, like a Coreli b-type kinetic plating!
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
... in all seriousness, has anybody got anything good from that yet? (asking for a friend)
---
I had the same problem. Logged in from another computer and it was fine.
---
Lol.. it's one hell of a slow blink.. it took me a year or so. 
---
You gave it up quicker than a date on prom night. This is /r/Eve
---
GSF FTW :)
---
It's from a CCP named player so what's difference if I buy from CCP on other website like markee dragon or player auctions vs actual website when CCP on main site raw dogs u while capitalist merchant gives good price lmbo
---
Just to don't perma siege, so you could have a strategic window where caps could be more vulnerable
---
you mean alts
---
since i don't have a second one running eve i'll try rebooting. thx for the input.
---
Shit. I need my pecker.
---
I did it in a Gila. You don't take full damage if you watch your transversals. Just keep angling correctly and don't let it drop below 300, or at least not much. The closer you get to it, the less damage you take. Use AB, not MWD because of sig obviously and overheat it a bit. Launch drones once on top of it.
---
&gt;The ISK per SP is roughly the same.
---
I haven't run the numbers myself, but your evaluation certainly might be correct.  Accelerators tend to be better than injectors for high-SP characters, given the diminishing returns at high SP levels, thus the market price tends to get set by those folks.  Since they've got loads of SP, they're usually flush with cash and can afford to pay more than the average new player. 
---
I mean, CCP obviously has false positives and admits it.  
---
These threads: 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7x5xrp/ccp_guard_facts_checks_mittani_about_false/
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8r96sc/the_great_trader_banpocalypse/
---
...have examples, including comments from GM Lelouch and CCP Guard talking about false positives.  There's 0 question it happens, it's just a matter of how often it happens, and we basically have no way of knowing outside of anecdotal evidence. 
---
So whats the dps now? 330?
---
So if you find a site in less frequented ends of space, there's still chance?
---
Personally, I like this idea.  I like the idea of complementing in-space warp disruption with other EWAR.
---
I don't know, nor can I predict with any accuracy, how this would shake up fleets, so all I can say is what I assume their effects would be.
---
If an interdictor can load web probes, a pack can immobilize a fleet completely.  Load sensor damp probes, and the fleet can't lock anything.  Load weapon disruption, and application falls off a cliff.  (We're leaving out jamming for obvious reasons).  These effects would be transient, however, because dictors would be that much more of a priority target.
---
If these are anchorable, they'd probably be similar to cyno inhibs now: a great idea, and occasionally they work, but mostly useless because they're so strong in theory that they're primaried.  Unless, of course, they're nerfed into the ground in the name of balance and turn out like ewar drones (EC-300 excepted).  Also, with the exception of defense (read: gate camping) and cap fights, their deployment time would make them of little tactical value.
---
Parenthetically, I'm still not sure why interdictors don't have cyno-inhib probes.  Seems like a nifty mechanic to me.
---
It's probably good that they keep the pay low and add these measures to discourage people from doing it for ISK. Making it a lucrative way to play the game would probably screw up the RL scientific data more.
---
sums up the event 
---
Assuming it's +6 to all, that gets you 9SP/min. Over 24 hours, that's 12,960SP. Increase per your Biology skill.

If you are interested in exploration and don't mind not being allowed to shoot others, I might just have the corp for you =) : https://www.signalcartel.com/

100% :) I miss the colored icons

Not only ergonomical - they also looked better imo

Especially all of the structures in the NPC regions.

Same happened after launcher. I just readded everything from personal videos and pics
---
From the bs spawn
---
He was probably too newb pawnd buttmad to utter any words at all.  haha get rekt you support fleetless super pilot trash. 
---
it's sad that most of the suggestions itt only apply to sovnull when some of my favourite battles over r64s happened in lowsec/npc null...
---
and ammo when you're doing any other form of pve is free, right?
---
well i guess if you're using t1 amarr ammo or just drones then maybe.
---
it's not like this is anything new - it's just wrapped up differently. rng loot has been a thing since before eve was even a game.
---
That's true I didn't think of that. I just calculated it for my own character that gets 400k SP from injectors.
---
If it's optional, personally I like the monochrome ones but I can understand others wouldn't
---
Ahh gotcha yeah would be nice.
---
If there were no people leaving the game due to this shit combined with some other things and if it wasn't damaging to the game ant its economy as a whole, then this and other conversations like this would not be needed and your argument would have merit. But as is in current state of things, it doesn't.
---
And same goes to you, you are not only pushing **your** values onto others but are partaking in causing further irreperable harm to the game either by partaking in this shit or defending it for most likely self interest reasons.
---
Furthermore, its not as if there aren't examples where bots and automation of various kind has ever brought down games and gaming companies in the process. The strong ones survived after suffering significant financial damage and quality loss to the game as they had to assign resources to it, the weak ones went under and have shut down either their games or in rare cases entire studios. Feel free to Google it. You'll be surprised at what you find.

This happened years ago, before NC had a dot.
---
The difference between Markee Dragon and player auctions is that Markee Dragon is a CCP-approved 3rd party seller, where player auctions is just RMT.
---
The reason that playerauctions is so cheap is because CCP doesn't get their cut of the action. What playerauctions does is the definition of RMT, and you, as a buyer, are part of the problem.
---
That "CCP named player" you're talking about is very *very* likely not a CCP employee. When you buy isk from playerauctions, how do you receive it? Do you redeem it like you would if you were buying it from CCP, or does another player send it to you?
---
Actual mad props for CCP for having worked the cat ears meme into this one.
---
Least he can do is get some better material.
---
Better set up your twitter bot that posts with #ccplease every hour
---
And the launcher.
---
I'm 157.43% certain that in CCP's code going 64-bit will require some irreversible change.
---
here's here though
---
Tidi was and is literally intended to make larger battles possible, imagine being this thick
---
greenmangaming is not RMT. they sell official ccp gamecard codes.
---
Why are you even posting here if it’s so trash?
---
How did you make the isk?
---
So... in other news, I just exchanged 5 Chromodo-dads, 1 ticket, and 13 million to get crate. I opened the crate to reveal another crate with a chance at 9 boosters. I opened that crate and got 1 dose of some 5% boost that last 30 mins... which currently goes for... wait for it... 836,000 isk. 
---
Totally worth it.
---
One solution. Unsubscribe, stop logging in and in your reason for leaving put 'fuck you CCP, and fuck Pearl Abyss.'
---
We can make them pay, literally for their arrogance and for using events to slowly slip in their lootbox bullshit.
---
Forget bashing a monument, just stop playing the game and maybe they will get the fucking point.
---
Honestly I wouldn't really give a fuck if it meant they could hire back more community team.
---
r/eve or not, I’m not emotionally invested in this guys rig fiasco to sperg. Which is my usual state..
---
Isn't that considered gambling?  And lootboxy?
---
I opened 1 loot box and got a 17th tier OSE. But it cost me 25m to open it in null.
---
They should add a timer for how long it's actually used. 
---
I'm going to say 6 months. 
---
But muh grimdark!!
---
Oof
---
You have to understand that most devs at CCP are very slow, mentally...
---
Found the german.
---
Pussy

\*log on to my 15 Rorq Goon broadcast-input accts\*
---
"I'll save us guys"
---
Lol. Watch his character for a ban 
---
Typo nazi spotted 👀🧐
---
where are you seeing dreads perma siege?
---
i rarely see or get to do more than 1 cycle.
---
and thats if they even get used at all. the fact siege traps them means they usually just used for suicide rolls.  and carriers/titans/super carriers used because they don't get trapped for 5 minutes.
---
dreads don't get that option, their dps is at best destroyer levels unless they siege.   and they don't get resists like bastion mode.
---
they vulnerable when sieged period.
---
Haha stupid noob bee man suffering from trimark illness. Does not understand the power of FAST. Don't need tank if you can't get tackled.
---
I opened 15 boxes to see what I could possibly get.. got around 150mil worth of “garbage” you do the rest of the math
---
It's a sandbox my dude.  He can play any way he finds fun.
---
tracking is rad/sec i believe
---
Evemail them to yourself.
---
... would u really want to spend 8 days training for T2 Amythistic Crystallite.. Crystals?
---
Usually they tell me to warp to a planet then the guy ejects his gnosis and the gnosis has my plex sometimes they just contract directly or tell you to out up a item for plex contract 
---
no u
---
I have no idea, as far as I know falcon never said what happened.
---
NOT MY CCP
---
Hecate, because you can shred small stuff up close and running from anything big is easy. Just keep an offline cloak in the utility high slot for if you get chased while you still have a timer
---
See, now I think you're just trolling.
---
Honestly bugs/mistakes like this are funny enough that I can't even be mad
---
Keep digging, dude.
---
Solution: Figured out i could still click the rewards eventough they were invisible. spamclicked it until it claimed the one mission i did complete. it now has reappeared. 
---
I'm using minimum settings on a pretty old laptop, no graphics accelerator. Today when smoothly running a t2 abyss the screen went black for a second, and came back at 10-12 frames per second. The room was pretty busy, with 3 blue/orange clouds - perhaps some threshold was triggered. The graphics looked nicer than they did before. 
---
Checking my graphics settings they were at minimum except one (texture?) which I moved from medium to low. It didn't help much - the frame rate only improved after I cleared and left the room.
---
It's legit, the gnosis is the most common method for things like skill injectors. 
---
It looks like CCP is attempting to learn Gantt charts.
---
Blondzy babes, as part of our deal you're coming back to us, so get hyped for Wilmore no longer killing your VNIS! :)
---
Regular ass VNI with 100mn prop and heavies.
---
Every time they try to remove some bit of POS code weird things happen. I suspect it's got tentacles in everything...
---
..but that's two pictures
---
Right, is the important part the surface area? Is the goal to maximize dip delivery? Or just how big of a chip we can get? Or is the like Apple and CCP only approves certain chip sizes to maintain control over the user experience?
---
Oh, I believe that. I just don't believe that anybody is stupid enough to RMT that obviously, and be this vocal about it.
---
Sums up all these events smh
---
Wish I could choose what character gets the sp, most of my high sp ones aren't the actively training one anymore.
---
Lootboxes with garbage in them. What exactly is new about this?
---
Isk sink and intelligence check?
---
This. Still don't understand what the bars are supposed to be
---
Well, they spawn plex from nothing with a button press, so I am pretty sure they can compete lol.
---
Blistering.
---
Did... did you just confess to participating in RMT as part of an OP in a Reddit thread?
---
People bitching about not being given enough free stuff always grates.
---
"Still very low apm needed"
---
"Could just cycle alt tab, alt q, alt w. Literally just spam the buttons. Four keys if you add in a key to cycle up the core."
---
If we call Alt Tab one input, Alt Q one input, and Alt W one input, and the core start one input that is... 4 inputs, times 28 Rorqs (112 inputs) in 10 seconds (11.2 inputs per second) which is 672 APM (11.2 inputs per second times 60 seconds).
---
You called 672 apm very low?
---
They've never really done good damage out of siege. Solo dreads like moros was a thing (especially with drones) but it was more for the tank it couldn't really out damage RR. Siege mode is a huge increase to damage and as others have mentioned they basically do no damage without being in siege mode. 
---
Bastion doesn't increase damage but does increase range afaik (have quite eve atm so can't be assed to really check :P)
---
The CCPs in rookie chat just after reset said the battleship was overtweaked on dps. I don't see the point in bothering until fixxed
---
Wait, so people need to eat the current sites to end it?
---
Chu chu 🚆
---
How about capital bombs. Bombs that take a bite out of blobs of caps, forcing them to spread out, but don't apply to subs much at all.
---
WOA, you are clueless, if you think that is how a bot works.... WEW.  
---
I have a massive amount of experience botting Diablo 2 and Final Fantasy 14. I have helped write entire frameworks for botting. If you think running a bot is that simple you are VERY mistaken. Tons of updates and changes need to be made within the bots code almost weekly. Basically anytime the smallest thing changes in game your bot is broken and needs to be rewritten. 
---
&gt; Usually they tell me to warp to a planet then the guy ejects
---
Suddenly, a wile troll appears. ;)
---
i just have constant socket closes in only eve
---
been there, it sucks. you should keep a back up of your overview though. deosnt help with window/neocom layout but it saves you the time of making a new overview
---
BuT iUsE a BaStIoN mOdUlE
---
Don't feed that tiny dick troll
---
RMT sellers do get life-bans from CCP, RMT buyers usually get a warning the first time.  The problem is that RMT sellers just reset their VPN and roll a new account.
---
some graphic settings get activated radomly, got jf jump animation on lowest settings. 
---
instandly banned in belgium.
---
CCP really pushing this abysmal content hard.
---
No... But if they actually made it this ore is a variant of existing ores and allowing for same crystals, then yes! It would be fucking glorious.
---
Tapi cultist tell themselves it is "fun" , but in reality they know pgl will brigade their karma if they don't toe the line.
---
what it drops this year?
---
if those beliefs are stupid...
---
Talk about double standards, jeepers.
---
whoosh
---
looking at p3aks alliance history, looking at your posts....
---
:MEGATHUNK:
---
Lmao“whatever’s left”. We are dead and basically disbanding.
---
As someone who did it too, congratulations :D (though it was the longest month of my life)
---
Now you can run Synth gas reactions.
---
&gt;fewer bots in EVE
---
by % playercount? doubt it
---
Easily 
---
"Asps, very dangerous. You go first."
---
Is this EA Sports?
---
Protip: A2-V27 is the safe HED-GP alternative
---
Have you tried a VPN? I think Comcast was messing with my traffic back in the day, causing socket closed errors. Been using a VPN for years now and almost never have connection issues.
---
Ok so no event roaming tonight then.
---
another event in line with what CCP  is best at:shit content
---
I like this kind of lore. Implies that it is actually space politics all the way down.
---
but.. they did
---
On the other hand it's a very minor inconsistency that effects very few people and would take significant development time to rework the way this warning works across the entirety of the fitting system possibly producing other unforeseen bugs so the decision was made that they currently have better things to spend development resources on.
---
CCPlease can we have a green and yellow "John Deer" skin for the VNI.
---
Corpmate of mine got a 1000mn Domination AB
---
Nope. taking the current Jita sell, 43m it works out to 1.658 isk/sp, vs an injector at 1.708, and your injector at 2.135.
---
Folks getting 300k per injector are looking at 2.846 isk/sp 
---
Thus far they are cheaper, still way over priced for +6s. 
---
I think the frustrating thing about this event, and the last one, is that it is needlessly convoluted.  The boss rats drop tickets, and for every ticket you need 5 units of the chromowhatever mineral plus 13 million isk.
---
You then have to access the paradise club in the site and dump all that into it's cargo to receive the random loot box.  Like what is wrong with just killing rats and grabbing the lot they drop?  It feels like they've made it complicated just for the sake of doing something different. 
---
Mittens eyebrows are nowhere near as bad so he gets a pardon. 
---
If it's not this, I'd welcome a button coloring function, just so I could spend hours on finding the right shade of blue for my market button.
---
(Also given Eve's code, this might actually fix local)
---
[removed]
---
Yes they are.
---
Could just make it a status effect like Command Bursts.
---
I had a similar idea, but your delivery was so shitty that I'm gonna have to downvote you.
---
\^ It took you exactly this long to detect the troll...
---
It's very unclear but to me, for a time in the past, as of does mean at. If they meant what you think they mean they should have used 'from' or 'since'.
---
Why haven't you deleted your account yet?
---
Yeah let's go back to a black screen and waking up in your pod after a hour
---
Unfortunately they're not in the item browser in the fitting window for whatever reason, so I believe the answer is no. The best way is probably to use the global search bar (top left) and type in the name of the T3C, which will produce a list of all available subsystems for that T3C class, such as this: https://imgur.com/a/ItWUGB1
---
But if you want my advice, just use pyfa for this, it's simply a more powerful, more accurate tool and that's especially important when theorycrafting strategic cruisers. 
---
We need to gank her
---
I did look that one over and it looks fun except I hate the ship design (nitpicky thing, I know, but still). I would love if they introduced a new ship class in eve or something to that effect that delivered that type of experience, I just don't know how it would fit in. 
---
mail a copy to my alts every few months
---
Why do you need 10 accounts? To farm isk to pay for them?  I have 3 and that is more then enough with alt characters and such.  Sure i could see having a couple more.  Maybe consolidate some of the characters onto other accounts.  
---
Haha, and there are people that are upset that it has any of that info at all...
---
You can always go to their website and check it out.
---
I would not mind this.
---
so much game lag and client glitching today - other stuff and home connection seems fine though.
---
Nothing outstanding in the network monitor or w/e but feels like packet loss.  
---
You’r not using real money.
---
:blyat:
---
Just say you going to store to get some Milk/Eggs and then be gone for like 6 hours...
---
who cares? buy skins!
---
Intuitive...Eve...CCP...?
---
Влин сука
---
This was a test to see what would happen once they release a Triglavian dread.
---
K
---
Bounties on the rats would help quite a bit.
---
projecting insecurities and defending a shit game in 5 words... impressive!
---
.......I think you missed the joke 
---
Since you can use real money to buy Plex, and sell Plex for ISK, real money -&gt; ISK has an exchange rate.  So in a roundabout way, you're using real money.
---
I dont think so, subjectively.
---
Too bad they will be re-released. 
---
Thanks for the correction. And sorry for your loss.
---
&gt; I know. Who wears a monocle without a greatcoat?
---
I don't understand the down votes. Cypeth stated his opinion in a well worded and thought out manner. Disagreeing with an opinion is not a good reason for down voting.
---
there is no one left in PL to leave, there, your mind is changed
---
Thought for a second there that you're poking fun at the chat servers being broken again... 
---
Unlike the missing zero on the Battleship turret cycle time, this 0 is intended.
---
Retard alert 
---
there is a lack of something . . . .
---
WWWWWWHHHHHBBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
I'm sure CCP is able to make an infinite horizontal scrollbar to keep us updated on their progress timeline.
---
Yeah, as far as I know there isn't a way to put that experience in eve. The game server has a full 2 seconds between ticks so any fast paced combat is impossible to pull off properly.
---
It’s good your wrangler put that in to alert people when you type but I’m going to need you to answer my question
---
how do you do that?
---
I don't get the point of this.  They routinely invite people to their corp and then attack them?  Why would anyone want to join?  For that matter, why would anyone ever interact with them in any way?  Do they just randomly betray their own corpmates?
---
#DISBAND CONCORD!
---
This event is fun to do. It's remarkable that they would fuck up the reward system and structure so badly this time.
---
mix of station trading, mining, exploration... rl work - eve work, repeat.
---
There is 1 guy not working on the skins now .......
---
If they had a shred of smarts and this sort of ill intent...  Should have conned him out of the ship.  Probably too high level for this sort though.
---
I actually like some of the skins. Bright color skins are generally rare imo. I like the Tornado skin in specific atm.
---
i'd like that
---
when you are in space, at the bottom of the ship's HUD you will see a small "options" icon just a little lower and to the right of where your velocity is posted . Just pick "enter moving mode for messages" drag where you like and press the x
---
Honestly if they trolled us a bit with that site I’d count it great content.
---
Angel rats use all varieties of projectile ammo.
---
Gist Cherubim fires Emp.
---
Gist Seraphim fires Phased Plasma.
---
Angels are basically omni.
---
I haven’t played in for at least 2 years now. I miss eve but I’ve heard nothing but negative stuff about everything that’s come since I stopped playing. Not to mention the whole thing about chat still being broken
---
I went into a "VIP Gala" and left with a shade of hull. Apparently if you're going to crash that party you should bring some beefy friends. 
---
Perhaps, but you aren’t using RL money for them
---
how long did it take your 2000 brain cells to think that one up? and where is your bussy picture?
---
Gee, it's almost like people saw this coming because CCP doesn't fucking test shit.
---
Well that escalated quickly.
---
I'm pretty interested in Abyssal speedruns. That sounds really cool. I'd probably run an alternate category for Alphas and/or low-costs for more accessible competition outside the main Eve playerbase.
---
Sounds like an isk draining activity 
---
😢
---
Best company.  How in the actual fuck can everything released be broken, esp when it's something this important?  QA teams are so 2001.
---
yusssssssss
---
Confirmed, all 35000 members are botters. There’s a special botting package under every new member’s seat straight from the standing desk of Lord Savior Mittani (pbuh)
---
I brought my Covetor out to mine after the site was finished. I mined 2 sites and got 2496 Amethystic Crystallite  from each. You pretty much need to mine 26 sites to get 42 units worth of tricarboxyl. 
---
What's the significance of this post? 
---
How the heck would you do that though? It's not you are asking to go for a test drive in it.
---
Next event we'll be bashing structures through 3 rf timers for piles of LO or some shit 
---
Loot boxes noone noticed;
---
1. Project Discovery loot boxes; contains skins only.
---
2. NPC Mining Strong Boxes; mostly contain skins, but could also drop storyline mining equipment.
---
3. Ressource Wars LP store boxes; they contain not only the volatile Stockpile skins for the different factions, they also hold either a frigate, a cruiser, or a battleship, including fitting.
---
What's my issue with those? None. I don't have to pay plex to open them, they're acquired by a certain style of gameplay and their value is basically negligible;
---
Discovery crates give you nothing, basically, except you hoard skins.
---
 The chance of storyline items in a mining strong box is so low, that you basically come out at +/- 0 when you're gambling with them. Also storyline mining mods are too expensive for a highsec miner to be used.
---
The RW ship crates give you a ship + fitting, which is sub-par, plus a volatile skin, which perishes with the ship itself upon destruction. Every mission runner would build their own Raven with other modules than provided by the crate. The market value of that crate basically comes from the ship itself, since the crate only holds t1 modules.

---
A handy chart for comparing injectors vs. accelerators based on sp and biology skill levels
---
Buahahaha this reminds me of old 2007 missions. You get a lvl 3 mission that's completion is at 40 jumps in null sec, the mission is: "kill god". Reward is 300 trash! (This is a parody)
---
Not tried these, is this... is it PVE not entirely balanced around the Gila?
---
Surely not.
---
Lol you karma whore 
---
Yeah less materials in the game and more isk all at once sounds like a recipe for inflation
---
A new star is born tonight.
---
obligatory notice, that literally noone does abyss pvp rooms atm, so its legit isk/h
---
You do tier 3 sites in aVNI, enter pvp room, wait 5 minutes, collect 60-300mil, repeat
---
pretty sure that including the odd loss  this is better isk/h then chaining Tier 4s
---
some high end Marauder only PVE? Ccpls
---
Nah, they're miffed  that the "useful" part of the launcher has a comparatively small percentage of the screen real estate, meanwhile adverts take up the rest.
---
I'm sure most people would be perfectly content to have the ability to scroll through as many ads and news items as they want, so long as the functional essentials take precedence. 
---
Same I like the monochrome somehow 
---
And yet you both posted here as well...
---
Join a mining corp and get those orca boosts boys, I'm recruiting.
---
CCPls
---
&gt; stalk people
---
is stalking really the right word for someone reading a public post history
---
I did runescape as well. Was my first /serious/ game and I enjoyed it at that. But looking back ot was pure grind for basically no content. Eve is grind but has plenty of content.
---
I don't believe your username is "uniraver", subjectively.
---
at least the last one was a skin slot machine if you wanted to spend the time hacking for them, this one charges you to play and your reward is crap no one wants.
---
Its sad that the event is so bad there won't even be anyone trying to do it to hunt.
---
I could have sworn they got rid of the EA guy but apparently their shitty ideas hung around.
---
&gt; But looking back ot was pure grind for basically no content. Eve is grind but has plenty of content.
---
Yeah, it was the difference of the grind being the content in runescape vs content you can grind in eve online. 
---
I don't regret all of the time I spent in that game, but I do wish I quit about 2000 hours of gametime earlier than I did.
---
My god, it's like you people have never used a launcher before. What's more, there are no more "ads" now than there were before, they're just more visible because they now have graphics for the articles instead of being a text-based list.
---
EVE performance has been absolute shit for me for like a year now, after one of their patches.
---
Oddly enough, my connection in general has gotten a lot better over that year and anything non-EVE runs great.
---
" we decided to do what always works best given the close relationship we  have with our pilots – embrace the community and its creativity. " You just know they are living in a dream world where we tell them we love everything they do to the game.
---
I think mandatory mining in events is complete shite, they should make CCP employees mine ore before getting there paychecks.
---
Not to mention how horrible it is for a company to advertise its own things in its own launcher!
---
At least Somer Blink was fun.  The shit coming out of CCP these days...is not fun.
---
Thank you.
---
Scourge. is (actually was) one of the top PVP alliances in the RU segment of EVE
---
you'd think that's what the test server was for.
---
You know, with how incompetent CCP has gotten when it comes to literally anything software related, one has to wonder.  How safe are our account/credit card infos with these guys?
---
A bot can be programmed to do *anything* in a video game.  Video games are simple things compared to the tasks robots are programmed to do in factories.  It's not a useful metric for how good or bad a game mechanic is.
---
As for your personal enjoyment: that's nice.  Time to look outside yourself and accept that lots of people enjoy things you don't.
---
Or that you were around, but weren’t subbed on that one specific day. It’s just odd to pick that one date, rather than do anyone who’s been omega anytime between that date and now. 
---
There’s also no reason to restrict it to the highest sp character on each account 
---
(Tracking value \* Target signature radius) / 40,000 = tracking "falloff" in radians/second.
---
Absolutely horrendous! Imagine the outrage if Steam tried to advertise something to you every time you opened it!
---
That's still not quite true. I've seen 2-4 Leshak spawns in T3s, with all different sorts of combos of prefixes. Some of the cruiser spawns can be wildly different between goes, especially at the higher tiers. You would need a lot of very meticulous data to put together a real guide. I wish you the best of luck in doing so.
---
How is this post indicative of its death? 
---
You ok?
---
confirmed trash tier event
---
so was the concept with this event to test just how shit you can make the payouts and still have people participate?
---
i am not sure i started  around 1600 eve time 
---
I tell myself that every time I open steam, how dare they advertise games to me, who do they think they are? Oh...
---
EVE doesn't have any client-side anti-cheat, if you get reported *and* CCP can see multiple characters getting inputs in the same tick in the server logs from the same IP, you're getting banned, it doesn't matter what you're using. It's happened to people, even being really fast with alt-tab without any external software. It all looks the same to them. Just google "ISboxer round robin banned."
---
CCP does a piss poor job of securing the game from cheaters - it even gives them a convenient Python API if they know what they're doing. We have mindless/repetitive PvE content that encourages botting - VNI ratting and mining are about as fun as watching paint dry. People are awful at telling legit players from actual cheaters (as this thread proves) and the server log system is flawed and leads to false positives - no wonder alliances discourage their members from reporting each other.
---
Don't take me wrong. I'm definitely not for more invasive anti-cheat in the client. CCP needs to realise that this is a game design issue as much as it is a security/fairplay issue. Phase out current missions/anomalies in favour of diamond NPC/abyss-style PvE content that actually takes more than two brain/silicon cells to complete.
---
Making it more unpredictable is key - chaos is bot enemy #1, better than any software anti-cheat solution can ever be. Even if they just added diamond NPC assaults on mining anoms that *actually required* a small fleet to clear (of people with brains and not spider-tanked VNI/ishtar bots), would mean we would no longer see unattended rorquals botting. There is a lot of untapped potential in making these NPCs more of a nuisance.
---
Also, push more responsibility on alliance leadership to keep cheaters out and report them. With ESI tokens and all the other infrastructure; they have all the tools they need. Create a safe haven for bots - risk getting banned yourself. Anyone claiming it shouldn't be their job can burn in hell.
---
Sorry that this rant got a little bit off-topic, but almost all of this applies to input broadcasting as much as it does to botting.
---
Isn’t it kind of purple?
---
Have you seen the abomination that is blizzard launcher? They are even advertising their OTHER PRODUCTS on their own launcher! It's like literally spraying shit on your customers faces!
---
Isn't CCP owned by a Korean company now?
---
I heard Korean people love gambling games. Lootbox armageddon incoming!
---
What are POCO bashing mechanics nowadays? 
---
I shoot it to 25% of shield, it goes into RF mode for \~2 days. What happens next? How much time do I have until its repaired enough to go to RF mode again once I start shooting it? What are the best practices to take one down assuming it's RF timer happens to be pretty bad TZ...
---
I feel like people complain for the sake of it...
---
CCP WANTS those prices extremely high, if the prices were low, there would be no reason to use skill injectors during the event because the skill boosters give you more XP per isk spent in comparison. So by driving the prices sky high on boosters they push people towards spending money to buy plex to buy extractors/injectors instead.
---
&gt; or even the star gates
---
Virus that spreads itself among stargates and shuts them down for limited periods of time before moving on forcing people to take different routes confirmed?
---
in all the threads posted about this today you are the only one who seems to have gotten something good.
---
Not that I know them that well but its likely a Leader or Top FC for them.
---
It is a shift away from programmable &amp; afk'ble pve, expect more of the same in the future as CCP try to wean itself off bot subscription baseline before it OD's on spodbrain.
---
121 was my endpoint. And I still considered myself a non due to lack of content aside grind. I dont regret the time, but it was time that might have been used elsewhere.
---
Also the minerals is pretty fucked up, need 1000 units of ore to get 2 minerals. 42 minerals for the basic accelerators.
---
People offering 2mil per mineral so get accelerator or get 84mil and buy multiple accelerators or play the gambling game and try your luck and roll at the paradise. Easy fix is to reduce ore to re process to 100 to get 2 mineral.
---
I think this is actually well thought out and done on purpose.
---
1. Make an event like this so many players have to inject for mining or even start up more accounts for it. =$$$
---
2. Keep pushing so that more players keep injecting and making even more accounts =$$$
---
3. Next stage is to push them out into NS and introduce them to Rorquals and isboxer =$$$
---
4. Make sure the above players "accidentally" forget to turn off their automated isboxer function on regular basis. So that then they build more cap / super and fax alts and inject even more = even more $$$
---
Watch as everyone that is sick and tired of this shit leaves the game and come up with some new knee jerk reaction scheme to generate even more botting and multiboxing. = even more short term $$$
---
Looks more pink then purple to me.
---
Yeah let's just ignore the slower warp speed, slower align time and only 7 high slots
---
Fleet of T1 kestrels and a share of the loot , just like privateer/goons used to do.
---
&gt; 121
---
121 days or hours? I spent over 300 *days*. I can't let myself regret all of that time or I would just lose my mind.
---
I want to upvote your sadism, but theirs one thing that is stopping me.
---
&gt;ED: also fk u Dave Stark, you are famous for being an asshat.
---
Uhh, ok?
---
Sorry about being 19 days delayed. Not on reddit much. I can confirm I messed up on undock in Amarr and got nuked by Concord. Lesson learned the hard way.
---
Thought if the timer ran out before grid loaded I would be safe. :)
---
Yep, Pearl Abyss: The creators of Black Desert Online. They own CCP Since 2018.
---
Or maybe amethyst 😜
---
using Eve-o won't make you that much faster without also using hotkeys, you can see the individual drone drops occurring here over several different ticks. Is it depressing son one can go from new guy to 28 rorqs this fast? Yes. Is this broadcasting? Doesn't look like it, a broadcaster would have dropped all drones from all rorqs at the exact same time. This looks more like someone flipping through multiple screen and using hotkeys to drop drones.
---
121 combat level. Spent many years playing it into my early teens.
---
That awkward moment when you demonstrate to the whole thread that you have no idea what RMT actually is...
---
wow rorquals in delve this is dope intel 
---
Am not a chick, I don't differentiate those :( I just know pink and purple and its way too bright for purple.
---
There's these things called hotkeys and multibox software, one hotkey changes the client screen you are looking at the other drops the drones, repeat till you have all drones out, takes seconds to do once you have it setup. If this guy was broadcasting it wouldn't take 10 seconds for all drones to drop it would happen instantly for all rorqs in one tick as you can very clearly see the drones were all dropped separately. 
---
Ohhhh ok. I honestly can't remember my combat level anymore but it was maxed out except for the newest combat related skills. I think I had like 2200+ total level.
---
I still log in every 2-3 years out of nostalgia, then I click to move my character, wait the 1 second runescape-lag to see my character actually move, and remember all of the reasons why I quit.
---
If you know only pink and purple, how do you see that as pink hahaha turn off the lights maybe it won’t be so bright 
---
Give it a try. On the last event the Veldspar crystals worked. But then someone was saying somewhere that in future you won't be able to. But am not exactly sure where or from whom I heard that.
---
So best thing, just give it a try and see, if it works great, if not then not.
---
NO! It's awful. Don't fucking bother.
---
tbf that probably says more about r/eve than it does about CCP. EvE has come a long way over the past few years, not all of it good, but you don't hear much about what good stuff there is here.
---
1 key press drops drones on first rorq, next key press switches client screens, next key press drops drones on second record, repeat till all drones are out. This is what you are seeing here, this takes AT MOST 56 key strokes for 28 rorqs. The average person can manage 3 and a half key strokes a second putting 56 keystrokes in 10 seconds easily within reach of your normal turbo computer nerd. if the guy was broadcasting all drones would show up at the same time not over 10 seconds.
---
Wow you're very own Goon.
---
when are you joining a real pvp alliance like your friend here?
---
Eve has the best protips.
---
Automoderator has detected a blacklisted url posted. If it's Gyazo or Screenshot.sc use imgur.com instead. If you feel this is wrong feel free to message the moderators
---
Damage control module went from active, to passive, to passive aggressive it seems.
---
yea, launchers and ads are all the rage now.
---
At least they added the grouping feature.
---
However, I do like the idea suggested in another thread where you could launch directly into a specific player on the account. That would be useful.
---
but
---
Resource wars was SUCH A SUCCESS
---
so mining in events is OBVIOUSLY good.  i mean, you have so many people doing resource wars that you can't even get in a site.
---
*looks at untouched site for last month*
---
....yeah...success
---
That would actually be easy to do, damage could start at X sig, and scale up with the sig size going up.
---
This is terrible. You've in the most F1 mashy alliance since 2017 (lol) and you don't even have 400 kills. And you are calling me bad and lecturing me? Do you have any self awareness?
---
I think the simpler combat site format from a couple years back was much better. It generated pvp content as well.
---
Dude stop. Drone recall can totally be done by eve-o preview (CCP says this is legal), and proper hotkeys. 
---
You act suprised. For a while the only thing about events that made it worth doing were accelerators. Now that's changed as well.
---
I mean i like the communal activity of mining.  It just feels like wasted time when i run 3 max skilled miners and a single rattler can make just as much isk in a fraction of the time.  I really wanted to mine and build everything coming back to the game this time.  But i see myself buying ore now instead.  
---
Still not the correct usage of irony, you're not very bright...
---
The average words per minute typing speed for a normal adult is 38-40 which comes out to 3.5+ keystrokes per second. The process you see above when configured correctly can be done in 56 keystrokes which means even you average non-eve playing person can almost pull off what was seen. But someone who works with or on computers for a living tends to have a higher words per minute usually between 65-75 words per minute resulting in close to double the keystrokes per second for the average person. So at 6-7 keystrokes a second, 10 seconds is more than enough time to pull off the 56 keystrokes need to drop all those drones with time left over to start assigning them to rocks. just because you hen peck your keyboard when typing doesn't mean all eve players do.
---
I donoe, pink, pinkish, pink enough, whatever. Point is, still no cat ears, no whiskers, noting like that :(
---
Are we supposed to be getting those? But guess what, they’d probably be the same color too 😂
---
Gambling in EVE? *SOMERBLINK ADDICTION REEEMERGING*
---
Unfotunately probably not, though they have not been denied in any official sense. But I would fully buy some cat whiskers, cat ears, cat eyes and cat paws for some of my ships.
---
how about the CEO for the FRAT alliance getting banned for RMT?

---
I agree, i have looked way to long for my personal assets before.  
---
Legacy code
---
Sounds like they're growing increasingly more desperate and trying to get newbs to buy plex for injectors so they will mine.
---
Was listening to rorq pilots in coms this morning trying to mine a site, they decided after the first one it wasn't even worth the effort because of how little ore there is to mine and switched to using barges before giving up completely after finding out they have to pay to open loot boxes and getting jack shit when they opened the ones they had bought.
---
it's funny because of how many supers and titans snuffed left the imperium with. 
---
did you hear that, /u/WTB_Killmarks? you're on the blacklist, buddy. or does the rule only apply when you want to scam/bully a kid?
---
downvote all you want, this guy is seriously next level impressive
---
there's no point you can strip the sites with 1 or 2 unboosted barges in a few minutes and the payout is complete crap.
---
that takes effort and the pay out isn't worth it.
---
being able to afford a titan is the exact moment you should leave for somewhere more fun
---
Found the colorblind.
---
Who cares? It's not like the bots get tired.
---
I went to a site and it gave me a shiny golden ticket and I was like "woo what is this shiny golden ticket" and then I needed to mine some ore and process it and go to a place and pay some money and I was all like 'fuck that noise, eject that shit into space, fam'.
---
On a scale of 1 to elo knight, delicate space prince, I give this event a rating of Stainguy.
---
pretty sure they was a way to block URL's but i might be wrong, elseway do it in your firewall vOv
---
I agree, the old blood raider events with a simple site with a gate or two, in each system, that people could hunt or farm as the pleased was much better.
---
This doesn't fit the narrative. I reject your reality and replace it with my own.
---
So as of right now its hard to run this event solo?
---
&gt;that's a dumb argument. A DD from out of nowhere would be OP AF, but it's not like supers drop put of nowhere onto your small gang. It's not like you can't prepare for that. If you think umbrellas are OP, then that's a totally different conversation to be had (I too think supers are OP. I think HAW fits on titans are OP). What does that have to do with local though?  
---
&gt;If you think the umbrella is Overpowered, then we should talk about nerfing that.  
---
&gt;If Supers and Titans could kill you from 1DQ when you enter 1Smeb, then sure, I would agree that's an equivalent example. They just can't.
---
Why dude? Just build your own wormhole you can shoot DDs out of. Players can remove them. Why would you be against that? After all you have the tools to remove them and you can make your own. What's the problem chief? Funny how all of the sudden you understand balancing when it's something that you don't like and it would affect you. Saying "well you can do it to" isn't an argument. So you're going to have to come up with something better. Thanks for playing.  
---
 Yes, because there is no need for that. Players can. 
---
Just like my hypothetical point about wormhole DDs right?
---
&gt; Because then mining would be a pointless exercise. PvP would also be pointless. Stuff needs to have meaning/value else it's not interesting. 
---
Good so you understand now that cheaper shit doesn't mean better. "But it makes ships cheaper" is not an argument either. I'm happy we're dispatching with your bad arguments one by one. I feel like we're making progress.
---
&gt; Check MER 
---
Correlation does not equate to causation. Nothing in the MER says X is happening because of Y in regards to mining causing more pvp.
---
&gt; Why do you need to have krabs being easier to kill for that? There are plenty of roaming gangs already. Somehow, they don't meet all that often. Reason? Answer this. 
---
It was your point that having easier krabs as targets would draw more roaming gangs out. There are "plenty of roaming gangs out now" has no metric. how many is plenty? Did you count it? No. You're just making things up.
---
&gt; I wish this would be true. It's just far from reality because you can have plenty of content if you want it even without PvE'ers involved, right now. However, especially the small gangs opt out of that. They don't want it. What makes you think they want to fight against other roaming gangs more? 
---
How do you know they don't want it? What should they do? Siege 1DQ with a small gang? Start taking Keepstars?
---
&gt; Where is your evidence for that? I have data from the MER that suggest that everything you say is wrong. I have my own experience which also makes me think you are wrong. Should I trust in your magical leap of faith that, without local, PvP'ers around new Eden will finally want fights they might not win 100%? Because I don't and none of your opinions will change my believes. 
---
Where is the evidence that people who are trying to do PvP want PvP? Are you listening to yourself? And your MER does not back your assertion up. Your claim about the MER is that mining causes more pvp because ships are cheaper. That's nonsense. You have zero to prove this. This is the equivalent of when CCP argued that nullified Claws were good because more Claws were used. It's low IQ circular logic. And your own experience? What experience? You're a krab. This is like deer telling wolves about wolf hunting.
---
&gt;So we get farmed regardless of our huge numbers, regardless of our capital umbrellas, regardless of alliance infrastructure like Jump Bridges, Cyno beacons, citadels etc. etc.?  
---
&gt;Yes, I agree! Noone is ever invulnerable unless docked and we are not an exception. I wholeheartedly agree. I also consider this a good thing btw. :)
---
Yes and this is a testament to the quality of pilots, not the balance of the game.
---
&gt;Then why don't they do it now? Because the evil krabs with their locals discourage them to do so? :D The reality is: krab-Ganking is the most proliferated form of PVP in Null. That's why you need more krabs out there, not less.  
---
&gt;Krabs are content generators and you don't want less of them, you want more. Why? Because PvP'ers refuse to BE content. They don't want fights one qual footings and they will go above and beyond to avoid any fight they might not win. It's so deeply rooted in EvE PvP that you can't get rid.
---
They do. But for example if you go to Delve you don't have fights with other groups. Last night we rolled our wormhole into Delve. The moment we jumped in all the Rorquals instantly drew in their drones, warped to citadel and that was that. We managed to snag a Retribution. Molok wipes into system and sets up boson on the gates. There's no content to fight. Local makes certain everyone just docks up. Nobody will actually fight.
---
&gt;That doesn't even matter one bit cause noone except us two is reading this conversation anyway, and I couldn't care less about your opinion, the same way you don't care about my opinion.  
---
&gt;I care about your arguments though, but so far, they either don't make sense or are "I feel" and "I don't like" opinions.
---
Maximum irony. You should actually roll a new character and try to do small gang. See what it's like instead of being a herbivore krab.
---
Then why even have accelerators in the game at all if that is the case?
---
I thought CCP was wanting to increase event participation. Want people to participate? Make the items non-trable, no contracts, no markets. 
---
Looks fun. Who wouldn't want to BE A BOT THEMSELVES. I mean this 'thing' is so intelligent, almost human-like. Neural Networks sure have come a long way.
---
Still get an up doot pixel art for the win
---
exactly. That's literally the only thing I look forward to on these because of my remapping it helps me skill into shit that I'm fucked on. But this is so fucking ridiculous. You need 2 accounts to even mine, and when you do mine, you get cock hair on the amounts.
---
And it's a recycled skin!
---
Sub-caps are vastly inefficient material sinks compared to a dreadbomb of PGL quality.
---
The Tornado skin looks truly fucking bad.
