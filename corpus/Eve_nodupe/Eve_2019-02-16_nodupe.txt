You got caught by something called a 'smartbomb'. It's an area-of-effect weapon and one of the very few systems in the game that can damage ships in warp (or more precisely, coming out of warp). 
---

---
Its weakness is its very small AoE (around 7.5km for the large versions) as well as being unusable right on top of a gate. So the user (attacker) has to sit a little bit off the gate and towards where he *thinks* people will be coming from - usually another gate in the system. He can't harm anyone warping in from a significantly different direction. 
---
So the way to protect yourself against smartbombs in lowsec is to simply not warp directly from one gate to another. Pick a planet that's not inline with any other gates, and 'bounce' to that first. If you can't find one, just warp to 100km and re-assess the situation from there. 
---
You can anticipate smartbomb camps in several ways:
---
* Look for suspects and criminals in local chat - smartbombers will constantly have one of those flags up
---
* d-scan the gate and look for battleships, especially Machariels - make sure you're in d-scan range when you do that
---
* if you use lowsec often enough for travel, you'll figure out the most common places where people sit with smartbombing battleships
---

Man, it's right on the tip of my tongue, there's this... thing, this object, that holds value, and can be transferred to people when they do things you contract them for. I just can't find the right word, maybe it will come to me.
---
Ugh, I've been free from eve for about 3 years now but you make me want this so bad.
---
I bought extractors today for the first time. It was magical. I have twice as many Plex as I started with. I'm never paying CCP another dime.
---
Yes some SP would be lost in the process but there isn't any other way to get the injectors except for buying them for real money/plex or buying them from other players for ISK. 
---
And i would totally play one, but to be honest i don't like flying blingy it sounds like you have lots of blingy assets i would probably not fly and would liquidate so i could throw more T2 fit stuff around instead.
---
When the client hits 88mph‚Ä¶  we're gonna see some serious shit.

What about the mod post or your experience with Eve makes you think that fairness is an important factor here? 
---
Here? Or in game? I didn't get anything here. I haven't installed or logged on in... quite a while, so I won't be able to see your pm in game until Sunday or so. 
---
im playing this game again after a break, i dont have much energy to play every day but im having fun roaming lowsec looking for fites. im trying to ditch my must win attitude and settle for "every fight is good fight" attitude instead. 
---
Appreciate the honesty! If getting someone to fly the pilots doesn't work out, I'll be in touch~
---
It's not snapped if you have planned it out.
---
It's almost like /r/eve is made up of different people who don't all use reddit at the same time.

But it's an illusion; we're really all just [one goon multiboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis).

Caldwell has a Wyvern (in GDUSK not TEG). TEG just has alts and sycophants
---
Like, to clarify, I'm not saying it's wrong to do it, I'm just legitimately curious about the reasons. I'm still fairly new and everyone tends to just sort of vomit out a bunch of "REEEE CCP IS SATAN", but it seems like few people really explain much of what the actual reasoning behind it is.
---
Back before injectors the only people who trained rorquals were very few and the most devoted to mining, which at the time was looked down on in null by many groups, some to even so far as aggressively push miners out just to kill them for content. Of those few that did train into rorquals, many went bare bones, not getting proper secondary skills up for capital flying. So if injectors did not exist when the Rorqual changes happened, the massive influx of Rorquals would have not existed right away, and damage done to the game could have been controlled. 
---
But because injectors did exist, people could just go crazy mining with Rorqual alts Day Zero of the changes. Imagine that back in the day, it was a small core group in your corp that mined and fueling the war cache of ships to go pew pew. The rate they would have done so was limited to how many clients they could run, and hulk fleets were rare outside super protected areas, so production was very limited. After the Rorqual changes with injectors? It went from a small core group to just about a good majority just mining and shitting out resources for the war cache. Supers? Fuck it why not, need to trim the max stack minerals anyway. Titans? Shit NewBro joined last night right? he is gonna need a Titan, so here ya go buddy. Gonna have a roam? ehh might as well make it a Dread bomb roam. Gotta sell these dreads somehow for iFraud. Oh crap, new doctrine change, gonna need to make 5 more dread/super alts, tell the FC I'll have them injected up by Tonight when I get home from lunch.
---
I once thought injectors would be great for the game, turned out I was very very VERY wrong. Fuck injectors. 
---
&gt; gamers for allowing this to happen though
---
I do my best to stop supporting these shit decisions, hardest one to stick by is not buying early access games.

64bits means that your client won't crash once it hits the ~3.5GB ceiling during a fleet fight, because there will effectively be no limit to how much ram the client can use. That's all there is to it. Performance difference in real world applications is generally negligible. Any graphics/settings changes would be completely separate from the 64bit client. Also, this doesn't have anything to do with the server, since the server has been 64bit for a long time. (This also has nothing to do with the single thread problem, which is an inherent limitation of stackless python.)
---
Something to keep in mind is that 64bit applications require more memory than their 32bit counterparts, due to the larger pointer and struct sizes. It could theoretically be as much as double, but probably in the range of 50% more usage.
---
But, your computer can use "more ram" than you have available at once, using [swap files](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/swapfile.htm), even though this does incur a bit of a performance penalty.
---
TL;DR: Use the 64bit client if you wan't to avoid the risk of crashing during fleetfights because of memory.
---
Humanity is weird I tell you
---
I like this idea. But people could just leave an alt in horde or something and it would appear they are active.
---

You did good 
---
&amp;#x200B;

Easiest way is probably just selling them on the bazaar, you would get about the same as if you extract them. 
---
That said i don't think anyone here would mind getting them :P 
---
hey you are watching xx
---
What, exactly, does it matter what the reason was?

Ok thank you. I saw your name and I remember when I was in dark rising federation there was a guy named Mitch Taylor. I figured if it was you I‚Äôd say hi. 
---
The community will be happy once you do. üëåüèª

Agreed. Definitely since I‚Äôm a new player, but in the 2.5 years I‚Äôve been playing my experience feels the same. I mean, I‚Äôm flying supers and shit now, but idk still feels like EVE.  And not same in a stale or bland way, but the same in that i can still have fun I guess
---
Were you able to solo a C3 site with a single rattlesnake or were you multiboxing?
---
Do you have proof?  Talking out of your ass does not count.  I know that you think you know things, but you don't.  Come back when you can actually come up with a valid premise as to this "they aren't allowed supers" deal comes from.  
---
ESO is a great game too, glad to see people playing it.  Im returning to EVE and my SP is low, so if you end up extracting with any extra to spare, my ign is Max Degaulle.  
---
Fly safe friend o7
---
Here is fine too.
---
If you want to do some research about account transfer you can read this:https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203465481-Character-Transfer 
---
basically it requires a payment of 20$ (used to be possible with in-game plex). I¬¥d be happy to cover that. As far as i know this can be done without installing the game, over the account management website. 
---
Alternatively you can follow the suggestions in the reddit thread and  receive a skill extractor and then use that to extract &gt; sell injector &gt; buy 2 more extractors...etc. But then you basically kill your character, so it depends if you hold any sentimental value to it :)

What's that new drug you kids are ingesting these days?

---
The actual number of people rage quitting and extracting (and not biomassing *hint*) is such a small drop in the ocean when you look beyond the 6-12 Redditors who've made these claims, and to the combined playerbase across every TZ.
---
  If something as pitiful as 'leaving because AT' had driven them over the edge, they were going to leave anyway.
---
I would definitely be interested in receiving whatever you feel like you want to give üòÄ. My in-game name is Jen'isand Rul and me and my Corp are getting back into the game and saving up for an Astrahus. Good luck on ESO!
---
People care about the state of the game, and removing an entire alliance from an area WHERE FIGHTING IS RAMPANT is bad for the game. Go talk to MajorJenkins and other goons that go there. Ask them whereelse they find content in Querious...
---
Hint, its in Khanid where we sometimes fight them.
---
You could just ask the person you‚Äôre planning on giving the injector to to buy you the extractor. 
---
Or you could just ask them for the extractor and then just scam them.

The members of the CSM are those who stood to benefit from skill injectors the most.
---
You don't win votes for a cult of personality with no ISK and no influence in the game.  The majority of CSM members are the super elite, super wealthy, who stood to boost dozens or hundreds of characters to titan/rorqual pilots over night with them.

It makes 100% sense that they would be for them.

I do my best

now *this* is a quality shitpost
---
I agree with jebis position. His skills have value and if ccp, which was just sold for a ton of money, and has a marketing budget, wants him to promote their game they should be willing to spend a little money on him. And on all the people who stream on their channel, if they want to be paid.
---
If some people are ok with doing it free, that‚Äôs fine, but its common decency to pay for skilled work. It‚Äôs hard to be an entertaining presenter and $10 per hour seems reasonable.
---
Okay
---
The only thing more embarrassing than this post is commenting on it.
---
Well that's not entirely true, our alliance and coalition has goals which we actively participate in and when we win an objective because our entire FC team coordinated and worked together to do so it's absolutely rewarding. Opposite when we lose the objective like last week. There are moments of try-harding and there are stakes for us too. I guess I just make an active decision to not devote my life to the game.
---
For all the hate "null blobs" get I have not experienced a more light hearted and fun environment than Imperium of which I've been a part of since 2014. We've tried renting, we've tried building alliances from scratch, we've tried low sec, faction warfare, high sec and wormholes. Imperium coalition wins, at least for the way we would like to play the game.

Thank you for this. People bitch too much about skill injectors.

The only thing that EVE had that set it apart were consequences and, and the ability to create something new and yours. The people who had the most to lose supported removing consequences to protect their make-believe internet spaceship wealth, unwittingly killing the reason their make-believe wealth mattered in the first place.
---
Assymetrical warfare doesn't work, even when you are a 1000-strong newbie coalition against 200 super - we tried that BNI. Looks like we're at the end of the line here.
---
Blog it.
---
Find out what the staging systems are in null, and then stay 6+ lightyears from them, at least then anything you find is a 5 minute mid from dropping on you. You could always just be prepared to lose whatever you drop and make sure you make it worthwhile (scooping the loot with alts and making sure it dies, maybe scanning it beforehand to see if it has juicy mods). Sort of "null-sec ganking" if you will.

Thanks. Selling them on the bazaar would require me to make another account, get paid in ISK, log in, and give it away. Based on the PMs I've been getting, it looks like they're going to be semi-extracted to help out these folks with a couple injectors, then an old vet will be taking over the 3 pilots to fly (instead of killing them because I love them). =)

People complain about every event. People were mocking devs in game during Incursion live events before the expansion. 
---
They're essentially invincible if they're under a super umbrella and the pilot is somewhere near their computer. They get a 7 minute invincibility timer on top of a ridiculous self-tank. And they mine ridiculously efficiently with Excavator drones.
---
So once you have injectors, people are injecting new characters in Rorqual pilots with the profits from selling the minerals their existing Rorqual pilots mine. You have escalating (it's not exponential, it's quadratic, but that's bad enough) profit-making until you run out of ore - which, with moon mining, you basically never do.
---
If someone records themself opening all their accounts and completing their biomassing I'll guild them.
---
Just inject into a rorqual noob

They also said we'd get character transfers for NuPlex back.  2 years later, if you wanna use PLEX for a transfer you have to make a petition and wait for CCP's customer service to actually look at it.
---
Then that alliance should not have been morons then.  Did they break a rule?  Yes.  Was it owning supers?  No, as that is not against the rules.
---
The problem is, you believe that no matter what, The Imperium should let these guys hang out.  Well, SR doesn't own Querious, The Imperium does.  This is just like Skill Urself removing renters that violated rules.  Purely business.
---
If you don't like the decision, I welcome you to either have them crash on your couch, or attempt to take back their space and give it to them.  Either or, doesn't matter to me.
---
I told you that in secret damit.
---
&gt; The difference between buying a pre-made char and doing injectors to do that exact same thing is where the money went at the end of the transaction.
---
No, it's not just that. The character you wanted had to exist, and there was a very limited supply of e.g. Rorq pilots on the bazaar. With injectors you can turn any character plus ISK into the targeted alt you want. Skill farming is a thing in a way that character farming never was.

CCP (and the fanboys apparently) don't understand that customer goodwill is a resource that depletes.  Most people's Give-A-Fuck Tank seems to have finally run empty.

Orcas are already used for AFK mining in highsec and sport 300k EHP CONCORD tanks thanks to previous buffs. Excavators have no place in highsec.

Yeah I heard a lot of mixed opinions about her but near as I could tell she always seemed like a person who had focus .. tbh there is the biggest issue as that we tend to focus on the individuals not the collective where it shouldn‚Äôt be about her but the brand ..

Game publishers like EA or Ubisoft would never get this far with the attitude displayed today .. a lot of free passes are handed out 
---
The AT is absolutely not a 1% event.  Yes, maybe 1% participate in it, but the publicity and viewers are definitely not.  Hell, I know a LOT of non-EVE players that keep trying to get into the game just because of the ATs of years past.
---
I wouldn't be able to find a character with that corp history, as I've never personally recovered any biomassed characters, and I don't know anyone who did. It is a special corp that you need to use external API tools to look at properly. It doesn't even have a corp icon, and states its size as tiny, even though Eve-Who identifies it as having over 1 million members. It's not really a corp that works like a standard corp.

I mean if someone wants to afk mine excavators in highsec id love that. A few gankalysts and those thing go boom really fast

TL;DR

Why I can't Rorqual mine in highsec CCPlz

Yeah ESO has been wonderful. Decorating my personal treehouse for the past month has been quite fulfilling.
---
Glad to see you're returning to EVE in this time of apparent crisis! I'm working out something with an old vet who is planning on flying my pilots (instead of extracting/stripping them) and a few other folks. I'll be extracting some SP (non-combat stuff like mining) and handing injectors around to those who have asked. I'll be in touch!

So then whats the issue?  Some people seems to like doing it, if you don't have many followers already then its a good way to grow your follower base, if you are already "a big deal" tm its likely not required for you.  I don't see what the big deal is.
---
Also wait a minute in your first analogy you said "if you build brick houses and you're really good at it" which doesn't really apply here since you're shit tier.
---
See some of the comments on this post. The consensus is, streaming on CCP's channel does nothing to help grow the streamer's follower base. They just subject themselves to being stream sniped far more often.
---
If CCP had a functioning brain, they'd use the features built into Twitch to host these streamers, rather than having them stream on CCP's channel. There's also the fact CCP gets any Twitch revenue while the streamer is streaming on their channel. Hosting would solve this, as well as solve the whole "doesn't grow my follower base problem."
---
But that's too logical for CCP so it's all a pipe dream.

It IS a capital in both industry and naming, just got in application.

playing around with the orca bonuses ok. nothing against that but  excavators  drones in highsec is (even in lore because, ai=evil in the empires) a no go.
---
The Orca isn't suppose to be a mining ship (and I wish the Rorq wasn't a mining ship either). It's a command ship, there for boost and "support" of the mining fleet as it, and the Rorq, should be.
---
Yeah you should probably stop trying to roast. Unless you enjoy roasting yourself.

Yes they should take a leaf out of the book of those other developers who host streamers on their official channel such as &lt;literally nobody&gt;

CCP's focus in their expansions and updates for the last 2-3 years has been on the two types of players who stay subscribed the longest (and with the most accounts) and cause them the least drama. BTW, if you're reading this post, you're probably not in either group. Sorry.
---
Those two groups are:
---
* Hard-core PvE'ers, who have seen their game play expanded beyond recognition with Lifeblood, the Agency, the new Project Discovery, the constant in-game events. Even in areas like mission-running, where there haven't been vast improvements for their game, these players have gotten shadow buffs like burner missions, and the war-dec and no-awox changes that have made their lives safer (and therefore, more profitable). And high-sec mining has received both this buff and the Lifeblood buff. The wormholers have kind of gotten the shaft but since wormholers are also drama-causers (sorry, but you are), they don't really count.
---
* Hard-core null-sec F1 warriors, who have also seen their game play wildly expanded with Citadel (a **vast** expansion to their game play, not only from the structures themselves, but the FAX and Titan DD changes that were also in Citadel), injectors, and shadow buffs like booshing, kill marks, and pirate capitals. This has very ironically given their FCs the shaft in significant ways by both reducing the number of alliances/coalitions (targets) in-game but also reducing their power and influence (given that when you have 50 supers available at all hours, the FC skill needed for success can be quite a bit lower in 2019 than it had to be in 2014), but they are also drama-causers by and large, so again, CCP is presumably willing to take that loss.
---
The other big thing that both of these groups have in common are injectors, which allow both groups to instantly skill up to any ship needed, whether Rorqual or Titan, and instantly enjoy economy of scale (by having 20 bot supers) that used to take years to acquire. And of course since injectors pour money into CCP's coffers at a rate that may well exceed their subscriptions revenue, CCP is quite willing to turn a blind eye to the downsides of this system.
---
Every other type of player -- from FW small-ganger to wormholer to low-sec pirate to small-scale industrialist -- has seen their needs ignored or at best, pandered to. They are given the crumbs at the table (low-end bonuses for industrial structures, for example) while those in the two categories above get the same benefits but on a much larger scale. This is another sacrifice CCP is apparently willing to make, though, because these types of players both stay subscribed for shorter periods and cause them more headaches than the consistent money-spinners in the first two groups.
---
So yeah, people are quitting EVE.
---
Does this mean EVE is dying? Nope. EVE is stagnant, and can probably survive in the state for years with meaningless fights and dozens of Rorquals being used to mine up the minerals to by the T3 modular super-titan that CCP will presumably be adding to the game in a couple of years... followed by the new skills to fly it and the new SKINs to make it look decent.
---
What other developer asks their community to stream on their official channel? Woops. There goes that argument.
---
Agree, they would unlikely be used in high-sec. 
---
Or people would use them and place some defense there. Which could, heresy, lead to more pvp in high sec.
---
Spent 52 million isk, 4 site tickets, and 20 ore crap (that I needed to mine with an alt, because who has mining skills?) to obtain 4 high sec crates.
---
Loot from them:
---
1x 3rd tier overseer's effects
---
1x Agency 'overclocker' sb3 dose
---
1x synth exile booster
---
1x lachesis spirit skin
---
total in game value: 5.4 million isk. 
---
At this point we should be grateful that they still take an interest.
---
No, you misunderstand. CCP dont actually know binary, they just move the 1 to a different position to change the number. so 000001=1, 000010=2, 000100=3 etc.
---
Put another way - when you count using your fingers, do you count in binary, or do you just get to 10 (in base A, for lack of a better term) and then move onto your toes?
---
Reminder that making Rorquals "worth taking outside POS shields" was a thing that the players loudly demanded.

Not the guy you're replying to, but not being allowed to take a higher gate seems like a unique trait of capitals

Some play on alts they're not supposed to disclose (though occasionally slip up), others like many here don't play at all.

looks like he's been doing small gang in nullsec rather exclusively. it can get cancer with the capital ship drops. hence wormholes are better - you can still dive in to null sec if you want.

I think part of the problem is ths CSM doesn't seem as frustrated as many of us are, and seem to sit in radio silence or meme.

fixed max amount of bpcs on the server is a way, but AT ships should be only of AT also AT ships have gotteng destroyed by the power creep, no reason to take a moracha over a loki (also more like 160 1.4b lokis)

God I wished CCP put as much design thought into their spaceships as some of these fan drawings have. I would throw a lot of money at a book of technically drawings for some of the more recently redesigned hulls.

Dark Rising was actually my very first Corp back in 2009 or so. I didn't stick with EVE at the time so I was only there a few weeks before I went inactive, but I still have fond memories of my first experiences being on voice chat with a PVP fleet...and losing rifters horribly.

Must be asking for a friend
---
Instead of introducing skill injectors they should have granted a new account or char 15-20mil DP free to distribute except on cap skills.

No mass injecting into new metas, titans or other obscenities while new players don‚Äòt have to wait forever to be useful and fly a variety of ships.

Okay but now if you want the game to grow(or even stay alive) it is going to have to adapt to people that don't want to be eternally behind.
---
fond memories, old man star era? :D
---
It can enter HS, it doesn't use capital skills, the main skill for it is Industrial Command Ships rather than Capital Industrial Ships, you can build and dock it in a rait, it can't use a jump drive. 
---
The only things I can think of that it shares with caps is immunity to command destroyer's fuckoff mod and the fleet hangar, a feature which isn't exclusive to caps. It's in no way a cap and everything you said is wrong.
---
So dumb
---
Never seen anyone ask for or want that before. So safe to bet CCP will add those before doing something silly like getting their shit together, you won't be waiting too long.
---
Yeah, re-reading patch notes from the past 3 years, I've been seriously wondering who they think they're making the game for. So many misguided attempts to please everyone or attract new players...
---
I'm seriously losing faith we will ever see major changes to FW or sov. CCP doesn't seem to work on content anymore, unless it's accessible to all and affects all areas of the game.
---
For attention.
---
Looks like it, good times indeed. https://zkillboard.com/kill/6165073/
---
&gt;What are the rules? Can they play in their spare time? On a non-CCP alt? Can they join or run a sov-holding alliance while at CCP?
---
They can join alliances but aren't allowed to disclose that they are CCP staff, and aren't allowed for any usage of GM tools/transfers from GM accounts to their player accounts.
---
I am upvoting you good sir, strictly on the basis of your flair.
---
They‚Äôre encouraged to play and they generally don‚Äôt disclose who they are. 
---
I downloaded it years back, before I had a gaming PC and my computer just couldn't handle it. One day I was just looking for something else to play, saw it in my steam library and gave it another go... boy were we missing out!
---
&gt; Hell folks in Congress go home every weekend because they‚Äôre being good representatives, not bad ones. You can‚Äôt be a good representative without face time, and that‚Äôs true in EVE as much as it is in any other walk of life.
---
How do you communicate with who you "represent?" You fly out to EVE players houses or do you use discord? CSM is and always will be a joke.
---
freighters
---
eh, agree to disagree?  the viewership numbers are horrible on twitch.  There is little press.  Honestly if i didn't get the ping in game, i wouldn't even know it was going on.  Even here on reddit there are only a handful of threads when it goes on.  
---
Fuck No!
---
It uses capital parts in construction, and is categorized as capital in some parts of the game (old POS coding problems).
---
You cant use jump drive as a point, due to BLOPS.
---
Your only valid point is capital skill usage, which is a valid point.
---
But it doesn't change that, due to the way it's built, and coded, it's a capital, that isn't. Like a freighter.
---
I believe that if you have EVE characters when you start a career at CCP they will get frozen, and you can get them back once you eventually quit.
---
Such a nice story. 
---
Is anyone else tired of the bitching and moaning as I am?
---
Sorry about that.
---
tl:dr of OPs post: I wanna mining bot so am gonna make a post for Orca buffs in HS and see how many retards bite.
---
No thanks. 
---
So many things in this game have been and still are being fucking completely ruined because of retarded mining and in the name of "cuz minerz..." that its a horrible idea all the way up to the latest and still ongoing current Gala event.
---
In fact, HS Orcas need a big ass nerf so they can't make ungankable fits anymore and mining needs a replacement with something that requires some actual gameplay not AFKing and botting.
---
You like this New Eden?
---
&gt;old POS coding problems
---
Old POS code is about as relevant as old caps that weren't moved to LS/NS. The rait can't dock or build caps but it can build an orca, the parts used to build it don't make it a capital.
---
if you ban stainguy i'll find you
---
I've been playing for over 10 years, you just need to break out of any funk you find yourself in and try something new. Eventually you will find something that pushes all your buttons and the 'love' comes back again, least till CCP shits on it and you move onto the next thing to learn/that you loved. Also if you feel burnt out, just stop playing for a week or two, no point forcing it. If your not having fun, step away and come back later.
---
So be it. Burn an alt to shitpost. 
---
What is this other MMO they are working on?
---
I've quitted big sov alliances and now all this barely affects me. 
---
Seriously... You guys complain so much about injectors and capitals, and rorquals...
---
Stop joining those alliances. Simple as that. Stop feeding the system you hate. 
---
Year ago, perhaps mid 2009, I put my corp into O.W.N Alliance. First or second day in the alliance I fielded the only dread (a Moros) during a pos bash. It was nerve racking and exhilarating fielding such an expensive ship both ISK and skillwise.
---
nah

orca can go to highsec
---
rorq can't

your argument is invalid.

Close enough hahaha

---
it is outdated and about WOD, however some of the stuff described and touched upon in it is not that old such as cancellation of Walking In Stations etc. 
---
I have a strong feeling CCPs business and "professional" practices and conduct remain largely the same as described within it. So cancelling CCPs non-Eve projects affects Eve greatly for various reasons. Most of all because the no longer have staff to poach / reassign to for the bigger content or updates for Eve.
---
Makes some real sense to me.
---
Isn't warframe like ridiculously p2w?
---
And they refuse to add qol updates like an auction house because then it would be less p2w?
---
At least GGG has the excuse of just having a stubborn and idiotic outlook on their trade system.
---
So an Orca can mine as quick as a Mack, can fit 7x as much ore in, can go over 300k tank with 4-500 dps but it needs a buff, lol yeah sure.
---
The problem is mining is where the money is. Literally. A miner running 10+ accounts is worth more in real world money than that pve player who stays alpha. The game is destined to be controlled by mining until some other activity is as easily scalable and afk-able. At which time, the game design will then focus on that activity.

I hate injectors because they basically killed off the value of my specced characters :( having paid subs for years and built up pure spec characters, was something satisfying showing off all lvl 5s, did take away a lot knowing someone could just blow money and skill everything (even more so when people who got rich off the casinos did it) :\\

It they have an existing account it gets frozen. CCP then creates new characters with the same skills/assets etc., so they get some continuity but they have to play under new names. When they leave the company CCP will unfreeze their old personal accounts and transfer over the progress they've made.
---
They can, and some do, play in nullsec alliances, but they have to be careful about players recognizing them, which limits what they can do (e.g. they're not going to be talking on comms much, probably). Internal affairs keeps a close eye on them.
---
True
---
Injectors were one of the last things revealed to CSM X, and I think one of the first things CSM XI had to talk through. I remember being most concerned that injectors would make EVE grindier, in the sense that before there was no way to gain SP faster, meaning "passive SP" was the fastest which made the game laid back. Post injectors you can always get more SP.
---
It's pretty well understood that the line between cap and subcap is blurred in the case of the Orca, as well as in the case of freighters including the Bowhead. They are XL class ships that require capital components to build, and leave capital-style wrecks when destroyed; but can also take highsec gates and have the ability to dock in any Upwell structure. The Orca is especially quirky with its combination of capital-esque ship maintenance bay, large rigs, and battleship-class mass. Anybody could find all that to be contradictory and confusing.
---
If I could link the type of posts that we're specifically nuking this would be a hell of a lot easier. But since mods are getting banned left and right for simply mentioning someone on reddit by username pretty much regardless of context... I can't really take the chance right now.
---
Did you forget what happened when the mods went on strike?
---
If you paint low quality spaceship art in a Mongolian art style I'll make an exception.
---
No, you didn't grow some teeth, you are hiding behind numbers, that's all.
---
But you now got what you wanted. All those evil evil PVPers are slowly leaving the game and you and your ilk can sit ingame and mine in 100% safety. Years and years of staring at the screen pressing F1 and relocking.
---
falls that's not the excavators the problem... its one multiboxing 10 of them times empire size..
---
I use a rorqual without cap umbrella its already risky enough to activate industrial mode and being stuck for 5 min..
---
When I left EVE I simply left all my assets in a wormhole. I believe the citadel is now unanchored and my assets lost. I don't even care anymore. It might shock you, but it's really just pixels, nothing more.

Too late.

&gt;	CCP is in no rush to release Project Nova until we‚Äôre satisfied it provides a rock-solid gameplay experience and visuals to match.

If any injectors are going spare, feel free to send some to Dominoscraft beerismygod üôè

*Hey just noticed..* It's your **6th Cakeday** qubedView! ^(hug)
---
Injectors are why I quit Eve. It felt like they were whaling the game before it died.
---
Yes, not &gt;Project Nova will be released
---
CCP saying nova will be released when they're "satisfied" is about as reliable a guarantee of release as SC saying their game will be out in 2020.
---
Donate me all ya stuff, contract to Dominoscraft beerismygod anywhere in New Eden

Note that these are not stations, they are Upwell structures, which can be anchored with or without sov.

If somebody attacks your iHub but leaves your TCU it means they want to harm you but aren't interested in actually conquering your territory. The TCU is a merely flag that declares ownership while the iHub contains all the expensive system upgrades that make your space worth living in.

I'm guessing English isn't your first language based on your grammar, which is totally fine but on the off chance somethings are lost in translation I'll address your concerns here:  The "modbias" thing is a joke that gets regularly thrown around. It started when I was accused of being both anti-goon bias and pro-goon bias at the same time.
---
&gt; It's crazy the fact this mod in this very thread dig through someone's posting history to public shame him.
---
You have to check someone's post history to do mod work, especially on bigger subreddits. Even if you are lucky enough to have the skills on your team to build much better tools, the only way you have to reliably find out if someone breaking a rule is a trend or a one time / first time thing is via the post history. Any good mod should check a users history before issuing any form of account action, every single time. It's absolutely mandatory to even function as a mod. Without some context on the user you are effectively useless when making a decision about them.
---
&gt; Posts here were always on low-effort spectrum wondering why this one mod starting to care all of a sudden.
---
I said so in my OP but I'll explain it here to. Eve has a lot of very controversial things happening at the moment. With the AT being cancelled this year we have a situation that impacts a very core part of Eve. There have been multiple very high effort posts made by people about the topic that were drown out almost completely by the sea of low effort stuff.
---
This is also the lowest quality state we've ever seen the subreddit in, by far. R/eve is and always will be open to shitposts. We're not targeting shit posts in any way. But we literally have threads, en masse, that are along the lines of "wiht AT gone maybe lowsec will b good" as a title, and the actual post simply says "title". That's not a shitpost - that's a *shit* post.
---
A call for improvement does not mean we need them to have skill injectors. Its not the only option. 
---
I think CCP should go the other way and remove the mining drone bonus entirely
---
I have no idea it's literally a spaceship MMO forum and we don't have any real power.
---
I dont think thats true either, Ive played this game off and on since 2005 and never felt the need to "catch up". I dont have anywhere close to max skills - and I dont feel the need to. Being "behind" in this game is nonsensical - you want the shit train for it. Dont cry over it taking some time.
---
Can look at brave, goons, test, ph. I'm sure other northern groups have their own thing. I'm biased towards test newbro corps followed by brave then goons. Those would be good starting places to look for their newbro groups. You can look at my corp moosearmy and join our ingame public channel. Were new bro friendly ish just need to have some skills already trained like. And if  you dont meet our stuff we can point you in the direction of other corps youd fit within test
---
Thought you might be threatening banning or some shit
---
Sticky's can effectively hide a thread if you use them too much or in certain ways. They are kind of like searching for something on Google - people tend to just passively ignore the top few search results because they are paid advertisements.
---
See my other reply, simply doesnt matter. If you feel the need to fly all the best ships in the game at the start then I guess this isnt the game for you. Too fucking bad. Work for it.

Shark week sucks , you know it ,  I know it and those garbage thread makers know it . How many times ya gotta watch the same documentary  every year??  :)

I dont rewatch Johnny Pew videos ........................ ok fine I do

un-Ironically your post was part of the reason.

It has large rigs, and not capital rigs, therefore not a capital ship.

This is terrible and you should feel bad, but have an up vote.

So your point is...

Players: Make Ibis worth flying. 
---
Malcanis: ibis has 30k local tank, 1k dps, and makes 100m isk per hour afk, and can go invul on demand for 10 mins with cyno lit.  Be careful what you wish for plebs, 
---
And it‚Äôs the players fault?  Fuck off.
---
Imagine putting 5-10 times what your ship is worth in your drone bay.

I am talking about if skill urself were to kick their current renters for rules violations.

Considering I rage posted that it kind of is.
---
We brought up doing something like this awhile ago because the 'mod strike' ended up being kind of amazing. So I kind of already knew some of the problems and how to pre-empt them.
---
This way is better I think than just escalating out of the blue to most people. Plus if it fails we just end it and resume regularly garbage posting and I probably fuck off to do things with my life I haven't had the freetime to in ages... like actually play Eve.

I got tempted back into Eve Online at Christmas after last playing in 2011 (Guess all the spam into my inbox for 7 years finally paid off) so I've missed a lot of stuff. Not enough stuff to know that you are talking complete and utter rubbish. 
---
If you can not tell the difference between a character with 30 million sp that has taken well over a year to train up, to one that can acquire that sp in a matter of hours, I think you have a problem. 
---
Yes, both to a brand new player are equipped with the tools to do better in Eve Online but don't bother with the sob story about older characters always being better. Starting in 2006 rather than 2003 made absolutely zero difference when it came to flying the type of ships I wanted to, once I had trained the skills. Ok fine, I wasn't flying around in a Thanatos, boo bloody hoo. But I was flying in a Taranis with good skills and a decent fit where it was my actual skill and knowledge of the game that counted, not having every racial battleship skill trained to level 5.
---
Having supercapitals and titans locked behind their excessive sp requirement balanced the game. Sure it was getting a bit blobby when I left Eve as more pilots came online and alliances built up their reserves but you were still limited by the number of pilots who could actually fly the ships. 
---
I think it would depend on where you are at and what kind of content you were looking for. With goons, im assuming you mean karma fleet when you say that, you would get a "safe space" but keep in mind that people love to hunt goons, however as you stated you were interested in industry and pi, goons are the kings of nullsec industry, so im sure you could get in on some of that, maybe find someone to show you better ways to do it and give pointers. Also you would likely get a chance to participate in larger fleets, as a tackle or maybe scout role. With eve uni, im not 100% but im pretty sure they do have some space to rat and mine, but they would not have the defensive infrastructure and intel to the extent that goons would. However they do have people that can teach you pretty much anything and are willing to do so. For pvp, i imagine they would have alot of small gang and small fleet pvp, however maybe they show up and third party in bigger fights or join up woth friends, idk. Pandemic Horde would be very similar effectively to goons, woth space to rat and mine, industry people and large scale pvp, again, people love to beat on horde because they give gud fights (usually) so keep that in mind. Another group to look at is Brave Newbies, again, alot like horde and goons, again, people love to go shoot them, cause they will fight and also because the space they live is in catch, which is pretty much where you have to go through if you wanna go anywhere in southern nullsec. Shamless plug at the end, The Rogue Consortium is a group that works in and around providence and has a group dedicated to teaching new players and has a good indy group, however to call their space "safe" would be pushing it. Thats my two cents, i was in your position a few years ago in a "newbro" corp that pretty much sat in station and only went out when no one was around. Best of luck in your search, hope you find a space home that you find fun and teaches you how to enjoy the game. o7

&gt;In a PVP orientated game, we grabbed the bull by the horns and tried to hang on. Sometimes she shook us to the ground, and sometimes for a brief but perfect moment, we held on long enough to dance around in the beautiful expansive galaxy and felt truly we were the masters of it all. But these were just moments, we were just dust in space, being carried ever onwards towards an outcome we had little influence over.

This is a perfect metaphor. Well written. I will remember this description for a long time. Thank you.

Regular sites (not Data/Relics) is totally doable in passive RS. I just didn't like flying 600-700mil ship, and also sleepers tended to web/aggro my Gecko, which affected the time required to do every site.

Sin that died because a lot of bad luck over about two weeks (and by "bad luck" I mean the game answering all the "so what else could go wrong here?" questions) ended up with me in a bubble without MJD seeing about 20 T3s being covert bridged at their optimal and two-shotting me. It wasn't disappointing because of loss (it happens), but because if not for about 10 unrelated things going horribly wrong (including the worst timed incursion spawn I've ever seen) it would otherwise be a Hel kill - and my first super kill ever.

I appreciate the informative reply,  and thanks for taking the time to write it down. Also a question, you mentioned Karma Fleet, I noticed under the same alliance there‚Äôs some other noob friendly corps such as Ascendence and Paxton Federation but not sure if they‚Äôre as viable? It‚Äôs really difficult to make a decision, because I don‚Äôt wanna seem like a Corp hopper and go from Corp to Corp not sure if it will look good on my employment history..

The rules GSF created for it kill the region. The way goons structured it, literally the only kind of objective-based fight you can have is a war over sov. Those are too expensive. So, no one has reason to fight. Thanks, GSF.
---
I have carriers with large rigs, are they not capitals until I replace them?
---
(I'm just playing devil's advocate. Orcas aren't capitals, but they aren't sub caps either. Calling someone genuinely retarded because Orcas aren't clear-cut when compared to other industrial capitals or subcaps just isn't kosher).

Thanks, it's 4am and I'm now rewatching all Clarion Call videos to see if that last statement holds true or not.

---
&gt; There are moments of try-harding and there are stakes for us too. I guess I just make an active decision to not devote my life to the game.
---
You have that luxury because nobody cares if you don't turn up for fleets. In a small alliance, you have to turn up to as many fleets as you can because your alliance needs every ship it can get. You don't have to be tryhard because you'll always have more bodies to throw at the problem. That doesn't mean that it can't be fun, it just takes more work to be successful because small groups will always have a disadvantage, even without CCP constantly shitting all over them.
---
&gt;For all the hate "null blobs" get I have not experienced a more light hearted and fun environment than Imperium of which I've been a part of since 2014.
---
There are tons of alliances with a fun and friendly environment. The "strict tryhard leet-pvper alliance" stereotype is pretty much completely false imo. I'm sure there's a group like that somewhere, but I've yet to find it.

Also, I'd like to add something about this:

&gt;A couple years ago, capitals were rarely used because if you undocked them you were immediately hot dropped by PL or other roaming super blobs.
---
Sure. I agree that PL or whoever dropping on capitals from across the map sucked. And yet now, you get people dropping supers on roaming subcaps. Instead of capitals suffering, it's roaming as a playstyle suffering because they just get caps dropped on them, sometimes even lone frigates will have supers dropped on them.
---
Is that really better than what we had?
---
regex finds -- aword
---
So no more r/eve?
---
Bring back clone states. If you forget to update your clone and then get podded, you should be punished. Hard.
---
Using an x-instinct booster also reduce signature radius.
---
*ray tracing intensifies*
---
Goons are balancing Rorqs AT is cancelled CCP sucks. Upbots to the left
---
I'm here incognito. 
---
Actions are better than words.
---
Why login to a game and grumble?
---
I stopped playing even though I liked Eve Online.
---
Maybe I will play again when CCP fix their shit they made.
---
So Karma Fleet is the largest of the new player groups within goonswarm and generally the most well known. I dont know a whole about the other new player groups in goons, perhaps they are other language groups or a different time zone. Could be something to look into depending on where you are playing out of. As for changing corp alot, i dont know of any groups that frown upon it, sure if you leave alot of corps on bad terms, people might see that negatively, but as long as you are not getting kicked or starting shit, i dont see why anyone would form a negative opinion about it.

Buy an extractor, sell an injector, buy as many extractors as possible, sell all injectors, repeat until no SP left and give away the remaining injectors
---
Lol. Yeah, your piles of fake, mmo money makes you big time. 
---
Being able to partake in activists that everybody does is a little different than just wanting to fly the best of everything from the get go. Training up _basics_ takes months. I‚Äôm not a new player, I understand how the game works too.
---
No need for the attitude dude.
---
two friends and i are couch surfing another friends wormhole, its really nice to being playing games with friends again even if theyre filthy casuals who have more sp than me but know significantly less than i do :)
---
This is a bad post.
---
Any kind of actual multithreading would be very difficult to implement - most of EVE's logic is (by CCP slideshows from around 2004-2009 and mentions in devblogs over last several years) written in Python, which includes bunch of client-side code. Python has something called "Global Interpreter Lock" that - for certain things - causes all threads running same Python interpreter (so, sharing any data directly) to pause the execution so one thread can do its stuff without everything exploding in very unpredictible manner.
---
And if you'd for any reason consider that a mistake on CCP side - remember they picked their core tech stack around the time, when hardware multithreading meant servers and workstations having multiple single-threaded CPUs installed. This is something that can't be fixed without rewriting almost all game logic, and rewrite of this scale would mean tons of new bugs (remember chat system?) and all resources stuck in providing absolutely no meaningful changes for very long time.
---
As for crashes - X47 battle had crashes to desktop, especially on clients you tried to log back in after getting socket close/first crash. 64-bit will help keeping client stable during these fights (it doesn't solve any server-side issues with soulcrushing lag), but outside that I doubt it'll change much.
---
it had its drawbacks. if pl found out about your fight they could cyno chain across new eden in 20 minutes and shit on your fun
---
I drink *some* beer, just not IPAs ok. And who are you to complain, how many beers did I give you?
---
:pray:
---
This.
---
Well you're making some assumptions, TNT generally runs fleets independently of Imperium and we create out own objectives when we aren't at war. We definitely don't have infinite numbers whenever we want them, 30-60 form ups is typical and we are constantly trying to do things outnumbered.
---
Anyway this conversation is getting pretty played out, for your last question I'll just say that in my opinion, yes it is, and we can agree to disagree.
---
You dont need to train for months to take part in things everyone does, thats simply false, youre just making stuff up at this point so I dont really care what attitude you think I have. 
---
Was worth a try ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

You sound like it's some kind of achievement.

Hello Friend.
---
Please take a look at r/evejobs. It's a subreddit dedicated entirely to recruitment.
---
Normally we remove recruitment posts here and send them to r/evejobs but sometimes let them through if there haven't been a lot of them lately.
---
Thank you.
---
haha the event is so shit this guy hasn't even done it yet xD
---
https://www.reddit.com/user/Jibrish/
---
Its tank? Considerably I think. 
---
for a few days then we will probably get bored and quit
---
Thanks for the reddit link and thank you for not removing my post. I thought I‚Äôd post here because I was looking for a more general discussion so I could make up my mind. I was thinking if I reposted on r/evejobs people would mostly focus on recruiting me to their own corporations rather than discussing different ones. Once again, thank you for giving me a chance :)

After a year of grinding L4 missions which make Classic WoW quests seem inventive, mining Veldspar, and playing the various arcs that play just like L2-L4 missions, , I can't agree &gt;&lt;

I might be a noob but... *GSF FLAIR*
---
@_@
---
Me too.  But at the same time, injectors are here.  Taking them away now will just alienate a fucktonne of new people and prevent many from even bothering to invest the time and effort to start a character.
---
What the game needs now is a new balance pass.  Capitals shouldn't be able to do crap to anything smaller than a battleship.  Frigates shouldn't be able to solo-tackle a capital. Tons of crap like that in the game and people complain about stuff that will not change because it's too late for it.
---
Gone are the days of actual skill, going on a roam and having actual good fights, now it's form up a cruiser fleet, get two jumps into someone's territory and get shut down by gate camping titans, or supers that can kill anything they see.
---
Yeah but you could put it on any ship with 50m3 bwith bro
---
Or how bout making injectors carry a name. So at least you can remap your skills.
---
I.e. skills can still be extracted and re injected into the same player.
---
lol awesome

I hope to achieve a shark attacked post this week. Do I get a badge? That would be cool.

The more they supercharge stuff, the more we are going to bring to break it again üòÇ
---
And yeah I wasn‚Äôt in X47, was saving DC‚Äôs in a mid point. 
---
You're gay
---
Did your opinion on injectors change over time? 
---
How are you staying ahead of anything if you are playing SkillQueue-Online? Sure you'll have plenty of SP to fly everything, but if you don't play actively, you are gonna be rusty or garbage when you do play. "Catching up" was something people complained about for years, but people still join the game and become little firecracker FCs and PVPers within their first year. SP is not the thing that holds people back, for the most part. 
---
What if my flair was moderator assigned?
---
As i recall you're the turbofaggot who assigned it
---
They don't have to be "killing Eve" to be doing a piss poor job of managing it. Few MMOs that were successful have totally died out, even ones older than Eve. AT was just one thing among many that set poorly with a lot of players and suggest CCP is not dedicated to improving Eve. Etc.
---
Something tells me you don't have any experience organizing large events.
---
&gt; pay more = attract more people
---
You mean the thing where I said they should hire more people and mentioned job postings stay up for unusually long periods of time?
---
I quit playing the game when they added it. I felt backstabbed because i have finally built a 100 mil sp character after a few years and then it was all pointless over night and had no value since anyone could do it in 1 day. Most of my corp felt the same way about it and they just gave up.
---
Same here my friend... Same here
---
&gt; you are gonna be rusty or garbage when you do play.
---
Eve isn't that hard or fast lmao
---
The problem is that as the game matures and the playerbase matures t1 doctrines just aren't cutting it. Apoc/mega baltec fleets are pretty much the only null-blob viable fleet right now that is t1.
---
Well I guess the whole grind thing never really seemed to happen. If anything it was the opposite, skill injectors allowed people to completely bypass grind and trivially spin off capital pilots.
---
My biggest issue for them now is definitely the acceleration of meta warping via mass extraction/injection. 
---
because ccp pays like shit
---
OP is a mod? No wonder this sub is trash.
---
It's totally normal for your 20s to be spent on booze and obsessions. No regrets! Be nostalgic about all the fun you had, minding that it is non-repeatable. Your 30s are when you become conscious of your mortality and start to establish a sustainable lifestyle. I kicked smoking at 29, booze at 32, and EVE a couple months ago (although I am still in the habit of hanging out here). I'm closer to my loved ones and I switched to a career with a long-term future that I sincerely enjoy.
---
Okay yeah they're aids for long time players. But the reason they existed, atleast initially, is to bring in a new player base. Personally I hate recommending eve to people. Because if they've never played, the first like 3 months of the game is boring as hell. They are worried about making 2 million isk and can't fly anything fitted properly. So although injectors are aids, it was meant to help new people out and not have a total shit experience when starting.

Contact CCP support. My friend did this and got it transferred to the right account after a few days.
---
There's no going back. Eve may be around for 'forever' but it's all about profit maximising now. Eve isn't dying, Eve as we knew it is dead. 
---
You're a fool. Not necessarily because what you're saying is untrue (it probably is, at least for the near future), but because you have nothing to contribute to a discussion but cynicism. The least you could do, if that's what you really think, is state a potential scenario or two where you think injectors *could* be removed (say, the game's playerbase is decimated and CCP decides a drastic change of course is required).
---
People like you are the reason r/eve (and internet communities in general) suck. You contribute without contributing anything. Just quit Eve and go play some other game if you think there's no hope for the game. There's no reason for empty bitching.
---
Thank you, I just did.
---
Hopefully it gets resolved somewhat quickly, my GF just broke up with me so I've got a ton more free time on my hands now and I'm excited to actually get into EVE.
---
You've chosen the hard and vegan Lifestyle. Don't blame others for your need for elitism.
---
Training basics to lvl 3 can have you be nominally prepared to get into most activities. When I started as long as you can scram and use prop mods, you could PvP. Injectors kind of made people soft IMO
---
You started just in time then, I think mine will break up with me because of Eve...
---
Lots of empty site in lowsec where I live, Verge Vendor, Placid, Essence etc
---
You had me til the last sentence. I don't know how much effort goes into that observation because I don't know how much observation occurs at all
---
3 real 5 me
---
Wait what... no IPA?!
---
Yes, I remember all of that (I started mid 2007), but all of those ccp was more concerned with making the game better. Can you honestly say when the last real expansion with good content came out? Oh sure they added citadels, but that was because pos were cancerous. But other then that? Oh I‚Äôm sure folks will say ‚Äúyeah, but they got away from doing a big expansion and do smaller updates more often.‚Äù How is that system working out?
---
I liked your backhand comment of being new to eve, but no. I‚Äôve seen the best days of eve and I know they are very much in the past. Now it‚Äôs just a rotting husk of what it used to be
---
well shouldn't this post get removed then?
---
go big or go home! 
---
I'm totally down for this as a 30mil sp character with a second account on the come up. I don't spam injectors but I like to use them when I can afford them. With the bots and rorqual/titan/super account proliferation the price has skyrocketed. I haven't bought one since they broke 800mil. I would love for them to go back down in price so I could afford one every once in awhile. 
---
That sounds terrifying. 
---
Um adding to cons, bots still skill inject into vnis with no issues
---
literally who is this guy all i know is he's the guy that lost his mind that someone took his screenshot from a facebook page
---
And *why* is there only a limited number of T1 doctrines that are null-blob viable now? Possibly because‚Ä¶ your enemies can instantly amass a blob of T2 and pirates with no training time needed?
---
What a shock! T1 is unviable when it can be instantly outclassed with a skill injector! Who could have foreseen that letting people inject SP means a decrease in the use of T1 in favor of previously heavily skill-locked ships!
---
But seriously, the *only* reason why T1 is no longer viable is because there's no longer a time sink to fielding bigger ships. When everyone has to wait months for a pilot toon to pop Bigger Gun V, it limits how much can be fielded, and therefore how much it effects the meta.
---
There are vastly more low-training-time characters than high-training-time characters. By the time your alliance gets some toons up to speed on at least Bigger Gun IV, your enemies have done the same, and you both got a lot more fresh toons. The proportion of low-time characters to high-time characters stays roughly the same, assuming the rate of character creation hasn't changed.
---
When you don't need veteran characters to throw Machs at the problem, you don't need T1 ships.
---
&gt; I noticed under the same alliance there‚Äôs some other noob friendly corps such as Ascendence and Paxton Federation but not sure if they‚Äôre as viable? 
---
They're all fine -- your corp identity doesn't matter much in GSF, but join whichever one catches your eye, if it's not working out, try another, whatever.  We're pretty alliance-focused vs corp-focused in general, so people are generally gonna point you to Karma first as they just have a very good rep for newbie support beyond what the alliance offers.
---
&gt;It‚Äôs really difficult to make a decision, because I don‚Äôt wanna seem like a Corp hopper and go from Corp to Corp not sure if it will look good on my employment history..
---
No one cares, honestly.  Shop around if you want.
---
Holy hell you sound brilliant. What do you do for a living if you dont mind me asking publicly like this. Its cool if you dont want to say.
---
worst part is that in this vid he says solo/small gang pvp is "end game" and when asked what he wants to say to ccp he mentions nothing about wanting frequent balance passes and instead is just like "why did u fire ur pr team" "why are you catering to the asian market" (??????)
---
In other news, Brave takes smack talk to a new, more cringey level. 
---
+1 for the ironic "stay classy" at the end, though
---
Path of Exile. Its a free game, no frills, no high end cinematics or anything, focused on gameplay. Free is perfectly playable up to around act 10, pass that you'll need some tabs. I put in a total of $30 into it and I got space to last me for a long long time.

About a month ago I was suddenly faced with the very real possibility of not having a place to live. It was a serious problem and I had no idea how to get myself out of that mess - since then, I've managed to find my way.
---
However, for a while there I was in a bit of a panic. Realizing that there was a very real possibility that I'd soon not have a bed to lie down on, let alone be able to play Eve, I warned my corp. I did not ask for help, nor expect any.
---
Absolutely *everyone* I'd contacted tried to help. People all across the country were saying I could crash on their couch if I had to, but that I *would have* a place to live if it came to that.
---
Suddenly, I could breathe again. In the end, I didn't need their help - but in that moment, I desperately needed that and was given it without the slightest hesitation.
---
I have never seen anything like this before in any game I've played.
---
**This** is the game and community that CCP created.
---
Thank you CCP.

---
thanks taka, u da bes
---
Most of them just hold their breath.
---
I mean I was good at making isk when I was a noob and I was sitting in t1 logi wishing I could fly t2 even though I could afford it.
---
All of my characters are bought or injected except for the one I started eve with.
---
Without injectors, I'd probably have already quit.
---
A character on the bazaar had to be trained, and had to exist.  Skill injectors let skillfarmers paralellize the creation of skillpoints, which is why it is possible to 'skim the cream' from the sp farm toons and inject it all into a specialized character in record time.  
---
A fool and his isk are soon parted
---
Take my upvote, take it take it take it
---
&gt;I think this game needs an genocide event... to thin out the population, assets and wealth.

---
OOoo, that actually sounds so good. 
---
When I was a new bro i bought my first orca. I joined a null sec Corp and was jumping it down one system from highsec . A friendly jumped through first and said it was clear. I jumped and got whelped by 30 HACs .
---
I totally got noobed here by CCP, expecting any sensible reward from their PVE events, lol. The sad story though being that these events have become utterly trash for people that liked them. It has become a complete waste of precious dev time that could have been put to so much better use.
---
This is why I refuse to use injectors.  Been playing since 08.  
---
The Mittani (pbuh) and his henchmen have destroyed EVE with their superior organization skills. Spodbless
---
The problem is that the corps/alliances with all the high sp end up dominating anyone that tries to get in.
---
See: brave vs pl.  as the most recent example.
---
fuck off retard
---
It's become pretty evident that CCP has lost touch with its indy roots and no longer sees EVE as a sustainable product. The changes they have made to EVE in the last few years have been to entice people to not quit and to make EVE more approachable to casual players. This has entailed nerfing risk, violating the once sacred tenet that skillpoints cannot be bought or traded, making it free-to-play, running steeply discounted sales so often that few are willing to pay regular price, and allowing easy ISK farming so everybody can feel successful. They have sacked their community team and started canceling events that do not directly drive profit. They maintain only a skeleton crew of developers, most of whom work on graphic design rather than core mechanics. And every bit of profit CCP squeezes out of EVE is poured into other projects that are aimed at an entirely different audience than that which was originally attracted to EVE.
---
So we've essentially got a game in maintenance mode for which the developer has lost its passion, and the core player base is losing its faith that things can be turned around.
---
I know, right?  I love the overview but how can I take it seriously if the dude can't get down with some IPA?
---
blame the fanboys who still defend ccp to this day

Are you aware of the switch in business model that took place ? If not its burried in here [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/05/world-of-darkness-the-inside-story-mmo-ccp-white-wolf](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/05/world-of-darkness-the-inside-story-mmo-ccp-white-wolf)
---
I have seen a ton of design changes and decisions being made to fit the current business model rather then live of off what regular players pay. Cap proliferation, Rorqs, multiboxing, even botting (contrary to what they publicly say), it all falls right into place.
---
You and /u/jehe are the retards. The only thing you zombie responses accomplish is discouraging people from making the effort to share actual ideas.

I suggest you follow your own advice and quit Eve and this subreddit.
---
Fool.
---
The only way skill injectors changed the balance of power was: SP wins -&gt; ISK wins.
---
It favored long-runners. It still favors long runners.
---
that was a wealth and org difference. Comps where a part of it but at that point eve wasn't supers online, PL had a lot of supers but was not todays lvl of \*insert ANY ns group\*. 
---
Heck even renter corps have supers, if you don't know what's the deal with that before if you had 1 let's say aeon pilot in your corp, it was BIG  but like really big deal. and could get your corp inside an alliance. That was still a thing during brave eviction form PB. rorqs+inject happened not long after, so yeah...
---
Don't even get me started of what was to have a bridge titan, you would get in most big boys groups.   
---
Like you would have acorp join you cause they had 5 carrier pilots back when carriers had another use beside lagging the grid.
---
Injectors are not tools for the new player. They're tools for the rich player. Malcanis's law applies in spades to injectors. 
---
I look forward to never seeing you again.
---
I mean this in the sadest way possible. Only because this game doesnt deserve people.who care about it anymore.
---
Hopefully someone creates a new game for us.  But my hopes are not high, its more about money then art or the game nowdays.
---
And its very very sad.
---
F
---
I mean now casual newbs can scale isk making to what a pvp-centric bitter vet will do a lot quicker.
---
There is an upper limit to how much people are willing/able to scale their isk making.
---
CCP
---
If I was to join I think I‚Äôd be better off in one of the other corps in the alliance, it seems a little difficult karmafleet since you have to hang around and there‚Äôs a chance of never being noticed haha. 
---
The part about the employment history, isn‚Äôt it a possibility that people could think you‚Äôre a spy or something though?
---
I'm still waiting for my police Flycatcher and Devoter skins though.
---
i mean, a good deal of them are fcs, roamers, whatever. sure, it's not a massive 30% chunk or anything but is it really a good idea to just start cutting out groups for no real reason?
---
doesn't just seem like a great idea to me
---
Thats great OP,  you should start with this one. Seems a bit of a angry rant, doesn't have a clear vision.

I remember when there was BOB Cheating scandals, Dev's in player alliances giving away T2 BPO's that were licenses to print isk, sharing internal knowledge of how backend systems work, and the "Batphone" personal hotline to the devs if things didn't go their way.
---
It would indeed. And on a personal note, I'd be happily the guy flying the catalyst in this case, but alas, I really wanted to see what peoples thoughts are on the future of events, other then: cancel it, remove it, yadda yadda.
---
That makes sense.
---
eve is dying transformed into 'eve is dead;
---
Fooool.
---
Fool
---
ur funny
---
Not when the vets can grind ISK, and therefore SP, and therefore outfit toons, faster than casual noobs.
---
Yeah sure, you can inject to Get Gud IV now. But *that guy* over there with the old money injected 10 characters to Get Gud V *and* Advanced Get Gud V.
---
So you are saying orca needs PANIC?
---
Yeah, I've heard KF's recruitment has had some hiccups lately.  Not sure what the reality is, but not the first time I've heard that.
---
Regardless, if you're leaving corps on decent terms, no one is gonna bat an eye.   A newbie who did some corp hopping isn't a red flag.
---

&gt; Please tell me, if CCP wanted short earns and didn't care about their game, would they make the announcement they did or would they leave the game in 32bit in 2020 ? Wouldn't they let players have better loot in their GALA event ? 
---
Theres a shitstorm on the main forums about Gala, they can't ignore it, they are actually losing money cause of it, continuously, so they eitehr do something or who knows when its gonna bottom out.
---
64 bit client is necessary for their business model. Need more RAM / VRAM access. You apparently do not know what their business model is and are incapable of looking at their actions / inactions over the past few years and putting the 2 and 2 together. 
---
O and look for your own links and sources, am not here to hold your hand for you. Especially that its been posted in so many places already.

Well I was/am the CEO of CENTI, we weren't formed for the AT but as a small/med-scale pvp group which ended up pretty much taking tenerifis. I'd say the AT was pretty much the only chance of me coming back and trying again.

Thanks
---
Aww
---
&gt;  killing the AT due to funding whilst creating a new mmo with eve money just further upset people
---
lmfao 
---
I get your point and I'm also sad that the small/med scale pvp that went beyond an occasional roam has been destroyed.  My best Eve experiences are about putting a pos in hostile space and fighting against huge odds.
---
But this AT scandal has nothing to do with the above, and if we lose a player who doesn't play anymore for anything else than AT, it's not much of a loss to the community.  Sorry.
---
Got emmm!
---
Revenge of the Revelation named Bethany! RIP.
---
It was pretty much the same as it is today (I know, shocker, right?).   
---
10 years ago eve was dying because of the speed nerf, which foretold the end of successful outnumbered engagements.   
---
10 years ago Eve was dying because of POS sov and how hard it was to remove someone from their space.   
---
10 years ago FW was dying (I feel like this sentiment was in the public consciousness like right after it came out; just a generally hated system).   
---
10 years ago mission runners were unsubing due to ninja salvaging, the first seriously organized freighter gankings, and can flipping (these were particularly spicy tears - justright.jpg).   
---
etc, etc, etc sadbois gonna sadboi, the only things that changed are what emo music they are listening to when they /wrist in game, and that in 2009 they doomheimed if they had the balls to, and now they just extract and RMT, or give the proceeds to a space friend.
---
Written properly?
---
This is eve we're talking about

Really ?
---
I mean ... Just look at this [https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/akfoqn/im\_a\_shark/](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/akfoqn/im_a_shark/) don't you wanna fly around in something like this ? I do.
---
Well, they either cater to the vocal minority that hates them, or to the silent majority that doesn't.
---
DHSJ started the whole shebang. Man mode BOI
---
no one believes you
---
"a lot of players" is legitimately a few folks reeeing on Reddit.  The vast majority of the playerbase could care less about some guys getting some shiny ships.
---
That's the resson they removed a lot lf features like the vocal chat etc, the team working on it was gine and it was blocking CCP working on a 64bit client.
---
What a joke of a company, they've ruined everything they have touched, remember that RTS that was changed into a moba and then canned because that was a poorly thought out decision 
---
It's a great idea if your solution to a sink full of dirty dishes is to set the house on fire.
---
Legacy is in all out war vs winter co and skillu? Inb4 goons 
---
AT is arguably the end game of EVE is several forms.
---
PvP focused game (at least when i started), the biggest event in which an incredible amount of wealth was on the line with the very best of the best competing, 600+ pilots that trained coutnless hours, weeks and weeks of theorycrafting, teams spyng on each other, ato ne point you coulld even bet.
---
last year ccp made it so only higgest pedigree team would actually train withouth even knowing if the AT was happening, so the lvl was meh for the most part and ccp outsourced the runnning of the tournament so it was kinda messy.
---
And they said they will look into that. here is what we have, no AT this year, the ONLY thing ccp did for the community each year with high numbers of viewerships and they said nope, not this year.
---
I understand that you might not like small gang vs small gang or whatever, but the thing i, those pilots and teams wehre arguably the very best the game had to offert in skill and planning, they took it seriuosly, ccp didn't.
---
What would you do? TQ implementation basicly is telling you \*go fuck yourself\* since 2013, they double down in 2016, suddenly being good is taken as an insult, you said, fuck tq, i'll just do AT cause it's the only thing challenging until they fix the game.  Then... no AT. why stay when the devs spit on you?
---
Honestly plainly on skill lvl and dedication AT is end game, you could argue that leading 3k dudes into the field is, if the game supported that playstile you might be right, but as of now the game don't cater either to those who want to do those battles (lag machines as carriers/supers) or to those who want to do small stuff.  
---
This might bring some perspective for you ‚ô•
---
Please... proceed, Governor.
---
Re read my first sentence 
---
SOV, basically
---
&gt;also injects wherea thing during brave vs PL
---
There may have been a later brave vs pl war but I was specifically talking about 2014 catch-era brave
---
SP was not a grind prior, it was simply a time gate and one that cost an extra sub fee each month if you wanted to maybe try out more than 1 small piece of content every several months.
---
last year was a joke high end tears didn't even knew if they would get rewards or either confirmation of if the AT was happening, generating overall a low skill lvl (with exception of the very high pedigree). 
---
funny thing is we was all fighting each other till snuffed out showed up then we all teamed up to kill them instead.
---
lol what fucking universe do you live in where you get to unironically fly a drake over a ferox or ever use a hurricane in small gang? 
---
Are you in a c1 or something? Because there are a lot of pvp gangs out there in c2 and above
---
That was the ship to use in Eve back in 06/07. A few years ago. Canes have been used in small gang on and off as meta for years. They'll sometimes see a resurgence, then fall off to the wayside as counters are quickly formed for it.
---
instead of bitching about something on reddit, go take some region of space yourself and give it to someone.  Instead of being a problem be the solution.
---
before you could stand your ground against groups, supers against cruiser IS running away, jags online make running away even more important, but the very best where in the AT that was what it meant, high intensity all or nothing fights, not running, just the biggest theory crafting/skill matchs for any noobt to watch and fall in love. i know i started to really have fun in eve after i watched the AT and tried to emulate them and better myself. Now i'm just another eve winner since some months and this was the nail in the coffin imo.
---
C2
---
5 or 6 is more than enough to take out mining ships with cheap destroyers.
---
tornados for 1 shotting things is always a viable option but they'd have to be carrying a decent amount to make it worth it.
---
don't forget you're probably going to need to use one or two of those accounts to scoop the loot, not to mention scanning and possibly bumping.
---
I wish the Vigil looked in game as good as your art. Great job. 
---
Like this dude....[https://zkillboard.com/character/91714983/](https://zkillboard.com/character/91714983/)
---
My point is that it gives people a reason to log in and actually play again, sparking interest. It's usually the content creators and guys that actually /do/ things in eve that fly in the AT in my experience and those are the guys you want motivated to actually play
---
Me 2 and i cant complain. You do know tho that wormholes are not visible for the 4 first hours unless you 'activate' them, yes? Just saying, some people don't. 
---
Guinness or go home
---
game might be doing great, but it's not longer pvp oriented nor it tries to be anymore. even if the AT came back, the fact they have the nerve of announce something like that with plain old BS is an insult to the ones that care, or cared.
---
/s
---
Hey remember in 2016 when Sion kumitomo said this exact same thing but r/eve deemed it "salty" and manbabby crying.
---
65b killed in Arzad.
---
21b killed in Sif on the astra.
---
In Sif, 38 dhsj vs 105 (accurate?) Amarr FW and other. We lost by 1b isk... not bad when you see the odds.
---
So true, a while ago I was actually replying to a post and something went wonky, after a while of going WTF is going on it dawned on me that the post I was replying to literally disappeared, so outta sheer curiosity I googled it and here it is [https://forums.eveonline.com/t/ccp-would-you-like-me-to-upgrade-to-omega/138437](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/ccp-would-you-like-me-to-upgrade-to-omega/138437)
---
Its actually a half decent. Has some CSM in it and shit too. I do see why they canned it, some fucking complete idiot basically hijacked it with his army of alts and made a mess of an otherwise decent read to the point that they had no choice. But still, that was pretty fucked up when I spent a good amount of time thinking and writing a reply and having it disappear kinda mid click. Luckily they do not own google and its not hard to use.
---
That dude should have posted it here, it might have survived, and I should have PMed him to do just that but unfortunately I was too pissed off at the time and didn't think about it.
---
I'm not braindead.
---
The meta shifts a lot but it's rare to see battle cruisers used in any real capacity outside of camps and solo pvp atm. From my experience obviously. 
---
The others that recruit newbies should have no problems with you hopping from karma fleet to ascee and back. Most of the stuff related to memebership is handled out of eve Corp anyway 
---
it was inspired by your second commment, as you seemed to not understand the importance of the whole thing.   
---
although you might aswell just ignore me i'm nothing but an bittervet with some hope still ledt in the game although not interested in it anymore, if you like the game as of now you will probably have a blast for a while longer, let's just hope they correct their path in some point on the future, so we see live again in new eden.  
---
I recommend to join a small to medium sized corp or alliance as people usually have a lot more time and dedication to teach you stuff and you have more chilled and easy communication. Just make sure theyre not a scumbags, but i think youre able to do that. I just think instead of telling every newbie to join the large blobs we need a lot more fresh blood in the smaller entities in eve. The big ones are already big enough.
---
Your Posting traveling Back in time
---
Many many moons ago, when the drake had not been nerfed yet, it was the golden child of large fleet PvP. You'd see two large waves, one a ball, the other a wall, on each side. The wall was there to firewall the incoming missiles, while the ball was lobbing their own missiles.
---
There's a reason the phrase "FC, can I bring my drake" is a thing, because so many people had gotten use to that being the mainline ship, then it got nerfed into near complete uselessness. Many sentimental individuals still like them, but they are nowhere near where they once stood. Same goes for the other battle cruisers.
---
The best ship in Eve is the friend-ship :) 
---
Didnt imply that, i know people that lived for years in a wh and didnt now how to roll, so nothing is impossible. Dont be so salty man
---
yes i'm referring to the last one, 2016 i believe pure blind.   
---
also PL was a special case before, logistics and all, etc. it wasn't as simple as high SP it was at some pooint an excellent machine that could move the whole deal across new eden in a weekend.   
---
Sp is always a big deal, but ialways took it as \*that's eve\*. i understand the old SC spam was... difficult to say the least, but you could at least do a 20 vs 20 battle against your neighboards withouth having a molok dropped on you
---
In game name is darkislife Zhang. I would love to get the pilots to fly. My main character has only 6 mil sp and I would really live to be able to fly more ships. If you are willing to send a toon over I am willing to pay the transfer fees. If not, any donations are very welcome! As a 6mil so character you can probable predict how hard it‚Äôs to make isk. If you want to find a way to extract without spending money, you can try selling your assets for 300mil then buying an extractor, once you have the extractor u can sell the skills you inject to a buy order quickly and buy more extractors ^^ As I said a character would be awesome and any donations appreciated but I understand if you are unwilling to give to someone you don‚Äôt know or if you run out of stock.
---
That was closer to 13 years ago.
---
12-13 years ago on that one.  
---
You know nothing of GW
---
But years ago there werent so many people with maxed chars and super caps. Its catching up thats the biggest problem. I dont like injectors either but without them you either played 10 years ago or shouldnt play at all.
---
Hey I know you. 
---
It was dying for few years already. People will bitch about shit that poped up just like people in real life are shitting on a government... in a pub, not doin anything realy. This changes nothing as they wont unsub nor they will stop playing, they aint gonna do shit about current situation nor any other situation in the future. Thats why eve is still running and those few of us who actually unsub makes no difference. Thats about it mi thinks.
---
idk who the big RP'ers are on the minmatar side, but PIE is still decently active in amarr mil, just had a big fight that got kicked off trying to defend one of their citadels. 
---
Same idiots who use imperial system, probably
---
a  bit hyperbolic. Maybe I know a little, but I have eyes and can do basic addition. Half the kills in this place is done by the alliance I'm in and our blues Dragon Empire.
---
so no more 1k+ karma image macros at the top this week?
---
injectors would have been fine if it werent for free to play skill farms.
---
**266 vs 39** 
---
its far worse than just a hilmar issue, eve would have to be sold to a new studio to be properly revived honestly
---
That‚Äôs a good point thanks for the heads up appreciate it
---
I would love to have at least 1 additional character and would spend the plex for the transfer. I would not use it as an extractor char, but i would probably redistribute SOME sp in case some skills i value highly are missing It would be used in wormholes primarily. I would also not change the outfit or appearance of the character if you want that. I would even write a roleplay biography in honor of your rp history. 
---
sounds like they got fucked.
---
You could be a concept artist. Nice layout, good presentation.
---
Been playing on and off for ten years. Still enjoying it. 
---
Really nice work.
---
Thanks haven't used this overview in awhile but will switch back to it now it's all up to date.
---
ur a moron commit jibrsih
---
I don‚Äôt think plex is allowed for character transfers anymore pretty sure it‚Äôs only 20$ cash as of right now 
---
I have used plex on character bazaar for the transfer like 3 months ago.
---
Sentiment appreciated but delivery is a solid 5/10.
---
It's a tactical overlay and some music. With the main thing portrayed being that you chased a peeling fleet and ships died.
---
And I‚Äôll say it again, over time this would have happened anyway. In the ten years I have been playing I have subbed for the majority, and over this ten year period I have accumulated much wealth (nothing huge) and multibox upto 10 accounts at any given time. 
---
I only started ten years ago with one account. CCP May have sped things up a little but this was always going to be the eve of the future, now if you limp dicked sissy pants would stop crying and having a tantrum and actually gave some constructive advice and/or adapt to the new conditions then maybe we can get past this quicker and see some results.
---
Literally who
---
They're not the same company now. 
---
I mean I was sitting with a bunch of isk and nothing to spend it on.
---
I had to buy a second character with gunnery skills so I could flying a different ship on fleets.
---
You should roll a new alt and get a feel for how long it takes to actually sit in any mainline ship.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ar678u/kings_of_lowsec_set_bleak_lands_ablaze_get_memed/
---
The concept of being "behind" or "catching up" to max skill players is stupid and needs to die. You dont need to fly every ship in this game, you dont need to train every skill for pvp, science, industry, whatever. You just dont. Expecting to is just dumb, and being able to pay to do it is even more dumb.
---
Badger Swarm Coalition?
---
&gt; I wish the Rorq wasn't a mining ship either
---
you and me both.
---
it seems obscene to me the best mining ship in the game is also the best ship at offering mining boosts, hauling ore, etc. i appreciate it was a useless piece of shit when offgrid boosting was a thing - now it has gone so far in the other direction that it as obsoleted every mining ship and most mining skills in the game.
---
i don't mind it being able to mine - and miner IIs should be more than sufficient.
---
excavators have really fucked things up, with regards to the balance between mining ships, and industrial command ships.
---
This is caused by several factors. People invested way too much time, effort and money over the years to simply leave and i cannot blame them. Another reason is the need to stay and protect w/e you have acomplished in all those years becouse once you leave others will come and stomp over the sandcastle of yours you have build so hard.
---
CCP is creating backdoors, which is clever. EVE turned into convincing new incomming players to subscribe as they dont mind the broken things. They dont give a fuck about rorqs, capitals, citadels, haw guns, jump fatigue or any other of the advanced features.
---
Missions work, hisec mining as well, hisec complexes too and low tier wormholes do too. Its as simple as that, number one rule for every empire to stay alive, feed your grunts, with what matters little, just keep them fed.
---
Thats the reason EVE will never die... unfortunately.
---
Context?
---
Don't not apologize, there isnt anyone good left anyways. Amirite boys?
---
who who and who?
---
You picked a single ship class and decided you didnt need to buy more ships or do anything else with your money. The only problem with your situation is you didnt want to play the game. You can shoot shit in ships you could fly already, you just didnt want to. Your entire argument is dumb, you just gave up flying things because you didnt have exactly what you wanted right at that moment. People like you are the reason skill injectors exist, and frankly they shouldve just told you to get over it and play the damn game instead of having everything handed to you right away because you wanted to pay for it instead. Ridiculous. Honestly cant believe you even came in with that weak shit.
---
If its got words, go for it.
---
I like how renters try to make up some Eve relevance. Please just die in balls of fire for our amusement. 
---
coincidentally, "empty bitching" is exactly how I'd describe your comment
---
QFC is a place for budding alliances to mature in a retro POS sov environment with some imposed rules of engagement. A throwback to a better time in EVE. Nobody's supposed to stay there forever. 
---
Great job DHSJ.  Really happy about getting the payback.  GG! 
---
As much as people might meme on this it's actually quality. I'm in the process of trying to start an entry level subcap roaming group in my Corp atm to whelp and die to other subcaps, and fully support anyone trying to do similar stuff and encourage/provide fun content 
---
Amen!
---
Aye and I'm still bothered by it, all this came out shortly after BOB's takedown of ASCN. The most devastating was how the knowledge of how the cluster handles connections was used in that war. 
---
I always wonder what would have come of EVE if ASCN were to survive into the later era with real industrial options. 
---
Not joking, this is what I've been most excited about for these past few years. A new release of Sarashawa Overview! Yay!! Much love 
---
Players need not concern themselves with such rarefied topics as the overall good of the game, although bad ones tend to dwell on it. I think CCP still have a couple of paid developers on staff for that. Players are here to play the game with all its politics and intrigues.
---
Don't you fret, all those titans will be ready and waiting for every op from now on.
---
That's fine, I have an entire flotilla of VNIs (5 ships total) waiting for them. 
---
I made this post in another thread, but it's relevant here too:
---
Well, CCP has shown off [Project Nova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXEo8v6MXGM)
---
&gt; "At EVE Vegas, we showed you the most recent iteration of our vision to provide an engaging and unique FPS experience to enrich the EVE Universe. Our goal for this was always to reinforce the ‚ÄòOne Universe // One War‚Äô gameplay and create a worthy spiritual successor to DUST 514 that has the potential to captivate not only existing Mercenaries and Capsuleers, but also to attract new adventurers into the ever-evolving world of New Eden. [source](https://www.ccpgames.com/projectnova)"
---
The also showed us [EVE: Echoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kw6BcQtszj0)
---
&gt; CCP Games is excited to formally unveil EVE: Echoes, a brand-new mobile spaceship sandbox MMO set in an alternate New Eden, the sci-fi universe of EVE Online. Players will be able to experience authentic EVE gameplay on their preferred mobile device and engage in interstellar combat, trade and exploration, as well as many other activities across thousands of star systems. Developed by NetEase Games in conjunction with CCP Games, EVE: Echoes will arrive on iOS and Android in 2019. [from video description]"
---
Both titles apparently directly tie into the EVE universe so that could be super cool. So we have a mobile MMO ... something, and a FPS that may be for PC this time and holy fuck that might actually work but no it won't because you and I both know they will go with a console for the safer money or some such bullshit instead of the painfully obvious PC crowd that would eat the shit up if it was anything like a successor to Dust. 
---
Hell, look at all the whales that are on Star Citizen. Nerds don't mind spending money on pixels, but you gotta make them fun/cool/something enough to hook us in. It seems CCP is really trying to do that, and I wish them luck. 
---
It's almost like no one wants snuff around.
---
This is pretty much how our group is (in the group with AB and such), instead of playing eve we‚Äôre mostly all playing APEX and other games. It‚Äôs sad because I remember so many good memories and people I‚Äôve met through the game, but it just sucks to see the direction go this way.
---
Number one newbie exploitation alliance in eve. Looked at their zkill a few weeks ago because I had never heard of them before to see 200 active characters and was like oh they‚Äôre actually pretty big. Turns out about 190 of them is not characters with kills but all losses - newbies losing ventures, mining barges and epithals in null. Recruiting straight out of newbie systems and the recruitment channel in game.
---
I legit feel so bad for anyone in this alliance.
---
it is a shame bro 
---
if is there something i could do to help with 
---
Roxxen is CEO of BSC a member of Theran Alliance in Winter Coalition. He was planning on kicking Hard Knocks from Colbalt Edge but has now been kicked out of Theran and Theran is saying BSC members can join Theran and leave BSC.
---
Does perpetual gatecamping qualify as interesting subcap pvp?
---
Having talked with CCP devs at Vegas I can understand this. Honestly chatting with them about the state of the game was reassuring, they know what some of the issues are and even have some good ideas to solve them. I left Vegas super hopeful. The problem is, it then seems they're powerless to actually address these things further down the road. Sure they might understand it, but they don't seem to be permitted the freedom to work on it. 
---
The backwards thing there is that Wild Geese.  were shooting everyone. Why you gotta pile us on snuff side. 
---
A mini-game to mine?
---
Would make botting a lot harder, and would increase prices on ore... which would increase prices for a lot of stuff, but also making lots of things more difficult while forcing more interaction with a function that is supremely needed (mining).
---
Hmmm... I kinda like it.
---
at least 1 scout (2 ideal in a pipe system)
---
1 looter
---
rest gankers
---
maller/vexor/tornado gank industrials
---
but good luck, eve is dead and highsec is even deadder, most of the good gankers straight up quit because everyone just hauls in teleporting jfs now
---
Yeah, I totally just made a one line cynical comment that contains no arguments and zero supporting points.
---
It's obvious whose comments are empty, mine or yours.

Would like to go ahead and add Joecuster to the list of Snuff self-destructs during that fight. Was in disbelief at first when I saw a Archon killmail randomly popup in my kill log mid fight.

Damn USTZ getting too uppity, right lads, the euro bro's will show you how to give the local trash a spanking.
---
&gt; People like you are the reason r/eve (and internet communities in general) suck. You contribute without contributing anything. Just quit Eve and go play some other game if you think there's no solution to anything. There's no reason for empty bitching.
---
Um, you see the irony here? Maybe look in a mirror before calling out others.
---
Oh, so multiple lines make it acceptable. Ok.
---
There. Line two.
---
See, not empty at all. In fact it must be super insightful because there's *three* lines. Wow!
---

I mean, sure, if you enjoy fleets large and monotone enough that any individual contribution on your part is meaningless, yeah.
---
For real, I just joined EVE again after a few failed attempts to learn the game... join the subreddit and its like a forum for who can write the longest, whiniest, bitchiest post possible.  
---
I get it. Its an MMO and you feel like you put so much into it that your voice matters... 
---
It doesn't.  And no matter how many words your post on reddit is... your voice still doesn't matter.

Why are Mach‚Äôs used for smartbombing so much? They don‚Äôt seem to have any bonuses for that
---
Whining about the whiners is the new meta
---
Any large alliance with a decently dedicated IT team can probably track any Icelandic IP's and might know but its not really worth the effort exposing them. 
---
Well if their choice is "CCPlease" for suggestions on how to make their game better or "EVE is dying" which would be the end of their game, I'd choose the first option too.
---
You already answered your question (but you knew that).  I would love to see EVE be a better game and 64-bit is a great improvement, but I think CCP is dealing with a lot more than just the software side of things holding it down.  
---
*looks around*
---
Tis a silly place. Let us leave and never return.
---
shrek week? I can do shrek week.

They have the biggest in-game model, and since smartbomb AoE is measured from the edge of that model, it gives you the most range.

I would totally keep it.

I can understand that Sony had paid for exclusivity. But I think that in the longterm they could have done better with it on PC
---
They will never remove injectors.
---
people say those things because they care, i do not know when caring about something you love and being vocal about it has become a problem.
---
maybe some of them are rude, maybe not, does not matter, what matters is that they are voicing their frustration showing that they care.
---
slurping up whatever disappointment they give you is not the right approach.

I see your post but I am afraid your voice does not matter.

LoL, SNUFF got their asses kicked. That's what you get for not playing Anthem with me.
---
people aren't simply crying because they're spending money on other things
---
they're crying because eve has been needing major overhauls for a long time and a lot of fixes over pretty much every recent change and instead of making progress on these things we get:
---
1) UI REWORK 7.0!!! STILL NO COLOR
---
2) AT CANCELLED THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE CAN'T PAY ANYONE TO DO IT
---
QFC serves 3 purposes for the GSF: Meatshield ; Recruitment proving ground for corps/alliances ; Content area for their bored pilots. 
---
Supercapitals ARE allowed. Buying supers from GSF and selling them to anybody outside of GSF is against GSF rules.
---
Those are the facts. Now put on your favorite tinfoil hats for some theories. I know its forbidden on the internet, but I'll try to use some common sense and logic.
---
The 'official' reason was that S.R leadership had goon alt which they used to get supers for the alliance. This answer was given after hours and hours of everybody contacting QFC leadership and asking for answers, so it feels more like something that was just thrown out there as a screen, rather than a real thing - this is backed up by many people with insight or pretending to have insight on the situation saying that its not the real reason. It also doesnt make sense for this to be it, when every QFC alliance has members in goons and most, if not all, the supers in QFC were made by goons (so S.R is not the only alliance doing this). Fem was transparent about his activities and half the GSF knew about these for a good 1 or more years.
---
Goons want alliances in QFC but none of them should become too big or powerful - Querious has a glass ceiling. We're blue with goons when it matters (sov, citadel defending/bashing) but red in our spare time. Its a good setup, as it serves the purpose of providing content for both sides, really close to home. But if one of those alliances gets bigger and bigger, even if unorganized, it becomes a threat - not in a true sense ofc, since 120 active people wont ever pose real danger to a 30k man coalition... but if those 120 were to become organized and started dropping capitals or bombers deep in GSF space, their own carebears would bitch and moan if too much damage is done. Take it a step further and consider that such an alliance could eventually get approached by GSF enemies and get recruited or convinced to give said enemies a foothold in Querious.  S.R was told by QFC leadership, during an op, about two months, that we have the numbers and ships to roll over anybody else in the QFC or even all of them combined - all we needed to get was more fleet discipline. Now, we had no intentions of rolling over anybody, BUT we had started working towards a more militarized alliance for the last 2 weeks, with a new doctrine being created, enforcing new rules that would lead to people being organized in pvp. Then this came out of the blue. 
---
Now lets switch to a goon perspective. What do you do in this situation? An alliance that you see as a pet is steadily growing near you and you have info that they are getting more organized all of a sudden...You still want their members around, since you need Querious to be populated in order to maintain the meat shield. This alliance has not broken QFC rules so you cut off the head that is organizing them, by invoking a rule everyone in QFC is breaking...all the while going around and encouraging other alliances that are left in QFC to poach members from S.R. You maximize your chances of the main body of players within that alliance getting poached by giving literally 0 warning to what you are about to do and 0 time for them to move assets. Standard shock and awe tactic. I give credit where credit is due... because it worked very well for them. 
---
The dust will settle in a week or two, and anybody who had a bigger vision than being a goon pet will have left, while the remaining QFC members will keep their heads down, hoping that somebody other than them will have their head on the chopping block the next time goons need to make an example of somebody.
---
A salute to all who came in wix pocket looking for a fight. Yeah..we were a far cry from being elite, but we were working on it...and at least we undocked for a fight :)
---
T'was fun. o7

I would react, but on mobile its already 4 lines and its so full of information I have trouble comprehending it. Can someone make a two lines max version for me?

I can't believe all that happened from my stupid Astrahaus's armor timer.....

Well I mean any self respecting Eve entity has a single token Icelander, for when flags need to be stolen off CCP‚Äôs roof and such

As opposed to staying ahead by using their accumulated wealth to stay ahead even more.

Bur then he needs to pay too or give account data. Welp. Would pay the money, too, though

How old are you?

Wtf I logged in and there‚Äôs all these people playing, didn‚Äôt they get your memo???
---
&gt; it was meant to help new people out
---
then why are they 900m isk each?
---
they are meant to extract as much $$ from the player base as possible.
---
1. When CCP tries anything else the only thing they accomplish is to innovate their way directly into the dumpster.
---
2. It‚Äôs not a bitter vet thing, I‚Äôve only been following the game closely for about two years and just in that time the nosedive the game has taken is astounding.

3. Praising, pleading, bargaining, and offering innovative and helpful solutions have all been tried ad nauseam, to no effect. Bitching is a lot easier, and apparently has the same effect so vOv

If you don‚Äôt put in minimal effort I‚Äôm afraid eve is not for you.

Pretty sure it's a junior school kid thing to think that writing more, even if it's content less and vapid, providing no value or further insight, make them better and more intelligent than the other kids. 
---
should've seen it 2 years ago, had double the playerbase
---
Have you played EVE as a new character? Mine is quite old but I tried to bring a friend on and realized how truly awful the new experience is.
---
Snuff getting owned right after kicking me. For an Indian Hy has no idea how karma works!
---
"years ago" I started in 2012, when those who played since the beginning could've already flown everything including titans. The best time in my gaming life was to learn new things and train into new ships. If people join EVE and want immediately to "pwn n00bz", then I'm afraid they deserve exactly the same answer we all received: HTFU.
---
South Ireland! South Ireland! South Ireland! South Ireland! 
---
&gt;There was never a "free eazy kills" in Eve. It was always hard and worked for. You're clueless.
---
The only hard thing with that is finding the targets and tackling them. Yeah, super hard. You had to work for it. Yeah. 
---
&gt;Local is "the one thing" that allows you to survive? Here's a tip. Align to a citadel. Warp off. That's literally all you need to do. 2 clicks.
---
And what would you do if there is no citadel because capable players killed it? Whoops. 
---
&gt;You have the inherit advantage of numbers, the fact that you are in your home territory, the fact that you have all your resources in reach to fight.
---
Because of the alliance, yes. You can take that away. Then you have the advantage in your favor. 
---
&gt; Who is this mythical lone krab out in the depths of 0.0 all by himself without an alliance being kept alive by local? 
---
Ever heard of the term "Renters" which are just that by definition cause they receive no support from their landlord? 
---
&gt;Must be the 5th or 6th time I've told you I don't proclaim myself as "elite pvper." 
---
You argue the same way. :) 
---
&gt;Um dude you have "all the tools" to fight pvpers back. Just fly a PVP ship with a small gang man. You have all the tools right there.
---
Yeah and how would I do PvE in that? :) 
---
&gt;How about a module that provides local we can entosis. 15 minute cycle. Goes offline. Someone has to go to it to entosis it in order to work again. Fair?
---
Yeah, that would be nice to have. Something that provokes fights and something that has a warning and can be countered. I like it. 
---
&gt;Fuck why didn't I think of that. Thanks man. Truly showing the best ideas here.
---
Again, the idea is not that "kill down the Alliance" is feasible for you with your limited ressources. The argument is you can't touch local because in the absence of an alliance, the "Krab" would have nothing while you have the utmost advantage. Since "having no alliance" is a real possibility (there are people that don't live under an umbrella), the result of removing local would simply make all these systems dead (more dead than already). This leads to less PvE in there and subsequently: less PvP too. 
---
Why is that? because PvP activity increases with the ammount of PvE activity. You said it yourself, killing crabs "isn't exiting but it's a try to provoke fights" and that right there should tell you that other PvP'ers (which you seek to fight) aren't interested in fighting you. So, your idea of "with less krabs in space, more PvPers will want to fight PvP'ers" is a house of cards because if you can't provoke them by touching they juwelry, what makes you think that you will get them to fight once their juwelry is savely stored up and out of your reach? 
---
&gt;It's a problem all those other advantages that have been added in the game in recent years that it produced. 
---
Yes exactly, so what makes you think removing the only advantage that is able to counter the agressors advantages is the way to counter that?
---
I'll adress both your posts at the same time btw. 
---
&gt;Your idea of "something" that I could do is get my own 50k member alliance and hit it with dreads. Not really a solution for small gang groups.
---
To kill keepstars with dreads you only need a dozen people and some dread alts. You don't need similar numbers at all. 
---
&gt;Correlation is not causation. Does it ring now? :D 
---
Oh, I know that for a while, you seem to just doesn't understand how this works in EvE. 
---
&gt;Yes you can kill and take them away....if you have thousands of people in your alliance. Small gangs don't.
---
So your argument is "I can't assemble enough people". Rhetorical question: do you think using a, let's say a 12 man gang to drop a VNI is balanced? Couldn't the victim claim it's unfair because he doesn't have the option of bringing help because he is a solo player and it needs to be balanced around this fact? Would you argue that CCP buffs would simply make his VNI able to deal with a gang of 10/100/1000/10000/100000 in order to deal with his self inflicted handicap? 
---
&gt;The point is krabs have had an increase in advantages that favor them without anything given to the small gang players.
---
and that is undeniably true. I never argued against that. I argued against removing local because of it because you can, infact, remove all the other advantages. If you want to make life easier for small gangs, removing local has severe consequences for everyone that isn't in alliance that protects it's members and doesn't solve the issues you have. 
---
The issues are: You don't have the wealth, you don't have the people because if you would have, you wouldn't have the problems you've mentioned earlier. Fact is: even if you don't like bringing bigger numbers =&gt; if you would have the wealth, you could compensate that too. 
---
So, I don't believe just for one second that the solution is to nerf anything. The solution is to get you in the position to do what you can do right now in theory: Burn Alliances down. And that's purely a wealth question. I mean, you, at the moment, brought up an example where, even though you have 50 bil on your wallet, couldn't bring a tool adequate to tackle a rorqual (Sabre, around 100mil). I mean, you could have, but you chose to not do so. Why is that? Because getting wealthy is hard if you don't crab and you need to preserve the isk in order to get max fun/isk. 
---
And that's fair and all, your playstyle. However, it's a playstyle that causes problems too - you are faced with advantages you can't break with "conserving" isk and if CCP gets you into a position where you can easily afford to lose a super while not having to worry as much about how you replace it, then I think THAT would truly help. 
---
&gt;No it wasn't. And the appeal of Eve is destroying stuff that is hard to replace. So you flying around with 30 mil Caracals that are insured and welping 300 of them isn't "fun." It's empty noise.
---
So, for you it's only worth playing if you can kill stuff the enemy can't replace and that's fair and all, but not a general rule. 
---
&gt;Where am I afraid to expose 100 mil in ships? Where are you getting these figures from? Put your Nyx in Geminate and see how it goes.
---
well, when you can't even commit to having adequate tools to prevent rorquals from warping off (a bubble), then I can't see any other explanation for that other than "you are just dumb" and I don't think you don't. Why do complain about rorquals warping off when you've made no attempt at tackling them to begin with, is either just a bad example or leads to the conclusion you don't wanted to commit a dictor. 
---
&gt;I'll give you an example. Prior to citadels we used to lock down the grid of a station with stop bubbles and dictors. The defenders would undock, chase us off and we'd have a back and forth fighting. Now you can't even do that anymore. Citadel insta blaps you with point defense, or tackles you to ungodly ranges. There's no counter play. And "just bring your own 50k alliance lol" is a dumb suggestion. It really shows your limited experience.
---
When it takes a dozen people with a ton of isk to kill a defended keepstar, then your argument is invalid. You have this kind of hit and run guerilla playstyle at your disposal, but you chose to not do it this way because it's too expensive. Don't get me wrong, I now small gangs have suffered, but using an inadequate and flat out wrong baseline (you can't do anything against it) as an argument for nerfs is ridiculously stupid. 
---
The problem is not "you can't do anything against it". Your problem is: "It requires more numbers than you want to commit to" and/or "It is too expensive". As I've said in the other thread - you are trying to kill tanks with simple bullets but you can't afford an RPG either. The tools are there, you simply can't afford them and that is the core problem. 
---
&gt;No we don't need more PVEers in space. We need more people period. If I'm in a krabbing ship and I'm watching local, how are you going to catch me? Tell me. Go ahead. Explain it to me.
---
I could go with the obvious answer of: Logintraps, Spy-Alt-Awoxing etc. but I don't really want that, instead I would like to know: 
---
why do you think avoiding a fight is problematic? Isn't small gang all about avoiding fights you can't win while picking the fights you can win? Why is it a problem if the krab can do that just like you do all the freaking time? Why shouldn't the krab be able to avoid the fight with you? EXPLAIN this to me. 
---
To me, it sounds like you are entitled to the idea that you can chose who lives and who dies. It doesn't work this way. 
---
&gt;Once again 
---
you try to defend the wrong argument. You do have all the options that you need available and yes, bringing 1000 titans is nothing that you couldn't do - thus, it IS an option. You just chose to not commit to it. The argument is: "it's too hard for me to do that and it's unfair that life was made easier for krabs when my solutions only got tougher to execute". 
---
Yes, arguing that it's too hard for you to do is a different argument altogether, but a fair one. Crying that you can't isn't. 
---
&gt; Do I go tell you how much spod you need to mine to make railguns or whatever you do? MERs don't back your argument up
---
Yes you do. You want to force your idea of balance onto me even though you obviously don't have a clue about how I play the game and which problems I face doing that. You want to change the game in your favor so you can force me out of my playstyle more. In a sense, you are a hypocrit. I don't want your game to be tougher, I realize your playstyle has problems and I would like to adress that, just in a way that recognizes the problems it will cause. You know, just like changes should be mad. Not the CCP way, I know. 
---
Bob you've really out-done yourself on this one.
---
Searched up sentry drones but getttig come conflicting answers. Say I want to eat in havens with my rattlesnake or do some escalations. Should I use sentry or heavy drones? When do I use them? How should I use them?
---
...cause they sit in highsec mining in hulks.
---
Was just thinking to myself about needing some good AARS lately. Thanks
---
AFAIK only the sellar  needs to pay but don‚Äôt quote me since I‚Äôve never actually don‚Äôt a character transfer :p
---
You are correct, you got the message through loud and clear.
---
It‚Äôs like those people who are most angry are new at this game or something.
---
This game never had good balance no matter how hard CCP tried, because us shitbird players scope out the most OP ships, doctrines and tactics every time they do one of their few and far between balance patches and the meta basically revolves around what‚Äôs most OP.
---
Nobody who remembers the dual mwd era, gankageddons, the wcs years (they had no disadvantage), the nano years, slowcats or AHACs should be surprised CCP are shit at developing their game, but they _are_ trying.
---
I‚Äôve already ‚Äúbiomassed‚Äù once over monoclegate and 2 years later I was strapping up my arm once again and filling a needle with some sweet grade A black tar Eve.
---
Don‚Äôt make my mistake over CCP coming across as detached monkeys, they tend to eventually do the right thing.
---
Yeah but he wont pay 20 to give sth away for free, so i would be the one paying in the end. A shame i cant do it with plex anymore
---
gf bois, looking forward to next rounds :D 
---
Because everyone in the world is a native Eng speaker.
---
Stop being silly.
---
But the SNUFF reddit posters told me they only dropped 4 titans on my Astrahus last time to make it go faster because my 17 man corp didn't fight... 
---
but .... but .... but ....
---
Dude that tune is banging. o7 
---
Depends on how you're aggressed. Large group crashes you, and suddenly you joking and start frantically listening to FC
---
You‚Äôre getting conflicting answers because it depends and some is personal preference. The optimal way to do escalations depends on the escalation you got. They have different ones depending on which pirate faction it is. 
---
For ratting I‚Äôd never use a rattlesnake as it‚Äôs just drop bait and the minimal increase in ticks from a VNI aren‚Äôt worth that but if you must I would use heavy drones still because sentries will have an awful hard time tracking frigates if they get in close. 
---
lmfao you retard
---
Why do I see this post then? Smh mods. 
---
Well it was a few months in 2017 when there were around 45k max logged in instead of 35k max like today, because of alpha hype
---
Sadly most players don‚Äôt like Eve but I‚Äôm glad they tried, and that some of them stuck around
---
i'm discounting the bots and alts in the pcu counts
---
Made me Eve hard. Gonna go log in
---
Heck, even the enemies are friendly. As a newbro, I always feel like talking crap, but then they say nice stuff and Im reminded what Im playing again.
---
But you're not a skilled streamer. So this argument goes out of the window. 
---
They used to be few and far between. Suddenly everybody with ISK can make multiple characters to fly Rorqs. Massive influx of materials, cheaper ships (particularly caps and supercaps) and it gets worse from there. Corps/alliances providing free titans to new members sounds like fun but it's broken. Now Eve is what it is and it isn't fun.
---
Nice work as always. Thanks for the time and effort.
---
For the sake of argument, I'm going to spell things out for you:
---
&gt;Yeah, I totally just made a one sentence cynical comment **that contains no arguments and zero supporting points.**
---
That second half of the sentence was the key part of my point, as would be evident to anyone with a good comprehension of english. I think it's very clear that my point was about adding *multiple ideas* to a discussion as opposed to mere length, but you chose to zoom in on the two words "one line".
---
That's the reason I asked your age. The way chose to respond with is what most people would call "pedantic": you're deliberately nitpicking a less relevant detail to try to fit a point you want to make.
---
People who have reached a certain degree of maturity learn to avoid arguments like that, because they learn quickly that other people can see through it and they won't be taken seriously. Really, I remember acting the way you're acting now when I was much younger.
---
If you're not a junior school kid now, it's clear you're not far off that age and I see debating with you further as a waste of my time.
---
Good luck to you.
---
Well, I use reddit, the official forums, in-game eve mail, discord, my personal email, my CSM email, I attend fan events locally and EVE Vegas, and I appear on a variety of podcasts and twitch streams, including co-hosting Open Comms. I'm the most accessible dude on the CSM and there's plenty of face to face interaction with other players. 
---
Start from post you wrote cuz it looks like low effort attention whoring
---
Completely ruined the game, I echo the other posts here. It didn't take that long to get into something decent and the time it did take let you learn and explore the game a bit more. There are other factors that I won't go into but EVE may not be dead, but the cancer has set in and is in the bloodstream. I've dropped 2 subs this past month and will probably play out the Plex etc I've got before I resub if I do at all. The game has become something I don't look forward to launching anymore.
---
Do you really believe this? LOL
---
The introduction of injectors is by far the worst addition to the game ever. Alpha accounts being second and fozzie sov a close third.
---
It's true, adapt or die. We are choosing death. You're wrong on the second part; established players *are* more important than new players. It's us who build alliances, run fleets, and create content. Eve Online is a sandbox where the content is made by the players, for the players. Without us, there'd be no content and the game would wither and die, which is exactly what's happening. I see FCs and content creators leave monthly, but rarely new blood step up to take their place. I'm not sure if there's just not enough new players or a shift in mentality, but that hardly matters. Once the death spiral begins, there's no stopping it.

Good fight. Spod AAR.

How long did this take you to make? Are the specs loosely based upon in-game info or lore or did you just make up some of the names?

Cool stuff, would love to see more! Like my forever love the Rupture &lt;3. 
---
I gave an example of how he could contribute meaningfully to a discussion while still stating his general sentiment, instead of just coming back with a one-line response that discourages other people from making meaningful posts that they had to put thought into.
---
The only thing I'm seeing here is a pedant choosing to zoom in one part of what I'm saying in order to spin a particular point.
---
Being salty about snuff is kinda my defining characteristic.  If eve was Westworld and I was an android thingy, it would be my "anchor". 
---
&gt;See: brave vs pl. as the most recent example.
---
Huh?
---
What?
---
As long as theyt are no caught they are a fine.
---
I have to admit that the content-creation aspect is a strong argument I haven‚Äòt thought of.
---
join a Wormhole corp

wormhole is best game

look for NaturalPhenomenon
---
Whining about people whining about eve became uncool years ago too
---
&gt;Without us, there'd be no content and the game would wither and die, which is exactly what's happening.
---
The game is withering and dying because of the chat debacle, bugs and staleness. And new blood doesn't step up because of this toxicity and entitlement that comes with beeing a "content creator". The sooner all those corps that train new players into thinking they own something to "content creators" the better. 
---
Hmm... lets see. 
---
~No QFC rules broken by S.R. 
---
~S.R director broke only one GSF rule which also everybody else breaks..so that cant be the reason. I dont see every QFC alliance being kicked. Also, if that were the real reason, you would have kicked his alt out of goons and asked him to resign from S.R command, instead of banning all S.R officers to stay in QFC and continue leading the alliance where it was going.
---
~Purposeful vagueness about the whole reason (both to kicked people and rest of QFC), and a sketchy one given after hours of being asked by everybody -oh, one that is denied by your own people as being the real reason as well.
---
Yeah..i'd say the initial theory is believable. Afterall, why would goons be vague or self-contradicting about this whole thing if there wasnt anything shady happening behind it all?
---
But feel free to prove me wrong and enlighten the rest of us with the truth.
---
Same thing since 2006: Cloaky afk camping ruins everything. It's never changed and this bitter vet with 200m+ SP says it's the fix to eve. Here we are 13 years later talking about how to fix eve... It's ripple will be far reaching and ultimately good ( many growing pains included) .
---
Idk how long it took exactly, roughly 2 weeks. Most of the info is from the Frigates of EVE book which I highly recommend. I spliced in my own flavor text for the new parts of the ship I added.
---
Adapt or die, learn this noob. If you adapt a fish to have lungs and it turns into a whale you sharks can still eat it. A shark can't eat a fucking elephant and it won't

Also fuck you and your troll post
---
Taka always the good guy.
---
How is it possible to instalock and alpha ships with 4 accounts without input broadcasting?
---
You can just sell the characters - you don't have to extract you know.
---
Lmao this is great. The clickbait we didnt know we needed.
---
Injectors and Plex have certainly made it worse.  It used to only be a handful of characters now one person can lock down whole regions.  Nothing against people using game mechanics but this one needs to have a counter of some description.
---
Yes that's what forum moderators actually do.

This argument is essentially

better do a shark year and we re done with the useless spam :)
---
Interesting. Not had that issue come up yet and everything seemed fine this morning. I'll keep an eye out for the problem
---
Thx CCP
---
Chat has been a pain in the arse but I don't believe it's a major factor.  Staleness, abusable mechanics (eg cloaky camping, empire ganking), super cap spam, the relentless move towards "super-sized" alliances.
---
They are factors and a good chunk of the issue lies with the playerbase and its progressively making the game less fun and interesting.  That being said CCP needs to get off its arse, stop "significant" new content development and spend a year or two fixing what's already there.  It's been done before and it was widely considered one of the best moves they ever made, it just needs to become part of the regular development cycle.

anyone who thinks these minor features that should have rolled out with the citadel patch itself are ccp actually working on things ur a mistake and reddit was a mistake

yep,been in the rookie channel alot lately and noticed how many newbies are scammed into joining Theran.
---
 Want to know why player retention suffer so much in EVE, its corps like these.
---
They aint renters as much as  brand new players with no idea what they are doing.
---
So do i.

Can't get an idea of pilot skill by looking at üé≠ birthday anymore.

&gt; It's true, adapt or die. We are choosing death
---
You've obviously never heard "die quietly" 
---
One siege/triage cycle was your life expectancy, so about 10 minutes before the slowcat blob hits grid.
---
More so that the basic logistics of living in wh are a pain in the arse for new types dipping their toes in the water and the C1-C3 holes they should be starting out in aren't really worth living in. The half-competent upstart groups you'd hope to see more of go where the money is and atm wormholes are way, way down that list.

/r/bravenewbies
---
Rorquals are by far the best thing that has ever happened to mining. 
---
The people moaning are almost exclusively the small gang types who are bitching that there is a crabboat that has a meaningful tank, which is hardly surprising considering that for more than a decade pve boats were completely helpless and the small gang types have been habituated that if you can't kill a mining boat then there has to be something wrong with the game.

Well you are some days to late , the AT train is already gone .. you now need go onto the ‚Äûbiomass your character and give away your stuff ‚Äû train 
---
He's literally communicating with you now, wtf do you expect, a personal phone call?
---
Possibly the dumbest part of injectors is that they have effectively tied CCPs revenue to the balance of the game.
---
good job ccp, literally 12 years in the making?
---
Tl;dr.
---
And a lot of the autists believed it was the same. Pretty sad.
---
It's not that hard lol
---
Injectors did speed up the pace at which CCP needed to respond to issues, like the Rorq and other stuff. Seeing as they move at a glacial pace, not a good thing.
---
&lt;3
---
Bitch what?
---
I played EVE. I tried to become an FC. For years, mind you. And I was close, once. Ran a couple small roams. Sometimes unsuccesfully, but hey, shit happens. I wanted more, and was consistently pushed down.
---
It was not met with "oh yeah we'll train you for that, awesome!"  
---
It was met with "Fuck you noob we're not gonna listen to you" \*que autistic screeching\*  
---
Because god forbid if the status quo is upset and NEW STUFF and NEW PEOPLE happen. God. The horrors would be indescribable.  
---
On top of that, you have any idea of the impact your usual "recruitment" has on people? You have to share your API. Then when they find one little anomaly you get interviewed, have to send your response in triplicate to the recruiter, the corp director's nephew, and the alliance leader's grandma's three-legged cat. Because "spies".  
---
I had plenty of friends who wanted to play, honest people, and we put through that torture and they noped right the fuck out.
---
It's people like that who kill the game. There are plenty of people who are willing to stand up and begin creating content, but plenty of "bitter vets" are too scared that it will affect them negatively that they'd rather not see that happen at all and would prefer to revel in their own toxic cesspool.
---
Remember the whole local chat being fucked thing?
---
There were DOZENS of posts fanboying CCP for handling it well in that thread, from "You guys reacted quickly" to "Thanks for your outstanding communication".
---
Neither of these things occurred.
---
Local chat had been completely fucked for several months over the 11 month period the new chat system had been implemented, and inconsistent at best over the rest.
---
CCP was radio silent the entire time until mid January when they gave us the 'fix it or revert it' ultimatum outside of ONE time they gave us 250,000 SP [Side note: Falcon did say they'd reimburse us once the issue was resolved, but of course was another lie as the issue wasn't even resolved]. 
---
It took CCP nearly a year to finally fix something that had always been a non-issue for eve, and even now it's still not flawless. There are still times when local chat will go down (especially in places like Jita) so even now it's not at 100% (although it's a lot better).
---
But I'm glad it happened the exact way it did, because local being broken showed us how bad the botting problem is, when over 600 VNIs bots were killed in a several hour period when local was down globally. This number is actually insane realizing that these are only the ones that got caught. All the exploration bots, the highsec abyssal runner bots and distribution bots and facwar bots probably bump up the PCU by 20%. 
---
For the Horde!!
---
Falcon lied to us?! I'm am truly shocked!!! 
---
Im basically using the t2 version of this fit for t4 darks. If you are gonna do t5 i would recommend blinging that nosferatu to a dark blood one, just to be a little more safe from neuts.
---
And some pyrolance drugs is probably a good idea too
---
it's his job to be the community ""manager"", i'm sure he's a decent guy outside of work
---
well haven't used pacifier myself either, but seen some camping hacking sites. Sure it takes time but if you have a web it helps a lot. Also faction drones have even more hp than t2's. But yeah, you will add extra couple minutes to the fight, so it's clearly not a quick gank if you choose to take out the drones.
---
PH or any of the big newbro groups are good places to start, just keep in mind you can kinda be lost and be part of the machine with how many people are around. If you join look at what niche activities some people do and join them.
---
Nice essay
---
Meh. Was hoping to see this on our forums before I saw it on reddit. Now those filthy goonies get to put forth even less effort at being pro. 
---
I dont lol
---
Do you think I'm arguing that rorquals aren't OP? I've gone on record many times saying that they obviously are.
---
sure, google my flair
---
feels that way sometimes eh ;)
---
CCP knocks off the last 0.  See guys told you we were working on balance instead of AT.
---
Also good post
---
I remember, it was the best r/eve content ever. I was hoping they would stay gone.
---
I think youre nit picking, both of those enemy fleets need to engage at range. So they start trying to pull range, but they start dying. Then they start peeling. 
---
In terms of what you expect from a fleet fight video? this follows the same format as a lot I've seen. It puzzles me how you point out the format as a way of constructively criticizing. 
---
Down vote because its true
---
How are them fleets in horde going? 
---
And are encouraged to plot the downfall of entire empires or federations. For a while rumours has it that they were running casinos, but that has since been disallowed.
---
Its today, and not the future. So what is your point? The future and tomorrow are the times when everything is completed and everything is possible. The possibilities are endless and limitless, but CCP has yet to harness the power of control of the future.
---
Suddenly our 50v50 fleet GSF FC tournaments with ISK limits on ship competitions seem even more interesting. Maybe we can charge for the tickets, and have the crowd watching under the gazeful eye of a hundred BFGs to avoid any incidents.
---
A sandbox provides the tools and environment in which to flourish. Natural content and leadership will rise up if the sandbox is truly cared for. If this doesnt happen, its not the players that are broken, but the sandbox.
---
you can get smartbombed in warp, not just coming out of it. You have to make bookmarks using a ship with identical warp speed, then have perfect timing. there's a video on youtube i'll try to find.
---
No, you need to train the jump bridge skill. Then you need to disable the enemy ship without destroying it, and send a boarding party. If you succeed you take over the precious ship and all the modules. Plus and exotic dancers and drugs, of course.
---
Business 101 is to do a feasability study before sinking $30mil into a project.
---
Yes yes, never listen to anyone but youselves :D i am just already for 10+ yrs in this game and did everything, so there is nothing that keeps me playing
---
&gt; Didnt help goons had the most bots in their umbrella
---
I thought the drone regions had the most bots.
---
But but but I got 20 free covetor pilots, yahh the injectors needs to go. 
---
Or in Delve mining in Rorqs.
---
AAR: Fuck Nina.
---
Sounds like the corporations you were playing with weren't the right fit. And if you can't find one but want to create content you can create your own that lives up to these expectations.
---
It's a good day in Placid.
---
I mean that experience entirely depends on the groups you're in. I met a few bad groups until I came across DHSJ and eventually also Spectre Fleet which I ended up leading for years.
---
Just because you had a bad experience and went through some of the more autistic groups doesn't mean much at all.
---
&gt;elite lowsec
---
&gt;conoco
---
Yeah... this^
---
Lol. So going from a CCP that has steadily declined in it's performance, provably so:
---
- Worse events every time
---
- AT dead
---
- Constant shift towards monetization goals (mining blobs in big sov blocs)
---
- No balance updates
---
That isn't being a bittervet, that's just seeing CCP being a pile of shit and calling it quits.
---
Good write-up. 
---
Good to hear you're ok again!
---
I think you just described why I stopped playing. Getting too focused on the isk-pr-hour, always pressing for the big ambitions, bigger ships, bigger fleets. I did try to bring it back down again, but that ended up as a solo game and me leaving. 
---
GF fam :)
---
Dear Newbie.   
---
Reddit isn't a place to have good conversations about EvE (maybe you can if you endure initial hostility towards you). It's a place used to develop and strengthen narratives.   
---
You can safely assume that everyone has an agenda of some sort. Either one that suits his playstyle or one that purely destroys other peoples playsytels. Often both at the same time.   
---
If you take this to heart, this subreddit will never disappoint you anymore.   
---
They will NEVER be removed. Sadly.
---
DEM FIGHTING WORDS
---
1) Would probably be less bitching if they weren't shit at it :P Seriously CCP blow at making games. Everyone who made eve and made it great is long gone, everyone left are just meh caretakers with delusions of grandeur now. As much as it pains them CCP has no legacy beyond EvE because they're shit at making games :|
---
smugging about blobbing a structure :joy: 
---
I did not care enough to post until a couple days passed. Wanted to make sure the rest of the slackers biomass too, so I mustered the energy to post.
---
This is the best thing 
---
EVE is truly fucked if it turns out to be a whole bunch of philantropist fuckers pretending to playing the game all along.
---
Buzz, buzz. 
---
What corps are providing free titans to new members? Uhh, asking for a friend.
---
There are groups out there with the correct level of ambition / casual mix :) hope you try again sometime.
---
Who are you?
---
It's understandable : )
---
O U R Z A D
---
I'm typing this on my non eve account (i.e. porn account) to not get in conflict with my friends. But I've been a part of a smaller corp for a few years, and until I met the CCP employee at Fanfest I had no idea that the person was a member of our corp. This is a corp where everybody knows each other fairly well so it says something about how ¬´secret¬ª it can be.
---
When I first moved to null I used injectors so I could fly doctrine ships with friends... Maybe instead of diminishing returns there should have been a hard cap on injectors so peeps could use them to do something like that. Like say 20 mill sp only and then the character cant use them again...
---
What's the thing at the end? 
---
OK it's not just me.
---
Same, bookmarked a sign before DT, not here anymore, no one signs in 5 systems
---
I have 3 new friends who play and I have a brand new alpha. Its not bad. They dont mind at all, maybe because they arent whiny children.
---
Fixed now :) phew
---
The deelitization of the game and the salts of consequence
---
kugu would likely not have been any kinder ;P
---
Woah, for a second you we're going to have to stop crabbing, crisis averted!
---
As far as I remember it always took some time after DT for the anoms/sigs to load. 
---
Posts about Stargate and Farscape are still ok though right?
---
Thanks, never experienced this before
---
Thank you Sir, I will keep that in mind o7
---
Don‚Äôt you have to like... boat the JF to Jita thru fuckin highsec?
---
and then if you see gankers in system you can...
---
teleport out
---
That's not a real aar
---
Never knew that CONOCO is considered l33t..
---
The nullsec nerf, finaly
---
Making the harvester drones more viable would be a good option.
---
 Atm its 2b for a full set and they are as squishy as augmented drones, but slower. Literally 5 seconds of some frig rats and they are dead.
---
If they would be cheaper and tankier it would make it reasonable to use them.
---
It's bad, its infact absolutely shit. It takes 12 months of skilling just to be able to fly like cruisers and interceptors and shit. I'm not talking about max skills, im talking about getting the skills barely above usable levels
---
weird flex
---
what an amazing post, I bet it was a gripping victory right from the jaws of defeat! Tell me more about it in the form of a three paragraph AAR.
---
UPVOTED FOR CONTENT THIS IS WHAT THIS SUBREDDIT IS ALL ABOUT BOYOS
---
Wow, you are a really terrible poster. Have you ever considered quitting reddit?
---
This is good. 
---
Frigates of Eve is a thing isn't it?
---
So you are telling me you won against snuff while completly outnumbering them? You are so good.
---
absolutely noone wants roxxen lol
---
first he gets kicked out of a HS island like a year and half ago then comes back to the same island a few months ago and gets hazed by TMOCC until he leaves to null and now this 
---
im amazed how a single person brings people together like this 
---
Sounds better than everyone blobbing up in one region to me.
---
Made my day 
---
Oh nice, the CCP ass kissing posts are already starting.
---
&gt;It is literally business 101 to innovate or die.

Innovate lmao

Does anybody here use a Gaming Keypad for their hotkeys?  [Something like this one](https://www.amazon.com/RAZER-ORBWEAVER-CHROMA-Progammable-Adjustable/dp/B013P0HW7K/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1550318315&amp;sr=8-17&amp;keywords=game+keyboard)

If so, what model do you use and would you recommend?

I know you are not allowed to bind macros to them but I play on a laptop and the keyboard is not convenient due to the positioning.

FUCK THE NORTH
---
How? How could you possibly have nothing to spend it on? Sounds like to me you're the kind of player that sits around not doing anything but grinding and waiting for ops, then you complain you have nothing to do.
---
I played this game for 8 years, at no point did I ever have to much isk and nothing to do, I unsubbed with 55bil, came back and managed to spend 20 of it in only a month and a half.
---
Doing gods‚Äô work. Thanks for being amazing.

You are dumb.

Watch CCP add a zero instead.

Make it random, so it fucks also with input broadcasters
---
Quite true for the most part. Resistance to substantial change is so high in the vet Player base that if feels CCP does not have any idea how to move forward without creating a shitstorm  of some kind...  
---
However, improvement of the fundamental code base (one system on one node) and massive increase in the stability of the games technical infrastructure will definitely be appreciated but is costly and I guess money is the issue here
---

Sounds like a job for the balance te... oh. Right.
---
True but it did have Tidi for a while.
---
Good.  Fuck snuff. 
---
What?! Dude, I honestly fail to see how a Orca needs any kind of buff whatsoever... It's mining is in par with a Barge/Exhumer, it's EHP can reach freighter levels, It's BUFFs and logistical  support can actually make a ganker fleet fail on killing a member of the fleet (If you are not AFK mining with it, and actually keeping an eye in local and d-scan, making sure your Corp mates are save).
---
You make it sound like Tranquility is a giant snake eating its own tail.
---
We went to some pretty extreme lengths to get reship frigates so we could hold those capitals on the Arzad gate. Mad props also go to the Templis Basilisks that were keeping up our out of fleet armor tanked Punishers lol. It is worth pointing out that for us defenders in PIE/LUMEN/assrtd that this was the third defense fleet in about a week. The first time we formed we smashed a shoot first nightmare fleet on grid with the tower. The second DHSJ never came to reinforce(I believe they got caught by someone else?). 
---
snuff couldn't saved conoco this time lul
---
good to hear mate, yes I bought a house last year and everything changed for me.
---
That's a good point, thank you.

"I do it for free"
---
For just 100 plex you can get fast lane priority for 6 hours 
---
You put a lot of effort into this post and make quite a good argument but I mean firstly you've got to understand that /r/eve is not indicative of the entire EVE playerbase and is traditionally known for shitposts and spreading a specific narrative which is forgotten about in a week. This is similar to pretty much any subreddit, /r/gaming vs EA, /r/politics vs Trump, etc. Just look at the uproar over Reddit selling some stock to a Chinese company that lasted all of one weekend. The best place for constructive discussion of the game would probably be in an alliance forums or something similar because the EVE forums are the exact same and most people only use it to post on the Character Bazaar anyway.
---
With regards to your comments about bittervets, I've only been playing the game a litle over the year but I can see where people who have been playing for over a decade are coming from. EVE is really more of a hobby than a game and CCP making so many changes to the game is something people are upset about. They're worried that the game is going to be something completely different to what they signed up for in 2009. Even with skill injectors (realistically most normal people aren't going to spend upwards of ¬£2.8k to inject 200m SP via PLEX) most people have put years of training and effort in their characters and don't want to just unsub and quit playing like it doesn't mean anything.
---
So you're post makes some good points but I think it's kind of lost to expect anything good to come out of this subreddit tbh
---
the are finding innovative ways to die
---
You can pay for captcha solving services. The price is around 50 cents per 1000 captchas solved, no-brainer if you're running an RMT bot farm.
---
Innovating ways of throwing money into the trash can.
---
You forgot to add '(RMTer btw)' at the end.
---
Then Switch to a other Provider or create your own... isn't that hard
---
That was my point. My concern was injectors would change EVE from a game without SP grind to one with SP grind like other MMOs. 
---
Shut up nerd.
---
Siege Green is awesome. I don't know anything about them but i &lt;3 the logo. And puff -n- snuff sucks balls. 
---
They would just solve it too; IMHO the main problem is that the RMT market is worth more than CCP can afford to ‚Äúthrow‚Äù at it. 
---
Putting it simply, your group sounds shit.
---
What's the song? Need that on my pvp playlist
---
*Comspiracy:*
---
Hilmar ordered Skill **Extractors** into the game
---
\- EVE got better monetization, looks better for a new investor and really is good for himself financially
---
\- Firing every employee who dares to care for the customers.
---
\- PA might may have fallen for the bait, maybe the mobile game with EVE IP will be successful, maybe not
---
\- In the medium/long term the game is finally dead. Those big alliances will be the last peoples/bots playing - Goons startet to kill the game, they won!
---
Well, it was nice while it lasted
---
I've heard from a person that they need to cut all ties to any alliance and not play eve on that account for 7 months when they get a job at ccp.
---
No Idea if true or not
---
This subreddit seems to be full of people that really just need to take a break from the game, and this subreddit so we don't have to see their fucking whining.
---
Busy coding balance updates.
---
One of the main problems with Eve is that CCP has been catering the game to people like you and in the process pushing away the people who made Eve successful. Eve has a well know history of being a game that people never really quit, but just take breaks from, lately though less and less people have been returning because game has shifted to something very not recognizable as Eve. Skill injectors, mutaplasmids, instanced PvP and PvE, accesabltity and loss having no real meaning, have taken away from Eve being the harsh cold punishing universe that we have all learned to love.
---
 It's not that vets are against change but rather we don't want to see Eve get turned into another run of the mill garbage MMO that is already flooding the market.
---
WTF did they do to my UI again?
---
I had a distinct button for Ship Hangar and Intem Hangar in the left side Menu that i used since i started playing in 2007.
---
They seem to have been removed with no way to get them back. Even if i drag them from the crappy inventory to the side menu, they disapear once i close them (which was not the case previously).
---
Can i no longer make shortcuts to my sidemenu for specific hangars?
---
PS: Yes i know about the possibility to add them to the right hand station menu, but that is just as bad as the crappy general inventory.
---
I want them back in my Neocom to keep doing stuff they way i did for the past 12 years.
---
I cried :( 
---
Just make a sticky post where people can complain about the game dying so it doesn't clutter the entire sub.
---
i've been telling some ccp folks this since 2016
---
good luck
---
0h yeah, annoy all yet still not fix botters. Prime solution.
---
The same reasons plex prices started at 100 mil and now it's 1.9 bil to plex an account. Initially it was intended to help, but yeah now it's a cash cow. Just like skins, mcts, plex, etc. 
---
This would be the day I quit Eve.

No u
---
probably CCP 2015: "hey guys, lets devalue the most valuable resource (after salt) in our game and see what happens".
---
Alright. My nitpicks (Because of course I did)
---
* You spend the entire video at Max zoom
---
* The only editing is transitions, and a Tri-logo and slogan covering up what you deem to be Opsec.
---
* There are no difference in angles of shots or zoom at any point, not even in the warp tunnel.
---
* This is just music over standard fleet fight gameplay. Not nitpicking at the type of music, everyone has their tastes, but the music bears no relevance to the fight, it's just background.
---
**What do I expect from a fleet fight video?** Since fleet fights happen all the time, and follow very much the same path. Some **Context** would be amazing. **Why** are you fighting? Some kind of introduction would be nice. What ships are you using? Is this part of a war?
---
There is **no story** here to invest in.
---
Everything you've tried to explain to me would have been nice to have seen in video. Instead of that large Tri-Logo, maybe a description of the fleets next time so people know what the purple squares and red squares are. Since the only thing people know about is your module layout, and the only ship they ever get to 'see' are the minokowas that jump in later, since you don't zoom in. People who don't play eve, and want to get to know it better are going to be so in the dark. Videos like this are what attract people in! think of your potential audience :) 
---
You put the effort into recording the fights, lightly stringing them together and putting music and opsec videos over it. 5/10. I watched the whole way through, and it was interesting to see what Tri get up to nowadays because I really have no idea. 
---
Is that more fair? I wasn't intending to constructively criticise at the time, because I didn't have time time :)

Your move.

Please tell me you are just fucking clueless or pretending to be retarded...
---
Snuff members need to be castraded and gasses ( in game). 
---
The "50cents per 1000 captchas solved" you mentioned is only for the checkbox captcha.
---
It will fake with cookies and shit your identity as a bot, but as soon as it comes to a google captcha you are fucked.
---
This Problem is well known and came up first time in 2016. Googles put much effort in recaptcha to secure it against automated attacks. I don't say this will block 100% of the bots... but it will block a lot of them.
---
I think you forgot about googles picture captcha, it would need a very good software to analyse low res pictures and is able to detect even not complete parts of (for example) a street sign. [https://imgur.com/a/4FQqAID](https://imgur.com/a/4FQqAID)
---
You dont invest in oversaturated matkets idiot. FPS are horribly oversaturated and VR games dont have the potential to make it worth it. If they did am rts or 4x instead, then yes it would be easier to justify.

You're obviously looking at the wrong places.

...jump into lowsec, wait 10 min in novice fw site, see 3 garmurs, 5 worms and 6 comets on scan, warp off, logoff, uninstall
---
don't even joke about adding this
---
Sad
---
There are some resources listed on eve uni‚Äôs Website that show active camps (some website listed under 3rd party apps) and you could check it but it seems less hassle to do as suggested and change your warp in. I change my default to 100km (anything far off enough to ‚Äúlikely‚Äù miss a warp bubble) and see if anyone is there, then I warp out again and then to 0 @ the gate. But this has flaws. It‚Äôs worth it to hop to some unknown thing (moon is risky) and then try jumping to 0 from there 
---
Nevertheless I appreciate your effort. As you are not the only one who points out the nature of reddit discussion culture I may realize my fault here gradually. :-D
---
If only we still had ~~Net~~ EVE Neutrality.
---
STOP GIVING THEM IDEAS
---
...jump into lowsec, wait 10 min in novice fw site, see 3 garmurs, 5 worms and 6 comets on scan. Pull some range, fight, win or lose still fun.

b-b-but I was told by reddit plebs that snuff was undefeatable... I-I-I thought they were the killers of lowsec

Doesn‚Äôt seem like anything to me.
---
Very nice. I miss old EVE mission music. That very early 2000s synth laden drum and bass, if it even is that.
---
CCP maths\^TM
---
Sorry, I should have been more specific. A few of the captcha sites use real people to solve these. When Pok√©mon go bots were rampant they used the picture sites as well but they were still being solved within seconds. This isn‚Äôt a lossless battle, it‚Äôs worth the fight, captcha would kill the causal botters but anyone doing it as a hobby or investment might not be so deterred.
---
Cheers 
---
This makes me uncomfortably sad.
---
All signs of what is to come. RIP.
---
Hm. I think I can comprehend what you are trying to say with ‚ÄûPeople like me‚Äú. But generally I wouldn‚Äòt assume that new or more players are a main problem with Eve. Even if they are players like me ;-b
---
The worst is yet to come. In 2-3 years you gonna miss Eve that's today.   
---
IMO injectors ruined the depth of this game, everything else is just shitty balance and development.
---
Glad someone has the balls to stand up against the vocal minority and thank ccp for all their efforts in convincing convince us into being good Christians in life: go to church, raise a family and not spend countless hours playing in imaginary worlds sucking dry real life wallets. God bless CCP. It‚Äôs working. Time to follow the light.

wat?
---
Army of darkness could be interesting
---
New players are not the problem, hell we were all new players at some point, and having more people playing is good. CCP watering the game down in hopes of attracting new players is the problem.
---
Right in the feels... o7 &lt;sniffles&gt;
---
Ok I just logged in after being gone for years (a long time not even sure last time I played) wtf do I do? I got a skill going but who knows if it makes sense for me to train. What now? How do I get back in the swing and relearn the game? 
---
Burn jita took a weird turn this year
---
The only way you can change shit by now is full reset. The damage is done, any change into buffing or nerfing stuff will only solidify the top dogs position which will further advance the stagnation of the game. 
---
You realize that these things hurt the consumer more than anyone with bots, right?
---
very accurate, from video to heart...

If noone can make billions per hour, we would return to using rifters instead of titans. And it would be glorious.
---
You don't need any skills or qualities to pull newbies from rookie systems.
---
They don't want to solve it. The only way to solve botting is the same as drug enforcement in real life. You have to make it economically infeasible to bot. 
---
Right now 500 PLEX (or 1 old plex) is 1.7 billion, so about 11.7$ per bil, whereas a bil on the black market is 7 dollars.
---
If CCP makes the plex worth more, it will be better to just buy the isk from CCP thus eliminating botting completely.

Why don't you null peeps police yourselves?

Surely the big blocs can put aside their differences to engage in some serious evictions of the alliances which fail at the one simple task of not booting known rental botting corps - thats a start.
---
It's almost as if you allow this yourselves in sov null.

Or delete local and be done with it.
---
Eve community delivers every time
---
Fair point, that would be nice.
---
Who uses zkill for a br? 
---
I'd agree with a cap on what can be injected and certain skills being uninjectable. I think that'd solve most of the real problems people have with injectors.
---
Looks like a long term ambush plan to me.
---
Because daily injectors and stuff are really cool for impatient players. I'm tired of saying "you can definitely pvp with a new char" when in general low sp chars will have a 30% disadvantage, not counting implants that new players can't afford to play with.
---
Soon: "Surely I won't lose 68 in a row!"
---
Yeah which won‚Äôt happen. People that are still trapped in a purgatorial haze - waiting for ccp to suddenly come to their senses and make the semi-hard, definitely unforgiving, game they made for 12-13 years - should just quit. If anyone is bound to eve just for eve‚Äôs sake and is just waiting and hoping for the game to do anything other than enable the absolutely mediocre with huge amounts of safety and wealth then they should just give up and quit.

God dam allergies acting up again. 
---
I have to ask you, Did you actually watch the video? The text explained why we were fighting, who we were fighting, and where. 
---
The ship type is mentioned along with one of its weaknesses. 
---
Comms are bled in through the music to add some context to the text over the video. Like when the haws and Fax was called for. 
---
Spending the entire video at max zoom allows you to see what the two fleets are doing and what the grid looks like.  Im not sure a zoomed up full video of a bni would be as interesting as watching a fight unfold on a grid. 
---
 *"People who don't play eve, and want to get to know it better are going to be so in the dark. Videos like this are what attract people in! think of your potential audience :)"*
---
We dont make these videos in the attempt at recruiting newbros..Like if you want that, go look at Disowned Heroes Videos. 
---
On the music part, I dont think, other than maybe some Permaband, That any music would bear any relevance to anything in eve online.
---
It was a video of a fleet fight not a cinematic. 
---
Your Criticism is misplaced im afraid.
---
I've honestly hated reading this sub for the last few months because of the garbage that keeps being posted, Its been nothing but CCPls and FuckCCP threads for ages.. It gets exhausting to see 50 threads a day of the same shit, worded differently with a few shit ideas or opinions tossed in.
---
But I keep coming back, because there are still awesome videos and content that gets posted here if you sift through the trash long enough.
---
I hope this shark week proves to clean up the nonsense and return is to the days where content videos, propaganda and BR/AAR threads are the meat of this Sub.
---
I won't say thank you yet, because it can go either way, but I appreciate you stepping up to shovel out this shitshow. Godspeed.
---
What are the odds that, 3 hours after implementation, this would randomly pop up when you're in the middle of a fight?
---
Me to, but CCP officially started to focus on balance - and all what those modules need is just removing one zero from the capacitor usage stats. 
---
Haven't seen PVP Bots yet... Just make it pop up during PVE Mining / Scanning etc. 
---
For the love of all that is unholy please dont give them THAT idea.

&gt;but it's not longer pvp oriented nor it tries to be anymore.

Once upon a time, Brave was in Querious, Horde ended up there too. Every other bunch of Querious occupants since then have been pretending that just living there = QFC, which is hardly the case. 
---
Right, and if people want to multibox 30 T1 cruisers, I say go for it. If modifications like this slowed Rorq/cap proliferation, that would address the core of the problem, at least as so often stated.

To be honest, CCP didn't invest wisely. I can see why people are upset when CCP announces new developments, given they have a huge backlog of cancelled projects while issues in Eve remained seemingly unadressed.
---
CCP bought White Wolf publishing, which at the time of acquisition was the bigger company. CCP owned the pen and paper RPG World of Darkness and even a WoD MMO in development. However, after 8 years of brutal mismanagement and development hell it was unceremoniously axed. Given the popularity of the PnP, this actually would have been a good thing for CCP, if they didn't decide to drain personel from WoD to Eve where they were suddenly confronted with tasks outside of their own expertise.
---
Dust was on an entirely wrong platform, it should have been on PC and consoles for a wider audience. Instead it was on PS3 with the game itself being not a  selling point of the console. It was just another exclusive game. Instead of trying to salvage by porting they decided to flush years of development down the drain. Fortunately it also redeemed us from the presence of a very pesky community representative.
---
Then there's Nova. I have had a hard time seeing this work within Eve. It was some attempt to rehash on the Dust idea, but as a PvE game mostly...? Doesn't matter, this one has also been cut off. After CCP saw that developments lead into a dead end.
---
And then there are those VR endeavours Gunjack and Sparc, which are yet again ventures into a rather limited hardware market. Not even 1% of the gamers own a VR set, so why cater to such a limited market of people? As of now, VR games still are some gimmicky item.
---
Also there's Valkyrie... but nobody talks about Valkyrie... That's because, according to Steam stats, this game has had 1.6 players over the past 30 days, with a peak of 7 players.
---
And then there's Echoes. Where CCP partners with NetEase... ...yes, the same company Blizzard is partnering with to bring you the ~~wallet~~ family friendly Diablo Immortal. Trying hard to capitalise on the mobile market.
---
As of now, CCP is a one trick pony, having only one mass market product actually going for them. I can see that CCP wants to diversify, which is their fair right as a company if they want economic stability. But is it done by  mismanaging projects so brutally, that after almost a decade of development, it just gets sawed off? Is it done by releasing a multiplayer shooter on a platform where your release is basically a debut? Is it done by making games that could only be played by 1% of your potential audience? My answer is a short an simple "no".
---
TL;DR: World of Darkness MMO cancelled, Dust cancelled, several other developments cancelled, gimmicky VR games nobody plays, so much development time and funds wasted. Out of 8 products only 1 actually works.

What's the best trading hub for a Gallente-aligned character to sell? I've gotten killed too many times traveling to Jita. I even get killed by Caldari Navy (NPCs??).

I wonder if they ever made a change with multiboxing balancing in mind. Like don't let people inject stuff that require no attention..

Not a terrible idea

As it is right now its even a bad Joke.

Solid response, I apologise for my initial 4am grumpy self.
---
Still think some of my points hit home, and I wasn't saying that it should be a recruitment video for newbros. But understandable to everyone watching.
---
You asked me to expand further, and I did! I understand it's a "Fleet fight" not a "Cinematic" and I do have to disagree to some extent, if you're putting something to video that could be better explained and understood in an AAR, it's because it's more visually pleasing and appealing, so if you're making a video, there's gotta be some extent of camera work to one of the most beautiful games out there right now.
---
I watched it for a third time and I didn't see you mention what you were in. You were there to kill an astra timer, and you were fighting other Battle-cruisers! Sweet
---
Some of my critique may not have hit home but I don't think all of it was misplaced, we just have different opinions. I liked the video on first watch, I up-voted your post, I commented and interacted. The only take-away from this is that I'd do it differently :) 
---
Didn't say it was bad
---
Combat refitting 95% of the time was about balancing between tank/capacitor regen/damage. Specific tanking was an extremely niche thing anyway.
---
Could be but I think I lost it somewhere &gt;.&gt;

Yeah you bastards....you made us ALL cry.

You sure you didn't lose it to gross incompetence? A gang of ceptors doesn't just appear. They'd have been reported in Intel.

While multi boxing how do you keep track of this with 10+ clients?

Its a pretty old money making scheme,

1) create corp

2) fill it with new players

3) reap taxes
---
People get told to join a corp in eve and because the no nothing they get into one of these scam corps and quit the game because nothing happens.

spreadsheeting 5; make a spreadsheet list about all your potential target ships (miners, industrials, even freighters) and how many possible EHP you have to overcome to crack them open. If you're good in maths, your spreadsheet also gives you the number of ganknados you have to bring.

This is true. I was talking about their hurricanes, I didnt mean our own. That point is fair and sticks.

Do you agree that watching the ships pop on screen is better than reading a BR and AAR?
---
Also I dont mind constructive criticism, But I want it to be really well placed :D

I think it'd be hilarious if the image based captchas were like "click the Avatar" and then display insulting messages when they fuck up like "you've been living in null for 2 months and you don't know what an armor Titan looks like?"

Beware of hauling all your items to Jita to get a better price. There are numerous places along the route where your hauler can get hijacked (ganked). Especially if it's a T1 industrial with cargo expanders carrying more than 100m. Notably the Balle corridor and Uedama area.

I don't care too much for the AT, except for the highly enjoyable shittalk in between. What has me worried is trivial previous patch sidenotes like an activity tracker getting hourlong presentations at Vegas, or simply taking over larger player meets so you can forfeit your own Fanfest.
---
I lose :'(
---
This is what I do in pve. At the beginning, unless you are shooting sleepers, the rats will burn straight for you, so drop sentries and pop things burning right for you. Then once they get ang/trans up, scoop sentries and put out heavies.
---
Well the whole idea is quite simple here.          
---
We have one broken module that practically no one sane use - the only thing that need to be adjusted is capacitor usage -&gt; remove one zero.

You get module that starts to be worth to fit.

why do you think hes using bots

300+ people on killmail against a lowsec fw alliance .. really needs a redditpost
---
Yes, it was cargo expanders on a Nereus. I was following the route by immediately jumping via the yellow waypoints on the Overview (I don't use autopilot).
---
I think my mistake was trying to backtrack during my route. I noticed something interesting earlier in my route, and I tried to get there somewhat manually. I think what happened is that rather than warping to the gate, my ship started moving there in slowboat mode (because it was too close for warp?) And that probably pulled me out of cloak.
---
meanwhile bloodraiders only have two skins.
---
just make vnis omega 
---
Good job feeding more. 
---
&gt; If anything it was the opposite, skill injectors allowed people to completely bypass grind and **trivially spin off capital pilots**.
---
Do not you realise the advice given to newbies who're over that initial that ~3 month of skills by every null group is "hey go grind some injectors with your VNI and then you can get into caps and make even more"?
---
You're straw manning. Just because only a handful of people get AT special edition ships doesn't mean only a handful of people care about the AT.
---
what happened to CZ?

Nothing better then seeing snuff eat shit in low sec. However, I feel your br may have a mistake in it, it says sakey undocked.

Why not getting a module that ‚Äúturns off‚Äù local for five minutes while the ship is there (with a restart timer)?

Cause Avarage-Joe-Player looks at changes judging what they d do to him alone and isolated, not thinking about what it does to everyone else and the game in general.

Translation at the end?
---
&gt; every time they do one of their few and far between balance patches 
---
And that's the problem.
---
Capital balance? Limited changes, spread way out. Rorq issues? Limited changes, none recently. Citadel fights? Limited changes, none recently (if anything, buffs via flex structures). Sov benefits/anom issues/etc? Limited changes, way spread out. And those are the things that get bitched about. 
---
Compare that to, say, AF/HAC changes? They went a really long-ass time untouched. But then they gave them a nice new module and tweaked stats. Then they followed up and tweaked stats a bit more. And those ships are great, fun to fly, seeing a lot of use in a variety of settings without being OP, and people are loving it.
---
CCP doesn't need to do a carrier-fighter-level rework to make supercaps less oppressive. They don't need to completely redesign all the underused navy hulls to spice things up a little. They don't need to completely rework the entire citadel system in order to make citadel fights more interesting. But instead of doing little number tweaks once a month and keeping an eye on things, they do ... whatever it is they've been doing.
---
&gt; AT is arguably the end game of EVE is several forms.
---
Instanced PVP is the end game of EVE?  what?  Instanced PVP is the exact opposite of what EVE strives to be.  AT is a simple exhibition that has very little impact on the eve universe other than an injection of expensive ships for collectors to pine over.

---
"i delivered it dude, check you delivery hangars in [station]" 
---
That would have done it. And slowboating the 12km back to the gate you just jumped through might even have looked like autopiloting. Cargo expanders are a bad idea for long distance traveling; you end up sacrificing so much tank to get that extra capacity that anybody can gank you without much effort. Sell your bulky stuff locally so you can haul the high value stuff with max tank.
---
Don't need them anymore. Theres an open source solver w/ 85+% accuracy which google said they won't counter. (even though they did do some fixes a couple weeks ago, it still works well)

https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha
---
To your question: No. You will have to test this yourself. A good place to go is the test server because someone will buy the expensive implants and skill hard-wiring (spoiler its impossible to be completely un-scannable)  the only thing you will find is at what sensor strength with combats you are able to be scanned down at. 
---
Probe-ability is a function of signature radius divided by sensor strength. They made a change a few years ago where this formula cant get much bigger than 1 (I think, I know for sure it starts to cap off.) Not sure about a cruiser, but if i were you id go for armor (or shield with no buffer and no shield rigs) with the sebos with eccm. If youre watching dscan like a good player then as soon as you see any combat probes you'll know you are being chased. If you are going into hostile nullsec, some people are so rich there that they have dedicated accounts with perfect scanning and virtues. Also the more people do this cloaky nullified ECCM cancer, the more people will keep a dedicated scanning account/pod.
---
Yeah, the statement is you're retarded and just have CCP a bunch of money to extract your characters. 
---
oh yea i was looking at Flex hardeners recently and went "why the fuck would anyone use this" 
---
and sure thing, there are 0 ships on zkill that died w/ them fitted 
---
It has been supers v cruisers for years.  People are deluding themselves into thinking that it was great back in the day.  
---
Also, how are people comparing the AT to roams?  as you said the AT is not running.  Roams are 98% running, 2% ganking, neither of which have anything to do with the instanced pvp that the AT is.

COMBATREFITTING! (SRSLY CCP WTF)

*sniff*
---
The farm runs 24/7.
---
It's irrelevant that it takes more (even though it probably wouldn't), they have all the time in the world, I don't.
---
It wouldn't prevent anything it would only piss off people that have better things to do than to pick traffic lights for a ML algorithm. 
---
tbh that wasnt true most of the time.
---
I wonder if they cancelled the AT partially because a russian team won it and the whole anti-russian mood in the world these days?
---
Idk when the two largest alliances in the game team up and then complain about the lag they produce... just being within 3 jumps of goon fleets causes tidi 
---
*shivers in joy* oh it was. nothing say "this fight is over" like a PL cyno lighting on grid and the full fucking hammer dropping on your little cap brawl, oh fuck yes :D
---
undocking a cap met fear of loosing it.
---
If you knew what the shit you are talking about you'd know that the way it works is by analyzing your cookies and history for suspicious activity and if it detects such thing you get a [normal captcha](https://imgur.com/a/pF4FJEU)

It would be funny if I wasn't learning ML myself and HAVE to know how captchas work, a solver for these things was the very first project I did on image recognition.

But since I am, it's just sad.

I have been subbed since Eve was released.

After the injectors were introduced i canceled my subscription.

This is the only solution. It might sting, but it's the only solution

No shit sherlock, but you are missing the point

Ok, I assumed it was just the button push since that's all it gave me on my phone, but if it's the full one then no go. Might I suggest we don't have to use the Google one. Could build in a standard capcha and even build a lore around Concord wanting a capsuleer help desiphering a code.

The game clearly already knows when you attack an NPC vs a player. If you've been shooting NPCs for 2 hours straight then you get it. Don't see how this would be an issue once every couple hours.
---
Farm isk and plex account. Alot of ppl do that 
---
Yes you can anchor in npc null, but it would be subject to the whims of anyone who wants to destroy it.  You can also base your mission running out of the npc ORE stations. Also know that every hostile in the area knows your farming excavator bpcs and that is a juicy target.  
---
F 
---
Yeah that's gay no everyone got to whore on the mail!
---
But they do have RTS already. It's called "EVE Online".
---
If CCP makes plex worth more, RMT's will lower the price of a bil. They can afford to lower it many times over and still be worth doing.
---
People live in the Wildlands?
---
Why a sotiyo? You cant build supers in npc null.

oh sorry badly worded post

i meant that roxxenis really good at making people hate him and that brings people together to fuck with him

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

Where the fuck is this service and how do I sign up for it. I fucking hate captchas and they tell me I'm a bot half the time when I'm supposed to click all the traffic lights or some bullshit. How does a bot actually solve those better than a human can that's legitimately fucked
---
Hey nice br looks like a fun time
---
they dont they just click the checkbox and/or delete cookies or some shit to reset your "free" checkbox counter before you have to solve pictures afaik 
---
its bad. Scripts for solving Captchas are not new. So either game needs very annoyng ones or pointless ones.
---
look at jDownloader
---
I wonder what's the % of players in highsec comparing to null these days. It used to be 80% in highsec....
---
Captcha is actually pretty easy. You just need to click and then immediately move your mouse. 
---
I've implemented Google Recaptcha multiple times. You don't get to pick. They decide how to deliver captcha. It's not a simple checkbox all the time. It's "find the fore hydrants" or "find the crosswalks". Sometimes they can be pretty damn hard as a human and are definitely annoying as hell when you have to actually solve them. You're helping train computer vision algorithms and they are starting to get really good. Google also has the power to change up the type of captcha any time they want.
---
People live in all the npc null regions, even Stain!
---
Because I could only fly t1 stuff.
---
I made a lot of isk really fast when I first started and bought an incursion toon so I just did incursions all day because they were fun for me.
---
Ended up buying two more characters before injectors were a thing, but otherwise I had no progression of my account.

I could only fly the hulls, not the weapon systems. And I didn't want to waste a week or two of training because I was aiming for logi 5 and cruiser 5.

LMFAO the top results are you paying *HUMANS* to solve the CAPTCHAs. Y'all are killing me
---
That is it, some in-game check if whether your human at some interval to get bounties/minerals!  Problem solved.  When CCP?

Wait, what? You can't build supers in npc null? Why?
---
for stageing ground a astrahus, Athanor or a raitaru would be much cheaper and with that less intresting  to destroy.
---
&gt; If anything, we should thank CCP for allowing us, the players, to have basically free run of their internet space playground
---
Until recently it was not free, and the free to play mechanic is highly limiting. 
---
I have seen it first hand, it's bad. I was a member of a Corp that just joined them and we consisted of about 80% &lt;1month old accounts of which more than half had to be legit newbros. Enjoying running missions with their new friends, do mining fleets, get them interested in the game and all. Then all of a sudden leadership wants the whole thing to move to null and join theran to "conquer our own space and establish an alliance with someone that will protect us while we earn very big amounts of money in null." aka slave away as renters :)) 
---
you need to upgrade the system. 
---
nice one!
---
If you have implementet it already you know, the Picture Captcha only shows up in fishy situations, like you already tried 5 times to enter a password, using a server os, a fishy ip-adress etc. it also works with cookies and meta datas.
---
But still 90% of the time, only the checkbox shows up if you are a normal user.
---
Of course you are paying humans. But as far as you're concerned it's a paid API that you use to get captcha solutions.
---
&gt; It was met with "Fuck you noob we're not gonna listen to you"
---
Dude I've been in quite a lot of groups, never ever this happened to me. At worst I was promised to be trained yet that never happened (and frankly, it's a computer game so it's understandable)
---
&gt; Because god forbid if the status quo is upset and NEW STUFF and NEW PEOPLE happen. God. The horrors would be indescribable.
---
Which is why groups like Brave Newbies, Karmafleet, Pandemic Horde etc have no chance to survive at all. Oh wait.
---
&gt; you have any idea of the impact your usual "recruitment" has on people?
---
There is no API anymore. However, yes, I know what the impact is, I was a recruiter for a group without API checks and we got murdered precisely because of it. Additionally, a lot of people later approached me and said that API check was the moment when they realised EVE is a real shit - and they liked it precisely for that!
---
Anyway, your group is shit, move to some friendlier group.
---
Yes I am missing the point.
---
People who run bot farms are completely unaffected and people who don't have to solve captchas.
---
TOTALLY MISSING THE POINT
---
We had our first practice, people were excited and hopeful for this year. CCP basically shot our team straight through the heart. Now it's just sadness and people unsubbing their accounts in chat. Super depressing. 
---
Mum mum
---
1. ask for the reCAPTCHA audio challenge
---
2. use the Google speech-to-text service to solve the audio challenge
---
3. enter answer
---
Oh in part for sure, I was playing for less than a year and much less familiar with the game. 
---
In part it was a lack of Intel (I was in CO2 and we didn't have the Intel we have today with the tools we have today, with all the people in every system you have in Delve), in part they were really fast and immediately warp to me almost at zero. 
---
It was a lesson, trust no one ;) 
---
&gt; established players are more important than new players. It's us who build alliances, run fleets, and create content. 
---
No. Active players, enterpreneurs of EVE are more important than passive hordes mining in Delve (or elsewhere). The game age of someone doesn't matter. 2-3 months old FC is more important than 12 years old mission runner in highsec.
---
If a new blood doesn't step up, maybe they're too intimidated. Maybe you're doing something wrong. Because when you look at the nullsec, yes those fugly empires of mindless slaves, you'd see that there are new FCs popping up quite regularly.
---
Only ones that suck probably, I never saw something this retarded before.
---
With him and people like him, the game dies. You can then dance in an empty space.
---
&gt; Scripts for solving Captchas are not new
---
The image recognition ones outsource to actual people who spend their day sitting there solving captcha for pennies. 
---
It made me go through 4 retarded image recognition tests, 0 chance I'll ever do this in a game.
---
Karma Fleet, Dreddit, or whatever the newbro corp is in PH
---
How exactly do you tell the difference between a bot and a turbo autist player in a game that has no browser in it?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ahejku/ccp_i_found_a_fix_to_botting_it_is_so_obvious_it/
---
Too late to join in on asking?
---
/u/Tikktokk is right in his first two sentences. In the phrase "adapt or die", death is one of the valid choices. But then he goes off on a tangent and he doesn't take his original premise far enough.
---
&gt; Be honest to yourself you grumpy bastards: You know that you love this game so much.
---
This sentence is missing one letter: the letter "d" at the end of "love". We *loved* this game so much, past tense. On my blog, I defined the word "bittervet" as "someone who has had the things they love about EVE destroyed to the degree that there's no point in doing them." A bittervet is what some players become at the end of a love affair with EVE. That doesn't mean we hate the game. It's actually something worse: disappointment, followed by apathy.
---
All of us have our *specific* [reasons for quitting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/aqvsvr/why_are_people_suddenly_extracting_their_toons/egkie5g/?context=0) the game, but in the most wide, general sense, people quit playing games because the things they loved about the game aren't fun to them any more, and any new features introduced to the game are also not fun to them. I also loved Bioshock for a while, but I don't play it any more. I've never played World of Warcraft because I don't see anything in it that would be fun for me.
---
Which comes back to "adapt or die". You say we need to adapt, or we're hypocrites. Sure, I can buy that. But I am adapting: I am adapting to new games that I am playing instead of EVE Online. That is also a valid choice.
---
lol didn't see that.. but who delteted it?
---
Still does bot checking well 
---
For someone who knows fuck all about highsec, how can they shoot his MTU and not get Concorded? 
---
r/eve has finally jumped the shark
---
Make the Wildlands Great again. 
---
Eve advertising is getting smarter 
---
its deleted? Its older for sure, didnt realize it got deleted.
---
/u/jibrish is it deleteD?
---
We live in the low sec pocket connected to it in metropolis. 
---
Not sure if you are aware but an ocr can over come that quite easily. 
---
Remember the mod strike? Last a few days and they started scabbing. 
---
Mod team here I just like CCP, all talk and no follow through.
---
something like company of heroes or starcraft, they have the lore and the models from dust already so. 
---
I think if the last couple years have taught me anything, it's that you should never listen to the old whiny fuckers who hate change.  They are a force for stagnation and ossification in the world, and should be summarily dismissed.
---
If you look at their Zkill, you see alot of them getting killed by Theran members.
---
Installed, online iHub upgrade
---
I‚Äôd train into oracles and take them into WHs for some citadel bashing. Or maybe a few smartbombing BSs for some lowsec grief. 
---
Tornados, camping jita 4-4 etc all p saturated, boring, and you mostly just catch really dumb people. Also wreck looting bots are a thing now. Wonder how many nados to gank a mission runner...
---
I'm always a sucker for needing more toon, ships and sp. As someone who streams Eve content and helps the new Bros. If something that would interest you pm me and we can talk there's do many options to cover as far as what you can do.
---
I mean at this point I've done some pretty stupid shit with some fairly blingy ships that then exploded so undocking anything gives me fear of loss
---
Problem with eve is that a ton of hotkeys can be used whereass in osrs most things need to be done by mouse input.
---
I would like to see ccp come up with a system to detect software generated input though (which does exist in osrs). That‚Äôd solve so much botting problems tbh.
---
Weird how you're always in the centre of some shitty problems with mods, censorship, banning etc.
---
I guess it's fair game.   You get flagged suspect.
---
Not true at ALL lmao wow. So dumb of you to say that.
---
Could you add a comma for the ore unit amounts? Would be easier to read when you start getting into the 100 thousands+
---
Ah ok, ta. 
---
Fuck no
---
Ccplease give jagex a call for some tips and tricks. 
---
As far as I remember CCP once said they‚Äôre good friends with Jagex. They should indeed ask for help or something.
---
If they are then they should totally ask for help. It is badly needed... Or maybe we could all ask jagex to offer assistance that is sorely needed. 
---
Certain null blobs have proven more willing to kick people who report bots than actually boot the botters. Cause spaceships be srs bsns or something.
---
So what happens when they figure out the time threshold and one tap another bot vessel to avoid triggering this "pve mode" every so often
---
Uh was that supposed to help your case? It doesnt. Lmao.
---
Can you imagine hoping through a gate, seeing a gang, trying to plan your escape around your close timer, aaaaand you die because that image is super fucking grainy so you couldn't tell that it had a bus in it.
---
also an easy way to get me to go and play something that doesn't constantly require me to click in the middle of the screen on every action.
---
Jibrish must be sleeping.
---
Almost like he is pantsufan
---
&gt; Weird flex, but ok
---
 - CCP, probably
---
Dark assessment.  
---
I want to discount this as just more reddit unhappiness,  but sadly as time ticks away this view starts to look more and more correct.  
---
It is a narrow bridge to walk running a lean efficient company that is trying to not leave money on the table, while at the same time delivering a production that still seems fresh and fun to play.  
---
The pull back from a large forward facing community team is a good example.  It‚Äôs kind of hard to quantify how teams like that add to profits, even if they add lots of more intangible value to the game.  Perfect place to cut. 
---
Same goes for AT...it adds value, but actually to a pretty small number of people. Good thing to cut. 
---
If you are just looking at a balance sheet, these are pretty easy decisions. Sadly, bit by bit they kind of eat away at the sense of ‚Äòfun‚Äô you get from playing Eve. 
---
CCP always seems like they have been running darn lean from a game development point of view, so it‚Äôs actually hard for me to tell if they are any slower recently....but maybe that‚Äôs just me. 
---
In the end, we will have to see if what direction PA/CCP wants to go.  Sadly, if you look to gaming companies as a whole, spending real money to add intangible value to a community/game is not high on the list.  
---
Your group(s) was/were ass. I started FCing in late 2016 and found no issues rising up the ranks and eventually fitting in with "bittervets". 
---
I won eve like 3 years ago. I log in in alpha state now and then, then log out about 15 minutes later. 
---
This is probably the final nail in the coffin of ever attempting again.
---
What concerns me is not the cancellation, per se. It's that AT has been a staple for eve for such a long time and relatively little work goes into running it.
---
If ccp is willing to cut this low effort corner stone of the eve experience, what else are they going to do?
---
This game is just not worth putting effort into with the direction its heading.
---
Thank you. Yes, a lot of us have preached adapt or die for years, but at some point we looked at EVE, and CCP, and realized that the best adapting we could do was just to save what time we had for games and developers that seemingly give two shits about their core gameplay model.
---
Hi, we are aware and are monitoring. It seems like an unrelated DB performance problem is slowing down the market for The Forge.
---
Dude, my rig that uses 0.7kW can run 4 eve clients at max settings no problem. I am in no way optimized for botting. 
---
I would suspect a client on low settings plus botting program would take at most 0.1kw, if even that. Lets say your rig does 5 clients at a time with the bot program running and using your numbers, to generate 1 billion takes 30 cents to generate 1 bil....
---
I'm sure someone who knowns what they are doing with good access to used hardware can cut that price in a third if not more. 
---
Yep. Absolutely obscene how many bots are running out there these days. But you know what really bugs me?
---
The "everything is fine, we banned x number of bots this month" posts from CCP
---
That would have been progress in 2014. In Injectors Online 2019, those same botters are back in action within 48 hours under new accounts...
---
Shit's fucked
---
Easy? No
---
Thanks for the update
---
Hed Kandir: "Can I not watch this shit next time? It's was so fucked up..."
---
It was right after the first match vs NC. when we could not kill anything except stray vedmak and almost lost Otto - http://i.imgur.com/j8z8QL9.jpg. Hed was listening on comms and watching official stream.

Well I tried to throw ccp a bone. Seems they cant balance skins either :(

---
how can all of you be this retarded lol
---
I like how I basically give blatant intel that we gate camp and in which system we do it, but yet the butt hurt is still on overdrive for you. Come push our shit in instead of QQing on reddit that we're not elite.
---
because you are just meatshields/pets
---
I knocked out 10-15 galas on the first two days. Lost about 100m. Not to mention that you can only mine enough event ore to get 2 tricarb per site, but turn in requires 5. Lets not even talk about the broken booster material requirements this time around. I haven‚Äôt, nor will I be warping back to any again this time. Here‚Äôs hoping things go back towards how they were. 
---
Or just make mining an interactive activity. Ya know, like a video game. 
---
or they are so good, nobody dies if they have it on. 
---
Join goons. You will be much happier and richer.
---
My first c5 ratting moros. Spend 2 weeks flying it in. Lost it in 2 hours by a gang led by the very guy I watched tutorials from on how to do sites in it. Glorious loss. What made it even better was that I was in WiNGSPAN by the time which made it even weirder that I flew a moros.
---
Start awoxing. Don't be a pet. Rise! Free Yourself!
---
Anyone have the link to the ecm video?
---
Thank spod.
---
You see, everything you mention comes down to one thing - trust. I don't know how good or bad a group you were part of was in terms of trust and providing useful feedback info, it doesn't sound too good, but without people trusting you you won't get to have access to anything that could ruin the fun for the group - exactly because of that, because ruining the fun and trust inside corp/alliance is the most reliable way to make said group collapse.
---
Steep recruitment is there mainly so both linemembers and leadership can be assured that amount of people you can't trust or people that could cause some problems (even unknowingly, by just not being good cultural fit for the group) are reduced to manageable minimum. It's basically to stop blatant trolling, and it's a practice from days long gone when open recruitment groups were common targets for this kind of trolls. Even with recruit trolls being very small fraction of playerbase they could go from corp to corp, joining, causing havoc and then leaving. Also, my general impression is that the more demanding and complicated recruitment process is, the more trusted you are as linemember after you join - if someone spends time and effort to write good recruitment thread, provides all APIs and answer all questions without raising any doubts, this is a lot of effort and this means that person seems quite certain they want to join in and fly with us. Even groups that recruit everyone as they go (like Horde) usually have this kind of trust proof gating somewhere later on, be it joining capital group, being given access to certain tools/resources etc. Potential damage a single malicious person can cause in EVE is huge, therefore recruitment evolved over time to accomodate for that - making it significant effort required to gain access to anything that could cause a disaster.
---
As for FCing - I don't believe anyone can be appointed to FC, without full support from the group you're FCing for you won't achieve anything. As FC you need fleetmembers to want to fly with you and want to follow your commands, and to be entrusted with any strategic objectives leadership needs to believe you'll be able to deliver on the task. In any successful corp leadership isn't dumb, they see what's being talked about, how people talk about each other and what happened - and if there's a case when linemembers in general might've wanted to not fly with certain person as FC, that person isn't going to get an approval even if they were the most skilled and knowledgable pilot in entire game.
---
Nobody reasonable will ever turn away promising FC material people want to fly with and follow his commands, ever. In big organized groups you'll have to spend some time running roams and small fleets to be more recognizable and show you'll be able to deal with pressure and deliver on expectations from strategic fleets; in smaller groups usually everyone can form a fleet and get stuff going - but they can't in any way force people to join the fleet. I didn't FC much over last 3 years I play with others (I don't believe I'm good FC material), but the moment showing me that I was doing at least something right when FCing was christmas break of 2016, when - with 5 people in comms and a ping out - I've got in 3 minutes 15 carriers + small subcap fleet ready to go (from about 100-man nullsec alliance), no SRP, no hull reimbursement, no support available whatsoever, against Inner Hell to save tackle Rorqual - so if anything went wrong it would be a disaster. Noone appointed me to FC, nobody even allowed me to risk about fourth of our back then capital fleet, people just went with what I asked them to do on their own. Including some people who'd log out the moment an FC they didn't like flying with for whatever reason pinged - regardless if it was just a roam or strategic objective.
---
unless they learn that the stickies are informative and good instead of stupid garbage? 
---
&gt; Ok fine, I wasn't flying around in a Thanatos, boo bloody hoo. 
---
This is the attitude I think people are missing. Where did anyone get this sense of entitlement that "I'm a paying customer so I should be just as good as any other paying customer"? No. The pilot next to you is flying a bigger ship because he joined the game 5 years before you. That's how MMOs have always worked. There's a progression, there are levels you have to go through so you feel like you've accomplished something when you get those blingy weapons. When you're a new player grinding your way up, and you catch a glimpse of a very high-level player sporting whatever the big weapons/armor/etc. are, you should be standing in awe and wondering how long it takes to get that. If it was years, *so what*? MMOs have to remain playable for a long time, it *should* take years (decades?) to be able to play all the content.

i did about 70 gala tickets (5 ore +13m isk), I made a bill off the first 10 and then it went down hill, I broke even by 70, I got allot of shit capital skins lol

do 10 then go play something else 
---
the 20+ overseeing and the high grade EROS plug in kept me going till i saw less of them

to buy every thing for a drop box is 23.8m so when I saw 238 bill spike to 722m from 10 boxes I was going to do this all day lol

but nooooooo

Maybe, he is just forgetful?
---
.... you have no idea don't you?          
---
Because they roam Eso as well? Stop being a whiny bitch and kill them.
---
hey guess what else gives you random loot?
---
npcs
---
all the 'lootboxes' are are npc drops that are easier to trade on the market.
---
instead of rng roll happening when the npc dies, it happens when you open the box.
---
With difficulty.
---
Goons roam eso daily, hell hourly on weekends.  Not sure what your smokin brah.
---
Wait, since when we don't roam Esoteria anymore?
---
Send in your resume to CCP!
---
that's just the current TQ iterattion, i can remember clearly when you could 5 v 30 and hold the grid
---
Why should we? It's not our job to fix the botting problem in eve. 
---
That would double my necessary inputs probably while running 50 VNI... Would still be nice ism for the effort

not all pvp is equal, i know is controvertial and it's ok, have fun, but what i said is basicly: If you strive for greatness in pvp ccp doesn't want you to.

---
Yeah. Back a few weeks ago, joe was in a fleet we popped, he SD'd then too. Their is a standing order to primary him first now.
---
Far larger companies than CCP have been trying for far longer to create a better method for bot recognition. It‚Äôs a really tough problem to solve, since between bots getting better and cheap labor, captchas are in a constant arms race.
---
they said we'd get shield slaves
---
but you don't get a constant stream of faction npcs.
---
It‚Äôs tough to detect bots given the tools available. There are some methods that work, but if the botter is smart they‚Äôll be able to avoid those and act like a human. We have a lot less information than CCP does. I tend to whackamole bots when I find them, but I can 100% guarantee you there are others that fly under the radar.
---
That being said, if you do know of any bots in Test, let me know so I can kebab them. I always appreciate any bot reports, since more leads makes it easier to find them.
---
Kind of, except they can make a living out of it where they live.

You need to learn what the medical classification of "disease" is.
---
Set up a chill gatecamping, kill rats every time so your tackle doesn't get hazed, get captcha pop up the moment hostile gang jumps in. If it got ever introduced, I'd give it at most a week until we see this kind of story.
---
Is that a popular mission area?  People will purposefully scan down MTUs just dropped and attack them, hoping to get these 1b BS to aggress and get a limited engagement.
---
I get the stupid picture things constantly, certainly not only 10% of the time. It is more likely that I need to do pictures than not.
---
helloooo handsome!
---
flair bait, nice
---
Well all you gotta do is invent a gamemode that can't be botted and make that gamemode give tons of isk...
---
Test is evicting frat and the russians get the space?

I had a feud in the past over ESS.  Ended up with like 20 dead to the same guy.  he lost a handful of VNIs killing them (triggered rat anom), isk was about neutral.

There‚Äôs still an API, ESI is the latest version.

Hey thanks for continuing to bring all those punishers in.  Was alot of fun, and challenging, to try and keep them up with basis, and you in a different fleet.

but yeah, come to J-Space, it's better here

Do you have a doctorate of Medicine?

Because people who do have classified addiction as a disease.

Theres even a genetic factor in alcohol addiction.

So yeh, you are an idiot. Stop thinking you aren't

There was a trailer put out during Fanfest 2014 called [EVE Online: The Prophecy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFTUazuGdTw). This was back when Dust was still going and when Valkyrie was on the horizon, I think, and showed promise. 
---
This trailer is meant to show a couple things. 
---
One, the three games (EVE, Dust, Valk) all working together and hopefully leading one day to a unification of the games. Cause remember at that time they were tying Dust in to EVE. 
---
Two, that big ass thing is a capsuleer(player) built stargate. But not just any. It is MASSIVE and it's implied it might be able to go somewhere that we currently cannot. And such, the empires are trying to stop us. Because such tech would make us too powerful. So the fight there is Capsuleers(players) versus the Amarrian Empire.
---
This is good news if true. 
---
Does it have something to do with the 18% tidi in perimeter?

what bullshit alliance blacklists for afk?
---
Nah, just from my memory they fought together back in 2012/13 to evict solar.

True.

Then keep AFK, and whola, you've beaten the game

You seem upset.

Probably some "elite" we be PvPing alliance

Just remove sovnull local or make it into a sov structure where one is needed in each constellation

yoooooooooooooo doooooooooooooooooooooooooooodes

speach start at 16 minutes

Sounds like a shit alliance. Your better off not going back there
---
I have a better idea. Let's just burn down CCP headquarters and start a campaign to destroy every last bit of EVE Online data on any electronic storage the world over.  
---
Let's make it like EVE Online never even existed. That idea is orders of magnitude better than yours.
---
The amount of stupidity you display in one sentence is amazing.
---
yup thats exactly why
---
For some perspective the people writing this stuff are at war with Theran so there is some bias there.
---
The trick is to pick grids that contain a large part of the traffic light. Something like the backplate of the light has, in my experience, flagged me as a bot more times than I can imagine
---
the sotiyo isn't for npc space but everywhere else since the massive hunt for them in highsec
---
Kree! 
---
Why mods removed it? Lol

You never mention your IGN. What is it so I can snoop these fits? üòÖ

I meant it more as a general question, like I have a hisec trading alt that randomly got invited to a corp, and I don't think that corp is a scam corp, just one run by noobs. It's kind of cute, honestly.

Gambling addiction is classified a disease [WHO in the ICD-10](https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en#/F63.0) and also in the DSM-V, for the latter I can't provide a link because it's not public unfortunately. Additionally you can find gambling addiciton in every textbook of pschiatry and psychology.
---
yep thats me
---
That is really nifty.
---
That doesn't look like MN in that picture.  If you are in SoCal, I'll buy you a beer.
---
except normal ratters dock up when local disappears hmmmm
---
Fighting NPCs to get random ticket drops you can, with other items, exchange for a loot box that has a bad RNG mechanic for loot inside is very different from ratting for ISK or killing faction spawns for drops.
---
Cool.
---
Then you should have joined years ago. It was a subcap null.

I love how entitled you feel. Its a fucking joke. Content creators happen not because they vets but because someone said i am going to do something fun  who is coming with me? Content will happen today and after you fuck off. So jump off that high horse and take a long fucking look at yourself in the mirror. You not special. No one gives a fuck about your entitlement. Eve will go on and i will have fun without you bitching in my ear.
---
That‚Äôs where Intel channels come in. You get one VNI and the whole damn constellation docks. The fact you can go from site to site in the same system, killing the same 3 bots over and over and over proves its bots.... no ones that stupid  
---
Could you pm me link? Would like to listen please. Thanks
---
And it was years ago. I guess the whole point of his topic is to create a space somewhere in the New Eden cluster, trying to recreate the subcapital battles of olde. Only problem here, is that we're missing quite a critical ressource to allow this.
---
Players.
---
Maybe this can be one of PA effect.
---
Korean online games have lots of Lootbox stuff. It is already well proved mechanic to milk gamers.
---
Lootbox causes more addiction. That‚Äôs because you can spam it.
---
For example, You must spend some time to find and kill Faction NPCs so there is hard cap at there.
---
But opening lootbox doesn‚Äôt have that kind of cap. All you must have is enough isk, so you can spam it enough to get addict.
---
Addict is not always bad. But I‚Äôm being addict on online game is bad for 99% of gamers. In Korea, It became serious problem so now all game companies must open their lootbox table and it‚Äôs chance to public by law.
---
Remember, Lootboxes are NEVER good for gamers. It‚Äôs only for milk you and us.
---
this actually can be interesting FRT is clearly against "goons" and pro "PH" ^(you could say NCPL like a year ago)        
---
Maybe goons will decide to help RA a bit - pushing FRT into drone lands.

---
Hey, I resent that.
---
isnt this just more content for skillyouareself
---
Was thinking of this the other day in response to some other posts. I think it would provide an interesting variation in gameplay to completely block capitals (except maybe jump freighters) from a particular region. 
---
I was also (in my head) toying around with the idea of rechargable stargates that had a mass limit similar to wormholes, after which they would need to recharge, or be recharged (remote energy links?) before more ships could pass through them. I thought something in the region of say 15 to 20 battleships might be a reasonable number. Plenty enough to allow extensive roaming with cruisers and battlecruisers. 
---
that moment PH is the name people call Panfam instead of NCPL.
---
does this mean we've become the dominant power in the coalition xD
---
Good idea, but please no Google captcha :(
---
in short, yes
---
Obviously in Eve they would not be the same as the website ones, but rather made into a less nonsensical Eve style, and also they might or might not use the same mechanics as the website ones. Perhaps no cookies, or anything like that, might even have their own very small exec that would need to be downloaded and executed from within the game each and every time.
---
This would disable any of the standard web captcha bypassing methods from the ground up and by default. They could definetly be implimented on mission agents such as the ones that give out hauling missions, there would be no danger to real players as they would be executed while docked up at an agent station and would have no effect on PvP response times.
---
Sure there are methods for visual recognition, but there are also already methods to thwart that as well and they are effective, just google it and see. 
---
Next, make it so Eve can be run from within an actual OS, not a VM and make 2FA mandatory for every logon that does not use a verifiable IP (such as VPNs, proxies, etc.). I'm not an IT expert, but there has to be a way for the Eve client to be able to tell if its being ran from a VM instead of an actual OS installation. 
---
Its a never ending back and forth fight, but I think combined these type of things could put a pretty big dent in botting and overall automation of the game.
---
In addition, there are some game features that need to be changed as well such as: Option to auto target back the attacker, auto targeting computers, auto missiles, auto drone auto agro. These need to be changed or in some cases just removed completely.
---
Unfortunately, none of these types of things will ever be implimented as limiting bots, multiboxers, input broadcasters etc. all goes directly counter to CCPs current business model based on Eve style whales rather then majority of actual players.
---
Looking at your flair, it's clearly you that needs to hush.
---
Content will happen. Chicken and egg. There was a game and people played it. People started to fly together and content was created. When content creators are very few then guess what more people step up. Its how the game continues to work. People will naturally create content and others will want to join that content
---
Some Captchas are actually easier to solve for bots than they are for humans...   
---
This is just a really terrible solution really. 
---
The only people down voting are bitter vets
---
Aside from the NPC structures bit, you're describing shattered WH space.
---
it really isn't.
---
the end result is a random drop. whether it comes from a wreck or a box really doesn't matter.
---
you do some pve -&gt; you get a random item from a predetermined loot table.
---
The only way to do that is to remove excavators. I know a lot of y'all would do somersaults over that, but a lot of us that aren't controlling fleets of 20+ rorquals would be hugely impacted. The time to have spoken up about rorquals was before they made the changes to boosting, and the implementation of excavators. Years after the fact, not so much.
---
just like the drops contained within...
---
Intel channels with alliance wide gate / hole bots FTW stupid. Unless you're in an actually extra shitty one.
---
Im adapting myself back into CSGO
---
If your idea of enjoyment is to sit AFK in ur VNI then so be it
---
Ya pretty much
---
Lootboxes only take away from a natural and slow progression through time investment and shift those rewards to a pure and simple bet against the odds.   
---
it's get rich or die trying kind of thing and that's not sustainable ad infinitum, especially if the odds are in favor of the game. So, naturally: they are a bad thing and no game should ever have them, unless they are regulated by the law as casinos are.   
---
Law's will catch up as there is barely any lobby against gambling laws and gambling itself is regulated since forever. We just need to wait for a couple of years and legal jurisdiction will eliminate it. Until then, well. Don't buy them, ever. Not once. If you can that is. 
---
&gt;  shift those rewards to a pure and simple bet against the odds.
---
so, just like npc loot tables.
---
my fav happy little HAC
---
&gt; to reset your "free" checkbox counter
---
Yeah, no. There is no free checkbox counter, your way of checking the box (mouse movement, scrolling, etc) and your browser fingerprint is analyzed by an "AI", and if it isn't confident in you being a human, you'll have to solve one or more puzzles...
---
Actually clearing your cookies can make you more likely to get the puzzles.
---
All memes aside, more like just graduated to NCPLPH instead of replacing NCPL.
---
at least that genie is not Will Smith
---
Just to be clear, before the inevitable downvote brigade shows up, if such a radical nerf were done to the rorquals, I would simply sell my assets, and move on to another aspect of play. I wouldn't rage quit, or whine and cry. Adapt, overcome, move on.
---
What is the name for this new coalition?
---
Ah well, most loot tables have at least some form of guaranteed reward that's worth it in the end. Overseer's come to mind. So, you usually get something in return for the time invested into getting their.   
---
I agree though - I dislike any form of RNG, but I realize that some is necessary and it's just about finding a proper balance. Naturally, my approach is to vote against any form of extra RNG on top of what we already have. :)
---
Well yeah. So long that no capital vessels are involved, it's subcap content. That's the whole point mate.
---
Need more HAHA on it
---
Where about‚Äôs have you seen me in new Eden? I float around geminate a lot 
---
I dont play in null. So does not effect me one bit.

Didn't they already restage away from the immensea tenerifis area?
---
I will Pm you in discord
---
Dead(er) Coaltion
---
Especially the armor one where the normal Reactive armor hardener is way more plausible to fit. 
---
There were loads and loads of awesome lowsec cap battles back in the day. The whole "Super power dick slapping you in the face" shit never really happened and we fuckin dropped  carriers on everything that moved
---
You boys are the military mass of the coalition now. We and NCdot are the high end stuff with many titans. But past experience shows that alone does not win wars. You need masses of players in their t1 battleships slugging it out....and  nobody than the beans on our side.
---
&gt; Ah well, most loot tables have at least some form of guaranteed reward that's worth it in the end. 
---
no, they don't. that's what RNG is. there's no guarantee of anything.
---
I can understand why people don't like lootbox mechanics in other games - but they are totally different to what we've got at the guardian's gala.
---
other games - you pay irl money for exclusive items that can only be obtained from an RNG loot table you MUST fork over IRL cash for.
---
however, here, we have an item that doesn't require a real world payment - to loot an item from an RNG loot table - that you could just buy from the market if you're only after 1 specific item on the loot table.
---
nobody's forcing you to pay irl cash, or participate in a game of RNG roulette for any of the rewards in the boxes.
---
YouTube(Eng):42:15-43:00 Russians troll Legacy.
---
Doesn't matter where you live, most parts of EVE are fucked, be it WH sapce, null, low, high... 
---
The problem with these loot boxes is that they just suck and it seems like most of the time you don't even get back the Isk you have to put into it. If you just going them off of ships in the event it prob wouldn't be as bad.
---
They‚Äôre more interested in the CCW teenagers hopped up on skill injectors who got started because they saw 100 Goon Rorquals in a single belt.
---
I think you mean a lack of prioritizing your priorities. It takes a special type of person to really dive head first into EVE. It never was and never will be a major blockbuster game, it's too niche. So of course CCP is going to continue devoting money and resources into other projects to find that golden goose. 
---
and the loot they give out sucking is a valid criticism.
---
that's a hell of a lot different to almost every whine on r/eve so far that just goes "waaah muh gambling is bad bandwagon no thought post give me upvotes" bullshit.
---
z tier Soviet bloc formed lmao 
---
so we the infantry.  and NCPL is the heavy support.
---
sweet. Horde has grown so much =)
---
That's cool bro, tho my personal favorite is [Imicus](https://imgur.com/As6nuxP) (sorry for pic, being drunk af)
---
I like it.  Partial solutions are better than the no solutions offered by CCP.  At least for market bots.  And for ratbots in null players don‚Äôt show in local until after they break cloak.
---
It's almost as if it's my role on the subreddit to deal with those things.
---
&gt; your priorities. 
---
eve player priorities 
---
aint nothing wrong with being upset that the company that you give money to is spending it on other projects when the game ur playing is broke
---
great, bring me snacks.
---
You know that both PL and NC call PH if they need capitals ... or titans on field?          
---
Being teleported to some puzzle room just sound strange to me. Didn't Runescape add random events to deal with botting or is that a rumour?
---
Anyways, unless I somehow missed it, and if this idea were to be added it needs to be reworked. Boting around in a ratting carrier or bigger doesn't sound remotely fun, even for the reward at the end.
---
this was runescape's answer to botting about 10 years ago.
---
ab has been living in wh's for smallgang content for a long time, he's from hydra(?) with chessur (f), soldier forrester, intigo etc.
---
&gt; Didn't Runescape add random events to deal with botting or is that a rumour?
---
yeah, that's what Jagex did, about a decade or more ago.
---
Puzzle room may be the wrong idea, I'm trying to think of a better way to explain it. More like teleported to another anomaly in the system. The difference being this anomaly is not scannable and it requires some human input to navigate. Obviously sticking with the theme you were doing so it feels rewarding instead dog testing if you are a bot.
---
I can afford 1 or 2 skill extractors, if you want I can trade you those for skill injectors.
---
Oh want aware of that. Did it work? I was thinking more like an automated escalation to whatever you were doing. Maybe a wormhole opens and you are sucked through into a closed off protected instance. 
---
I'll have to look up what RuneScape did.
---
Just trying to think of ways that CCP could counter bots without affecting legit players and perhaps even rewarding them.
---
&gt; Did it work?
---
no. not even close.
---
But buying a faction drop off a ship isn't the same as buying a gambling ticket because you already know what you're getting...
---
Wait for Jove space.
---
Damn, could it have worked? Could the does have been implemented or tweaked in such a way that it could give CCP data to detect legit Vs bots. Machine learning etc can spot patterns just looking for a situation where those patterns could be fairly obvious!
---
but you know what you might get from a loot box - and all of it you can just buy directly if you're after a certain item on the loot table.
---
you know what you want - so just go and buy it.
---
He's right, that's some nice work right here =)
---
Watch this be the one idea they pull off of this sub 
---
Thanks Russia, very cool!
---
&gt; could it have worked?
---
no.
---
if i can do it - so can a bot.
---
you've made your devs spend hours, days, weeks, adding a minigame nobody wants, or likes... that botters will program their bot to solve in a few hours.
---
basically - you've just wasted everyone's time, and the amount of time/resources you've just wasted was far more than it took to trivialise all that effort.
---
O√Ø ! 
---
Just a question, OP : where did you find the sources for the characteristics of the ship ? Like the name of the propulsion systems, or the defensive plating and shield emitters ?
---
Do you just make up names, including corporations that could've worked on the design (like Boundless Creation and the Thukker tribes for the Vigil/Hyena), or do you have a cannon source ?
---
Thanks !
---
The only thing exciting to happen this year around so far, lets hope it gives more : )

Whats your point, NC and PL cal each other as well.

DV is in legacy, so that's the cowards pact broken.
---
Yes thats where i got most of the info. Added extra info for the redesign.
---
cool, so i cant post
---
I mean really it would be pretty simple, restrict it to triggering after x minutes, even an hour, of pve only activity. Bots could counter by dedicating two bots to a site and pointing each other or something but that means doubling the effort required on their part
---
Chances are its Dodixie. You can also check the minmatar hubs (Hek/Rens) where things tend to be ridiculously overpriced/better margins but you will also sell less often.
---
I would like to see CCP respond to \*any\* question about the event. They have said zero.
---
Exactly but how does CCP detect them? What are things that a human could do easily that a bot couldn't. Or what are things that a human could do without much inconvenience and a bot could potentially do but the bot would be easy to spot/detect.
---
'Frigates of EVE' is the cannon source for all the technical names except for, Advanced Hull Engineering. I made that part up.
---

---

---
It's not broken. Stop Exaggerating. 
---
not basically, they are. AFAIK they are the only all korean alliance around. The only other korean group I know of is the Snuff corp Wife is Sleeping
---
In null space where it's more lucrative could there genuinely be a delay or situation where location would not show. Maybe even an achor-able device like the cyno jammer that prevents local updating or hides the person who anchored it?
---
&gt;Or what are things that a human could do without much inconvenience and a bot could potentially do but the bot would be easy to spot/detect.
---
nothing - look at the most convenient ways to do things in eve right now.
---
it's shit that's all practically passive or self-automated.
---
the least inconvenient way of making isk while in space is by deploying drones, then ignoring the game for 10 mins until you need to warp to a new site. when a game requires such minimal input the difference between bots and legit players is already hilariously minimal.
---
Start a nuclear war.
---
it's hyperbole because there are people out there who legitimately feel the game is broken, which is what matters since their perception is the issue here, not the facts of the case.
---
factually there are definitely things not working as intended within the game, and that's the definition of broken so there are deffo things broken in the game
---
just remove it
---
:thinking:
---
Autistic Test pilots can do anything.

https://youtu.be/ulPgWVC08KI?t=35
---
i heard some crazy russians will try to evict the lovely pandas, should be good meme material
---
And the bots can do it faster. So, in the end it's the human pve player that suffers. 
---
The only thing I can point at and say was "broken" was the chat system. It has gotten better and I can see they are actively working on it. 
---
They just left the invasion front
---
judging by your post history no matter what you post it'll be sharked boyo.
---
We had more mod actions during the 'strike' than at any other point in the history of the sub. You do know it was basically a meme, right?
---
Local delay to a single ship class. Perhaps a new one dedicated to covert hunting. Then let players solve the botting issue. At least the ones not protected by mega empire capital umbrellas.
---
Why could we call this ship enterprise? 
---
depends on your definition of broken
---
if a system causes 90% of the players to vacate it in 3 years i'd call that system broken (factional warfare)
---
even if they can't (lets say there's some artificial barrier to stop it).
---
they won't make a mistake.
---
they don't get fatigued.
---
they don't get bored.
---
It doesn't really matter honestly. The amount of subreddits that have tried to effectively use stickies a lot for an extended period of time is *extremely* high. None have succeeded. You either need a topic so powerful that it can carry its weight regardless, or you need to do them rarely (such as a megathread).
---
Half or more of wh space is nearly this already.

taiwan numba wan
---
Eh, I hear that book's name coming from everywhere...
---
That's it ! I'm gettin' me wallet !
---

---
They dont cause inflation. They cause over supply of minerals.
---
Honestly, if bookies/casinos were set up like GG, where you realise after 2-3 spins that the deck is stacked and even a win pays you fuck all, there would be a lot less gamblers IRL... 
---
Let's try to explain from the perspective as somebody that still plays. 
---
Like a lot of the players quitting are older toons now the reasons are generally because the used to play in an eve that was more about pvp and less about well how can grind the hardest. 
---
There is also playstyle that comes into it like a lot of the angriest folks are pvpers that generally would fight in small groups ( small being relative here but think 10/20 dudes ). 
---
Now from there perspective the places you can get these fights are well slowly becoming less and less, like for small scale fighting eve becomes more and more of a game of how you can engage. 
---
Most of the big blocs are out of the question for small gangs, so it becomes a harder and harder time finding the type of fights these pilots enjoy at some point it honestly becomes a question of time put in and enjoyment returned.
---
Now the other group that is right now angry and there is some overlap is the tournament pilots, so eve has some dedicated players that play internet spaceship tournaments and well CCP dev's with some company support would run a yearly tournament. 
---
Well, it got canceled ( oke delayed for a year but most people suspect it won't be back next year ). 
---
Now a lot of these were very vocal and active players, so they tend to know there way around the eve social media and it's sorta why this issue has become so visible, now how this has a numerical impact has yet to be seen. 
---
I look forwaed to watching skill urself trash these losers 1v4 
---
Yup. But CCP smelled the money and cared less for getting the game in today's state... 
---
Smh just name her Armageddon

Sorta like you could make a mini-game dedicated to bot detection ( that humans can solve but machines can't ), the issue becomes these would not be fun to do and to come up with a unique solution is a pain.

I dunno I hope goons, tapi, panfam all stay out of it and just let them go at it. It has become very stale with them all involved in every fight that happens.

New coalitions looking for trouble is always good... what's the name of this one?
---
This is a subreddit where you get accused of being both anti and pro goon / nc / pl / test bias at the exact same time for every possible interaction. Everyone tries to manipulate every possible situation into some form of 'mod bias' accusation to get someone in an alliance they don't like out or someone from their alliance in. Pretty much every possible decision you can make will have a group shitting on you as hard as possible and they go straight for the jugular.

I hear SMA is back in Querious. That might be even more to your liking.
---
first eve tat ive seen in 13 years that¬¥s not top tier cringe. gratz for that i guess. 
---
LOOK AT HOW AGED I AM, THAT MEANS MATURITY THEREFORE MY OPINIONS ARE BETTER MADE!
---
&gt; I see debating with you further as a waste of my time.
---
UH OH.
---
xix and red, pffft
---
XIX will never Failscade, We have to many members who care about who we are and what we stand for to let anyone Hit the Delete key on us!
---
I see people bringing up "Ohh x corp left the alliance" and "oh u fucked over that dude" literally not knowing wtf they are saying only spewing out roomers they here without the full story..... XIX will not failscade even now as we are fighting outmatched numbers we are still doing what we need to do.
---
I like to look at things from a surprising perspective, A Goonswarm perspective.... If 90% of eve can pound an alliance the size of goonswarm literally making them outnumberd worse then we are now and they are still in game. Seriously XIX has fuck all to worry about.
---
Now get back to your mining you gopnik shit's
---
Sounds like some PC bullshit to me.
---
how much?
---
Zombie Co?
---
There already scripts for solving those, all its going to do is piss off legitimate players.
---
It's safe to assume that if XIX is doing anything resembling not ratting it means Legacy is going to be max forming for each timer.
---
Flavor text is definitely something lacking on hulls...sadly maruders are not very useful outside of PvE
---
Interesting use of withered too, nc do not field as many subs but we get close.
---
in that fight were the 200 dreads died.  The super numbers were almost equal between PH and NC.  Think it something like PH had one super and NC had a few more titans
---
The Far-Eastern Front
---
Right?!  Look at the comments... Diatribes... So. Many. Words.
---
the main problem besides CCP being retarded is that the playberbase funneled new players into ezmode F1 mashing themepark rides. see gons, PH, brave and co. you will never make serious content creators out of a punch of casual pingwarrior fags. 
---
Me and 6 friends have not resubbed.  That is 21 accounts total. 
---
We have all been playing for at least 10 years. Ccp has at best months to respond before the game dies (many of us expect that is their plan anyway)
---
&gt; that humans can solve but machines can't
---
motherfucker, i don't know if it's an I or an l on most captchas, bots beat me at those damn things.
---
Bisu with 80 iq posts again
---
I'm sure reddit will think of something!
---
I remember the first day of faction warfare. Everyone hurried to a recruiter and signed up. Was part of the Caldari militia and we had to defend some system against hundreds of Gallente militia guys. System was a huge lag fest and huge Caldari congaline was formed due to the lag. The end of the line was a big Gallente fleet alpha'ing every Caldari to oblivion. After the lag disappeared we formed small hunting fleets with just random ships, from bombers to battleships, a true kitchen sink fleet. Started to harass the Gallente guys and we managed to get some kills.  
---
The wormhole expansion was kinda the same. Soon it happened we all gathered in a lvl 4 mission system and formed small 10 man fleets of random people I never seen before with again random ships from frigs to battleships. We entered the wormhole to see where it lead us too. Warped our fleet to a drifter site and that was a bad idea as allot of us were dying to the drifters. The end of the day we had lots of fun.
---
Sansha incursions. For some reason I managed to get into Sansha's wormhole. Never found it again... dammit. 
---
Oh really? Excitement intensifies. Is there any good way to third party this as faithful Americans?
---
Your thrasher fleet were shitting on us, meanwhile other parts of minmil where in fleet with us...
---
Rook is what I was used to run those sites (idea taken from one of iBeast streams, and many more players also used this before of course):  
---
[Rook, Besiege]  
---
Ballistic Control System II  
---
Pith B-Type Large Shield Booster  
---
Thukker Large Cap Battery  
---
Adaptive Invulnerability Field II  
---
Shield Boost Amplifier II  
---
Pith X-Type Kinetic Deflection Field  
---
Heavy Assault Missile Launcher II, Scourge Rage Heavy Assault Missile  
---
Medium Ancillary Current Router II  
---
Medium Capacitor Control Circuit II  
---
Hobgoblin II x5  
---
Scourge Rage Heavy Assault Missile x330  
---
Pick Mobile Depo and refit for MWD\cloak if you need it.  
---
Rook is convenient (doesn't attract much attention for obvious reasons, has great defense against Mordus).  
---
Stopped doing those sites because risk\reward involved is not that great anymore and CCP never updated loot tables since site introduction (30-day Guristas skins, seriously?)
---
Hope you won't get scared by your arm in night
---
Probably also safe to assume Tri posters will be whining on reddit.
---
how the fuck u say, that u ever fight outnumbered? since 2016 u didnt fight any alliance that did outnumber u. U got evicted by forces with 1/4 of your alliance size o_o
---
Yay! Conflict
---
I look forwaed to it too. 
---
FRT does have some international based pets and Corps.
---
Skillu might get involved, it's content right in their doorstep.
---
&gt;so I just did incursions all day because they were fun for me. (which is also where I spent most of my isk - on blingy mods)
---
So you spent the entire of your play time grinding isk, then had nothing to do with it because all you wanted to do was grind isk? 
---
Incursions came the year after WHs, the game at that point was in the best state it had ever been in with so much fucking content it was unreal. The fact you didn't have anything to do reflects on your inability to actually do something.
---
If you started much later than this, then you were around for the first balance phase of FW, or the 3 wars that have been fought between the north blocs, as well as the liberation of provi. **There was plenty to do**, you just chose to count your iskies instead.
---
No, this is a shit post.

lmao why the gold for a random sarcastic remark?

This event seems to have been thrown for no other reason than to intro loot boxes. Just wait until the next one where they offer the option to buy "premium" loot boxes for PLEX
---
dead? o.0  dead alliance isn't part of Panfam.  they still hiding in AUTZ 
---
Can you put the TLDR first next time?  Holy wall of text.  Gist of it basically being:  CCP determined the China market is ripe and is expanding there.

Was talking about the bloke above you, gotg is interesting
---
&gt;We and NCdot are the high end stuff with many titans
---
Pretty sure PH brought more supers and titans to the last TEST dread dunk than pathetic legion did.
---
You're right, but I think wrong at the same time. Me snd my friends are all 10-15 year vets. We're quitting because the game has lost its risk and reward. I do not have a lot of time to play, so when I do play it needs to actually matter
---
&gt; no, they don't. that's what RNG is. there's no guarantee of anything.
---
Overseer's Personal Effects is a 100% drop.
---
I'm guessing "goons" here are imperium + legacy, cause FRT only attacked Legacy back then.
---
I simply reduced your diarrhea-wordy post into a fiber-filled single turd.  The end result is the same!
---
You are right. But when the battle is already won....no need to bring in the reserves
---
WH space means messing around with probes which while simple, is boring as fudge.
---
tri noobs owned))
---
I think Tom Clancy wrote a book about this one.
---
then you were one of the very few dumb people who didn't dock the rest of us went hunting bots.
---
&gt; no ones that stupid

Have you seen some of the loss mails from real people in this game? There is ALWAYS someone that stupid.

Sound like High-sec

Hello Friend. Your post got caught by automod. I've approved it but since its a few hours old if you want to delete this one and repost it, we are okay with that.
---
" but I feel like it would be so much better if they had just sold it 6 years ago. " It tooks 6 months for loot boxes to show up after the sale.... if it had been sold 6 years ago we'd already be in the pay to win version of the game.
---
It's a start. It's not like baiting with a hull tank is some impossible feat.
---
Be careful getting tattoos in Thailand m8, Phuket can be crazy. 
---
yeah your right, you guys bringing a jackdaw fleet to a super/cap fight probably wouldn't have mattered in the grand scheme of things.
---
The only problem with this theory is CCP lack of effort in marketing and the style of the game itself don't allow for a massive influx of players to replace the ones they are driving out.
---
&gt; that's worth it in the end.
---
shame it doesn't meet this part of the criteria, though :P
---
Yeah, my bad, it devalues minerals which is sold to buy plex, increasing the demand for plex.  2.1 billion ISK now. 
---
i'd rather have bots then those damn picture captcha's  tired of picking out those traffic lights 
---
Next it is Skilless Urself! Roflmaobbq. Drones is soon ded. 
---
This is so sad. Aura, play Bellow the Asteroids.
---
...oh right, there is no jukebox in EVE...
---
Cba with holes and probing 
---
It's a "free" escalation you get from running anomalies or scanning down combat sites. 10/10s net you an OPE worth 134M ISK.
---
Zombified
---
I disagree. We're just missing players who you know... Undock and play pew pew. 
---
You guys were the shit man. At first we couldn't figure out wth was happening. I was logi in the earlier part of the fight so mad respect. 
---
I think you need to delete this post then.
---
That dread only took 666000 damage to die? That's not very much. I recently saw an occator take close to 76000. Are dreads weak or something? I always though they were tough.
---
It's like that Cheshire Cat tattoo every basic emo chick has but shitty.
---
"It's safe to assume that if XIX is doing anything resembling not ratting it means Legacy is going to be max forming for each timer."
---
They already are and the Russians haven't even undocked yet 
---
One of the points I was trying to make is that that‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs always been, they purposefully don‚Äôt mess with the balance too much, for better or worse.
---
This too shall pass, eventually I guess
---
You can not blame the players for that. CCP has allowed game mechanics that promote that play style and have even encouraged it, it is part of the watering down of the game. CCP has constantly made it more difficult for small groups and new content creators. Every change CCP has made makes it easier for the large groups to mold new players in to F1 monkeys that only log on for the frags. 
---
2nd biggest supercap fleet in the game currently! As a coalition ofc lol not just horde
---
there is TONS of speculation here...other than that, this post is basically "grrrr, injectors." - complaining about something that's been in the game for 3 years now
---
I'll save my outrage for when they actually start introducing P2W mechanics. We haven't seen anything close to what eastern MMOs offer yet.
---
sure - but you're also guaranteed rat bounties etc. the OPE isn't really loot in the sense that it's not an item you can do anything with - it's just a token.
---
like, i get your point that you're guaranteed it as a drop - but it's just more guaranteed cash like bounties are.
---
Russians unite.... looks like an interesting 2019.
---
I sort garbage and clean shit, not eat it. 
---
BOLLOCKS....only in period basis are at least 50 to 70 bots(vni and domies)at any given time...botting is so bad mate,and dumm fuck ccp give them thetering and infinite anoms
---
its called meatshield
---
As others have mentioned RuneScape tried that and you know what I was actually botting in that game. It was so fun at first watching the bot solve all the ‚Äúrandom events‚Äù to the point where I forgot they existed. People always find ways to bypass all of these things, some bots are build to scan item IDs, colors etc and they react accordingly.
---
The point is to make it risky not reduce their yield.
---
it'd just be more empty null systems but with worse logistics.
---
It sounds like it's some kind of coallition instead of central alliance with bunch of pets kept around.
---
DOA
---
Lol. Good luck.
---
yep =D
---
and soon i'll be part of that fleet &lt;.&lt;  *goes back to buying the modules one by one*
---
whoever made deadspace A adaptive energized modules 1.3b........when they only have 1% more resist than faction for 56m.....i despise you...
---
Nah, we just anchored 5 keepstars to secure immensea and skillu decided redeploying to insmother sounded like more fun. 
---
Cant wait for the frat nip to expire, march 22 I believe is the day. 
---
who?
---
What you described is like hisec without CONCORD mixed with shattered wormholes.
---
It's Thera with a local and hisec-like cynojamming.
---
if I get a captcha popup, I'll just skip my last bounty tick and quit for the day
---
Has nothing to do with why plex prices are high. Plex prices are high because people are no longer willing to spend real money on a dieing game. 
---
70% reduction in MJD cooldown time would want to have a word with you.
---
And flavor text for ships that have it tends to be pretty great, I liked reading descriptions of AT hulls.
---
Well, it definitely gets interesting if someone comes to break the camp. Maybe the post is there because they're bored?
---
Did you know that wormholers have their own subreddit.        
---
All people that lived and live in WH space subscribed to it.       
---
Check it r/wormholers/
---
They said zero about most comp,ains in last days. Shows how they deal with complains and issues. They dont give a fuck mate.

we wont be able to resist content of the magnitude on our border

---
Fundamentally you can‚Äôt just buy a PLEX and keep rolling NPC sites until you run out of ISK without leaving the station like you can with these lootboxes though.
---
I get there‚Äôs other ways to lose ISK in the game, but in the time it takes to buy a ship and fittings, fit it, run a site and either die or loot it, you can just buy a bunch of these over and over until your balance is too low to buy anymore.
---
Doubtful. It will be most likely more shit along the lines of: Buff Rorquals, make a change to so-and-so in order to show the sheep that we're doing something instead of nothing and they STFU but in reality the change will be a joke and everything will either remain the same or we'll end up with even more Rorqs and cap proliferation etc.
---
For gatecamping, you can get one fastlock tackle (Daredevil is great, due to web bonus) and put rest of your alts in Dominixes, drop/assist sentries, put remote reps on your tackle. You anchor a bubble(s) that cover 10km sphere around the gate and wait for something to jump into you or land in the bubble, with 90% web strength you can quickly stop someone from crashing back and having assist will circumvent poor scanres of battleship. It's reasonably cheap, can kill bunch of stuff and with MJD you're likely to save at least some ships if something goes awry.
---
Or just go full Olmeca and do 6-alt bomb runs aiming at barges/excavators.
---
i thought that was the Hyperion 
---
Made me laugh out loud. I spend all day reading dumbass comments like the one you replied to.
---
 Addiction is a chronic disease and I am sure many of us either personally or have family members battling with it. However, to use your comparison with alcoholism, vendors do not stop selling alcoholic beverages because they might be enabling addicts.  
---
I do not like loot boxes in general and especially the way CCP implemented it this event... one of the worst loot box mechanics I have seen. However, majority of players that do open loot boxes are not addicts, they enjoy to gamble or want a chance at the reward they otherwise cannot get.
---
If CCP is going to keep these type of loot boxes, it should be transparent with a clear break down of what you can get and at what rate.  
---
That's not how project Discovery works.. 
---
(It was a CODE. explaining what he did)
---
Good. Dragon fleet, you may enter

Legacy coalition member invades cowards pacted group. You going to tell me that doesn't break said cowards pact?

Samm (FRT English FC) gonna have aneurism. On top of yelling at her brainless hamsters she will have to yell at Russians too
---
Somewhat speculative but possibly some truth in it. Particularly when you look at what other major games companies are doing.
---
There is a huge growing eastern market which has (sadly) led to a shift of P2W and mobile games.
---
It absolutely makes sense than an Eastern Investor wants to shepherd products in this direction.
---
Personally I think this will mostly come from their new products - EVE Mobile and their new MMO. However it makes sense to try and monetise and market their existing game in that direction, even if it doesn‚Äôt achieve a huge focal shift.
---
I‚Äôm guessing EVE will be a dish on the platter that appeals to the new player-base. Like EVE mobile? Try EVE desktop!
---
There is no XIX post without a salty TRI member reply 
---
The moment someone invents something like that, they'll definitely not stay in CCP to keep it in game. Having a working way to distinguish human from dedicated bot is worth a fortune.
---
&gt; that moment PH is the name people call Panfam instead of NCPL.
---
&gt; people
---
calling stainguy that is a bit of a stretch
---
And they spend in game money on it instead. In game money they get from super carrier ratting, running corporations, or rorqual mining. It's not directly part of the problem like vni botting, but it certainly has *something* to do with plex prices. 
---

I think you took my comment as something it wasn't. 
---
Eve is notoriously hard to iterate on as some segments are lacking in comments or have comments so indecipherable they would rather significantly re-invent the wheel than try to fix. Thats the entire reason for the move to upwell structures, POS's (forcefields? - IIRC) we so impossible to work on they had to come up with an entirely new system. 
---
After enough TIDI slugfests crashing to desktop, Im 100% behind a 64 bit client. That said, your assumption they can easily move to one is a stretch based on what we know about the almost 20 year history of this game.
---
A week?  My aren't we the generous one.  I give it less than 24 hours, and a week before CCP is pressured to remove it to just shut up the massive amounts of "REEEEEEE!"
---
XDeath must have renewed his mortgage and needs dank RMT ticks again.
---
You seem sad and bitter.
---
The bots i saw could handle them too, it was hilarious
---
Oh, sorry, I just picked a time that would nearly 100% guarantee the result. You know, your regular risk averse attitude.
---
It has **nothing** to do with inflation.... rorquals do not print isk....
---
inflation != plex prices
---
What if someone is remote cap transfering you instead of nueting you?
---
I just find it funny the former super elite pvp gods of the game now run around in jackdaws and bomber fleets.
---
Russian so vodka?
---
fair enough :D
---
....you make zero sense but dont want to concede when you're wrong. that's cool, you do you beau.
---
Then why are you talking about plex prices after incorrectly claiming rorquals cause inflation? 
---
&gt;and they can mine tons of ore for hours while afk, causing inflation.
---
You're wrong. Deal with it
---

&gt; Blaming the players for that would be like handing a 2 year old a bucket of mud in your living room, and then getting mad when he smears mud on your floor.
---
that¬¥s like saying you can¬¥t blame people ordering usb cables on amazon for the death of local retailing. unless they¬¥re 2 years old. which they aren¬¥t. and neither are most eve players (at least regarding their physical age).  
---
&gt; OP then be prepared for the completely irrelevant consequences because this is an internet chat forum for a spaceship MMO.
---
good job reading the OP
---
Yeah, but think of poor nullsec if they can't hotdrop us for content or bash our citadels. 
---
&gt; It's not directly part of the problem like vni botting, but it certainly has *something* to do with plex prices. 
---
I admit that my earlier statement about them affecting inflation was wrong. I thought I made that clear earlier, but looking back, I certainly didn't. Please excuse me for the confusion. 
---
Not really all your doing is picking a problem that's hard for machines to solve and then building it into the game. 
---
All your really doing is making a captcha in game form ( preferably in a fun game form ). 
---
you know what's in the box.
---
just buy it directly.
---
Meatshield is still.a meatshield 
---
well we all know that test is goon's meatshield. what else is new
---
I m pretty sure you have never fced even a 3 man gang moda faka
---
My point is that people will always play within the boundaries that CCP gives us, and people will always take the path of least resistance. It is CCP's job to recognize when that path is bad for the game and correct mechanics that promote that play style.
---
Did not know that, thanks
---
Also never lived in a wormhole, but i think i would want to someday.
---
Because communism. 
---
&gt;it devalues minerals which is sold to buy plex, increasing the demand for plex. 2.1 billion ISK now.
---
Is what you said which also makes zero sense what so ever. 
---
Yeah, that's it...can't think of a role for them outside PvE and solo/small gang stuff
---
Yeah. You being a retard.
---
lmao imagine being in tri 
---
Very legal!
---
[DHSJ is turning our frogs gay!](https://imgur.com/a/ZO8NWuD)

Awww, don't use words that hurt, turn that frown upside down!
---
you're trying to compare a glorified bounty payment, to loot.
---
From past experience at least, Horde stays out of a relatively large amount of Fraternity's business. Seems most of our involvement is content related - if there's a convenient wormhole then we're probably showing up
---
how about CCP just pogrom bots rather than only handing out a few token bans when the community reaches boiling point
---
Preach, sister.
---
People who mine sell the rocks for ISK. They spend the ISK on plex. They don't buy plex. Now there's less plex on the market. Demand for plex is the same, because the same people need new plex next month. Therefore plex prices go up. 500 plex is currently around 2.1 billion ISK at Jita prices.
---
Rocks get reprocessed into minerals. More rocks means more minerals. If demand for rocks increases at the same rate, then they don't lose value. If demand for rocks stays the same or decreases, then the rocks lose value. 
---
Please let me know if there's anything that's not clear. You do agree there's a reason people are complaining about injectors and rorquals, right? 
---
:ok_hand:

aww &lt;3

&gt; My point is that people will always play within the boundaries that CCP gives us, and people will always take the path of least resistance
---
sure, and i can blame them for being the shortsided idiots they are. as in 
---
&gt; the main problem besides CCP being retarded is that the playberbase funneled new players into ezmode F1 mashing themepark rides. see gons, PH, brave and co. you will never make serious content creators out of a punch of casual pingwarrior fags.
---
Yu really don't even understand basic economic concepts 
---
I mean I agree, it should be simple enough... I'm just thinking of how CCP could do a CCP and botch it up somehow :p
---
Just have more NPC Titans and dreads spawn. They will take care of the butters.
---
Now, this is a good gaming tattoo.
---
Would be deserted and forgotten within a month.
---
i mean hasn't goons and RA been friends since forever
---
Then you just wasted a whole ship to support with cap like 3 lazy people who could just fit active T2 hard....    
---
It is not that this will make this module OP and used on every possible capital ship.        
---
Like if you know where you jumping or if you assume omni damage - you can just use T2 hards any way ... or even faction and still go cheaper. 
---
Hey there. I do quite a bit of industry and really enjoy it. I'm a long time eve player but have focused on industry for the past year with great success. /essage me ingame at stupidnoob7 and I'll be happy to work with you. Rigs are a great place to start becsuse t1 BPOs are cheap and you don't need them researched since t2 doesn't need a t1 version. Like most things in eve though it's a matter of how much time and money you want to invest and how often you want to check up on. It does take some time to dial the process in. But yea message me in game and we can talk more. If you want to join my Corp you can use our BPOs. We are just a handful of people living in high sec near jita. We have more than 350 unique bpos.

Ah nice so goons test and init are deploying to help them ima guess
---
&gt;(anything far off enough to ‚Äúlikely‚Äù miss a warp bubble)
---
warping at range doesn't protect you from bubbles. If the direction of your warp passes through the bubble, and the end point is within 500km of it (either ahead or behind) you will get dragged into (or stopped by) the bubble regardless. And if the bubble is not placed inline with your warp, then you can warp to 0 as normal. A non-nullified ship simply isn't safe from a bubble camp in lowsec, although covert frigates can usually get through if they don't get decloaked. 
---
Additionally, warping to 100km to every single gate is a huge pain in the ass, and entirely unnecessary. 
---
Bubbles don't exist in lowsec, which is the area of space I was writing about. 
---
I think, if a person is super ratting, they should have to make a petition once a week for thier isk. And wait a short while to have someone check and make sure it's legit. Hate me if you want, but it will change hot the bots are ratting. Also, CCP has permissions to check out computer for scripts running in the background. If your bot is using scripts ccp can detect those. (All bots use scripts.)

Those captchas work by seeing if the way the mouse moves looks human-like.
---
It'd be more effective and less intrusive to just monitor the mouse's movement in the background and at random intervals.
---
No stupid pop-ups, no captcha solvers, no bots.
---
Talked about this with ccp guard at one of the evesterdams for a bit, basicly boiled down to:
---
If they have eve accounts before joining ccp they get frozen when joining.
---
They are allowed to create new accounts after joining ccp under different names, but they have to keep themselves anomynous.
---
They are not allowed to use any programs that can reveal their IP (mumble, irc, alliance forums, etc...)
---
This offcourse makes it difficult to join larger groups because they all useally require some sort of talk on comms and registering on services. So it requires somebody high level enough within an alliance to vouch you in without that being nessecary, an example that came to mind was a CSM member thanks to their NDA's already in place. At the time he said there were a few ccp employees in some of the null sec blocks, but most don't bother.
---
I've no idea why CCP keeps screwing around with the event formula, they've run plenty of successful ones since they've started them. Ever since they've moved it to the agency they only gotten shittier and shittier.

No.  You are falsely claiming that people care.  I'm certain that if there was a true and accurate poll of the actual playerbase, the majority of people don't even know what the AT even is.  Of those of us who do, many of us are disheartened that it is going away THIS YEAR, but it is meh, not really on our list of priorities.  The list of people who actually care about the AT is pretty limited to those who actually have a chance to participate and win prizes.

Just run the script again afterwards. It timing out is just Google killing it. First run you do to static all the data will take 2-4 runs of it

Make users install retinal trackers on thier monitors, track mouse and eye movement, and compare the results. (Not a serious suggestion btw)

Do we have translators for this?

 Thorax.

So what does that make the rest of imperial legacy outside of goons and test?
---
Whereas comms are typically more interesting than dubstep, in this case, I'll take the dubstep.
---
It's really not that simple. Your currently logged in google account (and some other factors) will factor into your "reputation" that decides whether you get a further prompt or not.
---
Do citadels have different anchor time in nS  like NPC null or sov owned null ? If for exemple i'm not the sov holder ?

If you can avoid having HAW dreads dropped on them, marauders are pretty good from the pvp vids I've seen.

---
No one has had any problems with exploration so far, but you can get cans that are literally empty, or cans with 100+ mil. The only difference with this site is opening a can costs isk, but that‚Äôs not really the problem, the problem is that the average payout is far too low 
---
God that trailer was so bad ass. Probably my favorite.
---
I miss cool trailers like that.
---
Nice paragraph 
---
I dont know, why you directing all your thoughts to CCP, game is owned by Pearl Abyss now and we all know their monetization in other games. So it is pretty expected, thet p2w and casino stuff shows there.
---
Nice try mining bot
---
wubba lubba dub dub
---
Normal ratters know they get reimbursed for losses while local is down. So as long as you make enough isk to cover the fit, you‚Äôre still isk positive 
---
Yeah, you did against a skill urself content deployment deployment and have chest beated about the NIP for at least three weeks in virtually every channel. 
---
Or the content should be easy enough for a human but almost impossible for a bot, like the abyss.
---
Yeah, something stupid. You guys rocked a Goon fleet with Gila's didnt you?
---
We went to nullsec or something silly.
---
What about razor, midas 22, diplomatic immunity and patriots? They coming, too?
---
Or run through 4chan.
---
I don't know mate. The majority of the wrecks appear to be empty. Suggests he just forgets to scoop after emptying. Or else he just has a lot of ISK to burn. I think the point is that there are no kills and the only losses are the MTUs.
---
What problem?
---
Plz just go on perma strike
---
you had 0 minmil in your fleet. there were no militia on grid that wasn't in our fleet already. Besides, there are no other parts of minmil that are US and willing to join large scale stuff as far as I'm aware. 
---
&gt; The only hard thing with that is finding the targets and tackling them. Yeah, super hard. You had to work for it. Yeah. 
---
Have you ever done it? Let's see.
---
&gt; And what would you do if there is no citadel because capable players killed it? Whoops. 
---
TIL You need a 50k coalition to kill citadels...THEN you can 5 man roam to kill people.
---
&gt; Because of the alliance, yes. You can take that away. Then you have the advantage in your favor. 
---
"Just kill the alliance and then you have the advantage vs a krab." Really?
---
&gt; Ever heard of the term "Renters" which are just that by definition cause they receive no support from their landlord? 
---
Glad we're catering the game to renters. But anyway don't know what shitshow of a rental program you are part of but that's not always the rule.
---
&gt; You argue the same way. :) 
---
Sorry for "elite arguing." In any case you're still misrepresenting what I say.
---
&gt; Yeah and how would I do PvE in that? :) 
---
Shoot rats. You can still shoot rats in pvp fits. See you have "all the tools" you just gotta do it.
---
&gt; Again, the idea is not that "kill down the Alliance" ...these systems dead (more dead than already). This leads to less PvE in there and subsequently: less PvP too. 
---
Most people in 0.0 live in alliances. And 0.0 should be dangerous.
---
&gt; Why is that? because PvP activity increases with the ammount of PvE activity. You said it yourself, killing crabs "isn't exiting but it's a try to provoke... of your reach? 
---
Problem is krabbing is just too safe. It really is. Unless someone actually pushes to threaten your space, you either grind your losses way faster than you lose, or you have easy safe areas because of all the aforementioned reasons.
---
&gt; Yes exactly, so what makes you think removing the only advantage that is able to counter the agressors advantages in the absence of an alliance (which provides the other advantages) is the way to counter that? 
---
Again there is no mythical "0.0 krab with no alliance." Why would you expect someone without an alliance to be viable out in 0.0 krabbing?
---
&gt; To kill keepstars with dreads you only need a dozen people and some dread alts. You don't need similar numbers at all. 
---
The fact that you are saying this seriously really shows to me you haven't played the game to any extensive amounts. You expect a small gang group of a dozen people to kill a Keepstar. Let's do this. Why don't you try doing that? Lead by example. Or you can just tell me. What Keepstar. You tell me. Tell me the system and let's see if we can figure out together where problems may arise.
---
&gt; So your argument is "I can't assemble enough people". Rhetorical question: do you think using a, let's say a 12 man gang to drop a VNI is ... with a gang of 10/100/1000/10000/100000 in order to deal with his self inflicted handicap? 
---
Better solution. Create group pve sites that require people to work together. Fair?
---
&gt;and that is undeniably true. I never argued against that. I argued against removing local because of it because you can, infact, remove all the other advantages. If you want to make life easier for small gangs, removing local has severe consequences for everyone that isn't in alliance that protects it's members and doesn't solve the issues you have.  
---
&gt;... (shortened for the sake of length)  
---
&gt; However, it's a playstyle that causes problems too - you are faced with advantages you can't break with "conserving" isk and if CCP gets you into a position where you can easily afford to lose a super while not having to worry as much about how you replace it, then I think THAT would truly help.
---
It's not that tackling a rorqual is hard. But you drop a bubble on the rorq, it lights a cyno, titans come through. End of fleet. The things you say that are "so easy to remove" are only removable if you have a massive alliance or they aren't defended. The idea PvE will stop without local or limited local is proven wrong by every wormhole group out there. How do they do it?
---
&gt; So, for you it's only worth playing if you can kill stuff the enemy can't replace and that's fair and all, but not a general rule. 
---
This has ALWAYS been a major appeal for Eve Online. Losses don't matter in other MMORPGs and pretty soon they won't (or right now) don't matter much as is because of the proliferation of krab favoring factors.
---
&gt; well, when you can't even commit to having adequate tools to prevent rorquals from warping off (a bubble), then I can't see any ..., is either just a bad example or leads to the conclusion you don't want to commit a dictor. 
---
Because a 5 man group tackling a rorqual doesn't have enough DPS to break it and more than likely will get a cyno and supers dropped on them. So why would we do this? It's not impossible and the group I'm flying with has done it before. But it's not something very common.
---
Cool man. Thanks for watching!
---
&gt;When it takes a dozen people with a ton of isk to kill a defended keepstar, then your argument is invalid. You have this kind of hit and run guerilla playstyle at your disposal, but you chose to not do it this way because it's too expensive. ... other thread - you are trying to kill tanks with simple bullets but you can't afford an RPG either. The tools are there, you simply can't afford them and that is the core problem.
---
Not even that. Using your example the core problem is that injectors and krab safety make it so EVERYONE has a tank now. When before you had to have a certain amount of time commitment to be able to even fly a super, now everyone can do it. Caps need nerfed but that's a different discussion. Titans and Supercaps have no business being able to hit most subcaps.
---
&gt;I could go with the obvious answer of: Logintraps, Spy-Alt-Awoxing etc. but I don't really want that, instead I would like to know:  
---
&gt;why do you think avoiding a fight is problematic? Isn't small gang all about avoiding fights you can't win while picking the fights you can win? Why is it a problem if the krab can do that just like you do all the freaking time? Why shouldn't the krab be able to avoid the fight with you? EXPLAIN this to me.  
---
&gt;To me, it sounds like you are entitled to the idea that you can chose who lives and who dies. It doesn't work this way.
---
Well in order for me to avoid a fight I need to have scouts, I need to plan my escape going through enemy territory, when cornered I have to log off in hostile space (like I did last night) and plan a way to get out. There's so so much more effort and strategy in that. For the Isthar krab...align...warp....safe.
---
&gt;you try to defend the wrong argument. You do have all the options that you need available and yes, bringing 1000 titans is nothing that you couldn't do - thus, it IS an option. You just chose to not commit to it. The argument is: "it's too hard for me to do that and it's unfair that life was made easier for krabs when my solutions only got tougher to execute".  
---
&gt;Yes, arguing that it's too hard for you to do is a different argument altogether, but a fair one. Crying that you can't isn't.
---
It's not about crying and we can pretty much move on from insulting one another. It's boring at this point and I think we've gone through all the names we can use. It's this shift from a more combative nature of Eve into something more tame. And that's what bothers me. It's becoming a sim city simulator.
---
&gt; Yes you do. You want to force your idea of balance onto me even though you obviously don't have a clue about how I play the game and... recognizes the problems it will cause. You know, just like changes should be made. Not the CCP way, I know. 
---
If we had limited local I would also push for a revamp of pve that encourages "small gang ratting" with essentially pvp fits instead. PvE has always kind of been "meh" in this game." Catering to it further will weaken the game. We need a reformat on multiple levels.
---
Red said they would spend one month prepping in Tenerifis which is around the amount of time till Test's nip ends with Frat. That and our staging moves suggest that Test will be backing them up.
---
Tl;dr is usually reserved for the end of a post, I guess I could have said that there was a tl;dr at the beginning.
---
You almost have the gist but I was also pushing for CCP not really caring what happens to the remnants of the west. Adapt to the new order or fade away.
---
Or they don't play... and Eve dies...
---
The advantage of your previous years of experience in Eve is just that.... Experience in the gameplay.
---
A day one character who has never heard of Eve.... who drops 1k in real money to buy the "blingy ships" has no clue how to fly them.... and gets wrecked by experienced players.
---
XIX had a separate meeting with RAZOR members where they said they really want RAZOR to stay and they will keep their SOV but its up to them if they want to. They probably will due to them being together for like four years.
---
Far too early for marketing to Asian audiences. For one the mobile game isn't out and generating interest in the IP.
---
Also, we are still here. Doesn't make for a good environment with us here.
---
Perhaps I didn't emphasize that I foresee more of a trickle from eastern audiences as more transition from mobile to pc. I think I used to word influx too much to be talking about a trickle.

I got the samw but with abyssal threw some bils in its shit and not worth the isk but i am slightly better then his stats

The Russian Federation?
---
I mean yes.. I did outline that this is pure theory and speculation. Without internal business plans or being able to see into the future we will never know. 
---
I don't really see how this is "grrrr, injectors." I barely spare them 3 sentences and define them as a pay to advance feature. Nowhere do I call injectors pay to win, because they aren't... 
---
No we don;t have any P2W yet.. yet. They will come. Slowly but surely as EVE transitions to an eastern mmo. Scale of a year or two. Enough to be barely noticeable and somewhat tolerbale to the ignorant. 
---
im sure his reply was a bait reply too.

they should have paid more for a longer nip
---
ah i guess tributaries don't get to decide the terms of their tribute though
---
I hope not, this seems like none of our business tbh
---
Exactly my points but in far less words. Could have saved me some time typing.
---
I hadn't considered the new MMO, perhaps an Asian MMO to wet their feet at pure P2W mechanics?
---
Alas all my points are speculative. Without foresight or internal business plans I can only make educated guesses.

The state of eve with spies and ease of movement etc will likely mean the large groups will turn up because they know whats going on and where. Boredom is the largest driving factor these days.

&gt; was consistently pushed down.

wut, if you want to fc something just make a fleet and get people to join? what are they gonna do, prohibit you from making fleets?

this sounds awfully like some dude who fced two roams, got his shit pushed in on both -which is normal, no one is born good at it-  then gets assblasted he wasn't allowed to lead stratops with just that under his belt.

---
TAPI in fact might be the main driving force in this conflict, because actual invasion is timed for NIP expiry. This new "coalition" (half of which are already test pets) just can't take on frat alone, not even close in power levels and timezone discrepancy
---
Intel gathering can be somewhat difficult if you don't have higher up spies. Unless the enemy is moving shit it's hard to get a true assessment of assets, their locations, and how that force can be projected. It's better to have good intel on a prepared enemy than no intel on an unprepared enemy. At least when you're mitigating risk.
---
And of course when it takes a week to destroy shit you'll already be telegraphing your moves.

It's kind of funny how it happened too. Snuff was fighting in caps so we downshipped from our Abaddons/Guards and threw Punishers at everyone. Then we got word they were running to Arzad and we were just like "Punishers are invincible anyway! CHARGE!" and then it *worked.*

I mean all skills at lvl 4, having decent support skills etc. There are a lot of skills that should just have been included in the base character imo, but CCP designed the game in a way that you have to spend 3 months paying for omega to just get absolutely must-have skills. And then you need to start training into doctrine ships. There are several months before you can fly anything interesting. It would have been better for the game and player retention if these basic skills like the magic 14 and other similar skills were a part of the starter character.
