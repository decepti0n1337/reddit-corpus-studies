I do have all the resources... I have the best ship in the game... the friend ship.

Killboards prevent fights.

Next thing you will tell them their mommy lied when she told them "safe" and "fair" existed.

Then why does space feel so lonely?...

To everything,

 Turn.  Turn.

There is a season.    
---
 Turn.  Turn.   Turn.
---
I don't like the fact that the non Jita market hubs have been steadily contracting, much less the fact that there are thousands of stations with less than 500M active in their markets.   
---

---
People talk about the blue donut making the game stagnant, but what about all the hype about having the most interesting mmo economy anywhere?  Empty marketing.
---
&gt; would be a shame to this narrative if those hunters who were thriving were pretty much completely in favor of these changes, and showed support since the very start.
---
Would also be a shame if half the people who bitched about EVE on Reddit actually logged in.
---
But I feel pretty comfortable that the people who actually take pride in their work would rather have changes that actually substantively make the game more fun and not just turn nullsec into a shooting gallery.
---
It is CCP that is sharing that info. They generate the killmail (containing way too much info), and they provide the API to automate everything. CCP is the problem.
---
&gt;One of them has made a conscious choice to share those killmails with us.
---
Its not that simple, but even if it were, you forget one thing - the searchable profile. If everything was the same but you werent forced to have a fucking profile like facebook, things would be much better.
---
Cant find a nice pvp corp that accepts a returning player.
---
Minimum buy/sell order price change is 1 % of your original posted price. No more 0.01isk.
---
THIS. 
---
FUCKING THIS. 
---
MY GOD THE TEARS. IT WOULD BE GLORIOUS.
---
That skin should exist regardless.
---
I do low volume, high reward
---
BUT: You will always start with low isk, high volume, because you literally have no other option.  Having a market order fulfill is always a game if chance. At the start you can't buy the expensive stuff, and you work with to little orders to get anywhere with slow moving items.
---
I have around 300 buy orders. That allows me to have orders for things that might not get fulfilled in a week, or a month. But because I have a lot of those, SOME of them get fulfilled every day.
---
Starting out, you have a limited amount of market orders that you can do, an alpha can only do 17. Getting to 300 takes almost 4mil skillpoints, that takes time or 8 billion is XP.....
---
When you get more and more orders you will tend to find what works best for you, I found the stuff with a low volume to fit my playstyle, but I know people that make more isk with high quantity items.
---
Hope this was helpful. If you have questions, just post them here (I might forget to answer) or just write an in game mail to "Shani Amaris" (It might take some time for me to answer, but I usually do)
---
:) maybe they already have it
---
very very nice! i like it! =D
---
But subs in real life cannot light a beacon that other subs can jump to...  So there's a huge wall of risk vs reward no one seems to want to touch.
---
That’s the one that expires at DT on August 1st right? Good lad..!
---
No doubt.  The think we still fight main fleet battles with rorqs, using PANIC in open space...
---
I remember back when they were first released CCP was going to give us an option to choose which undock point subcaps leave out of. Nothing since.
---
Space is water, your ships are boyant
---
Upvoted. Another one has seen the light.
---
I'm shit at non fleet PvP and I'm not ashamed. Why should I be?
---
Unpowered citadels should be instant kill. No tether. Can't afford to run them all? You risk losing them
---
With just a minor spelling adjustment, 
---
We could use a gaydar
---
It’s as if there was a damage cap for a reason.
---
This is correct, a few events back they were cheaper than water.  I knocked back standards until the day before expiration and then drank an extended.  Would recommend.
---
Posting in a REEEEEE thread
---
Well, if you don't mind my very short unspectacular story then I will type it out for you.
---
I haven't been to lowsec in a long time (wormholer btw) and decided to do some DEDs since I like scanning and also got my tengu set and ready. 
---
As always I wasn't able to find a site right away but decided not to give up that fast and went further and further. Then finally I found a 6/10 DED after an hour or so (I've never done one of these before) and so I started working myself through.
---
In the last pocket I somewhat found my arch nemesis... missing dps... that boss bs repped faster than I could shoot. But with a lot of overheating and some clips of ammo I got him down. To be honest i didn't expect much from it since I almost never get anything good out of those sites BUT not this time. Whopping 700 mil were in there. 
---
I was very suprised and I guess also very lucky.
---
And to what I'm going to do with that money... well spend it on a better dps fit for my tengu. lol
---
So convenient having salt for my popcorn as I eat it whiling reading this post.
---
Holy shit, I never thought of that. I will for sure start doing that!
---
You're an idiot or a troll. I'll take idiot for 500, Alex.
---
Where it says source of protein, you missed the opportunity to add "not from biomass"
---
Will do, thank you!
---
You're an idiot and I am not the least bit surprised to see that you live in delve
---
Me and some corpmates decided to celebrate combat recons and went into a medium plex in FW space with all four of them plus a Moa. A deimos pilot landed out side the gate and thought "Yea! A lone moa to fight!" Needless to say he slid in and died in a ball of rage.
---
Everyone not playing waiting for the blackout to end, in the mean time indexes are falling and nothing it being built, but everything is running out of fuel.
---
So yeah, playing by myself is not fun.
---
Hell of a story :)! Congrats on the kill and the solid loot! Well deserved haha

LoL, great answer!

Lol.

These things don't mix well. Especially in such an environment.
---
Lmao, nah retard.
---
Also it's pretty clear you just wanted to exaggerate and say a carrier can alpha it. Just own up to it and be done mate.
---
I know your just angry right now because you got scammed. But beyond that, what is your objections to alphas? It gives people the chance to play for free, and gives the universe more population.
---
I'm a Krab and even I agree.
---
Sounds like it was over before it even began haha
---
Lmao, you also think caps can consistently apply to subcap, so I'm going to bet you're just as fucking retarded about these mechanics as well.
---
The game changed, skill yourself and get better or move on you fat fuck
---
EVE itself. Why it's not dead yet?
---
BRING BACK THE OLD NEMESIS 2KWHEN
---
I mean this respectfully
---
did you even read anything but the word “alpha”?

I understand this, but at the same time some like the bharghest are as big as a carrier, literally.

i mean this respectfully, but did you read anything other than the word “alpha”?

Don't forget Robin... I mean Falcon...

Worst duo ever.

No and make citas slowly decay during low power.
---
evading CONCORD is though

This.
---
I doubt it, many of the bots are running just fine, all the real players are what disappeared.
---
Or just have people able to jump into systems without a cyno. They appear at a random location around the star.
---
On August 31, 2010 I sacrificed Golden Wrench 31 in Team Fortress 2 to close out a 31 day fundraiser that raised $31,000 for Child's Play Charity.
---
&gt; If you made a program that is nothing but pointers, I guess. Is that even a program in any meaningful way?
---
You're starting to approach the concept of "worst case scenario".  Perhaps you should continue down that road.
---
&gt; Because you have to be "that guy"?
---
The guy who's trying to correct the guy claiming all 64-bit programs use double the memory?  Boy, that's a terrible place to be in.  Way worse than the guy who keeps desperately trying to not understand the phrase "up to".
---
I understand you probably don't like blackout, but don't lie.

Cobalt Edge had 4x botting Rattlesnakes in every pocket north of CUT-0V. How do I know they were bots? Their own fucking people said "yeah those are bots v0v." How do I know Period Basis was bots? I think hunting for nearly a decade in nullsec gives one a pretty good idea as to what seems likely a bot.
---
Also please tell me, where are the bots? They clearly aren't in nullsec anymore and that's a good thing.
---
No
---
I don’t object. to alphas, but the updates show a clear pattern of wanting them removed, but they are not shooting them, they are doing a global smart bomb.
---
Which is why asset safety is a good policy. It is enjoyed for all but the smallest subset of players.
---
Would expect a better post from Tuskers.
---
His reasons don’t make any sense to me. I was asking for what about alphas he disagrees with. They have no relevance to tax increase, and they aren’t the reason bots exist. He has posted multiple posts raging about EVE and said he was leaving. I’m just curious to find out why he is so upset so that maybe we can convince him otherwise, or help explain a knowledge gap.
---
and local was also enjoyed for all but "the smallest subset of players"
---
and its been taken away and is wildly spoken of as a success.
---
So you're point makes no sense. just because people want that safety net, doesn't mean its for the good of the game.
---
Alphas accounts are freeloaders
---
Shut up, Penif.
---
I’d be fine with losing my 200 plex if they at least fix the scam that made me lose it
---
Oh so your saying it’s too hard for alphas? I misunderstood. What about taxes hurts alphas worse? Or the market?
---
Short answer: You don't
---
This is the best solution. But I hear it mentioned so rarely on /r/eve.
---
You don't hurt established players by making it more difficult to become established. You hurt established players by reducing the benefits of being established.
---
Personally im just ovrr a year in the game. I wemt from being shit at pvp to on top our corp amd alliamce zkill
---
Yeah, that combined with cloaked campers would be the new space aids.
---
i don’t object to alphas, ccp has shown a pattern of wanting them gone. Think, increases on base tax, requiring omega skills to put it back to normal?
---
Are you an alpha player? And if not why not?
---
It isn't an exploit. Copies are not sold on the market. 
---
If you suspect someone of being a bot, but do not report them, YOU are part of the problem.
---
I mean the taxes directed at alphas to make them pay $ to effectively market trade takes a crap on omega too, that don’t have skills trained to V
---
Someone doesn't understand what a blue donut is.
---
I am omega that never bothered to train those skills because i didn’t market trade, but now i must wait 20 days to buy anything at a reasonable price and also jita is dead
---
Or creates them, depending on what type of person you are.
---
Sounds like someone is still salty about Rage.
---
And how is this supposed to support your arguments that building caps isn't too scalable and easy
---
People underestimate how nasty without proper logi how nasty procures can be
---
15au?  You want to be able to start an attack off grid, and cannot see why that is not good? 
---
But fighters attacking off-grid was so powerful it was nerfed...
---
Are you American? Republican? I understand if you are, republicans have a hilariously cartoonish response to any real or proposed tax increase no matter how small, it makes them paranoid that Stalin himself is going to rise up out of the stock exchange and throttle democracy.
---
I mean, sure, but not for _ratting_
---
i did, many times, stop throwing out accusations
---
This is how it worked for most of EVE's existence.
---
I’d rather RMT it and send the value to you in horse shit
---
Oh Cool,
---
I don’t disagree I wasn’t arguing that point? You just simply can’t take zkill away all together without people being pissed because it holds our history and achievements in pvp.... and also exactly from what you said makes eve unique and awesome! The fact that people can look up who you are and learn about your history is what makes people standout and makes eve standout in regards to pvp.
---
If you think taking the fight isnt the default.
---
But you're quoting tier 2 and 3 ships.  Capitals are tier 1 ships.
---
This could work if it was only on grid.
---
Look at that, the drone is salty!
---
Fuck off.
---
They have to actually have it to win it...  The other thing that was a bad decision this year. Cancelling AT.
---
where do you see automation there bud?
---
I say we go one step further than that: make there be some randomness like if you jump there is a 1 in 10000 chance you show up somewhere else like a C6 blackhole, null 50 jumps or or that you just blow up. How's that for risk?
---
Have to have a game similar to it before that can happen.   
---
When is some Korean company going to program that!?
---
They are much too powerful to share the same build resource pool as tier 1 subcaps.
---
&gt;You just simply can’t take zkill away all together without people being pissed because it holds our history and achievements in pvp....
---
They can keep what is, but no more auto updates, and remove profiles of those who dont want to be there.
---
&gt;The fact that people can look up who you are and learn about your history is what makes people standout and makes eve standout in regards to pvp.
---
The point was that in a game where you can lose your stuff if someone knows what you fly, it is dumb to let people have that info.
---
16 year old game
---
Many long term players
---
Many people have the biggest ship in the game

** Confused Pikachu **

Why do you need to look further as to why so many exist?
---
MY GOD. YOU DONT GET IT. A TAX INCREASE IRL MAKeS SENSE BECAUSE THEY NEED THAT MONEY TO FIX SHIT. THIS IS FAKE IN GAME MONEY. CCP CAN MAKE AS MUCH ISK AS THEY WANT. THEY ARE DUMPING ON EVERYONE, SHITING 360 DEGREES LIKE HIPPOS

A drone with a voice. Amazing. Go crab!

I don't krab.

Worst case scenario *in a real program*. You will NEVER, EVER in a real program use double the RAM. Not up to. Not even CLOSE. It is literally impossible. If registers were the entire memory footprint of your program, you'd use double memory. But then you wouldn't have a program.
---
&gt;The guy who's trying to correct the guy claiming all 64-bit programs use double the memory?
---
You mean me? You're the guy going ACKSHUALY and hiding behind "up to" to try and justify your ridiculous assertions of things will never happen. I understand what "up to" means, I just think your usage of it is horrendous and you're only using it because you need to be THAT GUY.

Because "Bees" keep pollinating it?  LoL

Fitting you want it to go "the way of the dinosaurs"

Yes, I find both those statements funny!

---
What’s your story? Why are you unable to play?
---
I know I said I don’t disagree with that part there definitely should be a 30 min delay but the person I replied to talk about getting rid of the kill-boards.... and yes it can be a double edge sword but fitting also isn’t everything and it’s worth it to show achievements. The fact that blackout hides your name from being searched in local unless they are gathering intel on gates is a huge advantage to hunters now and it’s awesome.
---
In the next part of 'Why Hilmar doesn't understand EvE players' ...
---
During the zkill/dotlan blackout, a major player group - Fraternity - built a zkill clone, so their coalition could get the information zkill had used to provide, presumably to help them defend their miners and ratters and plan offensive operations.
---
As long as your own kill- or death- information can be exported, coalitions (who all have the in-house IT capability of a medium-sized corporation) will build the tools to look through that fog-of-war.
---
Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.
---
Well. I've been fucking around in lowsec. Shooting people, having fun, no big deal. Made some friends, shot those friends. Today I attacked one of those friends, mind you I'm not blue to these people; we shoot the same people and fleet up sometimes, he was so mad that his Ospery Navy couldn't catch and kill my frigate and that I was breaking his tank he warpped in 3 alts and 2 of his other corp mates. I wasn't about to fight them all so I fucked off. They started trash talking me, accusing me of giving away Intel to a fleet I wasn't even on a few days ago. Bitching about attacking blues. It was ridiculous. They ended up saying they were resetting me and then decided to red pen and block me. I was just sitting there like "wtf is wrong with you people? LOL. We were never blue. No agreement ever made what are you idiots going on about?" I thought it was hilarious how mad they got. Needless to say I'll be going out of my way to hunt them now. Should be more good content for my guys with new reds in our space.

Also OP, you already posted already bitching about this. Please stop spamming

We should just remove all isk making from the game entirely and turn it into a BR.

Citadels,  The fact they are so aweful to kill no reward for doing so (dropped loot).
---
Also super capital proliferation the bigger groups drop them on everything no need for subs the supers and titans will kill everything.   This shouldnt be the case.

Also bombers in the blackout,  there is very little to counter bomber fleets appearing nuking something and vanishing.

It wasn't a glitch. Literally the item tells you it is a copy. Get fucked.

The post OP made 5 minutes before this. I suspect that may be the cause of his frustration with this game.
---
Really? I honestly made 99% of that ISK doing exploration. Which was like 15/20% of my total game time to date. I been mostly fitting out some of the starter ships for fleet fun and to learn the ropes. 
---
I just run relic sites and within an hour I can come back to home base with 100-500million. Depending on luck of course. Sometimes I can run for an hour and almost hit nothing.

Back in the day, the vision was to use PI base design and layout as terrain for fighting in DUST 514, modifiable by people that did PI. Ofc, that never panned out because of the ridiculous scope and implications.. but it was a really interesting idea at the time.

Maybe you should check FRAT space...  Find them there just fine, both before and after the blackout...  maybe you're just a bad hunter?

I somewhat doubt you're a big time market trader who is hit big by the taxation changes considering you made a post about getting scammed for 200 plex and 100mil by a BPC scam.

I don't know if it was my life, I'd want to extend it as long as I could...

Glad i chose a similar path ( i honestly just want to pilot an astero). I’m just waiting on the luck part.

They can just auto assign Drones to the commander and then /afk out ... no broadcasting required!
---
Commander presses F1 and all Drones follow lead.
---
*I know everyone here understands that but since there are allways some retards who call "third party tools" on simple game mechanics I felt the need to express that!*
---
&gt; BPC ARE BLUEPRINT
---
I mean, that's not wrong.
---
i’m advocation for others too
---
The way you worded it made it sound like you thought shooting CONCORD was the bannable part, not evading/surviving.
---
But yes you are right, surviving CONCORDOKKEN by any means gets you the ban hammer.
---
100+ standby...what? I did not say “remove cynos”
---
I said make them have to warp at least once to land on the combat grid. Drag bubbles are exactly the point of what I said. You better damn well make sure that your subcaps own the target grid bubble-wise or your caps are gonna have a rough day. 
---
If the enemy brings dreads, bubble drag them back. This goes two ways, ya know?
---
I've went solo bombing some days...  that is super fun.
---
I'll wait for one of those "others" to make a meaningful post about the impact of the taxation changes then.
---
 This change is primarily directed against the bots of traders. Are you a bot trader? Something tells me that yes.
---
Even WITH proper logi. I got hit by a 25man kiki gang the other night. Almost got 5 of the kiki's. The Hero logi was on the ball. They only killed one procurer before they fucked off, but they did the correct thing and defanged me as fast as they could.
---
Tell me one good thing the tax changes did
---
Nah, fuck your cyno. Fuck all cynos. Fuck cynos. 
---
Not salty at all.
---
I live in NullSec as part of PL so I contract all my exploration loot to one of our contractors for 97% value. As taken it to Jita myself would be to much of a risk. 
---
Funny story, I got my Astro a few nights ago. Was so pumped! Spent a little over 100m then went into a WH, and got popped by 2 other Astros and that T3 Tangue (what ever it’s called). Was funny but sad at the same time. So I bought it again but now I’m to scared to use it haha, as our Corp gives out the nooby exploration ships for free. I’ll wait till I get a bit more better at the PVP stuff before I take her out again.
---
and i’ll gild you
---
Great to replace an useless mechanic with another more supressive one.
---
Nice balance!

Hope CCP figures this shit out and does no 1week patch cycles like Riot games to combat this bullshit.

Earlier today he was scammed out of some plex and isk by a jita contract because I guess he thought he was buying a bpo because when he clicked view market details it brings up the bpo since bpc’s aren’t on market.
---
Since then he’s been spamming r/eve
---
I’ve been playing just under a week. Nothing I’m doing is noteworthy or exciting. :)
---
I did run into one of those Triglavian guys while doing a Sisters Of EVE mission today, and I killed him. That may not sound like much of an accomplishment, but when you suck as much as I do, you take what you can get. 😛
---
You know technically the code for this is in place already, they have a DEV module called "Recon System Scanner" that lets them warp towards an object with gravitational mass.
---
What if we had this but then had to hunt around the area we landed to decloak the ship.  
---
Some will say no, but have you ever tried to decloak a ship?  it's not super easy, requires a lot of luck whether you do it with drones or a smartbomb.
---
yes but if they are not on market, it shouldn’t tell you it’s 100x more valuable that the fuck shit it is
---
that shut you up huh
---
i suggest you buttfuck your idiots ajfnwkc
---
I had no idea what contracting was! I’ll have to read up on it! 
---
Yikes, that’s my biggest fear, sucks to loose such an amazing ship that quickly but glad you could recoup it, guess you just gotta hang tight a little bit before it’s ready to undock again
---
Awww a new player. 
---
When skins were introduced any skin could be used on any ship.
---
ah OK, that makes a little more sense. Thanks
---
The community. 80% of them seem like entitled fucks. Something exciting is happening in the game and it's just accusations and name calling. Talking shit about specific staff and such.

This sub is worse than /r/rickandmorty and that's saying something.

You look dumb as heck

You'd be doing the NPC challenge regardless, so seems weird to add that to the SP from the injector.

I once put 6 of my characters into horde and then tackled horde and gotg rorqs with my horde rorqs and procurers. Baited horde response and killed a shit ton of horde caps was good fun. Panic makes procurers invincible tackling ships with 4 points :POG:
---
Hey I think that’s a huge accomplishment! It sounds like you’re making solid headway into The Sisters missions already!
---
^ would be easier if you had sustainable isk and not having to replenish for a while before being able to replace a ship haha
---
Yeah, honestly if you don’t know that there are copies and originals then it is, indeed, confusing. I probably would have fallen for a scam like that when I started last year. My only scam so far is I lost a billion isk on a scam where a guy has a market buy order up so high that he doesn’t have the isk to cover, so that a few jumps away I would buy his still overpriced officer mod hoping to turn a quick profit by selling it to this other order. But when I tried to sell it the order drops because he doesn’t have the isk. I was pretty upset as well. They’re some pretty clever folks those scammers.
---
huh?
---
Everyone already fits a cyno. Why would it matter?
---
Salt is on sale it seems.
---
for frigates, often resistances aren't that great so resistances really don't mitigate nearly as much of the incoming dps as they do for HACs or BS so you need frigate logi to pop out like 1000 hp/s

It acts as a isk sink. Thats all it need to be

 Welcome to the club "Salty Rain"  =D
---
I don't see how this is a bad thing.  That's a risk of putting up goods to avoid NPC taxes.
---
It’s a way to get isk out of the game otherwise the value of the ingame currency decreases.
---
YOU DID NOT SEE GRAPHITE!
---
fuck policits
---
Heh yeah. Biggest rule in Elite Dangerous was never fly what you can’t afford to replace. So it carried over perfectly to this game :D
---
It's a big killmail, that's all that matters. You'll get decced as soon as they see you don't have friends to come save you. You might last a long time, you might get found out in a week.

ftr. i have 800 plex left and 700 m isk  and 4.5b of ships and items, cocksucker
---
The balence is supers
---
People used to do deployments in POSes.  That has no damage caps, no docking, etc.
---
I like 6; 19; and 20...
---
^^^ can you explain this a bit more to someone not entirely familiar with the Eve lingo?
---
please abstain from society
---
lolol growtopia never got rid of currency and items are getting move valuable
---
you get scammed a minimal amount and are raging like a lunatic.
---
calm the fuck down.
---
I'm just coming back to the game from about 4 year hiatus.  
---
asset safety is a wired concept.  What I loved about this mmo as opposed to any other was the complexity but also the reality of loosing your stuff when you die.  
---
its brutal, it creates real feelings of loss and something that inspires the feeling of risk.  I liked the always PvP mechanic too.  
---
having this asset safety dilutes that stand out feature, for me anyway, of real loss.  
---
Black out in Null is great.
---
They dont put it back to normal. They reduce the impact, sure. But theres still a significant increase.
---
if it’s a “minimal amount” give it to me
---
Would be cool to see more of a blend between the two games! They are both solid games on their own but it would be crazy so see a tied together combination
---
bruh moment
---
I’m not here to troll or grr goons, but do goons even form subcaps to fight people?  I thought the policy was America levels of overwhelming force by dropping supers on anything they find.  That reputation is probably why hunters take off quickly.
---
Please come in for scram Range... I want you that close, also know where the kill marks are on the Domi, if guys would have seen this they would have fucked off to a different target.
---
so you can lose it to another retarded scam? 
---
just because i can does not mean i'm going to enable your idiocy.
---
I hope you are a grown man, cause a grown man throwing a temper tantrum would sure make my day right now.
---
ffs dont make posts like this, dont make those numbers public
---
Sent you 10b, stop crying.
---
If you would have clicked on Show Info it would have told you it was a copy.
---
there isn't a bug you are just a moron.
---
&gt; I’m sorry you’re lazy and your target groups aren’t I guess. 
---
This is ultimately what it comes down to. I'm 100% in favor of more supers dying, but when the only suggestions are "nerf the ability of the defenders to organize", it's hard to take them seriously. Like, get good. Supers die all the time even under umbrellas. One died the other day in delve because a group got creative instead of just bitching on reddit about muh super umbrella.
---
I can't speak for all of GSF, but I can at least vouch that my corp more often forms subcaps, especially for last second hunter chasing.
---
Thanks, I wasn't sure what would happen.

The maddest dude on reddit award goes to you, my man. Get good.

...Yesterday...Just after dinner and before second beer..."Ding-ding" from phone...The sound of a possible kill...  
---
Me...running to PC...logging in...eye on phone discord : #polarizedbombersASAP!!  
---
Time for fun!  
---
When in game &amp; comms - FC already was screaming : "Undock basterdz, only 1 bridge and who miss - no kill for him...  
---
I undocked, BLOPS already fire the bridge...ckick...and WOOFFF...in other system, 20 jumps away... (cloak!)  
---
The situation:  We have 13 polarized bombers (means \~ 13k DPS overheated if you wandering why polarized), there was 4 rorquals on asteroide cluster and one carrier cloaked 250km from them and cleaning rats who spawns to rorqas...  
---
The plan:  We wait @20 from carrier spot cloaked, rats coming to rorqas, he decloak, sending fighters 250 km away and we show ourselves and point him...2 bombers warping around rorqas, start harassing them and instead of coming to safe carrier's ass with reps they'll warpout and we vapor the carrier with 50-60% heated launchers...  
---
The consequences:  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78109423/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78109423/)   \&gt; launchers burnt 45%, rorqas warped out as planned, only one sieged left on field to watch how Niddy dies, kikimora and tornado came to field just after poor carrier vapored and looted...  
---
5 min later wife aggro: "dicking time, kids sleeping, honey!" &gt;&gt; me as lightning: jumping trought blakops, docking, alt+F4 , "bye guys cya tmrw...", comms mutted...  
---
I'll stop here with my story...Things went too private and out of EVE after "comms mutted" thing...
---
If the in game map gets reworked I would absolutely love a toggle option that displays the map in a form like on Dotlan so it’s easy to read connections.  If I’m just free roaming around a region, I have dotlan open to guide me because the in game map is a spaghetti mess to read.

---
You kind of miss the point of doing any of this in the first place. If you get groups to spread out, both in terms of geography and politically in game you created opportunities for the smaller groups to challenge the subdivided bloc. Is this full proof, no. It does however create more barriers that larger groups have to overcome in order to remain dominant. 
---
Anything that is applied to a system can also be applied to a group. An alliance has a boat load of wealth, okay send the NPCs to invade their space/RF their structures. It isn't that big of a step to create a controller ai that works out what groups are working together. If CCP want to go the route of using NPCs to check players building to big of a castle then this is more than doable. This will never be done, not because it is not effective, but because it isn't "fair."
---
This explains a lot.
---
Where?
---
karmafleet, just karmafleet, not the entirety of goons or imperium, just karmafleet mines enough ore in 3 hours to build a titan. there are t2 rigged indy station everywhere that can build supers and titans. whatever bottleneck you are talking about doesnt exist.
---
They are re-thinking that - Seems to be evidence we had our shit together a lot longer than 12k years ago.

---
Low powered structures shouldn't have tethering and they should have EXTREMELY minimal reinforce timers if any at all. If it's in low power it deserves to die if attacked outright.
---
Should have kept mining for ultimate bm
---
Strongly agree, low power should have ZERO reinforcing and should just die.

Makes me think of Homeworld

I agree so much
---
Agree...generally seems like so many people nowdays are incredibly afraid of commiting ships to a fight even tho that's the whole point.
---
Battleship or above for heavy scrams.
---
A capital that doesn't have a cyno fit 24/7 is doing it wrong.
---
Dude, do you think people are stupid? You think people would go into hostile territory and not bring 20 cynos instead of one? All this change would do is make the game more tedious. And honestly, there isnt an issue with cynos. You know what issues there are though? HS being shit causing retention numbers to stay low, LS being rather shit and therefore unattractive to a lot of players. Warfare in NS being crap which makes everything stale.
---
So no, its not a cyno issue, nor is it asset safety or the super umbrella. And small gangs need to honestly just stick to their own things and stop crying over something that is balanced for big gangs.
---
Nice one, comparing the economy in a mobile game for kids versus EVE, in which most items in the game come from players. An economy like that needs sinks.
---
A reason why stuff get more valuable in your shitty game is due to inflation, which you see in most game today anyways. You'll become familiar with this as you grow up.
---
Who said I ever stopped mining? Only the drone bunny stopped so I didn't tackle a roid.
---
This is what a “garbage” email account is for. I’d never use my email that I use for my games on anything other then that games main site.
---
get gud use kitey ships for sieges
---
I disagree with Cyno's being an issue. Cyno's have gone unchanged for almost the entire time of eve. They've had small things like Titan's can't DD thru them anymore, but for the most part. Cyno's haven't undergone much change since they were introduced. 
---
If the previous generations didn't think they were an issue back when Superfleets used to go on a evening stroll half way across the galaxy to kill a vexor, they aren't a issue now.

This would be insanely helpful

That be cool.  Especially if the person in the other system..does not get to know which cyno is the right one.  Would give some defence and some risk.

Does the black screen go away after a minute? It could be a very long loading time due to your poor internet. For citadels, there's an option to look outside when docked, and you can make that the default. I don't think that'll help you with with stations, unfortunately.
---
Honestly if you can’t tell a bpc from the original, nor use other programs and websites such as evepraisal, evemarketer, public spreadsheets and eve university. Then industry maybe isn’t your game. If it wasn’t for the reeee factor you have going I’d say eve isn’t your game either.
---
You do this before he jumps silly.
---
Awww goddamn it.
---
If your keepstar is in known space (highsec, lowsec, nullsec) then your assets will automatically go into asset safety when the structure blows up. If your keepstar is in a wormhole, then you don't have asset safety at all.
---
Sounds like you fucked up. Cheer up, next time you'll fuck up even better and itll even out.
---
Not 100% true, but the pod-killing NPCs are few and far between and I don't think the OP will run into them.
---
Anybody remember lottery guy who burned his fucking house down and had it rebuilt with a floor drain so he didn't have to dock or safe to take a piss?
---
If it's any consolation, this was my station a few years ago:  [https://i.imgur.com/jcKOAxo.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/jcKOAxo.jpg)

Not normal.  Not unique either.  That said, this is the biggest event of this type (from on SP give perspective) that I have seen.

Hey whoa whoa there guy we dont need to bring the hippos into this they are an important demographic we will need in the next election cycle

I totally forgot, there used to be a limited number of production lines in stations and POS’s.  Now its system index that’s supposed to be the limiting factor?

No. Nor should low power structures have 11 day final timers either. The system is broke af.
---
There was something about the engine animations not being able to move relative to each other, and the devs were disappointed too iirc.
---
Just FYI, by stating where your putting said station, you'll probably lose it really quickly as people know your a solo fighter now.
---
The word wiener makes them sound so childish. I prefer a big manly cock myself.

Hi, watched you for many years for your civilization content and you exposed me to the fun of rim worlds. Haven’t been watching the last year or so, but I really enjoy your content.
---
I figure you know waaaay better than me, but I’d be remised if I didn’t request a STRONG focus on setting your own goals in this game and enjoy the experience rather than just trying to get in the baddest ship or whatever.
---
I think an entire video on just this topic would be worthwhile really. There’s no victory conditions in eve and it can be really difficult to learn to use your own imagination sometimes. I can’t say I’ve ever played a game like eve in that regard.
---
You have a strong audience and a chance to tee off many new players with a perspective that might help them get past that first learning curve. 
---
I realize it’s just a tutorial series at the moment but I’m hoping you stick around for a bit providing content. You have an excellent talent for explaining things quickly and with precision.

I hope this message finds you well. I’m hoping I don’t sound like a prick telling you what to do, just hoping for much success for you!!

Stop saying 24/7 AFK cloaking is a problem. They are fucking AFK. ZERO THREAT.
---
How will you be able to do this on a system by system basis. Afaik the endpoints that would need changing are not system specific  but game wide.
---
Exactly. Too easy mechanics will make players soft.
---
You just need several FC's in different systems. Null players will eventually adapt and learn to fight. You have had too easy gameplay for years and grown too soft &amp; weak. This will force players to learn how to play better.
---
I find 1v1's bit boring often. I enjoy fighting big groups solo :)
---
It is a "fuck, should I fit this or not?" module. We need more of that. Like the old days. When fleets were fleets not prescriptions.
---
OP's behaviour on r/eve isn't appropriate. I felt sorry for OP until they made their second thread about it. 
---
But the original issue that caused scam, and their subsequent *tanty* is a case of the UI lying to the user. 
---
Right clicking on a Blueprint *Copy* and selecting View Market Detail will actually bring the market page for the Blueprint *Original*. They *are* different items. Similar, yes. Different, also yes. The simplest solution would be to just remove the View Market Detail option on BPCs, and it should be put into Karkur's Little Things thread for interface changes (I would, but fuck the corporate network).
---
is this real or the eve equivalent of marilyn manson removing his ribs to suck his own dick
---
You cyno into regions and cloak now totally undetected and hide until you see a target, uncloak, kill and cloak up again.  And you still tear up because we make it hard for you to just simply hide all day and pop out when convenient....  
---
What a joke.
---
I don't think anyone is advocating for one subcap to trump a carrier.
---
I am pretty sure it's real.
---
Yeah and you usually only have to get like 60km out, most aren't aligned either because they are freaking out.
---
# WHAT?
---
I must know more.
---
This. The answer has always been there. It even comes with a covops  cloak. 
---
Locking down 1 carrier is not difficult. And it should not be possible to keep a cynojammer online on grid with anything more than that.
---
What is this? I’m interested... and just return to eve
---
Dude was talking about it in Celestial Imperative alliance comms many years ago, like 2012 or so? Wish I recorded it in retrospect. Was from Texas. Burnt his first house down after installing fryers.
---
No, it’s a shitty new trend since CCP got bought out and needs to milk EvE for all its worth.
---
this would be heniously broken in a fleet situation. 
---
MAYBE a targeted script on hictors to cynojam. 
---
Definitely nothing AOE that could be spammed on the grid of a fleet fight and just nullify any kind of escalation in a capital fight.
---
As a newbie I have enjoyed it so I can train into gear I need faster lol
---
All this would do is kill people hunting using dreads. AKA super's would be wayyy safer ratting. OP is bad and should feel bad.
---
they tried a very big experiment (removal of local in null) and to not tank login numbers even more than usually in summer, they decided to give our SPs
---
Depends on how much you want to spend. Though mostly EVE is CPU/RAM bound.
---
Try and get yourself at least 1 thread per account and at least 32GB of RAM (I run 15 accounts on a 6C/12T and use roughly 20-25GB of Ram with EVE alone).
---
GPU something decent/cheap will do. 2060 or 1070.
---
Me too!
---
Hiiiiii mum!
---
Man, blackout making Tuskers salty...
---
Maybe if it was a targeted cyno inhib. How does nobody see how the ability to spam AOE cynoinhib effects is not going to work out? One drop and suddenly there is no escalation chain. Whoever happens to get the first cyno on a grid has complete control because they are the only ones who can bring in caps.
---
Hey urinator, suck dick
---
Exactly i need ccp to give me my #### back and fix the scam
---
It isnt lonely. Thats the issue
---
Whilst i agree cynos need fixing, this isnt it.
---
What you are asking for is a mechanic that is easily by-passable (multiple cynos on grid) for what end? 
---
Sadly if your idea were to work, and some how secondary cynos could be denied, then you are denying a large number of people from jumping to the content. Denying players content isnt the fix to cynos.
---
Additionally imagine the retardatuon of larhe move ops under your idea. It would just be painful.
---
imagine you buttfucking your mom in blood, duchbag
---
Being one of the reasons behind this post is actually a positive in my book.
---
Looking back, when the history books are written on Eve Online and when the servers shut down, you'll be able to see on a chart that even the last flailing attempts by CCP to save a dying game failed. https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility Click the player averages at the top for each period - 1 month, 3 months, 1yr, 5yrs and all. This is a company that repeatedly didn't listen to its player base, doesn't understand their own game mechanics or balance and a CEO whose has now become completely unhinged in a desperate attempt to throw spaghetti against the wall and hope something sticks. CCP would have better averages going to the next Eve Vegas and playing Blackjack with all that's left in their wallet.

FIghter can be shot to lower that 16k and it's only 16k if it has volley available. 
---
A 3 FSU II 4 faction DDA Nidhoggur still takes close to a minute to kill the inhib if you rep it for a total of 0 hp so your example carrier would take even more time giving you a decent window to lower his DPS within more manageable range.

So, I see the Pacifier, Enforcer, and Marshal are all listed as "Special Edition" ships.  Does this mean there won't be any more after this round of project discovery?  Like, people will buy skins for these ships and if the ships are gone then tough?  
---
Or is there a plan to make them more regular ships in the game.  ('Cause I really like the Black Troop skins but don't want to waste the isk; super expensive.)
---
People keep bitching about the too large number of structure in space and you want to add another layer of reason to deploy more?
---
You first.
---

---
Its strange because the playerbase was complaining the game was too safe and played out. Now CCP has plans to drastically shake things up, which is literally what the experienced player-base asked for.

Log a Bug Report in game (press F12, and it's in one of the menus there). Bug Reports are for fixing defects in code. Fixing defects prevents things from happening again in the future. They are *not* for reparations. A Bug Report is not the right place to go if you want some kind of compensation. 
---
If you want that, then you should log a Support Ticket with the GM team. The GM team hasn't done anything mean to you, so they do not deserve any of your hostility. 
---
So when you write the Ticket; *be polite*. 
---
Your first sentence should be;
---
&gt;I got scammed. I understand scamming is part of the game, but in this specific case it was caused by Eve's interface giving me misleading information. 
---
Then explain in chronological order every step that happened. Don't jump around; that's confusing. And take the time to use proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation. You don't need to use fancy words. You only need to be easy to understand. 
---
If you want the ISK+Plex refunded, clearly ask for that at the end. If you want your subscription cancelled, and money returns, clearly ask for that at the end. 
---
Just remember, scamming **is** part of Eve. There's a strong chance that the rules the GM's follow *forces* them to decline your request. I do believe in your case that sucks. But just don't be a dick if that happens.

*Why* are people bitching about the number of structures in space? It's because they're a pain to shoot down. The number itself isn't the problem; it's a symptom of the underlying problem.

I've waited about 10 min before, so maybe it is the internet connection? Thanks for the suggestion and for now I'll just live with it until I get a better connection.

yeah i agree 100% that supers being able to dock was a mistake from the v start, but once they remove poses i think they should be able to tether on every size of citadel imo

Tin foil: CCP wants you to perms burn Jita so the other trade hubs can get some love...

---
"was online" when? WHen it went low power or when I put the stuff in this citadel 3 moth ago just before taking a break from EVE? Remember that asset safety, while certainly used in not so intended way quite foten, is also there to make sure returning EVE players have their stuff available to them in one way or another when they decide to come back to the game in the same vein as it was with outpost.

You k?

I don't mine, rat or pve. Follow the logic, because the old timers who've actually play this game for years have already said it, only to be shouted down. The 'little guys' screaming to fuck nullsec don't get it yet. All CCP did was assure both Imperium, Legacy, Panfam/FRT and those who collected their empires wisely will turtle up under supercap umbrellas and roaming gangs will cry more about having supers dropped on their heads and being bosooned on gates by titans. Human nature is human nature. You can't stop a 'collective' from gathering together for safety. It's what humans do. We got our titans and supers and so do Goons and every other big block. Good luck getting yours, because the very second you look like your small alliance wants space and drops a Sotiyo, we're gonna Dumpster on you.

# i said this  I've already cancelled my subscription, as I don't see anything happening. I got scammed 200 plex and 100m worth of other stuff because the "view market details" was broken and sent me to the original blueprint screen and said the price of the blueprint was 2b for each obelisk blueprint, as well as others. I traded 200 plex and a bunch of other stuff for it, using the right-click and view market details, not any resources the scammer gave me. This is a big exploit and can be used to scam new players like me. I was given many orca blueprint copies, and 3 obelisk BPCs, as well as others, for 200plex and 100m worth of other stuff. I would like the trade reversed, if possible, and then i will resubscribe.

Thats about even.
---
Small groups will most of the time always lose to larger groups in eve. That is inevitable and besides the point. What no local does is actually punish extremely large groups by essentially creating a sort of diminishing returns system where it becomes increasingly harder to manage everything going on in your space. The only reason as you have pointed out is the true strength of these mass null blocs now is their ability to flex super capitals that can deal with any situation.
---
With the inevitable mass nerf to supers dealing with subcaps EVE will see a greater age of smaller groups. 
---
I suspect larget blob members sense this and hence the blind screeching of baballing bands of baboons proclaiming Eve is near the end. When in actual fact it seems to be in a paradigm shift for good.
---
Just a silly little thing I thought I'd throw together in a few minutes. For the record, I have no position really on the new taxes, and this is not to be interpreted as either support for or condemnation of EVE's new taxes. I just figured I'd share this little thing.
---
The point still stands. 12,000 years ago we were just starting on getting things together in a large way. 15,000 years is long enough for even the most hardened redundant computer system to fail.

Did you corp get swiped from under you? Assuming you were in control of Solutions Inc.
---
Okay. But what you're talking about is CCP's most recent changes, and you're asserting that this is destroying the game. And as evidence you use the PCU. But PCU doesn't mean shit. A game can have a great PCU and still be completely devoid of content. What is important is DAU and MAU, and according to CCP (and granted, I don't disagree that they should release their numbers and how they get them for the sake of transparency) these have been increasing. Looking at Zkill activity it's hard to disagree.
---
The game lost accounts in the short term, sure, but most of these were largely inactive, AFK, and/or botting accounts that didn't contribute positively to the content in the game and in fact severely negatively impacted it by damaging the market and driving away active players. Now that they're gone we're already seeing a smaller, healthier playerbase that's more engaged, and this coupled with ongoing changes meant to ease in new players and improve the 30-day and 90-day retention rates will see EVE grow and become much healthier of a game.
---
This period will be remembered as a short dip in an otherwise healthy userbase. EVE has been through worse and it has endured. After all, you're giving it a lot of shit here and yet you're still playing, are you not?
---
Having no local does NOT punish large bloc alliances, and that's the rub. We have the best intel networks and IT services in Eve. We've already adapted to no local just fine, and the funny part is the Rorqual, supers saves have actually dropped. It's spooky in here with supers and titans on gates with one Discord ping away from 50 more. We adapted already. Did you?

I need to add one extra key piece of advice; you need to focus on the `Right-Click &gt; View Market Details` part. The items scammed are not important. The *value* of the items are not important. 
---
The. Single. Most. Important. Thing. Is that the Eve client told you about a *different* item than the one you clicked on. Focus on this part. Point out that it is confusing, and unfair, and inconsistent with every other type of market item.

Cool, what speed are you paying for with your ISP? If ~47mbps is a lot lower, then your network connection might be throwing a wrench in things, but the game proper and reddit would have the same problems.

I never said the recent changes are destroying the game. I'm loving no local. I am asserting that you can't even measure a short-term blip, but that it's a series of mistakes over time (that have been discussed over and over here) that remain unfixed. 'Chaos' doesn't fix the issues; kit masks them temporarily. CCP has a terrible track record on 'fixing' their game and long-term charting proves that ... big picture. Not to mention that even a small spike at a time when CCP did three-month sub alt SP giveaways, free SP for killing a fookin' rat in space, 15% off plex (at a time when Plex dropped 15% on the market btw) skews any data they have to prove anything. I liked the writers analysis here. Have a read. He's right. https://imperium.news/why-the-nullsec-blackout-wont-fix-eve/ ...

You can set keybind in the program to swap clients instantly. I have not noticed any input lag going from 1 client to the next that way

Hmm...to be honest our corp activity been consistent the past months. But yesterday we caught 2 rorq (1 Init, 1 Bast) mining in Outer Ring. It seems that some nullbears think they can mine safely in dead regions because of the blackout :D

We also been checking wh more that usual for sure!

Yeah most of us were like “what is this site, been playing 11 years and never been in one” and then it was all “I have tackle, dude is melting “ and the. Someone else was all like “hold dps for the fuqboi stragglers “ and then we were all “.........” and then grath like “recruit that dude to waffles because he just jihaded is mother fuckin Loki into a mother fuckin bomb in the site and deleted your bitch asses! How does it feel to get that ass Eaten out???? “ he then proceeded to laugh obnoxiously and ping discord with our losses to put our shame on full display.

Low # of players during summer, so game companies give a lot of freebies as incentives.

Oh Grath.
---
47 is pretty solid and I don't think it's the ISP. Of course I wouldn't have any way to be certain but we've never had these problems before. 
---
No problems with any other website whatsoever(for example, warframe's website loads fine). It seems to just be the websites that are xxx.eveonline.com, but anything that's eveonline.com/xxx works (eg https://www.eveonline.com/now/invasion).
---
I have no idea what a dns is. I was able to access the account through a web proxy, but that doesn't let me log in. 
---
I guess this isn't really a problem with EVE, but it does seem weird that nothing else is being affected.
---
Or, you can skip the the keybinds, by having all three clients on-screen natively and just click the things.
---
I built 4 jump freighters about 9 months ago and owned the whole chain of bpo’s. With optimal set-up, and a max reprocessing character, and using 1d1 mineral prices and processed reaction prices, a jf cost 7bil isk to manufacture after all costs were charted. But it was a pretty decent sized spreadsheet and cost a few hundred mil more isk to deliever.
---
We've got loads of previously bitter vets, now we've got them actually enjoying the game again!
---
&gt; With the inevitable mass nerf to supers dealing with subcaps EVE will see a greater age of smaller groups.

---
Chipper Charlie over here 👈
---
Are you for or against the nerfing of super capitals against suncaps?
---
And change the rendering into a more cartoonish style, the ships into cute dancing anime characters, and add destroyable terrain instead of all this space so we can actually walk around and shoot each other in the face up close and personal. Maybe some sort of rapid tower building element, idk.
---
And of course rebrand it to attract new players. Maybe name it after the time period it will take all the old players to leave in disgust. I'd give that about a fortnight or so.
---
Congrats to your CEO for being able to handle you weebs &lt;3
---
This is something I'd love to see. Alongside removing tethering for subcaps and make citadel guns only work if the structure is being RFed. Tether on fuels stations still allows for you to get a cap safe (aside from bumping), but now you can bubble and camp citadels like you can NPC stations. It also means you can camp jump gates without having to fight a fort/keep at the same time.
---
42 characters, 458 kills right here :)
---
You have my vouch.
---
I'll say it again blackout has never stopped anyone pvping ever...the players did
---
Imagine living in lowsec in 2019 and not just being a newbie Corp
---
Handle is a strong word...more like delegates whilst on vacation and posting picturesque photos of awesome locations on discord
---
Nullbears mining in dead regions is actually a good thing though
---
You guys have always been fun. It's good to see corp pride.
---
Needs more fire
---
Just use one of the npc or established low sec markets. Its gonna take forever to even recoup the cost of a fitted azbel in taxes if you are just a little peon.
---
Dude that’s awesome! I’m still kind of a noob so I can’t come close to affording that yet, but I would have never come up with that by myself. You’re awesome.
---
Wait ratters are still using vni's? But but the rebalance!
---
When will you return
---
Prefer good subcap brawls. Caps are F1. I just don't think CCP will drop that hammer. If they do, they'll see mass unsubs at a time they really can't afford it.
---
It’s good to see dead terrorist is active again, was surprised to see them when they helped us kill some capitals the other day.
---
Waffles is a PL alt corp anyway.
---
Last time I checked, FAX and dreads did not run when in siege
---
&gt; they fly spaceships like they haven’t done it since ‘Nam
---
I believe you. Especially after that one time they forgot how to broadcast. That was fun.
---
It’s just made it more spontaneous, and gave smaller groups the ability to pick engagements without getting dropped turbo dunked en route (mostly) or getting not scanned into an intel channel 6 jumps from target (mostly)
---
It basically forces larger groups to have multiple fleets on standby if you are going to protect your billions of isk generating operations going in more than one spot. Goons are exceedingly good at this by the by.
---
We forced them to drop supers to protect 3 rorqs, the. Warped to a different rorq that was alone and forced them to drop again (different supers) and then did it 3 more times in the span of 10 minutes. We were trying to be elite and run them out of support, then either A)  kill someone they had to leave to protect another group or B) go to target #6 when they were out. By the 5th time they were dropping 2 fax and a titan solo because they ran out of support. Miraculously other targets docked up because apparently they communicate and said something along the lines of “no support, dock your shit”
---
Anyways I digress, what were we talking about?
---
I think it would cause far too much confusion tbh.  But I agree if it's in low power then perhaps tethering shouldnt  be available. You can at least know if tethering is on by knowing the station is in low power mode.
---

---
Well, apart from covert cynos... that can make one cloaky ship turn into a fleet that will tear apart capitals, supers and even titans...
---
If you're not on the docking ACL, you don't get tether. Or has that changed?
---
I don't see how it's any more or less confusing than not being able to dock.
---
Uh their ratting has drastically decreased too, but they also have some real people, unless bots fight wars now too?
---
Citadels are far far  too cheap.  How can a massive space station be the same price as a decent fit T3.  
---
Too easy to build, too quick to anchor.
---
This needs a serious change
---
Eg
---
Astra = 20b
---
Fort = 100b
---
Keep = 700b
---
I know these number look big but look.at what youre getting.  A fully equipped space station!! They shouldnt be something you can just dropped down for 900m isk.  That's just ridiculous.
---
They should take much longer to build and longer to anchor.  Having one of these should be a huge  sense of achievement.  Eve has lost is awe factor.
---
Others already mentioned drone assisting - this is also why these people usually run NRFs while in HQ system. Its a 1 room site, so you only have to setup once, the waves and whats going to happen is very stable and predictable.
---
You can download the eve launcher from the eve website independently of steam, which would fix the issue, but I'm not sure if that would also require a complete reinstall of game files along with the new launcher.
---
^^ he gets it.
---
I only play 2 accounts in null, and sometimes when i get bored i have 2 accounts in hisec for missions and other stuff like diving into WHs , gank people or steal stuff if i find.
---
I wanted to build my own super, so i started. I am not a huge mining fan, but i needed the minerals. With 1 Rorq and i exhumer on field + boosts, it took forever to mine the minerals needed. I ended up paying 2 bil on contracts to someone to get the rest + mexallon which is heavily needed.
---
Ended up mining for 2 months , casually not 24/7 and another 17 days of build time. This was for a Nyx. Only hull, i still have it and it's not fully fitted.
---
Is Hilmar the new Karen?
---
you wont get my resub but shutup and take this upvote
---
Small change? This was literally one of the biggest changes since the servers went up
---
remember clone upgrades? judging on how hilmar thinks i cant wait for him to propose something worse than that
---
Was that one of the superior sleeper caches or something?
---
No of course not....
---
Its not the size of the change.....
---
Its how you use it.
---
You're absolutely right for an 'active' pvp group then blackout has helped especially with losing Intel or significantly reducing it.  It's an utter pain in the arse for the miner or ratter or solo pvper. 
---
Just to jump a few gates solo guys have literally scan everywhere and then you've no idea what's on the other side.  Expecting people to pay a sub just to scout is a little unreasonable.  So yes for decent pvp groups it's great for others I'm not sure because it feels the scales have tipped far to the pvp end.  Needs to have some balance.
---
I do feel this will negatively impact the economy somewhat and some point. Might not be a bad thing tho.
---
What would be interesting is removing stargate and that you warp into a random spot in that system instead
---
And there was I, thinking this was about ecm.

I've red a couple of news articles and blogs but none of them mentioned VNI change date?
---
G0P-ST0P is one of the others on the list. How many of those kills were industrials near trade hubs?
---
Turns out we are also doing ok
---
Oh, lovely. Someone else who recognizes he's lost the plot.
---
I was just thinking about this today. Freighters have no jump drive and do not require tech 2 components however jump freighters require tech 2 components. So why do capitals not require tech 2 components to be built? I can see getting away with get regular capitals not requiring tech 2 components however why not super capitals?
---
I even upvoted your comment, but the try hards won't get it until it's too late.
---
i like the idea of an active module that requires fuel for tethering.   CCP should agree as this would also be an asset/isk sink
---
You growing weed back there?

It's a stretch, but I'll allow it.

Reminds me of the old P4 build I did for my mom years ago. She hates any sort of fan noise, so I built a her a completely fan-free PC using the biggest goddamn CPU heatsink I could find, a slightly modified copper CPU heatsink for the graphics card, and left the case panels off.  
---
  
---
It did eventually fry itself but it took about six years.
---
I had issues with it a bit today, but i waited and they went away.
---
Missed the joke there
---
I think this was always a mistake by CCP. Sure, regular caps are ok, but supers and titans should have been like T2/T3 builds... If they were that much more complicated we would see a lot less supers and titans nowadays, even with all the rorqual mining over the years...

just do it yourself.
---
Isnt Waffles just an alt corp to panfam? This was my understanding always and now I check their KB's I note that this is validated when looking at whom they shooting at. Seems that you have to go to a few regions in space to find any content now, so well done CCP on killing most of null sec.
---
Its great for this group of players but this is very few players when considering the masses that play eve. Not everyone would sign up to this style of play and as an AU based TZ player eve is dead as shit. Talking with colleagues spread throughout eve the same story arises, no one around.
---
Only good thing I see in blackout is botting appears less common in null, and a few groups find hunting better in a few frigates or nano ships.
---
&gt;because it feels the scales have tipped far to the pvp end
---
Pretty much the entire eve community has been saying they think it has, over the last 2-3 years, tipped too far to the pve end. This includes eve devs like hilmar and falcon. So this is a step in the right direction, along with (i hope) many of their upcoming changes.
---
&gt; nonsense
---
Hehehe
---
Don't need a big change to have a big impact.
---
And the Mach is still the fastest battleship, and the Barghest isn't far behind
---
You ran from a fight and called the people you ran from risk averse after our numbering a target multiple dozen:one.
---
No it wasn't, like having been playing for most of that time we went from a meta where let's give them a good fight guy's was a common thing to get them out of here by any means so we can go back to grinding isk is the common approach. 
---
Was every fight a honor brawl fuck no, would you get blobbed from time to time yes, but there where enough groups around that liked to fight, so that getting a fight wasn't this exercise in futility for smaller groups, now day's it's kinda arrange fight or get blobbed.
---
That is one station I do not want to walk in.
---
It's all officer, that's how he gets kills
---
For him good pvp is shooting easy targets that don’t fight back , afk boats , lol even rats shoot back !
---
I don’t get your logic , just want easy kills and think that’s good pvp.
---
We need to go afk so these pvpers will pvp or they simply will complain the game is too hard.
---
Imagine u call ganking a rorq a "gud fight".. So their superfleet also can claim u dont gave them a "gud fight".. Is every explo frig who dont take a fight with the roaming nano cruiser gang risk averse aswell?
---
Comrade dyatlov there is graphite on the roof
---
The "waffles is an alt corp to PL" is a myth and misunderstanding of larger groups that is probably a decade old.
---
Infact, for the first time in a long time (probably ever) waffles isn't even blue to PL.
---
Idk what you mean by "looking at who you are shooting at" because we shoot pretty much every one in nullsec besides horde and NC who are our friends. We have killed ships in 51 different regions this week according to zkill. With cap kills in Omist, fountain, cobalt edge, feyth and others. 
---
This change may not be great for the "masses" in eve, and thats okay. The arguement is generally that they've had it too easy for a few years now, and this just turns the tide a little more in favor of people who play the game differently than most.
---
Its still more safe than it used to be long ago. Just look at the Black ops battleship dropping meta. Olmeca gold pointed out the number of kills in a Sin has dropped drastically over the years and hunting in a BS is much, much less fruitful than it used to be. Still alot of black ops content as far as bridging in t3s, or bombers, but hardly anyone drops the BS like they used to in nullsec.
---
Yo are you really gonna complain about people spamming blops ships
---
Just cyno in a hel somewhere in system, warp it to the grid and farm ur killmails xdd
---
If it can't take the risk în null, that frig sould go explore în high sec, yeah.
---
I very carefully entered all tech I, faction, and tech II ships and modules into an excel spreadsheet, and set up a price calculator primarily using index(match to give me exact material cost for any item I've catalogued so far.  I account for skill levels, citadel/station bonus, and blueprint research levels to produce my amounts.  I enter a set of prices for minerals and secondary/tertiary moon materials to give an approximate after-tax cost to manufacture the item.
---
It's been very helpful for running industry jobs as well as having given me further insight into EvE's market and economy by extension.
---
Who says learning excel has to be a chore?
---
You're such a Karma whore.
---
Subcaps exist for a reason.  
---
Especially booshers.
---
go to the sidebar, click edit, choose your flair. just like you do everywhere else on reddit.
---
Lol I was there :) 
---
But this was like 10 days ago or so. Why putting it now ?   
---
Already stopped playing. That was my last action. GF guys.
---
Next time bring a mobile cyno inhib. Also fighters are trash against ab bombers.
---
sniggwaffe was in PL for about a year from oct 2017 to sept 2018
---
they’ve always been close, but not an alt corp.
---
Gotta be a troll, 'rorq didn't even try to warp' - because it would have been sieged while mining?
---

Why I never hear anything about them except these arts? Where and what this coalition is doing?

naive soul
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!
---
yes, milk a game! give away stuff you can also buy! That is how you make money.
---
You man are a genius.
---
/sarcasm off
---
They most likely do it, that alphas can progress easier to their 20mio SP mark. As alphas are a core part of their future of eve plan, and they currently hit a quite hard wall at 5mio SP
---
&gt;Didn't even try to warp :))
---
You're demonstrating your ignorance of game mechanics here.
---
I bet the huge increase to 116 active members will have enormous impact on the success of the game.
---
Damn dont drink to mutch koolaid
---
Good idea, you also want to create a chan for that ?
---
I am an American living in EU.  Do you have a EU timezone group.  This blackout thing is making me want to re-sub and find a PvP group.
---
I did take a 2 year break from eve so yeah, you're prolly right. That rorq should have died tho.
---
Did the 64bit  version double the ram need?  I haven't checked since the update.
---
No, even a 2 year break doesn't excuse that ignorance.
---
The only problem I see here is that cyno inhibs are hrd to get up and easy to get around.
---
Finally something I can talk on.
---
Vanguard incursions are easy, a majority of your dps centers around Rattlesnakes (Or Domis) drone assisting to a drone bunny which is usually a Minmatar Recon or Vindicator based on preference. There are a few advantages of using Rattlesnakes over Domis. One is FoF rapid heavy missiles which clear most small stuff around you without having to target on any Rattlesnake, the second is it's natural buffer tank allowing you to fit 5-6 application mids with only a single deadspace or 2 T2 adaptives for tank.
---
There is really only 2 toons you have to actually use after a site is setup is your Logistics which is either a self-tank Nestor or T3,your drone bunny and maybe swapping through your rattles to restart their rapid heavies.
---
Self tank variations do exist but I find them slower than the single Logi due to having to give up all your mids for tank but only getting a single extra dps toon.
---
Domi variation with Nestors: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T1EA0pEsVs
---
Rattles with T3 logi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5pTDAENDGI
---
Where is the CODE when you need them
---
Tyvm!!
---
Finally! Right?
---
Thats actualy a rule in eve also
---
This is a poster one of our guys made     
---
If you are interested in joining we are open  we currently still in high sec but in a month or 2 we go to lowsec to settle
---
He is from the times before the darknesssssss, from before rorqual 'rebalance'
---
I find losing the application mids to be very hurtful for a single extra toon but I agree it is easier.
---
Would be a small change to someone in hisec i suppose?
---
Might it be that blops have different profile of targets?
---
Don't get me wrong, I think them using the cyno at lets say 400km and warping in is perfectly fine.
---
Bombs look quite different from when i used them on release
---
Step 1: Buy resources at Jita.
---
Step 2. Plug resources into blueprint.
---
Step 3: Not profit.
---
In the cargobay I hope? Haha. If not please PM me the stuff so we can check it out. 
---
As we can only improve the site with feedback as we can’t cover all the input users would give :)
---
A tiny (10 or so) man alliance held sov for a month and padded our killboards in counterganking in tribute. :)
---
Catalyst needs a criminal skin
---
I mean I can tell you’re being a smartass but I can’t exactly see what your point is?
---
Yes, they were. The lack of a low power state only enhanced those arguments, and low power was introduced to somewhat address them by making it easier to destroy unfueled structures.
---
Before low power, the only downside to not fueling a structure was lack of access to services like market or cloning.
---
Currently using 29gb with 16 clients open. 64-bit. Most of them are docked.
---
I'd go 64gb nowadays
---
The balance is dont solo in nullsec, problem solved.
---
Do you mean player response fleets or NPC response fleets?
---
EVE multiboxing with some kind of sane budget is basically threadripper at the moment.
---
What I did was tried Windows 10 in 2016, didn't like it, went back to Windows 7, and then upgraded to Win 10 again this year (since my computer is still eligible for upgrade because I tried them 3 years ago) and noticed that most problems I had with them have been fixed by now.
---
Its not like we havn't had no local before
---
This would be fucking amazing
---
Butterfly effect
---
That sounds awesome. Like extend the range of the cyno inhib to 400 km and reduce it's activation timer to something like 5 - 10 seconds. They should also add a module for the force recons or something that automatically pops a buble 100 kms from the cyno or right on top of the cyno so we can keep on pvping that rorq or whatever.
---
With the proper changes anyone can be a good pvper in eve, they just need some help.
---
Probably 90% of their kills are silly people ignoring big freaking popup about a war on undock.
---
As far as I know this is no violation of the EULA or the developer license. Would be a strange thing since its one of the most used ways to communicate with users 😂. 
---
Besides we would really need it to create a sort of notification system so you know someone left a comment at your fitting or someone replied at one 😉.
---
Hilmar has no idea what's happening in game.
---
Shame about the CEO has the emotional maturity of a 2 year old
---
POS spam of the past was also a pain to shoot down, so no, both difficulty and quantity are the problems.
---
Oh of course, I completely forgot about the slingshot issue. Either way you get a decent amount of damage out of Acolytes to help pressure and clear tackle, the extra speed in the medium drones helps a lot for putting a decent chunk of damage down more quickly onto anything larger.
---
CCP Please button to insta teleport and scram free rorq in space, please.
---
Low power should mean no tether. Too often defending entities get too much of a benefit by abusing this during a timer.
---
And even when they have blingy Leshaks supported by T3C's, and Guardians, they don't do too well when they find themselves in the unfortunate situation of actually having to fight, even if it's against fairly inexperienced people in cheap ships without much in the way of SP.
---
I like sharing this link:
---
 [https://br.inyour.space/?s=5311&amp;b=8650320&amp;e=90&amp;t=e](https://br.inyour.space/?s=5311&amp;b=8650320&amp;e=90&amp;t=e)
---
So a guy in a mining ship didn't want to fight 80 stealth bombers and that some how means he's the bad guy here? I don't get it.
---
So the guy called in his friends and that somehow makes rorq guy the bad guy here? 
---
I don't get this sentiment at all. Why should anyone feel obligated to fight you? Why do you feel like you're entitled to fights? Do do realize that not everyone wants the same gameplay experience as you, right?
---
For anyone curious, this is probably how most of the rankings are calculated for corps/players/weekly/alltime: 
---
https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard/blob/79a1022729a5e4ba7da9a5d5bb066aa86cbceb37/cron/9.ranksAlltime.php
---
                $avg = ceil(($shipsDestroyedRank + $iskDestroyedRank + $pointsDestroyedRank) / 3);
---
                $adjuster = (1 + $shipsEff + $iskEff + $pointsEff) / 4;
---
                $score = ceil($avg / $adjuster);
---
Basically, it takes into account all 3 variables, not just points.
---
or, if you're not into instant gratification and just train at 2700 sp per hour and plex, with 500 plex costing 1.844b atm, that's about 948.5 isk/sp (and you get a month of omega time on top of that, no extra charge!) regardless of your char sp :P
---
thus the accelerator value is below 122'933'333 isk, depending on how much you consider the omega time worth
---
Op wanted PvP, the rorq pilot gave him lots of PvP.
---
No idea why op is complaining tbh.
---
Have they themselves become sleepers?
---
There are already two ship classes that already do the job: Interdictors and Heavy Interdictors.
---
Remote bubbles are something only supers can do and we should keep it that way.
---
Its an Erebus isnt it?
---
Neither OP nor the Rorqual pilots friends want PvP
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78128849/
---
That's how retarded most of this sub has become, its almost entertaining in a slow-motion-trainwreck kind of way.
---
Well, he's complaining because he couldn't get a fight where he had an 80:1 advantage.
---
Its a dirty word and i can hear eve trolls hissing already... but this issue is not new to MMO's ie WoW people grind out the best raid gear etc then new raid or expansion comes out with new shit etc the old stuff or yesterdays hotness if you will becomes the ordinary or blues from the new expansion are better than your purple for example, the players of eve are just the sort who go okay whats optimal how do i get my empire to be optimal and then work it to that level if that limit was titans then one group would have lots of those if the "best" was a Ibis then that group would have lots of those.. 
---
The point is don't blame the players for this its on CCP for not keeping up with times and having innovation in their core business product, lots of money wasted on side projects like dust etc but no real honest expansion work has been done on eve, turn of local or raise taxes isn't really a expansion or keeping up with the player base.
---
Dreddit is recruiting!
---
memo to myself: Today I learned, that good pvp means outnumbering single ships multiple times...  or?
---
yes but how
---
they will probably be obtain able in future too, i think they have given marshals to people who attend events etc.
---
That actually doesn't work very well. Jamming them, however...
---
OP says cyno are bad. OP says they cynoed 80 duds on that Rorq. vOv
---
to what benefit though. are you one of those guys who thinks what way his ship is faceing matters on align times?
---
Who isn't looking for blingy ships when they're out blopsing? If you want those you don't go to big bloc space because if you bling on a subcap there you'll get mocked forever (if you're a noteworthy player). Some people I know lost a blingy ship years ago and are still getting reminded about it now and then.
---
While you're at it, allow rotation however it may be \*after\* the thing has anchored ffs ...
---
How do Jump freighters die in ls, dont they just jump to cyno at structure, dock, undock and warp to the gate, take gate? or just undock and jump to other cyno?
---

---
Is this some sort of elaborate wardec trick, are they a front for some established group or there's just people wanting to lose a fortizar in perimeter?
---
Tell me where the nasty snuffie touched you
---
Yeah sorry directors too but even so point still stands.
---
The black ops battleship meta completely died with carrier buff. I know that cause I used to love dropping them years ago. Taking Olmeca statistics on its own is always dangerous as he seeks to change a game to suit his own agenda 'every author or editor has a motive'. 
---
I have close to 10k kills and I don't disagree some things need to change but null is more dangerous than a WH now. I cannot find anything when I go out in AU tz outside of major block sov. That balance is now also out of whack with the traditional player progression and ISK V reward when balanced against WH play.
---
I have flown regions to find nothing. Mining is almost exclusive to Delve, Malpais and Esoteria. I note that even fraternity mining ships are now dieing in Malpais, so they now mining under the PanFam umbrella? It just proves the point that this is just fucking Null as eventually it will all just dry up entirely on current trajectory. Long term that means content will also dry up. I have only been in game 7 years and this is the quietest I have ever seen Eve in my TZ. It keeps up and I will join friends now considering their options out of game as there is no one left to play with.
---
As a Developer, don't simply just look at a single metric and thing "Oh this one change has solved ALL of our problems". All of those bots might not be running right now, but they sure as hell are waiting for theird cheatmakers to release a new version of their script/program that simply presses V every 5 seconds and does some simple pixel reading, we're already starting to see these bots popping up, they start warping the moment they see anything abnormal.
---
I will also point out that Even with the blackout, most of the Fights I've had that aren't huge 255 man fleets have either been one sided Gatecamps (#elitepvp btw) or going into Jspace to kill shit, you know it's bad when Null sec players are so damn hungry to find any meaningful content that isn't just Ganking one another.
---
Also, the prospect can't fit two huffers, cloak, and a probe launcher.
---
So I always scout out a chain, BM all the gas, and come back in Ventures, the two of them can get all of the smaller cloud before the sleepers arrive.
---
They cost so much less than a Prospect I sold the pair I got and just built a bunch of Ventures to YOLO at any gas I find.
---
Like this is what i am asking.
---
Probably a bit different to most of the tales of epic pew pew in this thread, but Eve is a sandbox, and we all play in our own way.   
---
As part of [Eve Scout's Search and Rescue program](https://evescoutrescue.com/home/), last week I helped rescue a stranded pilot from a wormhole, and this week one of the caches I tended was used by another pilot in a rescue.

Shit goes down in a highsec system, a button pops up on your UI that lets you "cyno" in after X period of time.  Once the blinky is dead, you get auto-booshed back to where you where.  I could get down with that.  There would be so many pirate tears though.
---
This is as close to the real thing as you will ever see. This is a capsuleer’s capsuleer.

This is “Oh, you’ve got me locked and pointed. Good for you, do you want a cookie?” kind of badass.

Look forward to seeing you again pucho
---
You can web out to a long range with a Loki and with a faction point, you can keep a decent distance (not at PC to check specifics in PYFA right now).
---
But I think the neuting of the Domi has quite some range also...
---
Can I come on fleets? Even if I'm from another corp?
---
Does your mother approve of this in her basement?
---
God forbid that space is actually fucking dangerous. Christ.

Congratulations guys o7
---
It took us a while to get the video processed, the guy who took the footage has steam-powered internet :(
---
It was great fun! Wish the titans had been subcaps or more dreads/carriers though.
---
Pointing up is always better. Then as you turn gravity will assist in the turn. Down is the worst, then you're fighting gravity.
---
&gt;Isnt Waffles just an alt corp to panfam?  This was my understanding always and now I check their KB's I note that this is validated when looking at whom they shooting at. Seems that you have to go to a few regions in space to find any content now, so well done CCP on killing most of null sec.

Are they though?  [https://zkillboard.com/related/30001133/201907140300/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001133/201907140300/) 
---
:thinking:
---
I think he meant belly up, not nose down.
---
gravity? -.- 
---
so we have a goon who thinks facing his procurer a certain way matters in this game, and a TEST guy who thinks theres gravity in space, god help us
---
then drag the names of each blueprint from market into your In game notepad.
---
delete them as you go.
---
80% of people.play solo.  Check the stats
---
But a 80 pilot bomber fleet will kill everything it won't die to and will run from everything that can scratch them since they are as tankless as a cargo fit venture. If they bring in a few gudfite battleships you bomb them, if they bring caracals you run or die. What did you expect, a similar bomber fleet?
---
Yes, there's obviously gravity even in space.
---
Thank   
---
Do you happen to have any other blingy vessels with a lot of killmarks on them?  Those that you are going to undock, of course...
---
Why?
---
Yep - allowing fleets of any size to attack whatever they want leads to the constantly seen issue of blobbing - if mechanics were ever put in place to encourage more even fights, the game would overall be better.
---
I know how to fix cyno, lets us hot drop wormhole people in their natural habitat and we are all good and balanced.
---
Can you imagin how much content it would bring to the game.
---
When have you ever met a CEO who manages a 450+ toon corp that isn't insane? It's years of putting up with idiots like you.
---
like a magnetic field from a 'magnet' has a noticeable range of affect.
---
then it has a un-noticable range of affect.
---
then eventually. it has no effect.
---
gravity is the same. there is no gravity 'IN' space. there is gravity around mass. in space there is mostly empty 'mass-less' area. or at least outside of the range of the closest gravity creation.
---
I'm not talking to random small-to-mid scale content at all, which you've been failing to grasp for like a month already. Changes to asset vulnerability and power projection can bring more of it back, as you've been saying. Also, I've never claimed to be okay or not okay with current situation, which I'm indifferent to despite your repeated allegations of me taking stance here.
---
I've been saying that I don't see a solution to make sandbox game where groups banding up and blueing each other don't gain power over those who don't. Without breaking sandboxiness of it, that's it.
---
That's literally the entirely of my point. I'm not interested in discussing specific activities in isolation, nor do I care to qualify metas as "good" or "bad". That's merely opinions and they are not worth breaking spears over either.
---
my apologies, I've read it in a hurry. This would be such a great change.
---
Not sure how I feel about this anymore.
---
My experience trying to save a Rorqual in Delve showed me that no, I cannot alpha an inhib down with my carrier in any realistic scenario. When I tried I, and the super on grid with me, were defanged in a very short order by a 30ish man fleet of feroxes and logi. When I ran out of fighters I had to light my own cyno before the inhib went online. While we still saved the Rorqual, it wasn't because of my fighters taking down the inhib. iirc a dread ended up coming in on my cyno and popping the inhib.
---
On the flip side, when we were ganking a renter Rorqual, we onlined the inhib before he lit his cyno. When the reinforcements came they had to rely on cyno ceptor that came in a 100+km and then died shortly after. The faxes were too far to save him and the super couldn't break our reps. Obviously our target died and we moonwalked out.
---
On one hand it does very much favor the defender, especially currently, but on the other, when it's able to serve its function, it's pretty much GG for the ganked. Inhibs need to be changed so that the outcome isn't so one-sided. Perhaps give it resists but make it so that disrupts the navigation lock on and delays the jump for x amount of time. Whether it favors the defender, or they buff it and it favors the attacker, it's gonna be broken either way.
---
Hi, I solo roam through Delve, single account, no scouts or anything. Since the blackout, I've fought so many impromptu response fleets that warp to tackled Ishtars and Myrms, or fought defense fleets/gatecamps into ratting pockets. 
---
Roaming Delve has become damn fun and enjoyable for me, and I have no plans or a need to have a scout to "see what's on the other side".
---
Congrats..  I'm happy for you. But this game does not revolve around just you.
---
You spoke for solo PvPers without being one, assuming how many of us operate............
---
People complaining about lack of money, when there are so many unlooted wrecks in invaded areas.

your content will dry as those people you farm will quit getting farmed. this is what happens every time.
---
yeah i looked more at pictures after I asked and that's the conclusion i came to. most Erebus pics are front or side shots but this seems to be from behind so i didn't recognise it.
---
I read somewhere that if the time remaining on promotion is less than the time the accelerator lasts you won't be able to inject it meaning that this accelerator probably won't work now. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong since my sources were old.
---
What are you on about, there are no magnets in space. It's real simple, gravity goes down.
---
im going to leave you with that
---
The lag I get every time I open the skill screen (whatever it's called) and the map. There are probalby other places too but it should not freeze up my game if I'm only playing on one client at the time.
---
I am one.....I also have 2 accounts.   Maybe you dont have a life maybe you can spend 10 hrs on eve a day, maybe you need to get out more.  After 15 years I've dedicated more than enough time to eve.  I no longer want to spend fucking 10 minutes per fucking jump just to scan and and scout everywhere.. I dont pay subs to do that shit. And no I dont want to be running Into 50 gate camps either it to go back where I fucking started.  I dont mind losing ships at all but damn I'm not going keep banging my head against a wall.
---
Hey maybe it's a sign to unsub for Good like many have.
---
Cool vid! Makes me want to give it a try. In fact, I think I might. Do you use any implants?
---
Nice video mate, good fights. One thing I would suggest (if you're hoping to appeal to newer pvp pilots) is to maybe show the recording of some losses as well?
---
It's nice to see some common mistakes made, as well as all of the good things. For example those comets you killed would have chewed you up if they were AB fit. 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_AGa9w\_Q7C8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AGa9w_Q7C8)  &lt;-- Here is a vid I did a while back showing some kills and some losses. 
---
Anyway great video! I subbed to your channel, looking forward to the next one o7
---
I play maybe an hour a day lmao. I don't waste time scouting or dscanning. More fun to go in blind.
---
only being able to fit one asb was also a great change.
---
I recomend trying out incursions in high sec, nice isk gain, they help you out on guestions you have and no need to join corp or other commitments.
---
That absolutely fine if that's YOUR playstyle and that's great.  It's great attitude for no fucks given pvp
---
 But all I'm saying many other solo people mission, mine, rat , explore and pvp.
---
It doesn't say when
---
Automating inputs, especially macro style, combining Alt tabbing with other input (alt tab plus attack for example) is a bannable offense. No, "I've been doing it and haven't been banned" doesn't make it allowed
---
I'm reminded of that one cartoon of the guy riding a bike, shoving a stick in the front spoke, and then on the floor holding his knee, blaming the bike for his own doing.
---
So a slow and painful death for that machine...
---
I don't know about insane but I've met plenty CEOs who get shit done without chucking a tanty.
---
Also sick burn bruh
---
And you, yourself, can barely manage your zipper, let alone a dynamic group of pilots who seem to be having fun.
---
I've missed you guys so much I can't wait :3
---
when they can get a new killmail every few minutes they will not get bored as fast tho 
---
biggest issue with timers is that it takes a set amount of time no matter how much you bring
---
Yeah pitty Bastion called init.
---
But our dreads were doing nerly 0 damage even with HAW guns. Was not able to do anything to you..
---
Free killmails, that is what they expect.
---
The changes are already in place
---
Some people are just idiots.
---
Just two them, have an actual fleet comp
---
Since when?
---
Where's my gold you fucking liar.
---
its just not really a "state sanctioned activity" so to speak, barring pirate level 4s which are not my cup of tea.
---
Make EVE dangerous, let us be REAL outlaws
---
Triglavian ships overshadows every other sub cap in game. 
---
Its like , wow T3 crusiers are cancer, lets wait 6 years then nerf them to where they properly fit in. Btw, have these new broken ships that over shadows all sub caps like t3 crusiers did.........
---
[Doubt it](https://zkillboard.com/related/31001882/201907250300/)
---
Please don't comment if you don't understand balance in the slightest 😀
---
A rust outline of your ship.
---
WHer btw \^\^
---
Yeah, if the fax wall wasn't an inevitability after titans are dropped we'd consider having a crack at them. You could probably do better if you wanted to fight rather than push us off with the right subs though :)
---
I love how they downvote one of the most active multiboxers for answering questions helpfully in a multiboxing thread
---
but the MeMeS mUsT fLoW :)
---
This is the truth,  the bullshit from PVE fairies talking about lacking logins and lacking progress and no ratting are talking shit.
---
Even the domi he killed had a cyno lmao.
---
They have no resists and a velocity of 0, which means literally everything has no problem to hit them
---
&gt; Triglavian ships overshadows every other sub cap in game. 
---
except for everything that outranges them, which is everything.  thier an RR brawler fleet.
---
This is actually the best advice in the thread.
---
&gt;Mass limit so capitals don't get spammed 10 at a time. This should encourage people to use more expensive ships as cyno beacons for the extra tank, like the ones blops use and give small gang pvp a fighting chance.
---
looool, this change would actually mean - warp 20 corvettes with cynos on grid and light them all.
---
The radio chatter was so great
---
It's getting hard to tell the difference between badposts and satire.
---
I think this is satire, but I'm not sure.
---
Not what that means, still doesn't belong in the title. Basically you are an idiot.
---
Top tier shitposting.
---
You're retarded lmao.
---
Please, please assist Hilmar with committing suicide before he destroys this game! Or at least stop supplying him with cocaine!!!
---
They dont though. They're extremely easy to counter, it's just taking a while to figure out
---
You mean, it will positively affect the economy? You are aware of rampant inflation, aren't ya? 
---
It is balanced right now, before it was tilted to much into safety that we now have people like you REE about balance.
---
Sometimes they jump to a bait freeport - a player structure made to look like anybody can dock in it, except there's someone ready to remove access and point you as soon as your cyno goes up. Sometimes they just get volleyed by a super while they align or even while they're still loading the grid. Sometimes their cyno placement is less than perfect, and they end up a few kilometers off the station docking range. Sometimes they undock from a kickout station and get pointed. Etc etc.
---
As someone who actively defends in Impass/Catch, you guys have brought me great fun and a serious interest in wormhole space. I'm proactively doing recon into the big wormhole corps to see who can actually defend their space. It's gonna be an interesting year for me.
---
There is content in all timezones lately.
---
EUTZ was a bit weak lately but Id said we are almost getting even.
---
&gt;  11 day final timers 
---
No structure, powered or unpowered should take over a week and a half to kill.
---
Wtf are u talking taking risk isnt taking the fight..
---
Celestis is the best ewar ship in eve and dont let anyone tell you otherwise
---
Im not talking about going up against a F1 monkey fleet. Im talking about vs another small gang with same numbers. Brawl fleet? Since when does a brawl fleet shoot 40+K? Hell i think that battleship hits out to 50k. Doesn’t need dedicated logi, has a fuck ton of utilities high, lots of mids, great tank, resistance, capacitor, etc. 
---
Please inform me what ship of the same class can go head to head in a 6v6? Their isn’t one which is why its OP.
---
That's why you go big dick with the beam stratios
---
I replied to the other guy. You’re more than welcome on inputing your knowledge.
---
&gt;C4 's are the norm for PvP homes
---
🤔
---
Hey I am also new! Got into my first big fight last night and did well. Joined a wormhole corp early on and have been doing scouting in an astero or hound. Found a few targets back to back that lead to a large scale fight. Got kill assists on a tengu, 2 stratios's, and was present but I was playing a bit too careful for a fight against a bhaalgorn, sacrilege, and two other battlrcruisers. Was the first time I had a lot of fights in one night and I didn't stop till I got blown up. I swapped out my hound for a cheap thrasher just to get brawling experience and it felt great dying in glorious combat after taking down some blingy ships :D
---
Disrupt ESI it make blackout useless and isk botters come back.
---
hey got to make sure them roid's to run away
---
so.
---
much.
---
Miss you, Baltrom, glad to see you're back. Niko says hi.
---
This is so misleading - the amount of alts and insider info snigg has access to absurdly skewing your effectiveness, no other "small corp" has this and you know it.
---
https://br.inyour.space/?s=3788&amp;b=8716380&amp;e=90&amp;t=bf
---
Forgot to add the BR.
---
Ya we have a very active EUTZ, they log on en masse and feed almost every day
---
may as well go join code
---
I am in oicz/eha area and there is pvp to be had daily. Frigs are what you see the most of....like 5 billion dramiels
---
&gt; Since when does a brawl fleet shoot 40+K?
---
Since forever, fuck old RR geddon fleets could hit that far when they still had lasers, armor hacs hit that far.
---
&gt;Please inform me what ship of the same class can go head to head in a 6v6
---
The AF will lose to most other AFs, its range is trash.
---
The frigate will lose to most other solo frigates, its ramp is trash.
---
The cruiser is fast, but its range is gimped to shit, so you're just going to get kited by something like ONI's which are as fast or faster than you with significantly better range, fuck Orthis with a proper fit can keep a Vedmak pinned indefinitely until they rapid light it to death.
---
Ferox's simply avoid dreks all together, and murder them beyond drek shooting range.
---
Like do you even play EVE? In class is where Triglavian ships shine the least, they're countered by most of their own class.  What they do better than most ships is punch upwards, where as most ships we're used to hit downwards ok or punch across the isle, Triglavian ships generally fail in class and punch upwards instead.
---
The blackout already offered us some nice experiences:
---
Watching a mining op and preparing to make a drop when all in a sudden another ship decloacks and you see a hotdrop on top of the miners "live" from another hunter group.
---
Welcome to ghost sites?
---
If thats the case, then these new tax changes should only apply to highsec transactions. Concord does do anything in null
---
"Protein not sourced from Capsuleer Corpses GUARANTEED"
---
Who the fuck says REE? Are you 12?.  How is a 10b super balanced? How is a 45b titan balanced? How is  space station for 900m balanced? 
---
I actually want prices to go up on things.  
---
Its not balanced at all. Bring in a always on display scanning HUD.  Bring in the ability to combat cloaky ships or there has to be significant restrictions to using a cloak. Then it will be balanced
---
you are right ... until you hit the assignment limitation ... that was patched in to nerf Slowcat-Blobs and Kiting Drone Doctrines
---
They are collecting tax'es now and giving FreeSP.
---
&gt; I have flown regions to find nothing
---
how is that different from before the blackout?
---
He took the L admirably. It wasn't a big deal. Horrid fit  though.
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
Its quite different. Now, after no local, theres blood in the water. I see more and more complaining about certain aspects that dont really involve them. Its hivemind mentality. And its so fking tiresome to hear children bicker.
---
What about t3cs? 
---
I want a Loki skin that makes my cruiser look like a coast guard vessel
---
I like when you share that link
---
Just the catalyst.
---
The upvotes have spoken.
---
Just attacking them. They got salty as fuck because they couldn't catch or kill a frigate. Also they dont have any structures so not anything for me to really hit. There is a much larger group I'm working to evict but they seem to have all quit playing over the last couple weeks so I'm gonna get the alliance together and just go hammer on their fortizar. Once I burn down their house I can start on the rest of their shit and put up my own. They'll never be able to take it back because they have been hemorrhaging members due to the parent alliance taking more control over them. I actually just recruited 15 of there people the other night when they refused to show up to defend their peoples poco's. I showed up with a paltry force but because I gave a shit and showed up they dont care that we lost they were just happy to have people willing to help.
---
Valid question tainted by blackout salt
---
5/7
---
This. Its hilarious. This sub is filled with too many people trying to find ways around problems.
---
Shield slaves are a meme anyway.
---
CCP has announced them for 5 years now and have yet to deliver.
---
The 1st Myrm too
---
Jam the rorq, no panic
---
How much isk did CCP give you to write this post?
---
Maybe this all goes way back and I'm just taking jabs for gigs.
---
Miner correction: The first "nerf" to the rorqual was actually CCP fozzie realizing there were mining rigs that enhanced drones which he forgot to factor in the numbers he posted on the forums.
---
I don't think they ever will actually release them, they'd be hard to balance and would require several attempts knowing ccp. Which in their timeline would be several years, until that point they'd be op or trash. I'd rather they didn't, it only cause more headaches
---
the trick is to be cap stable
---
The aggression timer was an example for any kind of timer that would prevent instant tethering. But you know, memes don't really capture nuance. And it turns out they implemented pretty much exactly what I was asking for...
---
If you want shield slaves released, you're going to have to nerf every shield module and bonus in the game to compensate.
---
Following
---
July? Yes, July 2050. 
---
But in all seriousness, Armour Slaves were just renamed to Amulet on SiSi. That's the important first step - free-up the name for the next set.
---
Misleading seems to be todays reality. Kinda says alot when so many feel motivated to lie and deceive over something.
---
My main and only char is 20 mil into gallente ships.
---
Jokes on me, hybrids are the worst weapon in the game.
---
Finally a post that actually praises the blackout, I'm a part of a small corp that usually fields at max 10 guys and we've been getting no end of content from our null static, hunting ships is so much easier now, it was confusing seeing posts stating that everywhere is dead when anecdotally we've had so many more fights than before.
---
Pucho you returning for realsies?
---
[https://i.imgur.com/Ckho4fZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/Ckho4fZ.png) well they place this on eve amsterdam so :)
---
They probably realized that rebalancing half the ships in the game to add an implant set is a poor use of resources
---
I think you'll find it's fairly difficult to farm an entity to death when you live in a WH and connect to someone different on a daily basis.  Maybe you should limit your comments to when you actually know what the fuck you are talking about?
---
I'm glad retreating to wulfpax and becoming irrelevant has worked for you.
---
Can you link your killboard?
---
Thanks for the feedback man I like the idea of showing some losses.
---
you should maybe check what they said about this changes in July [https://i.imgur.com/NvrBIKPl.png](https://i.imgur.com/NvrBIKPl.png)
---
Do you even play eve?
---
Thank you for killing all the bots
---
Maybe they just aren't designed to be reliably repped by logis?
---
Wouldn't a big, silent fan be a better option? :P
---
Haha I wish. I just really want to dive into the game
---
I think it’s so fascinating the depth to it
---
Yo. Hilmar. About your "purple donut" comment, please listen to this.
---
The South is on fire.
---
Thanks for sharing. It was fun. We couldn't break the abaddons after we lost a few nightmares during the initial brawl due to the amount of logi you had.
---
However we got a few nice ganks during the gate games in the aftermath of the fight.
---
GF
---
Big oof. That’s tough :( how much were you hauling at the time? Still 27 jumps through null has to be impressive in itself
---
No local doesnt punish large groups and it doesnt create any diminishing returns. And stop talking about supers so much, they dont get used that much to warrant it (outside of Delve). They are probably the most underused ships in the game actually.
---
And not really, because we can still outblob any small group or even big ones. 
---
You know who cant? The smaller guys. Which is why we are seeing them join the blocs.
---
Wait that sounds super helpful! Would you ever consider posting the worksheet? That’s seriously a hell of an accomplishment and you definitely put a fun spin on learning excel
---
Now tell us, where did the Vagabond touch you ?
---
I like it! What were you piloting during that time?
---
A vocal minority, not the majority. The majority of the hivemind that is this sub perhaps but by far not ingame. So you fked over the majority for a minority. Hmm wonder if there will be consequenses...
---
Everything T1 is fairly easy to make. Capitals get an extra layer in the way of having to build components to build ships rather than the direct minerals-&gt;ship all other ships have. One notable addition is that the components are somewhat pricy / long to research but those are very long term investments rather than a direct cost per ship.
---
While they could do with being a bit more complex considering their power... it's impossible to do now. Any changes made would just fuck over the future players and groups since the established powerblocs already have their capitals and could churn out a crapton more to stock up before any changes. It'd leave a very broken playing field, even more so than now since nobody could possibly catch up unless you give it 5+ years of established powerblocs remaining powerful due to legacy-sourced supercapitals that now cost significantly more.
---
"""""ON FIRE"""""

16 actives members, 229 kills :) i can brag too ?
---
Blackout make leaving players? I swear that i read somewhere that was otherwise... Any info about this?
---
PD: If someone un tour corp leaves because blackout. Then you don't really need him in your corp in the first place.
---
To be honesty, we've been active for a long time now

I keep right clicking them but there doesn't seem to be any option to "consume" for some reason.

Shout-out to It is really us!
---
you made me hard... since i calculate value of things like this too :O
---
Why didn't you fight the supers? You wanted PVP right? Rorq pilot brought it right to your doorstep on an alt.
---
You mean unlike everything they have released that is totally balanced?
---
Lost in the blackout of Hilmar's ass.
---
do they also disassemble when you put pressure on them?
---
Read up on eve-o the devs had explicitly signed off on it
---
Hi o/
---
Not gonna be able to say anything new that all the other posts haven't said already, just gonna say that what we are seeing right now is CCPs attempting something new! 
---
I for one welcome the NEW to Eve online at any time! :)
---
Albeit I would prefer not having TAXes fucking me (not only  in real life, but now also on my game life) &gt;.&gt;
---
Those are really nice chairs actually, thanks for sharing.
---
&gt;I'll post my idea of a Mobile Krab Inhibitor / Mobile PVP Enhancer later, i'm on my phone right now.
---
Please don't lol
---
Who are you?
---
hahahahahha
---
You think this is bad i hear redline is selling discounted blowjobs behind the newark dennys..
---
See https://forums.eveonline.com/t/summer-2019-new-pirate-implant-sets/ too
---
Just someone who is happy one of the most inept players in EvE online is having fun.
---
Wasn't it great when Snuff were something to fear, as opposed to smack once and see go away ?
---
Oh, I will!
---
Give r/eve an inch and they take a mile itt
---
Why does actual good content only get a few updoots every time? :/
---
Nah, they'll release them hilariously broken and be caught ENTIRELY off guard that it broke half the ships in the game.  They'll then leave them like that for a year and then suddenly realize its broken and hotfix in something that breaks as much as it fixes.  You know, like everything this team does.
---
You took the time to respond tho lol
---
I have an i7 4 core and it's peaking out so running potato mode on 8 cores or so should do the trick. Assume each client uses 1GB of ram to be on the safe side. Grab a 1070 or better, EVE graphics aren't insane but you'll probably play other games while playing EVE. Also Corsair fans and water cooled b/c the LED lighting makes your computer faster.
---
Pretty sure it was straight from Falcon and Hilmar.
---
 Currently using a dual Xeon e5-2670 setup with 64gb ram gpu doesn’t really matter.. had a 980ti and now a rtx 2080ti was able to use 35+ accounts
---
This post is really Krabs vs Hunters...
---
Krabs wants a boring game where you only afk farm until the end of times.
---
Hunters wants a dangerous game where you actually play and make things happen.
---
Guess what side I choose...
---
PS. Not sure what Veigar said is a good things to make things happen. I don't care I prefer CCP try things rather than doing nothing at all.
---
How do you know they are increasing for one? Considering CCP has used wrong datasets before (260m ticks).
---
When it comes to zkill, listening to Karer who actually seemed like he knew what he was doing when he analyzed the numbers he said that the first day had higher numbers but it went back to normal on day 2 (was on the INN show the week after blackout got implemented). 
---
Let me paint you a picture. We can agree that there were a lot of bots in the game right? Do you seriously think botting stopped? Or do you think they just moved to HS, which report after report indicates? Do you also think that to offset deficits more bots had to be created? It sounds fairly logical doesnt it? For every old bot you probably have 2 or 3 new. And the old ones arent even fully gone.
---
There you go, high DAU and MAU. And I havent even mentioned the login events.
---
And also, who do you think was keeping retention numbers up? And how?  Might it have been the "hey come join NS, get in a VNI, get some isk up, start flying what you want and if you need help just ask"? The same fking group that no longer can do it because subs are now shit in PvE. And you think CCP will be able to offset that number by fixing something they havent fixed in 16 years already?
---
I joined tonight, I'm a Bergmann!
---
When people understand that "staging" is the least safe place.    
---
It is one of the few systems that you are not supposed to gate to while you are not in fleet or nullified ship.           
---
No one care about what is happening in the staging due to how ingame mechanics works ... and mostly due to fact that you cannot keep safe stupid people that for some reason think it is safe to gate a freighter into the system.          
---
Staging is where for 23/7 dumb people roll in and die.
---
You should maybe read it too and realize that won't make it better, in fact it will likely make it worse since they're BUFFING shield regen mods, so you can get teh same effects with less slots.  Add in the slaves and its even more lol.  I can't wait to see how much gets broken with the release, you can already sim shield supers that have twice the HP of armor supers once these release.
---
my clients are only using up like 800MB ram, any extra ram needed I just download from that website you linked me
---
I've been playing on and off for years and I got my first solo kill in an incursus (in the hull, not overall lol). Pretty sure it was my first one anyway. I never could find a fit that worked.
---
You saying theres something wrong with being gay?
---
Got to give them a bit of a break right now. With the blackout appearing to be a permanent thing, they're quite busy adapting the bots for the new meta. No time to structure bash while the ISK printers are sitting idle.
---
Yes, atm I have issued a few people with the mission to draw me a banner, which I'll use for my space safari missions
---
Dying to get back in the business of fragging baddies and upsetting nerds :3 So, yeah, not only coming back but I'm coming back thirsty for space blood :3
---
All of the above under the assumption that buying PLEX and selling for ISK is still a thing, cause I sure as hell am not hebrewing no matter how good jspace hebrewing is... FUCK GRINDING
---
The first weekend of the blackout I killed all weekend without dying, got my first real solo kills, and seriously pissed off the swarm. I'm going back out tonight for a week long deployment and I'm getting more people into it. Because even people who weren't that interested in pvp are now!
---
For me if anyone is camping any gates or in your systems or anything like it you go kill them especially when you have a coalition of 20000! There is no excuses.  And they definitely should never  have been able to anchor citadels
---
Bought chair, couldn't get it out of box until there were 200 footrests in the room
---
C--- would not buy again
---
Shouldn't you change your nick to 401k or something ?
---
Very true. There's a reason why the "capital system" thing still exists, despite being wildly abused, and this is it. Staging systems are dangerous places.
---
no but you're gay pwnd and that's a fact
---
Flying a fragile frigate in nullsec, I'd expect nothing overly expensive if he is.
---
I scammed some noob on a real estate deal. He vowed revenge. Now I'm waiting to see if he'll do anything about it.
---
"alright guys we got another fanfest coming up... We don't have anything new to share, what can we say to hype up the player base?"
---
...
---
"we can try telling them that shield slaves are coming again for the 5th time"
---
"there's no way our players are that retarded"
---
Great post..
---
... for once.
---
Those are not brawl fleets, since when are beams brawl? Guess feroxes are brawl fleets too, sentry domies......brawl. You’re a fucking idiot
---
And ur a homophobic little bitch, who thinks too highly of oneself because you can use outdated leet speak? Maybe ur calling people gay, because ur trying so desperately to hide the fact that you yourself are gay and would love to suck aome dick right about now. Dont be shy and just ask. Im sure someone is willing to fulfil your gay fantasy
---
Hahaha +1
---
War fucking sucks in EVE, and it sucks even more when there's no reason. Until CCP changes the game in such a way that gives people a reason to go to war, expect the blue donut to continue glazing.
---
Yeah man, because small gang "f1" is so much more l33t than big gang "f1"
---
Oof
---
fucking why tho
---
Why would we do that? So we can be edgy teenagers again who run around "harvesting tears"?
---
Shhh. Wulfpax will blot out the sun.
---
Catalysts as well???
---
Glad it's working out for Waffles, but I'm still not sold on the blackout long term.  Small gang has needed some love for a long time but not sure this is going to be a long term boost to either small gang pvp or a good thing for the overall game long term.
---
Zkill all time stats say a lot for O3- given that most testies hadn't set foot in there until a couple of months ago. The astra opposite their keepstar has racked up 100b in kills from invites to fake fleets and warping them off the KS, including this nyx from yesterday. https://zkillboard.com/kill/78115155/
---
If you have 2 in diapers, they’re plentiful and all you can afford.
---
Hey hey... don't be changing the subject of the last 2 weeks - it's all about the blackout and creating chaos over the next year.  CCP don't have no time to worry about your shield slaves. &lt;/s&gt;
---
Kind of too early to tell if the blackout is making players leave. Numbers are highly inaccurate now because of the bombardment of free SP events and other plex/mtc discounts going on.
---
Once that dries up, and small-scale nullsec groups start feeling the burnout from the survival-mode ADM grinding, I have a feeling the numbers will change rather drastically.
---
Winterco is one of the few coalitions that honestly are awful, they have 2 good fcs and thats about it.
---
They dont adress any issues that are at their doorstep, if this happened in front of legacy staging or imperium staging, it would be shot down immediately
---
Sounds like they just don't care and if players aren't going to use gate pings, scouts or read intel they deserve to explode.
---
We Gettin' the team back together!!
---
It used to be.
---
However, have some history ...
---
PL historically had Sniggwaffe as it's feeder corp - if you weren't elite enough to get into PL, you joined Snigg, and then did stuff for a while, and then PL tapped you on the shoulder.
---
Then Test and Brave 1.0 happened, and PL realised mass recuitment corps would have some pilots worth recruiting, and snuggled up to Brave 1.0 and Test.
---
This kind of fucked up for PL, because when pushed came to shove they backed NCdot.
---
Then UALX happened, and it was clear PL didn't have super superiority, so Snigg and Grath looked at life without supercap superiority, and then they looked for a wormhole where they wouldn't need to deal with other people helicopter dicking them with supers.
---
And so we get the current situation.
---
Holy shit. It's almost like you got told 'With the blackout, people are going to snuggle the umbrella even harder'.
---
this would only be a good thing if local was brought back so that subcaps had a chance to actually form and contest subcaps that come in obviously, its woefully transparent how gankers see this change they want less and less risk to their ganking, they want to be able to get in with their small gang kill a large ship and get out without being contested in the slightest.   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ck4wrm/ccplease\_make\_pvp\_great\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ck4wrm/ccplease_make_pvp_great_again/)  &lt;&lt; refer to this post  
---
as u/Valkorsia_SPVG said I dare CCP to mass nerf supers and titans on top of this, because not only will you have taken away the false sense of security that local provides to krabbers making them want to be out in space you will piss off those that respond to save them making it so they literally have no reason to even bother. Space is empty enough outside of the nullblocs umbrella ranges, why in the hell would you want to make it sparser.
---
gotta get comfy when you don't undock
---
&gt; Why does everyone forget the literal years of research it takes to get the bpo up to standard.
---
To go from ME7 to ME8 is only 2 months for a super BPO and 3 months for a titan BPO in a rigged null sec Sotiyo. ME9 and 10 do happen but they're impractical.
---
They shouldn't be any camps anyway regardless. They should be removed. I just dont get why anyone allows any gate camps or gangs just to keep farming their players and do absolutely nothing. The mind boggles.  This isnt just in O3 its everywhere in Winter space.
---
Looks like Siberian Squad have moved Into OSY and again not one fight was put up.  The gates are camped all over even with BSOD and again absolutely nothing.
---
meh
---
PCU is how many people are actually in game at a specific point if that number is down space is empty, MAU includes the people who got to the log in screen to redeem the SP and then log off. MAU is a shit metric for judging health and it was pathetic that they ignored the PCU and brought out the MAU to try to convince us their poor decisions are working.
---
Ghoast site clouds.

The manbun is strong with this one...
---
How’d that play out exactly?
---
They fold up nice and neatly.
---
pffft...look at this guy with his low class fortizars.
---
I offer only the most exclusive vip fortizars starting at 100 billion isk, with higher prices available upon request.
---
Actually if we stored 4 bhaals in the caps that fleet is 3.125b tonnes or w/e, wich is actually an undermassed hole

Use the code bee for a 10% discount to faction titans.

Would you rather buy a c6 wormhole? No ihibs there. I believe kwell's c6 mag is always available to a good buyer.
---
Yeah im sure people reshipping to more dps to help grimd down the fax once all the subs were dead made all the difference
---
I didnt have a good experience with them either. I prefer noblechair.
---
Nah it would just be for fun
---
&gt; Spot a rorqual, covert cyno, bridge, up goes the cyno inhib, start pvping, right? Didn't even try to warp :)) I mean def afk or a bot.  
---
You do realize that rorquals use a module called an industrial core that keeps them pinned down for up to 5 minutes right ?
---
&gt; So that got me thinking, still with the blackout krabs are to risk adverse, any sign of trouble batphones a couple of supers and we got to GO. 
---
fix your doctrine and get good FC's. Theres some videos of Test and INIT with bomber gangs who take on small super fleets that come to save the rorquals. They end up killing rorquals and a nyx or 2. 
---
Here's some examples of bomber fleets taking out the response fleet and killing the rorquals. Stop being bad. You had 80 dudes, you really could do a lot of damage with that.

Nah nah they will know but let it be just like when they redid the T3 cruisers. I remember Fozzy saying we know the Loki will be the best but its been in a bad spot for so long its okay.. I was like wtf... is this how you fucking balance your stuff...  so yeah going off that they will probably release shield slaves completey overpowerd, but hey.... its okay thats how we balance stuff in this game.
---
It fees like the best of the old days again. All the old hands returning and more content than you can shake a stick at.

Thank you CCP.

That said, the new gen 3 ryzen CPUs are basically indistinguishable to threadrippers, while being a cheaper ecosystem.
---
It's almost like all of null's problems won't be solved with one change alone.
---
Artificial scarcity.
---
Null sec shouldn't be safe for trogs who aren't in fleet, aren't on comms, aren't using available intel scouts etc.  If you don't want to join an alliance and interact with other people or use an alt to watch gates for yourself, great.  Move to highsec.  The sheer amount of botting and safe ratting that has been going on for the last few years has made the game boring and broken the economy.  If you can't wrap your feeble mind around this very simple concept then please unsub.  You won't be missed.
---
Silly idea of a guy who aparently discovered d-scan yesterday after 100 losses lately ;) Cries of despair. Maybe lets create a concept of ship that can take out Your capsule out from station.
---
My advice... Use Windows. Linux is better for almost everything else, but when it comes to EVE, you're going to have real lag problems when switching between clients because of the input handling. And you won't realize why F1 doesn't work because secretly the client still believes you're holding down Alt, Ctrl or Shift from a moment ago in another client.
---
Last year I stole a corporation with a number of citadels. Most of them I unanchored and sold on the market, but I left up an unfitted Athanor on a desirable moon near Jita with a "for sale" sign on it, just to see if it would attract any offers. Anyway, this noob approached me and offered to buy it for 1 billion isk. 
---
I told him to send me the isk and I would transfer ownership of the Athanor. He got cold feet at this but was willing to send half now half after the transfer. So I got 500 mil. Then I tried to talk him into sending the rest but no dice. Was an entertaining convo. 
---
Not a super profitable endeavour but 500 mil isn't nothing. I take what I can get. Years ago I swore that I wouldn't do any kind of PVE or industry for isk, living exclusively off PvP, piracy, scamming, and theft. I'm not as rich as most carebears but I probably have more fun.
---
Simple farmers... been camping legacy since they moved south. It’s not hard to camp systems in a way that is nearly impossible to respond to
---
Fake news, we are all blue and friends and no one is fighting reeeeee and all that

Convergent evolution of style.

Aviator sunglasses and baseball caps are just so optimal that any civilization will eventually invent and use those designs.
---
Impossible to respond to? How
---
Glad you have fun, a lot of us old farts not playing eve to multibox-afk-grind and wallet-wank have fun too. After years in Lowsec because of either dead, botted or heavily umbrellaed sov-space we have fun in venturing around nullsec again. There is actually some skill (brain) necessary again to keep yourself safe in Nullsec. The shiverings of for example moving a dread with 2 hostile space non-docking midpoints is great. Last week I did some beltratting in hostile premium sov of -0.8 to -1.0 . For me the game has its "lost in space" feeling back ....
---
Aww poor baby...
---
They clearly instituted the blackout without worrying about balance. Ongoing test they said.
---
I for one am not looking forward to 100k who jackdaws
---
So bring a cyno inhibitor and kill the things.
---
Yes, they are called Dotlan and the In Game map. Both highly restricted.
---
Picture doesn't say anything about July.
---
That downvote was mine
---
Before, he saw that they're docked up, cause there was local to tell him so.
---
god this UI
---
You do realise that CCP is trying to force the Doughnut right?
---
Why else would they bring Blackout? it forces all the small players to group up with the Big boys.
---
We do public fleets pretty regularly.  You are definitely welcome on those.
---
Null doesn't have problems.
---
Null just has players that think it has problems.
---
My problem with null is that worthless gutless little shits only want to gank helpless targets, not fight good PvP players ... but that can only be solved by changing human beings.
---
Not a single bottle full of piss....damn casuals
---
Because they haven't declared yet.
---
Why not polarized torps? You are already *Xtra Squishy lol* (ba dum tss)  
---
^(serious question tho)
---
The title literally says "116 man corp". That is the total players in corp, yes there are many alts, obviously, but it's not going to skew the data that much unless people are dual boxing on every fleet (which doesn't happen btw, on a fleet of maybe 25 people, I'd say 22 of them are real players and 3 are alts)
---
Also we're snigg*waffe*, not snigg*erdly* and we have access to almost no "insider info". We roll wormholes and go roaming. That is basically it.
---
cyno and blackout benefiting bigger alliances (as usual), brave having no balls in scalding :p
---
They are not doing it intentionally. I introducing more engageable, riskier and rewarding ways to make isk in null should follow. But not before they unfuck sov. The doughnuts did not need to invade apace before, they need that even less now, aoy no wars will be happening.
---
I went into a T4 Abyssal site and forgot to bring extra missiles. My drones couldn't  kill the drifters fast enough. 
---
RIP https://zkillboard.com/kill/78123390/
---
they are renaming all the slave implants on sisi right now so soon™ maybe 
---
"Low-grade Slave Gamma" -&gt;	"Low-grade Amulet Gamma"
---
Human beings haven't changed much in the last 16 years but nullsec sure has. That's weird eh? 
---
Wait, game mechanics also changed in that time. And changes in game mechanics were followed by changes in player behavior in nullsec. Very strange.
---
you're also comparing the second biggest coalition vs a coalition almost half its size.
---
This along with if anyone actually threatened Legacy (test) would batphone daddy goon like they've done every timer they've won (outside of their main tz).
---
As opposed to sending in only 1 drone.
---
Aka chillin on Mykonos all summer 
---
&lt;3
---
Well looks like the year in your nick is the year you started learning about EVE. 
---
If someone with at least some brain and skills wants to camp a system, he does. If the landlord forms to remove them, they just step aside and wait till they leave again bored, than they start camping again. Unless you are a nolife neckbeard running fleets that keep gates clear 23/7 you will have camps ...
---
chairing is caring
---
Not a bad idea at all, I like that OP tied the decloaking to an actual ship instead of another structure. 
---
I envision this ship as having 2 unique bonuses: first would be the ability to combat scan cloakies (no dscanning them tho). Reasoning is getting rid of a cloaky should involve at least some effort, and combat scanning it seems the most obvious choice. Also, most cloakies are small ships, so unless perfectly skills + implants + knowing the rough position of the cloaky you usually need more than just 1 pass.
---
Second bonus would be a grid wide effect (I don't know that much about grid mechanics, a 100 / 200 km aoe effect would probably be better: aoe should be reasonably big but absolutely not system wide) to decloak cloakies, call it an EMP wave or something. 
---
I'd love for the ship to be a t2 bc in the 500-600m price range, cannot cloak, has high offensive capabilities against smaller targets (very high tracking at the very least) but not a whole lot of tank. Make it a true hunter killer, able to do its job very well but weak-ish in a fleet scenario. In my book this should provide a counterplay to afk cloaky camping, while still being counterable by an attentive pilot that can just warp away to a different safe as soon as he catches probes + ship in dscan. The ship would also find use in bigger fleets, kinda like today's HICs (which remain very specialized ships that you need, but  normally don't bring more than 1 or 2), for decloaking waterboarding sabres and scout alts sitting at pings.
---
So in wow, a warlock has the ability to teleport players(cyno) to them, they summon a stone then they plus 2 others channel magic into the stone to summon their pals.
---
Since were in the era of chaos where everything is hard I thought maybe the cyno should need additional people to channel razor entosis it to make it work.
---
Thanks for explaining what it is but I don't think EvE needs such a thing
---
ROFL - Do you even know what siege is?  
---
&gt; Didn't even try to warp :)) I mean def afk or a bot.
---
CCP, consistently and perennially underestimating the absolute intelligence and determination of its user base, has failed to put the mineral requirement for current capital / super capital ships at x100 of what it currently is. This has lead to there now being blobs of titans huddling together like bison munching grass on the open plains.
---
Seeing all of the Black Out shenanigans really makes me want to get back into the game, but I have no idea where to start. It seems like so much has changed since I've last played.
---
Really? I heard they leave shit all over the place
---
Capital production, quite a bit of production actually, needs to be massively overhauled from the ground up. Building big ships needs to require more than just the basic minerals put together into lego pieces before being built. I'm personally leaning toward pulling LP-based materials into the production of anything BC and larger, moving BS into the capital class, and adding faction specific components to everything cruiser and higher. Though I've not come to a conclusion on whether those should be like the T2 components and buildable, or be loot/site drop. *Shrug* doesn't matter too much in the whole scheme of things, but there are precisely 0 acceptable reasons it's okay for an Avatar to require the exact same materials list to build as a Punisher, just alot more of them and assembled into capital lego's first.
---
yep thats us
---
Fuck me your dumb if you assume that.. to assume makes. An ASS out of U and ME

Stop coming up with completely bollocks excuses..

---
I'm eyeballing the 3950x coming out in September for a new build.
---
Simply wrong, low power has nothing to do with the fact that cynoing into direct tether (completely irrelevant if fueled or low power) was equivalent to cynoing into a Forcefield, what was considered and punished as exploit by CCP before.
---
Whore drone
---
Depending on your budget, I'd recommend a new 3800x or 3900x, or wait until September for the 3950x. You'll need an x570 board. As far as a card? 2070 super would work very well without going into a TI card.
---
I am EU, joined ~36 hours ago. So far there've been people on comms ready and willing to go shoot stuff every time I've logged in.
---
Yeah, I warped onto a pile of moon mining procs in my ishkur last night, and just immediately noped the fuck out of that. They might have been AFK, but if they weren't that was gonna alpha me lol
---
Bought and plugged in. I figure for 150m at Biology IV it was a good deal.
---
Price. When one travels through Delve solo, you expect to be Boson'd a few times.
---
You'd be surprised how little we actually bat phone, most of the tike we do have similar goals however very little do we ever call on them for aid.

The majority of the time the imperium gets involved its for huge battles or game altering ones (See UALX)

They should've sent a poet

I missread the title as 'tonight we conquer, tomorrow we blue'

Dude, did you suffer an epileptical attack writing this? The sentence makes no sense at all and some parts look like a faceroll ...
---
Uh, I sacrificed a Retriever to Bob and ran for my life from a horde of angry Mexicans. Didn't play much last night.
---
frigate solo t3+ and cruiser t4+ may be worth it. anything with a lesser tier not worth it, cause u'll get much more going something else(plenty of options there). u'll get about 130+m/h in t4, and 250+mil/h in t5
---
The only effective response is to take over the camp(s) yourself, something larger groups are effectively incapable of doing for various reasons.
---
Farmers have the additional advantage of camping a economically worthless pipe that leads to nowhere but hostile/neutral space - convincing people to put in substantial effort to secure a place that has no real intrinsic value to them personally is extra hard.
---
Jump freighters are tech 2 ships...
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
I heard that t3+ is where the isk is at, was just curious as to what might be ahead of me.
---
Quite often there is always someone camping gates.         
---
Like you want for this to happen!        
---
Staging system is place where people **from both sides** come for a fight **because it is always something moving**.              
---
Staging systems are "content generation areas".        
---
There will be always someone afk jumping in, someone trying to save him, someone who decide to do 1337 PVP in a very expensive ship that he thinks is unbeatable.             
---
^(Like 2-3bil T3 capable of insane active tank ... that will die to alpha damage :D)                      
---
There will be always people inviting to the fleet just to warp you off from the undock or people trying to get into some staging fleet just to warp something expensive to a gate.               
---
People who hunt those that DC the moment they undocked.           
---
People camping jump gates or people trying to bubble those warping between celestials.        
---
You will find also tons of people that will just shit talk on local.
---
 I saw Killah Bee at a grocery store in Amsterdam yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.  
---
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”  
---
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.  
---
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.  
---
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.
---
So is it true that waffles is one of the most toxic organization in the game? I ve read about the racism and people getting insulted and yelled at then booted for welping a carier at a memorial.
---
We have observed new bots running Dominix hulls with 4 or more stabs.
---
That was my corp mates rorq. Naw he knew well enough it was dangerous. Outer ring is an old home and he recently came back to the game. You won't see him for some time though, RL picked up not leaving him much time to game.
---
It is
---
Also angel titan while you're at it.
---
The risk aversion I see everywhere I go, especially within TEST. Everyone cares about making more isk that they'll never actually spend on things that are fun, or go boom. If people want a theme park MMO go play wow.
---
I would also like the alt right wackos to take their nazi shit back to the dumpster. We won a war over this shit, what the fuck kind of Americans are you?
---
Averse / aversion
---
**4 entire titans**
---
Apparently, you just literally did that.
---
In most cases I assume there is a cloaky right next to me and plan for what I can do if it turns out to be true, or just accept that risk and don't bring something I can't afford to lose. Reaction time + session change + recalibration take quite a long time so it's not "literally few seconds". And it is balanced, because you can do the same. 
---
And the physics excuse is hilarious in the world of space submarines that phase through the planets at hyperlight speeds and somehow have a top speed.
---
Once you start exploring wormholes and try evicting someone. You might end up with crazy shit like this : https://zkillboard.com/kill/77640378/ .  Quick Story : he tried moving ships out and he landed in a wormhole anomaly that deals load of damage. Saw him on scan with Cloak sabre kept him bubbled in the anomaly so he could not warp out. Anomaly eventually killed him :) . Quick tip : train for interdictors , they will get you crazy pvp content.
---
As the son of a coastie, yes.
---
Though do include logistics (T1 and 2, frig and cruiser) and interceptors in that too.
---
Catalysts are great. I still remember when Frat actually fought and they would go out with super tanked bait domis or whatever. We'd just throw every goddamn newbro we could find in a catalyst, grab them with some heavy tackle, and show the newbros just how much shit a few t1 destroyers can wreck.
---
Sure he'd light, sure he'd drop his super. Or supers. He might kill a few catas. By that point the heavy tackle ship is either prepared to tank a super, or has just fucked off.
---
I mean if you're not vacationing in Mykonos son, then why shove that cock in yo mouth in the first place? :P
---
Also karishnikov and Xyriz... fuck my life blastah from the pastah :3 Love you nerds ttys :3
---
no
---
I read redline as Hedliner. Working as intended?
---
What I heard:  
---
&gt; I want to be able to out number the dude we are fighting and do not like it when that dynamic changes when they light a cyno.
---
Seems we dont agree.
---
We defang carriers in retributions all the time. HACs are pretty good too. Omen Navy would be good but fighters apply too well to MWDing cruisers without a sig reduction now.
---
You spelled keres wrong
---
&gt; We can't actually see online user count is down... God knows what metric ccp is using they say it's up.
---
They say exactly what metric they're using: Daily and Monthly active users. That metric is very different from the  concurrent logged in users we see. A single bot logged in 23/7 counts as only one player in the DAU/MAU but is equal to 160 different players logging in for a four hour session once a week in the concurrent logged in users you're looking at.
---
Given the specifics of the events going on it makes sense that one would be down while the other up. The blackout and drifter and triglavian invasions a lot of bots an AFK miners and ratters in both high and null are likely not logging in while they wait the events out driving the concurrent logged in users down. Meanwhile a lot of other players are logging in for the first time in months to fly around for a few hours to see what all the hubbub is about which is driving the DAU/MAU up.
---
I mean, can I get a rogue disappear ability then? MJD + cloak before I land?
---
Your user name is literally the Purity of Herpes.

2. Hi troll by troll.
---
NO NEW SHIPS....BALANCE WHAT WE GOT AND DO MODULE TIERICIDE... its all thats needed from the perspective of available tools....there are areas not directly related to ships that need addressing
---
You've missed my point entirely and gone off.on some random tangent
---
Nice fanfic, but lack boy love and sex scenes.
---
I must say, I like the idea. However that isn't sufficient counterplay. This idea would have to be carefully fleshed out in order to not be abusable by botters. For starters I'd say the following needs to be considered:
---
1. The ship must be locked in place (no always aligned and 2000km off the ratting VNI bullshit) while it's scanning for cloaked ships
---
2. In case of system-wide scanning being a thing then please no scanning on citadel grids (at the very least make it lose tether).
---
3. The ship cannot receive any form of remote assistance while scanning (no panic invulnerability, no reps etc.)
---
4. While scanning the ship either creates a warpable beacon or receives a massive sig-bloom.
---
5. Balance the cycle time of the scan with the ships tanking potential so that it is a reasonable target and vulnerable to ganks while it is scanning.
---
Once a waffle, always a waffle.
---
Very nice.  Now what CCP needs to do is change the EFI so that intel sites such as dot lan and zkillboard are significantly delayed.
---
This looks pretty fun actually I might give it a try.  That ceptor dunk at the start though.  Big ups.
---
\&gt;cynos in on peaceful krab 
---
\&gt;krab lights cyno of his own
---
\&gt;my point is that cynos are op
---
Love that, what did you belt rat with? Seems super dangerous.
---
Sounds like multiple subcaps to me.
---
Guess there is no waffling on that issue :P
---
CCP can't make you not a coward.
---
Do they sell that at Walmart?
---
you're right dude, I was wrong, sometimes you have to hit f2.
---
Ye they never fully went away. Alot perhaps fell off in NS but Im certain new ones are in HS as we speak. I think blackout basically just multiplied them rather than made them go away.
---
hmm.... don't want to know the details tbh ....
---
 ^(but please go on)
---
Most special edition ships that are not from Alliance Tournament are frequently re-released in events (in-game and out of game). For the pacifier through Marshal, line, you get a BPC when you get 2, 10 and 40 recruits that use your invite link and become omega. There will probably be other ways to acquire these ships in the future.
---
Not really. Multiple characters in this game are just a way to accomplish multiple tasks at once, to speed things up or maximize profit. For example, you can have 1 character in a mining ship and another in a hauler. Or 1 character in a combat ship, the other in a (cloaked) scouting ship, checking the route ahead. Or a character running a mission, while the other loots and salvages the destroyed NPC ships.
---
But any of these activities can be done by playing with other people. It's just that Eve's got this weird fascination with having multiple characters being played by the same person.
---
Then again, I can fully relate - other people are the fucking worst, so why play with them
---
I want my new Shipline in Procuttio please.
---
People will just switch to stuff you can’t far so well and larger groups will just get better at intel about farming corps.. maybe you should read up on eve history. Why do you think you have to live in a wh Gulag now? Cause you ran out of targets the other way ..
---
It is all play style dependent.  One character might be all you need to do incursions with a public group, or to do small gang pvp.  If you plan to fly anything with a jump drive, 2 is a minimum, and 3 makes more sense.
---
Posts like this make me glad that CCP has actual developers on the payroll.
---
No, as ships.
---
The cockroach is actually a ship, but prostitute is not.
---
1 super, 2 hours a day for the military index. 1,5 Rorqs maybe and 2 hours for the industrial. So yes, it can be done by 1 person.
---
Necessary? No a 2nd account is not necessary. Will a 2nd account greatly benefit you? Yes, yes it will. The urge for a 2nd account will depend on your goals and activities in the game. For some people that urge comes quickly, for others it takes a while.
---
Where did you read about racism?
---
I agree very much. Its such an ancient mechanic (the truesec system) and honestly doesnt make much sense and just complicates things.
---
&gt;So that got me thinking, still with the blackout krabs are to risk adverse, any sign of trouble batphones a couple of supers and we got to GO. 
---
&gt;Blackout didn't solve null gameplay, it's still hard to get gudfites.
---
Gee, almost like vets said would happen. The blackout is a temporary Band-Aid with no long-term solution. You're still gonna get sups and tits dropped on your head and large blocs have already turtled up under umbrellas for safety. Unless CCP deletes them from the game while we're sleeping (which I dare them to do), that's always going to be the case. CCP can't and won't nerf supers and titans much further, and if they did, it would be their death knell with mass unsubs. You can't put the Genie back in the bottle.
---
Nah, these are definitely bots. When you kill them, the pods continue to try to do the site.
---
If you finish off the rats, then a salvage bot comes in, lol, then you kill it, and then if you kill the pods, a few minutes later the pods come back.
---
you can run the Frigate Abyssal T3 with 1 single Character in a Garmur worth around 140 Mio ISK. The average income is around that 140 Mio ISK too. Take into account boosters, and your profit is around 120 Mi/hour what equals a nullsec anomaly ratting Carrier ...
---
I mean, you can definitely fuck with a carrier in a solo retri. If he's paying attention you're probably not going to kill a ton of fighters tho. Dual rep hecate can work very well for it too, or a lot of dual prop builds can tackle and kill fighters.
---
The game doesn't download all at once and instead streams and saves assets to your computer as you find them in-game. Maybe it's getting stuck loading station interiors for some reason? In the launcher you can set it to download the full client under general settings.
---
If your internet is relatively slow or unstable then it might be worth your while to download the full client when not playing anyway so as not to impact your gameplay with extra long load times between systems, undocks, etc.
---
Remove the limit of how much you can have in your hangar and in cans. Stackable BPCs. Tiericide so we dont have a million different mods. Basically, remove all the background noise in the game.

Multiple accounts are almost mandatory due to how much utility they offer.

Doesn't seem like you even know how to formulate a coherent sentence, let alone anything about this game, so let me educate you.  The "Gulags," as you call them, is nullsec in it's current state.  Thanks to the ever increasing plex inflation people have having to spend most of their time logged in grinding or mining so that they can plex their 5-10 PvE alts and one Pvp main.  WH space is a utopia where new and interesting content is literally one roll away.
---
Nope, as ships. The cockroach is a ship, so that's fine, but prostitute is not.
---
Delicious Strawberry is best 'Quafe'!
---
It's more like when you asing all alts drones to your main and then send 50 drones at once.
---
Tangentially, I'm sad that Alex Kurtzman &amp; co. are going to trample and spit all over my warm cuddly TNG memories with this new series. I hope they don't, but I don't think I'm fortunate enough to live in the one timeline where ST: Picard isn't somewhere on the "explosive diarrhea to trickly poo" spectrum.
---
You know 1dq is permacamped by 10-20 dudes 24/7 right? even Goons can't stop it
---
Sure, you can form a fleet, but the campers will just go afk for a few hours then come back.
---
Stop being retarded
---
Yikes
---
FUCKING ON FIRE MATE ITS BURNING DOWN TO THE GROUND
---
BACK
---
IN 
---
THE
---
GAME
---
&gt;The South is on fire.
---
Second largest coalition, allied to the largest coalition, fights coalition half their size and barely makes progress.
---
Sure thing mate, its on fire
---
I think there is some weird misconception thingy happening here. “Have To” is a very strong word you use as if you know what you are talking about. Maybe you should read up on some eve history...
---
You stop being retarded
---
 Stop.making excuses
---
 If they come back then you go back.. what a terrible terrible lazy excuse.
---
lmao
---
While we are at it, can we also make it so the inhib just one shots anything coming through the cyno and drops all the loot in your cargo bay for you?
---
Fun fact tho all the bitter Vets (me included) have become space dads. So Waffles is like a very active retirement club community atm where everyone is really nice to each other.
---
&gt; With the blackout, people are going to snuggle the umbrella even harder
---
&gt; worthless gutless little shits only want to gank helpless targets, not fight good PvP players  
---
u pussies wont fight our standing fleet with 10 dudes hahahaha guess u were just scared after all build some titans, cowards
---
Waiting for you bby
---
Winterco isnt half the size of legacy they are smaller but not by much
---
Just make a new set of probes that have a specific name that can scan a cloaked ship. The cloaked dude can see them and if not afk, move around. If the probes are in your cargo or fit to ship, you can't fit/activate a cloak module.
---
While the blaster fot is not new the bomber neuting out a domi is something i d like to witness.
---
there is balance asshole, it's called go back to lowsec if you can't deal with the risks of nullsec
---
your playstyle is not special, and neither are you.
---
Can you ask him what program he used to make it? Always curious when I see these
---
It all depends on you. It is a great utility to have more than one account, and considering the passive skillpoints system EVE has, people will have alts to be able to cover different ships in a smaller amount of time. Although there's still a lot of people that are only one account players.
---
It's all about finding a good community to enjoy the game with.
---
Thanks. Was quite an effort tbh.
---
when did the laws of physics allow u to pack 1000 titans into a single space station 1/100th the size
---
you are very dumb sir
---
Lol what a great answer... you seem like you have anger issues.
---
You must be one of those fat lonely keyboard whore kids with no friends...😂😂😂
---
I understand that but why aren't all capitals tech 2 ships then? I'm suggesting make an exception for super capitals that requires some tech 2 components even though they are a tech 1 one ship. I understand that that's not how blueprints have been laid out since the time tech 2 ships were introduced.
---
On talking in stations they said that even controlling for the free SP and other events they’ve seen an uptick in players or subscriptions.
---
Legacy: 39000
---
Winter: 19000
---
Okay then, its not **precisely** half the size
---
which is really weird because a lot of people also really love training new players and the one thing CCP consistently get praise on is making changes to the NPE because those changes are always deemed good.
---
some retard is going to reply with some hot take about how thats a given because the NPE is/was bad. i bet that person started after aura's voice change when the NPE became bearable.
---
Anyone downvoting this is indeed afraid of having to do work to hunt.
---
im pretty sure alphas can only go up to 5.5m sp
---
Alpha pilot showing the beta miner how it is done.
---
All those indys.. So elite! You guys have balls of steel. Ganking unarmed industrial vessels. Man... how do I apply?? I need this kind of challenge in my life.
---
Goons appear to be lifting zero fingers when Legacy are fighting Winterco.
---
Allied, huh.
---
Sounds like Waffles are back on the menu. I've been afk for a long-ass time, but I still got Waffles in my heart. Kick ass, man.
---
smells like updog in here
---
This is the way to go. Use an old server.
---
Like, if we’re being honest the current SP system isn’t sustainable really. With the current climate of games, being hard locked into waiting 6+ months to fly a ship, then when you want to swap and go into another ship of a different race and need to wait another 6+ months is kinda shit and not new player friendly at all. Something has to change, and while free SP isn’t THE solution, it at least helps alleviate some of the pains associated.
---
Doesn't change the fact that legacy is 2x the size of winter.
---
Then the NPCs in the area instantly change lock to them and alpha one.
---
what are good ships for alpha clone doing L4 security missions? I am thinking about amarr ones like abaddon simply because I like lasers.
---
Don't forget, THESE are the people CCP have decided to listen to...
---
You're dumb as fuck.  There is no such thing as titans  or stations duh in RL
---
Have you actually seen the size of a keepstar next to a titan btw?
---
There is however time space and physics.  But you are completely too stupid to understand it.  Its OK.we all have our little problems.  Clearly yours is bigger than most.  Just stop posting its painful.  Feel free to unsub too, we need to purge the village idiots
---
👍😂😂😂
---
fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
---
A super will alpha an 8nhib?
---
sources tia
---
Is this bait?
---
Weren't they in horde or goons not that long ago? I dont keep up on news but the corp sounds familiar to me
---
what's a wulfpax?
---
You're complaining about someone hot-dropping a battleship worth more than a carrier. It should do something pivotal.
---
They can't just add a ship. Even if they decided to do this, you would be looking at months to years to add it.
---
Art team alone would take months.
---
One thing to consider is that in other MMOs you need to grind EACH CHARACTER.    
---
Training in Eve is passive, so there is nothing stopping you from getting a second, specialized character trained up while you are away from the keyboard.  A character in Eve can be trained by logging in once and setting up a queue for a year out.    
---
Even if you don't multibox, having a marketing alt means that your combat character doesn't need to travel to buy things.  There are lots of uses for extra characters that do not necessarily require extra time commitment.
---
Negative. C3 would be a krab hole. We're here to pvp.
---
We have been the real Somali pirates of this game since day one. Good mechanics or bad mechanics. We will never change. Please don't join us so we can frag you :3
---
We love you all and hope to trade gfs with all of you in the future :3
---
owo whats this
---
it doesnt automate input. it just lets you switch characters with more ease.
---
So.. a ship that punishes people for tackling it? That sounds like a ship type for the player that doesn't really want the ratter to shoot back. As Mike Tyson would say "that's some puthy ath thit right there."
---
lowsec has a ton of great wormhole connections. just have to get out and scan. tons of content to be had.
---
So have someone orbit with a long point, while you brawl down the  Calceferio ship, due to their lack of tracking (ship turn rate if you can only fire in the direction you are facing), damage and tank.
---
Keep a scram on the brawl for the mjd
---
LoL, sounds like CCP's strategy!
---
Arguing with a darkness/goon miner in 2019.
---
They have a cream for that.
---
&gt; "there's no way our players are that retarded"
---
"They're still subbed. In 2019"
---
that was probably one of the funniest things i've seen in eve in a while. astero yolos the site to kill gang. top play indeed.
---
Animated login screens, I used to love watching them float across the screen when something was wrong.
---
Good God, Domi bots would be skilled into Titans by the end of the first day
---
If I had to be in any Corp other than the one I’m in now it would be waffles. They are actually trying to have fun with the game
---
Im pretty sure Alphas cant run level 4 missions anymore. As in CCP changed it so level 4s aren't available to them.
---
In the end how ever it was, Blue is just a color :)
---
Having 2 just opens up a lot of options for you without needing to count on or trust another human being.
---
But you don't really need to do any of that stuff
---
lol on dubbing this a 'war'. It's a seal clubbing.
---
it was never much of an issue for me. it forced me to stay in smaller ships, and when i started i was typically either bait or tackle when in fleets I didnt have the skill points to fly larger stuff until i had the skills to know how to fly them. the only minor complaint i have is about the maximum duration of a skill to train. i dumping all of my skilling season rewards into logi V and i still havnt touched cap skills because fuck training JDO5/JDC5.
---
then again logi 5 turns your repping skills for "pretty good" to "you dont need to worry about anything as long as your tank is bigger than their alpha", so i can understand the long train time and regarding cap skills; what i said about skillpoints versus real skill is certainly true about caps too, so i guess i just need to spend more time getting good.
---
I started upping my hunting targets by tackling asteros and a confessor last night. Using a blaster fit , 2xScram, web, armor rep, 200mm plate, AB pacifier. Primarily jumping between C13 chains atm. Glad I've come along way since using autocannon shield fit a year and a half ago and pumped I can easily take on juicer targets
---
Hahaha you are like, factually wrong on so many points.
---
That Astra has been the gift that keeps on giving.   It may not be an engineering complex, but it is a content factory.
---
Yeah, typing in a new name is an epic amount of work! LoL
---
They must set aside weeks, possibly months for it.
---
Do you have a caldari equivalent for that?
---
But you left out the part where you followed a domi to the fort and got oof'd by Praetor II's. 
---
Joking aside, I must admit I was one of the semi-afk victims. Nice work.
---
this is my one complaint about blackout. i dont get tired of pressing v and glancing at my second screen when drone ratting and watching a movie. i do get tired of BWOMMMM BWOMMMM BWOMMMM BWOMMMM BWOMMMM BWOMMMM
---
yeah it has a hull timer
---
sometimes people mention music but im not sure what they mean.
---
I just play Spotify when playing eve
---
I played for a long while with only one account and was content. Eventually I picked up a carrier in 2016. I wanted a scout to sit on the gate of the next system over and so I made an alt. I didn't plan on doing much with it, but over time opportunities and play styles opened up where I wanted to have a scout for combat in a different ship or to try out mining with more than one. Necessary? No. Useful for many things? Yes.
---
Hey grath, I was guy in local the other day who was talking abouy that PH noobship tourney, didnt get to finish my story before you left local. I was the nerd goofing off in a dual web drake while the tourney was going on. I tackled a  vagabond 80km off the gate and started screaming in local for help. You were like "is he serious?"and after some more pleading you paused the tourney, warped over in a BS and blapped him, good times, see you in space m8!
---
Now this is a nice way to harvest some salt

It's actually pretty smooth to cycle between clients if you use hotkeys. In the EVE-O documentation it describes how you can set hotkeys for each client, and you can cycle through them as fast as you can click/press.
---
Gratz!
---
My mind, body and soul belongs to you
---
also, my butthole :3
---
Can't wait :3
---
So if you were to figure out the dps of a super could you figure how many smaller ships would be needed to keep the dam up.
---
I.e. How many battleships would it take to keep up the adm?
---
Not when it's topical. Sorry you're mad
---
This but unironically
---
You are my everything &lt;3
---
I should mention that it was the board that went first. I have always suspected that it was probably heat build-up that caused it to fail but I can't prove that.  
---
I did re-use the processor/ram in a build I did for a friend and it ran fine until he replaced it a couple of years later.
---
ah shit you are right.\^\^
---
snigg =\= swigg my friend
---
We're just slow at getting our vids out (something we're improving) We've been on a whaling bend out of our C3 since early 2018, if not end of 2017. Got a lot easier after Triglavian ships came out: 10 Bhaals and some Nestors for logi was what we rolled before that. It helps we've been steadily building numbers all that time too \*hint hint wink wink\* ;)
---
If they force people attacking PI worlds to go through as painful a UI and million clicks to achieve anything like it is to set up and do PI? I'm all for it.
---
We were in PL, left, went back to lowsec to just confirm it's dead, moved to a WH and are having the time of our life.
---
Keep telling urself that 😎
---
Currently reading this through the exact same model of monitor. Can confirm it's decent.
---
Do you not see how much of a spodbrain you have to be to think that nullsec being a shooting gallery is a bad thing?  
---
Because if you don't you really, REALLY are better off mining in highsec.
---
webs and neuts completely counter trig ships. what we're seeing so far is people trying to drop a shit ton of fighters. said fighters get sig tanked.
---
fed navy comets &lt;3
---
I’d like the falcon and widow back first, please
---
Sounds like a plan to me! Rorquals are cancer and they are invulnerable, why not the inhib too?
---
Appearently there will be three more parts. So there is still hope. I hope they will not be released though.
---
What ship do you have in mind?
---
Make it to be used on cruisers, or what about a dedicated ewar ship? Maybe give the destroyer a T2 variant.
---
\*smirky smile\*
---
\*press F\*
---
No!       
---
Triglavian ewar is about modifying ship inertial - and it is AOE module.        
---
When activated it increase the align time of all ship in the vicinity  ... eat s%#@$ on gate camps insta warping ceptors!
---
This is so incredibly dumb, I wonder if you have a reminder on your phone for breathing regularly.
---
fake news \^_^
---
that is exactly what i meant.. Alphas can train to 5.5mio, after that, they could in theory have another 15mio SP that they could utilize IF they trained it.
---
Currently, they can do that only with injectors (also special injectors only for this case). But this is very costly. With giving avay SP, they have a small chance to fill the SP up without spending lots of isk
---
The event is less about giving you sp, or a non terrible event, and more about log ins unfortunately. You mistook CCP for another company with good events
---
Yo Squishy so quick question. Would you say that the vni change has helped hunters? At first I was anxious about pve moving to myrm and domi because of the larger hp pool, neuts, reps, etc. 
---
But I didn't think of bombers lol, you seem to be crushing them with ease.
---
Would you say it's doable to dual/triplebox those garmurs (in seperate sites) or does one already require to much attention in a T3?  
---
PS: Can you share that Garmur fit? :)
---
You're mixing battle-spheres there buddy. Do you want to get thargoids? Cos that's how you get thargoids.
---
TBF SP loss still exists on T3Cs.
---
That, sir, is a very fair point.
---
what's updog?
---
Trig recon.
---
so reduce the sig size? but wouldn't that would only affect carriers/supers, dreads/titans will still be able to rip through it assuming they sit still right?
---
This one is my favorite:  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78124071/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78124071/)
---
if you want to use capital ships they are basically required, if for no other reason than as a cyno, and most people recommend training capitals on an alt account. As for a secondary character on your account, just create a dude to sit in jita all day long, so you can import stuff from there to wherever you live easily. Other than both of those things, alts are not really required. You could have a secondary account to make more money with when mining or ratting, but honestly, at the price PLEX is currently, you would have to grind a ridiculous number of hours to make a profit, so it aint worth it, imo.
---
You do realize legacy and their Russian allies are at least 2x the size of frt?
---
Wars don't make progress, until they do.
---
There is already a T2 triglavian destroyer, the dragur (I think that’s how it’s spelled). But, op compared it to a sentinel/curse so probably a frig or a cruiser. Personally I like it to be a cruiser.
---
as a member of the recon group, please do tell me of the secret insider information that we have. specific facts would be dope af.
---
Did the Myrm not have reps ?!
---
Alpha clones cannot run L4 missions. If you were to upgrade to Omega state, the Apocalypse is the bread and butter of Amarr battleships for PVE, as you get extra range and tracking. Concerning the Abaddon, you can use it once you get better skills and implants concerning your capacitor, as this ship has an hard time feeding its turrets in energy. However, you'll get a ship with better damage and resistances.
---
Tsssssss... . . 
---
I . . . Like the idea. 
---
But that just seems about as prone to abuse as a lisping choirboy in a catholic school.
---
The game does not need more ewar.
---
I think falcon is fine, widow is total shit
---
trig recon and EAF
---
Maybe I should keep playing until I get to the point where I will feel that another account would be beneficial, and then analyze if I am willing to do so, my account is only 40 days old, and every day I do something different, trying to find something that suits me. 
---
For now I'm doing Sisters of EVE Epic Arc, having fun killing NPCs with Drones on my Algos, already have trained Drones to V and are able to mining with Retriever too, today i have almost 4m SP, thanks to packs and that bonus weekly.
---
haha. How about a trig weapon that at full ramp opens a gate to stain?
---
Send 2 bil to Julius Mordan, i'm pretty good at this, i'll help you trough the whole process.
---
Idk seeing as how neuts are already made for elongated fights this just seems flat out better than normal neuting ships. I don't like the idea of them having the same ewar as an existing faction either. Actually I just don't like the idea of more ewar period.
---
6 months gets you lots of ship types.  And mostly ones you can afford.  If you are getting really good, and have been around 6 months, you probably also have the opportunity to get yourself a few SP to squeeze out whatever game style you want short of BS ships and weapons (which are crap anyway right now) and caps.
---
If you really REALLY want some style of gameplay and can't wait for it you have the option to buy the SP with IRL $.  Whether people are for or against this is up to each person.  
---
I started a couple of years before it ever came available and Meta'd (non T2) those modules I needed until I was ready.
---
I think that is a very wise choice
---
&gt;and yes it can be a double edge sword but fitting also isn’t everything and it’s worth it to show achievements. 
---
So then you would support removing fitting from the killmail (you only see dropped modules)?
---
&gt;The fact that blackout hides your name from being searched in local unless they are gathering intel on gates is a huge advantage to hunters now and it’s awesome.
---
That establishes that having your name searched is a problem.
---
No PvE happening in worm holes. Hence insane t3 prices.
---
Hunters are starting to use dscan against their prey. They are ratting in a myrmidon, they won't question another myrmidon on dscan. hell one night somebody on comms was confused as to why this blue myrmidon followed him. It didn't click until he spoke up about it that that myrmidon was not a blue.
---
it's shite content mate
---
I fly 9 toons in incursions can confirm 9. Is better than 1
---
That's news to me. I can think of one instance recently -- when they gave us intel on a drop the other day -- but "every cta" is clearly not true.
---
Yes, I'm calling you a liar.
---
WTF are you even talking about?  Most WH alliances are massive carebears.  There is literally TONS of PvE happening in WH space and T3 prices are fucking crazy cheap compared to what they used to be.  What planet are you living on?
---
Wasn’t farming provi bloc somehow the promised land after almost suffocating in the dead corpse of pl? History?
---
Blops are part of the cyno problem. This shows that people just want stuff that is good for them. Balance is not considered. Your suggestion is therefore bad.
---
The solution to cynos is a 5 minute delay.
---
One thing that keeps me from having one more account, at least while I'm not self-sufficient, is the issue of paying another Omega account, I live in Brazil, and the monthly prices here due to the high dollar were almost impossible to pay. 
---
For example, in FFXIV i pay something like a US$ 8,77 (Steam helps), and EVE is US$ is 14,74... doesn't seem like a big difference to those who own a valued currency, but in Brazil it is.
---
I have this reaction, almost frustration.. at seeing the Dominix pilots trying to recall slow drones from such a distance rather than disconnect and deploy lights vs. a bomber...
---
lmao we were about to go boosh some excavators the other day. right when we got into system, a bunch of bombers bombed them all.  was super funny.
---
I take it you missed the Talking in Stations interview?
---
[https://www.talkinginstations.com/2019/07/ccp-blackout-interview/](https://www.talkinginstations.com/2019/07/ccp-blackout-interview/)
---
Have the empires pull back in light of the trig and drifter invasions. Cut the amount of hi sec systems in half. Have every empire be surrounded by low or null sec.
---
In terms of development manpower it was very minor. Not thousands of lines of code interacting with the entire code base and substantial art assets like, for example, Walking in Stations or POS replacement.
---
When you said minimal, I was expecting a pod.
---
Trig ships are already extremely strong without counting in disintegrator
---
Very low mass, high agility, good speed, good base resist, utility high bonuses
---
So how about no
---
Instead of having it be like a mission, it should be just a set amount of SP per kill....  Then they would have the numbers online they are trying to get.
---
Scorpion is a useless ship. Use a snake or a golem. The eve uni fits are terrible.
---
Welp, there you have a Shuttle!
---
Yep as long as you don’t want to play any other games :D
---
great stuff once again, appreciate the effort. very much enjoyed the commentary too and the debate over scram/web on ab only ships.
---
Then they go off and shoot some random frig rat instead of the player because i forgot to set focus fire on and i die because the ship was at 1% and that final shot from the droned would have killed him but like i said the drones go off and shoot a frig rat 32km away
---
I’m not the one defending having to retreat to wh space after failing in low sec..
---
Idk about Search and Rescue, I've always been more a fan of Search and Destroy
---
i think the issue is most players don't relate to this kind of pvp or find it too nerdy/difficult. it's unfortunate but a stationary hulltank brutix or meme solo dread is always gonna fare a lot better with reddit than intricate kiting stuff.
---
A marketer would not upload their trade secret. Less competition means easier money
---
The logi cruiser have the ambulance skins, a service themed inty skin would be kinda cool though
---
Trig ewar should replicate abyssal effects, not emulate existing.
---
I am a very new player and i was wondering if the 750k skill points i got from a referral link can be shared between my characters if i make a second character (it looks like i can have 3 characters in total)
---
Optimal range damps, jams, and burst jammers
---
yea I agree. PVPers should only fights PVPers, and PVErs should be left to do their own thing. Just like what a sandbox game is designed for.
---
Would be cool if it made a noise when there was something new on Dscan.
---
The discord link in the OP refuses to update to the new link so use this one instead: https://discord.gg/tWeMAek or animeistrash.org/eve
---
I know what I said. 
---
Keres is the best nano damp ship though
---
Abyssals have random pocket spawns, so you never know if you get the ones you can nearly afk, or the ones where you regularly get volleyed into low shield because that pocket has damn rocks in the way of your orbit around the biocache that fuck up your sig/speed-tanking. 
---
But I would require orbiting bicache at 20 as standard procedure, as in some pockets with speed boost clouds you are over 2k, and scratch the boundaries within seconds when failpiloting ..
---
4 Months after the Gate Gun is released to TQ:
---
CCP: Ok, no one has fired a single shot with one of these since it went live on TQ. But the BPC's are selling at 10.2 Bill each and rising each day. Whats going on?
---
CSM: We discussed this with our corp mates, Alliance mates Coalition mates, we talked with High Sec players Low Sec players, friends and mortal enemies and asked why they arnt using it. Weirdly they all had the same answer. "Fuck StainGuy"
---
CCP: Fair.
---
reinforced should not equal low power
---
Lol
---
90% of reddit threads (and you’re notorious for this) is “why do pve players bring fleets to help when my roaming gang engages them :( CCP NERF NULL”
---
It’s retarded.  It’s hypocritical.  And i will always call it for what it is as such
---
Anything “solo” will be going 8k/second and will shit themselves running away if you so much as fart in their direction.  So yes.  They are cowards.
---
Why are they the ones who are risk averse when you were the ones that ran away?
---
They talked a little about this during the developer Q&amp;A in Toronto. Since it will affect so few people, it's literally last priority.  It's still there, but just not being worked on atm.
---
Just skill the Gallente Frig to 4 and use the Garmur. I cannot eft-warrior at office, but I doubt a standard T1 frig gives you enough speed/dps/projection to run the site solo. But as these sites can be done with up to 3 chars, maybe there is a viable Setup of 2-3 Kestrels
---
Does anyone read the VAST majority of “invincible please nerf” threads....?  Or did me going against the circlejerk short circuit you?
---
how about they fix the only caldari ewar -or make their hulls adequate to the change- before introducing even more of them?
---
I don't know how to tell you this, but you're getting late to the party. Most alliances have its own freighter service, they don't move assets with blockade runners. Those are better used to move personal assets, or eventually you will get someone who needs to move small assets beetween short distances. Blockade runners are pretty easy to get, almost anyone who does some kind of industry in nullsec, already have one. Those ships are more suitable for lowsec, I think you will have better luck there.
---
Picard memes are best memes.
---
We just need a low mass drifter blops with a mini DD but unfortunately CCP Falcon doesn't do ship design. But yeah spooling neuts would definitely help against the capital menace, whilst being fairly shit next to neut bonused hulls like bhals and curses in normal subcap engagements.
---
PvP-Fit Cynabal or Deimos, I was literally hoping to get ambushed ... felt like 2012 living out of Curse again

Looking at raw member count is very deceptive in the Era of timezone tanked Sov warfare where both sides have small vulnerability windows that are the furthest thing from overlapping.

  From the Stats I’ve seen, both Legacy and Frat have had roughly equal numbers of participants, sitting somewhere around 10,000 each. The stagnancy or stalemate someone perceives from the lack of one group rolling through and burning another’s space quickly, is not a good metric to judge just how active the fighting has been.
---
Imagine not autistically checking r/Eve‘s „New“ 24/7, my life would be so lame
---
ECM is fine IMO, if not OP.  some of the hulls are broken like the widow and the griffin navy.
---
Hilmar says a lot of things. I'd also love to hear how exactly he knows which players kept login in for the free SP and which for the blackout. That's the kind of magical insight into your customer's minds that pretty much all company execs would sell their souls for.
---
Whatever is said, there facts are pretty simple: They released a change that was guaranteed to massively piss off a lot of players. At the same time they throw an unprecedented amount of login incentives at us. Then they claim the increased login numbers are due to the change, not the incentives...
---
I'm simply not buying it. You can't blatantly skew your metrics like that and then just shrug it off as if it doesn't matter.
---
Blops are part of the problem how?
---
I don't believe so, but more importantly you can't train multiple characters on the same account at the same time without paying extra.
---
I'm relatively new myself but what I did was just make multiple accounts (you can use same email address and everything) and then you get the 750k bonus for each account. (Use your first account as the referral for your next one. That way if you ever upgrade to omega on the second account, you'll get another bonus.)
---
Hey DAE remember when "you're not winning fast enough" wouldn't get you called out for being a moron?  Because I honestly don't.
---
You should read it yourself, especially the last bullet point. Yes they're buffing the stats but they're adding a stacking penalty, that's huge. Currently fitting a couple shield regen mods does nothing, buffing them is no big deal, might even be interesting. Where they end up becoming overpowered is when you have a full regen fit like a sigil/nereus or a wyvern, the stacking penalties will mean those fits don't get buffed ~50% by shield slaves.
---
oh that sounds very smart. i will give that a try, thank you!

Weebs 👉 🚪
---
Haha, that's probably the guys in Predditors. I had a similar laugh the other day when I was about to gank an explorer and another astero also decloaked, leading to a fun 3-way. I got my ass kicked when I ran out of cap boosters first but it was a lot of fun.
---
Gotta hit it half a dozen more time just to be sure they got the message.
---
Again, you are twice the size of winter, look at goons in tribute if you need to learn how to actually win
---
And you can still rep them, shield, armour. Have logi in fleet, it ain't hard
---
It’s definitely not as necessary as some people say it is, especially if you don’t live in wormholes. 
---
But, if you want to seriously live in wormholes, or fly capitals, then you will want an alt or two. 
---
The market alts people have are usually kept in the free to play state, so you can’t log them in without logging out your main, but that is still easier than having your main fly all the way down to Jita to go buy some stuff, since in most cases you will use a third party courier to move the stuff to your home.
---
Literally as the Kikis were in warp the neutral bombers decloaked on the excavs
---
Seems too easy tbqh. At least make people look at the game occasionally
---
Add a second ewar to Caldari ships
---
Seriously though, if you want a solution to the capital umbrella, this is probably it.
---
I think a theraboi just trolled you into caring about his bitchass opinion.
---
It's a billion isk battleship that has less ehp than some cruisers.
---
Exactly, how many have you seen dropped recently?
---
Thaaaats horseshit
---
Just buy a Loki
---
Hey thanks for the help, I'll try downloading the full client first and see if that works.
---
Y'all need stealth bombers?
---
The post was stupidly worded in a way that encourages misunderstandings.
---
Seems like your WhatsApp is outdated
---
There's a reason most people making insane amount of isks have 3+ accounts. N+1 is pretty ridiculous in eve when it comes to mining, although there is options for 1 account, most people just spread their training across multiple accounts to achieve what they want with a certain character then turn it into a skill farm.
---
It's pretty shit.
---
Introduce another ewar that counters logi, and delete ecm entirely
---
Alright, thanks for the info
---
If you don‘t want to fly capitals then you‘ll probably be ok with only one account but if you decide to fly capitals then you either need a group of trustworthy allies (corp or alliance people or real life friends) and you‘ll need to depend on them to allow you to move the capital around. 
---
You‘d also benefit from a second account if you want to be able to scout for yourself but again, corp mates or friends can also do that for you (if/when willing).
---
For all other purposes (such as a neutral trading alt to sit in a market hub) you can use the two additional character slots on your main account and work with contracts to exchange assets etc.
---
Shhhhh it's BitTorrent
---
Sick! Bomber goals.

Anything that shows when something happens, regardless of when it was posted, is near perfect information leakage for probability and predictability tracking. KM's are a tad different due to like hopefully Joe Ratter maybe died once on tuesday at 1700, if he's not dying every time thats not showing that he's always there.
---
You either need to remove it entirely (best case), fuzz it so times active can not be discerned (middle ground), or might as well leave as is as.
---
it’s not automating anything lmfao
---
They also have heavy neuts, lots of dps, and often teleport in groups of 10-20 (or realistically how many they need to ensure it is always a gank and zero risk).
---
The cyno is an overpowered and uncounterable mechanic that must be balanced. The easiest way is to add a 5 min delay.
---
You can always call me yonis. I'll be an ear for a mother in need.
---
So, you never go on vacation? You have absolutely no relatives or close friends you care about and would visit in the hospital? You don’t live in an area prone to natural disasters? You have absolutely 0 health problems that could put you in the hospital yourself? You never do anything risky at all that could get you injured?
---
Well, if that’s the case then good for you, I guess, but most of us might need to take an unexpected break every so often
---
I would put one of these in every system in Delve.  Now you are the hostile, and we get free kills.
---
This is an awful idea.
---
Wholesome hauler
---
so the last 3 times goons came to help you put down a staging fort was "game changing"... Riiight
---
Bro.  No one does this shit right now, because it's painting a giant target on your head. You're dropping 20-30bill on the field, most of which with less ehp than some cruisers.
---
The risk is definitely there.
---
It will alpha through the shield/armor and bleed structure each hit, no matter how much logi you have repping it.
---
at least most things they released didn't directly affect every ship in the game
---
This doesn't seem very pvp... seems more like ratting
---
This gives me hope to still play EVE when I have kids.
---
I don't like the army-of-alts approach either, but I have a few. It's not necessary, but some minions do become handy after a while. 
---
See them as extensions of yourself. You can't be everywhere. An Alpha in Jita to check prices eg. A hauler, a scout, PI. Don't hesitate to create them, minions are free. Treat them like ammunition, like everything in EVE.  
---
If not needed, biomass them at your leisure. I've heard the sound effects are worth it. Not done it, but going to.
---
&gt; I've never seen a corp who actively PVP 24/7... and I am very happy to be a part of it :)
---
I have, it was called 2010 Waffles
---
If you force a warp in is inconsequential. Bad fits will die, good fits will live. That's true either way. The rorqal/carrier/whatever pilot puts a fax in system and aligns as soon as you hit grid. Any cyno inhib buff you do will either be countered or disrupt warfare more than it already is. Just stop.
---
Stop
---
This is clearly the solution to all our problems. It's ideas like this that will Make PvP Great Again, if only CCP will concede the sagacity of your proposal. It's a darned shame the CSM elections are over.
---
Until the Calceferio brings his own Web/Scram/Damp alts to charge his Quantum faster so he can rip through others easily.
---
I know, right?
---
Retreat to wh space after failing in lowsec?  You're so clueless and out of touch it's insane.  I sense you are more than a little butt hurt about something.  Care to share?
---
DST would be more viable. Then, I would recommend joining a hauling corporation like PushX or Red Frog Freight and do high sec routes. Null PVPers typically have camps set up to decloak blockade runners especially on routes between those regions.
---
Also, you will need at least a billion isk in collateral typically to do these high sec shipping.
---
That clip at the end LOL
---
Gey
---
Brilliant, but not enough ... This is 'chaos', rememeber? Make them anchorable 250km off any Keepstar with a damage cap of a Fortizar and three can be anchored in any system, but only one can be online. Also, tie it to TCUs. They're worthless flagsticks that do almost nothing anyway. Attackers have to entosis an entire constellation, under cyno jammers just to RF them into another timer. Also give them timers that can be timezone tanked +2 -2 hours.
---
&gt; Just skill the Gallente Frig to 4 and use the Garmur.
---
Don't you mean Caldari frigate to 4? Caldari frig gives damage bonuses, Gallente frig gives warp scram/disruptor range.
---
That's too hardcore bro. Dunno, got to give them krabs some way to counter.
---
Link me one comment where I complain about fleets or numbers.
---
I don't know about you, but my version of Dotlan is super exclusive.  I pay £50.00 a month and it shows who is in what anoms.  I also pay an extra £100 a month for excess to Exo's wh generator.

Definitely no

Nothing say glorious combat like "Fffff1234ffff" in local chat
---
I have 80 accounts and can multibox up to 16 of them. Anything I do you can do with friends. I don't have friends so I have to multibox.
---
Jokes aside, multiboxing can be kind of its own skill intensive niche, almost its own esport. But it's not like you will be gatekeeped from certain activities if you don't multibox. You will just have to work with people, which is default in any MMO. E.g. there are WoW multiboxers doing raids alone, but typically it's a group activity.
---
I have been small gang most of my eve career, even while fling with larger entities, I roamed with smaller groups.  Blackout has been nothing but an improvement for my play style and long term I can't imagine it getting worse than before.
---
6"?
---
Seen very few bots in most of the fights we have had.
---
Thats true,  I just thought that he already has skilled Caldari when asking for a caldari alternative. But if I get it right it would be enough to skil gallente frig to 1 just for being able to board the ship. All boni needed for missiles come from Caldari skill. So Caldari Frig V + Gallente Frig I are the goto if you just want the Garmur for PvE.
---
Well maybe not for you guys. But your hole is somewhat elusive, the last time I saw it the connections were being rolled and checked by a guy who undocked every 5-10 mins. It was impressive I must say.

I think combat inti's would like to have a word with you lol.

Because Interbus is not a specialized delivery service?

Like a lot of fandoms, they'll ship just about anything.

Yeah, it's been fun fighting with brave and that night we all got into your standing fleet was a solid laugh.
---
Something else hmmm? 
---
-ESI blackout, 
---
-assett safety removal,

-swopping highsec and nullsec around making the middle a bloody arena....
---
-Deleting cynos.

-deleting the loki

Anything sound like the chaos theory?

Michael Chabon dude.  Michael Chabon. Dude can write.

I think you should start with an application ;)
---
https://discord.gg/Wvu2KzG
---
I still don't understand the purpose behind raising taxes in hisec.
---
I think maybe it's to encourage more people to use nullsec?
---
Besides that it's just consolidating the wealth back to the 1% of players who hold the trading hubs
---
farming providence to death, twice, would be a testament to our success in low sec no?
---
Regardless, how is it a retreat? Its a deployment. A restaging. IF anything, its a more offensive staging to do to null sec on a larger scale that we were doing in provi. 
---
Like I almost want people to seem to have some expertise on us to pass a waffles history exam before putting their dumbass thoughts on reddit. When did anyone say Providence was the promised land? We are a nomadic corp. ALWAYS have been. Our CEO gave a presentation at vegas a few years ago on how to be Nomadic. Moving is a constant part of our lifestyle. Calling a retreat is just retarded.
---
lmao.....explain this then? please tell me how goons is not on every fight test pings....I mean, its ok to outnumber in a fight as long its your side doing it right? lol fucking hypocrites you guys are killing the game

---
Yea, no. We just undock.
---
Are you a troll or just that stupid?
---
I found myself asking this question a lot lately...
---
this comment is dumb and shows your lack of understanding of how roaming papers work.  We get into a region we are instantly reported on intel regions and everyone within that network is already warping back to station and we burn though 20 jumps only to see everyone is already docked up. with blackout players are forced to actively pay attention and use dscan and their eyes to track pilots and their ships.
---
join waffles and see for yourself. We don't use spies to get our fights. I think we maybe have 2 in the whole of corp.
---
Hecate is pretty good for this as well.
---
NO U
---
I don't understand, how could a terrible 10km mjd counters scram and web?
---
Maybe you should fit more CPU.
---
Nope, this dude is just retarded, CCP is trying to bring the risk/reward balance back in order to keep the game alive.
---
If you only see this as an attack to your isk making activities or a "hurr durr, they want free kills reee", sorry to tell you but you are even dumber than OP.
---
Yeah, I'll make a discord and IGC. See if we can make it grow.
---
"Why aren't you as autistic with thousands of Titans like Goons? Such BADS"
---
Also, unlike NC, Winter Co undocks, and Legacy is more interested in fights than "glassing" with titan blobs. If Legacy can win a war without having to ruin the game to do it, more power to them.
---
A well FC’s Stuka fleet can fight HACs and win. It can easily stay on grid with dozens of supers and still get kills, either on faxes or seized dreads. OP is either incredibly bad
---
If your character has horrible skills, use Gila
---
Even if your character has good skills, still use Gila
---
Quick ballpark recommendations.
---
Ryzen 3 3700X or 3900X depending on budget.
---
3950X if you want to go all out.
---
Beefy air-cooler for some decent overclocking. NH-15D is never a bad choice if you can fit it.
---
Make sure the case has really good ventilation as well. 
---
Can't give specific case or motherboard recommendations right now.
---
But I wouldn't cheap out on the motherboard, especially when it comes to power delivery circuitry.
---
32GB ram minimum, more is better.
---
Try to go for 3200mhz min.
---
3400mhz or better recommended
---
GPU of your choice and budget, 5700XT is a good choice. Or equivalent/better Nvidia if you like their stuff.
---
I do some abyssal PvP once in awhile and run T3s to check for the gate. I don't even bother looting the cans because they've been so bad.
---
My gameplay has greatly improved since the blackout and I'm just a casual player too.
---
The risk is not there. But this is really about you not wanting people dropping overpowered stuff on you, but when you do it, it is fine. Hypocrisy.
---
You want to balance the game based on something that doesnt happen very often. Why would that be good?
---
Alts are overrated. Single box can make tons of money and have good impact on fights. Don't feel obligated to get one. Enjoy the game as it is and if you feel like you'd rather be doing two things at once then get one, based on what you said I doubt you will.
---
Oh man, yeah. you are right. looks like [we never fight anything but industrials.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKmwiqha4tLJ7jjrJ9ZblNg/videos)  We must be total shit tier guys.  Time to quit game and rethink our lives....]
---
Catalyst please, for obvious reasons.
---
Rifter also needs a police skin, but with the rust coming through. Detroit style, you know what I mean.
---
Also, proteus, nemesis desperately need police skins. Thorax needs them publicly available.
---
Honestly man the CNI is bad at everything, 9 times outa 10 your better off with a regular caracal. Sutonia has great guide for running abyssal sites in a caracal. Here's the link https://youtu.be/DEgThIUyfOA
---
Is this an eveonion article?
---
Nah. Frigates, especially combat interceptors, need mad max POLICE INTERCEPTOR on the side.
---
Dude, your ideas are just bad. Like, really bad. There's nothing constructive I can give with the criticism.
---
ESI delay would be nice, Asset safety removal (at least in null, partially in lowsec) would be fucking fantastic.
---
But don't you dare touching muh loki.
---
Delve is filled with Goons
---
Dont you dare go there
---
Why not just ask the zkill board admin to give you kills on there?
---
It’s basically the level of effort you want
---
Do it the horde way(probably a well know way anyway). Three people in kestrels if you low sp gets you t1/2. Then hookbills for t3 three man. Then hawks for t5 three man, they can also solo t1/2 and 3 in good skills. 
---
Doing three man t5s is a lot of fun with two corp buddies making 200 to 300m a hour each. You can multi box it if you really want to be anti social but that come with a much higher apm and is just not as fun.
---
You can also solo all electric's in a retribution but the pods and ship for that get real expensive.
---
That was SO manly to not jump out when you lost your armour, good call!
---
So what mostly works on everything got it.
---
That and when the average eve player has at least 3 accounts.
---
You don't see fleets of 30,000+ fighting one another, EvE doesn't even have that many people regularly logged in concurrently. You see maybe 200-400 on any given side of a bigger engagement. The vast majority of those member numbers in either coalition are alts, long-term AFKs, or non-combattants.
---
I'm wondering if OP assumes the jump to be scram-immune, balanced by the fact that a projection of the ship appears at its destination.
---
He specified it cannot be activated if scrammed
---
Link the place where I said no breaks are possible or allowed. Put your strawman back in the closet. 
---
What I said in the post you replied to (it was actually a question) is that you shouldn't expect favorable treatment because you're casual.
---
Perhaps you meant to reply a couple levels higher?
---
You are stupid.  I KNOW exactly how roaming pvp works because WE used to ALWAYS do 50-100 man roaming gangs on a daily basis a few years ago.  You know what we had Intel then, hey guess what we had local then and guess what else.  We had great fights and lots of fun..
---
You know why?
---
Because every fucker also had a roaming gang, or guess what they would know we was coming and guess what we wanted them to know.. you know why? Because we all loved Good fights.   Win or lose... people would form gangs purposely hoping others would.
---
Now all you lot do is tun away scared and dock up.. because your either scared of your shit KB stats or scared you'll lose a little ship
---
Because quite frankly eve has moved from pvp to pve  mindset
---
However the game hasn't stopped that the players have dumbass.  Dont try educate me silly boy
---
Wait.... There's stuff in the cache? What do you keep in there? Probe launcher and probes seems most likely but curious. I see them all the time in dscan but never sent to one
---
&gt;But your hole is somewhat elusive
---
Elusive? We scan out massive chains and never roll until we're sure it's dead. We're not that hard to find. 
---
And yea we have stupid fast scanners. It's one of the pros of just not rage rolling, peeking out your static, and then rolling
---
And there it is this is the point where this conversation is pointless.  As soon as you start talking about people being butt hurt you completely negate your talking point.
---
link your losses to these 50 gate camps tia
---
"Lemme just turn off and on the system wide cyno inhib real quick, those dino brains wont know what hit them"
---
Trig ewar should add stacks of RR modifiers onto ships so actual incoming reps are diminished. Would play well into their smaller fleet size theme and longer focus on single target weapons.
---
I mean you were 80:1 and I disagree with your complaint regarding this scenario, but you're right, cynos and panic need a nerf. Removal of the latter actually.
---
Oh...then yeah, wtf is the point? Weapons that reduce target speed don't seem that different from webs, either, excepting the need to reload and the ability to adjust for range somewhat.
---
Right now know do not worry about it at all, play your way. Though in the future if your hooked on this game you will. Biggest reason is capitals. They have to jump to a player with a active cyno module, you 100% want that other player to be a alt.
---
This is one of the reasons the game has last names, name your characters with the same naming convention so people know it is you.
---
I can’t believe I missed this post by an entire hour
---
Phenoms were introduced when they got rid of off-grid-links, previously links used to be a module you could activate from anywhere in system. Titans worked the same way but passively - each titan had a bonus (similar to what they do now) and if you were in fleet you just automagically got more ehp/whatever. Off-grid-links were very computationally expensive and so CCP decided to nuke that, going for on-grid/active-gameplay version we have today.
---
Since titan links were a big part of owning a titan (in big fights titans would sit in a POS to provide the bonus to their fleet) they needed to do "something", and since it couldn't be off-grid it had to be on-grid/active. During this change they decided to make it also provide some drawbacks because I guess "game balance" or some bullshit.
---
Talking in stations was what made it seem likely more changes were going to be coming faster.  But it doesn't tell you which changes.  While it might have been a possible implied change, nothing in that interview implied a huge tax change was coming.
---
I'd already have applied if I wasn't a part of NJED for years. 
---
But y'all are pretty much my first choice if I ever move house.

Damn, shit's heating up in the south!

Careful.  People said the same about the Proteus.

Look into Shadow.Tech gaming Virtual box's. Only good if you have a decent internet connection however.

the first t3 i skilled into was the legion because i didnt know its trash
---
then i skilled into the proteus because it was the meta but i never sat in one because 2poor.
---
now those are the only t3ds i can sit in
---
send help
---
That explains a lot
---
Yup. You dont need some weird arcane strategy to beat them. 
---
Now a critical mass of them? That's different. But that many of any 1 ship is going to be rediculous anyway.
---
Do y'all have a public lounge room yet? Or just the recruitment channel?
---
BECAUSE ITS NOT FUCKING THERE!
---
Why don’t you just come out and say what you really want! You want pve players to warp to you and line up in an orderly fashion so u can shoot them for easy kills. “Make pvp great again” just means make pvp easy
---
It's funny, when Lasker approached me about this interview I expected it to primarily end up about cloaky solo PVP, but we quickly ended up talking more about corporation management. 
---
I'm kind of glad because it's honestly the most challenging aspect of anything I've done in this game. And I've certainly made more than a handful of mistakes. But it's something I've learned so much from, even to the extent of applying those lessons to my real life career.
---
It’s intended as a global ISK sink.
---
Right now, there’s loads of ISK entering the economy from ratting bounties, and that ISK needs to leave the economy or else more inflation will occur.
---
Look, its one of the eve servers!
---
Same with i00 when hoard was in bwf, that was constantly peram-camped by clocky goons. It is just normal for the most part.
---
High transaction costs create friction in trading.  That means more transactions will be for use or based on longer term speculation, but not just to profit on some small daily movements.
---
You might trade for a 1% or 0.5% gain if your costs are 0.1 or 0.2%.  If the cost is 3-5% you won't trade unless the gain is going to be much greater, which is less likely over short time periods.
---
The same can be seen in real life.  Transaction costs dropped for real life stock markets because of automation, decimalization, and banks having their own trading desks to bypass the stock market "floors" with their specialists.  The low costs meant low friction and voila, Daytrading was invented.
---

how profitable is ratting in nulls as alpha? and what ship for it? I guess BS will be the best, but what exactly?
---
Oh god
---
I don't want to play in 1st person
---
Allow me to introduce you to ECM and dampers.
---
And yeah, it is also a bigger isk sink if people do trade.  Though I think the higher amounts will mean much lower traded volumes on the big ticket, high volume, items (PLEX, injectors).  
---
I don't think the taxes from the amount of isk that will sink from Jita purchases will overcome the amount no longer sunk because volumes of big ticket items will slow.
---
500 PLEX traded is 1.75 bil.  That is worth almost as much as all the Medium Core Shield Extenders sold in a whole day (probably the single most popular rig sold).
---
For real with this guy. Every doctrine we have can get that kind of range. Most small gang groups are similar.
---
Pfft, we all know Jeff jacked Sphere on his way out of PL. You can't lie to us!
---
Questions about Caracal Navy Issue can be anwered with:
---
No. It is a bad ship.
---
For abyss running it is even worse than normal Caracal. The caracal gets useful range bonus that allows it to kite all the enemies. Meanwhile the CNI replaces the range bonus with an application bonus which is useless for rapid lights (which you would use in abyss).
---
They aren't used, because why drop a blops when you could just drop a carrier?  Or twenty?
---
Yeah it's poo... My prot skills are all 5 and I have all others at 4... But I'm stuck with the prot now since im too poor to get the others too

I check r/eve to see who pours out salt, creates a huge IQuit post, then one week later talks about how much fun ganking that covetor last night was
---
I have 3 clones. Main, neutral hauler, cap pilot. But I only got the last one cuz my main has enough shit to train without worrying about cap shit and I just wanted in on the occasional capital fights. The hauler only cuz I keep a negative sec status on my main and its easier than trying to move big shit with the cops tryna kill me
---
So going with numbers is the answer huh?
---
just looked for something that I can fly solo to make some decent isk while not relying on others, well too bad, thanks for the advice tho

this has been one of my favorite byproducts. stalking things for any sort of extended period and you are likely to get front row seats on a national geographic show. seeing hunters drop before you is awesome and hilarious.
---
Im talking a good year ago when I last found it via a frig hole from a C6, I'm guessing you guys were out on a long op because all your holes were critted and there was a carrier dropped on the frig hole.
---
Nicely done Lasker!  I knew Chessur was a big influence on Chance but didn't realize that he was actually in WDS for a short time. I think this interview gives some nice insight into our corp for people who may be unfamiliar or even new members of ours.
---
I also just want to say I really enjoy your videos.  Watching you take on fleets solo is a rush to watch.  Keep up the good work!
---
Never even played this fucking game but Ive checked in on you nerds about every 2 hours or so for the last... 6 years?
---
EVE community is more interesting than A N Y other game community so like, I keep coming back. I'll browse the sub for whatever game I'm playing at the time but, I always come and check out what's going on in EVE afterwards.

AAR: we were in i-9 fighting over nodes for the SY-UWN system in subcaps, winterco warped in carriers to assist their subs, we warped a small fleet of dreads, started to melt carriers, they turned off the cyno jammer to dreadbomb our dreads, cynos were lit, we dropped dreads, then Vily said fuck it supers and titans log in and jump, winter co caps got dumpstered, their subcaps docked gf. SY- ihub is currently being captured by XIX.
---
+1 nice video dude. Glad y'all are having fun out there!
---
They aren't just releasing shield slaves. They're also going to have to figure out balance for every ship that uses shield regen along with the potential meme regen fits that could spring up
---
***If*** they're going to add an ewar platform for the trig ships, it needs to be something completely new and unique to the race. Otherwise it just muddies the specializations of the other races. Neuting platforms are already built for slower paced, longer fights as is.
---
Who needs SRP when yer not gonna die? :)
---
Isn't that exactly the same as their ramping damage? As the damage goes up, the incoming reps are less effective.
---
Having been in wingspan for a brief period, and not shy with criticisms of the corp, there are two things Wingspan is hands down at better than every other corp I've really seen: Not caring what people think, and marketing. Pretty short interview but an interesting peek nonetheless.
---
Shout-out to Confessions of a Stealth Bomber Killer, still getting people into Eve I bet.
---
I'm not trying to be mean, but I don't know who that is.
---
Why a download link?
---
You are going to get a lot of  "yes" answers but those that are saying "it depends on what you want to do" are correct. 
---
I have multiple (free) alpha accounts that I created due to being told I would need them and aside from a HS war alt and a HS gank alt on those alpha accounts, I've never used them (and those only once or twice). 
---
I don't fly caps (or have any interest in it), i dont really PVE (i have a job and can fund my account with real dollars if I needed to supplement SRP). I love small gang stuff which is mostly smaller ships. Love flying Assault Frigs and other types of roaming/tackle. Aside from my subcap main, I have a market alt and a PI alt (that i often let sit idle for months) on my main account. 
---
I keep trying to come up with another alt i want to try (would just fund it with $$) and never pull the trigger due to not having anything i really want to do that I can't with my main. 
---
So don't let anyone tell you what you have to have to have fun. Just play and see what works for you and what activities y ou enjoy.
---
Time for Legion supremacy mwahahaha
---
That'd be cute. Ramp the negatives and benefits of abyss sites? Maybe you'd have to change the benefits to not have some of them be garbage to counter it.
---
It honestly depends what you want to do. If you're afk or semi-afk stuff like mining, multi-boxing helps to increase profits. However if you're doing combat related stuff like killing pirates or running lvl4 missions, you want to make sure you don't lose your ships.
---
I have 3 caps and only a single omega account. If i need it moved, i ask a corpmate for a cyno, or fit warpcore stabs and gate it where I want...
---
its not hard.
---
However, an alpha to sit in jita and buy stuff and another to haul is nice to have when in FW like I am...
---
That explosive armor resist hole is no joke, boys.
---
Heart Strings pulled.

Oh god not another nanofag
---
Why should something be "dropped" at all?
---
Screwed up my link =/. Fixed.  
---
I'm still not sure how to get an imgur link to directly show on the post though.
---
Edit: figured it out.
---
I hope you are displaced from this Reddit
---
Sounds even more like a Providence / Ark to me.
---
Looks like a capsized vessel.
---
completely agree also u shouldn't be able to see ships further than 10km even if there on grid once u lock them u can see them any distance tho
---
That's fuckin hot brilliant shit rite ther.
---
Sure. But you're not going to delete capital dropping.  And you can't viable kill a carrier group with kitchen sink.
---
You can, however, absolutely kill blops with kitchen sink.  Ergo, blops could prevent hot dropping and allow for more small gang encounters to transpire.
---
Better than the Gallente beer-bottle opener.
---
"Lost point! Better get a scram." on a phoon that's moving 0 m/s lol. 
---
cool video though.
---
I mean, who would jump on a "ratting" cynabal unless you had a Huginn or something.
---
AAR: I'm a dumb dino and i call init and goons to do my job because MEEEEH to many spod in my brain
---
So the bad news is, those groups already have way more logistics than you can offer. 
---
The good news is, there are.plentu of small low/wh corps who would appreciate someone to keep the warehouse stocked. Try looking among those groups.
---
I mean you saw their official post. Everyone who said they were canceling because of blackout flat out didnt.
---
Dont need spies, need connections. Of which Im absolutely certain you guys have. 
---
But thats honestly irrelevant, its one corp amongst tens of thousands. You having fun says nothing about how good/bad blackout is. 
---
And Im fairly certain no one said WHs wouldnt have more fun initially, but rather long term. Like longer than 2-3 weeks time.
---
there was SRP, rens fucked up the ping XD
---
This is the Caldari can opener
---
Make another just in case. You'll thank yourself later. Just don't forget to keep it's skill queue loaded.
---
Cloud ring is a beautiful spot
---
&gt;Mobile PVP Enhancer.
---
You drive a hummer. Admit it. ;)
---
We'll, CCP hasn't added any non solo PVE in nullsec that's not mining
---
I'd love if CCP just ported incursion sites over directly, and you run them in 8BS 2 logi or whatever. You can even make the entire site warp disrupted until cleared so you can't warp out and have to fight.
---
&gt;If you get groups to spread out, both in terms of geography and politically in game you created opportunities for the smaller groups to challenge the subdivided bloc.
---
Have you heard of this game called Eve?  You might want to try playing it sometime.
---
IOW, your statement here demonstrates a complete and utter lack of familiarity with how large blocs in null currently operate.  The standing fleet isn't the war fleet.  Your small group starts "challenging" a bloc, it isn't the standing fleet that fights them.  The war fleet deploys and crushes them.
---
&gt;Is this full proof, no. It does however create more barriers that larger groups have to overcome in order to remain dominant.
---
We regularly deploy about 5-6 Titan/super jumps from home for war.  Deploying 1-2 Titan/super jumps would be extremely easy.
---
&gt;An alliance has a boat load of wealth, okay send the NPCs to invade their space/RF their structures.
---
As I said above, you just split the in-game alliance to avoid this.  Goonswarm Alliance 1 through 47 can easily use out-of-game tools to remain as a coherent group, while Eve considers them 47 different alliances.
---
&gt;It isn't that big of a step to create a controller ai that works out what groups are working together
---
So.....you think CCP who has trouble removing the POS code is suddenly going to develop accurate artificial intelligence that can figure out if someone is temp-blue or really-blue.  What from CCP's history makes you think they could pull this off when they literally can't maintain their own codebase?
---
Also, the Drifter attacks would be a version of this, and all it did was annoy a small group within the blocs who had citadel gunner rights.  You'd basically need to deploy CONCORD to null, and once you something that heavy-handed, people are going to leave in droves.
---
you should play :)
---
Rage pings were sent... i missed clicking the SRP button lol Opps....
---
Cynos are already killing small gang. You cant commit to a lot of fights.
---
Have they ever brought back a SKIN that left the NES store?  Serious question.
---
We caught and killed a spy and got to mock him in voice while holding his pod. Kick from Corp, blew his pod, then rolled our hole. Bye~
---
😂
---
No u
---
The only reason people recommend ratting in null is the lack of active input. Don't be fooled, there are MANY better things to do, including exploration, wormholes, triglavian conduits, trig invasions, DED sites, salvaging in FW space, farming clone soldier tags, etc. Don't fall into the trap of ratting in null. If you do, however, you'll have to be blue to the alliance whose space you're ratting in, or you can expect to get hunted. Drone boats like the myrmidon and domi would be best.
---
Very true. 
---
They were also very good at being a facilitator of content but also not hating on people who enjoyed solo activities.  Most people were on the look out for something to do for everyone.  
---
Things moved effortlessly from 20 guys off doing their own thing, then 15 coming together for some interesting, and 20 min later flying apart again.  While there was always some people that enjoyed being the FC, it was very common for lots of people to jump into that role when they called the group together.  This kind of distributed FCing really offloaded the work I think and was pretty specific to my time at WingSpan.  
---
Maybe it’s different now, but that was my memory from back in the day.
---
&gt;If Legacy can win a war without having to ruin the game to do it
---
we should actively try to ruin the game to force the developers to fix the loopholes and exploits within it, so it can finally be a fun game
---
Can we still report for spam even if OP is effortposting and it's just a constant stream of bad?
---
&gt;Worst case scenario *in a real program*.
---
Oh, so you've decided to unilaterally redefine "worst case scenario" to be something else.
---
I think we should redefine blue to a different color.  How about "ultra-red"?
---
&gt;I understand what "up to" means
---
No, you don't.  Because you keep insisting on it must always be "realistic".  Up to does not have anything to do with realistic.  It's the absolute maximum.
---
&gt;I just think your usage of it is horrendous and you're only using it because you need to be THAT GUY trying to defend their bullshit fearmongering about 64-bit
---
Did you notice that I'm a different person than the one claiming it's always double?  'Cause here you assume we're the same person.  I'm not fear-mongering, I'm stating that the worst case scenario is double.
---
I never addressed "realistic" because there's no way to define "realistic" with any sort of accuracy.  That's why the word "realistic" does not appear in my replies until this one.
---
Is 20% realistic?  30%?  It depends heavily on how the program was written, so there's no way for us to say "64-bit uses \_\_\_% more memory" without recompiling that particular program and seeing the result.
---
&gt;You are simply wrong, and don't want to admit it so you hide behind the trump card "up to" like a sleazy used car salesman.
---
Projection is a terrible thing.
---
Blops are countered by small gang.
---
It will be even better with 3d wormhole models!
---
Ah, so that's where it is. I don't go to nullsec often, but I'll look forward to checking out cloud ring one day.
---
This. It was the most fun I had in Eve. No drama, no politics, just fun.
---
Indeed! I'm quite excited for that so-called feature creep.
---
Not sure how it is now, but the main problems I ran into was people only wanting easy content and thinking more isk=better fit. Explo frigs, only going 1-3 jumps outside of jita/Amarr to camp HS holes, spaghetti if *anything* besides the intended target showed up, and creepy hero worship. 
---
"How do I fit a loki to catch stabbed explorers?"
---
*Thanks*, Obama.
---
Fine. You're technically correct, but not in any practical or meaningful way. Are you happy now?
---
Nobody will ever once in their entire life see a 64-bit app use anything remotely approaching double the memory, but sure, if you deliberately create a program to create a worst case scenario, sure, it could happen. But that's hilariously irrelevant.
---
You don't kill sleepers with auto targeting. 
---
If you try, post your loss mail.
---
DPS doesnt matter that much. Isk is relevant, 2 hours worth of superratting is roughly 600m. Thats like maybe 10-12 old VNIs. Dunno how much battleships make tho. Lets say 70-80m so about 8 maybe. Give or take, but that ofc depends on the truesec and the amount of faction/dread spawns.
---
These numbers are however for 1 hour. So you can prob do it with 1 BS and 8 hours for instance or 2 for 4 and so on.
---
"There's a hole in this fence where I can stick my dick in, I should stick it in so that they fix the hole."
---
The most complex thing about supercaps was the requirement to have sov. If you want more varied construction then you should look into making upwell structures. They do require large quantities of PI in addition to materials
---
So much effort for so less value ..
---
I was more getting at, if youre in nullsec your group should be able to help you do things. If you have a group and still choose to scout gates or whatever alone then whats the point, you dont need to do those things solo by any means, so sure theyre dangerous.
---
No matter what my thoughts and opinions are about WDS, it takes a lot of hard work and dedication to run a successful corporation for 5 years now.
---
Good work, Chance!
---
No. It's the next swing in Hilmar's manic depression high and we're here giving him ideas to post on his Twitter.
---
Nah iamverysmart I warpout once yellow boxed
---
This isn't particularly true. CNI is great with Heavies or HAMs in T3s because of the application bonus.
---
5 minutes later:
---
STOP EXPLODING YOU COWARDS!
---
Please stop ruining their narrative
---
Someone should make shuttle model bottle openers...
---
Or even just have special "trig boosts" that apply abyssal effects to fleetmates in range. (obviously this would have to be balanced otherwise lol dark sites)
---
Mostly, it additionally has the effect of not impacting active or passive/buffer local tanks. Also, the effect would apply to all DPS being applied to the target even from non-trig ships.
---
Blessed waffles.
---
its usually the ISP that is the problem.
---
Bad routing on their end is usually what happens. Call them and let them check with websites that you know dont work for you.
---
I don't have experience in cruiser sites but doing frigs in t3 you can make 100m+ per hr t2 I think it's around 50m/hr. I usually get around 20~30m per site in t3s, with a 50m+ site around every hour. T2 is around 10m per site, but I have less experience in t2s.
---
Ships didn't drop from stations in null.  I wouldn't hold my breath for asset safety to go away.
---
Litteraly my idea, maybe also a future project of mine, I will see...
---
I was there.
---
Thanks man, glad you enjoyed!
---
I didnt read the first thread, reading halfway through this one I think I should have trusted my instincts.
---
As someone who's managing a corporation now, it's a topic that is near and dear to my heart.
---
I like it when Hilmar's high.
---
How is a bot going to tell friend from foe on dscan? I can copy ship name, broken bot. I can reship to a white listed ship, broken bot. And no, nullsec still gets fights that aren't blobs, camps, or ganks.
---
Id buy one...
---
I ain't squishy but I can tell you from experience that hunting ratters in null in a single bomber is viable now due to the meta shift and if your into the whole slower more delicate type of hunting then it is amazing.
---
Did u guys rly batphone init and goons?
---
Mobile ani cloaky camper device - once online it Will prewent any ship with any cloaky device and co op cyno to get in to system if there are any already in space it will uncloack them and imobileze them untill Will be shooted or log off

They have reps but bombers destroy em
---
It's just mood swings, not actual drugs.
---
About 3 days after I joined wingspan I found a ratting Phoenix in a wormhole...quickly got a fleet together with help from older members, then they tried to get me to FC the fleet. Mind you I had just started playing after several years off and only a few months of actual play time. So yes, the FC role is still easily passed around.
---
Look, another crybaby satire post about the current changes in Eve.
---
So between warping out every minute or so, travel time for missiles, inability to focus fire or choose targets, no drone damage to help with frigates, and a fit I can only assume is absolutely crippled in order to do nothing but spit out FoF missiles from 380km away...
---
You're wasting your time, dude. Running sites is going to take *far* longer, and in doing so you're exposing a ship which is utterly defenseless to people like myself, who will just show up and lock you down without a care in the world, because you can't pick your target to shoot back effectively, your tank and utility, and I'll bet damage are going to be absolute garbage, and you don't even have the threat of sleepers close by shooting at hunters to make them think twice about killing you. 
---
You are literally inviting a loss mail in order to rat in the most ineffecient way possible.
---
Sylnn no offense but your predisposition for judging other players shows here and elsewhere and is probably one of the main reasons you didn't end up feeling like you fit in the corp. As far as I am concerned:
---
* It doesn't matter what other people fly
---
* It doesn't matter where other people camp
---
* It doesn't matter if someone does or doesn't have "honor" to engage a certain target
---
WINGSPAN is about EVE Online being a fun, causal video game. There are no stakes, no goals, and no penalties to losing. Just flying around cloaked, shooting stuff, and writing stupid mails.
---
I'll admit some people have gone overboard with the creepy fanboy thing, but most of them burn out when they realize my schedule is too erratic to glom onto.
---
You don't see a problem with single account players/no caps players not being able to move through null without pestering people for Intel that might not even be available?
---
I can get around nullsec gatecampa just fine, with the plethora of Ansiblex, and being able to use a ceptors to bring a cyno to any station I want. For people who are single Omega/no caps yet moving around is a massive pain even with Intel channels. Cloaked doctors don't show up in local or Dscan.
---
CNI is a garbage ship it’s literally not good at anything
---
There is always a better choice than a CNI
---
wasn't it for the MJD?
---
Looks like you're right. I tested a little more and the site works on data on my phone but doesn't work when my phone is connected to the internet. 
---
Thanks a lot for the help!
---
Look at the active numbers for the weekend before blackout and the weekend of blackout. There is a 2k drop for concurrent logins. 
---
Regardless of what CCP says, numbers did objectively drop during blackout, despite the free sp. Without the sp it would have been worse
---
Init. happened to be in the same constellation running a GOKU/bomber fleet... as far as i know no assistance was requested or pinged.. but Init was temp blue or do not shoot during the fight.
---
No I'm just a dumbass nevermind.
---
Ive always been a single account player so I understand plenty, and I frankly I dont think you're even talking about the same thing anymore so I dont see your point at all, no.
---
EvE is basically a spectator sport for me. I try to keep track of it because it makes the best stories.
---
Never ever get attached to a ship. They are ammo for content, nothing more. :)
---
Every Kill mail is a lesson and while something like an Astero might look expensive right now, it pays for itself doing exploration in very little time.
---
&gt;small-scale nullsec groups start feeling the burnout from the survival-mode ADM grinding, I have a feeling the numbers will change rather drastically.
---
Can you share the names of these small scale groups please? I'm pretty sure the one living in your back yard, TRC, is doing just fine.
---
Absolutely!  No drama or politics.  People supportive of new players (crap 90% of the people in the Corp were just brand new).   Maybe that was the reason they were so inclusive, because only a couple people really had a clue about what we were doing. :-)
---
It really was a lot of fun and still makes me smile.  Don’t get me wrong, I love the people I am flying with now and have enjoyed exploring the current super capital heavy fleet meta, but hunting in WHs with the WingSpan crew and solo really really did have its charm.  Very low key and self directed content.  Good times.  
---
Having no home also had its charms.  I still have SBs all over New Eden and in Thera from that time. :-)
---
Init definitely shot our entosis.  They mostly focused on frat and didn't engage our fleets, but they weren't blue in any sense either.  More like a two and a half party.
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78138576/
---
The other day they cost us an ihub reinforce.
---
Bought 10 frigates.  Lost 10 frigates.  I suck at PvP, but it's one of the things I love, and I'm 10 ships closer to getting my first kill.  (One day...)

Eve is truly beautiful. The lightning, the nebula, the feels... [I made a desktop wallpaper version.](https://i.imgur.com/VYw5cFj.png)

Pulse lasers think you're dumb

They fell from POS structures though. Which is what Upwell replaced.
---
He is doing it the Mittani way.
---
Yeah but how do you fit a gila with bad skills?
---
Trigs already have racial ewar, it's called death and it reduces target dps by 100% in exchange for reducing their signature radius by 100%.
---
dude wtf are you talking about? We don't have "connections". That get *any* of our kills from our WH.
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKmwiqha4tLJ7jjrJ9ZblNg/videos
---
^ there is a youtube channel that is RAW footage of a bunch of our content. We have no FC comms or anything. everything you hear is everthing that is said. Watch it and educate yourself before you go spewing tinfoil hat bullshit.
---
We worked for these kills just like *any* 116 corp could or can. Don't discredit us just because of some tin foil hat bullshit.
---
I usually remember to log in and add to my skill queue after seeing x-amount of /eve threads
---
Yeah, I'm not under the illusion that I'm not a shithead a fair amount of the time. "It doesn't matter..." about really anything wasn't my favorite foundation for a corp. But the plus side is it's much more accepting of new players and those looking to dabble and learn instead of buy doctrine ships and listen to an FC. I didn't mean my other post to come off as a dig or anything, sorry if it did.
---
&gt;territory battles, strategy, planning
---
The only strategy in today's sov wars is bringing more dudes.
---
this reads as "Hi am ganker, am sad that there is risk to the reward of ganking big thing, please make it safe for me to gank, yours sincerely man who hates challenges"  
---
edit: i should not post on reddit after drinking. I'm now 100% behind this totally fair and balanced proposal please daddy hilmar this is all the support you need. more broken mechanics please give chaos
---
Yeah...  
---
\&gt;Avree
---
Lol.  Yes.  Being thrown into the FC role was crazy fun.  There was usually someone to help you out, but the stakes were usually so low and people relaxed that if you totally screwed up, no one was really going to mind.  If there were people that did mind, they tended not to last long.  
---
I still think that WingSpan was one of the best ‘new player’ corps out there at the time.
---
The general assumption in WDS is that whoever finds a customer will have the most knowledge about what's going on in the system, the connecting wormhole chain, any associated risks or backup, and likelihood of a target's knowledge of system intrusion via d-scan or other giveaways.
---
We also know a LOT of times, eager agents can dogpile into a situation without fully understanding it and in so doing ruin the delivery for the person who found it.
---
The content finder is therefore the default FC in all situations unless he or she chooses to waive that right!
---
Well, every new idea needs balancing, tweaking... No exceptions.
---
So maybe the range should be 15 or 20 km, the crux is displacement as a counter to scram + web doctrine.
---
In addition, displacement should not be as easy as just pushing a button. Some piloting skills need to be involved, just like mjd-ing. Timing will be imperative, for sure.
---
For example, a ghost effect needs a lot of thought. How to implement the ghost effect?
---
For example: If the pilot is able to change the speed and alignment of the Abatoc after activation of the displacement unit, the coordinates of the new position cannot be calculated until the actual displacement is happening, but then, no ghost ship... In other words, maybe one cannot allow the pilot to change the speed + alignment after activation, or maybe there should be a 5 second window between the ship disappearing and before the ship appears at the new position, giving time to create the ghost ship. But then perhaps not.
---
Many details that must sorted out. 
---
Personally I like the idea of displacement. The implementation of it is not easily done.
---
I just suggest some details to convey the idea.
---
And then we move back to tengus, and the cycle will be complete
---
In fairness I think we all had forgotten there were drone mining rigs.
---
Except thats not what they replaced. 
---
You could argue that athanors and raitarus did, but its hard to argue that fortizars and other L-class upwells aren't direct replacements for specialized (read:  upgraded) racial nullsec stations.
---
Notice me senpai
---
Haha good send him reeling! How did you know he was a spy?
---
lol yea, sure. Keep telling yourself that.
---
I guess if you consider having to avoid any capital ops due to lack of funding, and needing your allies to donate moon belts to you so you can pay your rent and SRP backlog, then The Renter Consortium is doing just great.
---
He fuckin joined discord with his mains account, with a Corp ticker and ign and everything XD
---
soooo you can't think of any, gotcha.
---
&gt;if you want to seriously live in wormholes
---
That is not true. I live in a wormhole, have one account and it is lots of fun.
---
Brazilian too btw.
---
Imperial Navy Slicer Police SKIN when?
---
I'd also accept a line of "Empresses Old Guard" SKINS that deck Imperial Navy ships out in black, white, gold, and a slew of charred marks from battles long past.
---
Certified surprise ammo deliveryman.
---
Should have named the weapon defecator or something along that.
---
Frat calls Horde, PL, NC, ~~Snuffed~~ for any important timer and then cries about Init fun fleet that shoot both sides.
---
Stop with your facts, all of nullsec is blue didn't you know?
---
haha, "micro"gang being 4 dudes shows how blobby the meta is. I would call 4 or 5 dudes small gang - but the reality is that when people say "small gang" they usually just mean a kitchen sink group of less than maybe 30 ships.
---
I don't think a second account is of critical importance until you start flying capitals... Then having the ability to light yourself an out-cyno is handy.
---
CCP has been handing out secondary training licenses like candy, so that's the price determinator for extractor isk, not PLEX.
---
But arent wormholes supposed to be 2d objects in 3d reality?
---
microgang is an archetype of role-based pvp
---
That is how I look when I'm cloaky camping wormholes.
---
Been market pvping in jita 4-4 for about 5 years now. I enjoy it
---
All blops need abit of an overhaul
---
Never sell something by just pressing sell. You always want to set a buy order. See what the lowest price is in the area for whatever the item is, then instead if selling instantly, set it to sell for a week or a month or 3 months. It takes longer to get thenisk, but you get significantly higher value. 
---
People will set up automatic buy orders for a lot lower than the value of an item so that when people like you who don't know what they're doing or are in a rush will sell it instantly for cheap and they can resell it for the real value and make a profit.
---
tackle here. 0 risk for that situation when he was alone on grid to prevent his MJD, you'll notice i pulled back to point when he was no longer alone
---
Hehe bigger one know what killboard means XDD
---
The last few years, yes.

But now it's nearly every 6 months or so. 
---
Before that is wasn't that common. When they gave free SP, mostly it was due login problems or a very long unplanned downtime. The amount of SP was also very low. Maybe 25k or even 100k, but nothing more.
---
Special events like previous week didn't exit a couple of years back. Since CCP invented injectors and extractors, the amount of special events and free sp days skyrocketted.
---
If there's anything recent politics has shown us, people will believe literally anything if you say it like a fuckwad.

What about right now though?
---
They did confirm that they like the blackout and the stats confirm that it was a good move on their part, so it's almost an announcement that they're going to keep the blackout active for a while still.

Someone previously in MCAV left and made a pseudo wingspan. It's a joke at him. Now the joke is ruined cause I had to explain it /s

After watching Quill18’s episode on the overview and realizing I’ve never configured it, what other ‘bloody obvious’ thing have I possibly missed that would make life in eve so much better ?
---
You were lying?  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78130099/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78130099/) 
---
Dude, its okey. You wanna sell something, I get it. You like the blackout I get it. Wouldnt go so far as to say you "worked" for it since it doesnt require all that much skill anymore but fine. 
---
But dont fucking blatantly lie about shit that can easily be checked.
---
Just because someone managed to fuck it up doesn't mean its not overpowered.
---
Just because someone managed to do it doesn't mean its realistically viable.
---
On the other hand, I very much do agree with some of the ideas suggested in the last paragraph, particlularly if they were to do something to cynos that are lit prior to the jammer onlining. 
---
Having had an HAW erebus 'solo yolo' onto my rorqual, tackled, jammered, but with a ten minute timer to get the response sorted while the cyno burned, &lt;- that I can confirm was OP. The rorqual I was piloting should have died, but do to the fact I had 3 braincells and was able to press the 'cynowin' button before the inhib onlined,  the only response neccessary was to make sure we had several fax ready to go, the titan properly fit, and a hammer waiting in the wings. The ten minute timer meant that we had minutes to go from "Tackled call" to "Final preflight" and still had several minutes to escalate on the original cyno.
---
I don't for sure know what the answer is, but cyno-based responses need a huge fucking nerf.
---
Are all goons in this thread forced to give up their head at the entrance? Use your brain on your own without a FC calling for it once.
---
eh, no it isn't. just a silly term that chessur liked to use a lot to be more leet.
---
role-based pvp? that's a pretty typical small gang comp, one specialized tackle and everyone else is dps, but everyone can also tackle.
---
it's nothing special, it just is what it sounds like - less people than you expect when you hear "small gang" because in the current blob meta people will call nearly anything that isn't a fleet fight a small gang.
---
Makes sense if it lasted 6 days, but doesn't only last 1 day by default and Biology increases duration by 20% per rank.  So it would last 2 days max?

I got a better idea.  Covops cynos prevent actual cynos from being lit.

Hey! Check out the in game channel “Abyssal Lurkers” and ask questions/check out the fits there. There are fits in the MOTD and any questions you have you can ask in that channel and there is usually people ready to answer and chat. :)
---
Hey new flash bud. I said “from our wormhole” on every single thing on this post just because I knew some retard would come point out that we do have a very limited number of members that do a very limited number of drops with rekking crew in derelik. We’ve been doing that for about 2 years and were never top on zkill. Infact we do it less now than ever. And still here we are atop the mountain, with much lower numbers than the blocs, and our work is as good as any when it comes to getting the content. 
---
Point being; any 116 man corp can do what we do from a nullsec static. We have no *special* advantage.
---
Lets all gang up on someone who just wants to mine or rat and then when they actually call for help lets go cry about how its ruining our play style. Pfft.
---
Ganking people who are unable or unwilling to engage in PvP at that time, as they are actually doing something productive is not a play style it is trolling/bullying behavior which is actually ruining the game for those who do not wish to play the same as you.
---
People want to know why Eve is unable to retain new customers, this is why. The ability to easily ruin someone's day and then laugh about it is a big turnoff.  If CCP implemented a PVE mode similar to GTA V where one can choose to participate in PVP or not would be better use of their time. (If in High Sec it is always on, Low sec 24hr timer to turn on/off, Null Once you enter space you do not control it auto turns off, yet those who are in their own space has a 24hr timer to turn on/off). No people can Rat and Mine in peace, and those that want to PvP can PvP.  This roaming to gank ratters is crap, especially when a fucking Frig can kill my BS because I am engaged with 15 NPC's and his 2.6% damage on the kill mail makes him think he is king of PvP.  No sir, you are a douchebag.
---
That and once you do the first set of agent missions for at the starting station, you get no further guidance on where to go or what to do, and while doing those missions you get traiing on how to properly fit a ship to continue progressing.
---
Not even close
---
Didn't it get upped to 25%?
---
Also, isk sinks are more important to eve balance than material sinks.
---
If it needs to drop loot, might I suggest it drops random mix of t1/t2 salvage mats and PI products.
---
you seem upset that nobody knows or cares who you are, did you need a quiet place?

Oh yeah im already in that, I came to reddit because no one knew the answer

This was an awesome thing, a group of Gorgon Empire worms showed up and tried to ruin the tourney and the Golem was the arena center, just melted them for picking on the newborn beans.

And I get replies every time I mention blackout being good that what you just said is the opposite lol. Thank you for posting this, keep spreading the positive effects of blackout.
---
Contrary to nullbloc belief, blackout has reduced bots drastically and has increases gang versus gang activity.

So you do have connections? And said connections has influenced your KB?

If yes, then mofo, this is what I said. Nothing more, nothing less.

Probably lots, but I'm sure you've never heard of them.

Yeah, if you don't want a second account, then don't. It'll feel like you're paying more money/isk for no reason, you'll know when you want another character.
---
On my second day I felt incredibly smug that I realised I should insure the ship the careers agent told me to crash. Many people will have done it before and it's pretty obvious, but I was happy that I remembered insure existed and then bothered to apply it.

Result: Invincible tacklers for 5 minutes.

No, you insinuated I was being misleading about our effectiveness, which i am not. If you know anything about how zkill counts points, those titan and hels that get dunked on free port supers are like, 1 point each. They have completely negligible effect on our ranking as a top zkill corp.

Huh. I didn’t think to do that. I still got a default payout (100k or so I think) but having insurance on it would have been smart. :)

Idk, maybe, I don't watch Brooklyn 99
---
If you like mining and want to move into WH space, it may be worthwhile to ninja mine gas sites. This can be done solo and is usually profitable. Make sure to mash DSCAN though.
---
Hell yeah it did but my point was that target painters+bomb+torps are an extremely deadly combination to Myrms
---
There was A LOT that was implied in that interview.  Also implied was things to shake up the bi bloc status quo.  We will probably still end up with big blocs, but anything that tries to shake them up will be interesting and might provide content.   (Note, I didn't say "will be good/bad".  I don't have faith they will do anything let alone do it well, but I believe in iterations more than stagnancy.)

We were experiencing deflation, prices on pretty much everything but PLEX was going down or atleast staying at a certain level. What we will suffer now is inflation.
---
So some of our dudes being part of Rekking Crew since before even our PL days is blatantly lying about how most of the corp's players find their content? Yeah ok.
---
In reality we scan down a hole, plop through said hole, check out the other side, try and find a fight, leave again into said hole, roll said hole, start over.
---
It's not fucking rocket science, we roam, we try to kill nullbears and see if we can bait a response.

---
I think this is a key difference. For you, in test (assuming flair accuracy in current year, I know), being evicted is essentially a theoretical exercise as long as goons arent the ones doing it.
---
For me, getting evicted is a way of life. I went to null in my first week in eve, hilariously underprepared. I was evicted or my group moved under threat of eviction 9 times in my first year. This isn't about getting hit by a bus. This is about getting behind in a class and not being able to log in for a week and half. For anyone in a small nullsec group like I used to represent, the ability to JF out of a captured station or know someone who knew someone who JFd with the evicting power was a life saver. 
---
Strange thing about it, that group no longer exists. Some of us are in PL, some in Goons, and I'm sure there's some old contacts that are in other large powers. 
---
A huge problem with eve today is there is no advantage to joining "the little guy." There's absolutely no benefit to it. My goon friends constantly point this out. Comparing actual benefits, aside from having to live with the ticker, there is absolutely no reason to not join goons. Asset safety at least reduces the penalty for not being in goons. That alone is a good reason to leave it in. 
---
Keeping in mind where serentity ended, I think its mindful to keep in mind 2nd order effects of changes suggested in the name of a "pure" eve.
---
Oh?! This is news to me. How does one get one?  
---
Will have to look at modelling that in the spreadsheet, thanks!
---
Best post on last year circlejerk was when they said they won Ualx outnumbered ( they actually had more supers) and farmed us, it was a pretty amusing post.
---
Maybe one of these:
---
- hitting tab in a price input box will format it with periods and comma's, while hover will tell you an approximate mil/bill.  
---
- having a set course will autoselect the next gate/station after jumping in system. No need to select it from the overview, just press [Jump/Dock]  
---
- no need to wait a full mining cycle when theres 50 units left in an asteroid. Turn off your laser to have it pop early.  
---
- learn how dscan works before you leave hisec.  
---
- highlight everyone in local chat. Any players jumping into system later will stand out as unselected.
---
Look up rattlesnake fits, you can find some for about 700 which should do pretty well, ours do anyway.
---
back when the abyss first came out i did a lot of experimenting while it was still possible on sisi. it might still be possible again, idk havent played in a while. I came to the conclusion after going thru 100s of fits and dozens of cruisers that there was just 1 ship meant for doing solo abyss sites, on the highest level.  I still have the fit loaded in my pyfa, it's a monster fit and yes you need metaplasmid mods to pull it off. ive often debated releasing this information... but what would I get out of it?
---
So you have to get about 600M a day to keep it up and 1.5 hours of Rorqual Minging so how ever much m3 of ore that is to keep both up.
---
Thanks for reply omg by the way this is really helpful
---
Edit: I did the math a rorq can pull about 118m3/s
---
So you need about 650km3 of or to keep the dam up

Would love input as well because I was confused. They recently wardecced us as well. (UNI)

Auto-targetting missiles are pretty fun to run alongside salvage drones and a few salvager modules. Not as efficient maybe, but it makes for a great change of pace if you're burning out on missions.
---
So... Just to add my 2 cents... No, no, hell no
---
Don't worry about alts, until you find you have a reason to use one.
---
I started my second account, my shadow (goes wherever I do) about a month after starting my first account.  It's purpose is to make my life easier.  He started-off hauling while I mined, and salvaging missions.  Has grown into being a hauling, drone / fighter / bomber boat pilot, capital alt, and fleet booster.  He has no missile nor turret skills, but complete mastery (all 5's) of everything under drones, and the related ships.  Including Black Ops 5 (and all races carriers/FAX and Rorqual to 5 because also jump drives).
---
I currently have 4 annually-subscribed accounts.
---
1.  Me, industry alt, cyno alt.    
---
2.  My shadow, cyno alt, structure holding corp director.    
---
3.  Primary industry alt &amp; CEO, industry alt, SP extraction char (xferred when friend quit).    
---
4.  Explorer alt, cyno alt, &lt;empty&gt;    
---
5.  Alpha alt different structure holding corp director.     
---
Calling an alt a cyno alt is a bit misleading, as pretty much every char can pilot Covert Ops and use a covert cyno.  Once upon a time, cyno alts were only 900,000 SP limited because of free medical clones, but no longer.  I spent over 2m free SP (thanks CCP) on one of them recently.

Why does trig need to be special too? They already have their niche. Use what's available already from other factions.

If you have connections and said connections influence your KB then ye its misleading. But honestly, I dont care. Like I said before.

Saying you dont have connections when its fking obvious you do is a blatant lie. " dude wtf are you talking about? We don't have "connections". "

You've backed yourself in a corner and can't get out. Hell, you even cared enough to go look at our killboard just to prove a point, which you failed to make.
---
The type of content you are looking for still exists. There are groups that won't escalate (either because they can't, or because it is their play style). But Eve has always had forced escalations.

Go find the OP's group and brawl with them. You know they won't escalate.

There was a promotion a bit back where you got 3 months MCT for like $1 if you bought 3 months of subs. It's not possible to quantify how many people got those but plenty did and they are depressing the cost of extractors.

---
&gt;  It’s simply too easy for groups to evac assets, as we saw in the Glassing of Tribute. An entire coalition was able to pick up everything and move it to entirely new region without serious incident. 
---
IMO I think this is kinda missing the point that even a large coalition felt it had no choice but to get all of its shit out in the first place because it had exactly zero chance of a favourable outcome. 
---
If a tornado is about to hit your house, you grab your cat, your phone and your box of valuables and either hide or run in order to survive. You don't stand outside blowing puffs of air at the oncoming storm. You GTFO what you can and let your insurance take care of the rest. 
---
&gt; There is likely a good middle ground between the wormhole style loot pinata and the current asset safety system. I hope we find it. 
---
I was going to say a dedicated safety hanger that had limited m3 but was protected from dropping, and had a short delay on moving things in / out of it. Then I realised that people would just use countless alt accounts. 
---
Edit: I did once propose increasing the % of asset safety and then paying out 50% of the outgoings to whoeever captured a large (250k-ish) "asset safety computer" that was ejected from a destroyed structure, and could never be destroyed in space (i.e. it would always drop regardless of how many times the freighter it was in got popped).
---
&gt; The September Summit is approaching, and it is the optimal time to hear what players want so the CSM can prepare for the meetings.
---
Cynos. Cynos and Cynos. If Cynos are not fixed to offer more counter-play (spool up, dynamic range etc) then the elephant that just hot-dropped into the room is going to continue to crush everything that walks in.
---
You might also want to throw your weight behind better nullsec logistics for small groups (black ops jump freighters) and rebalancing skill injectors to have penalties based on the skill being trained, rather than the total number of skill points the character has (https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cij1a3/injector_balance/ev66ft2/).
---
Do you live under a rock? or are you just Member No. 1209371230123 of (insert big blue blob here)?!
---
You play EVE long enough you get connections. For example with Rekking Crew.
---
Your implication however, that we use or need these connections to facilitate our day to day content for the vast majority of our members is simply false. If you would direct your attention to the linked killmail, you'd see that there is ONE (in digits 1) player of our corp on that killmail.
---
It's not like we're dunking heavy duty assets with shifty politcal maneuvres every other day. We shit on nerds, that are unable to D-Scan properly or their friends trying to bail their mouthbreathing asses out.

Is there anything useful you can do with the ship maintenance hangar on a nestor?

Don't buy more than you need, might find yourself stuck with assets/resources that have very little real world value. Hilmar said a lot of changes and chaos are coming. The eve of the future might not be what you're expecting as it costs less and less to run the game, less and less employees year over year.
---
the question was more for him to know, im fully aware lol
---
You realise people have been running t5 reliably in gilas &amp; sacrileges since they came out right? What could you have possibly pyfa'd up that you believe noone has tried before or is already using?
---
A Try hard post!
---
Somewhere along those lines ye. The rorqual is 1,5 Rorqs\*2 hours so roughly 3 hours worth of Rorq mining. Sorry if I explained it poorly.
---
Numbers arent exact but in my experience they are somewhere along those lines. One could also count it in anoms, each haven/sanctum is about 1% so about 5-6 minutes worth of superratting. For rorqs I think its about 8-9 minutes of mining. And every day you lose 24%.

Hope it helps you.

---
Right, because the offensive capability of a Monitor is totally equal to a Thanatos. N+1 is real, but obviously is meant to apply to similar ship types.
---
Honestly I like the idea of giving black ops an expanded and more interesting on-grid role. Letting some Helios block out Titans seems kinda lame
---
Wtf they had more numbers how did they not win...
---
&gt; I think this is a key difference. For you, in test (assuming flair accuracy in current year, I know), being evicted is essentially a theoretical exercise as long as goons arent the ones doing it.
---
Not really. I was in Providence when CVA was evicted by -A-, I have been evicted from a wormhole, and I was a member of Morsus Mihi and my evac freighter was lost with all hands (and most of my stuff). I've lost the better part of my wealth (not that I've ever been rich in eve terms). I am in Test today but I'm a rather recent acquisition.
---
When I bring up this issue, I make a suggestion to change the current recovery fee to an equal RNG mechanic that can cause loot to drop when your station is destroyed. I've stated 15 or 20% but not any higher numbers. and I suggested the fee be removed in compensation. The people who lose stuff will still only lose roughly what they lost before but this time, it'll be assets that can be picked up by the victor.
---
You know who hates on me the most for this idea? Usually the guys in the biggest blocs. Goons who comment (and one guy from Test) tend to go way overboard with hyperbolic hand-wringing and angry insults.
---
Small nullseccers have complained as well but it really seems to threaten the biggest guys the most. Certainly they seem to get the most angry, which is funny since I know this idea would never happen.
---
Eve felt more dangerous when I started. I miss that feeling and I have loved the blackout. Spending five minutes trying to figure out if that Loki on scan is blue or not brings back those feelings of danger.
---
I don't know that your feeling that asset loss would hit the smaller guys more than the bigger. The biggest alliances have stockpiles at risk that would probably dwarf their liquid assets. I'm not privy to this obviously but that's my impression.
---
&gt;This is about getting behind in a class and not being able to log in for a week and half.
---
I do get this. I know it sucks. But that suck is one reason I liked this game so much. When I lost my wormhole during a family emergency, I lost pretty much 75% of my assets (the important ones at least). I'm proposing a 15-20% chance of losing individual assets which isn't much different than requiring the payment from liquid funds. My preference would be complete removal (because I'm a masochist or something) but I've proposed nothing more than a change in the method of accounting we currently use while offering some loot to the victors.
---
It's interesting who screams most vocally about these proposals that will never come to pass. It ain't the little guys.
---
A cyno inhibitor is like 30mill and blocks out Titans. But I want to see blops used for more than bomber bridging.
---
Interesting, do you have a garmur fit for that?

Tell me why these people flying to icland, and having no say in the next chaos year of development is better than having even one of the dudes who had to be cut to make the budget right
---
You want titans dropped on you? This is how you get titans dropped on you.
---
Next time just defang the carriers, ez.
---
Just imagine when the entirety of EVE blobs you with capitals. Like wouldn't that be unfair?
---
More like, it takes 15sec to charge up the cyno, and it takes another 15sec for a capital to lock onto the cyno with its jump drives and complete the jump-in... You then have 30 seconds (best case) to kill the cynoship before help arrives...
---
Balanced? I don't know...

I wonder how nullsec peoples hates free market, is it because of spodbrains?
---
It's not for no good reason. A core part of eve gameplay is risk management. Don't fly what you can't afford to lose is the games cardinal rule and one of the first bits of advice that is universally given to new players. 
---
Why does it make sense that you should have to consider the risk/reward of how much you spend on your ship and where you fly it, but not where you store it?
---
Also, so long as NPC stations exist you don't NEED to do those logistics, just if you want to live in the highest risk and highest reward area of space

you cant really use pyfa to get the actual fit, just the base fit that needs to be upgraded with metaplasmid mods.  no one in their right mind would have fielded this ship that i built, unless it was on sisi. because it is several billion isk worth of rare mods, and you will die if you dont know all the kinks.  but that being said, it absolutely demolishes the sites with plenty of time to spare.  been out of the game for quite a while now, but i would assume the fits for sacs and gilas are the same they used to be, and unless things have drastically changed in t5s, many who pilot those ship operate on expected losses when they hit the perfect storm.  there is no perfect storm to stop my build, only you screwing up... which is possible, not gna lie.. but u wont get screwed over by a triple spawn of the sniper BS for example, it'll be for a reason you could have avoided if you had realized it
---
Faction large shield extenders are good stuff
---
I would suggest you set up an alpha account and begin training skills just in case, it doesn't cost you anything and by the time that you figure that you need a second account you can have a 5.5 million SP alt ready that would otherwise take you 2+ months to train up from scratch.

Nah :P, it that was the case I'd be on the other side of the hole.
---
I scammed a guy pretty thoroughly one time on r/eve, he was either a newbie who got scammed, or bait (obv). 
---
But he had posted about a scam he had fallen for and I hit him in the comments with a sales pitch for like Chabo's Guide to Avoiding New Player Scams, came up with this whole shtick of like Corp-level Licenses to the pdf, since he was in [whatever corp/alliance idr] they could pay x mil. per member for a total of whatever isk, and I'd release the pdf. Something like that.
---
I almost, *almost* went ahead and made a character to execute on the scam, cause he seemed totally on the hook. Figured well I'll just hang out and scam for the 30-60min. of Vidya Time I get per day. But, my laziness and reluctance to open my addictive brain up to the .exe took over.
---
I was gonna say "so I just linked him the urgaypwned pastebin instead" but I *just* remembered in the re-telling: I totally fucking did that from the get-go and referenced it as the "free sample text" and he just kept biting lol. So either totally oblivious, or he didnt open the link, or it was just really weird newbie-donation-bait all along. 
---
Anyway, theres plenty of PVP and fun roaming to be had on r/eve so I'll just stick to post-sec probably :p thanks for  listening to my TED Talk.
---
Link Garmur fit and boosters?

Thanks

hawks are always darks. It is not my fit to just spread on the interwebs but just take a hawk and bling the living fuck out of it and your pod. It is something like a 1bill pod and some times you will die, like once every 5 or 6 hours, due to the RNG of some of the rooms. Though you will earn 500-600 mill an hour so it easily makes up for it. It is not for the fait hearted.

If you intend to fly caps you will need 2 omega accounts. So you can cyno without relying on others.

If you intend to be a large scale industrialist you will need a ton of accounts so you can have enough manufacturing slots.

For most other play styles, 1 account is enough.

If you intend to pvp in lowsec, I very strongly recommend training and hauling alt to fly a deep space transport. But that can be another char slot on your account and not multiboxed. It’s just to ease logistics by having a completely neutral hauler.

In other news carries have more then one set of fighters, we stop for moment and they alpha our high value targets. If you try and defang we lose logi and links they reload more fighters. Low sec means no bombs or smart bombs. We can escalate but so can snuffed out, that would be playing to there strengths.

Maybe we make it bigger op tweak the doctrine a bit and let n+1 do its thing. Or we change doctrines all together and throw them a curve ball.

One account is just fine, specially as a new player with limited time. After a few months in the game , it's up to you to decide if you need a second one or not. Personally I've been playing for years, and I only got my second account when I wanted a capital ship (I did not enjoyed capitals that much and currently I have it unsubscribed).
---
It's not the number of accounts that's important , first priority is to make friends in the game that are good company for you.

Honestly the citadel spam, i get why its a hard thing to balence but i may have a shitty solution.
---
Deployable structure called "shield suppression device or something similar and it takes x hours to anchor, its vulnerable whilst deployed and setting up and once setup next to a lowpower citadel, it removes the damage cap and also the reinforcement cycle or the structure, allowing you to clear them out wothout waiting ages, possibly make them in 3 sizes, small for astra, athanor and raits being 1 hour anchor time, mediums for fortis, azbels and tataras being 4 and large being 12 hours, this also allows sufficient time to counter them with varying levels of favour to the defender
---
Keepstar should never be lowpower but you got 12 hours to pop this Shield suppression device or they can blap your keepstar, fortis take less time but are less of an investment and then astras and raits can be killed quickly if not defended
---
Also gives more of an incentive for fights as a big gang coming tgrough can now start destroying low power stations if not fought away, leading people away from the dock up mentality
---
the rats are 'asfar as i can tell' - locked into attacking the same target.. if you enter first - they are verry likely to agress the same person if you are in their agro range when they re-spawn.
---
in short- if you log in after DT, put your ships into place, you are ready for the next 23hrs &gt; the only way you will "lose" payouts is if someone actualy tries to kill the rats // for 10-15mil/hr   and competes with you for the next 23hrs

I would contend that null-logistics is easy enough.
---
We are no longer escorting freighters, the jump-freighter has already made logistics easy enough to support thousands of players in alliances with little difficulty.
---
(and yes, I assisted in null logistics)
---
Yeah, I can only imagine how much difficulty getting all the little fiddly details right will be.
---
Noice!
---
also people calling you gay in local, yes
---
The ring itself is a uniquely identifying feature, and can be seen from several regions away! Additionally, I always thought it was cool that the region named Cloud Ring actually has a cloud ring
---
to be fair, this is an actual war they're fighting so they'll use everything they can and I don't fault them
---
&gt; many who pilot those ship operate on expected losses when they hit the perfect storm
---
haha no. Well i guess the internet connection shitting itself or the power going out would result in a ship loss :p
---
N+1 is good for pretty much all pve activities too, anything that requires little interaction
---
The standup munition stood up too fast and now it's dizzy n' shit
---
Fair
---
Skill-based intelligence tools would be awesome. Ever since I started playing I was annoyed by how there was so much functionality offered by fan-made tools but wasn't available in the game itself. This would be one step in the right direction, IMHO.
---
You really don't want to use a BR nor DST for hauling any significant distance, nor crossing sov &amp; sec boundaries.  They are not great at evading in-gate bubbles nor camps (or a fleet that just happens to be on the in-gate), so you really want to use a scouting alt(s).
---
Aside from what others have posted, you could also join just about any nulsec corp, and offer your hauling services to the members.
---
I used to do jump freighter runs to &amp; from Jita for corp members.  I hauled free-of-charge, but members would tip or give a courier contract reward.
---
I used a DST to do in-region hauling from home-base to market hubs, as well as to haul PI (I helped run a corporate PI buy-back program).  I use a BR as a shuttle with a cargohold (was less jump fatigue on bridges), especially when I went shopping at said markets, or to setup cyno alts with ships / cynos / ozone.
---
So I mostly see people flying Hounds. Is there a particular reason to fly a hound over other bombers?
---
well i knew that once the new damage multiplier drugs came out, t5s would become a lot less risk adverse for your average ship... CCP did a good job in the beginning of making things very tight and centered around a dps race. it couldnt last though. but that also just means that my build will be just that much more effective, because it was purely a dps and avoidance build.  i digress though. i could sit here all day trying to convince you of what i know to be true, because i put in the hours and did the work... and i wouldnt get anything for it but more downvotes from people who havent done the work and remain unconvinced
---
Were you guys on coms too? You almost got a nyx because he refused to dock up after us telling him to.
---
wtf y not?
---
If you think risk/reward is why people are playing, you're the dumb one.
---
That...actually makes a ton of sense from both a gameplay and a lore perspective. It would make using a cyno beacon a strategic decision, one where you weighed the benefits of jumping in your own fleet against the possibility your opponents might have a fleet of their own in reserve, waiting for you to do just that.
---
It is neither Nullsec nor the alliances who "hate" free market, it is some of their leaders using their minions to make themselves even richer.

---
Then Snuff reset their standings.
---
I ran frequent nullsec logistics for a small alliance for quite a while when I was in there. We were deep into nullsec, and let me tell you you, if we had black ops jump freighters, I might still very well be there.
---
Current JFs rely on a chain of either friendly citadels or NPC space between home and highsec. This means conducting logistics almost anywhere in deep nullsec effectively forces you to be part of a large blue coalition as without that chain you cannot keep ample supply lines open to even meet your day-to-day needs, let alone properly equip yourself for defence.
---
You lose your standings with the coalition, and you're fucked. Not because you're going to immediately get invaded, but because you're going to be starved out because your logistics routes are now hostile.
---
TIL Guard left CCP because of budget cuts.
---
Not enough reeeeeeee
---
I don't do multiple accounts due to time (and money).  Works fine for me
---
&gt;Tell me why these people flying to icland, and having no say in the next chaos year of development is better than having even one of the dudes who had to be cut to make the budget right
---
Because CSM protects CCP in that CCP can pretend to communicate with the community without actually doing so. Most of the time they dont fix anything, so they dont want to discuss anything in public.
---
Going to pop in here to clarify one major point:
---
The standard recommendation is not "join a newbie-oriented null sec group" it's "join a corporation". If you're running missions and grinding standings, join a corporation that's doing that. It'll be a much better experience. You can always join that nullsec corporation later. In Eve, the people are the good gameplay. The game itself isn't.
---
so here's what you do. you're not going to be able to fly that for actual market logistics, but you can work with covert/blackops fleets as a mobile fuel and bomb truck. Look into hanging out with groups like bombers bar, they actually will pay you to do this job with the loot that they get from kills.
---
Great effort!
---
Nah I just want to farm and Netflix and chill
---
Very old returning player from 2006; I've just started getting into dealing with higher value cargoes... 1-2 billion isk range +.
---
How do I haul 1-2+ billion isk cargoes in relative safety in high sec? I know nothing is ever 100% safe, I just want to make it as least worth it to my attacker as possible. 
---
My issue is the question of what is the safest way to transport cargoes with value like that? My isk making method includes hauling to and from Jita - which can be a dangerous proposition due to suicide gankers. Contracts are not the way to go for me as I'll often need cargo transported on very short notice and at times my profit margins are thin enough to likely not cover the transportation fee. 
---
I don't need more than 50,000 m3 of space at most. I can tolerate 9,000 m3 but can't really go much below that.
---
I've been drowning myself in information trying to figure out what is a relatively "safe" hauler for 1-2 billion + isk cargoes, and all I've accomplished is emerging thoroughly confused. 
---
I've heard some people say "carry everything in a cloaky 100k hp transport", then others say "omg no never carry more than 100m isk of cargo in those". I've also heard you can carry 500 million isk of cargo in a freighter, but then I've also heard freighters are often suicide ganked just for fun, let alone if they actually have cargo...
---
So yeah, TLDR is I'm thoroughly confused and just want to know the best way to haul 1-2+ billion isk of goods in high sec near Jita. 
---
What ship should I use to haul 1-2+ billion isk of goods near Jita?
---
On a fun side note, I yolo'd 500 million isk of cargo in an untanked Iteron V to Jita for the fun and adrenaline, my heart was pumping the whole time. Not doing that again XD 
---
As this ship will be supporting my primary method of generating 600 million isk/hour per active hour played, I need reliability and safety. The ship in question will be used daily so I want whatever's as safe as possible.
---
Thanks for taking the time and effort to answer this!
---
The middle ground on asset safety is to raise its costs and leave it in.

---
I've checked and they started 101 wars yesterday. Idk, all major players and some randos (including us) are in.
---
Blue bomb op
---
That would be no good reason.  The reason simply being that only NPC stations can keep things safe when you arent on the game.  That just sucks for trying to live someplace in null and have a life outside the game.  It makes sense with regards to risk vs. reward because storage is typically supposed to be safe in general, especially when you are offline.  So long as NPC stations exist you absolutely need to do those logistics because you cant store something someplace when you go offline and have it be there when you get back if asset safety is gone.
---
&gt;Cynos. Cynos and Cynos. If Cynos are not fixed to offer more counter-play (spool up, dynamic range etc) then the elephant that just hot-dropped into the room is going to continue to crush everything that walks in.

This is the #1 issue in the game right now. If this isnt fixed (and the fix is obvious, its just a matter of how much), we can just stay docked.

BREAKING NEWS!!! To encourage friction between player alliances, CCP will lower corp members cap drastically by eliminating Corp Management skill category and setting it to 100 players per corp. Alliances will be a maximum of 5 corps. It is to prevent massive alliances with more than half the player base and creating carebears where it should have none.   
---
Also, they recognized that if bumping can break a warp out, it should also break structure somehow: Collision damage is coming next update!
---
You say that but it's coming off as hyper projection bud when you furiously slam your keyboard calling everyone who has a slight disagreement with you an idiot or snowflake.
---
Please continue proving my point though.
---
always :(
---
The problem there is that the earth side was suffering greatly from infighting and lack of resources - EVE was a miraculous second genesis, and it’s unclear how well the people on the earth side would have been doing after the loss of the WH
---
I wasn't on comms because. But the fleet chat was pretty damn funny.
---
I love that you included Bartle's types. While you're about it, though, it's worth noting that EVE hunters include pilots from all four types. Probably fewer Socialites, but I think my corp (to use one example) is more Explorers and Achievers than Killers, and we do quite a bit of hunting.
---
On a wormholes-related note, you seem to be harboring some misconceptions about what logistics without asset safety is like. Long before the glassing of Tribute, wormholers have proven that vaguely prepared, vaguely active players can protect their assets from theft-by-eviction. And yet there are many wormhole corps that run evictions for profit.
---
But this is the key: Vaguely prepared, vaguely active.
---
You see a veteran, organized coalition extracting their major coalition assets without incident. This is the easy part. For every 10 residents of Tribute, I guarantee there is at least 1 who was active long enough to build up personal assets, but couldn't be arsed to move some (or all!) of those personal assets. In wormhole space, this is where the profit of evictions comes from, and it will be the same for nullsec. Yes, evac'ing assets is easy. People *still* won't do it.
---
People taking breaks from the game are definitely worth thinking about, but people take breaks in wormholes too. If it's a planned break, asset safety is wildly unnecessary. I recently took a break where I was going to be without internet for a while. I stuffed my valuable assets into a freighter, and my ships into a shared hangar where some trusted corp-mates could evac them (or use them) if needed. This took me less than an hour.
---
Unplanned breaks are also worth considering, but I would ask how much of what draws us to EVE is the *stuff* and how much is the *people*? If my corp were evicted and a corp-mate who had been out unexpectedly returned afterward, you best believe I would be chipping in to help them get back on their feet. I think most of us feel the same.
---
All that said, I agree with you that a middle ground is what we should be looking for.
---
I have ideas about what that middle ground should be, but I think you've heard them from me before. :-)

I played for about 3 years before I started my first multibox-account. Plenty of people have played without any alt-accounts.
---
Eve is a sandbox which means you do you.
---
That sounds like a good idea, but I think gate-camping ought to be an exception to this delay unless it was the result of a war between alliances/corps. I haven't participated in any wars yet (that'll probably change soon), but I've gotten blown up and podded several times by gate-campers just because they could. The only time I was carrying anything valuable was a few days ago, and that was a single module I had fitted to my Rupture.
---
It may be fun for the gate-campers, but being on the receiving end isn't fun at all, and it's probably one of the main things that drive people away from the game. Jumping into a group of ships that you can't possibly fight, who proceed to blow up your ship and obliterate your pod *just because they can* is *annoying* at best.
---
Before anyone goes into some spiel accusing me of being a whiny carebear who doesn't belong in EVE, I'd like to point out that I followed this game in the media for nearly a decade before I started playing; I *knew* what I was getting into and fully accept that - with the exception of an NPC station dock - nowhere in New Eden is truly safe, some regions are just safer than others. I also know that it's possible to avoid a gate-camp by just docking up at a station and waiting them out, but keep in mind that that's encouraging people to not play the game.

I'd like to have it where someone who enjoys playing solo or doesn't have reliable access to scouts could still thrive in the game, even when they enter low and nullsec. Of course, I'm also sure that there are over a dozen ways any solution I propose could be exploited in ways I haven't thought of through the use of alternate characters, so I'm honestly wondering if I should even bother trying. This post is probably going to get downvoted to hell anyway.
---
[tilts head]
---
Huh, it kinda does!
---
Whats that
---
Instant teleportation is a nightmare to balance in every multiplayer game where it exists.
---
There have been lots of suggestions in here from making cynos spool up, limiting mass per cyno, disabling supers/titans from jumping through lowsec, making all cynos public, giving black ops inherent cyno inhibition abilities, decreasing the predictability of cyno exit range, etc. At least a few ideas are worth toying with.
---
Yeah, now we have a hard on to kill you (in game) sooo bad right now.
---
That’s what it looks like on my computer as I run the game in potato mode.

Noob question: how does one hunting sub-capital ship go up against an entire fleet and not get obliterated in less than a minute?

Good point on them!
---
Are you the same guy that posted that cringe iki video
---
I only have two accounts subbed, one I regularly log into, yet spread across 4 accounts total I have 6 characters in TEST. doesn't mean I have 6 logged in, in fleet, all in a combat ship... yet people continue to throw raw numbers around crying "but tapi has half a million characters reeee"
---
I can feel my iq dropping already, and I haven't even seen it yet

After resolving a strikedown due to music copyright, here's a fight we had back in May against Siberian squads. Huge amount of fun on a gate grid split over a few hundred km. Featuring some awesome booshes, and an accidentactical bait with our Bhaalgorn!

i like this subreddit because everyone is very abrasive and talks shit on each other, its very unlike most other subreddits. which is truer to life in my experience. dont get me wrong, the same wave of overly polite kiss ass pandering for upvotes still exists here, just to a lesser degree than most of reddit
---
Anyone that good at pvp and has decent knowledge in game mechanics think you’re a fucking idiot. You’re that dumb ass in the video saying “17K”. Been several years and here you are. With players like you, i see why Shadoo and majority of the other great vets stop playing.

Lmao you're elite

I honestly think that it's a shame how they're getting rid of all the old POS assets. I think it would be nice they were reused in a DIY Starbase mechanic where players could link up several modules to create their own station, with the possible inclusion of various racial hub stations ([Amarr](https://www.eveonlineships.com/eve-ship-database.php?es=Amarr+Station+Hub&amp;ids=1926), [Caldari](https://www.eveonlineships.com/eve-ship-database.php?es=Caldari+Station+Hub&amp;ids=3871), [Gallente](https://www.eveonlineships.com/eve-ship-database.php?es=Gallente+Station+Hub+&amp;ids=57), [Minmatar](https://www.eveonlineships.com/eve-ship-database.php?es=Minmatar+Hub&amp;ids=2496)) for use by corporations instead of individuals.

Ah yes ignorance is bliss , strategy in which sov to hold and which to take and fight over is crucial to the growth and to the destructions of the enemy and ones own alliance.
---
It’s pvp on a different scale but I understand your mind doesn’t comprehend these things .....

it’s ok.

  And recently, thanks to blackout, finally being able to hunt and kill krab ships solo
---
&gt;blops can drop without being super umbrellad to all hell
---
I don't understand why you need to worry about supers in a blops fleet. You can get in,  wreck the target,  leave and safe up before most reactions can even occur.
---
Solo blops sure, perhaps.
---
What a time to in Snuffed.. when everyone just runs away.
---
You will want to kill yourself using blasters for missions

Is Dreddit a pure pvp corp?
---
As others have suggested, please look into the /evejobs subreddit. 
---
Small gang ustz groups I would recommend are Unspoken Alliance EU/Early US (I may be biased), or Rote Kapelle (late ustz/autz), both are small sov alliances in null.
---
There are a lot of fun WH groups, with varying requirements. Just look at all the recruiting posts and talk to at least 3 groups and see what interests you the most. 
---
PM me for some honest opinions if you’d like :-)
---
I would say we’re “rounded”.  From a mentor perspective, we advise everyone be self sustaining through whatever means they find enjoyable. All corp fleets are pvp though.
---
THERE IS NO FUCKING GRAPHITE.
---
man i just got my stuff out of asset safety it already cost so much and then I had to get it out of lowsec and I almost lost the majority of it when I did and some of it is still stuck in those back water lowsec system that is podium. not every can fly a jump freighter
---
With the new activity from the Drifters, maybe CCP will introduce a change to the sovereignty system as *they* start using their own (superior) version of entosis links on structures in nullsec, causing Upwell and the empires to freak out and do everything they can to make their structures immune to entosis hacking. That this makes them completely useless in sov warfare is "obviously" just a happy coincidence! :D
---
I mean, really! Just look at the item description (emphasis mine):
---
"Disclaimer: The Carthum Conglomerate, as well as its registered subsidiaries and partners, accepts absolutely no legal or ethical liability for any unforeseen consequences of ***connecting untested Drifter-derived technology directly to the user's mind***."
---
Does that sound like it *wouldn't* have unfortunate consequences somewhere down the line?
---
1. What is a goon titan? I’m not too familiar with Eve history but was that some historical PvP full scale war?
---
2. You what?
---
3. Any good stories? What do you fly in?! Also wtf is a krab....
---
Im late ustz so i will add Rote to the list.  Thanks!
---
i've seen this before .. i think its a bug in the target becoming temporarily unavailable as a target (ie, initiating warp but then canceling it maybe?).  Normally they just keep flying off but under this certain condition it's still trying to hit the target that it can't anymore. :)
---
I don't really begrudge a line member for not being ultra elite PvP (hell, I'm not even elite despite what mom tells me). I'd expect more out of the FCing though I mean come on.
---
Yeah, if you wanna invest in a ship for L4, rattlesnake is the way to go
---
&gt;been having this same issue for 2 days now.  thought it would fix it self . can't post on eve forums or anything even on phone not conected to wifi .   really looks like eve stuff is fubard atm.
---
Well, that *is* how it got the name, so why would you think otherwise? ;)
---
TBH I only have 2 paid accounts (5 characters total) and I feel like I have multiple personally disorder sometimes.  It is fun to role play the second character.  Just keep in mind a second account can simply be a utility character, little more than an extension of your main character.  A cyno alt is the perfect example of this.  As you learn more about Eve you will understand this.  It's one of the many wonderful ways Eve O is different from other games but don't worry you will have a lot of fun with one account.
---

Heyo

[Discord](https://discord.rote.works/) if you wanna chat further.
---
I did the large newbie corp dance with horde, what makes Dreddit different? (not being an ass, looking for a real answer)
---
Thanks! I have been debating provi space (where I flew back in 2008-09) or applying to dreddit since I like the reddit community. I would say I am not a pvper at first but if provoked I will fight back.
---
Any big wins over the 5 years?
---
I'm very sure that a line member who clicks buttons when told to, and flies the ships he's told to, understands the grand scheme of things in eve. If you're not one of these great fcs you're talking about believe me when I tell you, you don't understand anything about pvp
---
Yikes, good he deserved to be shamed then
---
They said a Revenant, so I'm guessing it's a turd.
---
Where do you get stuck most in PvP? I saw the eve weekly help guide for this sub and it looks like they have a lot of PvP info there!
---
"Strong independant alliance"
---
Awesome, now train cyno 5 and a whole new world will open up for you
---
Yep, they have them essentially on rotation.
---
Double damage Navi domi is better for L4’s
---
Gardes and blasters.  Best against serpentis and Kim/therm baddies.  Funny I just made a reply about this recently. not for the cheap or low skilled, but its fun a few times a year. 
---

I will ping after i get home from work.  (Workin real hard right now lol)
---
Not at all.. I'm actually very calm.  Clearly youre not and that's what's funny because you're trying to turn it around which is amusing in itself.  I've not disagreed with anyone just not listening to your boring shit.  You can post derogatory messages and expect no comeback. Simple
---
Sure! My time with dreddit so far has been good (I came in with prior experience) - there’s definitely an element of what you put in is what you get out.
---
While we do have some things that are newbro centered, the corp also has some pretty advanced groups (caps, blops, bombers, you get the idea. ) we dont force anything on our members, and ultimately pretty chill.
---
Feel free to join our Discord (iirc there will be one on the recruiting site) and hang out and chat in the public channels. Ultimately I’d want you to find a corp you feel comfortable in. If that’s with us, awesome! If not, that’s cool too. Eve is meant to be played in community. :)
---
Weeb
---
Make a wadded-up Origominix.
---
Maybe a papercraft modell
---
You were right, your dreadbombs make whole alliances disband.
---
Delve is blood raider space so the rats do EM thermal damage and will have little to no explosive resist
---
To be fair not all people in eve are good gameplay either, there's some turbo garbage corps out there.
---
At least be a little selective in who you join
---
Welcome back! Yeah, if you’re more industry focused there’s quite a bit of market pvp as well. Feel free to check us out more!
---
Oh shit we back on the block fam!
---
In general for PvE you want long range platforms rather than short range because the rats want to orbit you outside of blaster distance so you'll spend your whole time chasing them down (there are exceptions to this in some nullsec sites). This basically rules out everything except a Kronos from using blasters because it has the range bonuses to still hit 1k dps out to about 50km.
---
e: Also /r/fittings for stuff like this
---
Yes I did that as an alpha made 60-80 million isk a day, lost some ventures but they are cheap.
---
Lol amazing that people still participate in these no skill smooth brain blob slug fests.
---
Except reducing the number of slots or making more default service require a slot mean people need more structure total to handle all their current service set so they will setup more leading to more bitching because there would be even more to shoot.
---
It's actually been some one the most fun i've had in a while. Really enjoyable group of guys.
---
Username checks out
---
It's not really necessary unless you choose to skill into capitals (when having a cyno alt is so useful it's almost mandatory).
---
Although having trade alts and out of corp hauling alts is definitely useful. But you don't need to multibox those, you can switch to them when you need them.
---
If you really have to use hybrids for lvl 4's use rails.
---
Fuck. I could have finally lost my basi and made 600m isk(thanks double srp). Damn work.
---
Take a good fit.
---
Replace all the modules with compact meta.
---
Downgrade drones to navy faction.
---
Load navy faction missiles.
---
If it still doesn't fit train the fitting skills. +1%, +3% PC/CPU implants are also pretty cheap if it almost fits.  
---
Faction modules can be good too if you want to spend some money (some of them are cheap too).
---
Lol Boat crying on reddit? WHO KNEW!?!?!
---
Damn. Nowhere near this dust up and we still get dragged. EvE is ruff stuff.
---
What are you even talking about? Have you ever lived in a WH? it's literally rolling the NS static and Dscan... HAHAHA This guys so lost he thinks were rage rolling into systems to kill people we have eyes on? 
---
Waffles has been in the WH for over a month DUDE hahaha the tears.
---
And that is supposedly good enough for t3?
---
Are you dumb?
---
Cable you're doing gods work o7
---
how can we shoot blues if we reset ppl 4head
---
your garbage casual playstyle made more people quit than it kept in the game. you still are and always will be cancer. stick to marketing meaningless shit irl.
---
And other people could sit here informing you that you are no special snowflake with the only fit that works.But what would we get out of it?  t5 has been reliably farmed with no losses and even some sub 2 bill fits including implants. Your fit isn't special and you don't need billions and billions of fits and special mods to run t5 abyss. Shit. Kiting Cerberus platforms can do it reliably. Google for like 5 minutes.
---
Depending on your skills probably yeah. I haven't ran them in a while so they may have changed.
---
When in doubt you can try it on SISI (if filaments are still seeded there. Or if you can get some from a buddy).
---
Yeah they'd be tempting too, but it kind of depends if you want cores over everything, or more per-core performance. Since I typically run 10-16 and up to 20 clients, I really just wanted tons of cores personally.
---
They also slashed the last gen threadripper prices pretty heavily.
---
Lots to be honest. Too many people think that market PvP means out bidding your competition by .01 isk. And sure thats a viable tactic, but it really isn't the only one.  I learned a lot about how markets move and how news can influence the trend of goods before things ever even change.  
---
There are times where someone messes up and adds or takes away a digit and those always bring a smile to my face. The biggest so far was 14b or so. That was only a few months ago. That was most likely the direct result of not manipulating by .01 and instead by 10001 or more. The person feels the need to match the numbers and raise it by .01 only to drop or add a digit. 
---
Some things move faster than others but the margins tend to dip more often on those. Either way its my way of enjoying Eve atm. I've done plenty of PvP and PvE and enjoyed all of it.
---
Where’s the piss bottle for when you run out of diapers?
---
Bro what in the fuck are you talking he's talking to Carbon Fury.  
---
Are you trying to see how wrong you can be in one post.
---
Also scorch hits out to 39km on a zealot.  Guess armor hacs aren't a brawling doctrine according to you.
---
T2 solo frigs is way more than 50 mil per hour. Even at 10 mil per site it only takes an average of 10 minutes to complete a single run max, so that's at least 60 mil per hour. And I average around 15 mil per site at least, so it's closer to 90-100 mil per hour.
---
I think my *lowest* ever T2 was around 7 mil in loot and that was very unusual. 10 minutes is including the time spent to drop off loot and start a new pocket; my normal completion time is 8-9 minutes, sometimes as low as 6-7 if I get lucky on spawns. My longest is 10-12 if I get a lot of battleships.
---
I haven't found a ship or fit that can reliably solo T3 so I don't do them. You have to either multibox or play in a group, both of which lower your actual isk/hour.
---
Every single reply you have made to people has contained some form of ad hominem. Yet you deny projection.
---
Lmao.
---
who is lasker again?
---
OMG! Your blog is what made me take the dive into eve! Thank you so much for your work on your blog :)
---
I don't think it's going to make people look at the game less, just read one less of the million windows I already have up, but that's still a good point.
---
Why do you think there are 2 mugs and nothing to drink? The huggies are so you can change your kids diapers and mine at the same time. 2 cups, 1 dude.
---
Wow dude, can you get any more cringy? Like p12 levels shit.
---
I have literally thousands of referrals into this game, so unless you have some statistic I have never seen about players who directly attribute quitting Eve to me, I'm not sure what you are talking about.
---
Ah the shit cup and the piss cup
---
rude as heck m8
---
No, you dont need billions any more, because the metaplasmid market has leveled out. anyway I just check on zkill to confirm and yes some people are in the ballpark for the fit I ended up with and I imagine those fits i see them using are lost by people who have nerfed their fit because of connection issues. those that might have my fit arent losing it, not that i can find at least, and they probably wish i would shut up if they knew i was talking about it. 
---
being able to complete the site isnt the point, the point is minimize the time and effort spent in the site, just like you would do in any farming operation. i know for a fact i can out dps race both sacrilege and a gila, and that this ship is the fastest possible way to take these sites down....to the point where it felt like i broke the game in some sense, even before damage low meta mods or new drugs.  im almost curious enough to resub just to see how disgusting i can get it now that those exist. . that is nothing to do with being a special snowflake, it's about heavily researching something until you have reached a conclusion, and having the consideration to keep it a secret for anyone else who did the same thing.
---
Looks like fun
---
The cringe is watching you struggle with how WH mechanics work then wave a bloody Titan killmail around as you cry.
---
The extended one has a base life of 3 days.
---
Ye cause its so hard to understand. Can you be more stereotypical? "Uhh I live in a WH, Im the best" Ugh dude, come on. Grow the fk up. And crying, do you even know what that is? Like outside of when your boyfriend leaves the bed without cuddling?:)
---
I'm fairly new to EVE.
---
I wouldn't say it's \*necessary\* but it seems like if you really want to make ISK/Ever use a super or Titan you need to. Like, a significant number of the things that our wiki and forum guides recommend the use of or involve multiple characters.
---
They also were last updated in like 2015 though, and probably were written during the fall of Rome so who knows though really.

Why did they even fucking bring eagles if they're just gonna use them like feroxes anyway

The sheer level of incompetency in nullsec groups is astonishing

If anyone questions it, just tell them it's for ceremonial purposes.

Vault icon in the neocom.

Plus HACs which out DPS and tank said battleships while being more agile and costing around the same. I'm looking at you, Eagles/Muninns.

I'm glad to hear that. I came back for the blackout. Not sure how long I'll stick around this time but I may post a couple updates to the blog soon.
---
No, Im insulting you by saying youre a little girly girl who cries alot. But not a bright girly girl  you know. Cause u dont know what crying really is.
---
See:)

Navy Raven. Best since 2008
---
Man Waffles sure triggered you haha. Dont worry man. Waffles has connections EVERYWHERE! We are always watching. Spia network so good.
---
 catching much easier in the blackout meta 
---
CCP changed the game to make it easier for you and you're happy about that, got it.
---
6 in the afternoon, but I'm always down to fuck.
---
Eve android version.
---
Looks good! Honestly the Caldari have my favorite aesthetic in the game.
---
See, not bright. But its okey, you probably have some other attractive traits:)
---
Waiting for someone to call Volta highsec scrubs again, anytime now team.
---
&gt;I dont get why many of the things people complain about are gonna change anything.
---
A lot of people don't look at the big pictures of things so their change "fix" their issue with "no consequence".
---
I'm curious how this process went.
---
Like the Galaxy is procedural, but are the sky oxes also procedural and then they say there like "huh...that area got a cloud ring..."
---
You should see my origami Dominix. Looks similar to this: https://www.improbable.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/crumpled_paper_1.jpg
---
Do you prefer to trade more so in volume or high quality items? Like ores for example vs. like blueprints or whatnot
---
It lets other ships refit when they are close to you, as if they had a mobile depot deployed, which is a pretty useful feature. However, you can't store any items in it besides a Minmatar shuttle, AFAIK.
---
Could use better formatting.
---
You shouldn't use subheadings to refer to who is speaking, but instead to seperate the conversation into subtopics.
---
SRP Token: Vily Fleet
---
The cap fight was over in like 5 minutes.
---
Confirmed that the effect of the accelerator expired while it was ingested and active. This is different than what was in the past events, where the effect of the accelerator would persist beyond its expiration time.
---
OMG, repair costs for miners....  the new mega-isk sink.
---
Yep honestly the worst part about Eve outside of citadels is any fucking forum it's players touch barring like the b4r sub.
---
Totally not pets btw
---
Banana launcher when?
---
Override nullified ships immunity with banana peels
---
Ye true. It feels like everyone is focused on fixing something that really cant be fixed, a balance between small and big gangs. But changing anything in that sense will mess up big gang warfare.
---
difference is when we fight their caps they got more caps than we got pilots in fleets, here they still got 3 times more pilots in fleet than we did, and we only had like 30ish carriers.
---
More like they dont understand 95% of what they r watching
---
It also dies in one carrier volley and takes a million years to activate.
---
Do it in many trips, don't break 150 mil/10k ehp if in a DST. Think occator or the like. (T2 hauler with fleet hanger)
---
If you have webs to get a freighter into warp, 2 bil should be ok.
---
Or better yet, have someone else do it. Courier contracts are great. If you want help, ask in the hauler's channel public chat
---
The depression of commodity prices (minerals, salvage, PI, etc. plus what is made from them) was not due to deflation but due to overproduction, especially versus too low a level of destruction.
---
It couldn't be deflation because money used for PLEX is exchanged, not destroyed.  Deflation happens because there isn't enough cash with which to buy, or a reason to buy, goods.  But lots of goods were still being produced and bought (caps, rorqs, keepstars, etc.).
---
:( buddy can’t bot anymore
---
If i was gonna bot id just run a virtual machine on my windows 7 pc. it takes nothing to run this game low res but it takes what i linked to run in full HD. Also im the only one that provided actual build advice but its funny how its still being downvoted. Really shows how shit this sub is.
---
This is what happens when the bomb misses. Yes, citadel guided bombs can miss small targets. When that happens, it will start orbiting the target at its max speed, but due to not slowing down it is hard for it to ever actually get to 0 on the target, so it just sits there and orbits.
---
It's funny how triggered goonies are over a WH corp.
---
Thanks very much Scorcher! I might have to just find a way to make contracts work. I imagine someone dedicated to hauling will have methods of ensuring safety I don't know about.
---
what?
---
Probably some new up-and coming war dec group, check the Merc section of the eve forums to see if they have posted an advert yet
---
Yep, that be a bus, you can tell from it's curves
---
Nothing about being elite. People gravitate to groups they like the sound of
---
They are available through the recruitment program right now, and are frequently given to CCP event attendees.
---
That will probably continue to be the case
---
it's funny how you believe that's an actual WH corp and not a bunch of PL/NC alts
---
I started with mid range prices and volumes. Then I moved into officer module trading. It's very long term and the capital needed is very high but the payouts aren't too shabby.
---
So what you're saying is you hang around urinals staring at everyone's crotch judging how they use their zippers?
---
Also your burns would have more bite if I had half a clue who you were
---
Why have most militaries of the world swap to swarm based tactics? Using calculated pressure does not work anymore IRL. It should not work in game either, yet that is what the entire game is based around... if CCP wish for null to not stagnate this needs to change. The basis for swarm based tactics is rooted in overloading an opponent so they cannot respond with the force they intend to. 
---
The exact reason that drifters were complained about is where doing something like this gets its strength. If you constantly face small cuts it causes fatigue. Fatigue causes mistakes. Mistakes cause institutions to fail. The strength of blocs comes from the time they have put into creating institutions that give line members a sense of normalcy. That is what smaller groups don't have. That is why this hits large blocs harder than small groups. If you create geographic, and political distance between line members, while forcing institutions to break down then things look very different from the perspective of that line member. 
---
While you are right it will just be a nuisance. If it is a nuisance for an extended period of time then it actually does something. 
---
Forcing a war fleet to respond to something so insignificant means that the next fleet will be smaller due to the lack of challenge. People get bored and stop showing up for rage pings if you do them to often. The tedium of everyday life kills empires. CCP have eliminated or players have automated a lot of that tedium over the years. It needs to be introduced again in new ways for things to change. This is a game where most folks relish in pvp, so adding it via pve instantly makes it tedious in their eyes, even if it is really engaging. There is a difference between being engaged with the game and being engaged with null politics. Right now there is no difference for a lot of people. Even the basic F1 monkey shows up because of the of politics.
---
I was similar to you, ex horde player looking for pvp and fw. After searching for a while I join Last Rites. 
---
A Gallente FW Corp in USTZ. Very active Corp, part of a large alliance that allows you to run larger ship ops if you want. 
---
It’s been amazing how many constant fights we have and every time I log there are players on. Smaller group but consistent.
---
The HS one was lost to 300 vs. 70 fight. V0lta took the fight. Now they fought outnumbered again and on better conditions.. they same conditions the big NS blocs alway require to win any fight. Fuck, Pandemic Goons, please ignore might still had more isk on field then those (again heavly outnumbered) V0lta + Snuffed.
---
Oh man... Imagine thinking who's in a corp changes the fact they're living in a WH or not.... Hahaha
---
Sweet just spend 5 years creating a new code that wont disrupt what you have to delay ESI/API pulls for 30 mins to 1 hours.
---
got it.  thanks.  yeah, i was looking at the standard one.
---
A 3% rapid launch and torpedondamage implamt might be worth it. It will put your pod over the cost of your ship but that's a good increase in dps
---
Eve sky boxes were generated o.O?
---
But it was SRP'ed :thinking:
---
I've seen people do this, play with the time of the bomb and they would chain a couple of bombs at once.
---
Bud, this is the company that deleted boot.ini.
---
There is always risk with CCP.
---
Missed this one but looks like it was a fun grid.
---
Can confirm it's a myth. However it's yet to be known how much ISK Grath will require in order to join Habit....
---
www.eveonion.com is where I get the latest and most accurate information about the game.
---
You saw who the fcs were right ?
---
As far as I can tell the only side that even had FCs was v0lta and snuff
---
Players don't want dominion sov.
---
They want a reason to fight for sov.
---
Right now every region in space is the same has access to everything anyone would ever need, in volumes that never previously existed.
---
There is no reason to go to war, to invade or take territory.
---
Dominion Sov didn't drive wars. Constantly changing resource procurement did. OTEC wasn't a thing because of Dominion Sov. It was a thing because Tech was a bottleneck, and there were 3 wars fought over it. In the span of about 2 years.
---
The thing about Fozzie Sov.
---
There hasn't actually been a "real" war fought using. Just a deep dicking of the beehive in WWB. Which occurred because, CFC got dunked by LS groups and everyone dogpiled the paper tiger because Fuck Goons.
---
Played with one account past 9 years, still do. Also most of the play time is on one character, but I use two: one for everything, second one for station trading and such. Even then, I don't even really need the second character, its just there for fun.
---
"Daddy Init, please come save us"
---
what kinda gila? 
---
karybidos is by far the biggest killer. you can spawn far away and if your a passive fit youll slowly die if you get huge web spawns and you dont pilot perfectly to spiral in while still kiting the webs
---
4 vedmaks are rare in t4 but can spawn, make sure you focus them asap and its not hard tho. hit F every 30s to make sure your drones stay on 1 vedmak, especially in vila rooms. it randomly swaps aggro against them for some reason
---
Don't sit on comms unless you need to for an actual fleet?
---
Deflation occurs when supply overshadows demand, as you say overproduction. It has to do with prices.
---
So is anything. Fail to see how that has to do with prices. 
---
Yes, the demand was lower than the supply. Which is the same as overproduction. Thats leads to deflation, i.e., we had deflation. The general price level was lower than the inflation, things got cheaper.
---
navy cruci is fun but most fights in it are decided the second the TD lands which is kinda boring
---
nice video as always  o/
---
Once saw a video that ended with a quote from a guy in Snuff it went something like "remember kids, blue is just a color".
---
Damn, I wish I was so good.
---
But keep that work up!
---
Also saving your comment for later
---
It is for sure a war porpoise!
---
Nergals can do t3 firestorms and a blingy garmur can do t3 darks alone. For the profits I was talking about doing them with 2 other people, as that's what I usually do. What ship are you running for t2?
---
Thank you! ^^
---
Yes, I love the Caldari to because I love the kind of hard edge design's!
---
bruh
---
Deja vu
---
I dont understand the instant flame and -karma recieved for asking what plans are in place for saving EVE as a brand and looking to the future? Thanks neckbeards I guess. :(
---
i like your vids samoth but the iki they way u use it seems so useless ... you basically deal frig level dps with a 1b+ hac , might aswell just fly a t2 fitted orthrus and do more dps or idk omen navy or something.  
---
correct me if im wrong i just dont see the reason to fly the iki in those situations with mystic/meson loaded
---
So for the non retarded:
---
Pubez sold out some targets to bombers bar and were kicked from requiem and have been waterboarded like Guantanamo bay residents since they started their evacuation.
---
:suprisepikachu:
---
What happen when you use proper spelling and grammar in a post title?
---
Not just multiplayer tbh.
---
Story time for no other reason than because I feel like telling it instead of doing the dishes...
---
Just this evening I've been playing Command and Conquer: Kane's Wrath, and one of the factions in it, the Scrin, have abilities called the wormhole and blink packs which allows instantaneous movement. 
---
I was playing against a brutal steamroller AI (aka, the AI cheats and pumps out massive amounts of Tier 3 units) and I was continually getting my ass handed to me as if I put all of my cash and units into building up the huge defences my base needed, as soon as the AI started building superweapons the only option was to restart the game as there'd be no way to push through the onslaught to get at their superweapon structures  before they fired... and superweapons are of course just causing huge damage at a particular spot (i.e. teleporting a big explosion on top of the players' head) and cannot be defended against.
---
If my defences did hold, after about 20 minutes the AI would start spamming shock troopers, infantry units that could use blink packs to teleport a certain distance. All the defences in the world count for nothing when the AI just teleports straight past them and pretty much one-shots every structure you have while your main units are holding the line against the rest of the attack.
---
About 30 or 40 restarts later, I tried playing as the Traveller 59 faction, they have the teleport ability too called the wormhole, which you can any type of ground unit through.
---
Then I remembered that the AI cheats, because it can see the entire map, it will instantly sell off any structure that an engineer gets too close to so it can't be captured.
---
Cue the development of a massively overpowered cheese move where all I had to do was open a 2000 credit wormhole next to their superweapon structure, and send a single 500 credit engineer through, and it was guaranteed to be instantly sold off and destroyed.
---
There was absolutely no way I could have broken through their lines, I could barely hold my own base, but thanks to instant, unstoppable teleportation, I could effectively destroy any structure I wanted for the loss of a single engineer.
---
Only then could I survive long enough to place the additional units necessary to defend against the enemies that would soon start teleporting straight into *my* base. 
---
Anyway, this is a story about how teleportation is overpowered.
---
have a look at https://eve-corps.com :)
---
As a returning  Eve player I too am Bergmann
---
Not everyone is a native English speaker.
---
Is the demand for those modules pretty high? Or are you sitting on trade deals for weeks?
---
What all does a production line entail for you? Happy to hear you’ve come back!
---
At least say its an Enforcer so it can whore on kills.
---
Looks like the pacifier, kind of.
---
There's **one** bee on that BR. Uno. Singular.
---
Who the fuck knows what Init was doing. They [shot our toasters](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ckar5l/i9gl1_battle/evli7y2?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) and then fucked with Winterco.
---
But hey, keep spinning.
---
ESL people don't use `u` and `ur`. It's something unique to teens and idiots.
---
Oh hey I was there for those
---
Hi waffles frens. We luv you
---
Almost the exact same thing happened to a Provi MJD Raven fleet hitting my Fort a few months ago. They were hopping around such that lots of bombs were in space but it was angled so they started clumping together. Wasn't a problem as long as they kept MJDing; they didn't. A bunch of the bombs landed in quick succession. It didn't wipe the entire fleet out but several I'd hit with missiles earlier in the fight hadn't fully recharged and got popped along with a few support ships.
---
Took me and my last out on a bombing run , took down 4 excavs and only lost 1 bomber. It ain't much to most.
---
I'm not sure, lol.  I've been fighting in FW, because I thought it was the best place to get a fair 1v1, but I ended up fighting faction frigs every time vs my T1.  
---
Some people said I had good fits, but it was for null rather than low sec.  So I fixed that.  Then I tried putting more tank on to survive longer and lost still.  I wonder if the faction frigates really do give that edge I'm lacking in these fights?  Two of them were close (I got the opponent ~50% into hull.)
---
If you are as helpful and useful as you seem to be you will probably get to know more important people through the business. Just being proficient at what you do an dbeing helpful in general will get you contacts and connections.
---
Yeah lol, we saw init head over to our fight so we messaged Pando and teamed up. It really isn't that weird that a bomber fleet joined in for this fight
---
[This](http://gomakesomething.com/ht/age/how-to-make-rusted-paper/) could be useful if you try your hand at something Minmatar.

Redundancy
---
People use those online regularly, what are you even talking about?
---
Theres a difference between not being a native speaker and producing sentences that are less understandable than what comes out of google translate.
---
When I was in a hauling Corp we’d use an orca. Fit correctly, they can hit around 1.3M EHP. Which, iirc, is about twice that of an actual freighter. You CAN still die in one, but we never lost one. 
---
Also make sure you’re in a Corp that can’t be war decked. 
---
And having an alt to web your freighter / orca is hugely helpful
---
Greed will get you every time
---
Could at least give a slightly better version :| TBH we mostly struggled with not having enough to screen the fighters, and you guys flew the carriers very well, very good fighter management and played it well. Was a GF.
---
They were nice kills. Well played.
---
We (well i was with Horde) did pause the timer multiple times, but even pinging from one side to the other, the fighters are just too fast and we kept bleeding logi. Once it repaired we headed home though, we didn't leave till that point :)
---
AH HAH YES SEE IF THEY CLOAK UP THE MOMENT YOU TRY TO FIGHT THEM, TRY AGAIN
---
AND AGAIN
---
And again
---
and again
---
^and ^again
---
What's this? They can just cloak up when a response fleet comes along and just avoid a fight altogether? 
---
STOP MAKING EXCUSES!!!1!
---
Hey, did you hear DnG is recruiting?
---
TBH it made for a really interesting fight. Shows how much of a force multiplier carriers can be when actually used/flown properly!
---
its funny the fit uses a bunch of under utilized rigs, implants, drugs and mods on a ship you would almost never consider using for pve, part of me wants to believe its a very cleverly crafted joke by the people who designed the abyss
---
You're absolutely sidestepping anything they say because you are inevitably fighting a losing position, which isn't helped by the fact that morons argue losing positions particularly poorly, eh?
---
Give me a plausible way that I can stop gatecamps without playing eve 12 hours a day.
---
ur gaypwned
---
Do what you will with cynos, but *you leave my Loki alone!*
---
Awesome, thanks Clay!

Hound has bonuses to explosion Dmg. Most of the ratting ships used are gallente and have an explosive esost hole
