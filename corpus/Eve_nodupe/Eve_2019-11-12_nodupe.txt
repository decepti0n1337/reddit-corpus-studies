To everyone upvoting this but are part of an alliance with more than 2,000 members: leave your bloc now. Join a smaller one. You're part of the problem.
---
Tikle was right
---
(for leaving the tapi cancer, they are wrong as an entity however)
---
Given how lazy ccp seems to be lately, the easy way is to just make a new module for HIC bubbles that kills boosh modules. They could play with the bubble size till it was in a good place for balance. They could do the same thing with interdiction probes if they wanted to make it something you could spam all over the grid.
---

---
What would be really cool is a deployable or maybe a battleship module that acted like a drag bubble for booshes. if boosh is activated within range of the anchored or active module, it takes you there instead of 100k ahead of the boosher. or even make it a burst projector charge.
---
The last thing eve needs is to have more things nerfed and simplified.
---
have you been on r/eve before?
---
No, It's by far the worst one I have seen so far.
---
My opinion is that people who wanted covert cynos for JFs either A) don't have JFs or B) have only 1 JF and don't know anything about pvp.  Both of those group's opinions on the matter should be not relevant.
---
I see.
---
Corp hq doesnt really mean anything as far as I know. Just where corp is made
---
New player not particularly interested in combat.
---
How can I get a mining, hauling, logistics experience with risk and social coordination involved?
---
I've been alternating between casually fleet mining moonrocks and space trucking. All in hi-sec.
---
Seems like I should join a big null-sec corp or see if redfrog or pushX would take me. Any advice?
---
Second question, can I have a good time without an alt? So many people talk about alts and Multiboxing.
---
Fake and gay.
---
you're *
---
Nothing in low sec or null is safe ever really. Especially alone in a slow aligning ship like a battleship. You're prime bait for a covops drop like you experienced
---
It was all planned at the BBQ, not in some random Discord room.
---
&gt;a 20-30m Caracal in T3s
---
If you could do that on video, I'd love to see it. I had someone in chat claim they had a Bellicose (the Minmitar version of the Caracal) in that price range that could run t2s semi-reliably, but I can't see how that is doable. I've attempted 5 t2 abyssals, and every time the t2's weren't even close.
---
So this is what rock bottom sounds like.
---
After I get done with this T5 series challenge accepted! I’ll try a bunch of cheap fits going from T1-T3. First I’ll try low SP alpha alts but for T3s I’ll definitely need to bust out the main XD 
---
I’ve done the Caracal in T3s on stream a bunch of times with the goal to make it to the Proving Grounds, following in the footsteps of the legendary Gatorgrips that took the same Caracal and killed 2 Gilas and ransomed an Ishtar for 1B. I successfully completed the T3s a few times however I never had the PvP success with it hahah.

---
if u dont have a spai in the upper leadership of your enemy are you really playing eve?
---
Me if you are going to nerf supers that hard I'd rather just get rid of them entirely and refund sp and find something to do with current supers (switch them into 10 carriers? Give you the minerals that it takes to build them in your redeem queue?)
---
..... no :)
---
This is really funny, nice try!
---
Literally unfuckingplayable.
---
these deepfakes are getting too real, wake up sheeple
---
Decent idea but I'd just pm my target and offer 100 plex if I can kill him.
---
A presumably larger defense fleet comes in and starts whittling you down? Sounds like it is balanced behavior. If anything, a defense fleet with more numbers not just clobbering stukas easily seems op in stuka'd favor.
---
It was there all along... should have stayed tethered.
---
You forgot that Goons, on their way to the fight, decided to turn tail and head home to leave their pets to get obliterated.
---
1 fax is equivalent to 5-6 dreads damaged with resists taken into account... So basically after 10 fax on grid we weren't doing fuck all. Was very disappointing having 70 dreads on a bus just hovering at 28% armour. Fax are still broke as fuck and should really just be removed. Spider tanked carriers were easier to kill than shit with fax

Happy cake day!

You need to, like, talk to your pets. Otherwise they don't work together well.

Insured the Raven. Came out ISK-positive personally. Good times.
---
Might as well before the nerf
---
Correct. Wasn't a secret to us that we all would die, lol :D
---
I think we all knew that; hence, we posted this in local: #INITSacrificedForDARKNESS
---
Well if recent events are to be believed, major wars don't generate much interest any more. They've become boring  since there really isn't any urgency and most wars are decided before the first undock. Look at the Southern War. Nobody cared at all. for all I know it might even be still going on, but who actually gives a crap about that? there may even be other null wars going on but absolutely nobody cares about it. Null is over. Low sec and faction warfare are broken. What can you even say about high sec other than it's more dangerous than null? Dotlan seems to confirm this.

The conga line was with IAC wasn't it?

So we're back to my initial statement that turnover is needed for prices to matter.
---
Hey, Unknown skill is my name too

Here I did these a while ago and the audio quality in the frigate one may not be perfect they may provide some use:

---
They are pretty long format lectures done for eve university.
---
Yes but again if price is the primary balance tool there won't be a lot of turnover.
---
I'm glad you called it a badger mk2 like it should be instead of a tayra
---
At least only one of them is blue lol.
---
Oh, I know this one! This has been my thing throughout most of the time I've played the game. I really dislike the PVE content available and so have monetized my PVP activities. I was lucky enough to do a lecture for eve university on the topic and have a video series of the same title. Here is the lecture:
---
On a side note, I'm pretty sure that Olmeca has an order of magnitude more alts than you're suggesting here, if his CSM election comments are anything to go by.
---
i heard T5 abyssals are decent isk however it is not an afk playstyle
---
How do they fare these days? They were basically legendary back in 2012-2014 or so.
---
&gt; Whats going on with the test server? 
---
Testing; that's what's going on with the test server.
---
No you
---
When people abuse the fuck out of the mechanic to use untouchable cancer ravens to bash structures or super long range comps that can effectively travel faster than any ship in the game is physically capable of without even having a prop mod, it gets nerfed.
---
Surprise surprise.
---
That's just because you already bash structures and want some loot for your effort.
---
For a Jump Raven (or Stuka) fleet to operate effectively, you always needed a minimum of 10-15 booshers or so. You're gonna tell me you'll put those 10 booshers in every single one of those? And of course, each group not only needs an anchor, but an FC to call out the MJDs. Are these 10 people gonna be in the same comms, talking over each other, or are you gonna split them all up into different channels? Either way it doesn't work, boosh fleets are effectively dead. If anyone could possibly make them work still, it would be Pando who de-facto invented the concept, and he just flew his last Ravens and Stukas yesterday.
---
Good guy Pando taking one on the chin for Guardians of the Botters
---
It takes 30 seconds to a minute to reship and warp to a new plex after you die. Can make 1 bil a week with a few hours a day.
---
Time invested is nothing, it takes 4 clicks to warp systems and enter the plex.
---
You can click warp and ship back over to your main
---
What are u actually doing when this is happening, u just warp die and repeat or what?

I am not getting those notifications, but I'm getting spam "your account is about to expire" emails from CCP. Not getting ingame mails in the EVE Portal app either (but was getting them immediately in the old app).
---
Why would you leave the cursor over the hull like a MONSTER?
---
Gives you the opportunity to downvote op multiple times when normally you'd only get one. Silver linings and all that.
---
bruw, just take less head start next time.
---
Dreads have a 5 minute siege cycle. So the shortest time they can be fighting is that one cycle. And yes hes saying multibox all 4 ships.
---
Thanks to everyone that helped
---
Dreads seige in a cycle of 5 minutes. Single cycling is only needing to seige once per site.
---
So you have a ~5min clear time. If you get the drifter as well you're pushing like 5b an hour or something stupid like that.
---
And yes. Or working with someone else. I don't really care.
---

---
So how much does the Null Sec Capital Blocs pay you guys to ruin any form of Sub-cap threat against their capitals. I guess you want Carrier Online not Eve Online, should we all go play Dreadnaught instead? Why in the fuck was the boosh changes needed? Did the CSM bitch and moan so hard that you guys caved or something.

Good bad old times, lasted 2 days. One of the secret stupid idea from CCP.
---
Please, not again.
---
\---
---
And about the chat window, well... I saw one time a video of the CCP office and they have like 31" monitors, probably ultra-wide or 4K... unlike the majority of players. So no wonder that they screw up things like that without options, AGAIN.
---
True, but when I typed that comment I was thinking of the characters I made a couple of years ago. I remember one of the career agents had you as bait in a venture, which (ideally) would mean you would clear out the rats with a drone or 2 instead of sticking a random blaster on the hull.
---
But, that option was stopped by an 8 or 9 hour skill train instead of the 20-odd minutes as it is now.
---
&gt; by spending multiple years of skill training.
---
LMAO
---
The bounty is paid out based on the value of what you kill, and it's a percentage. So in order to clear it you'd need to lose more than the bounty is worth.
---
Alternative facts?
---
I see how this is annoying, I am guessing CCP will fix it soon^(tm).
---
Maybe if Goons didn't tuck tail and run away like pussies you could have brought your own supers and the fight would have been a lot more fun instead of just ending in 1 minute when all the booshers got instantly deleted?
---
Ok boomer
---
[removed]
---
To be fair, the epic arc NPCs seem to have remained untouched since they were released. Case in point: that ship description was the actual Exequror description from before it got changed around 2012-2014. The standard mission NPCs seem more updated in general, though I think I've seen some seen some outdated things there too.

Perfect, team first degree humor arrived.

Your assets should still be there. If they were in player stations in nullsec, they will either still be in those or you will be able to "Asset Safety" them to a station in lowsec that you are able to access.

Skill points are now extractable via the use of Skill Extractors, which turns them into Skill Injectors that can be sold on the market. It's sort of a mixed field about how people feel, but regardless it does mean you can remove 'useless' skills on a character and reinvest them into something else, or simply sell them. [Here](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/207605005-Skill-Extractors-and-Skill-Injectors) is the support article about it.
---
Yeah, I have noticed every game here does have those warnings.
---
But I wasn't sure if it was just because I didn't play those games outside Korea...
---
Damage goes left to right lor your ship too. Same for drones now. It definitely makes more sense.
---
And the rectangle health bars and overlay that pop up when you mouse over are better than the rounded edge ones that were there before.
---
Are you Korean?
---
only what they do is relevant, what they "view" themselves as isn't relevant when we're talking concrete actual playstyles. By that metric init members would also not be a bunch of turbokrab forum warriors, but alas we're hit with reality.
---
Im confused Which one is Horde?
---
That's what confused me about why he would laugh so much at a super's fallen. Just like you said, it isn't the first titan made by AF.
---
Too late, there's already too many people invested into them to nerf them that hard. There'd be people leaving in droves again.
---
&gt;typically i'd be sad about small scale supers dying to the blob... but its tapi so im not
---
too much salt bro.
---
Don't use the Korean localization client, and continue using the English client? It's pretty obvious you speak English.

Honestly I am too at this point. I also didnt have more news at 11 so I apologize for that

Why have I been playing EVE for 12 years and today after downtime I've been met with unskippable screens telling me that I have to be over 18 to play EVE (I'm over 30) and notifications I can't turn off telling me I've been playing EVE excessively after only one hour of play???
---
U mean more than the already do ?
---
&gt; Blocked. 
---
How long have you played EVE? 12 years you say? And you cannot handle some meaningless flame on r/eve? 
---
I honestly do not know how you have handled the actual game for so long. Do you just immediately block everyone you see in local?
---
isnt it the guristas who are kin/ther locked
---
So you block anyone who points out your stupidity? Ooh, ooh, do me next!
---
First try it with RLML Caracals.  Then upgrade to Osprey Navies.  Then upgrade to Orthruses.
---
It depends on what you want.  If you want to focus on industry, you need to be close to whatever market hub you are selling at.  If you are going to focus on mining, pick somewhere quiet where you can eventually get some 0.5 moons.  If you are mainly doing missions, pick a system with a L4 agent.  Etc, etc, etc.
---
Lol. I'm not a boomer. I find both boomers and millennials equally annoying since they are just the old an new version of the same thing. Basically, millennials ARE the new boomers and they can't stand each other.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but there isnt much of a speed difference at all between orthrus and vigi is there?
---
wrong Region. They glassed Tribute, nothing more. This is Venal &amp; Tenal we are talking about. Inform yourself before talking.
---
&gt; It should need support to do so.
---
welcome to eve where that doesn't mean gudfites, but more alts, which means more people doing risk averse shit to fund extra alts and playing extra safe.
---
Have fun being hunted and camped 23/7.
---
Wish i had this problem haha
---
cause your 120k sp toon could be a 130k sp toon!
---
Dude, I can't even find a good corp let alone do anything else. That's just do to time zones and my availability. There are other things besides mechanics that hamper play. there are broken mechanics but there are more mechanics that have been gamed to stupid levels. Also, 1 v blob is not game play.
---
Username checks out.
---
Yeah shit is hella broke for some of us as well. Throwing can related errors when opening the industry interface even though i can just open the can in the corp hangar. 
---
&gt;You have been denied access for the following reason: You require take access to open the container requested.
---
Starting a BP from the can throws the error and renders only have the industry screen haha. 
---
Seems to only affect people without directors roles though. Directors can do everything just fine.
---
For lowsec I would go dual osprey navy and for null hyper AC cyna.
---
What I think he means is why bother with a dead game
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
Just a couple questions about pvp.
---
Aside from cost restraints and plex restrictions, why would one fly a frigate instead of, say, a cruiser?  What types of ships would be in a small gang in nullsec?  And how many of those would be logi, and how many ewar?  What ship types are typically flown in nullsec?  Are DPS and tackle ships different?  When roaming with &lt; 3 people, are you going to want tackle ships or combat ships?
---
My toons are all directors in my own little Corp. I am using citadels that are blue with me.
---
I mean if you've only been playing for 12 years how can they know you are over 18?
---
I'm not sure why this game hates industrialists and miners so much. I can understand not liking kinds of game play but EVE has gone to truly toxic levels. I don't enjoy mining and I can't find a reason to make things anymore but I don't feel a need to force players out of a game because they don't play like I do.
---
wwww Russia
---
Lets imagine a situation in which loki cant break through the tank of victim but tengu can cuz it have a little bit more dps due to 1 more launcher slot
---
As a instructor in Korean newbie guide channel 뉴린이 아카데미, there was 40-50 active players before update. Well, now there is about 300 players, and flood of questions make me hard to reply all :(
---
Ccplz give all of us hourly reminders to go have a real life xD
---
would be cool with the localization to get another AU tz entity up and running that strictly does PVP no krab. Like an asian snuff or TISHU or something to disrupt the status quo of the current AU alliances
---
&gt;not resubbing because you can't do a shity isk/h with your titan
---
Each of those ideas has more merit than just "it would be fun". But keep on being salty. You do you. =)
---
Visually it makes sense. The bar depletes from right to left, so with the new drone and watchlist the health of all three deplete from right to left in order.  
---
Why did they do it? Prob to fuck with botters.
---
Don’t do it in high sec. it’s a waste of time. Move to provi. It got all the creature comforts of high sec but the income of null.
---
Ooh, how about filtering out by standing?
---
&gt; That was a ridiculously vague posting by CCP
---
No, that was just CCP *not* giving you a HOWTO on the exploit. And what /u/Sedarof said.
---
&gt; Still not entirely sure on the point of the nerf
---
[Well, for one, this was broken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc4dxh0gEPw)
---
I want to be omega only 1h/day and price adjusted accordingly 😏
---
If that is not possible why this warning?
---
The increased dps my not make a difference when the target is calling for backup and the blob is coming. You may run out of time no matter what.
---
With the Loki you should be able to disengage easier than a tengu. That is a big advantage.
---
6 one way and half dozen the other. What is great about the game is there is no one size fits all. You must know your limits, the other ship's limits and make a decision the the moment.
---
Lol. I'm amazed at the level of effort that went into a post about an issue that takes less than 5 seconds to resolve.
---
Good.
---
Ya but then they count to your characters sp.
---
Well you’d need a really big system as with the proposed changes you would have 20-25 seconds before the boson starts firing, and a travel Loki can cross a 50 AU system in about 11 seconds
---
I have a feeling that the titans banned for botting was the main pilot of the bots or they were sitting in a different ship from what they bot in
---
Loki hands down.. Even a heavy missile loki gets to dictate range. Let's see loki pros
---
Webs, damage type selection, plain faster. Extra dps doesn't matter when it's locked to kin and no webs..
---
Did I mention webs? 25k web is pretty niceee. And extremely hard to ignore.
---
Tengu pros
---
Uh.. Tank?  it's not as neut resistant as you might think.. Any heavy neut will kill any t3 almost hands down.. Unless your full passive it kinda a moot point.. Altho not having the webs gives you a spot for a battery..
---
But still the loki webs honestly trump.. Anything the other t3s can muster its the king at the moment for a reason.
---
Make your own ammo, it's a LOT cheaper
---
Good dino.
---
I don't get how a change like this could sneak in all the sudden. But thank you for fixing it :)

---
highsec mining corp is a direction in the sense that a car is traveling in "some" direction as it crashes into a wall..
---
thought process for highsec mining corps is usually: wouldnt it be cool if people mined for us &gt;&gt; lets help some newbrows mine for us &gt;&gt; this is boring &gt;&gt; waste of time on all the administrative &gt;&gt; dead corp
---
i recommend a full supply chain as a direction if you are going to highsec mine. even without the PVP toons it at least gets more activities into the pipeline for the corp: EX: PI, Research, Marketeering, Mining, Production, etc.
---
I never said any others require that level. Maybe more should. Actually, not maybe. More *should* require that level of balancing/effort. Squads and wings should be more utilized. Separate comms should be more utilized.

We bombed hard even before booshing. It isn't a death of it, just reverting to old tactics.

Was a fun fleet, died in a fire when they counter dropped 3 gates toward home. Laughed my ass off as a dozen titans appeared. Will happily lose a nightmare again.
---
Do the career agent missions. The epic arcs are pretty good too. After that I would fit up an exploration frigate and venture out into dangerous wormhole space where you can make 5-100 mil per data or relic site with your lowly frigate. You might die to other players a few times but that's part of the game, and the isk you make will more than make up for it.
---
Look for a guide or video first, they'll show you what you're looking for and how to navigate wormhole space.
---
Because a weapon that does 600 total damage to an interceptor with mwd on apparently should still be called Doomsday weapon... rofl.
---
r/eve is well known as being haunted by the petty ghosts of former eve players.
---
Yo, you have great vids and always taking fights.  I always recommend new lowsec people watch all your vids because they are an excellent primer.  Keep up the great work, one of the best content creators Eve has imo.
---
Define: "Actual Fight"
---
Not missles
---
the 1 mil skillpoints could only be awarded if you had an active omega sub if I'm not mistaken.
---
And I specifically mentioned WITH sponges. 
---
If you have 3 sponges at 150m/hr which is extremely common, you're looking at 600m/hr. Let's say you have 2 sponges at 100m/hr and it's going pretty slow. That's still 300m/hr for literally jumping into a gate and afking while you hit f1 on another character.
---
Unfortunate loki is better due to having drones and better slot options. And that's before you even compare stats.
---
Ah.
---
CCP "We've made it so that you're required to participate to receive a payout"  
---
Also CCP "We've found out that the system we put in place to make a mechanic work a certain way, and as such, instead of dedicating resources to fix the problem, we're going to punish the players because our system isn't working as intended"
---
Players: So is sponging OK or not?
---
CCP: Yes.
---
I’m on my way home from work to see how abysmally shitty my erebus boson is on assault frigates and HACs.
---
Which were the couple of changes. And now how many nerfs? This year alone, how many? And also, lifeblood, I specifically remember how NS was saying no. Everyone else wanted it because they said "ugh blocs getting afk isk, no we want ships to mine it so they are vulnerable". 
---
The blackout could never work because it was broken. Pure idea wise it could never work to have the same local as in WHs since you cant close gates. You want us to have the ability to close our gates whenever we want? Sure thing, then remove local. 
---
Do I believe a middleground could be found? Ye most def. But that wasnt what people were screaming for and that certainly wasnt what we got. Result, people left. Because as you say yourself, nothing was buffed. Not that it would have worked with that iteration of the blackout either, it was too broken.
---
My man, I can agree to nerfs to safety if that same nerf goes towards roamers aswell. Cause right now I just see bunch of people that warp around and never take fights. Cloaky ships and nano everything. Thats not content for anyone except for the ones flying those ships.
---
Heres the thing, everyone just cares about their fun. That doesnt work. If you want content, then you have to deliver some yourself. Thats a mentality issue and too many are just too selfish to even consider being content for others. But they constantly want others to be their content.
---
You see why some might have issues with that? 
---
And before you argue how the blackout was otherwise I would like to point out that the meta shifted to cloaky ships right away. And that excavator kills spiked massively. That shit isnt about content for anyone except the minority.
---
So?
---
AF = lolol
---
yeah, that sucks.
---
Anyway, praxis is much better, unles you are stupid like me and put a Large shield booster instead of an X-Large ( way to waste isk ~~ )
---
Got capacitor issue though, on the last wave if I spawn lots of destroyers ~~
---
So you get reduced inject sp...
---
I bought the starter pack a while ago. For some reason I thought they didn't count if it was unallocated. So I have been hoarding them. Looks like I have some SP spending tonight!
---
never not loki
---
No you dont
---
That.
---
So perfect security and zero risk? Got it.
---
I don't understand what's so difficult about dealing with risk when you're living in some of the most dangerous parts of space.
---
God forbid you should need scouts on gates to watch your back.
---
They need to get over it. I took capitals out and welped and was right back to leading fleets like I normally do. People get too caught up on pride
---
Really depends on who is pinging and what...
---
No!

Hating industrialists does not equal hating krabs.  Krabs want safety to just krab all day.  Industrialists acknowledge the pursuit of wealth implies risk and loss.  They both die the same, but krabs bitch about it.  I respect industrialist and want to eradicate krabs.

Go try it then mate.

I have over 100m sp I have over 1m to inject as unallocated. I can inject the full amount without penalty. You only get penaltys on injectors  not unallocated sp.

As a conterpoint to what is said about mining : yes it is dull, but it is not meant to do solo or while being active on the game. Let me explain:
---
you can mine, or mine in hsec, but see that as a side occupation while oding something else (like watching netflix) or, and this is important, talking shit on comms with your corp. Do not under-estimate coms and pve group activities
---
Notice the 1m sp in the screenshot. Context matters. That event != the most recent event.
---
I imagine you'd lower your blood pressure a bit if you learned how to read.

It's almost like I said reduced inject sp...
---
There's two ways to do this:
---
1) You light the cyno next to the acceleration gate and walk your Sin over to the target (requires 3+ alts or a target who isn't paying attention -- which happens).
---
2) You set a bubble trap at the most likely warp out location (probably the biggest or closest citadel) and intentionally spook them into warping out and into the trap. 
---
Both ways are really difficult. I know people who can pull it off but I haven't personally had much luck.
---
Yes you can.

That was the last good war in Querious.  And the beginning of the end for ole FIX.

I was titan ratting in a -.1 truesec system with only 2 rock havens at around 100-120m ticks with like 5 button clicks ever 4 minutes.  Maybe the mega population of regions like delve worked against you nerds here, but honestly the sparse systems like the ones in provi were superb and I made a pretty substantial amount of isk with almost no effort.  So from my experience the pve nerf was where it was aimed. But whatever, I think it's a weird nerf regardless of pve or pvp focused that won't change the landscape very much.

l know that .. but hes no boat l miss my Jumping Squeaky Bee wearing boat and the WW2 references were am they .... lol

I'm amazed sp hoarding is apparently an actual thing.
---
Let alone - whatever kind of hoarding this is. Redemption hoarding?
---
I guess I can sort of see the value of having sp lying around ready to go in case you need it for something right this second later - but why *wouldn't* you at least redeem it?
---
Are people actually this lazy or am I completely missing the point as usual?
---
Even if that were the case, it would take them about as much time to adapt to that as it has taken me to write this comment.
---
I have dipshit. It doesn't work like that. It doesn't even make sense what you're saying.
---
what lol.... I fail to see how putting titans directly next to targets is problematic.  I assert the problem wasn't that the weapon was dangerous and unbalanced, but rather that the umbrella and megablobs that people use to justify safely using them haphazardly are cancerous.
---
why do you call it 300m/hr when it takes 3 toons thats still 100m per toon.
---
Could the font size option apply to the conversation panel as well as the member list (on a per channel basis)?

Literally everyone else gets it, so you might want to take a remedial english class.
