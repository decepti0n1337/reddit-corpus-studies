Could've been a Telia issue.  Doing a traceroute they seem to be the last thing before the datacenter and if they fucked up (which... has happened, I remember them being super flaky for another MMO, years ago), maybe they triggered a block or something on some systems.

you are correct and I am a retard.

how about you come fly with us?

alors, pas mal jouÃ© contre malediction, mais il serait plus difficile d'attraper un meilleur pilote. t'as Ã©teint ton mwd quand il fallait le surchauffer, scram et web aussi doivent Ãªtre surchauffÃ©s pendant qu'on s'approche. aprÃ¨s tuer le malediction, tu aurais pu orbiter le stabber sous ses tourelles et abattre ses drones, c'est nÃ©anmoins comprÃ©hensible que tu n'as pas pu penser clairement. tu serais mort quand mÃªme, probablement, sinon Ã§a serait un dank frag.

---
je n'ai aucune idÃ©e pourquoi tu inclurais ta rencontre avec le kestrel afk donc aucun commentaire.
---
finalement ce n'est pas trÃ¨s bonne idÃ©e de brawler un destroyer dans une frÃ©gate. sabres ne portent jamais de l'artillerie, donc il n'est pas utile d'essayer a les orbiter tout fermÃ©. cependant ils sont faciles a Ã©chapper quand ils sont seuls, encore plus avec scram, web et afterburner.

alors merci pour cette version de nightcall que je ne connaissais pas, et dÃ©sole pour des erreurs linguistiques

Oh yeah that's so funny, you come it's -10vs -10 and you start to see some sunderer coming in, then few tank, then it's one of the major keypoint of the map and everyone is here having a bloodbath :D

the pain is real.

I believe the 1051 refers to the number of times he has logged in under that account (all time).

A single isk is worth quite a bit.  Just not profitable from a casuleer perspective.  (I've checked into it already)

It is allways relevant and so painfully true.

Last night I disconnected like 5 times, 4 of which I was docked and the 5th was when I undocked. My overview would never load rarely when I jumped a gate and I'd get close to crashing.

The only thing worse than botting is being so bad at botting that you need your hand held.

Escape Menu -&gt; General Settings -&gt; "Experimental Features" in lower left -&gt; Uncheck the tick box.

If you're ganking ratters you can use the [NPC Kills Delta feature of DOTLAN](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Fountain/J5A-IX#npc_delta). If you're going around FW or whatever there's the Ship/Pod Kills layer.
---
This is the way.
---
Set course for Tama in something slow. There you will find the PvP you have been searching for.
---
I would like to point out that Minmatar Flipped treaty systems and that Amarr treaty signers did not defend them, because it expedites the cash-out and starts the greed cycle for Minmil LP grabs now.
---
I agree that since the ECM changes, the only real use for it would be in large scale fleet fights if the FC would want to divert DPS to griffins rather than the main doctrine. I'd say that the role bonus you mentioned would be a bit overpowered but it does make sense.
---
I don't like it. It's too watered down to be EvE. But its too complicated to be a fun time waster on my phone. Seems like its just caught in a bad place
---
Wow!! Thought you would never make it out alive. So brave!
---
Magic merlin!!! Best of luck man. Keep at it and you'll do good.
---
You can do industry as an alpha. But mining is gimped. You can fly a venture but cant go higher in industrial ships. I dont know much about it. But download eve, find a corp (they will need things built) build what you can and see how you like it.
---
&gt; its not going to drive the same kind of content
---
It didn't drive content, it lead to groups being stomped into the ground because you literally can't fight back when your enemy can reship every time they die with no consequence.
---
I was raised by darkness, no one to hold my hand and I made my own fortune by selling fedos and gambling - this is the way.

OK so the curse Russians are either doing mission running or the group that knows how to pvp. Just go for "prevyet kak dila?" you can copy paste the Cyrillic words in the in game note pad. )) is happy face. The : is too far in the keyboard so they do)  or)).  
---
I had joined Red alliance as an English Corp and really tried to learn their lingo  eventually I started to learn russian. Just speaking Russian to them in English words they like that you are trying to speak to them. That goes for all the languages.
---
Sweetheart, this is a hobby. You people are my toys.
---
Back when I played and was a new(ish) player this is how I got into the Corp I stuck with for most of my Eve life, and even met a few of them IRL. I scanned down a Level 4 mission runner and ninja'd all his salvage, he had like 3 Domi's in there with him. I convo'd one asking if I could have some loot and didn't get a reply, so I aligned, stole some shit and warped out.   
---
An hour later he messaged me, I had convo'd one of his multibox alts and he invited me to corp aha
---
Tons of fun Panfam, tad gutted we couldnt escalate into a full capital brawl. Maybe next time ey?
---
I, IveFinishedLurking, here by sign this petition to nerf thera
---
This is bait.
---
Slightly more detail:
---
TAPI blued everyone, and evicted everyone who didn't bend the knee. Sources have indicated they're in talks with Ranger Regiment regarding a NIP to help make their Impass holdings that bit more safe.
---
Your concerns about getting criminal will not mind you after a some time, it is not as bad as it sound.
---
If you don't pod people you can stay not being criminal, doing some pve or buyng clone soldier tags will keep your security status above -5. Even being a pirate you still can **move** in HS. Personally I never did, my char is dedicated to PVP.
---
After a time you are going to stay in lowsec with an arsenal of ships and modules, going to Jita for one ship will not be practical anymore. 
---
High sec is not profitable compared to lowsec or other areas. And you have two characters more, keep them able to go to high sec for ships, trading, exploring... You are going to farm in lowsec too.
---
I would join a "big" corp or aliance, you'll learn PVP, they will have logistics to lowsec, they'll teach how to live there in a confortable way.
---
All those drawbacks, security status &amp; standing loses are not forever, you can recover them if you want.
---
One last warn, once you try the blood you'll be hooked for years.
---
Big F for the Panfam jackdaw fleet that didnâ€™t fly so good
---
Take a peak at the numbers
---
"Misplaced comma"
---
oof, this is a question that should have been asked many months ago. I do not know about goonies and test but I would assume they gate Rorq mining behind an application process. 
---
You can not just join a corp and have access to there Rorq fleet on day one.
---
As for who is better: Goonies have the most uptime on their Rorq fleet, PH has the safest, join Test if you want a middle ground.
---

Rogue University is a good place to start imo.
---
Ahah  
---
I remember that very well.  
---
I wasn't yet a JF pilot, but i remember it. :)
---
Now account in how many of those 17 rorquals died because they were idiots, instead of failing to be saved.
---
You'll want t2 guns and at least bs4 + all the support skills for the shak to not be completely useless
---
Meanwhile the 1 rorqual in TKE died because he was retarded - so let's consider it 0 rorquals dead in TKE. Therefore mathematically goons have lost infinitely more rorquals than poo horde, works both ways buddy.
---
Here we were having a convo and you had to come REEEEEEEEEEEEE on it
---
Ok retard
---
Just give us your username and password, we'll help you transfer your homeworld to trinquility assets)
---
Just an add on, warp scramblers turn off microwarpdrives (MWDs) but MWDs give a much larger speed boost than afterburners. It's a trade off but each have their merit.
---
https://evepraisal.com/a/oknjk
---
So it definitely exists in ESI and pricing can be pulled for markets. evepraisal doesn't give you quite the flexibility you needed but the principles have been put in place by CCP. I have no characters in Black Rise but I bet if you eyeballed the markets you'd find some. Not a convenient way to source parts across multiple regions though.
---
Then don't do JFs.
---
Magically teleporting stuff around new eden with zero effort is not a healthy gameplay anyways.
---
And that's a Bee advice ! :D
---
Jokes on you I rorqual mine in M-OE88
---
Simple really timers are to late in the eve day. We move up the content dies we tackle shit and try to form and move up the fight will be ended by downtime by the time we are there
---
I'm a returning player and I've read that VNI has been nerfed since I last played. I figured Domi was a way to go. Previous I would sentry fit it shoot at range. Is that still the way to go? Appreciate and tips and fits.
---
Bad example lol
---
By this point, is there any real distinction between Bastion/TNT/LAWN and CONDI? INIT. at least has its own region. But those three alliances live in Delve.
---
I wish I had someone to roam W-space with and to teach me how things work out there. On my own I'm sorta spookied out of going in, so I never have.
---
This is the best recruitment post in a very long time. Shall many good players come your way!

Last weeks haul of reports on relic bot asteros https://i.imgur.com/3lso3dg.png

I was in PGGB for over a year. They are a bunch of risk adverse wiener dogs. Their leader is a gigantic pussy, aka a teacher in highschool, who pretends he's some widely known entity of greatness spewing love and compassion around a video game based on war (JR puts MR Rogers to shame). They have coasted in their 5&gt;3 for years never threatened. It's time imo for their loot pinata  to be salvaged and put to use by people who can actually play the game.  Pixel collectors are by far the MOST RETARDED type of person on Eve. YES,  ---&gt; RETARD &lt;--- ALL U FGTS THINKING CALLING SOMEONE A RETARD ISN'T AN INSULT ARE RETARDS YOURSELF!
---
Half of the HS WH campers that wouldn't venture more than 10k from a HS WH exit joined pggb shortly before I quit, you all know what corp im talking about. Not only did PGGB have a huge group of pussies running the corp, they added about 20 more super pussies to fully set the culture to its permanent pussy standard. The cool small group i originally joined turned into a conglomerate of gigantic blubbering vaginas. Once I left PGGB I had 42+ billion assets stuck in their home. Obviously as my killmail describes they looted all the goodies from all previous members  as well as mine.  Again based on the pussy antics they have shown their days are numbered. They cant defend themselves no matter how big the force is that shows up to evict them. Plus you'll have the piloted caps I have to help the process go extra smooth ;)
---
It's quite obvious someone has a handsome reward to collect from these worthless kids. In the event it happens I'd be happy to log my 2 caps in to help murder the idiots.

My suggestion is to get rid of the weapon rig. Itâ€™s costing you fitting space for not much gain.

Gallente Battlecruiser lvl 5 and all subskills
---
which  are those subskills??

I never claimed otherwise, I just thought that comment was ironic from a GSF member

Shhhh Don't let them know. It will sort itself out

---
I've not encountered any of those yet, but i've only been an explosive recruiter for a short period of time as well.
---
Both are viable.
---
Rail and Nano is more often flown in gangs. This scenario helps mitigate the worse tracking somewhat since you can hang around further from your target.  
---
Not saying it cant work solo, but it certainly leaves something to be desired. It is pretty slow and tracks badly at long point range.   
---
An AC cane with a med neut will probably work better as a long point BC kiter. 
---
Blasters and neut is used more in solo PVP and is of little value in a gang.
---
The money is in burners (Anomic Agent, Anomic Team) which you do in frigates. Either really blingy frigates or you multibox.
---
You get standings up by doing faction appropriate Cosmos missions plus Epic Arc.
---
That was one impressive fight. Four hours in tidi but well worth it
---
Congratulations, bennyboy0227!!!
---
Here's a proper suggestion: if you don't have the patience to haul then don't haul. It's not anyone's fault but your own that you didn't have supplies setup for your JF route.
---
?  
---
My post is not about not having my 'supplies setup' ?  
---
It's about setting the supplies setup.  
---
wtf ?  
---
You should tell me if there are any ways to set up a supplies setup by not setting it up myself.
---
Data and relic sites are often the most difficult wormhole anoms of their class. Unless you're in a C13 Wolf-Rayet system you will need something much more sturdy than a frigate to clear them.
---
&gt; The only capable russian group these days is Siberian Squads that live all the way up north in Branch.

Okay retard

It's not (source: done that lol)

Worthless to try another time. :)

Have a nice day.

holy CPU batman. Yeah I wasn't thinking about the XLSB; but then the last time I looked at a lowclass Gnosis it was LSB, capstable, Alpha-friendly. (Which can be done.)

But yeah at that point just fly a Praxis... even though Rapid Heavy reload is annoying.

He then went on like a 5 minute tirade calling us every name in the book.

I see, but what about the rest of what I wrote, is there any sense in it?
---
Cant see your locked targets what a shitter
---
Something that really intrigues me is the idea of flying through lowsec with the express purpose of baiting a ganker into attacking me thinking I am a weak target, and then surprising them with a formidable battle. I don't have anything against gankers, but the surprise would be fun. I have heard of the famed Battle Procurer. But are there any other nasty little surprise ships that anyone has had success in this area with?
---
Well, how much Community-Managers they got left that could inform us?
---
So with the vast amounts of context you gave us. I think the best explanation is: 
---
"You must be located in a station to use this service"
---
Quit while you're behind.
