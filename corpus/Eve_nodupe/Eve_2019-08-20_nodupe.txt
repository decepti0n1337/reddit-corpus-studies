With all the bellyaching about Capital Proliferation, All sorts of cancerous gameplay brought on by the newest ships classes and the inability to balance the meta. Making stuff much more simple seems like a good idea.
---
---
---
Oh I wish RnK would actually come back and pipe bomb.. not a ex RnK but an actual RnK
---
Random length to DT. 30 seconds to 12 hours!
---
This is very much how I feel.  Balance passes on local, cynos, and caps have all been necessary, but the complete nerfs weren't a good direction.  Small iterations to move us towards a more fun game with plenty of targets would have been better.
---
Splitting the playerbase sounds like a good idea yeah. if you want to kill the game completely.
---
Diplomat
---
So... counterpoint.  It's a lot of fun to hunt and kill PvE capitals.
---
Triglavian ships are amazing.
---
CCP should at least make them not terrible.
---
A few fights I recorded from the couple of weeks, mainly to start learning how to edit videos. It's mostly Kikimora footage but there are a few interesting moments, mostly where we help delay the goon response long enough to secure the Hel kill.Apologies for the Music, youtube madmins wouldn't let me have any of the songs I wanted.
---
Good stuff! As usual!
---
A few capital fights from the last few weeks - mostly stuff I recorded to practice video editing with. Its generally Kikimora's but theres some interesting bits in there, like delaying the goon response long enough to secure the Hel kill.
---
Elaborate?
---
Sure, gramps. Let me translate: Claiming all structure/POS bashes are done for the same reason is stupid.
---
We have alts...
---
Common!
---
I'm still in shock.
---
Props for including fights with major fuckups. Then again, there'd probably be no fight left to show if you didn't.
---
No, this was a good change.
---

---
More frequent/longer lasting wormholes were mostly abused by the already large blocs to exert their influence further and dominate far away regions.
---
We need more regional conflict not less, if your group has no content because it blue'ed all of your neighbors for three regions over then you should starve for content.
---
I could be on-board with this if the allowed mass was restricted to the point that you couldn't just blob some random alliance across the game with 250 frigates, but that basically makes the holes unusable anyways.
---
As a beam laser boat, you will want to keep transversal to minimal.
---
You’ll save isk doing it all yourself but you’ll save time buying it. What do you have more of?
---
It really does though. Once you have an enormous amount of sp you run out of things to train, thus the sp having less value.
---
Time,definitely.
---
He could have make 1 rep cycle before being neuted out, but that wouldn't change the fight.
---
Imagine needing to opsec dread fits in 2019
---
fyi, you can shift+click on module to overheat, don't need to try click that little green arc on top.
---
Then doing it yourself is probably the better option.
---
Let me clarify: Marauding super fleets going around reffing entire pos "to wave their dicks" is a fevered delusion of your pubbie mind
---
T1 hulls get used plenty.
---
Before my time and first I have heard about it (joined latter 2014).
---
Make some noise.  They seem to be listening a lot more of late.
---
Your wrong, people are telling you and you’re not listening.
---
The lifespan heavily impacted large nullsec groups usage of them though.  
---
Large blocs like PL/Goons have enough members that if they just keep track of the wormhole connections using API's they can use them hours later to help plan the fastest route from staging to any target.
---
But this is like saying that minerals you mine are free. They aren't, they still have value, they still have opportunity cost.
---
Um. No? They didn't? They were built on the backs of mindless bot-aspirants who only play how they are told to.
---
Just like your failing country.
---
I guess it depends on the scale of your production. Buying minerals always means paying someone else for their effort. But if you can produce much more than you can mine for yourself you'll probably make isk much quicker by buying what you can't mine.
---
This is been bothering me for some time and I feel much better knowing it's part of blackout
---
Does shift-click activate and overheat at the same time or just overheat?
---
That's not how it works.
---
Correct / wrong marks are only on the test sheets.
---
Thanks for watching
---
You marked something as transit, that wasn't a transit in database.
---
Absolutely. Hopefully by the time I get through 100 tormentors, I'll be a little bit better.
---
Hm, that's a weird one, the "correct" answer is clearly moved out of the center there.
---
only overheat
---
Neither side should get final say in when timers end.
---
In a perfect world, we would be able to fight over them piecemeal.  
---
Just land on a button, whoever ends with control of it gets to push the timer back or forward x% of time with diminishing returns for each button capture.
---
Nice video! always interesting to see fights from another fleets perspective. And oddly satisfying to see such a video and being able to say "I was there" (except for the goonie hel :( )
---
we do not want, but CCP is doing all for make it dead
---
They have issues, but they are *way* better than POSes.
---
Take a screenshot with your probe window open
---
No
---
HOLD ON MOTHERFUCKER, IF MOST WORMHOLERS **ARE** UTTER MORONS HOW CAN WE MAINTAIN THE NARRATIVE THAT NULLSECCERS ARE BRAINLESS/BOTS/F1MONKEYS

YOU SIR ARE A LIAR AND A HERETIC. THERE IS NO PROBLEM THAT CANNOT BE SOLVED WITH A MOBILE DEPOT AND ANOTHER LOKI REFIT!

Yes, because making them useless for anything that isn't a dedicated droneboat is a good idea...
---
Looks like this will be the future of eve for kill capitals now.
---
" ....what year is it?"  
---
1776, of course.
---
PIRAT WARDECCED US YESTERDAY SO NONE OF MY BOYS CAN GET IN ON THE ACTION. FUCKIN' PISS M8.
---
I think it's pretty telling, that I've seen a video that had the victim's comms included, where as soon as the FC realized what was happening, the orders were essentially "Burn back to gate. We're probably all going to die."
---
Kys.
---
In game.
---
@teamcotty ))
---
Defending the clearly fail of CCP looks more  pathetic.
---
Eve's community isn't split across shards or private servers. WoW's community is already split, and has been so for a long-arse time. That's the key difference.
---
Maybe EVE should follow suit and rerelease 2004 EVE.
---
Nice dodge.  Pick a character.
---
lol good luck avoiding a fleet you can;t see coming cyno'd in by a ship you can't see till it decloaks, points you and lights the covert cyno.
---
#I SAID YOU USE TOO MUCH TOMATO YOU POT-LICKER!
---
if you need it fast buy  if you play the long game mine yourself (moon ore makes it faster to mine the basics  but its stil limited to the cycle time)
---
That’s another thing. YOU PEOPLE see fucking bots in every damn shadow. “Oh fuck no! I had that guy. Bullshit. I hella shot that pussy. Must be botting...” /respawn
---
I mean seriously. That’s the answer for everything it seems. I don’t dispute the fact that they exist and are used but, god damn. 
---
We got a pie graph that could be spun like the wheel of fortune. But I wanna see numbers, actual numbers. or noneyoufucks can say shit with any certainty.

I HELPED WITH THAT DAMN RESCUE AND DIDN'T GET A DAMN BIT OF RECOGNITION!  THAT PERSON WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SAVED WITHOUT ME!  I'M NOT JUST A DAMN CHEERLEADER, I DID MY PART DAMN IT! !
---
There are bots in tapi and goons. Those 2 groups just kick them when the are found.
---
but the all father Mitani said goons don't bot
---
Blobbers
---
Yeah!
---
then you get jank like being caught in an invisible bubble and shit
---
&gt; if your not in leadership your not building an empire your building somebody else his empire
---
Just like in real life then?
---
It is not about being the guy at the top commanding everyone to build an empire. Empire building is about being part of an empire, whatever part you play.
---
THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT CANT BE SOLVED WITH A LOKI REFIT:
---
ONLY THE SMALLEST SHIPS CAN ENTER THIS WORMHOLE
---
The numbers are going to be down and due to this a legion of screeching morons are going to take those numbers and declare to the heavens that CCP is killing the game, even though judging overall health of the game by MER is even more of a flawed metric than PCU.
---
Glad y’all are having fun.
---
China#1
---
Yea fuck TAPI for awoxing and then kicking the botters months before CCP does it!
---
That sounds horrible.
---
I remember playing a long time around with pyfa and evemon, one thing that set them appart is that there are not many shield skills, and all shields module are dead-space/w/e, almost all other modules can be meta'd too to avoid any unecessary level (this was to fly the rattle as soon as possible, it does add to the bling)
---
Nestors needed a V skill for the remote repairs, and they need two battleship skills.
---
I could be wrong, but I know I choose rattles because it was faster to train them on.
---
But I never did the calc for leshaks, and I think they might need same or less SP despite the remote repairs.. And everybody wants to fly some leshaks.
---
Did you eat your words? Two leshaks gets around 2100ehp/s, that's not enough for the big sites
---
Southern racing club is a botting corp that regularly launders botting isk via corp wallet. If you look at their members, you can see they've all got names like 'sghalsjfljasdf', and are all very young characters flying mostly Myrms and Praxis. 
---
That entire alliance is a sanctioned WinterCo botting alliance, doing so under direct support from their coalition. They used to live in Wicked Creek/Scalding Pass, if you want to go check the Q-NA5H constellation and their 5NQI mining bots. They've now moved to Cache, but you can easily see their bots in action, just swing by 2-2, U-Q, 0LY (which is now shared with Vindictive) etc.
---
&gt;I like to give CCP the benefit of the doubt that they try to avoid false positives 
---
I have one name for you that applies to why that's a crock o'shit, Brisc Rubal. CCP makes it up as they go along.
---
(⊙ˍ⊙)？
---
Yes, using intel and situational awareness. There have always been dumb and/or unlucky people in this respect but nothing has changed there.
---
Watch this man escape roaming gangs with FACTS and LOGIC!
---
Have fun!
---
Also, totally thought this was bait / copypasta when i started reading.
---
No, you just haven't had to face a blops fleet with even a token level of competence.
---
They literally told me that's what they were doing. And their actions (or rather: inaction) when things were being repped confirmed it.
---
You really should avoid pretending (or actually believing?) that you know everything about everybody. Very bad habit to get into.
---
It won't be all bad I remember when you could but a Plex subscription for about 300 mil a month.
---
Who still rats?
---
With the current silliness of week long timers and Ansiblex jump bridges, any major bloc who wants to come help kill a structure can get there with a fleet - with or without wormholes.
---
What this enables is easy raiding through wormholes. What it generates is unpredictability and new opportunities. This is a tool that isn't dependent on having lots of players to spend hours scanning down chains or having the Ansiblex jump bridge network to go from Delve to Tribute in minutes. This is one change that actually benefits little guys because the barrier to entry is so low.
---
If you're only doing industry buy it yourself.
---
There's a whole bunch of tiers of profit margin depending on how back in the production chain you start, but the tier of margin that comes when you mine all the materials yourself is not worth it in the long run.
---
If you do mining, you certainly can mine some of your inputs, but don't necessarily try to track down all of them in your rorq.
---
where da info on the new carrier/fighter nerfs?
---
i really dont like how this is possible
---
Ty based ibeast
---
Not really, because every single planet has a different quantity of minerals.
---
As a general rule of thumb (Provided that you're only using one char, you can do lots more with more chars) you really want to have your command center upgrades skill to III or IV.
---
If you get interplanetary consolidation to II, you can easily do all P2 harvesting and manufacturing. If you have it to IV, then you can do most of the P3 production such as Robotics.
---
If you're looking at the 3-tier P3 and P4 stuff, then you really need multiple chars running PI.
---
Dont forget, you can always do manufacturing only planets, you dont need very high levels of upgrades, and every planet is independent!
---
They should zoom in slowly every day.
---

Yes. If you had moused over that little arrow at the bottom of the bar it would have told you that it was a false positive

You'll have to indicate where the creepy guy in your screenshot, all I see in it is the face of God...

Do they drop anything or do you need to salvage them?
---
Minerbumping has therapeutic properties
---
22B in wallet and how much SP, how much assets?
---
So if you cant light a cyno 5 minutes before DT, how do you get the dps in to kill the cap jumping to a cyno at 5 minutes and 5 seconds before DT ???
---
Where do you do PI tho?
---
I like how it says eve pulse and he has that scary forced smile with his hands coming together as if hes about to happily squeeze the throat of something.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hes literally killing the game in his ads lmao
---
I've got a few ships in my hangars that would have been blobbed to death if not for a squad of light ECM drones.
---
Few things are more satisfying than engaging a reasonable solo/small group, getting tackled, seeing a blob appear on dscan, getting a jam off on the tackle, and moon-walking out as the blob lands.
---
Make tech 2 variants with way more ehp and slightly better speed and strength. Change the rig pently for sw drones, CPU is a really bad trade.
---
&gt;  Agency aka spoonfeeding feature for some really strange players.
---
outch
---
PL once was known as the richest and most dangerous.
---
Now you know if they engage on you its because you fucked up so bad they knew they cant lose.
---
How is it a good thing that DOZENS of drones in the game suck ass? Why not just delete them?
---
Just like login numbers youll soon see that the MER is at an ALL time high, it will, as a matter of fact be SO high that it will be touted as the reason for the next fun-obliterating *chaos changes*
---
Thank god carriers warp so fast that a nano gang cant get in system, scan him down, and land on the anom hes warping to before he even lands.

I mean, if that wasn't possible you'd be so horribly wrong that it might even be insulting.

Oh boy from nano kitey bs to dual mwd nano kitey

Yeah nobody comes to test space to kill krabs, don't give them ideas
---
Thanks for the note.
---
I mean on TIS Ryze is pretty clear that they wanted people to stop farming isk to turn off the three year isk faucet. I don't know why they wouldn't want to expose that since it was what they wanted to happen.

Who the heck do Eve and WoW even overlap at all, I never had and never will have any interest in that type of game, not saying thing about it, just don’t know how you can be like “Eve is dead, going to play WoW”.
---
The elite small-gang PvP overlords have decreed that ratting or mining in nullsec are no longer "valid" forms of gameplay.   Please trash any capital or supercapital ships you ratted with and proceed to "git gud" and/or learn to get by on what you can loot from good, fair-fight small-gang fights.
---
They were trying ti balance isk and mineral faucets, it sounds like they’ve achieved their goals, based on Rise’s comments on talking in stations
---
Most still play eve, but theres a significant amount of eve players thatll be playing classic and id like to try to get them all on the same realm. This isnt an eve is dead post
---
You got some pretty good kills! Killing a comet is a feat. Funny that you got the two kills at the end, they clearly didn't know what they were doing.
---
The used TD on you, reducing your optimal range probably and that's why you weren't hitting them at all
---
But where is the interest overlap, would think you would be going to another space game.
---
Tama/Kedama?
---
I suggest looking at zkill!
---
What am I missing here? A rorq pulls 4 bill in 9 hours? I dont thi m that's accurate.
---
Why would anyone want to star in their own rabbit hunting adventure when you could be a pawn in someone else's game?
---
Clearly you have never met him.  
---
Falcon is the shit.
---
I used to super rat while watching movies it just almost became a reflex
---
Not just no, but HELL NO!
---
I have done it, I used to super rat when I was in Init and I just sold my nyx cause it got old and I found better isk sources.
---
It became a reflex to the point I could watch movies pretty easily. I wasn't getting straight 300mil/hr but it was around 270-280 generally.
---
Though what do I know as someone with a few hundred hours doing it.
---
You can kite!
---
No.
---
Since you can multibox in eve, you can do a lot of stuff alone.
---
Id wager a huge number of eve players have played or came from wow, and wow classic is gonna be baller

I found using hotkeys helps a lot for this. I have my highs bound to 1-5, and shift-1 overheats that module for example. Q-E keys for mids and A-D for lows is how I do it
---
null, low or wh depending on where you have toons.
---
I heard that Hilmar, Falcon and a couple people of their choosing were made a very lucrative offer by PA for the creation of a brand new MMO, but not while EvE still needed their attention.
---
Retail WoW is shit because it caters to bad players.  
---
Vanilla WoW was decent because it was more difficult.   
---
EvE players like difficult games, not just space games.  
---
Hopefully Classic is more like Vanilla than Retail. 
---
But I have my doubts, there isn't even proper AV apparently.
---
Opportunity cost!!! You don't save isk by mining for yourself. You probably lose isk, because in the time you're mining you could have made more isk doing something else in game and bought the materials. (This is definitely true for any newbie and probably true for anyone who isn't multiboxing a fleet of miners on their own.)
---
Looks like false positive.
---
Just from my gaming circles, a lot of people started off with either everquest or WoW as their first 3d mmorpg and learned about eve when researching more mmo games. This was the case for me personally, I joined wow one hear after its launch and learned about eve in 2008.
---
Think that’d be something to PM the mods about
---
Monochrome dashboard icons :dagger:
---
To fight those, you have to be smart and setup a bait, or you can be good (with good skills&amp;ship too) and kite them. Some people seem to farm kiki's flown by bad players. It's a fragile ship with great dps.
---
Really helpful to have some friends in those situations.
---
FW is a great introduction, buy and fit 20 T1 frigates and undock whenever you want.
---
As someone that came from WoW, it has a lot of similarities. MMO is the main one of course, communities, guilds, groups runs, helping noobs get started, patch cycles to change mechanics, etc. I'm sure the crossover is pretty real. Also why would I want to play two space games at once? I tend to play a lot of games, one or two of each type. I am playing Eve, Escape from Tarkov, Apex, and WoW on the regular.
---
If eve was a game you can grind to max level in a month or two then sure

EVE classic is how a lot of people came to MMOs I think. I still feel nostalgic about my early days in WOW. Also classic WOW had really fun world PVP. I don't have the time to play WOW these days but I kinda wish I did.

 Doesn't he look something like the guy from the history channel that says "aliens"?
---
Look out for probes on D-scan and warp to a citadel (while already being pre-aligned when ratting)? Also, cyno can't help your carrier if a blops gang manages to tackle you, you'll be dead in seconds.

It's still possible to end up working on fucked up grids. Once, I was involved in an anchoring Faction Fort fight where the gridline was roughly 300km away from the Fortizar Perimeter on 3 sides, which allowed for some really weird off-grid dynamics when ships would ping off, and the opposing fleet would have difficulty tracking them or bubbling themm. Another memorable time was when I was flying in a fleet of HACs against a larger force, and the gridline ended up being roughly 200km away from the gate. As we burned away, in line to the next gate, trying to force a range advantage, the enemy fleet burned after us, and stopped before the grid boundary, as it would split up their forward tackle from the trailing DPS fleet and support ships.
---

---
just realized that my brain has just been ignoring his left hand since i first saw it
---
It's actually productive though (to an extent). Teaches people about the mechanics of the game through baptism by fire. It's better to learn it right now and lose your shitfit 20M covetor, than through something far more embarassing once you accidentally stroll into low or null sec in a loot pinata financed by decades of ignorant hisec activities.
---
&gt; just like their normal TP brethren
---
target painters are stacking penalized.
---
Don't be an idiot, slots are already in very short supply on blops. What are you gonna drop for it, tank, mjd, cap booster, or tackle? Pick one. You could use a sig amp, but you already barely out dps a bomber, you definitely don't wanna lose your damage mods.
---
Tackle and you just rely on the entire fleet you can teleport with you to tackle them?
---
This is good info but what I'm looking for in a site would be this:
---
Your system has these plants.
---
You could make this or this or this
---
Nothing special but just the options and possibilities.
---
I just imagine someone from /r/all reading this and wondering what these words mean and why “disco party” is being used as a verb.
---
Sometimes but I'm finding the salvage being the most valuable.
---
yes
---
That's because they already lost the fight.
---
The fight with pipebombing is all about positioning and timing.
---
It's not about what happens when the fleets see each other.

Sell your rorq for a good DED/escalation ship. Rorqs are for people who multibox a dozen and can run them all day, as an individual it will take almost 60 hours for a single rorq to pay for itself. They are a terrible investment. They're incredibly strong combat ships tho, way more effective than haw dreads against subcaps.
---
No, that's Londo Mollari.
---
Skill Urself disagrees.
---
Just remember, just because you mined it doesn't mean it’s free.  You save money by cutting out the middle man, the minerals you mine still have value (they could be sold for ISK directly).
---
They are holding on to it cause they are embarrassed to show the horrendous number for July! lol
---
Reading the other pasts about this exact thing is hard
---
I feel like, just like most of these kinds of things, WoW classic will happen and people will be filled with nostalgia and then after a few weeks realize that WoW now is a lot better than it was then.

Slowpoke.

What did you move to Korea for?
---
I moved here 2 years ago.
---
Rat in a dead end system with a gatecamp to frag recons
---
Because there isn't anything there.
---
That's not how it works at all.
---
This is no transits
---
사랑 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 
---
My wife is Korean and we moved from the US for her work (researcher). I left my job in the US (was a homicide detective) and am currently spending the first couple months here crunching Korean language studies. I sold my battle station before moving and just have my old MSI GT 72 with 970M laptop... no comparison to 1440p ultrawide IPS gaming.. Very sad days. I'll go all out on a new gaming rig around the end of the year though lol
---
It's so nice to see that someone just begun their path on eve online. Especially when u have friends to explore this game together. Game is not that exciting when u have tons of SP and billions on the wallet.. Good luck, fly safe o7
---
Those can say failed but still increase your accuracy rating.
---
The failed means it wasn't perfect, but your rating is based on how good it is.
---
Getting in random fights while leveling was fun as hell
---
This post is wholesome as fuck.
---
Glad you're enjoying the game, friend!
---
tbf wealth isn't a factor anymore.
---
Alright, it's quite obvious you've never used a blops before.
---
You see many blops on killmails with bomber fleets? How bout with t3c fleets? That's because whatever you're dropping on will be long dead by the time your bridge is down and you can jump, and if it isn't you probably don't want to jump your 2bil free killmail onto it's head because of how much you have to gimp your fit to stick a bridge on.
---
Not all dogs
---
 You get partial credit for those.
---
Really like this podcast, really like that it isn't null bloc focussed bullshit  already learned a tonne.
---
they are better for corps/alliances yes. but please, PLEASE let me share a hangar with all my chars just like i could with poses. the constant contracting of ships between toons is a fucking pain.
---
completely ignoring the annoying ''hey get fucked, all your mods are now offline'' you sometimes get when contracting stuff
---
Where is parameter
---
 Because that was a test case that had no transits and you marked one.  
---
The higher your accuracy the more reward you get.   At 99% accuracy you get 99k a slide.
---
Isn't there a WoW Classic subreddit?
---
No, it was the GM's typing.
---
The actual players were banned months ago.
---
That is because you are dumb.
---
Hello. Punctuation and capital letters are a thing.
---
Putting aside my personal thoughts of the Chaos bullshit (I hate it)....I have met Paul (CCP Falcon) several times in real life. He is a really cool guy, normal dude, just like most of us...I say "most of us" loosely :) But seriously, Paul in real life should not be shunned because he has his picture on the launcher.
---
CCP MAKE HIGHSEC MORE POORER. 00 IS DAMN EMPTY
---
&gt; what stopped alliances from anchoring poses at every moon to shut down offensive poses against them? 
---
Nothing.  We did it.
---
Did you know that most systems have a shitload of moons?  Structure spam was just as bad, you just couldn't see them on the overview until you got close.
---
“I’m not saying it was Triglavians....but it was Triglavians”

I don't mind that they're not very strong, but they're so unbelievably slow they're nigh on unusable. What's the point of light web drones that can't even keep up with a typical nano cruiser?
---
FC, WHAT IS A NOVICE, SMALL AND MEDIUM PLEX?!?!?!
---
Yes, but it doesnt have eve players i am looking to play with

I didn’t think of MMO being a genre into itself, I have a strong affinity towards space/sci-fi games.

I don't know about her Corp, but I don't think she plays anymore based off her Twitter feed.
---
If they post it and it shows tanking numbers in everything across the board they would have to admit their "changes" were too much and Hilmar, and his brown nose champion falcon just couldn't handle, that thus the delayed release.
---
Whilst I doubt that's relevant after he was there for a year, I was just correcting rolocks statement that he wasn't a goon

Its not as easy as people think to find ways to turn a platter full of turds into gold plated success.
---
based on Rise's comments they went 9-10 steps to far and now need to dial it back.
---
Blame CCP not PL. The game got to a point where all those newbros joining those massive blue donuts are now in capitals.
---
Allegedly, God is always watching and knows what you're doing.
---
That's pretty creepy if you ask me.
---
I seem to not be able to buy expensive stuff from jita without getting insta shot by I'm assuming someone's alt.

Any suggestions? I'm assuming I'm doing something wrong otherwise jita wouldn't be the Central market but not sure. Last lost was a fully tanked mammoth right after I undocked.

Going to be rolling horde on herod.

&gt; How the heck do Eve and WoW even overlap at all
---
most people probably ended up in eve after being bored of WoW. i know i did.
---
unfortunatey, replaying the same wow content i got bored of that brought me here isn't really high up on my priorities.
---
How does one know about this in advance? Seems like a great opportunity to whore on kills!
---
That's a Durka Fleet iirc
---
&gt;  there isn't even proper AV apparently.
---
oh man if you thought DT to DT tidi was bad...
---
4 day long AV matches... fuck me...
---
Once they're called out. Nevermind the entire regions of our space used for botting
---
how is that any different than eve?  click click click click f1 f2 f3  more clicking a few more button pushes rinse repeat
---
So it's ccp's fault that "newbros" have big ships....
---
Which means pl cant use...their big ships why?  
---
That has EVERYTHING to do with PL's killboard fear.  Imagine if wealth truly didnt matter AND killboards didnt matter, we'd have 100+ man dreadfights in delve daily.
---
This ^^
---
Buying all the ore &amp; tossing a titan in build in a 1.5 days is way more efficient than trying to mine it up yourself from a producer's standpoint.

it is a change of pace for people, you can enjoy both.

You have clearly not thought this through.

Your idea is bad and you should feel bad.
---
It still shows a delayed (30 minutes) number of pilots in space on the map.
---
Correct.
---
We LOVE the blackout.
---
Like the Nestor the rattle needs 2 battleship skills as well. Also you only need remote armor repair to 4 to use tech 2 remotes, same with the large remote capacitor transmitter.

Can’t do faction warfare as a goon

As opposed to zering each other and pushing F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1F1?

**Ą**
---
that happened in perimeter, clearly not parameter
---
not to mention classic wow has been a thing for years after all the private servers fixed all the code blizzard swoops in and rakes in all the cash.
---
I leveled a warlock and a pally about a year ago on a server with thousands of players everything working at 100% even raids.
---
It works if you drag the desired skill to the skill queue and confirm the purchase there. Not a fix, a work around without resetting everything

[Much better view](https://imgur.com/D4nvwll) of the man. He has something of [a commanding presence](https://imgur.com/LSqxPlg).

I cannot support OP in his request to remove this glorious man from the launcher. Seeing him there tells me I’m coming home.

Show me where I defended CCP. I'm just saying it's pathetic to insist that the game die.
---
what
---
PL getting counterdropped by everybody and their mom will take a toll.
---
Look at Delve. They can pump out ships/isk like there's no tomorrow. Being a "nomadic hotdropper" isn't something that's viable in today's game. Add on the jump fatigue and you'll never see anything like old PL
---
(Not saying jump fatigue is good/bad, just that it's a thing)
---
blitzing covert sites? how do you blitz them? dont you just wipe the battleships?
---
Oof. Plastic Wraps. What was the real value of the KM?
---
https://youtu.be/Wr0FljlIGhc?t=5
---
&gt; how did the guy do garrison+drifter in 30 mins
---
Look at the Windows clock in the bottom left corner for the actual time. He initiates warp at 16:58, and the drifter pops at 18:13.
---
I found that video fucking phenomenal! Wow!

ur dumb lol

Throwing out the baby with the bath water is not good design. Period.

Just make citadels better.

I know it isnt "elite" but ffs if you have 100 people mining for a month you can shit out more dreads than you can believe

Someone thought moving a freighter full of Spodumain would be a good idea with Goons around.
---
No local, one system. Everybody parachutes/warps into system with their choice of any T1 Frig! Different modules scattered throughout the system that players must scoop and fit after they get their Depot down. 
---
Drifter clouds... periodically constrict until the remaining pilots are less the 100km from the sun. From there all remaining pilots must bushido brawl until finally Hilmar warps in to mop up the field.
---
Yes, it's bad. Noticed today.

Do you only play EVE? I like and play all kinds of games. There doesn't need to be overlap between games I enjoy.

What are the skill requirements to anchor a raitaru/astrahus/athanor?
---
Communcations Officer:  
---
Can add, edit, and delete corporation bulletins shown in the corporation window; can create &amp; edit Corp and Alliance events in the calendar; can edit/delete corp bookmarks (People &amp; Places) created by others; and can edit the Corp channel MotD. 
---
I am still hoping for a corp/alliance rework which splits these roles and allows to set a default role for members. In most cases, it doesn't hurt if anyone can create events (it even would make it easier for everyone to inform people of content they are trying to create for the group) or edit/delete corp bookmarks (most of the time this is needed to clear out the last 50 bookmarks of whs and singnatures in system that no longer exist and the persons who created them don't seem to care about removing them), maybe bookmarks will no longer be a problem with the access list changes, whenever that happens.
---
Bulletins/Corp MotD should be a seperate role.
---
how much you make an hour? it might not
---
Fighter support unit. You will get caught and die eventually, might as well try and make the most of it.
---
why aeschee? does it have less possible mission locations?
---
thats how you do it, yes, and there are many ways to do it
---
That depends entirely on how good your other money making methods are and how good your mining is. If you can make 100 mil per hour ratting or something else but only mine 50 mil worth of minerals per hour, one hour of ratting will allow you to buy two hours worth of mining. If you can't do anything better than 50 mil/hr, mining is your best bet.
---
 But that has nothing to do with industry, that's just common sense. Doing the thing that earns you the most money will be the best for you in all cases because you can use that money to buy anything you need. The only time it is worth it to mine is when mining is your best money maker.
---
They beta’d about the same time. I played both in the early 2000s, WOW was just dev’d into oblivion first.
---
For rewards, you mean the isk reward? The isk you earn from PD is taxed by your corporation, just like all other bounties.
---
You can’t solo filaments?

Inconvenience is not difficulty

ECM drones are just fine. The rest have not been relevant....ever... please stop asking for 4th level shit when we are still working on 1st level.
---
The isk-rewards yes.  
---
The site says it should be 10k is per accuracy, that would mean a payout of 600k åt 60% but I got something like 30k instead.
---
That only furthers my point. You were earning way too much with far to little risk. 
---
I really shouldn’t have to argue my experience to establish credibility. The whole things a bit subjective. But, my Corp has 10 members. Together we have 27,000 kills and 3,600 loses. And I hold my own in the ranks. 
---
I just don’t need 5 bill laying around to replace the Rorqual that I’m never going to lose.
---
Great video, fun to see DarkSide shredding shit lately
---
except these guys were all banned months ago. this was just a way for ccp to try to artificially keep the market afloat a little longer by reintroducing faction mods that were locked by banned bots. and get some good pr doing it.
---
"at the end of trial"? What year rn? Anyway good luck and fly safe o7
---
you ask this of the guys who gave us jump fatique? YOU ASK TOO MUCH.

No it wasnt
---
Seriously fuck that face its scary....
---
I think they are waiting for truckloads of morons to post their conspiracy threads and comments.
---
I meant you need one level of gallente for the rattlesnake, and 3-4 Caldari. For the nestor, the drone damage is one of the two battleship skill, and the other is for the armor. So being low level on any of these is a big hit on dps or tank. The rattle's drone damage bonus is full as long as you can fly it

---
* they have really strong ewar

Cons :          
---
* They are immobile so you can move out of range or kill them easier

Thanks for subtitles, awesome!

When an enemy hurt you, you become emotionally charged and react to the perceived threat. You become restless and judgmentally weak. Your ego will start hammering on you to act against the enemy so that you stand proudly before yourself.
---
In particular, occasion, your enemies may arise even from your closet friends or relatives. Usually, such enemies are more dangerous than open enemies. You can make your strategies to overcome them.

CCP is giving free capital kills to higsec newbies.           
---
Those are banned accounts/assets.
---
and with this i dont understand what this engine is even getting to. 
---
2 tests and all theyve achieved is getting 3.5k people to connect, the rest having issues. both times. and given a PC away to one of them. If this were to help eve, or even work with eve in the future it would have to be tested with the struggles a large eve fight produces now.
---
Stock the SMB full of cyno fit recons, eject one, ghost ride carrier, light cyno? No idea if that’s possible or practical though
---
you cant actually say your an eve fan unless you have watched the Youtube series of 'Clarion Call' episode 1, 2, 3 and 4 (i think theres even a 5) 4 from memory was the one that gave me goosebumps the first 3 times i watched it
---
presumably it owuld be to fly heavy tanked sihps, and cyno the big guns in to remove the smartbomb issue

I assume he's talking about May(?) capital nerf.

---
во!
---
BBUTBUTBUTBUTBUBUTBUTUTBBUT there were other rotations like rogues sinister strike/backstab and eviscerate!
---
dicky needls
---
I find that if it has a HS static then there is more traffic. But as this is a daytrip then i follow this:  
---
Fly what you can afford. Or rather, Dont fly what you cant afford. Fly dirt cheap, lose little. I find a 155m battlecruiser can run c3's without difficulty, and a cheaper battlecruiser can run c2's relatively easily.  
---
otherwise i would say that C1's have less PVP just because i have never been attacked in a c1. or a c2. always C3's. (mostly its more popular).
---
There is no reward without risk.
---
So are kindness, respect and politeness.
---
The higher the class of wormhole the more scarce known space connections are, so you will come across fewer people than if you stuck to the c1-3 wormholes
---
Been there. Felt pretty lonely all the time. The only fun was when our Corp was roaming nullsec or crabbing in C5 static. Or when my gila got killed. 
---
It was the most boring time of all my time in the game.
---
The class itself wouldn’t make it more dangerous. If anything, you’ll actually see many more people in lower class holes due to the kspace static’s making it easily accessible to pilots.
---
This is a really difficult question to answer. Are you after a fight? If so use a mapping tool and save entities that you know will fight, if you want to avoid fights, avoid those mapped systems. 
---
Generally larger groups will want to fight and reside in c5 space, with the exception of some C2 groups who will also fight. Noone in C4 besides WHSOC will engage as they too busy bearing static. C3s and c1s are dead but generally have a highsec nearby so opportunities to camp reside here. If you find someone here they are probably worth trying to bait. C6 space is pretty much bear space owned by a handful of groups. 
---
Hope this helps. Use the tools available such as pathfinder, siggy and vippy.
---
If you can fly a battlecruiser C1's, C2's, and sometimes c3's can be done. So battlecruiser skills and some basic gun and shield skills should do it.  
---
I dont know about optimal fits but my personal favorite is oddly a shield tanked myrmidon, 155m and can take on c3's without a problem.
---
Is what it is. Opportunity for free cash here aswell. It’s a shame they don’t accept the game.
---
You can go in a wormhole from day one providing you have scanning skills. Whether you will be able to kill anything is another question. People have been successful even in herons and T1 cruisers.
---
I guess I’m not an eve fan lol. I watch a bunch of the current news but nothing from the time before I joined eve. That video did a great job explains everything and talking through their strategy. Awesome stuff.
---
Depends what you’re doing. Bare minimum skills to fly a venture with gas harvesters or a scanning frigate (heron etc.) for hunting relic or data sites works. The relic and data sites will prove challenging but the with practice I think you may be able to get a few ( maybe, just take note that there are WH specific relic/data sites and K-Space sites. The WH sites will have rats)
---
Short answer: That's not a significant factor.
---
For day-tripping, the most important thing is where the existing connections go to. If you enter from highsec close to Jita, for example, the chances of being attacked are *very very high*. If you enter from lowsec in the middle of nowhere and there aren't other wormhole connections, you will probably only be found if someone rolls into the hole. C1s are rolled less than the other classes, and I don't know how the stats compare beyond that, but I would bet the profit margins outweigh the added risk. If you and your friends can run C3s, do that. If you can run C5s, do those instead.
---
Play Ashes of Creation?
---
[sorry am bit poor](https://i.imgur.com/tYkuHtd.jpg)
---
This! Speaking from a personal viewpoint I probably wouldn't lated as long in eve if my second corp, when I was a fresh newbie,wasn't just like described here. WE had 15 people on at most and it was very fun, and very tight knit, best times.
---
c1 would be lower chance just due to mass restrictions.
---
But otherwise, not really.
---
Most people explore the chain, not simply ignore low class holes.
---
For targets and potential k-space out points that might be useful.
---
What you really need is the scanning skills at least to the alpha max levels and a half decent combat ship (unless you're hacking).
---
I actually hate highsec. So for me this is one way of getting my assets safe and forget about the game for the next few years.
---
this was me telling you : watch bloody clarion call 1-5 (4 especially) they dont nessesarily have to be in order.
---
i think youll enjoy 4. most nerds do (like me)
---
Pretty sure some did, the supers had a small delay before turning suspects and i saw lots of people going flashy red during that delay.

Lost a Tengu to a 'Pleasure Gardens' exploding on a mission...
---
This has been happening for me too and i’m not sure why.  Been playing with settings but can’t figure it out 
---
went from able to run 10 clients smoothly to ABSOLUTELY choking on 4
---
I've had this after updating to the 64bit client, I've found that turning off 'Asteroid environments', 'Trails', 'Drone models' and 'Light rays' helped whilst not really effecting the look of the game. play around with these and see if it helps.
---
(I also have an overclocked i5)
---
We're in high-sec, but far away from Jita in a relatively low populated area. But thank you for that info.
---
Thank you for the info! We're not after a fight. Just wanna do the sites and get out.
---
I know this is a REALLY hard concept to grasp
---
But there’s space they own they can farm
---
And all space has ore
---
And if one side can do it, so can the others.  
---
Complaining is fun but this is ludicrous
---
Sorry to offend love, go back to your small roams
---
Thanks for your reply! Of course, I am aware of the risks. But the more I know what risks are present the better I can make decisions.
---
I would call it very few people in apex armor brawl ships.
---
You might want to choose a different option because that fleet is just feed bait for actual apex armor brawl WH corps.
---
It's the newest copy pasta now
---
Use an Insta-Undock bookmark; use a DST or a BR, don't carry more than 3000 ISK/1000 EHP in your cargo.
---
Bit harsh.
---
Ah damn seems I missed everything when I decided to not log in today. Do they announce these special kills on the forums or something?
---
C3 might be a good test bed for you then. Very few people live in C3 compared to 2 and the sites are easily run in T1 BC.
---
Some great points here. I really like the idea of making drones only engageable by other drones. I’ve always thought that should be to hard to track for anything other than small weapons. This would possibly open up drone combos to deter and destroy other drones??
---
that my friend, is known as a HAW dread.
---
same price a t3 battleship would be, maybe a little more damage then one would have for say, i guess dreads a hella lot more easier to make than a t3 battleship would be. i guess no one would use them unless frigate scan res lol
---
I had fun :) The most I've had in a long time playing this game. That's the only thing that matters to me.
---
Clonne tags won't help to get above 0. Just kill a BS rat every 15 min or so.
---
game devs that actually have a plan.
---
IT WAS FOR MAXIMIZING HITS AGAINST TARGETS I SWEAR
---
no luck， just math。
---
\*to 1   
---
FTFY
---
you should really stop outright believing what people tell you and do some larger scale thinking. Especially in eve and to some extent in RL too.
---
Well the guy is still on your discord and authed, just that alt was removed.
---
It wasnt that many Rokhs
---
Ccp trying to nerf multiboxing stealthily, i'd wear that tinfoil
---
Thank you for killing me! I was the tit in the rattle that should never have been undocked!
---
Happy hunting!
---
loving the pictures, i know your having fun, but to be a nerd, try to name them following the genre of names on each faction, (bird names or religious connected names (the oblivion kind of kept this)
---
they also do have to stay on the same sort of design shapes (not just the colours imo) wonderful work to see though.
---
I've got the same problem, wondering why..
---
Even at 99% accuracy you never earn more than 99k isk. 
---
I have PD to level 500.
---
I think there was a lot of potential in the POS mechanics, if they got around to fixing/replacing that code and upgrading the UX/interface a bit (to make setup less tedious - maybe something like the PI interface, but in 3d idk).  I think I've also made a post about it somewhere in here.   
---
Imo the citadels where a cheap sidestepping the POS code while it's being removed but it feels just like that - cheap.   
---
It can still be fixed, e.g. - anchoring services outside the citadels, reducing timers in k-space at least, have the asset safety part be a service module as well (interbus office idk), just a few ideas (not entirely thought through tbh, but i'm not being paid to think about them :) )
---
whenever i open the character selection page, my CPU load goes up. its not as bad anymore but still massivly over the amount it used to be on 32bit, do you have your character sheets open on other pages?
---
I mean the nyxs main is still in test and authed, let's not kid yourselves that Test actually put in effort to removing botters.
---
https://evewho.com/pilot/Barbaros+Haynes
---
Yup I've noticed tons of NS&lt;-&gt;LS holes now too, where it was significantly less about a week ago.
---
WTB Dual static C5s/6s
---
&gt;Titan. Alts. Production.
---
Why can't you work towards those in subcaps?
---
You're the reason kiki guns are fucking expensive :(
---
Amazing fight dude! I like how you guys do these 1 pilot/ship ops.   
---
no combat scanners/t3s dropping on you I am a bit disappointed in your opponents, though. They got what's coming for them.
---
Oh, wow.
---
Hahahaha hey Zen!
---
Whose complaining, I don't get it, you are trying to start an argument when no one else was?
---
as an active prober, i only wish i could say the same... i cant notice any difference at all. there were always times in which you get tons of connections and times where your chains just looks terrible..
---
so maybe its just luck?
---
Thats good, i'mglad you had fun. But please don't fall into the misconception that a lot of WH groups do. IE trying to fly the same ships and do the same fleets that HK or lazers would do for example.
---
I've seen a lot of corps try to go this route only to find out later that they aren't HK or lazers. Its better to find something that suits your group and use it to have fun.
---
How would you fit your stratios for this kind of expedition?
---
I think this one is a bit of a lost cause... my point stands.
---
They don’t want to farm, they fell from grace because of that
---
It’s a fixable issue but they are historically renowned edgelords when it comes to pvp and i don’t care if you agree or not that’s just fact.  It’s why they aren’t seen asa serious threat and never will again until they decide they want to be on top and try again
---
Goons can f1 on rocks just as simply as any other alliance, in any space, any region.
---
How do people know about these events?
---
Because the faucet was already falling towards the floor. What happens if say, July mining and ratting is higher than June?
---
We brought exactly what we needed to win vs. their comp, and we won.
---
I know at least one C4 where you will get the action you want (ofc if by small fleet you don't mean some "high class" 15 man triglavian blob).
---
so would you bring that fleet against say a 60 man TDSIN fleet?
---
I feel like you really don't understand what you are talking about, and you heard someone say something once and have just ran with it.
---
Same bro.
---
Same
---
bro 😎💪
---
There's a few skins I found that are one time use now. As in you lose your ship you lose the skin. I hope that's not what I think it is. CCP are being awfully experimental now aren't they. I'm sure Pearl Abyss has nothing to do with it.
---
So you're playing from an internet cafe or something? Since you mentioned pay per hour. - if that's teh case get your 2 factor authentication if you can. I-cafes are known for being very unsafe with credentials.   
---
It's a very good occasion to become a community leader for your country and maybe even get a specific corp going - 5-10 core people can do a lot of things in eve.   
---
Also PLEX prices are dropping so if you have time to rat, you might be getting your omega easier in the next months.   
---
Fly safe o7
---
In eve you lunch your VNI's drone and you afk, in wow classic you right click the mob and afk auto attack
---
Die is used broadly. Accurate or not. Not everybody means it so literally. You can see it as Eve getting closer to that end of the spectrum in which case I think it is.
---
How do you think we would gave fared versus say, a group like sleeper dreams
---
Not sure who in their right mind would choose those two.
---
I swear this attitude comes from people who haven't actually played modern WoW seriously. They walk into the raids on sightseeing difficulty and think that's "too easy", but they never actually try the harder ones.
---
Modern WoW's mythic raid bosses are so much more complex/harder than anything vanilla had. 
---
The only "difficult" thing about vanilla was the boring grind you had to do to get anywhere. That's not difficulty, that's annoying.
---
Thought that's what they wanted though. Am confused.
---
sleeper cache?
---
Pretty good since I don't think those guys have existed in like 5 years.
---
I for one blame Vily, I’m sure it’s somehow his fault
---
Run relics in Serpentis or Sansha space... and be enjoy making as much as a Super Carrier in an Astero...
---
Are you trying to really trying to gatekeep a fleet comp by highlighting that their 12 man fleet would struggle against a 60 man TDSIN fleet? Kinda apples to oranges isn't it?
---
Time to have a look at those new AMD desktop chips. Pretty cheap for lots of cores and threads. You should even be able to flog your intel scrap to someoneone I'm sure.
---
They messed with some drifter agro mechanics to
---
Hmmm our probers are all reporting the same although the holes with minimal wormholes do look like krab holes and so I imagine krabs are rolling them all. Holes with loads of sites also seem to have lots of wormholes, I will print screen a chain later and continue monitoring !
---
Fed Intel Lv 5 agent, the two other systems you end up in are next door, you need to know which missions to decline and a guide to run the missions you accept, which easily found with Google.
---
remove all ewar drones as they are - put in a 25mb sentry version for each - it would act like a mission tower does.   
---
Drone ships would have the advantage of using more of them, ships with 25mb bandwidth will have the opportunity to use one to help with some effects. Make the effects stronger and the drones stats better.
---
&gt; Pretty good since I don't think those guys have existed in like 5 years. 
---
5 years eh. Interesting.
---
sorry man, I just saw this after I posted my thing which is about the same. This seems like a great idea, as long as you remove the smaller drones and buff the stats of these (think pve towers-like stats, or deployables)
---
you could kill a 60 man TDSIN Fleet with 3 people actually, But not trying to fly the same ships they are flying. Thats what I'm trying to tell him. Don't do what everyone else does or you will be very sad if your not a 500 person corps.
---
Why would you fly the same ships as they do when they can simply outnumber you.
---
But why is that even relevant? Isn’t that just a given?
---
You’re basically just very obnoxiously saying “If you are better than your opponent, you can win, regardless of numbers”
---
if they have they have been invisible since 2017 at the very least.
---
I'd suggest checking out /r/evejobs.
---
Our startup alliance, Total Eclipse., is starting a newbro-friendly Corp called Lunar Legion. It has all the normal stuff like free skillbooks, free ships for PvP/ratting/mining/exploration, and we're based in nullsec (Providence).
---
Shoot me a DM if you're interested in getting in on ground zero. The funding is there but we definitely dont have a blob.
---
Yea I don’t launch my drones and go afk, everything I do requires more effort than that.
---
It's only possible because low sec is so dead and nobody else does it.
---
&gt; if they have they have been invisible since 2017 at the very least. 
---
2017? Do you even play this game lmao
---
You know you could have just looked up the right answer on zkill right
---
Hola; what system are you in so I can kill your noctis with a bomber?
---
I dare you to carrier rat...  I FUCKING DARE YOU!
---
Don't be dumb, I'm saying dont copy a big corp doctrine, fly a big corp doctrine and think you are going to be successful with it. I'm saying do your own thing, think different. because ive seen lots of corps get discouraged and close up shop because thier top apex fleet keeps getting welped off the field; People get discouraged and stop logging in and boom dead corp.
---
Since there were only 2 super fleets in the game that would have been doing anything at all in provi when pos are relevant, and neither would be structure shooting for the fun of it, it's safe to say you got baited, although I can see how easily be. The actual reason was your FCs were refusing to provide fights and therefore your structures were touched as punishment.
---
having a bunch or ratting killed 2 months ago is not what I would call "active"
---
Ah good, you looked it up on zkill finally
---
Right, I get what you’re TRYING to do, but fail to see the relevancy in a thread of a video of a pretty equally fielded armor fleet. 
---
PS: I’m sure they appreciate your concern for their corporate longevity.
---
[removed]
---
Ha yeah... I guess they weren't support to just sentry rat heavens automaticly... or skynet fighter to interceptors (pls bring this back)... they sure as hell are out of control NOW
---
I my mind everyone should fly an orthrus...  or triglavian deadspace fit ship...
---
Sleeper dreams disbanded after ccp d e l e t e l o c a l
---
If you absolutely do not want to run into PVP then run C4 sites. 
---
The only people you will meet there have degenerated to such an extent that they are physically incapable of reshipping from their probing ship into a PVP one.
---
And even then chances are that wormhole number 12 in their chain will have collapsed by the time they get to you.
---
Easily Run in a T1 BC?????? How, what fit do u run them with, I cant even do them in a Praxis (150mil) due to tank issues
---
holy christ that cramitchurchy guy is an asshole in this thread. anyway, nice video looks like ya'll had fun!
---
What Fit? I find that shield Myrms dont have enough tank to facetank the c3s. I cant even do them in a Praxis that costs 150mil
---
How can u run c3s in a BC? what is this magical fit?
---
they did announce a new east coast pvp realm last night but i'm not sure if they will add more
---
are you planning on stalagg?

welp I tried :shrug:

playing eve 5 years in same machine with same setting after this june i getting fps drops after 30-60min of gameplay
---
He’s trying to save us from ourselves vOv
---
Cheers! We did &lt;3 a LOT of fun
---
The comma was the way. squizz wrote here on reddit that he removed that feature because it put too much load on the server. I can't find the post right now though. You can access his whole database through API though and could create those request yourself locally.
---
Also for your case you seem to want kills by the Class: Invading Precursor Entities. So you can just check https://zkillboard.com/group/4028/
---
Do you even play EVE? Have you ever been in a capital engagement?...
---
My internal conflict to decide if I should keep playing this shit game.
---
Just creating content is awesome. My Corp flies a similar doctrine. Just because a shit ton of people fly Leshaks doesn’t mean we are going to stop using them. Just because the Sabre is really strong doesn’t mean we are going to stop using them. 
---
Love the content though. Hope to get to brawl with/against you all some time.
---
Tbh if i was dropping somone and they did that id just steal the carrier.
---
I hope you didn't spend too much time on this. You'll never get it back.
---
No, I took what he said to mean not dial back the risk, but potentially dial up the ISK.
---
Hm interesting. I havent noticed anything and I live in a wormhole and scout out our chain everyday...
---
Maybe CCP have incorporated a distributed bit coin mining module to the eve client 🤔 &lt; /tinfoil&gt;
---
He talked about a group of people.
---
oHH lol. I thought u could facetank 1000dps in a BC Solo LOL
---
Really Good vid, Allways good to see some small scale armour brawls in W-space
---
First of all, I don't think any of us actually know exactly what has to be changed when CCP changes something.  It could be a couple lines of code.  It could be a database entry.  Or it could be fairly involved depending on the level of change they decided to go with.
---
That's not really the point though, either way.  Any change CCP does requires attention in the form of balancing, testing, and consideration of other ramifications because the game is so interlinked.  And in the midst of all the other stuff going on, it's that part of their attention that should really be focused on the bigger issues.
---
I checked and tbh in a constellation i found like 7 WH to C6 - need to scan more, but didn't see so many connections in a single area to C6 space so far.
---
tbh the green sites are like 800dps mitigated by sig for bs missiles so a passive tank drake could tank it, so would a properly tanked gila.
---
In any case, the toilet visit afterwards is guaranteed. Better than any laxative ;-)
---
There was daoc. My sorc had more than 40 spell that i used each time. Daoc was a fucking game. Better than Eve. But official server are empty now.
---
Most C3 Sites have wave dps values of like 800 or so. But like how do u sig tank in a BC? its got pretty big sig if u shield tank it...
---
Easy question ! Easy answer! Shoot their FC and TDSIN falls into disarray. Or have a doctrine that specializes in countering mindless ramming FCs.
---
32bit client is fine for multiboxing.
---
I don't think blizzard uses privat server code. And even if, it's theirs to begin with x).
---
Maybe literally give them to any other ship than BLOPs Battleships...
---
Eh they’re not so bad :)
---
I felt the same way...until a few months ago I put up a POS for the first time since the citadel expansion. I had forgotten just how bad they were.
---
Lesson learned, I’m a video noob
---
Looks fun if only you guys had a single ecmgu would of made it a lot quicker looking at the nestor fits.
---
I read english "scrubs" instead of subs . O well :D
---
while completely agree, I would also add that liking the activity also plays a big part into choosing between them. 
---
If you really like mining then by all means do that if ratting, e.g rots your mind - and the other way around :) 
---
if all you want is profits then yea, definitely go for the biggest earner.
---
Just don t forget it s still a game, you re supposed to enjoy it
---
Sadly I'm after a subset of group 4028, only the roaming recon versions, not the invasion kills. As far as I can see this is no longer possible.
---
lol, you're not wrong.
---
No cynos... no problem....what more do you want
---
Yeah, all of this is very anecdotal. People seeing what they want to see.
---
At least he doesn't have the death stare from last time he was on the launcher
---
Well that's the thing, until nullblobs turned nullsec into highsec with 'CONCORD' super umbrellas, it was both higher risk &amp; higher reward than highsec or lowsec.
---
Just light a cyno on a bling fit Marshal... watch the cyno burn... thinking of those loved and lost...  until someone warps in and blaps it
---
none :)
---
Currently we are on faerlina since we started planning day they opened, but friday we are gonna re evaluate and see if we need to move to one of the new ones. Have 4 eve related guilds/groups committed to playing on a mutual server so far
---
Not having  really read the event description (my fault obviously) I just heard there were gonna be capitals to shoot, I thought it was gonna be some actual combat event against CCP/GM folks. Then I figured oh well, at least the botters are gonna be surprised.... only that they weren't after all. Pfft.
---
Hahaha funny coincidence ... i was in that specific wormhole two days ago , scanning and solo roaming around to find a fight and i checked zkill for every wh that i passed (in total around 25-30 or so in a direct chain). So found that br on zkill and told my guys in teamspeak, that there was your fight in that wormhole and i have not heard of any of the groups involved but you guys lost in total over 10B, which is a really good amount and it very was nice to see there are groups in low-class space that have nice brawls against each other with a reasonable amount of toons involved.
---
And now i find that particular fight here :D
---
Very nice thing :)
---
A few people in apex armor brawl ships, in a small scale armor brawl... Seems to line up pretty well. Any 10 man comp that can punch through that much remote rep is feed bait for the numbers that a high class brawl corp can bring, FYI. The likelihood of encountering them in low class isn't high though, and your later comparison to a 60 man TDSIN fleet is meaningless. Please tell me a 10 man comp that can punch through the remote reps on a 60 man sleip fleet with adequate logi though, I'm all ears.
---
What's with the C4 hate I see being thrown around?
---
Yeah ripping some random boter out of space and them settings rabbit army of care bears on em seems like an amazing event. Unfortunately if it turns out that the person they ripped out of null wasn't a bot but actually a player ccp could be in some real deep shit.
---
lifehack = press the next arrow
---
You are fucked against cyno bomber : he declaok lock you in 1 sec and disrupt + cyno.
---
You can be align it changes nothing.
---
2 years of carrier ratting here. Ans 2 years of hotdroping carrier with cyno bomber. Super are still ok.
---
Whats the best way to level up faction/corp standings for a Jita trade alt?
---
I was tempted.
---
&gt; that scary forced smile
---
It's a grimace. Just because I get paid to read this sub, doesn't mean I have to like it ;)
---
If you mean that the overview doesn't update, this can happen when your targeting key gets stuck down. The overview remains static when you're targeting, doing things like greying out ships that leave grid, so that you have an easier time of it. Try pressing your targeting key again when this happens, that usually unsticks it.
---
&gt;its a next step of blackout with removing overview.
---
Don't suggest things like that, r/eve is a bad enough spergfest as-is.
---
Look! Ratting and mining is down!
---
No shit.
---
Same, fans never even used to spin up on my laptop while running a single client, now they do. I've always maxed settings too
---
Some people are really mad about their cheese being moved.
---
Wee woo wee woo wee woo! :)
---
Most alliences have cynos anchored in each system, a blops or titan bridges a cyno in and that guy lights it for the capital response. 
---
Umbrellas will still work.
---
Bob is pleased
---
64-Bit Client is using 15-17% flying in space (FIS) with everything maxed out running at 2k res. 10% Sitting in Station.
---
32-Bit Client 9-12% Fying in Space - 3-5% Sitting in Station.
---
God damn. CCP are gonna have to run another login SP event just to counteract the drop in players due to this image alone. 
---
^I'm ^joking ^Falcon ^ur ^a ^beautiful ^man ^pls ^don't ^nerf ^everything ^I ^enjoy ^about ^the ^game ^thank ^u.
---
Hisec connection is always a huge risk factor. So you should definitely have someone in an alt sitting on the hole. Can even be in a t1 frig on the hisec side (but cloaked is best). Just so the scout hears the wormhole activation sound even if the scout client is running in the background.
---
Otherwise, scan all the active connections and scout all open wormholes if possible. And if a new signature pops up, always assume that it's a new wormhole and a gank fleet just rolled into you.
---
Rip srp
---
&gt;Just loot at the fraternity vs test war. Test has structures literally in frats staging. And frat can't do anything about it.
---
We do.  And it's bullshit.
---
I have personal ships in like half of them. And if they die my stuff gets automatically consolidated instead of spread through half of wicked creek.
---
It absolutely should be more difficult to anchor structures in hostile space.  We'd still have forts in the systems we've taken, but that'd be a lot more fair.

---
C1's arent dead tbh. They are actually quite frequently used with people that are actually willing to fight. Due to the hole restrictions, a C1 is most often (due to the wormhole masses of 20mill kg per ship) camped to fuck.
---
Talking from experience, been camping my own C1 N110 exit alot lately \^\^
---
&gt;Sandbox
---
&gt;It's not meant to be used for a thing I don't like
---
Pick one. Battleships aren't meant to be used for mining, but I'll still do what I want.
---
what? your comment has absolutely nothing to do with the proposal.
---
It's about changing cynojammers in a way offensive attacks are possible again via cynos
---
Clarion call 3 "NOVA" have watch at leased 100 times. And might just watch it again
---
Exploration and Abyssal space can be done solo and are potentially way more lucrative than rorqing normal ore. 
---
For more passive income you can do PI and industry. If you have a good setup it can generate you well over 1b/hour for your work, though it is of course limited the amount of hours you can spend doing anything productive per month. It's also super boring for the most part, but pay is good.
---
Fair point.  I'm on a salary.
---
I just knew you were a rando Goon linemember.  I knew it.  Unless you're trying to tell me you're responsible for all 42,000 kills in that corp, I'm not interested.  Show me YOUR killboard so we can see who's elite.
---
Pay someone on the forums.
---
Maybe, but more likely, if a smaller ship is shooting your MTU you have to figure he's got a plan and a fit ready to take you down. I kill stuff all the time because the other guy thinks, "Gee, that's just a little assault frigate.  What even is an Ishkur?  I'll just one shot him and get rid of him..."

---
C1s can be great for camping I agree, general rule of thumb, the closer your HS to Jita, the higher chance of pew.
---
With a large-ish group there are no real requirements because you can kill the sleepers so quickly that even a modest passive tank will be enough.
---
Not really worth it though because ISK/hour is crap in large groups. Efficiently running sites is another story, should be done alone or with max 2-3 people and so requires a lot more SP and knowledge to do right.
---
Haven't played EVE in a while, but back then I'd not bother to run sites for any less than \~300m/hour, solo. Was never interested to run with corpmates because most people suck and do it wrong, so the pay is shit. Inevitably, some people will show up in cheap shit fits and contribute almost nothing but still demand an equal cut.
---
No mining permit. Glad to be on that kill.
---
Give this man a job at CCP!
---
i can assure you keeping a super in a smaller group without a keepstar is impossable. pos's allow titan bridges to be used on smaller groups (it is super fun dropping cheap shit all day on dudes out roaming)
---
The chances of a cyno bomber yet to g into a regions with out zero Intel it's pretty slim
---
HICs were never meant to be used to roll WHs.
---
You're so fucking blind no wonder you stick to noob baiting. Hehe
---
Have the alt join caldari milita and level the standings using missions. When I was uping the standings on my amarr puller it took like 4 hours for nearly maxed standings using the the new drugs.
---
In my eyes once it's paid off it's time for a whelp but you do have to feel bad for the poor bastard who finally got his carrier goes to his first site ans gets ganked due to cloaky campers.
---
Hit esc &gt; reset settings &gt; reset skill buy confirmation or something like that. I had the same issue and this worked.
---
alot of people asking this, im not sure why, theres one of 4 choices. nothing more, and it would im sure be more personal preference like it is now.
---
Neut, smartbomb, FSU or meme salvager
---
Seems perfectly safe to me
---
Uhm yeah what is it your flying? cause there is a lot of things im seeing
---
You can't board a ship that is locked by another player. Good luck getting your 200 man newbean fleet to all unlock the carrier :P
---
Here is a good example of why instawarps outside of stations are a good thing and should be made regularly.
---
C4 may be the hardest for noobs because you need extreme range to even hit the sleepers in some sites. Unless they changed that recently.
---
Required weapon range is much lower in C3 as well as most C5 sites.
---
The game is a bit silly, as it is not really a hunt. GM ejects a can and waits somewhere, so you'd have to randomly stumble over one of them to get loot. If you know the GM name you can locate him by agent and then ceptor there.
---
just rolled 3times scanned 3-4 deep and didnt have ANY incomings or wanderings.. so yeah.
---
i think its just ppl seeing/feeling what they want to see. with a combination of good luck.
---
&gt;Hisec connection is always a huge risk factor.
---
There's definitely lots of places a hs can exit that really aren't that high risk. If it exits in like solitude or backwater minmatar HS or something you're probably going to be fine. Honestly those are probably lower risk than a lowsec that comes out in FW space or a delve null
---
Your fit and my emotions are at odds with each other
---
I’ve noticed opening the map is significantly slower. It feels like it takes twice as long.
---
In game fitting simulator.
---
you ain't heard shit
---
&gt;and so requires a lot more SP and knowledge to do right.
---
Tinker snakes and nestors take like 5-7m sp, I'd hardly call them a high sp doctrine
---
How many people do you want to bring and when do you plan to do it?
---
All wormholes can be perfectly safe or hellish, depending on who you have on the chain. Farming in the static of an active corp is suicide for exemple.
---
The class of wormhole you will choose depend on what you can bring to farm it. It can be safer to farm a C5 with a Nestor/Leshak fleet if you play out of prime times in a calm chain than taking a Drake to farm a lowclass wormhole with an HS exit at 5 jump of Jita...
---
So if you want to reduce chance of being attacked you can:
---
\-Explore at least all wormhole 2 jumps around your target wormhole and check who live there before starting farm.
---
\-Get your entrance at least 15 or 20 jumps out of Jita.
---
\-Probe EVERYTHING in the system, keep an eye for new signature, a new signature have high probability to be a K162 opened by a player.
---
\-D-Scan, always, all the time.
---
\-Get diferents safes, safes are personal, not for the groupe, and make a tactical at your return hole to avoid bubbles.
---
\-Avoid prime times of the differents time zones.
---
\-Farm in sleeper data/relic sites so if the enemy didn't BM every sig before hand, they will have to wait you on the hole or combat probe you.
---
\-Put a scout on every entrance.
---
Most of the time somebody in another alliance did mining and you just buy the resources on the market, but even if it's your own alliance they often just sell the resources to alliance. 
---
Stop pretending this is some massive undertaking, the issue with k-space keep stars for small groups isn't one of construction cost either, the issue is one of attention.
---
Eh its just fresh system/game install, and got new keyboard old was broken. Everything updates and now i see why W7 was a better for playing EVE :D
---
Windowed EVE client in W10 is a bit broken if u move it at multiple screens. Some UI elements are disapearing or scaling to god only know size. 
---
Ill wait if this overview freez thing repeats, lets hope not cause its a die button to my poor ships.
---
I noticed a difference in missile hits between a drake and a scorpion navy with which i tested (Admittedly in a c4). The scorp has a 600m sig and the drake a 400m sig.   
---
The numbers seemed lower on the drake, coupled with a better moving speed etc (drakes had ab, sni had mjd). Might be just anecdotal - but the core of it is I've had a drake tank the fort in a c3 (not sure the outpost 2bs wave).   
---
anyways this is purely theoretical as the dps is abysmal (since you need all the lows for regen) and OP wanted something for a group, but I like doing this PVE science sessions :)
---
Eve workbench, my mate. Google it. Cheers.
---
Goddamn bombers should watch what they fly into! Oh wait...
---
Fleet of newbeans is another story alltogether, better to let them kill it and get a nice killmail
---
IN SPACE NO ONE HEAR YOU SHITPOST!
---
tyvm will try
---
There is r/fittings
---
As someone that runs a new player Corp, the things you see are amazing.
---
zkillboard dot com
---
I'm not experiencing this on linux 64bit
---
Have the same feeling more wandering holes at home, and trice this week we opened our static in our previous static.
---
I remember long time ago on forum people speaking about static not opening in a total random way, but with a probability decreasing with the number of holes already opened in the destination system.
---
I cant find it back, does someone remember that?
---
Same. I'm choking running two clients with my graphics turned down. I guess I'm playing in 32 bit again.
---
i don't doubt that i've been there and seen it.
---
Do you work for CCP fitting team?
---
Is there any non gimped fit I can use for combat probing and then ganking T1 frigs in lowsec? 
---
Possibly a destroyer?
---
The frigate menace has infected the triglavians. Engage your RLML Orthruses!
---
They should add cyno beacon between his hands, or animation: "Falcon crashing cyno with his hands"
---
Thank you for the insight! But can you tell what is a static wormhole and how to identify one?
---
Thanks for not killing my ears with terrible music.
---
You should check out my other videos :P
---
I feel like we are getting more wondering holes.
---
And massacres
---
The combat booster sites are also a possibility. For example, https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Core_Runner_Exile_Production_Facility
---
on the streamer server? ok have fun lol
---
Did you have bulkhead rigs too? A hull tank compliments a shield and armor tank. When all three are on a ship it is called the trifecta tank.    /s
---
Hahahaha.
---
Haha.
---
Yes.
---
I said kind of, not that I actually do.
---
Temptation should never be resisted.
---
It’s not luck. It’s selection. Many people skip the combat booster sites (e.g. https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Core_Runner_Exile_Production_Facility ) or other sites with NPC’s in them. Most explorers tend to run the ones without NPC’s (e.g. ruined Guristas Crystal Quarry). Check our this page for kore info:
---
https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Relic_and_data_sites
---
Because CCP used to listen to nullsec and it took them this long to realize all the changes suggested by null turned the game in the current shit state.
---
Groups that gravitate towards c4s tend to have the numbers to be able to move into a c5 without any problems but don't because they're either risk averse or to lazy to deal with the logistics of living in a 5-5. Also you can't bring caps into a 4, but you can build them there allowing c4 corps to cap blob with impunity (atleast until a larger group catches wind of it).
---
TL;dr the people who live there tend to be cucks
---
How dare you.
---
(Cries as well)
---
Sure fair point. I love myself some theory testing too. Spend most my time on pyfa punching away at nunbers lol
---
Hmm, Talwars are weird. Are there any decent doctrine fits?
---
This is definitely something that can be debated. Definitely less buggy and make life simpler on logi dudes, but the actual effect on the game is not *clearly* better than if they hadn't been introduced
---
Hurrr
---
good vid, but why switch songs every minute?
---
are you sure its not a [battle onion](https://invadingyourhole.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-battle-onion-fan-fiction-this-may.html) ?
---
The game is dying regardless so that's immaterial. What we really enjoy is watching the desperate shilling from faggot fanbois, genuinely expecting someone like CCP Rise, who astonishes everyone with the fact he is allowed to be left alone near anything more complex than a fisher price phone, to resuscitate the thing using meme ideas from the EVE-O forums.
---
no
---
I take it you're a goon. I personally cant fault you for playing the game and having fun.
---
bombers have a 5s lock delay when exiting cloak
---
What kind of chaos would we have if we had MERs? In chaos you have no idea how you're doing economically because; chaos.
---
You can. But a logical step before titans are supers
---
Every wormhole system is always connected to 1 or 2 others types of systems. Let's take an exemple:
---
J001348 is a shattered C3, if you google the name of system (J-tag) you will get this page [http://www.ellatha.com/eve/WormholeSystemview.asp?key=001348](http://www.ellatha.com/eve/WormholeSystemview.asp?key=001348)
---
There, you can see "**Static WHs:**  [**D845**](http://www.ellatha.com/eve/wormholelistview.asp?key=Wormhole+D845) [**U210**](http://www.ellatha.com/eve/wormholelistview.asp?key=Wormhole+U210)**"**, it means you will ALWAYS find a wormhole leading to a low sec (U210) and a another leading to a high sec (D845). Plus wandering holes and K162.
---
If you want the full list of possible holes: [http://www.ellatha.com/eve/wormholelist.asp](http://www.ellatha.com/eve/wormholelist.asp)
---
And for the K162, it's ALWAYS the name of the hole exit.
---
(If not named K162= Entrance, if named K162 = Exit)
---
I like it.....battle onion. Perfect name for it.
---
thought this was related to linux, which I switched to recently..
---
those who live in C2 with null statics are straight up Africanized
---
I stand corrected.
---
oh , no ! muh skins !!
---
Lowsec just fights. There used to be mini wars when moons were passive income, but now everyone just kills whoever. Small gang is making a comeback in lowsec.
---
Not *really*. Closest you really get is when snuff are bored and go shoot sgrrns stuff then drop titan blob when they start losing.
---
please
---
or any of the systems close to the newbie starter systems \^\^ alot of squeesy scanning ships that go pop with a single alpha shot
---
Apparently to justify having the Dromi, which can catch and web things smaller than a battleship.
---
What you are saying is absolutely wrong.
---
Leshaks by nature are stronger in smaller-scale engagements.
---
Aside from a lack of jams, I can't think of a better smallgang setup to break the fleet they fought.
---
This ^^^^^
---
I know, though they could just not "immediately" ban some recent cases and transport them. Yet it is of course easy to see that this would allow the bots to operate for the duration (not that they deal with bots very swiftly in most cases anyway) and wouldn't necessarily accrue reasonable numbers of targets to even call it an event. And of course, bots or not, the targets might not be logged in at the time anyway. So yeah, not really practical, but a man can dream. Though I still would've preferred an actual combat event over even that.
---
Cherish these fights! 
---
We don't get them much anymore and smallgang heavy armor is one of the funnest fleets because every individual truly matters
---
I wasn't in provi at the time.
---
Once more you assume you know everything, and prove you know nothing in the process.
---
the killmail shows stuff from the plastic wraps (the spod)
---
DHSJ wiping out the Yondu jokesters one citadel at a time!
---
Ah yeah youre right; well just 1 RF timer and only 1 per system; stops working once RF'ed... I think that would make it better.
---
just make sure you have a beacon in system problem solved
---
There's a hell lot of difference between a thrasher and an assault frig. Let us stick to the initial case here. If I'm ratting in a gila or something and I see a thrasher shooting my mtu and I decide to engage him. What's the worst that could happen? 
---
The way I see it, I can just 2 shot it, grab my mtu and warp off. Do I turn into a suspect when I shoot a suspect or do I just get the limited engagement timer?
---
Well, it does feel like I'm in Sunday school again, but it sure ain't God staring at me creepily
---
\^\^This!
---
No, why?
---
it's a freighter with a bunch of random stuff on it. Don't ask.
---
His t-shirt is cool though.
---
industrial ?
---
Oh not fair, we come to w-space for Bob. Nothing more nothing less. 
---
An those true to Bob aren't real we don't exist. We are a bad dream a memory yet unplaced.
---
But to be fair most wouldn't understand that. 
---
Wake up sleepers....wake up
---
Exactly. Please do tell.
---
70m sp and assets everywhere but it's mostly corpses and various loot from fights worth less than 500m total
---
Blocs aren't really in our mindset, I think we'd mostly prefer to have ~50 man fleets and brawl for the fun of it.
---
There have been some lame attempts by SGGRN/SC, but they didn't really amount to much.  For the rest of us, our blue lists are pretty short to non-existent.
---
Big daddy Snuff don't really count, as war implies two sides are fighting, but they're too big for most of us to bother with.
---
This game has been dying since 2004 if you listen to the peanut gallery.
---
He's in V0LTA, it's common for people on /r/eve to use wrong flairs to 'bait' a funny response because of other users guessing their alliance.
---
I mean, what's even the point in taking Sov now?  Not only are the warfare mechanics total cancer, but CCP is determined to make damn sure there's no incentive to actually live in Null.
---
#savethespacewhale
---
Yep. My ryzen 2700 quite happily runs as many eve clients as I desire.
---
I believe they're implying that your fit is shit.
---
It's only a war if they can fight back, batphoning a bunch of dudes to guarantee a win isn't something to brag about my brother.
---
I have the same when I click my character skill window. I click the icon, the window opens (without the character model) and the CPU shoots up to 100% while the model loads, then goes back to normal.
---
Happens every time I open the character window, even if I close &amp; reopen straight away.
---
It didn't behave like this on the 32bit version.
---
there is a reason why people use the vigil [loosie here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil_(liturgy) )
---
hmmm, my character loads, just the client locks up for me, but you saying that in the settings i may click 'low quality characters' to see if this improves things
---
they always said trouble comes in threes, little did we know this was all along, a riddle to warn us of the Pythagoras worshiping invaders
---
then why not stay in wormhole space - why do you guys INSIST on coming into null?
---
I'll have to check it out. 30-40% is not a large load but running 2 clients adds up.
---
I can only imagine you move EVE between different Graphics cards or between vastly different Display resolutions (like 1080p to 4k with scaling active). 
---
I have two Monitors on one Graphics card and have no issue dragging from one Monitor to the other (using Windows 10).
---
The only attention we want is for you to come fight us. The only thing I see wormholers complain about are bugs here and there.
---
The rats web you into warp. Thank me now.
---
I don't see any changes, I scan for hours daily and some days are quiet, some days are very much not
---
Pretty little standoff, battle to the first mistake :)
---
good, anchoring fleets must die
---
You're not wrong but you shouldnt assume they dont know what they are doing.
---
bugs. no doubt an all eve thing, that im sure wormholers would state is 'their own problem'  , poor wormholers
---
and if all you want is a fight, what ive said about non capital wormholes being time based not mass based, youd definitely get that.
---
yepp, can confirm. PvP mach is pretty great for this. i
---
That’s big null blocs for you, they're kinda full of attention seekers in one way or another.
---
For the most part, the smaller PVP focused groups need to trust each other to be successful.  One of the reasons they're more difficult to get into.
---
&gt; funnest
---
your loadout is as bad as my posting
---
Maybe readd ACL to the Neocom (I seemed to have lost mine, use hot keys now)
---
I'm looking for some heavy armor anti-frigate, preferably in the cruiser/battlecruiser size range. I've been playing with ships like the prophecy and hurricane but I can't seem to find something that has the good staying power of the rest of our main doc, but can also clear frigs. Any suggestions?
---
No citadel should take longer than 2D, 12 hours to kill. Change my mind.
---
Well there are a lot of mechanics specific to wormholes that have bugs here and there, which is what I was talking about. 
---
You can fit plenty of ships through a Large hole and still have plenty of mass left to extract. Especially, if you're flying BCs and down. You just can't blob.
---
I feel people have more problems with the tone and choice of words rather than what he's actually saying.
---
We are not a Reddit corp, this is correct.
---
From what I've seen they do indeed keep spawning, although the spot where they pop up in system seems to shift.
---
eating butter with a spoon while browsing 4chan ... nothing wrong with that ....
---
That roleplay with himself in chat tho
---
&gt; funnesterer
---
I hope they nerf Reddit next... that shit is OP
---
This happens to me now. If I have more than one client running opening the character tab about gives my computer a heart attack. Often makes music skip. No idea what information it's loading that's so intense.
---
Ran 64bit client perfectly fine up until the June 25 update and that is when I started having performance problems.
---
Switched to 32bit and can play for hours with absolutely no problems.
---
Because easy kills, also to annoy you, and to farm your space.
---
And there are no supers in WH, and rorquals are rare.
---
Wow... I've never seen so many at one place, outside a conduit!
---
I can't tell if he is trying to look badass and imposing, or trying to do some kind of "come gaze on the wonders of space inside ahhh hahahahha\~\~\~\~" thing, or maybe he just stepped on a lego while giving an important presentation and has to look happy and exited so he can't yell "YAU MY FUCKING FOOT" so he lands in between in this cringe face.
---
That's a pretty cool mega. Is it one of the officially released models? I've heard there were some of them released early...
---
More like every 30 seconds but I assume something to do with copyright
---
goddamn do stuka fleets make bombing look like the most f1 monkey blob activity compared to even basic multi-vector runs. It's just approach and fire as many as you fucking can, very cool
---
So the info at the site is incorrect then?
---
Not a finished product but an API for google &gt; [GESI](https://github.com/Blacksmoke16/GESI)

---
Sure is! Released in 2007 I think, navy mega version
---
&gt; Snuff came to assist us with a few more dreads and a legion fleet coming through the gate. All caps were murdered and they jumped in a few more to feed into us. 
---
As I read that bit I expected it to say"  Snuff came to assist us with a few more dreads and hazed both of us after joining our fleet"
---
They clearly said that the faucet stopped because of blackout.
---
my super sitter logged off on a fort would disagree with you
---
nice comms ;-) I had fun
---
"The highest MER the likes of which the world has never seen before"
---
lol okay I guess nobody ever had one before Citadels
---
The shit is fit.
---
I don't think so.  Im also seeing massive chains.  I love in a C2 C3/HS and the C3s more often than not have a large number of both incoming and outgoing connections.
---
super? size of a battleship. no real use for fun except hotdrops on fleets that cant handle it if your a small group. im talking about storing a bridge titan, my apologies for saying 'super' i call titans supers as they're super capitals. that is an issue of mine i accept responsibility of.
---
but i have been part of successful hunts of people who thought they were safe doing what you did.
---
People automate ship actions to make in game money. CCP took some expensive ships owned by known botters, and put them in high security space and allowed other players to destroy these ships.
---
How difficult is it to run in Linux?
---
Same question. I heard through discord while I was at work :(
---
We cant hear you over nullsec burning....(even more static)
---
murk, yeah they kinda suck, citadels have a ton of QOL improvements from a logistical standpoint, but their gameplay changes have had a negative impact on the game.
---
POSes, for their sins, were a good way of generating content through being beachheads, or R64 timers, or death stars, or dick stars, or fleet warp traps off the GE- station, etc etc.
---
I learned: Overview freezes, when mouse cursor is in overview window. Then a smal lock is displayed on top of the sorted column
---
Haha, that's awesome! Thank you for explaining o7
---
Are they trying to make Test look bad with this one? https://zkillboard.com/kill/42854487/ (one of the bots)
---
What? Of course that’s the case. A huge number of wormholers would like changes, there’s a huge list of things ccp had planned to implement and just dropped as QoL for wormholes. 
---
However
---
Most of us don’t think they can even get the simple stuff done without severely breaking other stuff, so we mostly just don’t ask.
---
Also, there’s a huge difference in living in a hole with 25-60 pvp guys, versus having a solo bearhole. Solo bearhole that never intends to pvp is a bit like VNI ratting, once you get your structure down you don’t even have to roll holes. Hell, most solo dudes in bear holes don’t even know *how* to roll holes.
---
I’m sure I could pick up super ratting in less than an hour if I decided it was worth my time. Maybe not with the best ticks, but it’d be pretty simple.
---
Great!
---
You dis da Suc Suc you get da Boom Boom
---
210 m/s tops speed, 5 mid slots, 5 lowslots, and at least 30m3 drone bay?  That my friend is a celestis.  A very abused celestis.
---
This is a silly comment LOL
---
sure, anything can be picked up in an hour or less by experianced eve'ers like us and many many others.
---
but its how hard is it to actually get good at it that i think may decide here what is 'difficult'
---
i can happily admit to having issues with fighters being hit alot, loosing on here and there while learning, letting your fighters stop moving after each kill (bad bad)  theres alot more to super ratting than say, VNI ratting but just in a bigger ship.
---
its quite high APM required to super rat effectively. never mind the silly numbers some people get.
---
all this while scanning, and soon, also ensuring your recon alt is on grid cloaked ready to go.
---
Found the spai
---
Oh I didn’t know that everyone  had  to stay in their Null, low, WH, HS little boxes?
---
Hull tanked brutix is nice
---
imagine broadcasting eve with screenshake turned on
---
Funnnnnessssst. Look at this Boris guy. I mean what a Maroon.
---
Are you maximising your m3 per trip by fitting the mods?
---
had one what, supercapital/titan. or POS?
---
of course people had them.  but people also got a fuck site better at catching them lol and having the standby to kill it if they happened to catch it.
---
on my machine it's chrome. whenever adservers change ads on hidden pages EVE starts stumbling...
---
aeschee only has 3 total systems? you dont get some like 3-5j away?
---
Scan liberally. If you find a hole you need to check all its connections to ensure no big wormhole corps are occupying nearby holes.
---
Also you want to find 'dead holes' these are holes that are full of signatures because there is no active corp living there to do them.
---
A couple safety tricks. Mass crit connecting wormholes to the hole you want to do. This will deter fleets from coming through. If you have spare alts you can sit them on active wormholes in a cloaky and crank up the sound volume so you can hear wormhole activations.
---
I've used confessor with decent results but you may need to splurge on faction scrams if you want to hunt stabbed asteros and the like.
---
Supers before citadels both existed and were used frequently. Bridging from a POS was no more difficult than bridging from a citadel.
---
Even moving around wasn't too bad pre-garage dooring, and given you could only catch supers and titans with HICs or bubbles, it was a difficult task to capture supers.
---
Obviously it happened, but it still happens. Retards are retarded.
---
This is what I took from.iy also
---
fun has different definitions by different people. Enjoy it anyway ! ;)
---
Warp speed has literally nothing to do with it. Once you hit warp you cannot even be stop-bubbled...
---
Ok i was thinking that it was just my PC doing strange stuff.       
---
Sometimes video playing in browsers/players freezes when i have EVE client running.         
---
This also happens when i see small freezes in eve clients.         
---
This also never happens when eve clients are not running , also when PC have heavy load.                 
---
Probably quite important part here - often client becomes "greyed out at this point" like something meant to open , but failed.    Keyboard shortcuts work, but there is no chance to click any object using mouse.          
---
^(aka no way bug report it ingame )
---
I catch a lot of cap with cyno bomber before the BO so with it it s just easier. 
---
But like i said already there are few people ratting in carrier now.
---
looks to me like elderly KANE from Command and Conquer
---
still, wtf are you speaking about?
---
What you propose is helping very little. It's hell to RF a jammer, even one active jammer.
---
You basically write random stuff, and kinda want to insult me? All it does, is question your ability to understand what I proposed...
---
Yup, yet it's still here, go figure
---
The HIC change would have decreased risk. They fixed it because it would be ridiculous not to.
---
I also see impact how EVE and browser behave at the same time.      
---
Strangely movies stop playing for me - or should i say video playback freezes like it was paused - but sound is still playing and moving window with the video restarts the video output to normal.
---
I fucking hearded it with my own ears mate!

yes, im saying exactly that mate lol. im saying bridging from a fort (or more likely a astrahouse) because many small corps cannt afford to place a fort, nor defend it, but one or two dudes could afford or owned a titan,
---
astra/fort is more dangerous than bridging from a pos (large preferred lol)
---
"implying"
---
You should try dual dread ratting 😉😉
---
Did you her it from your mums friends sisters uncles dog aye?
---
I know, we didnt know. Thats why friday we probs relocate
---
Yes, but you decline those.
---
Between the chat you had with yourself in local and how you fitted what I can only guess is a Nereus, I'm guessing those Triglavians where there specifically to shoot at you.
---
gonna need bout treefiddy
---
He was in the haulers channel some hours before talking about a 20b trip
---
Boys are back in town
---
I UNDERSTOOD THIS REFERENCE!!
---
Hi from the other side,
---
Nice to see the video here. We are so new to wormhole and didn't even record this amazing brawl. We had an incredible amount of fun and personally speaking the most fun I had playing eve. I'm very glad that we made the decision to move out of nullsec so that we could enjoy this precious content that wormhole has to offer.
---
We wanted this fight from the beginning but it took us a little while to get ready (~~get rid of the eve shakes~~). As a newer wormhole corp we learnt a tons of stuff from this and we appreciate you all for fighting with us.
---
Looking forward to having the next fight with you guys, or anyone that is willing.

100k ehp and 750 dps is inferior. Rattle has about the same stat's using gecko. Plus you forgot they scale better then Rattlesnakes, and can refit off each other dropping the need for mobile depot. Also, being armor leaves mids open for damage application as well a MJD and tackle for the drifter. 
---
Was in a WH for over a year running C5 sites. We started with the rattle but then moved to nestors for easier usage, low mass means more dudes in fleet and faster warp times when bad's showed up. Since you run them with RnR, new bros can fly VNI's or a Vexxor and still be effective in the sites. It's a lot less work to run drifter in nestors. No cap = no tank for rattles, where as the nestor is just fine.
---
Woah woah woah... let's slow down a tick here.   We don't wanna say something we can't take back.
---
I guess I'm not sure why we are arguing then? Although it's still pretty risk free to bridge from an Astra unless they have several bumping Lifs and you're not paying any attention.
---
And defending a fort is easier than defending a POS since POSes didn't have TZ tanking (which was the main thrust of this post)
---
Same here, but I suspect it more related to active gameplay, I.e. frequent session changes. Only restart helps.
---
Good tips, thanks! Also what do you mean by "Mass crit connecting WHs"?
---
That's what I thought. I just got unlucky
---
The Drifter will only spawn by shooting the uncloaked relay that spawn during the last wave. Dont shoot it, dont even lock it. Just leave it alone and the drifter will not spawn. Loot site with MTU as normal
---
This is really missing a watchlist.. aaah..
---
Why was one nestor alone? This seems to have turned the fight but why did he fuck up?
---
Yep, enjoying watching the zkill feed from my comfy bed at 5 am 😊.
---
Hope everyone had fun in the slugfest.
---
It was found out that I am in fact very unlucky.  Most relic sites don't have NPCs in null but some do. I am not wrong and you're being an ass
---
Its more simple, i have one graphics and move already windowed game. Its not cutting window but the game display is zoomed :D
---
I dont think hardware is a problem if it works properly on the same setup at diffrent OS.
---
Sure because not having capitals escalate on you and having a relatively controlled environment regarding the size of a fight is like the one big plus for doing wormhole pvp, let's ruin it by enabling cynos there.
---
Wasn't this foretold? Weren't people saying that now there was going to be accounts made that all they do is "watch" the gates for activation?
---
rip my avatar
---
gf guys
---
Which is their ratting system
---
PVP and it had local
---
I wish. But I don't have that kind of time to spend grinding like I did when I was younger.
---
I noticed them scanning player owned structures in high sec.
---
Seems like free kills if you can get a covert cyno and bombers in system. 
---
Identify their docking point, put up a drag bubble, collect kills.
---
Only so much ship mass can go through a wormhole before it collapses. What you want to do is put so much mass back and forth through a wormhole that the wormhole becomes 'on verge of collapse' meaning a single battleship will close it if it comes through. 
---
Usually you mass crit with battleships using Higgs rigs to artificially increase mass.
---
A class 3 wormhole can be about 2 billion kg of mass. A raven with a higgs rig is 200k Add a MWD and its 300k. Then it only takes a handful of jumps to either close a wormhole outright or make it critical.
---
It’s far less isk/min if you want to actually compare ratting methods. 
---
There’s a lot more tedium involved even getting paid. You have to collect, salvage, haul, and sell all the loot to highsec. No jump freighters etc.
---
Dscan is just as important and new probe sigs more so. 
---
Having multiple 2-3 cloaky alts on doors May be necessary instead of a single cyno alt. 
---
Dreads do ok if that is ALL that the entire wormhole is for, but once you run all your sites you’re done for a week (waiting on site respawn). Those same dreads also have zero chance of fighting back if caught.
---
I’m sure I could find more to go on about...
---
I get low fps around gates
---
No dead tits for the last 15 mins is it over or TD? Someone gonna point that Molok?
---
Yeah, and also anything that is really tedious, like watching a gate constantly, is going to be done better by bots then players.
---
More nerfs to pve &lt;3
---
You joke but roqs with geckos are probably  gonna be way more reliable than carriers.

---
some what accurate BR
---
Its been like this for some skins since introduction like 4 years ago
---
Not a silver bullet, but increase wormhole spawn rates into these kinds of systems, should hopefully result in more traffic coming in which don't use gates
---
fucking yonis. TAU big balls!
---
Why wouldn't they just put a cloaky on the gate instead of losing pods?
---
Baguette man are you being a c4 brain?
---
It was a massive undertaking in the beginning.  Then it spitballed.  If it was so easy, then all the small groups would have them.  I mean, seriously - the argument is that only big groups can have keepstars, but it's SO EASY TO MAKE THEM so it's not really an accomplishment? 
---
How does that make any fucking sense?
---
Remove gates and overview
---
I don’t speak the language but I understood enough to say “Nice”
---
Pods are free and need no logistics to skillpoints. Cloaky ships do.
---
I thought I was the only one buggered by it.

---
Thanks everyone involved for making EVE interesting
---
no.
---
Did u read the only sentence below the link? And cant you do a pipebomb without them?
---
If you mine it yourself it is free.
---
Because you can use alpha accounts, and it's fairly trivial to set death clone to that system and just warp them back
---
Wish there were more penisez of his size in new eden
---
It's tidi
---
Yes, CCP, as you can see we need to nerf null sec even further. Delete structures, don't allow old POSes to be anchored, and make everyone who logs in space stay there permanently. 
---
Then, please fix probes by reverting your probe changes and go back to the old system where I just press a button on my overview and get a warp to location, without having to position probes at all--why waste the 'hunter's' time--and maybe, instead of actually having to warp to the target make it so 'hunter's' in sov space immediately appear next to their target. 
---
That way everything will finally be fair... as long as you also make fleet change, alliance chat, and any player created intel channel also completely unavailable to people in sov space. 
---
In fact, why even bother with sov space at all... just turn it into a giant PVP arena where when the 'hunter's' show up they can 'elite pvp,' but click a button to turn off their pvp flag the moment a sov holder ship shows up. That way, EVE will be fun again.
---
Holy shit... That was one of the most amazing fights I have been in... I love throwing my dread around and DAMN... THAT WAS AWESOME!!!

They've lost 164 Plat, 195 Silver?  That's gonna hurt.
---
no it isn't, we extracted quite a bit ago
---
I have not seen 9 Titan losses in 2019. What a battle.
---
The amount of effort put into getting this on YouTube then Reddit is almost as impressive as the elite PvP that killed Nobu!
---
we killed 5 titans and lost 4, so technically we won :honk:
---
Ha! What a silly mistake.
---
Ah right alphas
---
GOTG is often decides to stand down and they do not fight. Goonswarm loves to fight.
---
they have about 8 of them you can clearly identify them as the only systems with people in space in that region.

Good job on recognizing what it is though. My dumbass was stumped trying to figure it out.
---
Last I tried using them in pvp I shot my fleet mates. I've stayed away from them since
---
Kudos to people for having big balls and going all in.
---
we are working on farming them but it doesn't seem to make a dent i believe this post is an attempt to call for reinforcements to the cause.
---
7 chinese dead vs 2 snuff
---
Every time I see CCP Falcon face when I log in, I am really encouraged to de-activate my only remaining account. Same whenever Hilmar gives an interview.
---
no they are garbage dont use them
---
ok?
---
Good kills. Well most of them are not too unexpected, except the stratios that did not shoot back, and the garmur that failed to turn on his mwd again. So many coercer kills,we don't see them in gal/cal that much.
---
How else are those carebears ever get on a capital kill?
---
It is a good clip. The action is fine.
---
Avdot is with snuff
---
This is why we own titans btw , being opressive in lowsec works
---
What do you expect of somebody who flies a CargoExpanded Charon into a GoonFleet in a tradehub?
---
The Southern Race club does use BOTS instead of playing themselves.
---
Summer vacations just ended in Iceland. Give them a minute.
---
I would appreciate Wormhole changes.
---
Accurate depiction of r/eve just a month ago.
---
Is that all the FAX GOTG had?
---
To haul a small amount of bling mods and stuff from jita I use an instawarp Hecate with some shield tank, a few core stabs and an insta undock. Obviously the Hecate can't haul as much stuff as a mammoth or other haulers but at least I don't get ganked that way.
---
I stand by my statement.  Anyone who flies a Succubus doesn't want a fair fight.
---
GF mate and good kills.  Fly dangerous! o7
---
So my highsec minerals are worth more?
---
Please be honest though, there's much less to export compared to before with the blackout. Unless you all do daily locust fleets, there isn't as much overall mining going on.
---
I've said it once, I'll say it again. Fixing botting by disallowing drones to auto aggro vs rats will make botting easier to spot (many more inputs is easier to analyse patterns for recognising bots) and stop AFK players just printingnisk without playing the game.
---
That was fun, thanks to everyone involved for having fun.  This is why we play :)
---
Well Snuff dont need Titans in few Weeks anyway^^ better whelp them while they can.
---
Yeah..... my fault on that. This is a new alpha character that I wanted to see if FW was viable for new players.  Just forgot to change the video options after making the character.
---
to 0

No fuel, No stront, no timer.

Damn I loved that system, learned so much there as a newbean.

For years XxXxDEATHXxxX and RA were shaming rus community, Solar Fleet feel apart, only Lussy Lou held our flag high, I am glad DarkSide is back to show everyone that scary russian people are still out there.
---
Can you bot rat with fax?
---
aren't EU and US having access to different servers?
---
Oof the nearest NPC system to stage out of is over 20 gates away or 3 jumps. Just resupplying enough ammo to kill these botters is going to need some commitment.
---
this feels oddly familiar 
---
in case its not copypasta i wish you good luck with EVE
---
Didn't someone make a post showing the blackout is client side, not server. 
---
So the good bots still use local as normal?
---
But yeah the blackout was never gonna stop bots. As plenty of people said, but got downvoted for saying.
---
Eve and fun? I think that's what you call an oxymoron. :P It's amazing we monthly-sub for a pretty boring sandbox that relies on player driven content to be any fun. We should be paying them players instead.
---
Poses could be killed without forming a giant fleet. No damage cap. Had stront based timers that allowed attacking corps to use tactics to get a better final timer if handled correctly. When they died Pos'es dropped the docked/ stored /in build stuff. Now Asset safety has killed any risk to the defending allliance loosing entire regions. Poses required upkeep to use ANY of the services. Citadels can sit in low power and still heal and tether a ship for free. Poses had a hard anchor limit of 5 per alliance per day per system. No such rule for citadels.
---
Bots can press F and lock targets quite easily
---
They target the nearest entity that has aggro on you. Their dps is shit and you are shit if you use them in pvp
---
Yes but as I said the additional inputs required assist in spotting bots Vs mistaking them for an AFK player.
---
The more data CCP has on a player the easier it is to ID a bot
---
Is it the left handed mouse pad?
---
Can still probe down WH sigs and watch them.
---
Till they figure out how to automate signature scanning...
---
what's wrong with the captcha idea?
---
another lowsec system )
---
Possibly confirmation bias, you'd have to scan hundreds of holes to have statistical significance
---
Improvise, Adapt, Overcome.
---
Also applicable to Bots.
---
&gt;  But super proliferation is not a buff to nullsec its somethig that happens
---
LMAO sure buddy. it just happens, like a volcano errupting. it's a law of nature
---
Show us on the doll where CCP touched your isk printer
---
Enjoy capital fights this month or chew cyno recons/blops follow months.
---
People seem convinced that there are relic site bots so apparently they've already figured that out. I don't believe it but who am I to argue with Reddit's wisdom?
---
Just a couple of notes; whilst Nestors do rep a lot, they are prime target for MJDessies and are a bit bulky and slow to move around, against a fleet like that running guards and keeping them ~40km from your fleet (and even further from the enemy fleet!) may help reduce cap pressure.
---
Looking at the BR (and watching the vid) you had no Bhaalgorns, this will really hurt you in fleet fights like these where you can't turn off enemy Logi/Leshak guns (even if you break their cycle once it resets spool).
---
Neither side had any JamGus which could have really helped break Leshak spools and Logi ships.
---
All in all looks like it waws a great brawl and I'm glad you had fun!
---
If bots are pressing F how can you tell the difference between a player pressing F? Nots can just set to press F at random delayed intervals to look like a player then.
---
Nice work both sides!
---
As for why no more fuel costs like stront, probably because there's blocks for every darn service module.
---
ty for bing a good sport :)
---
Not difficult at all.
---
The biggest problem with FOF (friend or foe) missiles, as they're also known, is their very bad dps. It usually hovers around 60% of a regular missile. The "it always targets the closest enemy" behaviour is also a big problem. When you're fighting in a fleet, the closest enemy usually changes pretty quickly, so you would never be focusing down a single enemy. They could also just switch targets relatively quickly, spreading the damage around so that nobody really dies. I imagine that you could have enough damage to always alpha an enemy off the field, but that's not super applicable.
---
The only real advantage they have is that they can start firing without target lock, so you can start firing them even if someone has damps on you, or if they're so far away that your missiles could reach, but your ship can't target that far (for example, you could shoot someone 400km away using a Raven, although you were first need to have aggroed you). That's not worth the dps cut, especially for a fleet since your whole fleet will not be damped, only a few members.
---
For example, in your missions, you're always better off using regular missiles and manually targeting each enemy. You'll kill them a lot quicker and be making more ISK/hr than if you're using FOF missiles.
---
have you even tried bombing excavators? it's not that easy, the rorq has lots of counterplay
---
Agreed, anyone from the POS era knows it was more tedious than citadels.
---
The dynamic game play might happen, and could still by perhaps extending the duration of the final timer on a citadel so it's not so pre-defined.
---
Any organized org had ceptor alts that actually adjusted on the fly and had more precise control on timers.
---
Oh I see. But is this really required if we're just daytripping? I mean we do want to be able to get out. I realise a new wormhole will open, but that can lead to a different more dangerous system.
---
yea sorry that's what i meant :)   
---
if it's powered down - just come in and pop it.
---
Jeez the salt
---
It's fine, TDSIN won't take a fight, even if they outnumber the opponent :D
---
yall are some non meme-ing motherfuckers.
---
Even scarier in small groups like this where they can have most of the fleet prelocked and their opponent doesn't have any JamGus.
---
My ocd tells you to use numbers or roman numerals but not both. What about a CIII to CIV
---
Sweet summer child..
---
Now go back to all these posts post-blackout claiming it will be the bane of all bots and move them r/Prematurecelebration
---
WTS Minokawa in Irshah ;)
---
Yeah you're right, but even in that randomness there is a pattern that a large dataset can identify.
---
An on the ball player may be (for example) pre-clicking on something or smash F multiple times or whatever. Even the mouse movements and so on can help in identifying bots.
---
It's always a battle as to the intelligence of bots Vs how easily CCP can spot them, but what's the downside? Rewriting bots costs coders time, which increases the cost of bots, which decreases appetite for botting
---
It did stop a lot of them. CCP cannot pull off anything that kills 100% of the botters without changing core game mechanics even then people will improvise and create new bots. The best we can do is to make it really hard for them to bot.
---
&gt; rip my avatar
---
Nothing of value was lost.
---
Yeah the Stratios panicked I suppose and he was a strange kitey mission fit and the Garmur tried to do the trick where he baits you to shoot as he pulls away from the gate but I have experience of that in null and was watching out for it and managed to stop him at 13km on the edge of my web. 
---
Comet is an ok ship but I guess not very exciting in terms of possible plays compared to the Hookbill for example. :)
---
This 100%! The game is so skewed towards nullsec and sov its absolutely insane! Chat channels are so broken that someone can get help from their Corp mates in their space in mere minutes is so stupid. I should be able to solo kill any ship in game as long as I fit a cloak because elite PVP!! Also using voice and chat services outside of game should be a bannable offense!

A GM could actually go take a peak at the top 10-20 F pressing players.
---
Repeated patterns even if it seems random will occur over and over after a period of time. A players actions will always be different compared to a programmed bot.
---
Go a few jumps out to lowsec and find a c3 hole there. Thhey are generally very quiet holes, good for pve.
---
It wont affect this kind of fights.
---
Cost of several recons, is not even cost of refits in one titan's cargo hold
---
I love that spin, isk war was about 2:1 against snuffed. shall I post all the pre-fight sh\*t talking from snuffed in local?
---
Can make it so you need omega skills/expensive implants to scan down these wormholes so the cost is prohibitive.
---
anyone got vid?
---
CV stands for Cataclismic Variable :p
---
Ah ok thank you for explaining
---
Looks like titans don't get slaughtered in 2019, they just Fade away
---
F
---
I wouldnt crit your entrance to the hole. I would close all roaming holes and crit all statics that I dont need.
---
Or Ill just do none of those things and scout well before hand for obvious danger and factor in the semi frequent ship loss as a cost of doing business.
---
And frankly I have seen many newbs in my clan see probes on dscan or see a scanning ship in a wormhole and continue PVEing anyways. This is a terrible idea. If a scout ship sees you then expect a cloaky tengu gang to sneak up on you soon.
---
I did it with T3C and few thousand rounds of HAM will last you a while, they are not very tanky. doable with solo torp bomber but it can be a bit risky for getting 1 shot'd if unlucky .
---
Same here. 3 clients take up a lot of CPU compared to what they took 6-9 months ago.
---
One probe character, BM and send the alpha char there.
---
just because the other side decided to run away isnt  our problem o/

YONIS
---
lmao didn't see me B)
---
Dog bless
---
its really not 2:1 sir and idk why ur mad both sides have fun. No tidi titans dying full escalation , go be salty elsewhere also that guy is wrong yes its 4 titans to 5
---
what molok
---
yeah I filmed the whole thing
---
its 4 titans to 5 , advot is with us,
---
Wow wow...slow down there buckaroo! If you keep that spin up you may pull a neck muscle
---
fyi bots will quickly adapt to sitting in an asshouse on gate and using the "look outside" function so you can't even tell if they're doing this or stop it
---
TBH those are probably just alpha chars running on some VM as if not there is no reason to not use something with cloack.
---
they're also chinese
---
Imagine the notifcations during an Imperium moveop. No thanks.
---
Unfortunately since bots are tireless and can just farm up to 23 hours a day (or however long they can do so b4 being ganked and having to be reset manually, unless you are constantly multiple times a day hitting them for a week or more, they can make enough to make it worth their while and replace their losses.  If they do it with enough accounts they can make enough to plex their accounts in usually less than a week ( if they are even plexing their accounts.)
---
Lol
---
Virtue set for scanning means you can essentially brute force scan with a bot, and then there's the implants and modules for relics that can brute force relic sites,
---
Can't watch vid at work. But basically, if you fly in a flat line and hit orbit, it will be a flattish orbit. If you fly vertical to your tactical overlay, it will be vertical orbit.

"BLacKoUt HAs SToppEd ThE BotTers! YaAaAaaaaAaaY! .... oH....."

How would this keep the market "artificially afloat"? It was like 8 ships. Code ganks freighters with as much shit on them every other day or whatever. I get the banned months ago thing but I don't understand the market aspect. Markets seem fine to me.
---
/u/ccp_rise NPC null space in Drone Lands when?       
---
Like this is reason why drone lands are 'bot lands'.        
---
If adjusting something to NPC space is to hard - maybe place in some system like 2-3 NPC stations.                    
---
It is still better than current situation.
---
Given the Jump Freighter to covert change I wouldn't be surprised if Falcon's suggestion that supers can't be used in Lowsec holds true.
---
My C2 has been getting more wandering holes lately it seems and yesterday i actually had 2 c3 statics open at the same time! One was eol the oher wasn't, but both were 0477. Never seen that before.
---
I'm talking about ehp/s. That's true, rattle scale better. I'm just saying, as a multiboxing guy that started from nothing to tinker rattles, rattles were faster to fly and tank the sites.
---
Now I'm thinking leshaks might be able to clear sites faster and scale just as good. They require more effort to multibox than drone boats however
---
I wonder about the potential of using an slippery pete to constantly appear on Dscan and break their bots while not being able to be scanned down.
---
indeed, the number is highly inaccurate. it was about 3x that at 1.5tril. 1tril for snuffed+excessive batphones, slightly over 400bil for us.
---
it lasted about 3 hours. init/goons/ph/suffed all came on the same side along with some of the renter alliances like "skeleton crew" or whatever. I think the only group missing here was Tri? to make that "all of eve TM" complete
---
notables, snuffed alliance head down (mentioned by OP)
---
snuffed head fc down
---
etc etc etc

deadco, again, amazing job, didn't say a single word in local other than "gf" really proud of you all. it was a huge fight.

GF. I was the only (?) hic in our DARK fleet, had great fun bubbling everyone til I got a bit carried away with Sort screaming to bubble titans and got out of range of logi. Recorded the whole thing as well, amazing fight and great FCing.
---
sounds like you should rework your recruitment standards
---
Faction fort came out of ref
---
Huge props to both sides for putting your big toys on the line and playing the game how it should be done.
---
Amarr ships are there for you brother.
---
Embrace the light.
---
Or burn in it.
---
Preferably all regions get an NPC constellation that can be reached by gate or carrier jump from another NPC constellation.
---
Bad ass!
---
Hi friend. Goons did not come to this fight. We didn't send any organized fleets. Some rando members might have showed up, but as an alliance, no one in leadership sent any fleets to participate. Please don't group us in with Snuff. It offends me.
---
the only reason for alliances to hold SOV should be access to supercap production.
---
Alpha clone myrms and scouts on gates? This is what we knew would happen lol. And it is now harder to report them due to no local?
---
Always the nearest enemy that's giving you aggression. They take a 25% damage reduction over their regular versions -- which is why people say they're garbage. The do, however, apply equally as well as T1/Navy missiles.
---
They have niche uses in PVE, little to none in pvp unless for some reason you dont want to lock your enemy in a 1 on 1.
---
The 4 Snuff titans that died were worth as much as the 5 GotG ones. Who needs refits?
---
Uhhh, your math is off somewhere...
---
You greatly underestimate the length of time it takes to develop changes to a system like that. They could use a random number between 1 and 100 to determine when to press "F" and now they can't be tracked. If it takes a guy 8 hours to rewrite a part of the script so that their 50 bots can keep making ISK that time is easily worth it.
---
People need to stop underestimating the lengths botters will go to. It doesn't matter **what** changes CCP introduces...botters will find a way around it. It's silly and stupid to keep designing game elements in any hope of trying to eliminate them or make their lives harder.
---
There’s people streaming all the gates around detorid etc, if you want to bore yourself to death and kill bots, then just log off in system at a safe away from celestials. I haven’t seen any using 64au combat probes to watch for logins yet, but I’m guessing that’s in the works.
---
In nullsec, the final timer has a minimum duration of 60 hours. It will come out on the day and time you have specified. If the next instance of that day and time is 60 hours or more away, it will happen at that next instance. If it is less than 60 hours away, it will happen the following instance. 
---
Highsec is 5.5 days, rather than 60 hours. Wormholes are 0.5 days
---
Ask me anything?
---
Well...
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Can CCP even detect that stuff?
---
Soo... Snuffed Out was snuffed out?
---
&gt; not worth to be a sov holder 
---
build supers? that's what sov is for
---
Yours fucking stupid gtfo of here
---
Epic fun. GF. Pretty much a draw on losses anyway wasn't? We could have given Snuff a massive bloody nose but 3-4 warped out in low armour. Credit to the snuff &amp; init subcap fleets for the saves.
---
Got to DD things. Titan ownership validated.
---
\-Darkness guy
---
Im all for whatever folks can do, im just concerned about burnout for yall.
---
People talk trash about one of the best ships in the game? Weird.
---
Lets go with **Weekly reminder killing bots doesn't solve the botting problem**
---
Because dropping them isn't the problem keeping them after there anchored is the problem. 
---
The reason small groups don't have them is because about a month later the GSF or PL or FRT fleet shows up to pop one.
---
I'd like to know more about the reasoning behind not reimbursing AT ships that were lost to server faults despite logs actually showing this
---
Mine died legitimately but I am more thinking about that Imp in highsec among others
---
that right monitor hanging of the edge makes me nervous...
---
6 * 9  = ?
---
What was the most bizarre ticket you had to deal with?
---
Yondu literally begged all lowsec groups to come defend them soooo yeah. Not really dhsjs problem
---
i mean, ccp could make much more interesting and engaging pve.  but that would require putting money into eve, something they've been unwilling to do for five years or more.  so instead they're going to see what switches can be flipped with an hour of junior dev time and stick to that.
---
Yeah but it's not trivial to do and obviously takes a bit of time to gather it.
---
Team Security is understaffed
---
Time to break out the spreadsheets and get to work. Can't have everything for free.
---
What to do with said supers after cyno change?
---
Is it difficult to know when the "Report Bots" bin needs to be emptied, considering they aren't paid attention to?
---
They are indeed.
---
They're using virtue set pods for this? I'm sure that's worth hunting for some people. You can just cloak a Sabre in a relic site the next system over and wait for the bot to come to you.
---
The only part I'm having trouble believing is the probing. That's a *really* advanced bot if it can move probes around and scan down sites through the probe interface.
---
Just perma camp them in a t3.
---
Go on GOTG! 😂 never thought i’d cheer you on but glad you’ve grown some balls
---
It's 2:1, just own it my bro. Data is data. I get you're trying to not count the losses of all the folks you bat phoned for all these timers. Doesn't work that way. I'm not the one (nor were any of my guys) who spent hours sh*t talking and making personal remarks in local my friend. maybe encourage folks dial it back a bit next time. I certainly do with my members, as you saw tonight. Glad you had fun, I certainly did, you lost a 100bil titan, take the loss and move on. but as I said, it'd be far far more "fun" for everyone if your guys weren't so toxic in local.

No need to plex an account of they are using myrms.

Keep telling this to yourself. But just look at our sov map then look at the coalition map and then look who got nips and shit with eachother. And you realy think that more groups will help? Just look at PIBC that came from serenity first thing: Blue someone, wow.

---
its not 2:1 lol whatever dude , even gotg guys are saying its not , you still won by like a 100b but its almost 50 50 so yea.... youre clearly not a bright one.
---
When highlighting bots, should we bother compiling evidence or just throw the names at you lot and let you determine it?
---
Another adaptation I have seen is scout pods tethered to a nearby Astrahus some 1200km from a gate
---
Do you guys forward feedback to the dev team at all?
---
Are the GMs facilitating the "era of Chaos" in any way?
---
highly inaccurate.
---
still does not change the fact that Theran is absolute trash
---
what about afk players?
---
Make a bot that jumps back and forth into the system to force the bots to warp off, modern problems, modern solutions!
---
Theran alliance, ladies and gentlemen. I don't know why Darkness gives these guys space.
---
Do you guys have internal messages they go out any time there's a massive server problem/issue and/or event that causes a big impact on the player base? 
---
Something like: "Alright guys, servers went down for a few hours due to database issues, so expect tickets about this"
---
abyssal space was a decent effort that's fair
---
the lack of any change to mining since, uh, 2004?, not so much
---
Kill the rundll.exe spawned by Eve. That returns CPU usage to normal and doesn't crash anything, so no idea what it's doing other than using up resources.
---
This doesn't mean that blackout is a failure, it's just increased the complexity of the botting script, the barrier to entry (low because of alpha) and the opportunity cost of having to spend a significantly greater amount of time docked up.
---
&gt;Like last time, any topic is on the table
---
Why does CCP hate there homosexual player base?
---
Now let me explain this: 
---
So when we had a player how said the n word running for CSM this was completely unacceptable and couldn't represent the community the scale of time was not seen as a valid argument fine, so we had a other person running for CSM that went around calling people fags in interviews and CCP went you look like a fine community representative, the only answer i can come up with is that the secondary position reflex the opinion of CCP.
---
Could God mircrowave a burrito so hot that he, himself, could not eat it?
---
I agree when it comes to astras, but for the more expensive ones I think they should still have a timer. 
---
Fort would have 1 24H timer and the keep would drop to a 24H and a 2-4 Day one. I feel like this is a good middle ground between what we have now, and full retard “no asset safety no timers”. Also low power = no asset safety. Fights would definitely happen then
---
And why does that matter.
---
What's the deal with the no feedback policy on reports (bugs and bots)? 
---
The other day a GM contacted me on a new alt I made to check out the NPE asking if I need help with anything. I thought that was pretty cool, what's the general feedback about it from new players? Do they generally accept the help? What do they typically ask about?
---
Oh look, they’re not responding here either 🤯
---
likewise mate )
---
Best way to kill botting is to add fun. Bots cannot have fun. I think...
---
&gt; the number is highly inaccurate
---
and so are yours.. 
---
were on reddit here.. you dont have to spin your numbers just like your pings/sota's to your members.
---
You pick one, armor or Shield, you don’t do both
---
I appreciate your reply! 
---
But, I tried that just now, and it didn't change the plane of orbit for me at all. I keep getting the same path of orbit no matter which direction I initiate orbit. I've tried warping in at different angles relative to the object I'm testing against as well, and it doesn't change either. I know I'm missing something...
---
Even better is they now have a hull to attach to the name, so they could start doing things like ignoring a pod so they don't warp off needlessly
---
The framework for a more advanced border control bot has been laid. 
---
Cloaked ships off gates can watch for entries into a block of space and tag toon/hull to prioritize intel and distinguish gangs that have the ability to light a cyno due to having a hull that can fit one from ones that can't hotdrop on your space. Rorq bots are gonna love this one. No need to emergency warp if you know the gang nearby can't light a cyno.
---
I honestly don't think in this game that would ever be possible. When the game is mostly played like a webbrowser game for clicking targets and manageing distances a bot would almost always react better then a player.  Thats most likely why its so hard to spot a bot vs real players if there play times were the same
---
Main issue for PVP is they got after whatever is closest that is aggressive towards you. This means ships and drones. 
---
However when used in mass, the surprise alpha damage can actually take out enemies before they even realize they are the target. Just be sure to not trigger friendly fire.
---
I buy a lot of cheap stuff off public contracts, so I routinely encounter RMT firesales, where a hacker cracks an account, firesells all its assets and then RMTs the isk. I usually feel pretty bad when I get one of these, first because I don't wanna be involved in any capacity, but second because if the guy gets his accounts back, there's often not a lot I can do to help him. This is because even if I'm on record offering to help return the assets, the GMs in charge of the case don't refund *the isk the hacker got for the items*. 
---
This means I can't give the guy's stuff back unless I want to eat the full loss myself; the best I can do is give back whatever portion won't leave me losing isk (the profit margin on the deal) and sell the rest. (I.e. if I pay 5b for his stuff and sell it for 10b, I can give him 5b in isk or assets, and he loses the other 5.) 
---
In 2 hack cases (out of a much larger number) GMs have contacted me and asked me to contract the assets back to the original owner, then credited my wallet for the price of the contracts. This seems like an excellent way to handle hack refunds (since neither player loses money, and the owner gets his stuff back). But in other cases where I've offered to do the same thing, there's been no followup. 
---
So my question is: how do you determine in which hack cases you help the victim get his stuff back? Is there a process, and could it be systematized? Most people who do public-contracts trading would be down for helping hack victims out, and I'd be really happy to do this on *every* hack case instead of just a rare handful.
---
I didn't jump my titans in until the end with only a few hostile titans left on grid, and have to say, but I don't think I felt TIDI at all.
---
Bugs are not handled by the GM team. There is another team that deals with those.
---
CCP just ban all those bots plz. get rid of em

 I see more and more newbros wanting to go into wormholes after just few days or weeks, so I tried to make a flowchart for a critical point to stay alive, scouting.
---
The more you know about the system where you want to farm, the safer you are for making your ISK. I suggest you use this flowchart to every adjacent wormhole system and avoid any combat anomaly farming if there are threats.
---
People can move, new wormholes can spawn, so you are never totally safe, you need to spam D-Scan as much as possible and keeping and eye on new signature all the time to ensure the safety of your ship.
---
The closer you are from Amarr or Jita, the more likely you will meet other players (=threats).

The tools you need:

When I open that screen, I can see all the info immediately; current skill levels, skill queue etc. But then I get the small loading wheel on my character model, and that's when the CPU spikes and everything freezes for 2 seconds or so.  Every single time.
---
When I collapse the top bar of the character sheet (hiding the model), it no longer spikes the CPU - so definitely connected to loading the model (or maybe pulling up the net worth?).
---
You can safely probe off a structure. They could just warp in the thing that does the hacking/rolling of WHs.
---
Oh look, it says in the post they'll give it an hour then answer!
---
&gt;  which is what leads me to think the pods keep tracks of if there are still people in system in someway
---
Assuming the bot is reading the character name from the overview, another bot at some L4 locator agent could be querying automatically. Though I would say Jesus H Christ, what the hell get a job, if they are.
---
The only useful bot I've ever seen was one that spidered Met-Art.  According to a friend...

You can't change the **Inclination** because it's a deterministic function of your shipID and the current simulation time.

and that is a behavior better suited for bots than active players given its so damn boring.
---
best way to kill bot's is to stop fucking the real players over and develop an in house anticheat or adapt an off the shelf anti cheat, there will never be a perfect solutions its always going to be an ongoing thing, but hurting real players in the hope to stop bottings is like the literal definition of insanity.
---
Anything a player can do or come up with in terms of ratting meta, or mining meta, bots can do the exact same only better, because they dont need to blink, take breaks, they dont get bored, or hungry or need to take a piss..
---
ccp needs to stop screwing their players over, and stop taking the easy option and code their own anti cheat , an out of game solution is the only solution that does the job and does not screw us over.

What kind of ticks do those give then?  I suspect it's stupidly low, so you need dozens of them to make a reasonable amount of ISK.
---
How many times was I wrongfully reported for exploits regarding the Bloodraider diamond rats in NPC Delve?
---
The way I heard it described they're botting Asteros that wander around nullsec or lowsec running relic sites.
---
I think it should be for all structures. If an alliance fucks up bad enough to not fuel a structure it should pose a Huge risk. 
---
Huge stakes like that are what cause big fights. Accidentally losing your home or staging system due to mistakes or laziness is a classic part of EVE that is missing now with citadels.

As far as the "keeping track of people in system some way" part, I'd also not be surprised if they're taking advantage of Gate Jump data made available from the API or just scraping Dotlan to keep track of jumps into their system versus jumps into neighboring systems to keep rough track of possible people in-system via jump statistic discrepancies. Especially easy in dead-end or pipeline systems tbh.
---
Yea, character sheet completely saturates all cores for some bizarre reason.  I'm guessing there's a naughty mutex or spinlock lurkey somewhere in the code.

What I'm thinking though was that for poses at least, if you fucked up (or through malicious action) it got unfueled or unstronted you could still emergency form and try to rep it for a bit.   
---
With citadels you could then get some spy to unfuel it, then pop it within 30 min. with the defender not being able to do anything short of defeating your force, outright. I don't know what's better.   
---
But I also have this feeling that, if you're a part of an alliance that can afford a keepstar, then that's that - you need to keep security on it and make sure it doesn't run out of juice.

Secondary question: how many of those reports seem to have no basis from what you can see, and a probably someone not understanding what bottling is/ just being salty.
---
I have a question, not meant to troll or offend, just curious. How does a lowsec alliance like snuff SRP these titans?
---
I'm not sure if it's your price or skill range, what about a HAC or T3C? Something like an Ishtar or a Drone Proteus (with a set of light and medium drones to catch those fast frigates). You could also try using Command Ships that can act as both fleet booster and anti-frigate.

No, you just get the limited engagement timer so you're safe from other players except gankers.

More than 3 botting regions died after Blackout
---
As long as asset safety stays, I'm fine with the spy scenario. Trust and Spy Vs Spy is also a classic part of EVE. Spies have stolen corporations, toppled entire regions, and caused a ton of conflict.
---
You need to have the corporation roles to anchor a citadel, but no skill requirement.
---
At any given time, your fleet doesn't have enough interdictors.
---
It's one of the constants of EVE
---
Seems they may be on a rebound.

WH spawns directly linked to higher rats killed? Interesting idea

To add to the ship choices, an orca is also a great hauling ship, essentially the tankiest ship you can fly in hisec.

---
Proteus? Then no threat detected.
---
Adapt or die?
---
So in the end real players lose and ccp wins as now bots need more accounts.
---
Warping onto celestials? Good way to get popped.
---
On one hand I'd love CCP to get an Anti-Cheat. On the other hand, I like my boot.ini
---
It's still more effort for botters to get less safety. This is much easier to beat than local intel. I get that people who thought that the intention of blackout was to _eliminate_ botting are pissed, but it has made botting substantially harder.
---
I’m cool with these bots. I’m autistic enough to sit there and kill them for hrs. Let the games begin.
---
Ok, then the only way to do something like that is manual piloting. Bummer.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Don't be surprised if, in 6 months, CCP has eliminated every conceivable way to generate isk outside of wormholes.
---
Its not a money thing is a building thing. How do they get replacements?
---
Most people have a favorite hull in EVE, mine is a tie between the Marshal and Redeemer, what is yours?
---
Thats a lot of data to back up the shit your talking
---
Sounds like an improvement, at least. They need vastly more accounts, and have counters (as you've been farming them a bit or causing them to dock for long stretches of time). I imagine someone who would like to farm these longer term could probably log stuff off in system, good luck to any script trying to keep track of that let alone predict when said character is logged in again.

How many AT ships have been replaced in the history of the game?

Why don't you guys stay off this cesspool and get back to work on making the game better?

Thanks for the work you do.

&gt;angely movies stop playing for me - or should i say video playback freezes like it was paused - but sound is still playing and moving window with the video restarts the video output to normal.
---
i dont get these sort of issues at all. could be very well something with how the rest of the machine or chrome is configured aswell. Hardware acelleration off on everything: discord/chrome, addblock origin and stuff. nothing on the chrome department doing any problemds for me while eve. its just the cpu load that bugs me
---
Ok just remove the damage cap on them... then I think itll be looking good...
---
The blackout wasn't to stop botting, the blackout was meant to make null sec less safe than high and low sec space. Nobody cares that you can't rat mindlessly and generate passive wealth while watching Netflix.

This many caps shouldn't be able to fit in a single image.

Obviously OP.

On the other hand, it's impossible to account for wormholes and people logging off. Especially the latter makes it seem pretty easy to hunt them, i think.

Why was the GM event yesterday for such a short time in such an odd timeslot?

If you knew, you wouldn't ask. If you don't know for real. Then you don't know much.

We told him before :)
---
good chart my dude - I would add - warp at 50/70 from celestials, do a safe while you warp, check for probes on dscan, check nr of anoms/sigs - low nr means  activity. 
---
use pathfinder, it s easier than tripwire imo and gives you all the info.

google pathfinder mapper eve and go there

Are there things you don't have access to ?

High Class = Capital ship can go through wormholes
---
Low class = they cannot
---
For fun is the overall reason I think.
---
What is the go to method for determining if a player is botting after someone reports them? Also is there an internal team within CCP that searches out botters independent of player reports? I’ve always been interested in how you prove guilt.
---
50% of the isk/hr is still efficient if you can run it without having to buy plex, the cost to replace is low, and you can run 23/7, though.
---
Do you know what a "bat phone" is? Only our coalition showed up. We didn't call Test, we didn't call Goons, we didn't call Brave, we didn't call whoever. A single coalition showing up for a coalition timer isn't a "bat phone" my bro. Nullsec 101. the BR sides are accurate. everyone who wasn't our coalition wasn't there with us. They were against us.
---
Nice one Snuff... Shield hardeners on ARMOR titans lmao
---
whoosh boris misses the point, for shame boris for shame.
---
are you using some tools to automate restitution, contract rollback etc? or do you manually work the database there?
---
It's not cost in these kinds of fights, it's survivability. Recons getting popped mid jump = supers/caps ending up in the sun. It means poor warpins due to nothing having bubble immunity, possibility getting blapped off field before it has a chance of bringing in a ship to light a hard cyno (which wouldn't be possible). Whoever has grid first will be nearly impossible to drop on unless they choose to let you to, especially in nullsec with bubbles.
---
I hope no, when i was carrier ratting i was pressing "Shoot" or "orbit" 5 times per second..
---
Aside from the regular isk farming bots in Eve. Have you ever had to deal with other types of bots like ganking bots or scanning bots? Has anyone reported such a thing before?
---
But players can solve botting? /s
---
You mean Microsoft Excel right?
---
FTFY : Nobody cares that you can't rat mindlessly and generate passive wealth \[ PI, Market Trading, Lazy Hauling\] while watching Netflix.

Also, undock a domi, warp to site, do your point go watch netflix.

you cannot - maintaining a personalized orbit is manual piloting. There is a tech/ux reason for it - basically it requires every moving object to have its own orbit so it doesnt bump.

This could work, but it's a far cry from a "good" way. Ellatha, writing chain on paper, nothing about dropping safes?

What's your opinion about pineapple in pizza?

That is 1. not the issue and 2. not the solution.  What is it with that brute force thinking of some people.  like about half a year ago i for the "lols" were messing around with some old hardware that i had in my shelf for years to see if it can still do stuff. An old core2quad and it was running 2-3 eve clients without any issues at all. A cpu that was like 13? years old?   And half year later (wich btw never happened like this before) my i5 is suddenly barely able to handle 2 clients anymore?  sry but there are people out there who dont just buy something new if something gets messed up.

Few questions from me:
---
1. Why are faction auto-targeting missiles not available in LP stores?
---
2. I saw that code for mooring was available in a GM Menu on the 14th patch "sm.GetService('michelle').GetRemotePark().CmdMooreShip", would you care to elaborate what this feature would entail? (If you are willing to answer questions on code then I have a few more)
---
3. Why is the Legion the only T3 with an EWAR sub without a range bonus? The other T3 ships can used as a more combat orientated recon except the Legion which fails in comparison to the Curse EWAR and is forced into a brawling playstyle.
---
4. Signature radius application on capital reps like XL neuts to prevent FAXes dominating subcap fights as hard?
---
5. What's it like working at CCP Games as a developer? (It has peaked my interest several times to apply)
---
6. Favorite meme ship fit?
---
Somebody got bampersand
---
Dual tanking is a legit strat. Resists on something with 3-500k shield means you take more dd's
---
You should report bugs using the actual bug report functionality. GMs don’t handle bugs :)
---
lol. Wow, the cyno nerf has not hit yet and you already *need more* because it will still be too hard for you to get easy kills in sov space.
---
You clearly don’t know your game mechanics. Anything with a jump drive will land at cyno location as long as they hit jump before the cyno dies. Only bridges ships will land at sun.
---
This is a tough question - but not because there aren't bizarre tickets! There are tons of those :) 
---
It's funny in a way but as soon as you get this question, your mind draws a blank...
---
I can think of one right now that perplexed me a great deal. I'm cheating a bit in answering the question because I didn't actually personally handle this ticket. It was shown to me by a colleague.
---
So a few years back we got a ticket from a person who claimed to be working in an actual RMT sweatshop. Like, an actual physical location where he and many others did their "work", with a boss and paychecks and all that.
---
So, this person was apparently disgruntled with his employer to a point where they wanted to mess things up, so he gave us a long list of accounts used by that particular operation, along with a bunch of intel about how they ran things. The information checked out, this was a real report.
---
The person in question even had a legitimate EVE account on the side. Maybe that influenced his decision to send us the report? But in any case, this  ticket really surprised me in a good way and I thought it was a pretty bizarre report. He got to keep his real legit EVE account by the way.
---
I'll reply again if I can think of any more good ones!

&lt;3 cap, voice of reason lol
---
Plex has dropped a good bit in price since blackout came on, so the value of isk has gone up. That is a net good for real players. 
---
The fact that bots need more accounts to do the same job as before and also have to stay docked up for a far greater amount of time and are significantly easier to catch and kill is also good for real players.
---
I do too, but I so.ehow lost my pair of em
---
COSMOS Missions, every one is like a Storyline quality.
---
Can confirm we saw this exact same behavior in Fade last night from Gemini Whale United another well known botting corp. Capsules on the gates as eyes with Myrms in groups running sites. Only reason we were able to catch one of the myrms is we had a bomber cloaky camping the system for some time with scram.  [http://zkillboard.com/kill/78528466/](http://zkillboard.com/kill/78528466/)
---
No, not really. Even if you do not get into capitals bastion modes draw backs plus the price tag make them a pretty stupid ship to use for anything other than gimmick youtube video pvp.
---
Why did you decide to do full amnesty for the drone exploit of 2014. That was the most fun I ever had in the game. Would do it again )))
---
double tank is actually viable in all out titan battle, you can soak alot more DD's
---
We don't get that many Cosmos mission tickets today. We used to get a LOT of them, but now they're fairly rare compared to before.
---
I just did a quick search of our ticket system for tickets submitted in 2019 including the word "Cosmos" and it returns 124 tickets total - so we currently get about 1 ticket every two days or thereabouts.
---
Why is it less than before? Off the top of my head my guess is that there are two main factors:
---
1. Some Cosmos related defects have been fixed. For example there was one particular Cosmos mission we heard about ALL the time. It was one of the "King of the Hill" missions (don't remember which part), that had an issue which was addressed.
---
2. There are better player resources today for Cosmos missions than before.
---
**About what I think will happen first - Cosmos missions removed or fixed.**
---
I'm sure they will be fixed rather than removed. That's just my guess, don't take this as a promise of any sort - that's not my promise to make!
---
But yeah, the Cosmos missions are essentially pretty good content in a terrible system. They were created before their time in a sense, long before we had epic arcs and such, and there are issues with handling these types of multi-agent chains within the basic mission system.
---
It would be a shame to remove good content instead of fixing it IMO.
---
In your own words, their passively generating wealth, as for the amounts, I dunno about you can get some insane PI seups that generate billions per month, and some would argue that the Isk they make from sitting in a station 100% immune from death can dwarf what any ratter makes. so Yeah. I guess I am.
---
Perfect intel is a myth, and even with your idea of Perfect intel shit still died, ratters still got caught, even bot's still got caught, arguably more so than now, because unlike a human and as the OP said and as I an many others explained many many times, the bots will sit eyes on gates and have 100% intel on people coming and going, and trigger their warp outs etc accordingly.
---
Hell I would argue that bot's are safer now than players are. not as safe as with intel sure. but still safer now than players
---
Yeah, blops really aren't worth using, even with the blackout meta. Unless of course you are super rich and have lots of iskies to throw away.
---
agreed this is still an upgrade as cloaky camping or log off tricks actually work now whereas before they would warp off while you were still loading in.

Is the fit shit?

what are the plans if eve breaks?

Mission running?

Neat !
---
I could name half a dozen shooters and several other mmos which combat bots rather effectively bit then you will just say they dont compare and how hard it is. Honestly, you would think on the community of gaming developers they would be able to reach out to someone to ask for help.
---
It certainly ain't lit.
---
Thank you for your advice! We just moved into WH space and nestor seemed to be our only logis available in the hangers. Although we were not given many options, nestor was definitely an arguable choice. Now we are considering oneiros for home defense as we live in a cataclysmic hole. Other than that we need to work a lot more on our fleet comps and bring boosts bhaalgorns and maybe scorpions to the next party.

PI takes a lot of work, and you have to risk your assets getting them to market. And as far as station trading, it has its own risks that come with doing that. Stop being salty because you can't drive the cost of Plex up anymore.

Golly...if only I'd directly addressed this....
---
&gt;To live next to a bloc, you're going to have to blue a bloc. But the people on the other side of you don't.
---
I'd wager bots don't use the probe interface you're accustomed to but instead send commands directly to the server. From there its just a matter of basic geometry.
---
I saw these guys multiple times while roaming in cache but I was afraid to engage solo a blob of drones. 
---
Now I’ll definitely try ;))))

where do i find the rundll.exe because at least it looks like there is none in task manager?

It was a recent upgrade for me. Even with the 32 bit client, my 4-5 active accounts would lag out. Now they never do

"ur" isn't specifically an abbreviation of either "you are" or "your", my interpretation is that it can be both. In which case it's up to the reader to discern for himself whichever variant is grammatically correct, so in a way it is you who offended the reddit gods of grammar, *with your mind.*
---
I hate to break it to you but volatile skins existed way before the PA acquisition. I'm glad you're just now finding them though.
---
Love to see them make a brief comeback.
---
Fuck off its cute
---
I hope you are talking about the *programming* being harder, because programming a bot to care about how difficult their job is would be a weird design choice indeed.
---
Also it's not that hard. A couple of weeks of development time and the bots are back in business. Using workarounds that are so obvious we have literally been talking about them in "remove local" threads for years.

No, it was the armor timer

so on first glance things defnetly look better on the 32bit client by far. lets see if it stays that way during a session or starts to tank over time. But it way lower to begin with [https://i.imgur.com/vmiMjKx.png](https://i.imgur.com/vmiMjKx.png)

Hey BadRandolf. When the GM contacted you on a rookie character, that was our Meet and Greet program. A program we've been running on and off for a number of years with volunteers or paid staff. Around the start of this year we increased our MnG efforts and our goal is to greet as many new players as possible to help them navigate the learning curve a bit. The greeted players usually love it! I don't know of any other games that have this sort of thing. I don't know off hand how many people accept the help but it's a fair number. The most frequent questions are usually related to the content the player is working through at the time we get to them. 
---
A lot of people also tell us that they were brought into the game by a friend and that friend is helping them through the first couple of days which is awesome. Do even more of that! :)
---
I would say just fit a few drakes, caracals and maybe a torp raven (with mwd for mobility) for fleet pvp (buffer tank, ab, tackle) get a couple of ab ospreys and just go in and start ratting. 
---
if pvp happens, roll with it - people won t expect pvp fits/readiness and you don t lose much if you get wiped. 
---
After you ve run a few c4 sites you would have already paid for the fleet so you can go rat in peace and have your pvp fun.
---
Can’t you just shut down the systems by merely being there?  Why not take a page from the cloaks camper playbook and let them know you’re always in system?
---
How should we handle bots where we have repeatedly reported them but they still fly out to their belts and run 23 hours a day in NPC corps?

Do you still play, V0kan? Or are you (also) too busy playing Starsector?

&gt;the bots are adapting to the black out by placing pods on all entrance to their botting system
---
I'm shocked and amazed and totally didn't predict this the second blackout started.
---
Fuck you. Punctuation makes sentences readable, in any language.
---
I laughed my ass off when I saw that! I thought the sass was really hilarious to be honest!
---
But to expand on this topic a bit:
---
While we haven't posted an official declaration that this an exploit, but killboard bombing on this scale is certainly frowned upon. We had heard of some instances of killboard bombing on a small scale which we let slide - emergent gameplay and all that. 
---
Recently though, a player started offering a service where thousands of ships would be smartbombed simultaneously:
---
 [https://forums.eveonline.com/t/static-to-killboard/175674/](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/static-to-killboard/175674/)
---
That service was taking things a little too far so we shut it down. Smartbombing a massive amount of ships in this manner was creating a ton of load on our killmail generation node and that was really the main issue we had with what was going on.
---
To be honest with you, I didn't think it was necessary to publish an exploit declaration - making mountains out of molehills and all that. The service was shut down and hopefully that's the end of this. Generally we try to avoid public exploit declarations unless it's necessary - i.e. if it is being abused on a large scale. Hope that makes sense.
---
&gt;best way to kill bot's is to stop fucking the real players over and develop an in house anticheat or adapt an off the shelf anti cheat
---
You realize this isn't actually possible, right?
---
I mean. You have to kill everything. But with a Carrier you do that stupifast.
---
Had an absolute blast at this fight. One of our spy's noticed the timer a few days ago so we decided to stage bombers in the system the night before to join in on the fun. Fights like this are why we play EVE. Had a great time see y'all at the next one :D
---
Look at any online game. Bots are everywhere. Any form of activity that is cumbersome and time consuming for a human will be automated. Recent and upcoming changes are making it harder for players to make isk. That means more demand for bots. Supply and demand. You seem upset so I would say that I hate bots as much as anyone, but I am not naive to think that a change like the blackout would wipe them out and it actually may have an opposite effect long term.
---
market trading is by far the best way to make money in this game. wormholes are better than nullsec, l5 missions in lowsec are better. nullsec ratting isnt really that great once you explore the game a bit lol
---
It's a product of TIDI and cynos dying where supers/caps will load system away from where the cyno is, maybe not in the sun specifically, but I've experienced it enough that it's a concern, especially with lower tanked cynos and the absolute need it creates for everyone to spam jump the second they see the cyno before it dies.
---
Spanish has punctuation does it not?
---
Where would one go to hunt these botters?
---
Lol that edit is proof you are salty as fuck perhaps next time you travel through lowsec and see a bunch of nerds you don't warp straight to the gate?
---
It was nice to know you guys.
---
Last time I traveled to laki (2 weeks ago), on the road 206 between the hringveggur and before it becomes F206, there is a farm on the right. On this farm there were some pile of haystack with plastic on it close to the road. On the plastic it was draw in black the silly finger and on the next  one CCP.
---
What did CCP does to this brave farmer? :p A story to tell?

We laughed hard with my wife saying that probably this man didnt like the blackout.

---
I and many others within my circle of space friends have experienced a tendency of dealing with the chinese community with kiddy gloves, and giving warnings &amp; other punishment for infractions that are barely even considered to be more than general banter.  
---
Any word as to whether this is true and as to if it is possible to revert a GM's decision after the fact since it has impact on the person in the future (I got denied CSM candicacy cause I said something stupid to a chinese player, which was then reported as hate speech).
---
Guy submits a ticket where he found a shuttle with thousands of plex in it. He starts linking Wikipedia articles for IRL Maritime Salvage Laws in International waters, trying to justify the fact that he should keep the plex.   
---
That day I learned a lot about Maritime Law.
---
So what you're saying is, unlike under the prior system with local where provided you were in local they permanently stay docked and eventually switch systems, all I need to do to farm a couple myrmidon kills is leave my [curse/cloaky anything/whatever other ship since they don't watch dscan] in system for 2 hours while I go eat dinner or do something else, and then I get a bunch of kills?
---
Sounds like a pretty good improvement over the prior system if you ask me.
---
Who could have forseen this?!?
---
Roaming post blackout has been even worse than before.
---
Less players ratting/mining for even less content.
---
Bots still full force!
---
Well done CCP. Glad my one account went alpha when blackout hit and my other two lapsed alpha yesterday. Will just ghost train them until they do something about the real issue: the bots.
---
Is reddit trolling me, do people realize how slow a capital ship warps from origin TO the anomaly?
---
Maybe it's time to write our own bots which just jump around all day.

---
Hi, Senior GM Aisling here :) 
---
Hacked accounts, RMT and stuff is my thing, so I'll try to answer it as detailed as I can. 
---
First thing you need to know about the hack cases is that they all are very-very different and can be rather unique, even if it does not seem like it from someone's point of view. This is exactly why in some cases GMs might have asked you to contract assets back and in some cases it was simply not possible due to different circumstances. I know that it is very hard to tell the difference and all these cases might seem the same if someone is not dealing with them on a daily basis. 
---
We do our best to help the victim get the stuff back. There are MANY factors involved in this decision, trust me on this, sometimes we even have to deny it due to the certain circumstances of the specific case. The process is systematized, at least internally, but due to the fact that we cannot reveal much during the investigation, it has to stay behind the scenes, if it makes sense. You'd be surprised, but it also changes every now and then. Our tools improve, we get new gadgets to work with, we try to make it easier for the players themselves and this is a never-ending process of certain modifications. We exchange experience with each other, share ideas, trying to simplify certain things (for you guys first of all). 
---
I like your idea though. While I can't promise that it will be implemented very-very soon, this is something up for discussion definitely.
---
I kid you not, I could go for some Buckfast right about now!
---
Forgive the salt but recently a well respected 03 player I know was given a temp ban for macro use. I know 100% that he is innocent because I physically seen him on his computer with my IRL eyes. Do you look up any background information on potential botters? Have you seen many players from the damn beta botting these days?

ahahahaa Jesse's salt is tooooo much. Wonder if he will ever learn, probably not though.

There is no rule to not reimburse AT ships specifically. If we can verify that there was a server issue involved, then the ship can be reimbursed. If you are asking about a specific loss, then unfortunately I cannot provide you with any information, as if there is a case like that, it would be between us and the player in question.

i knew there are retards in gotg but please, tell me its not that bad.
---
&gt;  Then snuffed cyno's in Init Merc, Init associates, and a whole bunch of other alliances.
---
literally talking out of your ass. holy fuck youre stupid.
---
the init FC streamed how he traveled to o1y, there is a DIRECT thera wormhole to o1y where horde came from. but of course, everyone got cynod in by snuff..
---
I've flown plenty of blops before, and fc'd for them, what's obvious is anyone thinking they need to be stronger and also have covert cloaks are idiots who have no idea how to use them properly, anyone with half a brain can project power very well using a blops, and only fools go solo blopsing.
---
Not every Blops ship in a blops group all bridge at once, so yeah, plenty of blops can jump through, you just have to not be a scrub who can only bring 1 blops ship to a fleet, like, what blops fleet is like that, really.
---
What fight?
---
I suppose if you were just doing garrison's and only had 2 omega accounts to work with rattles are fine. But the moment you can scale higher then 2 and want to run all the sites, with drifter. Nestors are THE way to go.
---
The gate watchers don't need to be omega, so CCP isn't winning either.
---
Isn't Conoco that Jita scam corp
---
Imagine imagining
---
Absolutely! This is a big focus for CCP right now and I think it's well overdue.
---
Regarding CCP maintained resources, we used to have &amp; maintain a wiki which was never really as good as the material players create, so it was dropped. We've grudgingly admitted that we're just not as good at maintaining resources like this as our players.
---
Big props to EVE University and other wiki resources out there - GMs use your material on a daily basis. No joke! If something isn't clear in our internal documentation (which is fairly vast), then we often turn to the EVE uni wiki and google.
---
On the topic of new player accessibility, this morning I recorded a podcast with CCP Mimic and CCP Burger which we intend to post later this week (Thursday I believe). New player accessibility was a big discussion point and I think you may enjoy listening to that once we post it :)
---
I don't know when these ones were introduced but I've only seen four examples of these so far. One for each race. We may not be talking about the same kind here. However, I don't see how anybody as a consumer could be happy with this direction if they choose to pursue it further. The ever increasing monetisation is never a good thing for any game.
---
We don't actually work with bug reports, sorry.
---
Is it gay if you don't push back ?
---
We have an incredibly supportive team here. Personally I have not experienced this, however, compared to previous jobs Ive had this is THE best support I have ever had in any job.
---
You mean those pve injected semi-afkers? Dude, just quit while you still can.
---
Yes, mostly through our feedback to the game developers. Usually, we are also the first ones to notice when something goes wrong.
---
&gt; It's silly and stupid to keep designing game elements in any hope of trying to eliminate them or make their lives harder. 
---
What a dumb comment. Pod yourself.
---
This one was in Asia. Big surprise? :) But actually, we've seen botting &amp; RMT from probably every continent except Antarctica.
---
\[Citation Required\]
---
About the only thing CCP could currently use is excessive time logged in (a human's not going to be on 23/7).  But that's pretty easy for botters to solve since they're alpha accounts running Myrms.
---
 *Do not try and bend the spoon, that's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth...there is no spoon.*
---
I mean.... as a content creator, would you rather have people go directly to your channel or some other person's channel? He just took my content without permission and uploaded it to his personal Youtube. I would much rather him make the three highlights like he did, and then link directly to Twitch.
---
Also, do you really think I'd be salty over 20M in losses?  I even said on stream shortly after the first cut that it's all good fun. I blob all the time in wormhole space or against ratters. Blobbing is fun for the blobber but not the guy ganked while fair fights are fun for both.
---
Mess with POS code. Progress!
---
(I'm not a programmer though)
---
I've noticed the problem seems to be more frequent with the 64bit client than 32bit.
---
Up until the June 25 update I had no issues with 64bit and I could do lots of docking/undocking, gate jumping, be on grid with lots of ships...and not have a problem.
---
Now the moment I login and undock on our staging keepstar with a few caps+ on the undock my FPS plummets from 60 down to 20-30 and gets stuck there until I restart and I get 60 fps again. Also only able to currently dock/undock 2-3 times before needing to restart and about 5 gate jumps before I need to restart.
---
Switched back to 32bit, haven't had a single issue. Submitted a bug report about it, got told my computer sucks and bug report got closed pretty much instantly.
---
You need to warp on the citadelle to know if people are docked in them anyway.
---
still prefer it over the dumpster fire that is eve now
---
Does infinity have a number?
---
&gt; To live next to a bloc, you're going to have to blue a bloc. But the people on the other side of you don't. 
---
We saw how tapi directly said no right? You act like there was a point in eve where someone said "nah we have enough blues". As long as they will have a pulse to make the blue standing they will get it.
---
Fewer groups won't help but mroe won't either, as mentioned above they will just go and blue up.
---
First, captchas are incredibly annoying to humans.
---
Second, all of the funny-looking-text captchas have been broken.
---
Third, there are captcha services on the Internet that will solve them for you for very, very cheap using Chinese or Indian labor.
---
Spy?
---
The strawman here is unbelievable. No reasonable hunter wants responses to be impossible - they just don't want to have 50 angry nerds dropped on them any time they tackle *anything*
---
Fit a Cyno is one of the best EVE videos ever not just because it's hilarious, but because it so perfectly illustrates how ridiculous levels of safety can be achieved in 0.0 simply by putting a *single high slot module* on your ship.
---
And to reiterate my response to the goon/flair baiter above, show us on the doll where CCP touched your isk faucet.
---
Did he get to keep the PLEX?
---
If a recon lights a cyno, supers jump and it gets blapped then you potentially have the first few supers stuck on grid by themselves. That's risky so no people won't be doing that. You'd have to light it out of engagement range then try to move them closer if you want to avoid the risk of catastrophe. Which again like I said, gives a huge advantage to whoever claims that grid first with capitals. if it's going to be difficult for one side to escalate then it should be equally difficult for both sides.
---
My favorite ship Barghest PANCAKE FTW!!!
---
So if the guy killed the ships at a slower and more realistic speed it would then be fine?
---
Maybe from a fleet member perspective, but it's really not. The FC has to utilize his command destroyers to get to the perfect range, all while trying to line up that bombing run. I've always seen us use the more traditional method of bombing (by wing, from perches and from the FC probing) so this was a pretty refreshing thing to see our FC Seddow do.
---
I don't think you understand the word random.
---
Or idk track accounts on 23/7 never takibg a break each week?

no Snuffed just showed up for timers. The owner of the Faction Fort is a dweeb who likes shit talking anyone and everyone so eventually he pissed off the wrong people and had to call daddy Sort Dragon to come save him.

If you are worried about the faucet:sink ratio just make cut anom rat value by half an give out the rest as concord LP.

Nope, but i gave him a thank you for letting us know
---
Hello, Aisling here :) 
---
Do you mean in game per se or in the internal side of it? I mean... as always, we would LOVE to have more details in our logs. EVE is changing, our system is changing as well, we get new tools and such, but there can always be more :) I think each and every GM can answer this question differently, depending on what they have to face regularly. We all dream of certain features to be added. 
---
Personally I would love to see players start being more... honest with us, whenever they submit a ticket. We are not a soulless system, we are on your side, we are here to help whenever we only can &lt;3 So that's a good start, I think. Mutual trust can go a long way :)
---
Good question. We do occasionally get issues where we fear for someone's mental health and safety. We are not trained professionals and do not consider us to be qualified to handle such matters directly ourselves. So we have processes in place to escalate those cases to actual professionals. That is usually the police.
---
We are fortunate enough that our local police department has excellent understanding and we've worked with them to create processes where they work with the relevant authorities to get the individual the help they need as quick as possible. We have examples where people have gotten a wellness check within an hour of a concerned friend contacting us through a ticket and we know that we have saved lives.
---
I travel a lot through the inaccessible Icelandic Highlands. It's beautiful, quiet, solitary and peaceful. Keeps me sane ;)
---
God knows.

Thanks for the reply. You've always been one of my favorite GMs.

Does it make it any better?

I actually enjoy scanning and finding content. It’s not about less scanning, it’s about more content (as you said). You claim that reducing lifetimes to 8 hours would increase content, but fail to specify how it would. You also ignore that rolling holes is the primary method of finding a new chain and consequently content. Stable chains are necessary to find content and EOL holes are dead ends in them. With a lifetime of only 8 hours more holes will be EOL.
---
I think they'd be decent if aggro was determined by fleet. Maybe they need a simple drop-down menu for aggro self or fleet. Then it would just be about finding range for the primaries.
---
Can you explain how you do it then? Can be interesting if there is other ways.
---
Archduke here, from a GM committee handling offensive content reports.  
---
We don't do preferential treatment, favoritism or hate - whether you believe it or not. That being said, we usually only take action on matters that are reported through our support ticket system. So what I think may have happened here is that there are some circumstances involved in the first case you mentioned that are just not public (context matters a lot), or that the second case you mentioned wasn't reported to us.
---
And have you kill me when im ~~redacted~~?
---
Logi on killmails... When?
---
It's possible it has more to do with TIDI than the cyno dying. But if your only argument against my claim is that it doesn't apply to caps/supers and only applies to subcaps, then my point still stands that weak as fuck cynos = poor game experience when they get popped instantly.
---
Also, view from BjornBee rupture's fleet: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/469407892?t=02h41m19s

Today I posted this AAR after our fight with gotg, including the BR thanking the parties involved.

I came back from town to find my amazing post deleted, to make space for a „happening thread“ including only the titan and isk losses without any AAR.

---
Have you seen large RMT sweatshops in all continents?
---
So you’re saying there is still unexplored territory?
---
Btw, are there eve players in Antarctica?
---
Kk thanks for the time spent. Maybe you're right and just because I've been a developer for years I don't know what I'm talking about. Maybe I missed where every change CCP made to try and curb botting has done nothing. My B.
---
For reference: This topic is literally the result of people saying "it won't help", CCP doing it anyway, and people seeing it not helping. But you right, you right.
---
PVE in general needs to be overhauled. Its painfully 16 years out of date

As an avid Snuff hater, deleting that post is wrong.

&gt;We saw how tapi directly said no right?
---
Uh...you realize TEST is the bloc in this scenario, right?  Why, exactly, must TEST say no?
---
&gt;You act like there was a point in eve where someone said "nah we have enough blues"
---
No, distance makes there less of a reason to set someone blue.  For example, TEST isn't bothering to negotiate blue status with all the people land-rushing into Vale right now, 'cause they're across the map from us.
---
Find me in the Scavenger hunt and maybe you can get some SKINs
---
Ugh, no.
---
Hello :) 
---
Yes, yes and yes! And yes again. We have plenty of tools, but some work requires a lot of manual things and, well, human thinking, counting, certain investigations, that can not be done by machines (yet). For example, take investigating a serious exploit and a ship loss. 
---
GMs will use the same system for that, even similar tools. But the amount of manual investigation of those cases can hardly be compared.
---
YES PLEASE
---
Nay!

Grue, but to be fair SC lore isn't made to make everything badass and I'm fine if they just pull out the two best competitive RTS games.

We don't mess with DB directly (that's what DB admins do), but rather use intermediary tools that interact with it. We have tons of different tools for different roles. Some are old and clunky, some are new and fancy. 
---
Sometimes the issue at hand is so unusual that there are no tools for fixing it, so then we ask DBA to intervene. That's extremely rare though.
---
See, the problem with that is that GMs generally don't have much to begin with :D
---
We don't have much ISKs, we trash all the spare items after events and our inventories are usually quite empty, believe it or not :)
---
So there is not much to gain from this deal, tbh.
---
I guess it was part of RMT transaction, and guy that found it was a 3rd party?
---
Yeah but like the "coke adicted space american" human or the "mid 40 mom compensating for her terrible life choice with big ass vehicules" human ?
---
on one side you have a valid point, but on the other side there's "fuck snuff", really conflicted atm
---
This is not my area of expertise, botting is mostly handled by our friends at Team Security. 
---
From what I gather, it is in most cases enough to just get the character names. If all you really have is character names, it is best to use the in-game reporting tool to get the information to us, rather than a support ticket. Instructions on doing that can be found here:
---
[https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000249125-Reporting-suspected-bot-users](https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000249125-Reporting-suspected-bot-users) 
---
That being said, we have gotten detailed reports that have been really valuable to the team. It's hard to define useful information, but it will generally be something fairly juicy - something beyond "I see these guys in System X all the time". I'm thinking something more along the lines of "It's well known that corp A is a botting corp and they have approached my alliance often about renting space" etc.
---
If you have that kind of information, we encourage you to send us a ticket. The ticket will be forwarded by a GM to Team Security for handling.
---
Alternatively (and even better than a support ticket to be honest), you can send detailed reports of that kind to [security@ccpgames.com](mailto:security@ccpgames.com) \- the security team will even sometimes give PLEX rewards for particularly valuable reports!
---
NO
---
fuck pinapples
---
There are ways.
---
For example, what if ratting was changed to an incursion like environment, with the site being locked behind a gate and payout balanced to be for a 10 man fleet. The catch is that each room has a structure that generatates an infinite point on all ships within the room until it is cleared. Add a bunch of AF rats that need to be scrammed/webbed/painted in order to be applied onto so everyone has to fit a scram or web.
---
10 players in a fleet of say, a web loki/vindicator, a Damnation/vulture, 2-3 Guardian/Basi, and 6-7 brawling fit battleships can react to a gank squad by going to 0 on the acceleration gate exit and fight off the gankers. Bots however are fucked.
---
Then for extra "fun", make it so that each site will escalate to another site in the constellation, with the big payout at the final site. This requires taking gates with your fleet, putting in placed where it can get tackled. But since you are in an organized fleet with semi-PVP fits, the gankers are fightable until reinforcements arrive.
---
6*10=60, so then 60-6=54... Fifty four! Or was it a trick question? :D

Recently my girlfriend has offered to try eve after watching me play, it looks so complicated to her that she's curious about the new player experience, I'm going to sit with her and take notes - but not offer assistance outside what the game offers directly. Would these notes be of any use to you and if so where should I send them?
---
Not sure if you're being sarcastic here :)
---
I try my best with Thunderdome in general, Tournaments for the EVE World Tour, and player-run tournaments as well. It's not easy to live up to the legacy of our beloved Logibro, and I know these tournaments are not exactly what AT was. Still, we do try, even without the actual tournament tool, and I hope that some of you can enjoy these attempts at tournaments :)
---
What is the purpose of protecting "rookie" players in rookie systems. This seems like a needlessly complex rule that doesn't do anything to protect players and only confuses players. Most missions take rookie players out of the protected systems within hours so why even have these protections in the first place?
---
Too bad they can form a voltron..

 That woupd be epic 5 titans and 2 supers merge to make voltron

More detail in the logs.

Players - I would like to see less toxicity in chat to be honest. Racism, hate speech, I would like to see less of this.

That's not my point. My point is about the risk to reward ratio
---
Eve mods do this shit all the time and literally hide threads every day from people they don't like. If it ever happens, contact /u/dumbdwarf .. He either did it, or will find out who did and then proceed to laugh his ass off.
---
Serious question:
---
Has CCP put any thought on updating the available corporation logo combinations and colours, it seems somewhat limiting when you see the same logo combinations again and again.
---
Joke question:
---
Have you ever considered a GM Iceberg paintbrush competition, as clearly he has talented paintbrush skills.
---
Have you got his drawings on the CCP Fridge? 
---
(the medal drawing was seen, it was hilarious)
---
Idk man you seemed pretty salty in the stream, also it has your name on it and everything think of it as free advertising for your stream
---
My only argument here is that a cap FC said caps end in the sun when the cyno dies.
---
   
---
The rest i don't care enough to even argue about. I can think of a few work arounds, some mechanical some human nature. I can think of ways to counter them. I can not think of an accurate assessment of the situation until we actually get these changes. All of this is just brainstorming at the current point in time.
---
How much? And do you really trust him or only pretend to trust him? ;P

How the Hel can a super carrier be in a 1.0 system?

Or just pay a few mill ISK and have your PI stuff hauled. It's what I do. Cuts about 3% off profits, but saves me time+risk.
---
now this I understand;)
---
well that could be one thing.
---
Honestly, I'm not at all sure myself if a jump interdiction ability would be a good idea. But for sure it would be interesting to see how it plays out. There is a freaking lot that could go wrong, and stuff that goes wrong, often goes really fun afterwards.
---
This idea would for sure be extremely dangerous if you would implement it, and remove it 2 years later because it's broke. But if you (as CCP) would be okey to turn it back after a month, I think it would be worth a try for sure.
---
But you cant light a cyno anymore. What you gonna do  gate them 10 jumps in 5 minutes ?
---
It was a hull timer
---
DELET THIS
---
I’ve stopped bothering with this subreddit 90% of the time these days because they just delete every second post. It’s really killing the sub. I’m surprised they didn’t just delete this one yet tbh
---
While just throwing the names would initiate an investigation, providing some accompanying information, even if not evidence, but an actual description of what the character is doing; can make such investigation easier.
---
We don't expect players to conduct the investigation on their own as that's not your role, but if you have some information that might be helpful, don't hesitate to bring it forward.
---
You actually believe that Mr. Botter decided only because of blackout to increase his bot farm from 50 to 100? And not before it, when botting was easier?
---
Do you have (legal) ways to fight botters and RMTers outside of the game? If yes, do you use any? If no, have you ever considered it?
---
I would like ano ingame  name of the most whiney character
---
Most of these question seem more Dev oriented, But I can answer # 5 and #6.

\- Working at CCP is actually super cool. Im told that most companies in the gaming industry are like this, but my career background comes from the customer service industry. There, we were just a number. Here at CCP, I feel like a human. A Person. I mean, we have jars of cookies on every floor, bowls of fresh fruit, a masseuse, they feed us here in house, instead of making you figure out lunch for your self (and its damn good food too). Choosing to work for CCP has literally been the best decision i have made in my life.

---
Nope, because fuck us.
---
I know that the security team is not necessarily part of the frontline CS teams. I'm hearing a lot of XX not responded for weeks. Do you think we need additional manpower to help sort through that (if even temporary) to address this?
---
Yes! Yummy.
---
Risk is not lower in wormhole or fw space.
---
You clearly don't know your game mechanics if you're talking about him not knowing his game mechanics. The slightest bit of server load will result in supers &amp; titans landing all over the system, especially when there is no cyno location to route to.
---
Another issue people aren't considering is the fact recons (let's face it, no one is gonna use a blackops) have a much smaller spherical model - this means when stuff jumps in EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BOUNCE. The server is going to absolutely shit itsself and mass crashes will most assuredly ensue as the algos try to calculate all that shit.
---
Pepto Bismal, but it has to be under the hot dog, because who would eat a hot dog with pink sauce on it?  SGM Archduke obv.
---
That would be a question to the Team Security. Game Masters rarely deal with bot reports directly, so we cannot really answer your question, sorry.

Archduke here, from a GM committee handling offensive content reports. Feel free to submit a support ticket requesting a review of a warning if you feel that it was not justified. We are people too, and can make mistakes sometimes - and we're happy to re-evaluate such cases.  
---
Not sure I know what you mean by "Any word as to whether this is true"..? Are you asking if we're giving the Chinese community preferential treatment here? Because if so, the simple answer is no.
---
We dont ask why. We only document.
---
Thanks for taking the time, I appreciate the effort put to keep us the community safe.  I hope you all apply the same care to yourselves.

“Bookmark Entrance”.  It’s a simple thing that I manage to forget EVERY time...fml.
---
there is no pve interesting enough that it cannot be botted.  but there could easily be pve that is interesting enough that a player engaging in pve would not want to bot or afk it because its fun.  whenever you're ratting or mining you're engaging in an activity that's so boring that "why the hell wouldn't i bot this" comes to mind.  there is a reason players keep trying to maximize the afkness of eve pve, and that's because it's so atrocious that people feel the need to approximate botting it in order to tolerate it.
---
Yes, there is a dedicated team at CCP that deals with bots: Team Security. Sometimes we, Game Masters, work with them together, but mainly the "security" of the game is their responsibility, while Game Masters are focused on legit players' experience.
---
Clearly you're missing the point. They don't want you to setup an immortal Cyno that can never die and stays open so an endless army of ships pour through. They want you to bring enough Recons and Black Ops that you can sustain your fight. If they die too quickly, or the other side brings more, then you lose.
---
Red.
---
Not lost at least one ship every day. Lol! I’m a scrub
---
 That would be a question to the Team Security. Game Masters rarely deal with bot reports directly, so we cannot really answer your question,  sorry.
---
Thank you for the answer, hopefully a dev is also able to shed some light on the rest.

According to the MER it is. WH space generates 1/3rd the isk of K space while not having close to 1/3rd the isk destroyed.
---
Do you require some [mod bias?](https://i.imgur.com/rEj0MhA.png)
---
So we have heard a lot about player retention numbers being pretty low. Since you guys have seen a lot in the game and interface with people who are having trouble, what do you think is the main cause?
---
Follow up: what is something I can do as a player to help keep new players playing?
---
Does the look outside function still provide usable input for bots? I thought they mostly pulled from.the overview.
---
If you think a particular character might be a bot and you have reported it already, then there's not much more you can do about it, except reporting it again.
---
Game Masters rarely deal  with bot reports directly as those matters are handled by the Team Security, but I can tell you that all reports are being investigated and none are ignored.
---
They literally stand still already
---
Comparing eve to wow is just silly. The depth of content in eve is much larger.
---
Distance farm bots have been botting d-scan as a measure to automatically safe up for a while now. I think you’d have to use recons.
---
Все нормальные игроки давно сюда заехали, потому что весь свежак - тут.
---
Good catch! No one knows, though.
---
Was going to say never killed a Titan... But, that changed tonight.... I know... Never lost a Titan... Can't fly it yet. lol.
---

---
Unfortunately I am limited by time and space.   
---
Lets start with simple flavors. Vanilla. The most basic of basics. Vanilla doesnt try to be something its not. It is simply, vanilla.   
---
Cherry Ice Cream (Maraschino (sp?) flavor obv) Milkshake. Simple, yet passionate.   
---
Most of Ben &amp; Jerry's. Cookie dough. Cherry Garcia. Brownie Fudge. Complex flavors and textures. Like Carnival floats in Brazil.   
---
New favorite - Licorice. the color is Grey like the weather in Iceland. Salty like the Icelandic Sea. Some grit from the salt, similar to the grit on the icy sidewalks.
---
Didn't have potato mode for the whole fight... Man it was beautiful.
---
Easy kills tbh
---
I was wondering where the fuck could I find a decent AAR of what seems like a great fight after reading that karma-whoring "habbening" post... yours isn't, but it's still better than nothing.
---
It is.  People always out to make perfect the enemy of the good.
---
Team 3 is just the extra's threes only 1 person from goons and nc.
---
It greatly reduced it though. You cant deny that forcing people to set up these intricate systems is going to raise the barrier to entry by a ton. The way i see it, anything helps.
---
Flair checks out
---
Yes, absolutely yes! We always try to improve rookie experience, GMs as well. We have many people working on it, lots of people are very dedicated to make a new experience better.
---
We'll gladly take your observations and will pass it on to the right people so that it can be processed. 
---
The best way of letting us know? I'd say tickets and the official forum :) 
---
Forum is always monitored by Community team and devs do read it.
---
Can I come work at CCP?
---
Why is your name and text in red?
---
Cause adversity is racist
---
You said that there would be more demand for bots because of blackout and other changes, and I responded to that. But I guess you mean that more players could start botting (instead of existing botters scaling up), and I can agree with that.
---
Howdy. Thank you for everything you folks do. 
---
1. Is there any future plans on expanding on older EVE lore? Ex. like what happened to the Jove, any new developments regarding the EVE gate, Iapetan titans. 
---
2. The billboards. Extremely disappointed how they were changed. Yes I know he has a clear vision, and can't even buy the star captain fessor skin that's advertized. Do you know why they removed all the player made ones? Would be nice to see them back. It's terrible without any variety.
---
My earlier callout thread got deleted aswell, so ai will just post it again
---
Today I posted this AAR after our fight with gotg, including the BR thanking the parties involved. I came back from town to find my amazing post deleted, to make space for a „happening thread“ including only the titan and isk losses without any AAR.
---
I request an apology and 2 Fedos in Jita or I will piss on ur ankles Have a nice day
---
Safer to warp to a moon or an anomaly off a given planet at range.
---
Chinese, botting.. No never... In before accusations, not racism, it's statistical facts.
---
Where is scavenger hunt happening? And what I need to participate.
---
No, he responded by someone who is new and doesn't understand how everything works yet.
---
Navy blue for sure &lt;3
---
To be honest, there's so much things to do in this game that listing what I have done in almost 10 years would be shorter than listing what I haven't.
---
It's a rayfish tbh.
---
Recons and Black Ops are simply to squishy to sustain long enough. Imagine you wanna dreadbomb  a small supercarrier force of 5 supers. Your Dreads should be in a radius of maximum of 50km. Every Blops / Recon will be volleyd before he even can say "Mercy". So you wont bring enough dreads in to fight them. If you could jump in a "cyno Dread/Fax", you could activate you capital emergency damage controll and survive long enough, to bring in a substantial ammount of your own caps/supers. Buffer Caps are easy to kill, but they won´t die like flys.
---
whats the cruelest thing you've done to a player?
---
Yeah it was, it's the "Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy" joke question... The answer given in the book is 42.
---
42
---
log off in their system.  Log back in
---
Free infinite kills
---
Until the bots are tested and more widely distributed, of course. Then we're back to square one.
---
And here I thought it was going to be about the Drifter...
---
I actually do :)
---
But if mods started banning spodbrains, how would you post here afterwards? :(
---
Horde is cool though.
---
Why does a game where you can spend thousands of dollars on a subscription over the years and invest so much time into not have an anti-cheat? There are cheap little first person shooters that have actual anti-cheat.
---
The b-team strikes again \0/
---
Oh?
---
Moving supers and titans solo was very safe, only stupid or impatient people lost them.
---
How do you balance differing demands from differing customers? For instance, suicide ganking must give you a headache (sorry!).
---
Lets be clear here, Dogs are superior to cats. Only exception is if the Cat IS a Dog.
---
&gt;my chihuahua will piss on ur ankles and bite ur dick Have a nice day
---
That might sound like a good time to a few people.
---
As to the pocos and easy money, and if you want to disrupt them...
---
Kill their pocos maybe? That will force them to relocate their PI at least, and cut off their investments in the meantime
---
I lived Overseas as well.  5-7 Skype interviews later.....Boom im freezing my butt off in the most northern Capital city in the world.
---
&gt;That being said, we usually only take action on matters that are reported through our support ticket system.
---
Want a screenshot? or will you ban me after doing that for quoting support staff? 
---
Both are about a CSM member, both made comments publicly one was removed from the CSM for doing so and one wasn't, one used a racial slur and one used a slur based on sexuality, what other conclusion do you want me to draw ? 
---
&gt; the second case you mentioned wasn't reported to us.
---
Again do i have you permission to screenshot a the ticket system yes or no ?
---
Of course! Always. Whenever it's a bug or just a typo, or an issue with translation or any sort of feedback, we do forward it.
---
Mind that sometimes we are not the first ones to report it, and in this case our report and our gathered information is basically attached to one big report, that was created before us. Sadly, we can't guarantee the immediate fix, as this is not something GMs can control.
---
Before blackout I had 2 Alts 👀 on gates. Every enemy that was in the system received 1 isk. That was a way to told them I saw you bitch, get out of the way. I've been called this and that but the best was a dude who asked me what bot is that and how come they made bots so sofisticated and he doesn't have them? For every line he posted I was giving him 1 isk. He noticed and he asks for more. I was not replying to local chat I was doing my thing in carrier. At one point I give him 1 mil. 5 mils 7 mils and he went nuts 🤪 the line that killed me was... Come back to computer and me what bot is that. We were like 10 on voice chat dead, laughing like there is no tomorrow. At one point I'm telling, dude I'm trolling you for 5 minutes and you think bots are sofisticated? He blocked me and never returned the donations! Scammer! 😂
---
Thanks for the answer.
---
As for the features I also meant ingame ones.
---
And from personal experience I can say: Good, easy to read logs are worth so much, and they are hard to get right.
---
First, the subject is CCP developing "anti-cheat" software.  Not turning all ratting into incursions.
---
Which, btw, would suck.  "Ok, to make any money, just sign up for the ratting queue and wait your turn".  Utterly fantastic with an aging player base where a growing number of players can't commit to long, uninterrupted blocks of play time.
---
Second, none of the PVE you proposed is un-botable.  Remember, they're able to read the screen and memory of the game client.
---
Third, bots are already easy-to-slaughter for players - they can't handle logon traps.  We don't do it much because very few people think it's fun to do day in, day out.  Which means the bots are still very profitable replacing the occasional loss.  So relying on players to do what they are already not doing isn't going to fix it.
---
People had login/cloak bots... just have that except repeat the cloak function 500km off the gate
---
Every 5 minutes
---
^^ Ships are ammo not investments ^^
---
If dogs are so superior then why does mine like to destroy a helpless snake https://i.imgur.com/ATXJPrS.jpg
---
You have to install a processer overclocking unit
---
There's a difference between having to actually create software and invest in multiple accounts to automate something, and having game mechanics so dead simple and risk free, that literally anyone with a free macro software and 10 minutes can setup an isk farm.
---
Even the setup OP describes is far from risk free. Jump in, log off, stay away for hours, then get your friends and tear them apart.
---
That's the difference. They are not safe anymore.
---
I recently revisited 20 systems which I had marked as POS VNI farms pre-blackout. None of them had any VNIs or POSs anymore. There's your players leaving cause of blackout. Great success. 👍
---
File a reimbursement claim with your cat ;)
---
Haha, nice. I was traveling around Laki area 3-4 weeks ago. Didn't see that there, so maybe it's fresh. Now I wonder myself what's up with it. Will report if I ever find out!
---
We currently have an event going, so you can get on a killing spree to get some SP! :) 
---
Nothing is ever free though.
---
You would be better off with a 2min spool up time and 1min duration on caps. That way you either light before an inhib gets anchored so an organised defence fleet can drop or you're dead.
---
Try an Ashimmu. It has a web range bonus to slow them down, and a neut bonus to cap them out real quick, after that they should get demolished pretty quickly under your guns. Alternatively, a pilgrim or RLML legion. If you're talking about heavy armor as in C5 wormhole heavy armor, then the ashimmu and pilgrim might be too flimsy, but the legion should hold up. If the frigates you're shooting are receiving reps, you'll either need an artillery platform (Loki or Muninn), or enlist the help of your fleet once you have them controlled with neuts/webs. 
---
Here's an example fit - this will absolutely demolish any frigate unwise enough to find itself within 36km of it. Caps them out in 10-15 seconds, then applies 360 DPS to them until they die, and sports a solid tank to boot. Not bad for a 250M ISK ship.

That's not a fair metric. Risk doesn't necessarily translate to loss. And the skill ceiling in j-space is much higher.
---
1 every 2d means \~175 tickets they receive per yr, which represents 1% of overall tickets.
---
So 18k (maybe 20k) overall tickets that they receive per yr.
---
Shush big Tuz needs to act like he has big insight to contribute rather than just being a logistics mule.

Shh dont ruin his narrative.
---
Goons TOTALLY blobbed the fight.
---
Grr evil Goons ruining the game grrr.
---
Or going straight ahead to Episode II: Attack of the Drones?
---
The point is that a 200 man super fleet should not be able to be brought in by one character if the defenders are on point.  You will have to keep welping recons in and jumping a few to each cyno--but this gives more counterplay to defenders, who now can use bubbles to make it hard to the recons to position, and so on.  It's just adding a huge element of skill and organization to... organized endgame content.  Which is the entire goal.
---
You'll probably get banned for doing this long before ccp does anything about the Myrm bots.
---
until 7 large smartbombs... never mind
---
It's like you totally didn't read any of the nuance in their reply.
---
T3Ds can fit combat probes for free, but any T1 or T2 destroyer or frigate will be severely gimped if you try to cram an expanded probe launcher on them. So I'd go with a hecate or confessor.

We try to be as impartial as possible and to affect the game as little as we can. When the game breaks, we step in. When the game works like it should, we don´t. It´s not always a clear line what is what though...
---
That’s the point.
---
Do you guys go to Iceland Airwaves this year?(if yes can I buy you a beer).Can you recommend some local artists I should look forward to :)
---
We are conducting such tests ourselves, but sure, if you by any means have a list of issues that a new player stumbles upon, it might be worth sharing. Best if you share it on the forums, so maybe other players can add some of their input as well, but you could as well send us a ticket and we will forward the information to the developers.
---
&gt; And the skill ceiling in j-space is much higher.
---
According to who now? Both J and K space don't have local anymore, and it's much harder to control hostile access to K space than J space.
---
They do pull the overview. Im not sure how the look outside function will work. Since you dont get useable info from it
---
I honestly don´t think I´ve ever done anything cruel (on my GM account). I´m always fair (on my GM account), honest (on my GM account) and nice (on my GM account).

---
CCP to develop anti-cheat ? They couldn't even get local to work right for so long, they just deleted it and called it a feature.
---
I am one of the 124 who had problems with  "King of the Hill" missions  . And that was quickly settled
---
The best way of asking him is:
---
Oi bruv! Ye got a loisence feh that gaming pc?
---
Existing botters have to put in more effort
---
Potential botters have more reason to bot.
---
Thus more bots.
---
Slow down and read what he's saying bro
---
Apply to one of jobs posted!
---
Which is why I would immediately stop playing if eve were to introduce anti-cheat. It would either have to run as root and compromise privacy/security, or be useless. And even when it runs as root there is still no way to catch determined botters causing people to lose their aforementioned privacy for nothing.

Jump the dreads in 500km off and warp them to the bubbled supers. They'll be having the same problem with their reinforcement cynos.
---
How much spice does one have to consume to be certified spicy boy/girl?
---
Not everyone has SRP
---
These bots most likely run 100% alpha with spoofed IPs
---
It´s allready hard to commit as offender vs a fleet with an allready loaded grid. You don´t want it to be harder. Everytime a big brawl like today happens, people are happy and dozens of artikels will cover it on reddit. The players want those events to happen, if you can´t bring enough trough 1 cyno people won´t commit.
---
What is a bookmark?
---
Oh ok. No problem!
---
&gt;If something isn't clear in our internal documentation (which is fairly vast), then we often turn to the EVE uni wiki and google.
---
When trying to edit or get the most up to date information for these wikis would a support ticket be best?
---
What's the most wholesome GM ticket that you got involved with?
---
Is GM team aware about lack of lowsec gate to Stain?
---
That’s the entire point.
---
A cyno is one of the most powerful capability a ship can have, especially under a super umbrella. It should take skill / effort to bring a massive super / capital fleet on grid.
---
DevHax.  
---
No really, the GM teleports the botter to Yulai and flags them so players can destroy them instead of the GM just instablaping them wherever they were originally.
---
New and doesn’t know says “oh I didn’t know, what should I do ? ” he did not say anything close.
---
You are the big yikes
---
It's not one character now, it's generally at least three.
---
Besides, I thought the point of the change was to make rorq/ratting capital saves more challenging, and to buff small gang roaming. Literally no one has been complaining about fleet fights being broke.
---
Finally, welping recons isn't exactly engaging gameplay.
---

Something that conveys passion. WAY to much black is worn here in Iceland, like its a perpetual funeral.

But do you like Waffles?

---
Bots don't need omega accounts
---
this joke actually gets old pretty quickly
---
the second you jump in your dreads, your own cyno will be bubbled from enemy dictors, you won´t reach those supers.
---
So for last fanfest there was a small tournament to count which alliance had the most players in attendance 
---
Now the bots alliances are being named and shamed could we do the same tournament at events except we minus the total number of bots/rmt,ers 
---
As well as public executions like we currently have 
---
Ultimate embarrassment is needed
---
Five titans and two titans merge to make the SDF1 and punch someone in the face with a Hel...
---
I literally mean the skill ceiling is higher. Skill points. J space is far less accessible.
---
still wont show if i do that :/
---
I don't know how would one define whether this system is successful or not, but what is clear to me is that this system functions as a deterrent for players who would potentially make a goal of killing newbies in particular. 
---
While what you say is true about the rookies with losses having higher retention rates, it is only true for when they have somewhat meaningful interactions, even if those result in a loss.
---
Rookie griefing most of the time relies on the fact that the rookie have no idea what's going on and is unable to react. This only brings frustration.
---
Not when they're punching up like this. The highest of props to them.
---
I prefer not to think of the perfect exemplification of the demise of the human species.
---
Ok, sure 😂
---
Never been in a wormhole
---
I would like to continue this conversation if I could. What mode of  communication works for you?
---
Yeah. So?
---
It’s one click to light and right click jump to send in a capital / super fleet right now.
---
That is not hard.
---
&gt; TRYRM
---
^^^^Starlord?
---
Who?
---
Whats the actions taken for really bad language. Not the usual ”screw your mom” stuff. But the real deal with n*gger and nazi shit. Do u pull the lever right away or do they get a second chance?
---
[Be excellent to each other](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rph_1DODXDU)
---
Oh I agree there's still ways around border logging bots.
---
But on the flip side of that as someone who's programmed bots for EVE and a few other MMO's in the past, this would just make me want to code another function to cross reference people *exiting* systems I'm watching with who I know has entered.
---
Now if eyes are on at least 1 side of every gate on your interior, you'll know if that gang of a dozen didn't make entry via gate into your space, so you can auto-ping that there's a WH in X system that needs to be rolled, regardless of which side of the gate the eyes are on you'll know exactly which system it's in.
---
Could even automatically deploy a roller bot in a cheap high mass ship to scan it down and roll it out.
---
Granted this could always have been done before blackout, but now there's incentive to go this deep down the rabbit hole for the bot coders.
---
No no no I think everyone is missing the point of this Capitals should not be able to light cynos at all - put some skin in the game if you want to bring your cap fleet in.  I am sorry but this is one of the best ideas CCP has come up with in awhile.  Makes people have to commit some force recons on field to light a cyno.  Yeah they can be squishy but that is the point.  It will now take strategy to take fights or to have your big toys out.
---
hang out in the english help channel
---
Do that shit but without cyno field lmao. Easy fix
---
I can neither confirm nor deny the existence of ~~redacted~~
---
If there was a ticket about the second case, I could look into it without a screenshot - just give me the ticket ID.  
---
But again, context matters. I don't recall these specific cases off the top of my head, but it could very well be that in the first case there were **other** issues as well, not just the use of an offensive word, and they added up to a more...harsh action being taken.  
---
What I can tell you with 100% certainty - and without breaking our own internal rules - is that players using either of the slurs you mentioned do receive official warnings. These warnings have the same exact weight as well, which is why I'm thinking that there were some other factors involved as well that you may not be aware of.
---
Yes, plenty! There are so many teams within the office, and each of them are responsible for different things. Sometimes the areas of what we are doing kind of interlace with each other and the GMs might need access to certain systems that they don't. Sometimes it can be a bit tough to handle, since you eventually need to catch a bunch of people to get a certain data from a certain system, that noone else is using except this one guy, for instance :D It's just an example, I hope I understood your question correctly :) 
---
Not the GMs per se, it's more of a Community team.
---
I guess to each their own, GMs usually work on all sorts of stuff. Personally? It's always tough to deny something, when you know that it is important to someone. For me it was always hard to read the stories about cats/dogs/little brothers and sisters who accidentally logged into someone's account and sold all the stuff and then deleted the char :)
---
That's a myth... AUTZ is dead... They must have all been ago and crashed into each other
---
\&gt;i guess they re not just in space for 24 hours
---
No, they are limited to 23.75 hours per downtime.
---
&gt; Which, btw, would suck. "Ok, to make any money, just sign up for the ratting queue and wait your turn". Utterly fantastic with an aging player base where a growing number of players can't commit to long, uninterrupted blocks of play time.
---
I would think that you alliance is capable of gathering 20 guys in battleships considering that, you know, you own sov. If your alliance can't do that it has no business being in sov null. I think 45 minutes to an hour is a reasonable block of time for PVE, it's about the same a wow dungeon, maybe a bit longer. Maybe cut down expected site time to 5 minutes, and have 4 sites to allow 10 minutes to travel time to have 30 minute blocks of time.
---
The sites were balanced for "around" 20 players doesn't mean you need exactly 20, plusminus a couple could work, and even if the fleet doesn't want to take more into the site, you can be eyes on the accel gate/cyno for backup and get tips. Or just grab some willing people and make your own fleet and run a site in another chain in another constellation.
---
Anything they produce now is easier to beat than local intel was.
---
You can find new players and give them a hand, explain something, tell interesting story, etc. The "connection" with other players in EVE has been proven to have a great impact on retention.
---
In other words, people matter to people. Make yourself matter to someone. That's how you keep others in EVE.
---
story behind this fight?
---
Why have offensive anchorables, when you can have offensive links for boosting ships. Such as CYNO jammers and dscan Messer uppers. Just curious.
---
Hi GM's!  
---
I would very much like to know the following:  
---
Which GM is the best dresser?  
---
Which GM is the most knowledgeable of the game?  
---
Which GM is the funniest?  
---
If i was stuck in the Amazon rainforest and i could pick one GM to help me escape alive, which one would i take and why ?
---
The 100 people that play on it will really get that economy moving!
---
It does differ by year but we get a bit more than 20k per year.
---
Last year we got a total of 163,403 tickets!
---
&gt; Potential botters have more reason to bot.
---
This I agree with, as I said in my previous comment.
---
&gt; Existing botters have to put in more effort
---
&gt;Thus more bots.
---
This I don't get. If existing botter now needs more bots to do the same thing, why would they not have just used the more bots before, if they had the capacity. You think just because things get more difficult, they would decide to scale up? Why would they not have scaled up earlier anyways. Also they could just change a game. Hardcore botters don't care what game they bot, as long as it is profitable.

We have access to all the tools and logs we need to have access to. I can´t think of any pertinent information or data we don´t have access to.
---
We are the investigative experts in the company and we know the logs and tools the best out of everyone because we use them the most. So we are often asked to help with various different things that require in depth game and tool knowledge. CSM investigations included. But it depends on what´s being investigated.

There´s nothing really bad about the job. But it is a job like every other and it requires the same commitment as any job and I guess that all the worst parts about the job would apply to any other job.

The allready staged fleet should have more Cap ( remember jumping needs cap ), shouldnt´t be in movement out of controll ( bumping capitals is fun... ) and all pilots have a feeling for the grid. Especaly in TIDI fights it takes ages to load the grid and modells.

Bots; if you see them, report them.

Would there be a way to let players know the length of a queue in the support ticket system? Have a guy who hasn't got a response to his ticket in the realm of disputing a ban. You know like some ER's have for hospitals just to let people know what to expect and wait for before they're answered
---
We're more low class heavy armor, so that ashimmu is perfect after some minor modifications. this is exactly the kind of tool we need in our fleet. Thanks!
---
It is too much when our systems and procedures indicates so. Sorry, can't be more specific ;)
---
I know this isn't helpful at all, so let's put it this way:
---
As to the tactic itself, it is ok if you drop some drones or containers and position them in a way to disturb ships coming from particular directions. You won't need that many drones or containers for that. But if you are thinking about covering whole gate from each possible direction with a mass of drones or containers, then this is not the way to do it as you would require hundreds of drones and that may cause lag. 
---
I hope this makes sense, but feel free to ask for a clarification, if needed.
---
Hey GM-Team,
---
how do you handle support tickets in foreign languages? Are there GM teams in all major "language zones" like for example : Germany/France/Russia?
---
Or do you google translate your way through the tickets? :D
---
you could literally disappear a moon mining POS into its own grid with the right manipulation so it wouldn't appear to anyone warping to the moon.  It'd still show up on dscan and you could probe it, but a normal ship would never find it
---
Note for later - never accept food from GM IceCream.
---
We don't actually maintain those resources so no. Your best bet is probably to talk to the EVE University people directly if you want to contribute :)
---
If you see something out of date on our Help Center, do file a ticket though and we'll address it ASAP. By Help Center I mean here:

That looks so much better than it did watching the very tail end of the fight on Pando's stream.  Was very enjoyable to see that interaction.
---
He literally asks why his fit is bad, and explains why he thought it was better than the alternative. You think someone not understanding the game is an idiot? Geez.
---
Thank you! I'm flattered :)
---
&gt;I would think that you alliance is capable of gathering 20 guys in battleships considering that, you know, you own sov. 
---
I would think you'd realize that this isn't the problem I was talking about, since I was explicitly talking about a queue of people waiting to join.
---
The existence of a queue would indicate that there's more than 20, and you're having to wait your turn to be in one of the 20 (40, 60, etc) slots.
---
&gt;I think 45 minutes to an hour is a reasonable block of time for PVE
---
My 5 year old doesn't.  Which is why I mentioned "aging player base" as part of the problem.
---
Delaying real life for one anomaly is not hard.  Delaying real life for 45 minutes, when you can't even bail out on the site because you plan points everyone, is a problem.
---
&gt;you can be eyes on the accel gate/cyno for backup and get tips. 
---
Oh boy.  That's compelling gameplay.
---
EVE needs more stuff like that because the game sure as hell is shitty without it.
---
So it's not white chocolate milkshake
---
The "barrier to entry" is pretty irrelevant to the kind of botting we see in EVE. We are talking about people spending huge amounts of effort setting things up regardless, so the need to add a few alpha accounts to the mix isn't going to deter them. The blackout may have *changed* how some things need to be done, but they haven't really *complicated* things in any significant way.
---
Add some alpha accounts, update the software, and the parasites are back in business.
---
Aaaa what... This is how fleets have been bombing for a very long time lol... Sure there is cloaky perch bombing, but this is standard stuka bombing lol, nice work tho... Is great to see everyone doing it now tho, just too bad we all know that means CCP nerf bat is incoming any day now.  
---
Nothing quite like wiping 150-200 HACs or BCs with a bombs, we had an incredible week earlier this month think I was on 450 kills with bombs alone on the span of like 4 days, and I missed a few of the runs... Hope when the nerf comes it doesn't eliminate this type of bomber fleet, maybe just make it a bit harder...
---
So blue donut guild?
---
In customer service, you almost always deal with negativity. Ex. My product is broken, your service is subpar, your products are subpar, the technician did not arrive to fix my product..etc.
---
So, when I get a ticket not asking for anything, or complaining (maybe rightfully so), but instead saying.... "Hey, Thank you for what you do."
---
It makes me all warm and fuzzy inside. I may not be Steve Jobs and invented the next life changing gadget, or curing Cancer, or be the next great leader. That, however, does not mean that I cannot make the world a better place one smile at a time. If through my actions I can bring even the slightest amount of joy to someones life, even if for a second. #WorthIt. 
---
Compound all the little smiles I can create on a daily basis, add all the Days, weeks, months, years even....I can impact the lives of thousands of people. Everyone has the power to change the world for the better.

how do you deal with throw away alts(for ganking noobs or just suicideganking/awoxing etc) and multiboxing alpha accounts?
---
My earlier  2 callout threads got  deleted aswell, so I will just post it again Today I posted this AAR after our fight with gotg, including the BR thanking the parties involved. I came back from town to find my amazing post deleted, to make space for a „happening thread“ including only the titan and isk losses without any AAR.
---
I request an apology and 2 Fedos in Jita or my chihuahua will piss on ur ankles and bite ur dick Have a nice day

can someone explain to me why bots are bad
---
Oh, if you’re talking about warp from station to anom then yeah..get better intel, or don’t let reds in while you initiate warp. Doh. Seemed like common sense.
---
Thought you were complaining about being caught aligning out of an anom.
---
NC LULW
---
It hasn't made botting harder at all. It's just removed one form of intel a bot can use to not lose a ridiculously cheap ship that they can replace in 40-60 minutes of not dying. 
---
EVE is probably the easiest game in the history of gaming to bot, especially when everything in game can be done by hovering a mouse button and clicking. 
---
It's made worse by the fact that it's nearly impossible to tell the difference between a bot and an actual player, since the bots react exactly like players do when they don't want to die. It's also worth mentioning that every proposed change to solve the issue detrimentally affects real players.
---
It doesn't matter what CCP does, there will always be bots. It's a cat and mouse game that goes on forever. Kill drone aggro, the bot will manually target and aggress. Make rats kill drones, the bot will swap to a different ship. Get rid of local, the bots will just watch gates. Start banning people based on in-game activity over time, the bots will just set log-off timers. Prune alpha accounts so far back that they can't complete NS anoms, they'll just do it in HS. 
---
There just aren't any good, tangible, reasonable suggestions that hurt bots and don't also hurt real players - if there were, CCP would implement it.
---
~~ALL HAIL LELOUCH!~~
---
I just want to thank you guys for putting up with our bullshit day in and day out.
---
Hi, question on my mind is a litlle bit.. tough? What (when) was the most surprising moment for all you guys, that got you even up from chairs - when you released some mechanics that you expected that way it will work, and we, players across whole universe, we adapted to it, and even more, bended and changed the rules, and used it for ourselves in way, you never intended or thought about that we could (not abuse it, its strong word) use it the way, we wanted?
---
There's nothing wrong with the volatile skins. They're either limited event skins or they're faction skins that are dropped in game and they've been around since skins were introduced. They have nothing to do with PA and the doom and gloom reaction to this is fucking dumb.
---
None of those issues are difficult to deal with.
---
I can't go into too much detail, but this largely depends on the context, the history of the account in question and other factors. Simply put, we have an escalating system of warnings -&gt; temporary suspensions -&gt; permanent ban.
---
The bots could just man the Citadel though, which provides an overview and everything they need.
---
^(Just don't tell the Chinese.)
---
Fired a DD.
---
Coz I'm poor.
---
Yes, we do. Many of us have daily meetings with the dev teams where we can share the feedback we receive from the players.
---
GM Spider is an impeccable dresser and handsome to boot.
---
I have to pick between a few very knowledgeable GMs but I would think that GM Vertical would win the EVE Pub Quiz.
---
Funniest? Depends on your particular sense of humor but I personally find that GM Arcade cracks me up.
---
About half of our GM Team is from Iceland. We are terrified of insects and can´t tolerate heat above 15 degrees Celsius. Most of us would probably decrease your chance of survival in a rainforest unless you were using us for eating. But GM Icecream lived near a rainforest for many years so he´s probably your best bet.
---
By that do you mean some thing like, "I subbed X amount of time before this offer and now it is X cheaper ccplease refund me"
---
Black.

Crap I didn't scroll far enough

My perspective -

Best Dresser - GM Huginn (Old School Cool)

Hello! 
---
We do try our best to restore everything that we only can. The thing is, that all the hacks are done case-be-case, and although we DO have certain policies and internal guides, this cases are different. 
---
While there are many reasons why sometimes it is not possible, the main issue is an and always was - compromised personal email. If the email, that is associated with the account is compromised, then we simply cannot confirm ownership. Compromised emails are the main reason the accounts get hacked, sadly. 
---
So it's not uncommon that in the cases where we potentially could have restored all items and billions of ISK they would get into the wrong hands once again. We'd rather not to take this risk and I am sure you understand why. We had those cases, I've seen all of it from all the possible angles. 
---
Restoration in these cases IS possible, but it will require more time, unfortunately, as it is much more work. I can't even guarantee that all the items can be restored, since we can't just spawn them as we want. Every decision has to be measured very carefully.
---
As someone who used to say a lot of stupid shit on this stupid subreddit, its possible

Or like... "Why only one of my accounts got this offer"? Or accidental purchases. Or just the wrong idea about the offer. You name it :)
---
The intel pod should be easy to detect by CCP? Then also detect associated characters through shared system time.
---
Personally I don't know why they don't set a super low threshold for "suspect account" and then throw a shit load of captchas at the account for pretty much every interraction in-game. A "click here to verfiy your account" button would stop it being a pain for the false positives.

/u/Yonis_Pserad It appears this thread has vanished and is hidden. Are you surprised? I'm not. They do it every day. Which mod doesn't like you?

While the rp is appreciated, you are not where a new player should start in Eve.
---
Thank you for the answer. I hoped something more precise but didn't really expected it tbh. This way I have something to reference to if the topic comes up between players.

Generally love the customers support by you guys. Keep up the good work.

&gt; Which GM is the best dresser?

SGM Huginn, hands down. Looks like a private investigator from the 1920s.
---
&gt; Which GM is the most knowledgeable of the game? 
---
SGM Karidor, followed by SGM Vertikal.
---
&gt; Which GM is the funniest? 
---
That's...tough. I'd say...LGM Arcade, but also LGM Stardust, maybe.
---
&gt;If i was stuck in the Amazon rainforest and i could pick one GM to help me escape alive, which one would i take and why ?
---
You're probably SOL on this one. There are no real good options for this :)
---
im a new player and i pvp better then this. (40d?)
---
View outside doesn't give you the overview or dscan, but take control gives you access to both. Neither option give you access to the probe scanner (well, the probe scanner pops up in take control, but doesn't show any sigs).
---
Thanks! I will give it a try.
---
My skills are kind of okay with 70mil skillpoints :-)
---
See, the ease of the system is always appreciated, but if you deal with it constantly, on a daily basis, yous top considering it as something tough. That's just a routine for you. When a new person starts doing the same thing as you do, it might seem to him as a... I don't know... quantum physics? :D But after a while he get used as well. 
---
I am not saying that all the systems should be complicated, but the complexity and lots of tiny details is something that can be learned and appreciated later :)
---
Indeed, some of the stuff I get to see makes my day. The creativity is boundless.
---
May you share your setup? I’m using a W520 Thinkpad with 2000M card. Quite old and below min spec, but worked fine until this recent update.
---
Ah, I failed the reference, sorry :D Reading different books now.
---
I don't think you understand the difference between human random and bot random.
---
A bot being random will always generate precision random. Meaning it will always have a pattern even if it generates a different number. This can be anywhere from button press frequency, timing, press hold (holding a key for x amount of time) and other variables.
---
Humans will always have a different value for all these variables. Even if they use a clock to make sure every 5 minutes they press the button. THIS IS NOTICEABLE when you are looking at .000+ of a second for data.
---
Feel free to brush up on the subject before trying to be cute with ignorance.
---
Filthy casual lol
---
:Coughs in Rainforest Cough:
---
Does this constitute premeditated cannibalism?
---
Yes. Don't crucify me, but I actually like the fact that there's no lowsec gate to Stain.
---
&gt; The existence of a queue would indicate that there's more than 20, and you're having to wait your turn to be in one of the 20 (40, 60, etc) slots.
---
That's why I said the requirements can be fuzzy, like WOW flex queue. Run with 17-23 or whatever. Could also be smaller "sites" you run with 5 with the big group sites only spawning in low trusec constellations. Ex, a -0.7 average constellation spawns a 20 and a 5, a -0.4 spawns a 10 and a 5, a -0.1 only spawns a 5. Or even tie it to system upgrades so you can set the spawn to be whatever size up to the trusec limit.
---
&gt; Delaying real life for one anomaly is not hard. Delaying real life for 45 minutes, when you can't even bail out on the site because you plan points everyone, is a problem.
---
What I said was that each site runs for about 5 minutes, similar to a dread siege cycle or industrial core cycle. After that, the group gates to the next site to continue running until they hit the "payout" escalation. The whole chain of 4-5 sites takes 30-45 minutes based on group fit/skill and travel time. If your 5 year old is acting up you can dock up once one site is cleared and catch up with the group later.
---
&gt; Oh boy. That's compelling gameplay. Begging players for money is so fun!
---
That already happens in incursions, groups tip their logi/fc in order to compensate them or risk being blacklisted. It's even more compelling within an alliance because you'd ruin your reputation within the alliance rather than just within the incursion community.
---
You realize cost is not really an issue for major botters? How would you implement it without hurting actual players even more?
---
Boy howdy, do they.
---
And it's hugely useful and often times can be the tipping point between "what's happening here" and "oh, that's pretty obvious now."
---
Big shout out for our GMs (and our players who take the time to fill out Bug Reports.)
---
Lies there are corpses to be had
---
Thoughts on an abyssal market outside of contracts? Or ways for players to "Label" their abyss mods - IE: Fiend AB vs Trash AB
---
Uhhh? No? This game is easy as shit, please stop making it easier, the prime of eve was when it was hard.  Don't need a bunch do snowflakes ruining the game.
---
Never had a lot of isk, because i just started to play 2 months ago.
---
We´d love to but I´m afraid it´s more complicated than it sounds. Our median reply times right now are about a handful of hours but our averages are well above that and the most complicated cases such as banned accounts or ownership disputes can take multiple days to investigate and resolve. Any sort of estimate we´d give when you file a ticket would very likely be inaccurate.
---
There was talk recently about adding mooring to structures, or specific structures. Not much info has been given other than a way to "Moor at a station" and "It's like safe logging". Is there any more info that can be given?
---
When I browse contracts and I see a shady contract, say a Rookie Ibis with its normal contents for 1.39 Bil and someone accepts it 2 minutes later, and both characters contract histories have flags all over them for shady business. Is it enough to press "Report bot" or should I really, even if it is a lot more work write detailed reports about them and send the ticket in?
---
As secondary question. Any plans on introducing new static missions (agent) or one-off (Cosmos) ones or potentially anoms you know of (Or at least updating/fixing current ones)
---
&gt;Personally I'm annoyed by the extra effort needed to report all the botting characters since we can't see their names when they are docked in combination of no local,
---
Isn't it brilliant how the anti bot measures backfires on CCP? In no time the botting problem will be bigger then before blackout.
---
Background info, I'm pretty sure you're talking about this, right?
---
 [https://www.eveonline.com/article/drone-damage-exploit-notification](https://www.eveonline.com/article/drone-damage-exploit-notification) 
---
If so, then yes this was one of my decisions so I can talk about it at length.
---
Honest answer to your question? There wasn't a great deal of thought behind that decision - it wasn't like a pre-calculated 72d chess kind of move. I just wanted to try something different from how we'd usually treat exploits.
---
I'm not really convinced that bans, especially permanent bans, are the way to go when treating exploit abuse, particularly first time offenders. Sure, it depends on the exploit. Something like the moongoo exploit (2008 or 2009?) which had a genuinely bad effect on EVE's economy as a whole is different. I'd still say permanent bans across the line for an exploit of that caliber.
---
But this? It was an easy fix from our perspective (we just reimburse the lost ship). Most of the people who did abuse this exploit ended up contacting us up front, saving us a TON of investigation time. 
---
Ultimately, this was the outcome:
---
The GM team had a hectic day or two answering tickets. The victim got their ship back. The abusers just got a slap on the wrist (well, most of them) and everyone walked away from the table happy.
---
As an experiment I think it went pretty well! Our go-to approach to exploit abuse has become more lenient whenever possible, and I think I'm correct in saying that the drone damage exploit was the first time we did this.
---
An exploit of note is the Ghost Training exploit in 2017 where we applied a pretty lenient approach. I think that went over really well too and even did a talk on it at a few conferences including GDC.

---
How many of you have accidentally crashed the server because you set your ship to infinite size (something that really happened in my time working on SWG), or some similar 'accident' with the GM tools/client?
---
Further Note for even later - use something Ketchup colored.
---
Nobody argued blackout as the absolute solution to botting so the null linemember circlejerk over this in this comment tree is completely meaningless. 
---
The war against bots is incremental. 
---
Of course some of these will watch entrances. But now not only they need such quiet corner systems which is rarer, but also you can afk cloak a Stratios in a botting system to get a kill every 20 minutes (or how much ever the warpback time is). Previously you had to actively work for hours to get a VNI kill. 
---
And of course they will merely go to hisec. But their isk/hr will be lower. And they won't be as inherent to nullsec landscape, paying alliances tax. And they will have to bot in more populated areas, which could mean more people reporting them.
---
There is no absolute cure for botting. It's all about repeated efforts to make their lives a bit harder and harder.
---
Pay no mind to the criticisms made by others here friend.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess, based on your corp history, that you tried eve briefly, left and have just come back.  Welcome (back) to EVE.  It will now have its hooks in you forever.  Sorry about that part.  I'm also going to go out on a limb and say that you're likely trying to earn isk through a mixture of combat/industry/(very, very light) logistics.  This type of gameplay can be very enjoyable but sadly it's also very inefficient in terms of isk/hour.  If you can avoid the temptation to maximize your isk/hour you're 75% of the way to enjoying EVE like bittervets (like myself and others) can't even imagine anymore.
---
Keep experimenting with your fit.  Stick to T1 ships and meta 0-4 modules until you find what works for your play style.  Then start upgrading your modules to T2 and eventually your ship to T2.  If you haven't heard it before, don't fly what you can't afford to lose.

I sometimes link the [8 Golden Rules for EVE Online](https://forums-archive.eveonline.com/topic/491023/) to the players complaining about the game being unjust, other players being cheaters, etc. The last of those rules say *If you lose stuff, it's almost always your fault. Really, only yours.*

I try to be helpful as those rules are really good for adjusting to the world of EVE, but I can see how this might be seen as cruel.

Question for GM IceCream. Do we have a timeline on getting Ice Cream added to the game? It is the only method known to quell the fires of rebellion.

Honestly seeing the same people in stain, constantly in lower and lower numbers is not something i like.           
---
NPC areas should be places where new alliances are born and not places where people run burners on alts.

In Stain current power blocks were created ^(due to how the space was added) but now it is mostly desolate area.

Hello fellow corp leaders, this is not a spam mail. Please take the time to read this if possible. 
---
I am Resuhrrect. I am the corp leader of Adeptus Astartes.. and diplo of the Amarr Faction Warfare alliance Yondu Confederation.
---
I will try to make this as short as possible. We are an active 20ish man faction warfare group that is being actively besieged and assaulted by the corp Did he say Jump led by Predator Elite. I am calling all low sec alliances to help us in our hour of need. I have reached out to many diplo's with little to no returned mails. Knowing diplo's like myself ignore or are too lazy to read mails, I am reaching out to corp ceo's directly. 
---
We currenly have an Azbel, Fortizar, and Athanor in timers by this group who have blobed us with 40+ battleship fleets and 25+ dread bombs. This is not a fair fight, and hasn't been since the start. All the stations in total are around 30-40 bil. 
---
We are asking anyone wiling to come take the fight to them, on our timers. We understand we run the risk of your group finishing the timers, which we are ok with. We do not want this elitist corp to get these free killmails with no pushback or "fair fight"
---
I will warn anyone who is interested, I will be sending this mail to many allliances. Some may be blue to you some may not. I am unsure. 
---
If anyone is willing to help us hold these stations this is what we can offer:
---
-Docking and staging rights for this fort. and system
---
-More cap production for your alliance or corp. We have a few pilots that actively build and sell caps out of the Azbel.

-Willing to blue or temp blue seeing as we do small gang pvp and do not want to take that content away if we find your alliance or group while roaming.

-Help with any station defenses within our range of travel

Out of curiosity and as a member of a fighty C2 org, why are C3's dead and/or less desirable?
---
BRB putting titan inside a Venture and abandoning it right on the gate to Stain.
---
They can get pretty intense in the inner systems. The roaming groups can converge and form giant blobs. It makes farming them quite hair raising at times.
---
\~\~local\~\~ MER is now in delayed mode
---
Its useful, but when compared to a mino you have to make it more bling be the same stats. It can be just as good, but it makes it more expensive
---
I mean you could refer a friend yourself. They upped the SP from 750k to 1,000,000 for the new account.
---
Blackout is much healthier intel-wise. If you’re really having trouble then advocate some way to combat cloaky ships. Something that indicates directionally where they are might be meaningful, while not breaking cloak mechanics. This way you could actively decloak campers and stationary enemy intel etc.
---
Why is CCP so against RMT?
---
If there was a way to do it through the eve web site legally, just charge a fee to make money off each transaction. As long as it's not an insane fee, I think it could work. CCP can still keep their shop just let players have their own and tax that shit.
---
I'm all for RMT it adds value to a players time, which in turn (especially now a days) creates a digital economy. In a sense an exchange rate between time and money where if done right everyone benefits.
---
Sounds like snitching this
---
use buddy link - get 1mil sp, use this 1mil starter pack - get another 1mil sp cheap.         
---
Make revmap and train one things while using this 2mil sp to inject stuff that will be the slowest to train.
---
Definitely would not make the job easier... but some kind of system-exploration mechanic. As in finding and colonizing new systems. Just the idea of building up new space from scratch feels really romantic to me.
---
Enough so that you start saying spicy unironically
---
The primary case is Creecher Virpio with for the 3 people reading it that have not figured it out the secondary case being Vily. 
---
Now a screenshot of the ticket would not be for you benefit but for other people reading this because i have absolutely 0 faith your gonna resolve this issue ( mainly because you originally handled this issue ) and apparently didn't feel it was important enough to remember. 
---
(given there are like 10 players a year in the position i would figure you would remember a behavior ticket about one of them with it being your job and all). 
---
Now the reason i want to screenshot it is because that way your response becomes public record and can be quoted in the future without me having to eat an account ban, giving you the ID just moves it into private circles where i'm already aware you personally are unwilling to take action without the spotlight of public opinion ( yeah i known you totally taken action you just can't talk about it and we never hear or see it again ).

ok, one time i made a bookmark at enterance, but when i wanted to return to highsec there was no hole there
---
LOL
---
Nobody disputed this, but nice story you made up there. 
---
Everyone just said "yeah, they'll do that, still easier to fuck with than local intel".
---
whats high sec? new player btw
---
But the workarounds are much less effective. OP describes exactly how in their post, and there are likely many other ways - including wormholes that completely circumvent the intel bots. You're completely missing the point. Botting as a money-making enterprise is now harder. I don't care how hard it is to write a bot that sits at a gate and issues commands to other bots based on some trigger. I care that botters will make less isk and lose more ships.
---
Later this week we will host a contest that I mentioned in the EVE Pulse Video. Name/Create a new vanity Item.

Now is your chance to provide the emotional reps that only Ice Cream can provide. Unless of course, you have another item idea in mind.

Or first party trying to GM wash the Plexes.

Gotcha well thank you for the reply! If I could I'd donate to get more security team broskis ❤️
---
Hha nice!
---
I have seen a few groups popping up here and there...I think with summer coming to and end things are picking up
---
Why don't long range Heavy fighters display how much bomb damage they do? Why doesn't the Shadow fighter display how much damage its suicide ability does? These don't show anywhere in game. It can only be extracted from game files.
---
"the logs show nothing"
---
NPC nullsec needs to be less accessible to non-bloc dudes just because cyno changes? Go fuck yourself.
---
Just look at the npc kills on dotlan, for those regions. The systems will light up like christmas trees.
---
The strategy would 100% be negated, all the enemy fleet has to do is to vary often which of their ship is closest to you and you'd end up spreading the damage while never focus firing. Alongside the dps cut, you'd honestly never really end up doing much.
---
In fleet v fleet fights (outside of major giant engagements), it is imperative to always focus fire on a single target, otherwise the enemy fleet will simply repair the damage you're doing over the whole fleet. For similarly sized fleets, you're usually trying to switch out aggro so the enemy fleet cannot outrepair you in time. If they could guarantee that you spread damage to multiple people in the fleet, then they'd always be able to heal in time.
---
I handle the pizza orders when we work late. Guess what you´re getting from now on?
---
Thank you everyone. Appreciate the responses!
---
Wow dude you can't tell an idiot he is wrong, he will get angry.
---
Well, the inside of the station is secure anyway.
---
Yep we do, multiple communication methods &amp; contingencies.
---
So for less time sensitive things, we have a daily standup where we go over anything new that needs to be communicated to every GM. We also have Slack &amp; e-mails for that kind of thing.
---
For something super time sensitive (i.e. server went down and is not coming back up level of stuff), we have contingencies in place where the relevant people needed to address the issue get a phone call.
---
Blue!

why?

---
hey, so with how the games meta is now, what will you guys do to help the sub-cap Ratter and smaller alliances? they have been hit the hardest by the changes, are barely out there which also removes a hunters reason to undock.
---
Never yet.
---
I always try to put myself on this person's place, whenever I can, whenever it's even an option. If I think that I am being too harsh or too strict, or too... something that I would personally would not like, I step back and try to think if I can do it differently. 
---
Sometimes I put smileys in tickets and replies :)
---
Well, maybe it wasn't that surprising... but that one time we "fixed the lag" with Time Dilation and then you guys brought a few thousand more people was interesting :D
---
But honestly, great question. I'm drawing a blank right now but I know there have been MANY instances of this kind of thing. I'll try to remember...
---
The secret of looting fast stays secret
---
I mean....I have no way out of this do i?
---
I don't have this info on hand as a hard metric that we track or anything like that, but I do remember one instance where we did replace an AT ship due to a verified bug.
---
Godbless Bastion
---
The Rokhs aren't cloaked during the tactic, they traditionally took a Titan bridge that was lit on the sabre at the edge of the drag bubble.
---
The rest is more or less accurate.
---
how to communicate with different language speakers?
---
Ohh Jesse, or do you indentify as Jessica? IDK doesn't matter...
---
Listen princess,
---
1. Skeleton crew isn't a renter - the guys that left you for us would of stayed in Fade with your botting renters if that was the case.
---
2. Faking battle reports is hilarious when you do so contradicting Darkness who keeps saving your ass. (For some reason)
---
3. We were not a Batphone. One of our spies in your alliance informed us of the timer and there were WHs directly to your pocket you just didn't notice?
---
4. Don't post on Reddit when you are so terrible at the game. Eventually Darkness will let you drown when you get in over your head
---
Lastly, @Darkness, thank you for the fun fight and content since Theran is incapable of defending themselves.
---
They don't need tech. The problem is that every single mmo company tries to automate it, and automating never works alone. They should really hire people to deal with them; a dedicated gm bot busting squad.
---
Ha nice, the lonely hero Minokawa ...
---
not a feature, but a fix.
---
I suppose that kind of depends; you might want to checkout "lutris" - its an easy to use wine-wrapper, which installs wine + eve + everything needed.  
---
Prior to that you need a working linux system with working internet, sound and 3d acceleration - should work on common hardware with one of the bigger distris.
---
Thanks for the insight, and I think its a good policy to be lenient at least on the first offense. I am biased though.
---
Are GM warnings cumulative? over the years I've gotten a lot, its at the point I'm afraid to talk in local as the next warning might be my last.
---
Do you roam in the game to support players or you support throught external program/ 4th dimension?
---
Thanks for your reply, i will happily consider eating you if i get the chance.
---
Just use TTT in perimeter
---
HTFU
---
So how many fights there are over this 'pvevp' content?
---
This Huginn guy seems really dapper. I will be sure to get a group picture with him for my tinder profile which i am currently working on.
---
You realize you are saying "My interest is only in EVE and not WoW, why isn't everyone else just like me?" - right?
---
Back in 2017, I fought on a TCU that was on a fucked up grid. The grid edge was about 100km off the TCU in one direction so the fleet could dodge fire by leaving the grid and coming back, and ships were getting split from logi by accident if they strayed too far.
---
It was the first and only experience I've had with grid fu, and as cool as it is in concept it feels more like being cheesed in practice.
---
Can confirm now. They are using the same tactic with procurers. Several procurers in belt surrounded by drones but as soon as u decloack they warp away.  [https://zkillboard.com/kill/78536958/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/78536958/)

That is some scary shit... That blop can drop a faction BB! --"

Mind that we can only support German and Russian apart from the regular English. But all you need to do is just submit a ticket in one of those languages and our GMs will help you for sure, using the language that you chose.
---
What is a killboard bomb/how does this work?
---
Unfortunately there is a major flaw in your line of thinking there. You are thinking of bots as players, which they are not. There may be a limit to how many accounts you or I can run efficiently, but botters aren't constrained by that.
---
When something reduces their income - whether it be a mechanics change the reduces the ISK earned, or something that increases the cost of doing business - they can simply increase their drone count to compensate. 
---
This change definitely reduced the ISK-per-bot value, but 10 bots at 100m/hr and 40 bots at 25m/hr end up yielding the same results.
---
Oh my my yes wont someone please think of the faction titans
---
Technically? They can use drones so I don’t see why you couldn’t....not efficient but doable
---
That is truly the worst idea I've seen all month.
---
Ahhaa Jup. Jumped my JF through a few invasion systems yesterday. Fastest 3 jumps I had.
---
At this point this whole conversation is fairly pointless I think. The replies we send out for offensive content reports are usually standard texts, so I doubt a screenshot would do any good here, but sure, feel free to take a screenshot and share it here if you feel the need.
---
It saddens me though that you ignoring or automatically discredit everything I say.  
---
And no, it's not about whether these cases are important enough to remember or not. As I mentioned somewhere here before, I'm in a committee handling most offensive content reports - this should tell you 2 very important things:
---
1. These decisions are not made by a single person.
---
2. I've seen a LOT, and I mean a LOT of similar cases. I may remember some, but come on...
---
Lol what?
---
Thanks Ill try and be there too. Incase we get lost in the Rain Forest.
---
and it's 2019... your fucking foul and pathetic language is a-fucking-trocious.  This is a fucking professional fucking forum and you shit it up with horseshit comments and words like that one in your second line....  get lost nerd.

Important Question... Thanatos VS Niddhog for  PVE ratting. Who wins

When is FW getting an income rebalance as well as citadel rebalance for fw space.

Not to mention rep changes with the diminishing reps (check the apostles, they had a shield rep), it helps a lot

Obviously this would never work, but the idea of bots being flung screaming into space still made me laugh
---
This isn't a stuka fleet
---
Hello GM team! I'm actually curious, in my own experience GM's tend to come from many walks of life before arriving where they are now. How did you all go about deciding to become GM's for Eve Online?  
---
And a secondary question, do you all live in Iceland or is there telecommuting for spacefriends who live in other countries? 
---
Thanks for doing the AMA!
---
you do know this is a pvp game and are talking about lowsec players right ?
---
i heard CCP gonna service on korean in this years and probaly mostly koreas cant speak english well.
---
if there is a certain percentage of Koreans, Is there a possibility that there will be additional Korean language staff?
---
Nice!
---
CCP is a good company.
---
get all your buddies to log off an alpha in their system. log on as a group every so often and get an easy kill.
---
That's how it should be ... many groups that are fighting everywhere :) like would be cool to see new groups every couple days and having a chance to fight them
---
First off, I'm all for making umbrellas more difficult to maintain. That seems like a legit design goal.
---
However, fleet fights with supers are already way too hard to get, and whoever is on field first already has a huge advantage.  This change does a pretty good job of growing that advantage.
---
You can't really warp to grid. Supercaps bump way too much to get aligned before you get bubbled, they are not mobile enough to just burn through bubbles or ping, and even if they do get into warp, you'll lend in defensive bubbles.  This is all true now, and will still be true after the change.
---
Next, you can't really just feed 50 recons/blops to just bring in supers 3 or 4 at a time. Basically, you'll end up just feeding 3 or 4 caps/supercaps at a time.  Also, I'm not sure anyone realizes this, but feeding a bunch of recons is kinda shitty gameplay.
---
Finally, the types of fights this change is intended to help is actually less affected then supercap fleet fights.  A superfleet is going to blap that 500k ehp widow everyone keeps throwing around as a solution even under fax reps.
---
However, your small roaming gang is going to have a hard time killing the same widow with a few schimis repping it.
---
So yeah, I do feel like maybe letting a capital class continue fitting cynos would be a good thing.  I wouldn't use a fax, just because it has some limited use in saving krabs.  I think maybe a dread would make sense because the only situation where a dread is used for krabbing is in wormholes, and they can't cyno there anyway.
---
But whatever. I've given up. It's collateral damage at this point.
---
Not my cup of tea for the 5 hours I get on to play for the week.
---
Damn skippy
---
But do you torpedobeat with it?
---
Fact.
---
They make more money from selling PLEX.
---
Those should bee NPC exclusive spawn but for completely different reasons different than your bullshit try-hard-bitching arguments.
---
Lol because CCP is controlling the bots, big surprise.
---
Can't answer #1 because I honestly don't know.
---
Regarding #2, I have to be clear that this is not an area I (or the GM team) works on currently. It's my understanding though that this all comes down to lack of internal tools. The old billboard system was super cool but all the work to get it into the game was manual. There was no automated pipeline to make this happen. What that meant is that the workload was getting insanely high for the poor soul in charge of this.

Sorry, english isn't my native language, is there a mistake there?
---
You didn't see that coming?
---
I have never flown a titan. I have no desire to do so.
---
I fly capitals but I cant see anything fun to do worth the price tag of any titan. I'd rather take the cash and buy smaller ships that are fun.
---
I've also never done an escalation of any level. It just doesn't interest me.
---
Market trading sinks isks by trading fees. Mission running actually generates.
---
Read the Hauling section at EVEUni's wiki, there is plenty of information, tips and even recommended fits for each indy hull.
---
I think even FCON had higher super and titan numbers than this.
---
Do you guys at CCP do luncheons where all the staff gather as a restaurant and have a lunch &amp; beer together before going back to work?
---
LEAST YOURE NOT USING CRUISE PHOONS ANYMORE YOU GUYS FED SO MUCH TO ASHER
---
Just curious... how many petitions have been raised against me?
---
WHO SAID YOU WERE A BRAINLESS MORON EXACTLY MORONS WITH A BRAIN
---
Confession time:
---
Before joining CCP, I did escrow system scams (this is pre-contracts).
---
My main go-to scam was selling fake bookmark sets for warp to 0 bookmarks. 
---
For those that don't know, this is before you could warp to zero, so you had to have bookmarks set up 15km behind each gate in a region in order to travel fast. I sold fake sets where none of the bookmarks were legit.
---
I've been a victim of that scam and it felt pretty crap, so yeah, that was kind of cruel! I'm sorry.
---
Did you just assume his grammar ?
---
Yeah, that was thing when we thought hell yeah we can finally make them pay with our full force!!...... they had the same idea.
---
I believe you, guess we are giving you hard time, when we change the rules of the game you make... Comes to my mind one change maybe.. What about change in carriers? Have you thought about we will start bashing citadels hard in way they couldnt defend themselves against fighter swarms?
---
I haven't personally seen this but yeah, I agree. I'd be surprised if there hadn't been an EVE player stationed there :)
---
I see you met your fate
---
this prompts my next question then, if you have never been in one, how do you know its not your cup of tea. you cant really base an opinion on hearsay
---
I personally became a GM many years ago when I saw an ad in the paper and immediately knew I had to apply. The gaming industry is not very big in Iceland and was pretty non-existent at the time.
---
We have a strong team here in Iceland but we also have an outsourcing partner, 5CA,  that has Work From Home GMs all over the world.
---
But acceleration gates?
---
They'd have to be wormholers btw.
---
Don't know about actual literal sweatshops, but yeah there's definitely been large scale botting in every continent (minus antarctica).
---
This analysis makes the most sense to me. All a change like this requires is a little bit of innovation and some changes to tactics, something I think is really interesting and exciting for eve.
---
Is he Bob?
---
&gt;This can be anywhere from button press frequency, timing, press hold (holding a key for x amount of time) and other variables.
---
Golly, and here I thought it was legal to call rand() as many times as you need to in your program.
---
&gt;Feel free to brush up on the subject before trying to be cute with ignorance.
---
Right back at'cha.

Well shit you're now banned from ever joining GOTG and Sort Dragon has you labeled as a racist.
---
But the blackout is great and me and my friend are having a blast humping mobile tractor units?
---
They are called shattered wormholes.
---
Oh but no local will stop botting and make goons cry! It will fix things!! Isn't that what the wormholers, ls/hs folks were saying? All I gotta say is the only way to stop botting is by using anti-cheat, back end script detection etc, anything else they will adapt to quite easily with a few more lines of code.
---
&gt; Those installations are spawning mostly in northern and western New Eden
---
uhm, the sotiyos mostly spawn in the north and east
---
&gt; TRYRM is recruiting
---
Sajuuk alts, you can't get away from them
---
I have just started exploring the game, how can I join your corp? Could use some guidance
---
How tedious it is to reimburse a player's ship?
---
they didn't die, they went into hibernation while they came up with patches for the bot scripts
---
I can answer how I came to be a GM. 
---
I was working overseas in the customer service industry (call centers, etc) for some major brands that you definitely have heard of. I started playing EVE in 2013, and with in a few months I was thrust into Corp leadership. Fast forward through most of the Brave coups, through meat shield alliances, and finally I connected with a corp that to this day, is one of the oldest still active corps in the game. 
---
Many of these guys happened to be Icelandic. After several years, I became the 'people guy' of the corp. I made it to Fanfest 2018 where i finally had a chance to meet some of my Icelandic friends. since most of my corp knew that I worked in the Cust Serv industry, one day, one of them linked the CCP careers page where a GM posting was listed. 
---
I said to my self, sure why not. The worst that could happen is a 'No Thanks' and im back to the Status Quo. Never in my life would I ever imagine my self living in any other place than the US or Latin America, and well, here I am. 
---
Being a GM is like the guy in the Matrix movies that stays in IRL (the operator?). Reading logs to figure out what you all are doing, is almost literally just like reading the Matrix, but not green lol. 
---
Best Decision Ive ever made hands down.
---
Well, kinda a long story but, when I very first started the game I wanted to be a space trucker. So I trained into an itteron IV and my brother and I joined a small-time corp effectively randomly selected from the recruitment channel. They were a fairly disorganized group and after being wardec'ed in the 24 hour window before fighting could start they decided to move everything to a new staging system. So, being mr space trucker I was eager to help. They passed me a pile of t1 frigates and their fittings but apparently my brother and one of the members got into some disagreement and friendly fire was on in corp so he blew up my Brother's ship, I think some t1 frigate, maybe destroyer... so I was like, fuck these guys, I've got 25 million worth of their stuff, I'm just gonna keep their stuff and run. So I unloaded one of the tristans put it together and let my brother use it to scout us away from the caravan. It felt fantastic to win like that, even for just 25 million which was at the time way more than either of us had. 
---
After that any Corp we would join would receive wardecs from small time mercenary groups paid for by the dudes we had stolen from. So we kept getting kicked from the mid-sized noobish corps we were joining because the leaders of the former Corp would email the new Corp and tell them why they were being wardec'ed which of course included true but incomplete details about our theft. 
---
So we made our own corporation together and fucked off into a c1 WH with a lowsec static and eventually the wardecs stopped. Turned out we had a taste for piracy and ended up pulling off a lot of lowsec ransoms and commandeering of ships, at one point I had a personal collection of 4 commandeered orcas. We ran lots of long term con jobs on dumb alliances and corps including "renting" lowsec space that we didn't own. We realized that we didn't care for any of the PVE content when there was so much money to make by attacking other people. That corp is now like 9 years old and ranked fairly high in Zkill stats and I wouldn't change a thing. Thank goodness that dude awoxed my Brother's ship or I may have ended up shooting red boxes as if I had a life that could not be wasted.
---
It is an amazing company to work for, that's for sure &lt;3
---
weren't goku's the bombless fit from back in the day? i remember when PGL rolled out the comp (N3 days i believe), don't think we had bomb launchers.
---
You can’t move much with a T1 hauler before it’s worthwhile to kill you for loot or salt. Like, less than 100m.
---
I recommend training into a DST asap to upscale if you care about trading / hauling. However, you’d probably make more isk overall by seeding a pvp corps market with ships.
---
Wormholes don't have asset safety. So WH'ers (see Inner Hel and a few others) have started offering services to charge for killboard bombs. There's no asset safety in WHs, so they deliver fitted ships into a cheap Raitaru (usually Ventures of Probes) to anyone in game they want to harass. Then on unanchor, they just run around mowing down frigates with smartbombs. See the warning on my killboard? /u/Squizz added that recently. The same was done to Hedliner, Vily, PGL, XiX lead FC, KillahBee and others. I was online when my notifications started piling in, and it literally froze the client.
---
I know I don't like:
---
- relying on other people for my safety
---
-hitting d-scan every few seconds
---
- logging in only to find the station I was in gone
---
As seen above I am an irregular, casual at best player.
---
CCP GM's are ypu having too much fun flying around New Eden? You havent bothered to respond in any kind to my support ticket from last thursday.
---
They are cumulative and never expire.
---
HOWEVER, we have an internal policy for offensive language warnings specifically, where old warnings are ignored after a certain point in time, unless they were incredibly toxic (think super racist level stuff).
---
I've often thought it would be fantastic to get a better warning system which is more transparent on the player side. Something like a small box on account management where you can see your current standing. Just a pipe dream right now, but yeah, I'd love that...
---
If we implement something like that in the future, I'd love to do a complete reset on "low severity" warnings, like mildly offensive language stuff.
---
I don't think you really need to worry about talking in local, but don't say anything racist or otherwise super toxic :)
---
Well until there’s a counter

there isn’t

Can't really answer that, I am afraid :/ We don't do game balance, that would be a different dev team. We get lots of suggestions from players, we get some reports, that we forward to dev teams, but we don't comment balance itself.

Why has /u/CCP_Archduke not changed his name yet?! Drunken promises must be upheld, friends.
---
Try it ?
---
Depends.  
---
the correct answer to your question is Yes and No.
---
What kind of elves are we talking about  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Nice now you get the idea
---
&gt;That's why I said the requirements can be fuzzy, like WOW flex queue. Run with 17-23 or whatever. Could also be smaller "sites" you run with 5 with the big group sites only spawning in low trusec constellations. Ex, a -0.7 average constellation spawns a 20 and a 5, a -0.4 spawns a 10 and a 5, a -0.1 only spawns a 5. Or even tie it to system upgrades so you can set the spawn to be whatever size up to the trusec limit.
---
Again, you keep trying to deal with a situation where you have very few players.
---
I'm talking about a situation where you have a lot of players.  That's what's going on in the blocs, and that's why there's a queue.  You don't need a formal queue system if you just need to gather a small number of players.
---
&gt;What I said was that each site runs for about 5 minutes, similar to a dread siege cycle or industrial core cycle. After that, the group gates to the next site to continue running until they hit the "payout" escalation. 
---
Yes, and you have yet to notice the problem that if I leave after one site, I don't get the "payout".
---
Again, bloc situation.  There's a formal queue.  If I leave, I don't "catch up", I go to the back of the queue.
---
&gt;That already happens in incursions, groups tip their logi/fc in order to compensate them or risk being blacklisted. 
---
Yes, but the logi/fc can't be easily replaced by someone's alt on another screen.
---
Also, you're forgetting that "you can just beg for tips to sit there and stare at an acceleration gate" is not exactly compelling.
---
Eve already has shitty PvE.  No need to tell people to stare at their screens doing nothing to make it even worse.
---
Also, you've forgotten in all this back-and-forth that your solution isn't hard to bot.  They've already botted super ratting and exploration.  Mini-incursions are even simpler.
---
The people that make the most isk in NS dont have low SP. And the very fact that WHs only hold a couple of procent of the population means that the isk/capita is insanely broken there. In comparison NS spreads the wealth far more and in doing so actually helps out newer players.
---
WH faucets shouldnt even come close to what NS is making due to those factors.
---
Surely it's real players just watching the gate 23/7.... don't make such a bold assumption  /sarcasm
---
As GM's, do you get any perks when playing?
---
I mean, we have a cafeteria (cantina) where lunch is served every day and we all have lunch at the same time, but no beer, that happens after work. Drinking on the job is a no no.

It's always good to report it in tickets. I would recommend to include such information as: who has issued the contract, who has accepted it, and that's about it, I guess. The ticket will most likely end up with a special team and it will be investigated thoroughly. 
---
And about the secondary question... I can neither confirm, nor deny... But check out GM Lelouch's stance on Cosmos missions:

---
Nice.
---
Using an anti-cheat to catch players who breach the boundaries set by the developers is one thing, catching bots that are operating within those set boundaries is something else entirely.
---
I guess it should be "found"??
---
There was a ticket recently where the player insisted to have his ticket escalated to the highest possible level. 
---
Eventually it got into my hands and it turned out the player just wanted a manager to hear about the awesome job the frontline GM who handled the ticket originally had done solving his issue.
---
That was a really nice thing to do and it made our day!
---
T2 cap rigs, 2-3 armor reppers (you can splurge a bit on these), armor hardener for whatever your fighting (optional), drone damage amps, an AB in your mid along with cap modules, and that's about it. Toss a Sister's Scan Probe Launcher on there and slap some RSS probes in and you're good to go. Or you could buy Sisters probes I guess, if you're a peasant.
---
A downvote for suggesting a positive change to the game to fix the issue you are having? Alrighty mate.
---
They definitely need work, and I think they'd be great. Tweak them to hunt drones or go after pointers, webbers, ewar.. . A small FoF fleet along side a bigger fleet could be useful. Just need a better aggro system for fleets.
---
I recall a story from an ex-wow GM, where the GM in question had accidentally deleted one of the main cities on one of the servers through an odd bug. Has an EVE GM ever accidentally broken something in eve in an equally catastrophic way? IE - deleting a gate, station, or citadel?
---
Basically, what's the Eve GM equivalent of accidentally hitting "Jump to" instead of "Bridge to"?
---
Thanks!
---
When on my GM account, I kinda have like ALL the powers lol.   
---
When on one of my personal accounts, I am a mere mortal like you. We get no special treatment as players.

LOL I even remember a GM submitting a ticket to get a ship loss reimbursed. As players, we sit right next you in that fox hole.

this is r/eve, everything gets downvoted that doesnt fit the preferred narrative of the day

&gt;allowing c4 corps to cap blob with impunity (atleast until a larger group catches wind of it).

Can confirm. Old c4 Corp was building caps to use in the hole only to get an eviction threat and move out.
---
Not like Legolas :D Fairies, feys and such &lt;3
---
Is that so?!
---
&gt; Nobody cares that you can't rat mindlessly and generate passive wealth while watching Netflix.
---
Yes they do because all this isk devalues the isk I make from legitimate ratting (or exploration or whatever, to some degree).
---
Thank you

What is your alliances/corps' time zone?

As long as you can drop it in high sec you can get a full load moved to a hub for next to nothing. Some people really seem to like space truck simulator.

---
See if you'd said that bit about Plex earlier I think we wouldn't have even had a super left to smash this week.
---
But us nerds in Africa are supposed to be so well behaved xD
---
Shield/missile ships are usually best. I ran a Cerb for quite a while, and it could handle 5 and 6/10s. Tengu might be better, but I never used it even back before the changes. I don't remember my Cerb fit, but mess around with passive shield regen in the fitting tool. I think for lowsec DEDs, you want a regen rate of around 90-120. Obviously the higher the better. And try to keep your sig down, so use an AB instead of an MWD. On top of that, when you're running sites (Guristas only) kill the BC rats first because they can hit you hardest.
---
I don't know how to do any DEDs other than Guristas, so you're on your own if you go anywhere besides State Lowsec.
---
That's a good one - I honestly don't know if that's been on anyone's mind. I'll mention it to one of the EVE Dev producers next time I see them :)
---
We should definitely host an mspaint competition for next year's GM Week. :)
---
Do we have to just FIND you guys or actually seek&amp;destroy?  Should i hunt with my Instawarp roamy-ceptor
---
&gt; but botters aren't constrained by that.
---
They absolutely are. There are only so many systems that can reasonably support profitable botting when they have to put one alpha account on each gate. That means at least 1, often 2-4 additional accounts/VMs running _per system_ to generate the same amount of revenue. Hardware limitations are a thing. Mar5hy talks pretty extensively about what it takes for him to run a relatively large number of accounts, and it's not trivial. Your average botter is not going to spin up 25-35% more accounts on a whim to get the same isk/hr, and they definitely will not use the previously most profitable anom ratting bots. 
---
Of course botting isn't going away, but anyone who thinks that this didn't hurt botting at all is misguided.
---
&gt; Plex has dropped a good bit in price since blackout came on, so the value of isk has gone up. That is a net good for real players.
---
And also just means that those who are back to botting are going to be even more effective.
---
It's racism to say that all Chinese people are botters.
---
"We're not shutting you down because you're a jerk; we're shutting you down because you're going to crash the server."
---
This guys trust in rust.
---
not a native speaker either, but i think you meant, "ship found".
---
It's not a stuka fleet though. There's more thought put into this in terms of anti fighters and void bomb pressure for nuking caps. Yes, they are similar in terms of the mainline being bombers with torps, but calling them the same is like saying a legacy (not the group, the term) Drake fleet is the same as a modern jackdaw fleet because they both use missiles, range, and anchoring.
---
Half a year ago was before the 64bit client when it couldn't utilize any of the capabilities of newer multi core CPU's. Also I wouldn't be surprised if some of the recent windows updates in the 6 month time frame were for the intel vuln issues that would have decreased performance.
---
I had an overclocked i5 until 2 weeks ago and had all the same issues as everyone was stating here. High CPU usage, video on chrome stuttering on my second monitor. Just upgraded to the new 3900x cause it was driving me crazy and now 4 eve clients run at 20% cpu with 10+ chrome tabs and no video stutter.
---
Maybe CCP patched something, maybe Windows patched something but everything improved dramatically once I got my new CPU.
---
Are lvl4s doable in a jackdaw? I guess you just have to headshot the one guy and they warp fast so that makes sense...
---
We´re having fun for sure but we´ve also responded to hundreds of support tickets since last Thursday. Do you have a ticket in the queue that hasn´t gotten a reply? If you give me a ticket ID, I´ll look into that for you!
---
Go with friends / corp mates. Otherwise you'll feel a little lost. In the other hand you can probably make friends there if you're a social extrovert.
---
&gt; Using workarounds that are so obvious we have literally been talking about them in "remove local" threads for years.
---
And which are still far less effective than local.
---
A gate watcher, even if it has perfect attention (which a bot will), can't see you log in or out in the system. It can't see who jumps in through a wormhole.
---
&gt; When something reduces their income - whether it be a mechanics change that reduces the ISK earned, or something that increases the cost of doing business - they can simply increase their drone count to compensate.
---
&gt; This change definitely reduced the ISK-per-bot value, but 10 bots at 100m/hr and 40 bots at 25m/hr end up yielding the same results.
---
If someone was capable of running 40 bots then why weren't they running 40 before?
---
I've gone to the last two EVE events that I could. I had great fun. I am currently balancing that against the fact there will be CCP staff that direct from a dev's mouth don't care how the player base feels anymore. (I'm not arguing or debating business practices, just mindful of now actively deciding to hang out with people that give no fucks about input or discussion.)
---
It doesn't really matter at that level.
---
Think of the t2 industrials and freighter you would want and go that way.
---
O think the caldari industrials look the best and then the Providence for freighters.
---
I go off looks
---
That's a pretty amazing journey! Thanks for sharing :D Really highlights how life can take you some pretty strange places sometimes!

One fax is all you need.

They can say the same to you. Everyone that isn't a CCP employee has only feelycraft regarding bots. There's no hard evidence, no matter how many times you see them warp off instantly lmfao.

War has changed.
---
It's no longer about nations, ideologies, or ethnicity. It's an endless series of proxy battles, fought by mercenaries and machines.
---
War--and it's consumption of life--has become a well-oiled machine.
---
Did... you... perhaps ganked people with a small-gang of Falcons/ECM Fun\_and\_balanced ships ? :P
---
Wow .... only different by an entire order of magnitude. :P
---
OMG that would be awfsome.
---
I do like mustard on a pizza though...
---
I've thought of doing something like this. Would a T3 be more viable than a Stratios?
---
&gt; If bots are pressing F how can you tell the difference between a player pressing F? Bots can just set to press F at random delayed intervals to look like a player then.
---
Kind of answered your own question there. Real players' interactions will have a distribution of when they press F that you can compare with. It won't be as simple as random uniform.
---
Oh dear... Yeah there have definitely been things like that. I think almost every GM will have a "war story" of some sort :)
---
Mine is that while fixing some kind of issue with a Starbase, instead of giving a Starbase full hitpoints, I accidentally gave it 0 hitpoints... which made it blow up.
---
This was pre-Dominion sovereignty mechanics, so it was a bigger deal than you'd think, since Starbases were what claimed sovereignty.
---
Ended up staying in the office for something like four hours past my shift in order to put up a new Starbase for the poor victim &amp; sorting out all the complications.
---
There's a famous example from wayyy back in the day where a GM accidentally moved a solar system inside the cargo hold of a ship... that was inside that very same solar system. It crashed the node. Tools were updated to make it impossible for GMs to move solar systems after this happened :)
---
This is in fact not correct. Value of isk is dependant of many factors of which PLEX is only one. Prices on everything else have gone up so using PLEX as a basis for actual purchasing power isnt viable.
---
None of that matters one bit. Dont wanna be that guy but botting is more a yes/no thing than how much thing. Especially since you cant measure the amount of botting, its just anecdotal evidence based on assumptions.
---
Still the same point as above. Assumptions. Im fairly certain most bots are in HS now, like they have been for quite some time. What we dont know wont hurt us?
---
Not an issue, if the cost goes up across the board then the buyer will cover those costs, just like with any other product.
---
I dont mean to be dismissive but botting should never be our concern for anything. Thats CCPs issue, not ours. As long as people are willing to pay for isk, which people will always be willing to do, there is nothing that can be done about botting. Thats why no society has ever been able to eradicate criminal activities.
---
I've done every major playstyle, aside from serious capital stuff.
---
I have 2 capital pilots and have done wormhole stuff back when carriers and Dre escalated wormhole stuff.
---
I've lost jump freighters, and blops, and capitals all over.
---
Done nullsec life as a renter and as a coalition member, faction warfare, wormholes, npsi, hauling, mining, highsec nonsense, ganking, iosec wardecs, ded site running, missions, manufacturing, etc.
---
The list of things I haven't done would be very specific, like I haven't pipebombed anyone.
---
:D I got called an idiot plenty of times when I said this will happen
---
Sounds like daytripping is for you.
---
You'll have just to find us :D Please don't destroy us, we'll surrender loot just like that :) 
---
We will continue the hunt tomorrow, but keep an eye on the help channel.
---
&gt; I don't think you understand the word random.
---
No, I think it's you that doesn't. Human interactions will almost never result in a purely random distribution of a neat mathematical form (uniform, normal etc), such as you'd produce from writing a bot using rand() or similar.
---
Sorry, I am kind out of the game for the moment.  
---
EVE impared if you will.   
---
Looks like people had fun  :)
---
I came to one of the earliest Fanfests as a player. Fell in love, submitted my CV :) A few months later I got onboarded and the rest is history!
---
'Look outside' is a pretty dumb way to do it but they could certainly use a cloaked ship at a perch on the gate.
---
Can confirm, Tolls wont let me put Jita inside a container.
---
No thanks. The changes are good how they are proposed already.
---
Morbid and inventive, so good in that sense, but you might want to just use a bookmark since anyone can use a floating corpse to warp to, making that place not really "safe".
---
If there was one bug you'd like to see forever gone from EVE, what would it be?

That's a very nice planet in the background
---
Almost all support is done with external programs. We use Zendesk to handle tickets, and a homegrown browser-based tool to interact with the game world.
---
There are a handful of issues which require us to go in-game to solve, but they're very few and far between these days! If you see us in-game, it's likely to not be due to a ticket, but because we are jumping into the help channels or something like that to assist.
---
Not exactly the answer to your question, but I just wanted to share: when I just started working in CCP, they showed me the system we are working in and OH MY GOD, I was terrified to do a wrong move. So many buttons, so many options, so many choices. 
---
They also could look similar, sometimes the tiny button that was easy accessible could have caused the massive destruction or just very bad circumstances and I was absolutely terrified to do something wrong. 
---
Now? Well... it's been a couple of years and some buttons still scare me. It's important not to show it though, they feel your fear.
---
Without promising anything, there is always a possibility if the region is large enough. We have supported a few other languages than English, German and Russian in the past but it turned out that there wasn't enough demand for support in those languages for us to keep offering it. 
---
One language in particular has only 24 tickets submitted in a whole year before we dropped it!
---
Because botting is a business. You adapt your business based on demand. If you dont sell 1 trillion isk/month then why would you configure it for that amount? Especially since each botted character has a shelf life.
---
Put up ESIs and just steal their mone
---
Where is the MER?

Part of the reason rr's rags did a bit poorly was that they were lacking the dual tank - especially with deadco armor fax numbers available to support.

Might have saved one or two. Might not.

TIL: Zerg rushing recons is skill.
---
maybe I'm more of a 1337 DVDer then I give myself credit for.

Afraid this is a question only a developer can answer.
---
higher staff/admin tags look best in pink just saying. personal experience
---
You could just have logged of before. Its not like it was ever hard to catch bots if you really wanted to.
---
I'm not after the Sotiyos. What possible use is NPC null to anyone small gang/pve if there are a million prestaged recons ready to cyno powerbloc cap fleets in? Fuck that cancer.
---
&gt; The rest i don't ~~care~~ *know* enough to even argue about.
---
You are always welcome to edit our wiki too. You can do it under pseudonyms if you wish to keep CCP names away from fan sites.
---
Sotiyos suck. 
---
I wish CCP would just add faction capital BPCs to their pirates’ respective LP stores and set the build requirements similar to those of the Serpentis caps to keep proliferation down. Sotiyos aren’t fun and they don’t create the content CCP intended. They’re either cheesed or completely ignored. When they do get run, they rarely drop anything of significant value. 
---
That being said, I’d much rather CCP use faction capital BPCs as a desirable ISK sink. Having astronomical build requirements as a gatekeeping mechanic seems to be effective. Take the Vanquisher for example, even though you can get the print from an LP store, you don’t see many of them. Their 230b price tag keeps them rare. Just as a matter of opinion, I prefer reward systems with a clear progression, even if the effort required to get your reward is extreme. A dedicated player with alts or a group of coordinating players could construct a Vanquisher as a lofty goal - not so much with the Molok or Komodo. Besides, all the recent balance passes make factional capitals more vulnerable. I would bet that this trend will only continue with forthcoming changes. 
---
CCP please give us a more rewarding and clear path to acquiring faction capital BPCs. There’s a great opportunity here for an ISK sync and a lucrative content driver in nullsec that more that a handful can participate in.
---
You can use it all you want, the more data a bot gives the more you have to find a pattern regardless of how many calls you make for random. Unless every action is perfectly random you will always be able to find the bot. The trick is making it efficient enough to look for them in the first place.
---
:sniff sniff:  
---
Whats that I smell?  .....fear
---
Aw, well I guess your problem is something else then, sorry fam :(
---
How would anyone be posting here afterwards
---
I mean it happens. I got stuck running the same minor for an hour because i kept getting random  large spawns
---
&gt; Also, you've forgotten in all this back-and-forth that your solution isn't hard to bot. They've already botted super ratting and exploration. Mini-incursions are even simpler.
---
The difference is that super ratting and exploration don't have built in tackle that makes catching them easier. Rorquals for example, are not usually botted because rorquals have to be in industrial core mode to be the most effective, and industrial core self-tackles the rorqual. The safety for Rorquals comes from PANIC making them easy to save, rather than being aligned and instawarping like ratting supers. If ratting supers needed to self tackle for 5 minutes, they'd die in vast numbers because they are tougher to save compared to human pilots supers.
---
That's why I proposed the infinite point for the site. You can bot the mini-incursion sites, but they'll die like flies because they'll be tackled and nobody is coming to save them when lokis start landing on grid.
---
Why would someone fly a titan for a group without SRP? Seems pretty crazy to me.
---
You are not the button though &lt;3
---
I remember having an irrational fear of stacking modules of the same type too when just starting out, but as you say, it's absolutely worth it and sometimes essential.
---
it's pretty obvious when you guys broadcast a thread / comment to react to / downvote b/c my remark will go unnoticed until a certain point then 5 of you nerds will comment at the same time.
---
Why don't you start a new alliance in stain? vOv
---
No he does not  kane had a bigger and better beard and way more charm
---
But that guy had lots of hair
---
You're still thinking about it *player* terms. What Mar5hy - and other *players* like him - do is precisely nothing like what bots do, so the comparison there is flawed at a base level.
---
For botters it's the RL money they generate from RMT sales and such that matters. So ISK/hr is only a factor in their calculations, which also includes things like hardware resources and PLEX. The ISK itself is only an intermediary they need in order to cash in their RL payday.
---
So if maintaining their income requires them to upgrade or add to their hardware, there's no doubt they'll do that. From their perspective it's basically just a one-off business expense.
---
&gt;There are only so many systems that can reasonably support profitable botting when they have to put one alpha account on each gate.
---
There's plenty of space available. There are also a LOT of pockets and corridors all over null-sec where 2-3 systems sit behind 1 or 2 gates. It's not always necessary to have eyes on *every* gate. And with sub-cap ratters, even a WH spawn in a system will have a limited effect. They'll be aware of you the moment the first Myrmadon gets tackled, and the rest will dock up immediately.
---
This is all based on your assumption that they didnt relocate. And are sitting in HS safer than ever before. THe blackout basically gave bots invincibility, not the other way around. As long as they were in NS you could track movements and report. Who really cares enough about HS to do the same?
---
Hrm...
---
I've never, ever wardecced anyone. I've mentioned this before but I always had this romantic idea of making an alt corp and just wardeccing random highsec groups and being a classic pirate, holding them for ransom, and whatnot...but it's a whole lot of effort that I don't want to put in.
---
Just wanted to say thanks for that one time I thought I jumped but I guess I didnt and you replaced my ship.  It's too bad I'm a fucking wack job though and still pissed off about the 1 mil SP from the shit ass anniversary event.  On the other hand, GTA5 has been A LOT of fun.
---
Thank you ccp now i have nightmares    
---
I just heard some noice from the closet
---
I don't see a Titan fight :( just some Titans demolishing some poor dreads.
---
Hi GM Fate, thank you for the reply.
---
Original ticket from Thursday - 948318
---
Thank you.
---
You've made me really curious... a bit far to just drive there and pop in, but yeah. I hope we can solve this mystery!
---
I'm not French! Just from little Iceland :)
---
The blackout wasnt due to faucets, CCP Rise said that much. The faucets were pretty much in check prior to the blackout and are actually too low now and need readjusting after it.
---
&gt;Unless every action is perfectly random you will always be able to find the bot.
---
Only when there is a sufficiently large number of behavioral options available to the player.  Like in a FPS, the route the player takes through the map can be a good indicator because a human's will vary significantly (even while following the same general path) and a bot's will only vary a little to avoid getting lost.
---
But Eve doesn't provide that many options to the player.  It's not like there's an infinite number of ways to hit "F", only the difference in timing.  Which is easy to cover with rand() calls.
---
What's wrong with enjoying the game the way you like it?
---
&gt;I dont mean to be dismissive but botting should never be our concern for anything.
---
This entire thread is about botting.
---
Imagine thinking you're worth brigading 😂😂😂😂
---
You're downvoted relentlessly because you're a fucking moron, not because people are following you.
---
There's a lot to be said for training Gallente haulers. They have more specialized T1s than anybody else, and the most useful. I think the Iteron V is still the most m^3 when fitted for max cargo. 
---
Looking down the road (a long way) Caldari have the edge in freighter and JF cargo capacity.
---
It's the best!
---
Does CCP run bots in their game?
---
:facepalm:
---
Can we have a little tutorial on the overview? Something that lets them grab your version of Z-S and maybe shows some screenshots of how players arrange their windows?
---
I think the goal was to have these be rare, not accessible to anyone who grinds
---
As long as they only affect normal cynos and leave covert cynos as it is ? drasticaly changing the pendel towards covert gangs...
---
Don’t ever stop these please. ❤️
---
Never flew a cap and never will.  Something about taking 10 years to align and warp to things, pretty much forced to have a 2nd account for cynos, high investments that make you forced to log on and play due to sunk cost fallacy.  
---
I just like to keep things cruiser and below for faster pace plays.
---
Do Eve players play from Antarctica?
---
Has Gomez misplaced his brother again.
---
Lost my first VNI there.
---
I apologize I couldn’t fit your narrative today. 
---
Let’s all just press F1 together. Free supers for everyone! Injectors all round! Rorquals and MCT by the dozen!
---
So we should just give up and do nothing?
---
&gt;The difference is that super ratting and exploration don't have built in self tackle that makes catching them easier.
---
Catching them is already trivial.  A logon trap will do it &gt;95% of the time.  People don't do it because it's boring, and botters currently have no need to adapt because so few are doing it.
---
&gt;Rorquals for example, are not usually botted because rorquals have to be in industrial core mode to be the most effective, and industrial core self-tackles the rorqual
---
Rorquals are botted.  It's just not that easy to tell the difference between a bot and a 'start the excavators and netflix' player, so you're assuming the latter.
---
&gt;Hence why botting supers are lightly tanked and have 3 sebos, whereas humans supers use NSA and a heavy tank.
---
Uh....no.  Dumb human players use an NSA when ratting, thanks to the blackout.  And there's plenty of human-piloted hyperspacial hels and nyxes dying, just like always.
---
&gt;You can bot the mini-incursion sites, but they'll die like flies because they'll be tackled
---
Guess what happens with current bots about 30 minutes after you anchor a bubble and log off?  Guess who aren't dying like flies because of this?
---
...did you miss the opponents also dropping titans?
---
I went for the first time after playing for almost 10 years. 
---
Had a great time. It's great to talk to strangers about my long and storied eve career.
---
10/10 reccomend and if you go I'll see you there
---
You can. But you can also do them in groups
---
You gotta admit that’s brilliant though. Surprised no one got to it before I did. 😁
---
Who's narrative? I am a GSF member. Why would I be grr Goons?
---
Dope video tbh
---
Deviant automata too stronk
---
Thx, knew we didn't ping for it, didn't realize it was just 1 guy.
---
I just see a retard :(
---
Last year when they introduced jump gates they were going to allow supers to go through without fatigue. 
---
A very persistent and loud group of people hounded several dev's saying it's a bad idea. 
---
I spent half an hour with CCP rise he told me it wasnt his department i tell him "your the balance guy this is horribly unbalanced, if this goes through you might aswell drop all jump fatigue"
---
When the gates came out, supers were allowed through them. Someone listened
---
We have to let this one play out. Seems we are at the whims of reddit nowadays and these people wont accept anything that goes against their narrative even if the game breaks. Lets just hope CCP does.
---
Man at least GOTG used them in combat
---
Yea Jagex has a great system that shows your standing and past offenses. 
---
I work professionally as a software developer, and I write a lot of the tools my alliance uses.
---
If you gave me my own data, or sample data I could write that for free, for some expungement.
---
I believe we unofficially retired the PINKTEXT role when Punkturis left.
---
Its easy to do crack but not everyone does it. Could there perhaps be a not so hidden factor, like people simply dont wanna do it?
---
I think he's referring to a patch in 2007(ish) CCP released which deleted the boot.ini file on any computer running Vista.
---
Then your anti-cheat is utterly useless, instead of completely useless.
---
Nice video! Here are some pointers:
---
1. You are often cycling your SAAR too late. This is most evident during the Comet fights - I'll wager that those losses ended with some paste left in your SAAR. Remember that armor reps land at the end of a cycle. The HP from nanite-bonused SAAR cycles you see on Pyfa is irrelevant if you don't get every one of those cycles off. The Tormentor doesn't have the best buffer, and blaster ships in particular are certainly able to blow past the EHP/s repaired by an SAAR, so if you start your SAAR cycling too late then you'll find yourself bleeding into hull. Consider starting your first SAAR cycle when you still have a substantial amount of armor left - against a blaster ship, I would say maybe when you first get to armor, or even earlier (against a Catalyst for example that SAAR is cycling more or less as soon as I get locked).
---
2. Others have commented on this. Don't forget to overheat! You can pre-heat modules before activating them. Also, I would strongly recommend using hotkeys for your modules. I personally remapped all of my module hotkeys and also mapped overheat hotkeys. Similarly you should consider mapping hotkeys for your drone commands if you haven't done so already. Overheating your AB in particular could have helped you last longer against some of the Comets.
---
3. My understanding is that in a Tormentor, often it is better to keep at range than orbit (and manual piloting is superior to both). Lasers have poor tracking, especially compared to blasters.
---
4. Against the Tristan you fought after the Comet, there was actually a little bit toward the end where you were not pointed/scrammed. If you're in a losing fight you should consider aligning to a celestial. There's always a (actually pretty decent) chance that your opponent will lose point for some reason, especially if you can combine this with some sort of slingshot maneuver.
---
5. Staying on your wrecks overview can be a dangerous thing. There's a real danger of accidentally locking a wreck or a drone. I suggest working with a few different overview tabs: one that exclusively shows ships and important warpable locations, and one that exclusively shows drones. The latter is useful against Tristans in particular; in some of your fights you start with a Tristan at range, and you want to have the option to remove his drone damage from the field.
---
6. Other than that you want to generally raise the speed at which you do things, which comes with practice. One useful thing, if you press your hotkeys for your offensive modules and then click on an enemy, you will initiate the locking process and your modules will activate the moment you get the lock. In particular this will let you immediately apply your webs, which is extremely important for range dictation. You also generally want your AB active immediately upon entering the plex, probably preheated, and get your ship moving right away, as range dictation is of the utmost importance in frigate fights (and for Tormentors especially). The first few seconds often completely dictate the outcome of a frigate fight, so it's paramount that you get them right.
---
Thanks! It was great not having TiDi.
---
Because it's harder than living in null sec.
---
of course issues will resolve with upgrades but that mindset is kinda dumb to begin with. if things were working just fine for i dont know how long and than 1 patch hits and things go down the issue is not the users hardware and devs should work on resolving the issue. buying something that is way overpowerd for the application just to avoid the issue is a pretty weird way of solving problems. its like : "yeah i could stop eating mcdonalds every day because thats the issue but... nah i just pay for the doctor. my issues will be gone then you know"  its like brute forcing your way to avoid the issue but that isnt resolving the issue. And not everyone wants to buy a new system for every issue occuring if their systems are actually pretty fine for everything they do.
---
Do we really need asshouses or, actually, any citadels to be on grid with gates?
---
&gt; Read your comment history. I understand now. Internet reee being internet reee. 
---
I am honoured that you felt I was important enough to bother reading through my leavings.
---
wormholer btw
---
Worth doing at least once if you have a lot of corp/alliance mates also going, and you have the money to spare.
---
You're in danger.
---
No idea if any of these tickets mentioned you specifically, but we've had 16 tickets about this particular thing as far as I can tell (based on a rough keyword search)!
---
Is it as greatly reduced as legitimate human ratting though? It could be that it ends up making bot isk generation larger as a percentage of all isk generated. Reduced human ratting could also increase demand of RMT isk buying and that isk will be worth more with less isk in the game as before. 
---
CCP needs to git gud at database queries for obvious things that would show bots.
---
Did you fuck up the fax drop? around 3 minutes
---
Nobody is suggesting we do nothing. And it's extremely crappy how people keep accusing others of advocating for that just because we don't think a specific thing is going to work.  - There's a big difference between: *"this idea won't work"* and *"nothing will work, just give up"*.
---
Correct. If you ran EVE as an administrator, which most people did.
---
&gt;it's impossible to account for wormholes
---
There's not that many wormholes.  Those losses are massively dwarfed by all the ticks when a wormhole isn't present.
---
&gt;and people logging off
---
Not that hard to bot using a locator agent.
---
/u/ccp_falcon when are you gonna grow that old timey villain handlebar moustache?
---
But can't you confirm ownership through other means? The victim can supply the credit card used to sub the account, you can check IPs, correlate online time with known alt accounts that haven't been compromised, etc.
---
Hmm, not really a bug... but my personal pet peeve is the direct trade system. I want to see it modernized.
---
It feels SO dated compared to other games, which is probably no big surprise, since it's a very old system that was created before most of the other games even existed!
---
Never lived out of a cloaky orca in a shattered wormhole.
---
I want to do it before I finally quit
---
Maybe there was a minor miscommunication :honk:
---
Well instead of "May Bob have mercy" you could also write "rush to jump back through wormhole" but that only always works if the other side highsec though.
---
Ehh caps can align in 10s with a 500mn and the right fits.
---
But subs are way way more fun
---
If your character name is the same as your reddit handle... then I'm not seeing a single one filed against you!
---
Well, at least a keyword search for your name turned up no tickets other than those you've filed yourself!
---
&gt;If someone was capable of running 40 bots then why weren't they running 40 before?
---
Cost.
---
They need more hardware to run 40 than to run 10.  If you make them have to run 40 to RMT enough to eat, they're gonna add more hardware.
---
I don't shoot newbies, and I don't shoot indy stuff unless it's from an actual enemy. 
---
I just don't see it as honorable or at the very lest leet to pick on the lowest hanging fruit. 
---
Oh and killboard green btw
---
Never owned a rorq. Although I'm tempted now, seen a few fairly cheap.
---
According to this place, I should have injected at least 6 by now. I'm sorry to have let u down r/eve
---
Syndicate. It was sooo fun back in the day. Maybe it's still fun, I dunno, but you could always get good fights there.
---
To have fun?
---
Just reimbursing a ship is a single button... But finding out if we \*should\* reimburse the ship can take a lot of button presses &amp; reading!
---
Hics are good for the game what? 
---
If someone crits their holes in an eviction scenario then you'd have to suicide roll it without hics. 
---
You can also troll bears and roll their crit holes and force them to stop a site and reship. 
---
Also gives you more holes to to kill nerds with
---
&gt;faggot fanbois
---
Cringe.
---
music?
---
No! It's all mine!
---
Also, NS bots you could tell apart from real people if you really tried. You can’t really tell the difference between a bot orca and a player in hisec, no matter what you do.
---
This is the right answer
---
I want to say thanks for the most recent local change to nullsec. I did wormholes for the most part of my eve career and moved to null after hearing all the hot debate around it to see for myself. I'm really enjoying the quality and quantity of the fights I get &amp; the lack of intel really adds depth to the decision making people do. It feels like wspace and I'm playing a lot more than I thought I would which is bad now that classes are starting back up! Keep up the good work and thanks again for spicing things up!
---
No poors allowed, that's why.
---
&gt; Maybe you're right and just because I've been a developer for years I don't know what I'm talking about. 
---
Stephen King once said that writers are often the worst judges of what they have written. And unless you have developed something similar to Eve and since there is nothing similar to Eve then yes, you don't know what you are talking about. Blackout has had an effect on botting and even capsules on gates \[I endorse stargate destruction btw\] cannot stop wormholes and seeding a system/afk cloakers. I kind of suspect that people complaining about anti-botter initiatives are themselves botters or maybe supportive of them but since you cannot know for sure then listening to what they say is stupidity in itself.
---
Yea sorry you are right. I was just being dumb.
---
He needs to learn the hard way like the rest of us...
---
&gt;You cant deny that forcing people to set up these intricate systems is going to raise the barrier to entry by a ton.
---
The thing about the Internet is you only need one person to climb over that barrier.  Then he sells his bot software.  And changes like blackout mean botters have to buy again.  It's a nice windfall.
---
It's not like most botters were actually developing their own bots before this.
---
Why do you assume they were capable of it before? If faced with a massive reduction in income they may well decided to expand their operations to restore their income stream.
---
I keep getting the feeling people think botters are just running this shit on their spare laptops, and running as many bots as they can off that. That's not what's happening here. They are doing this for RL money, and would no doubt be willing to spend a bit of money to keep the income flowing.
---
Does earn you Reddit points and a recruitment story.
---
&gt;I don't shoot newbies, and I don't shoot indy stuff unless it's from an actual enemy. 
---
&gt;I just don't see it as honorable or at the very lest leet to pick on the lowest hanging fruit. 
---
You'll never be a 3l33t pVp player at that rate.
---
Don’t worry, them being destroyed was the nerf. I’m always happy when caps die.
---
Yea good point. It just takes one guy.
---
Lots of Isk and/or large balls. 
---
Also not every titan pilot wants to be in a large alliance. Large alliances are the ones with titan SRP.
---
Im a simple man.  I see triglavian ships I dock up.  They are far to fast, Far to strong and able to tank way to well.   
---
KEeping them balled up allows them to feed of each other and there ability to project reliable damage and track almost perfectly is absurd.   
---
ECM changes also mean  they fly with a Damps and they are untouchable because you cant break the chain.  
---
The triglavian weapons tracking, Damage and ability to project their damage makes me dock up.  Most t1 cruisers lose to a Kikimora.  A caracal can push it off but thats it, You cant catch it because anything that goes for tackle gets melted 40km out.   
---
Anything below a t1 cruiser gets wiped off the field bya  kikimora and anything attempting to get in close to hold it down is wiped out.  They have completely ruined PVP.   Triglavian ships in PVP result either you dont fight them or you just blob them... Thats not a good situation.
---
I can't go into the specifics of how we confirm the ownership in the tough cases. I am sure you understand why. 
---
Personal information, as well as card number would be irrelevant in this case, sadly. If a third party has access to player's personal email, then most likely none of the information is safe. 
---
Other means... all I can say is that it's not that easy as it might seem. Otherwise these cases would have been solved quicker.
---
If not already then it will in time (many things have already, DED loot and ore for instance). Always reserves to deal with. That is correct, prices will go because of the reasons you have presented. Which is exactly the point, purchasing power is connected to the entire basket and not just one item in it. 
---
But PLEX can be used as an indicator for inflation, if it falls we will have inflation as there is less PvE people (accounts) in the game and that will make prices go up. To use your example of excavs, less miners out in general which means lower PLEX demand but in turn the prices on everything t1 and t2 will go up, after depleting reserves. Lets say you pre-blackout needed to spend 4b montly, 2b for PLEX and 2b for ships/mods. If you spend 1,5b for PLEX today but have to pay 3b for ships/mods then your purchasing power is less, your isk value has in fact dropped and not gone up. 
---
Yes, and the effects blackout has on it. Botting shouldnt be a concern for us.
---
Thats true. But I doubt we are even close to that point, besides you dont place all your eggs in one basket. I doubt botters just bot Eve but do it in a variety of games at the same time already.
---
Never used a skill injector.
---
Completely disagree, even if you could focus fire and removing basically any downside they currently have, they're still a major dps cut from just using regular missiles. Any fleet using FOF missiles would just be better by using regular missiles. In fact, except some very niche uses (like doing C6 ratting with FOF Ravens), it's better to get regular missiles in all situations.

---
POS code in action ladies and gents ;D
---
&gt;Though I would say Jesus H Christ, what the hell get a job, if they are.
---
COL is low in places like Russia, and they have plenty of skilled programmers.  There's going to be an entrepreneur among them that sells their software to botters as their job.
---
Damn planck generators.
---
I could swear this worked a decade ago, sorry if it doesn't.
---
Wow TIL, thanks!
---
Loads of misconception.
---
Rorqs were bottled, but not as heavily, because of 2 reasons. First, Rorq and it's pilot are rather significant assets. Having them banned is bad for business. Second, bots cannot go on coms, cannot shout for help, and most importantly suck at detecting cyno inhib. Other than that, they are perfect material for botting programs.
---
Thing is much more tricky with botting supers. It's fit is usually tailored for the program botter is using, and what kind of scripts he's using. Supers with NSAs and with Sebos are used both by humans players and boters alike.
---
On the side note, making all PvE WoW-like Incursions is bad. Eve it's not WoW, nor should it aim to become more WoW like. Changing the whole game just because CCP cannot solve boting problem is stupid. If anything they should add some sort of captcha, but knowing about exploration bots, I heavily doubt they would be able to do something like this, without being straight up Google Captcha. Bots are simply getting better and better at it.
---
yes!!!!! Robotech FTW!
---
However, a myrmidon is worth what, 50 mil after insurance? Basically about an hour’s worth of ratting. They can lose quite a few of them and still be profitable, because of sacrificing one myrm to each t3c gang is what it takes to keep the rest safe, then they’ll do it. 
---
And with plex being cheaper, the botmadter can RMT his isk for more money, so a reduction in isk generated doesn’t necessarily mean a reduction in profit
---
Tf when killahbee shit talks on pandos stream for us fighting gotg whilst we are balls deep with faction titans and supers on grid.
---
super on super action with no tidi? the fuckin dream man. Good shit.
---
thank you very much
---
So no sealing for this can of worms?
---
:sadface:
---
Ah, I see, that makes sense. Thanks for the clarification. /wooshed myself.
---
That's happening today? Shoot, I am at work.
---
now this is a salty boi
---
wow awesomeness :) I hope the loot fairy was kind today :)
---
Logging off was an unreliable at best method. Especially if your computer (like mine) takes a while on black screen, by the time you've loaded in you have been in local for 10+ seconds and the ratters were already in warp to their structures.
---
rekt noob

Is citadel ratting c5/c6 drifter spawns a mechanic or an exploit? Currently you can spawn a drifter with subcap ships in high class wormhole systems and lure them to your citadel in the wormhole with ships that can hold it down in tether range. It seems pretty cheesy that the buffer from the citadel can tank atleast 5 drifters while dreadnoughts actually spend the time and risk in the site. This mechanic allows for whoever owns the citadel to spend little risk aside from running the combat site to start the drifter &amp; even in these cases these ships can micro jump drive cause the NPC's do not scram further guaranteeing their safety. I thought wormholes were suppose to be regarded as the most dangerous space however this mechanic proves the contrary.
---
so for the uninformed what just happened who are fighting and what over and why? I have been out of game for years so I am total in the dark when it comes to alliance/coalition level stuff.
---
I’ve gone for 3 years now and I’ve loved every bit of it. If you love vegas anyways, it’s almost a given. I know people who go to Vegas and do almost nothing with the event itself. Just show up at the flamingo and find the pack of nerds waving flags at some bar. “Hey what group are you guys with? What space are you in? What do you do?” All great conversation starters at a place like this.
---
I personally enjoy the presentations and such, but I think I’m one of the few. One benefit of that is you also get to talk with people in the show area CCP has for some merchandise, new games, raffles etc.
---
I also recommend the party. It’s just fun. 
---
Worst comes to worst, just see which groups show up on your killboard most often and go find them. I’ve talked with a surprising number of people who have only ever met me via gunfire.
---
Why you get this reaction it's honestly very simple because i don't believe a word you said, i'm thinking from the first comment you and everyone else that follows eve was aware about what 2 scenario's i was talking about how the players in question where and that multiple tickets where likely filed for both players. 
---
Now i feel i'm dealing with cynical deflection tactics rather then with somebody that cares about player interaction the community and all the standard PR responses don't really help that. 
---
There is also the rather ugly thing that to this very day this player represents the community and does service as a reminder, they majority of the eve player base doesn't mind homophobia and if anything feel represented by it.
---
Only panic when you see combats really. 
---
You can also escape most camps with Mwd - Cloak - change direction
---
I mean it was mostly sarcasm, but each to their own
---
Do you not get sarcasm or something
---
why are you talking about npc null you goddamn brainlet?
---
Is there a system in place for volunteers to help out with stuff like the Meet n Greet program or new player experience? I’ve never seen a link or ad about helping.
---
Never saw one, hope I will find this famous 1b proteus fit @20k EHP someday, look like a juicy prey
---
Thank you for all the work you do :)
---
Rgr, on another note, would you accept 50mil ISK for your GM chars frozen corpse? or 1,000,000 unites of quafe or 650,000 unites of quafe ultra? or 400 non-GM frozen corpses? (very few repeat corpses)
---
Lemme know if you're interested :P
---
Fast kitey ships should instakill titans!  Covert cynos are completely fine htfu! Let’s all just kill pve ships and then cry on reddit when they use capitals! NERF CAPS REEEE MY KILLS DANGER

I thought people may find this game interesting.

Smarn is in snuff just trolling the thread.

Watched a bit too much Netflix?
---
yeah day tripping is the way to go with wh's. just think of them as the short cut through the woods, off the main roads where you might find something cool... or die
---
Did you use a Black Ops BS or Force Recon to light the Cyno?
---
Leavings is about what I'd call them. Equivalent to droppings.
---
ETECSa open  time ago some wifi spots in the public parks so people when log in you use to see them on the sidewalk of the street  doing IMO with family and friends  we use to came in group with chairs  cause the wifi acces point was on the corner of el tanque a site here in las tunas call  and stay at lay sharing our itnrnet  by conectify or another hotspot was super slow  but was the way to go
---
and every etecsa internet service have a cautive portal so you cannot go tru or have internet if you do not put  time to your account  could be 1 or 2 hours  3 a top  as normal cuban paycheck is just 15 dollars a month so yeah we have to find ways to share one internet acces to have more time even it is slower
---
Yeah.  Yesterday my static led me into a 20+ hole chain.  I have a perfect scanner alt with Virtues so I'm able to scan quickly.  I'm definitely seeing a large increase in the amount of wormholes.
---
Ah, maybe that's why I don't get it? hah
---
To answer your tldr, resource scarcity is coming and other Pve rebalancing, the hunter vs prey and risk vs reward dynamics will even out. 
---
Reading through this thread I don’t think there’s much point posting this but I will. I regularly roam with 2-5 guys in “nano cancer” and will tackle anything we can can get our hands on. If it’s a pve vessel we will hold it for ages basically screaming “here we are, come and fight us”, the usual response is a cyno on the pve ship or a ram+scram cyno. That’s just instant death hence “nano cancer”. There are rare exceptions and we do fight outnumbered and outshipped but it’s rare that they even bother bringing subs. Also rorqs can just fuck right off, yet they’re all you see in most regions. 
---
The changes to cynos are so very welcome. No longer will it be “does he have a cyno? Do they?” Preventing any kind of brawling. Now there will at least be a warning of a recon before you get turbodunked by every spod rain capable of launching fighters. 
---
Adapt or die is harped by everyone benefitting from x change. I’ve adapted through cap aids and now you will have to adapt also, seems fair to me. Bring on chaos.
---
I will double that container
---
Reading this post and I feel satisfaction.
---
Well, updoot, not because I think your system is perfect but because it will get newbros thinking about _having_ a system and giving them something to start with.
---
I'm definitely seeing it.  A few days ago was the first time my c3 static just had its own kspace static and not 2-6 extra wormholes.
---
Check the purpose of this guide, it's not "how to avoid gate camps" or "how to engage a target", I cannot make a flowchart explaining how to react to everything and there is a large probability that the people aimed at this flowchart can't access cloak.
---
I am disgusted and outraged with myself. Thanks for checking.
---
Fly a nano ship solo. Ive flown them in small gangs but never solo. Probably never will. I usually fly blaster ENIs or AC tirple rep gnosis, brawling ships. Im not too sure why I have such an affinity to brawling fits. Perhaps its because Ive found nano ship infuriating to fight against in the past or maybe I enjoy the surprise an enemy ship has when you apply your face melting dps or rep their damage while latched onto them knowing that at least one of you are going to die. Ships are ammunition and easily replaced. I dont see the point of not going all in.
---
Up to a 33% reduction... that is pretty cool, my wallet is crying though at the thought of the cost.
---
Being able to change the exit day/time would make citadels way more fun. Do it like entosis or something rotates it an hour forward at a time.
---
It already happened before blackout. Gate pods aren't a new thing, you could see them in places with deadends frequently before.
---
Difference is now it's at a scale we didn't see prior. If people called you dumb for that one, fuck em'.
---
Of course. For good practice
---
Remove capital docking in npc stations then yes
---
Do you know any other GM out of work character? If you do, do they know you know? :) Maybe you fought along or versus each other?
---
Thanks for the tip! I tried but it seems no such event was recorded unfortunately. But thanks anyway!
---
We do it because we like the people we've been playing with for years. It's the same reason why people build and haul at cost or for no profit, because they enjoy the people they play with.
---
Ill write them a support ticket.
---
Hello :) I lost an active rep ship to sleepers. in a wormhole when my internet died. But my internet died in a L4 mission site once while engaged and it still warped off even with timer. But not in j space? :( .
---
True that, very old shit. I work as a recruiter, so my job is to make ads and stuff. So I guess eriting a support ticket could help.
---
What happen if the decision after Ship Finded is a No? It's a dead end. You can't go backwards.
---
Username does not check out
---
Please point me to a game with anticheat that doesn't have cheaters still.
---
Also why not remove dscan altogether while we are at it?
---
Oh that’s the next big nerf after the my, death to the proc it might make a few million isk can’t have that now
---
Upright panel of your screen &gt; board corvette

They will always find a way around. I'm a cyber security guy, it's not about stopping everyone it's about making it hard enough it's not worth trying. Some will always keep trying but most will give up
---
so uh theres a third option, im retarded
---
Never lived in a nullsec Bloc. I've done lowsec in larger groups and have done highsec in larger groups.
---
Keep returning to wormholes
---
What's in the offensive content? Is it a personal letter from CCP telling players to f-off??? Lol
---
&gt;*Remove asset safety to incentivize destruction 
---
No, those serve a good purpose of preveting returning players or people traveling/working aboard/on deployment for long times from ragequiting because they lost everything.
---
But make Assets Safety "activate" for each account after a certain time of not loggin in, let's say a month... fast enough to protect those people, not enough to help people that wants to avoid a fight without consequences.
---
&gt;*Citadels shouldn't be anchorable on gate grids
---
Why?
---
&gt;*No more tethering on low-power structures 
---
Yes
---
&gt;*Booshing off tether should be possible again 
---
Not really sure why this should be a thing, so "maybe".
---
&gt;*The damage cap should be increased 
---
Fine as it is.
---
&gt;*Smaller citadels should have one less timer
---
Yes, which ties directly to my previous and first answers.
---
&gt;*Buff structure defense capabilities. Make them more dangerous but less tanky. 
---
Seems fine at the moment, but I'm no expert on the matter, so "maybe"?
---
I would stick fraternity space in a velator and blow it up.
---
That face towards the end. :D
---
Do you agree that black out was a step that just so happened to make it harder for bots?
---
That recently* changed. It used to be automatic but now you have to hit that board my Corvette button.
---
*I don't know when they did this so it could have been like 2 years ago for all I know

It wasn't any computer, it was computers with vista installed on a drive that is not C.

How would you like to see it work?
---
did imgur link not populate properly?
---
Don’t bookmark scanned down wormholes from probe scanner window either. Only bookmark from overview when you are on grid. Otherwise you will warp to zero and find you are 15k from the hole with no outs as the Loki decloaks.
---
Killahbee is a coward tho
---
I don't think it did? I can only see the picture of everything you got? I wanted to see the description of the offensive content.

Depends on your personal level of conspiracy theory.
---
Either CCP's backed up due to the traditional August vacations, or CCP is desperately trying to figure out how to spin a MER that shows a massive reduction in players as a good thing.
---
 How many people have to unsub from the game to get local in 0.0 back?"
---
Remove citadels and pos' from wormholes.  
---
Remove 1 timer from all other citadels.  
---
24 hour 1st timer, 8 hour second timer.  
---
Reduce asset safety to 50 % and drop the rest as loot.  
---
 All fixed.

It was only to distract you from all the Lokis.

Why the fak you didnt bounce and scan plex before warping ?

Hello GM Team.
---
I am national athlete of Canada. You are the elephant. I respect the elephant.
---
Basically you fit every low slot on a myrmidon with shield recharger 2's. Then the midslots contain t2 extenders and a EM resistance amp. Rigs contain the shield recharge rigs, 2 t2 and 1 t1. Then the highs have three rails, a probe launcher and a drone extender. Spam drones while shooting, it can take on C3 magnetars if you are aligned, and can take on every c3 site fine in a normal hole.
---
I scouted like 160 systems yesterday late on and found nothing
---
Responded in another comment to that question. I'll post the actual fit once i can get it up again.
---
Looks like Reddit did t load that thread, your right, he did ask.
---
I would but I can’t see them anymore, it’s chaos blackout
---
Also the little fact that the br sugests 54 vs 18 may have been a tad outnumbered.
---
Got to admit, the op has a point re the deployment of their capitals. Of course had the OP's alliance been smarter, not waterboarding the caps might have ended in more and better kills?
---
Oh sorry, thought you meant I got flagged lol. hold on
---
I do but I think it really needed some extra backend work to go with it personally. Now I obviously don't know what extra they did, they're budget, project management style and project schedules, but the black out alone is kinda like closing Port 3389 sure it takes the easy way off the table but there's plenty of other slightly harder options to an attacker, it in this case botter
---
He is showing the size of shit CCP is taking on capital umbrellas
---
Don't scare them that much, every newbro that start taking the way of Bob can become a proud wormholer someday!
---
More ~~targets~~ comrades are needed for wormholes!
---
I'm going. Dont really know anyone but I'll be in Vegas for a few days before through the next Wednesday. Really just going to listen, maybe talk to some people. It looks fun so why not I get comp'd rooms from MGM hotels so I'm only paying for like 4 nights
---
Fuck now I'm concerned about training into.a rag. FFS.
---
If you happen to like getting scared to hell. Then a passive tanked myrmidon can take on 1000dps. the issue comes in with volleys, if three battleships do a full volley on your shields you will be down immediately, buuuut if one fires after another it can take it. Also dont forget resistances.
---
Considering there's whole alliances that play and live on SiSi, I'd say that's not a far fetch
---
It’s fairly recent, this year I think.
---
Sounds like we need to get together, I've been itching to pipe bomb someone ever since getting pipe bombed myself...

Harvard wants to know your location

I think that you did that to me. I was a newb teaching a newb and I accidentally used logi drones on a rat. I was very confused to why my drake got concorded. The smileys helped lessened the impact.

Good ol' escrow. Never scammed anyone with it but did earn a reasonable amount of ISK buying lots people accidentally put up for way too cheap etc.

I like to call it the "flattleship".

Thats why you run it on Foothold or Adjacent.

Perimeter its the only "safe"

the other 2 will get reinforcement from outside
---
Adding 2+ bots sitting on gates, spam checking d-scab won’t be the straw the broke the camels back. You’re seriously overestimating the operational costs for someone to have a couple of alphas sitting on gates. The only way to prevent effective bottling is to reduce the amount of info you can get from d and concurrently having dynamic enter and exit points into system, and both solutions are cancerous
---
Stop it! You're making the Spodbrain combust!
---
I do not see the word "all" in his statement.
---
Huh. Guess they must've changed that, since at least these days you can repair rats without any problems. Can't recall accidentally trying back in the old days. I can imagine that would be an odd situation to encounter though!
---
Do you still encounter support tickets with Dust 514? 
---
E.g. players requesting stats on dust characters, players delivered assets accidentally to dust players, wacky corporation roles, tickets to delete dust characters to free up their names?
---
Also has the dust item database been completely cleared? I recall a buddy of mine requested that his strongboxes be removed rather than open them with keys. He disliked the clutter. I am wondering if it's possible (to this day) to file a formal support ticket to have strongboxes removed on a character--just for peace of mind.
---
Again, you are making a lot of assumptions. You assume that RMTers have the cash on hand to upgrade hardware - and even if they do, isn't imposing that on them a worthwhile goal? If we increase the barrier to entry for botting/RMT, _isn't that a good thing that makes botting harder?_ I have a really hard time understanding how you can simultaneously believe that these changes have made botting more expensive and resource intensive and also not made it harder/less common/less desirable/hurt botters.
---
 I really don't get it. We seem to agree that botters have had to change their products (either those they use or those they develop). They're much more restricted in the ships they can use, namely using ships with much lower isk/hr. They (potentially) have to spend money to upgrade hardware in order to run enough accounts to support the intel bots + more ratting bots they need in order to make the same income as before. They are vulnerable in more ways that they cannot possible automatically prevent (i.e., hunters who don't jump a gate but log off and come back after the timeout/downtime), wormholes, and attacks between the time that an intel bot is destroyed and a new one is placed at the gate. Where we seem to disagree is that all of these effects will hurt botting. You cannot possibly simultaneously believe that all of these barriers were just erected and also botters will ignore them. It's not realistic.
---
why wasnt your titan there?
---
Maybe just get rid of a timer or combine the shield and armor timers plus get rid of low-power structure tethering. It doesn't need to be complicated. Asset safety is fine.
---
When is the exact date for the official Korean localization?
---
Or are you not allowed to tell us other than sometime this 4th quarter?

Lol, at least my posts are close to reality.

if I want to make P4 commodities with PI, how many planets will I need? If I have two characters with IV CCU is it better to simply make P2 on all 10 planets? Should I even bother with P4?

Would like to congratulate you for making it to the V0lta Salt-storage channel
---
Could I just bring a battleship into low sec using this method ? Or mdw/cloak trick only works with cruisers?
---
I only bring my cloaky Tengu in assuming it’s the only safe thing that can actually survive tougher anoms and ded sites, even then its HAM fit, so i often get swarmed and have to warp off to recover. 
---
Once you refit to combat mode in a vexor, what’s the strategy to not get ganked while running an anomaly? Sometime d scan doesn’t cut it (they could just decloak and snag you), in the tegu if someone is in local I’m pretty much constantly aligned while fighting, which sucks in a HAM Tengu with only 30km range.  With a VNI, if I warp to a safe spot bookmark uncloaked, can they scan me down ?  If not, I assume they can once I pull out the mobile depot to refit to cloak/MWD travel fit? 
---
Sorry about all the questions :)  is the VNI setup of choose just sentries ? 
---
I’m a little better skilled for shields, is there a good VNI alternative ?
---
Margin buying mechanics question:  If your total market escrow is enough to cover one of your margin buy orders, will the order succeed? Or does each order only have access to its respective escrow amount?

MY THERAPIST MADE A LOT OF MONEY FROM THAT DOCTRINE
---
STILL DOESNT BEAT BOTH TIMES WE TRIED TO STEAL ASHERS ISHTAR DOCTRINE
---
You would have a hard time convincing me anyone in this game truly wants a fair fight.
---
Asset safety is important for people that have extended illnesses, job loss, travel, and other life events. Eve should be difficult, not cruel.
---
Structure spam is a problem, but just make the damage cap scale logarithmically and remove one of the timers.
---
WORD
---
This is the current situation, carriers are pure garbage
---
just only allow cloaks on force recon and blops then they could only cloak on grid with those ships. That would fix everything.
---
Citadel defense capabilities are actually in a good spot problem is the timers.
---
I agree with medium citadels being two timers. 
---
I would go as far as low power structures lose their final timer window and it generates a random timer 24/72 hours after initial ref. 
---
Those two changes alone would probably quadruple the number of structures killed.
---
T1 cruisers should have enough CPU for an expanded probe launcher + rangefinding array. You may need to use a few co-processors / overclocking rigs to get there, but vs T1 frigs and destroyers, you should be still be viable. T1 cruisers are cheaper than T3.
---
Detection is a lot harder in this type of game, and in this game in particular. If you look at most MMOs, they've always had bots in some form or another. Almost all MMOs also allow some kind of UI customization which probably aids in scripting bots.
---
What makes it worse in this game is that everything is laid out in menus - no real need for visual identification when targets/locations are dumped into one specific window
---
So the most valuable loot are soe probes?
---
Honestly I'd love to go to these bot null systems, build fucking warp disruption structures on all their best routes, and wait in black ops battleships.
---
Just fuck them over with setting those up with covert ships, then trigger their "scout" to signal the retreat.
---
And watch them burn.
---
I just started school again and yeah I can agree with you. Can't wait until I can get an ethernet port in my room...
---
Actually, as far as "how to fix ____" threads go, those are pretty reasonable ideas imo.
---
Ah yes, just remove anyones ability to live in wormholes. Im sure that wont be a problem for anyones play style at all.
---
Nah mate the selected items were what he gave me
---
&gt; dual scram
---
cheap faction scram + long point instead?
---
&gt; out of scram (or disruptor) range
---
then they cant point you and you warp off.
---
&gt; Is it possible to make bombs go all blinky on the overview?
---
No, looks are based off status, not item type
---
And is that because it fits your narrow perspective of how Eve should be played?
---
Tbf i told yondu to not be dumb dumbs and feed pred caps to save them the hassle of having their shit killed etc. but they ignored be and welped 40bil, therefore making dhsj much more interested.
---
Dumb dumbs
---
For asset safety, may be able to get the best of both worlds by increasing the isk you have to pay to get the stuff back and giving that isk to the corporation/alliance that dealt the most damage to the structure as it died.
---
Incentive to his big stuff for dank payouts, keeping asset safety around for busy/returning people, and also adding just a little bit more isk risk for putting too much stuff in a citadel.
---
What's the biggest thing you have ever reimbursed and/or the craziest thing you have ever reimbursed.
---
ugh still waiting for the live action movie :(
---
could still be partial though, doesn't have to be 100%.
---
If you want to put ALL your stuff in a citidel, do so at your risk.
---
Because CCP are tards and roaming gangs of trigs can now enter. So when the minors say 1-3. It means 1-3 if you dont get a roaming gang landing on you. So its kinda garbage. Now if the reward and pilots scaled as you went into these sites in the systems with more scary roaming gangs I'd be cool with it...but they dont
---
Maybe you should buy a succubus :thinking:
---
Beyond the Corp logos there's a lot about Corp management that's simply outdated. I personally wouldn't want to changing any of the core concepts and mechanics behind it, but would be nice to see it get a big QOL/ui refacing pass to make the system a little easier to understand and use.
---
*"Remove citadels and pos' from wormholes."*

Stay tuned for more **shit stupid people say.....**

Burn in a different direction to avoid the bomb as soon as you see it, if you do this correctly you can avoid them, if you are too slow you'll go boom; bombs fly straight for 30k and explode, but the radious isn't that big to be unavoidable.
---
All this would do is get rid of the actual threat bots.
---
Seriously, this could be a good idea. A simple bot to trigger their bots into being useless. And if it stops working,
---
The bots are very much open to attack then, aren't they?
---
Post blackout, gate grid citadels serve as a risk free intel tool for botters. It’s currently possible to tether an alpha pod on a citadel near a gate that instructs your bot farm to dock up when someone enters the system. There’s a thread on reddit about this exact thing right now. Check it out.
---
Removing citadels from gate grids accomplishes a few things. Without a citadel to tether to, you’re going to need a cloaked scout that requires an omega subscription. Even if it seems marginal, botters will be forced to incur a cost to gather their intel. Since there’s no silver bullet to stopping bots, death by incrementalism is the best we can do. 
---
The only other option for botters is to use alpha pods on perches at gates, but with a little effort, these are killable, unlike ships tethered to citadels. Even if the botter is using a script to replace his lost pod each time, a simple bubble trap will fix the problem.
---
Either warp out, or take the hit. It won't be enough to kill you (I believe) but the sig bloom can hurt an active tank one pretty good. Same goes for torps, you'll be able to chase off/kill a bomber pretty quickly with drones. If it's one bomber you should have no issue replying between bombs if it's one guy. I'm not at my PC, so I'm not sure if you can tweak overviews to flash for bombs.
---
As with any Wingspan situation, they're more annoying that they are dangerous. Go to a wormhole without a kspace connection and you've effectively limited the chances a Wingspan pilot finds you by 90%
---
How can I set up chat channels the way they are in this video? So tabs are always visible but chat box only opens if you click on them?
---
You're more likely to be attacked if you're in someone's chain. Most C4 corps won't have a C1 static (because C1 sites are bad), and I guess the same is true of people living in C2s (even if they want HS logistics, the C3/HS is more likely). So you're probably marginally less likely to be attacked in a C1. But I doubt it makes a lot of difference.
---
Don't worry. It's not his play style so it doesn't matter. Infact, it might make his play style a lot safer.
---
this needs to become a pasta
---
I mean the main problem with what he's saying is that just like he said, things don't work everywhere just because they work somewhere. 
---
If only he realized that also applied to the fact that the dudes here are all good pilots and know what they like, and they do it. Nothing he says has any relevance to that xD
---
♥ These guys though, good video and good fight. Can never be too many videos like this ^_^
---
No. Did it work?
---
Looks like an awesome fight - and a great video to go with it.  Keep it up my dood.
---
Most bc's can run c3 sites baring the assault ones like Naga/Oracle.
---
The only ones that prove an issue are data/relic and there's one two of the four that are actually a threat.
---
Most Drake's and myrms can deal with c3 rats. They aren't that hard.
---
Like a bubble, that doesn't just prevent warping off but also makes MWDs useless?
---
C3 (and C1) are bad as homes because they have no J space static, so you have nothing to farm. Nobody beyond a solo or 3 man corp can live off the sites in one hole, so if you don't have a static, most of the time you don't have any sites to run or chain to explore.
---
C3s are pretty nice as a static though so I wouldn't say C3 is 'dead'.
---
Armor timer ?
---
Are you making them from scratch or importing bought goods to  factory planet?
---
of course I am or you wouldn't be doing it
---
this was a final timer, but the the Fort reinforced during the fight.
---
Your wormhole was about to die, so by the time you left and came back, it had despawned. May Bob have mercy. 🙏
---
For my next daring suggestion, I say we remove industry from the game-NPC stations will sell all goods at fixed prices in random quantities. This will greatly benefit me, and therefor this is a good change.
---
insta undock obviously.
---
You have to bookmark bothaides. Also it may have closed on you, as wormholes tend to do.
---
Nah C4 sites are still bad, spawning 100km off and not even in the same direction. Because of that, C3s are better ISK/hr, even if you can run the C4s.
---
That's an unusual situation. As a bomber pilot (nearly 2,000 kills between Hound and Purifier) you don't often get a solo pvp scenario where you can one shot someone with a bomb like that. Your opponent was smart, got set up at the right range, and baited you into doing what he wanted you to do (burn into the bomb kill zone with your MWD signature bloom).
---
In the future you should keep range control in mind. If you get within 20km and get point/scram on the bomber it's going to die. You have much better tank and will apply better DPS in most (but not all) situations, except for gimmick fit bombers. But if it can keep you 20-45km away you're in deep trouble -- unless you warp out, which you can probably do thanks to limited point range.
---
Also, afterburners don't have the same signature bloom, fyi.
---
You can bring your battleship into low sec using this method.  EvE uni has a [article](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Cloak_trick) on using the mwd cloak trick.
---
What I do to not get ganked is use dscan a lot and move off from the warp in spot so that I am out of point range if someone cames into the initial site or into one of the next rooms.
---
If you are uncloaked they can scan you down, not while you are in warp to your safe spot. What I will do sometimes is if i find a site and there are a lot in local I check zkill and go afk for a few minutes while cloaked. See if it thins out. 
---
I usually have sentries and some light drones to kill frigs and destroyers. I will also have a remote armor repper to rep my sentries if the rats go for them. I just orbit my sentries as they kill targets, with my ab on. 
---
I have never run a shield VNI before to run ded sites. I dont think it has the capacitor for it. I have run ded sites in a shield ishtar though. Good thing about using an armor VNI to run them is they are pretty cheap so if you do lose one it wont be as big as a dent in your wallet. 
---
[Here](https://i.imgur.com/H02iHlk.png) is a armor vni that i came up with real quick. Should work for serpentis and guristas. Be careful with guristas 5/10 (i think) and also the 6/10. The final room can be tough. If I do it I usually just kill the overseer and bookmark his wreck, wait for the site to despawn then warp back to get the loot. There are a lot of youtube videos on the sites so you can see which ones are tough. One of the sites has like 4 webbing towers so when you first warp in there is a lot of incoming dps that is applied very well to your ship.
---
I've been on either side of the barrel often enough tyvm
---
MWD blooms your sig radius. Since you remained on grid he probably locked and target painted you as well, further blooming your sig radius. Astero should kill a bomber with drones if the bomber doesn’t get the jump on the Astero like that. A non bombing bomber should die pretty quick to an Astero. 
---
And yes, please drop your guard when you are down the wh chain. Pleeeese.
---
I usually overheat and burn right at them. Normally able to pass the bomb in flight and sometimes get lucky and decloak the bomber if they are slow.
---
are you implying there is any script involved, I am thrilled to see Chori banned for that in 2018.. oh, wait, 2018 is over and he is still not banned for using a lootscript according to mr. shithead? Imagine my shock.
---
Will Hilmar be replaced as CEO once the Pearl Abyss acquisition closes in October?
---
The cheapest faction scram is more than the hull. Once I'm more comfortable with PVP that's an option but for now I'll try to keep it cheap.
---
What if I had my iRobot AI sit at my computer and manipulate the mouse etc, not a script or a cheat... just had him farm all day while I was work...doooes that count?  Asking for a friend
---
Sorry, fuck bots, but making significant changes based solely on how bots operate is a sure way to fuck things up. 
---
People put citadels on gate grids for several other good reasons other than botting, legit intel gathering is clearly one. And you pointed how that change wouldn't change shit, since an empty pod floating on a perch would be the same, when it gets blown up it will just undock and go there again, achieving absolutely nothing.
---
Sorry, but you buried your already bad argument for that change yourself.
---
and MJDs yes
---
MJDs too.
---
Well yeah. Small gangs need a 100% certainty of killing krabs right. Chaos Era bebe!
---
fastest alt-tabber in new eden
---
That´s what heroes do
---
I am pretty sure there was reddit post with a EVE alliance flag raised at the Antarctic base (I think it was TEST)
---
Did they ever fix the ~~bug~~ feature where CONCORD faction police in the Sanctum constellation gave criminal timer if you took aggro passing through?
---
semi often
---
I didn’t say that it wouldn’t change anything. I said that a pod on a gate is killable whilst a tethered ship is not. One can be countered with a bubble trap, the other has no counter. 
---
Reading is fundamental.
---
No disrespect, but I think citadel mechanics in wormholes are fine. They don’t have asset safety as it is, and since you cannot claim sov, citadels are your only real option for a comfortable permanent home. To be honest, it seems like citadels were made for stuff like wormholes :P
---
&gt; then they cant point you and you warp off. 
---
Yeah, that seems to have been the best option, even though I wanted that fight. Up to the bomb.
---
And caps shouldnt be able to tether on citadels smaller then those they can dock at
---
So you would have to mess with POS code. Because everything being on fire is the next logical step after that :)
---
More like a group of related players that wanna play on same realm
---
It can work, but if the bomb is shot at lets say 35k from where you are, if you burn past the bomb theres a big change you'll get caught anyway. 
---
It's a matter of risking it to get the kill or play safe and gtfo, since the time to take the decision is too short to make those calculations (for me at least), so a fast reaction will change everything. But yeah, yours is a totally viable aproach.
---
Asset safety is an important mechanic to making the game not mega aids and too conflicting with IRL. The way it should work is that killing the structure reaps a bounty to the victor as a % of the total value of the assets inside (this is olmeca gold's idea), while randomly sending a portion of the assets home to another system. The portion that gets sent home should be high.
---
&gt; Cost.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; They need more hardware to run 40 than to run 10.
---
But if the cost was less than the profit before, then why not run 40 before? And if it wasn't, it will be even less the case after the profit is reduced with blackout.
---
This argument doesn't make sense, you would run the maximum number of profitable bots you could manage (to maximise your income) already.
---
It already is partial because you pay a retrieval fee
---
Yeah that, sorry I suck at spelling
---
Remove industry from 0,0 and high sec. Maybe move all industry to wh space :D
---
Honestly ghost training was probably the most overt, widespread and sickening exploit of them all. Probably one of the main factors for me in deciding to quit the game, as it totally exemplified how disconnected and incompetent the people working on  game  development are
---
How can you tell if people are docked in a citadel? I’ve never heard of this.
---
Doesn't mean he doesn't use an auto loot script. Just means he hasn't been caught yet but he will be so enough. Even your keyboard macro script from your g15 is bannable.
---
Also give every citadel a free cyno that can be remotely activated kthxbye
---
yes man thanks a lot.
---
&gt; And yes, please drop your guard when you are down the wh chain. Pleeeese. 
---
Oh, I was spamming dscan and saw him coming. It's just that the bait backfired  ¯\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Reading is fundamental indeed. I was the one that said that it wouldn't change anything, only pointed that you even mentioned a reason why.
---
Besides, by killing the pod you are also giving them intel genious.
---
There are currently 2 sotiyos in the south buddy but okay, also been 2 stain sotiyos in the past 4 weeks.
---
So what do they do about sigs?
---
Would be a crying shame if a bomber fleet strolled through a wormhole and stumbled apon their ships.
---
cosmos sites have constant rats.
---
Time to remove gates next?
---
Everything will be made from scratch, no importing.
---
So, a few years ago i started up my first reaction set of towers, and the next morning one of the towers had moved itself(and left the online+ running mods behind) some 150 odd kilometers away. Filed a ticket, it got lost in the shuffle and I fixed it manually, but when the GM got back to me, he made it sound like towers moving themselves was not a super uncommon thing. 
---
How often did this kind of bizzarre behavior come up with POS towers?
---
Which doesn't go to the person that killed it.
---
That's the issue with asset safety.
---
Camal concepts are horrible generally, and this is great example.  
---
This halfway approach actually incentivizes people to not return unless they're 100% sure they want to come back max effort.   
---
Not that creating a loot pinata out of citadels does anything other than accelerate us towards the one true blob but the halfway approach takes all the down side and creates a little more. Like why do we want to encourage people away from citadels? What is the benefit to forcing them into NPC structures and making more logistical effort for everyone just to have the tools to actually have a complex fight?
---
That would also be an acceptable middle ground, but to be honest I would rather things not protected by the timed-AS to be tied to the whims of the Loot Fairy as everything else.
---
There's a bracketed number next to the name of the citadel in space. It tells you the number of people docked.
---
I guess the difference between us is that I just really don't care what's happening behind the scenes with the botters. All that matters to me is that regardless of this change, we'll still have a fuckton of botters crawling all over the game.  - Is it harder for them? Probably. But it's still profitable so they'll still do it. The fact they have to spend more or earn less really makes no difference on my end of this equation.
---
The goal is to stop them doing it, and we aren't going to achieve that by fucking with game mechanics. They will always find ways to adjust to that, and it'll usually end up hurting legit players a lot more than the bots. - What CCP needs is more (any?) ways to detect and remove bots from the game. That's the kind of change I wish they'd focus more effort (money) on.

---
See you there!
---
I have never been an omega xd
---
You get the citadel modules + a metric fuckton of salvage tho
---
With an overheated MWD I'd clear the 15km blast zone in about 5s, which leaves 7s to see the Hound and react. Tight but possible I think.
---
it is partial 15% i think
---
No. To both title and content, first because I don't feel like it and second because it would be too OP.
---
On the same grid with the citadel, just select it and you will see a number in perentheses at the end of the line giving you how many people logged and docked in the station.

I dont see the issue. If 2 sabres can being ina. Fleet of 100 caps before people can alpha them off then why cant it be done with recons who can cloak?
---
You have to double click on the space right next to the cannel names
---
For the pictures I've seen it isn't located at CCP's HQ.
---
Is it only for GTX 20xx series?
---
&gt;No more tethering on low-power structures
---
yeah so strange that it finds power to power a massive Tractor Beam in low-power 
---
atlest make tethering use fuelblocks, even a low amount will add up for the big alliance that have 500 citadels
---
Oh nice thanks!
---
Ah that’ll be useful in the future for sure, thanks!
---
Yes, you will be able to see the monument at the local parking lot/car park
---
Nah, that sounds OP, and it would be really difficult to see at a glance what would scram and what would just point you.
---
If you want something that can bubble and scram then bring a HIC.
---
Don't activate your MWD? This is pretty clear and honestly bombs are in flight plenty of time to react. Astero's warp out in less than 5 seconds, avoiding bombs should be easy.
---
It isn't clear which card(s) it applies too
---
You speak of the Dick Virus proteus I see.
---
By that logic nobody would ever play this game since there are tons of other games that are easier. Or nobody in this game would leave HS. WHs are a nice playstyle and it simply doesnt suit everyone.
---
Pretty much this^ From experience years ago in C3, my corp at the time outgrew it really quick. For what the OP was asking it's my belief that C3 would be best for what he/she wants to achieve daytripping.
---
I agree with the Citadel changes mentioned above.
---
Imagine someone reaching out in a language he doesnt master, and the first person he encounters is you.
---
What a sad representation for the rest for humankind that is...
---
Sounds easy but the devil's in the details. Does each character with assets in the citadel get dinged for a fraction of them? What happens if a character has only 1 ship in the structure? Do they get 9/10 of a ship somehow, with the other 1/10 as bounty for the attackers?
---
Shake things up. Just like black out and cyno changes bro. No one's play style is safe.
---
I made the regrettable decision this morning of taking my little brother to learn golf....
---
Missed all of the good bits :(
---
Thanks for taking a crack at fixing Cap Proliferation. Personally I feel like this is a step in the right direction. But now I’m a little concerned that WH space is going to be more appealing to live in than NULL for the smaller alliances that cannot provide the logistical support for an umbrella. Is there plans to rebalance risk/rewards for NULL as it got a whole lot harder for the small industrialist?
---
Fountain blue status doesnt come cheap
---
Not guilty until found guilty. Don't open the box of me accusing you of something just because it hasn't been proven that you didn't do anything like that. 
---
What you have any proof of anything go ahead. I am a good looter myself and its usually not that hard when you are prepared. These constant accusations without any proof and even with an easy way to track impossible speed while looting (and I am sure he has been reported for that) and CCP has checked that.. and come up with nothing. 
---
Now tell me they won't bann someone without 100% proof and I will point you to a CSM member that have been banned just recently without good enough proof.
---
As I said, all those guys are full of shit and come up with empty hands for years now, how can that be that chori still is not banned if they are not wrong?
---
Its the typical story of a nullbloc incapable of stopping a single guy and making up stories how obvious he is cheating in their little echo chamber bespite the fact that that guy never gets banned, often even publicly shows how he does what he does. 
---
If you guys would invest that engergy into acutally undocking and playing the game this game would be so much better.
---
Damn son. Those are some God dang spaceships going to shoot some other spaceships. Cool.
---
God this is so true. I swear some groups have rollers on 24/7 standbye.
---
It go with others to "Potential threat here"... But maybe "potential" is a bit of a understatement if you meet people on grid in a wormhole.
---
&gt;Just because they aren't on Zkill doesn't mean there are none there.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I've killed 29 sotiyos and they've been somewhat evenly spread across the map.
---
please do upload them to zkill if they arent there already and show some evidence then. without evidence your claim is worthless
---
Maybe your own version of realty...
---
More than have been coming back and enjoying themselves. Your botting/afk ratting/rorqual/near2 alts don't count. They won't be missed.
---
Is it that long since XIX's evac fleet?
---
Exactly. You actually have to shoot them and watch reactions, see if they warp back in a pod or whatever to see fishy behaviour. You need to "break" them in order to see if theyre bots or not. But whos gonna do that kind of work in HS? Outside of a few select individuals nobody is gonna care about them which means they will go unreported and unkilled forever.
---
"Scared of dhsj" 
---
Lmfao, nobody js afraid of dhsj or pred.
---
So honest question: why are you against these changes? What are the downsides for you personally? You provide yes/no answers without any justification for most of the points I mentioned. 
---
Please explain why my logic rustles you so.
---
so why target the tankier dreads before the non tanky ones.  Or did it even matter    Saw a few phoenix get show before nags just wondering.
---
Seems to me like CCP had suspicions considering he couldn't even get on the CSM ballot. I've got enough proof and evidence for myself to conclude he is in fact using a loot script.
---
Try asking in r/evejobs
---
Not sure what are you reading mate, but I agreed to most of the changes, explained why assets safety should be toned down but not removed and asked "why?" to two of them.
---
You answered to only one and are "rustled" by my answer: no because it removes a valid strategic choice while achieving nothing but a small script change against bots.
---
The other "no" was damage caps, and because I simply thing those are in a reasonable place.
---
i assume the logs show nothing?
---
Well in that case then ye. But I mean you always had like 10-15 sec to catch them before. It was always hit and miss but ye ofc its easier now.
---
How nice for you to seek it out but then again shit does stick.
---
Same, and then found out that they only were in space from 1700-1900, which is while I was at work
---
Nah, bank fodder
---
Nothing drops from the contents of peoples' hangars.
---
That means its 100% asset safety.
---
To be fair, Machs has been top tier for basicially this whole scale.
---
we arent back to square one, bots now have an even more massive advantage over humans.
---
You ever put beer in a soda stream?
---
You should definitely attend! I’m super shy but always have fun talking to everyone and meeting new people. 
---
Do you fly with an alliance? Lots of alliances do their own events during the week as well.
---
Don't activate your mwd, take the hit because it still be manageable with an active rep. 
---
Keep hacking. 
---
Make them understand this won't kill you, so they'll have to try something else, perhaps forcing them to come closer
---
Cynos on capitals only allow for a very narrow perspective on how EVE is played. So yes, these changes are good.
---
GLOBAL TELL ALL YOUR FACTION TITANS TO DEAGGRESS OR WHATEVER I DONT WANT THEM GETTING AN EASY WIN ON THE BATTLE REPORT BECAUSE OF FUCKING FACTION TITANS
---
Not a GM obviously but I've been told its something the devs knew was possible before they released citadels but just had to much else going on to address it so they just let it happen. its not an exploit. This is something a lot of whs corps have been asking to get changed and with what ccp is doing these days I'd expect it sooner rather than later tbh.
---
Started playing in 2005. Have never left the starter system.
---
I hear its scary out there.
---
When every man and his dog owns a cap these days its not very narrow.
---
And im not sure what people dont get, the main issue with this change isnt that a ratter in a hel wont be able to get help easily, thats a good part of the change.
---
Its that large capital fights just wont happen, If CCP keeps making them more difficult to happen, they just wont happen.
---
Oof, I like this proposal!
---
Roughly from what I can see seems about 2 weeks if extra SP
---
If another Amarr alliance was to accidentally kill a few things, would that count?   
---
asking for a friend btw
---
I was pretty happy about the comet.
---
During the 2v1, I noticed the TD and I noticed I wasn't hitting. I didn't actually connect the two ideas until after the fight "oh that's why I was missing"
---
**CHAOS!**
---
&gt;. I've got enough proof and evidence 
---
You don't have shit lmao
---
While this solve the problem of Rorquals and Supers lighting cynos to get saved, it does not problems like capitals, titans and supers bouncing like crazy when jumping in for those massive and "needing" extra cynos to live.
---
This might be a stupid idea, but here goes...
---
What if pirates applied bounties to ratters that diminished over time according to how much and how recently they were ratting? This could affect players by further encouraging hunting in general, but could make hunting bots more fun because you can expect big payouts from them. If players don't rat for a while, their bounties go down. Bots will hardly ever stop ratting -- they'll always be maximally profitable targets. If you could make hunting them even more enticing than hunting "regular" rats you could at least put a damper on their effectiveness. As soon as they start doing enough to be a problem, they're become a predictable and high-value target for players.
---
It's not a "fix" to turn them into gameplay, but man that could actually make engaging those things a worthwhile activity.
---
You got the spodbrains, thats all you have. 
---
CCP gave a reason not to put him on the ballot which is completly disconnected from that. 
---
I got enough proof for myself and for everyone else to tell you are full of shit because you just repeating your lie and you are empty handed just like everyone else.
---
Do any of you guys know when the new implants are gonna be on Sisi for public testing?
---
Cant even be mad.
---
Yeah pretty much. Which reduced training time on something is always welcome.
---
You mean virtual machines on the same PC they were already using anyway? And use the same wattage you were going to use anyway. Only now you need to swap to a new botting script and invest a half hour whipping up some alpha accounts for you gate scouts? Seems like the same resource usage and pretty low effort.
---
So keep a system that sucks because its useful for extreme circumstances/maybe 5% of the people...
---
Thanks for the clearly explained pointers.
---
Number six seems paramount. Trying to start using hotkeys a lot more but it's a real change to my style of play.
---
As opposed to that sick graphic and detailed explanation of the "more than 3 botting regions died after Blackout"?
---
I've got more than enough confirmation for myself. Seeing shit with my own eyes enough times where shit disappears from the wreck before it appears on the 10 already decloaked peoples overview or even in space. Believe me I know better than anyone else how stealing works. As for the RMT side of things I've had 3 separate people who've left your illustrious organization say the same things in regards to Chori's illicit ISK trading.
---
Initposters are like goonposters, but slightly more clever and therefore more dangerous.
---
You don't need much dps to shoot drones or tackle ships. FoF missiles need a niche and that could be it. Plus the fact that you don't need to Target and lock is a big trade off for the lower damage. Put 5-10 Auto Jackdaws in your fleet and they'd cut through all the enemy drones. 
---
Again, they would need the be re-worked, but at least they'd be used and have a role.
---
Am gonna bitch about your intro.
---
20 seconds is way too long lol
---
instantly exploitable, if you put your shit in a citadel you're putting it at risk.
---
If you don't want to put your shit at risk there are options.
---
So your solution is to straight up remove the ability to live in them? Shaking things up would be changing wormhole spawns, or anomaly types, or the way sleepers work (roaming sleepers might be kind of interesting actually). Deleting structures is just plain stupid.
---
The implication you're trying to make here is that removing some people's entire playstyle is equivalent to inconveniencing entitled pricks who *already* turtle up into the biggest, safest group they can and then pretend the achievements of their blob are their own.
---
Hopefully it won't work, because *jesus* you're a disingenuous piece of shit.
---
Oh.. like straight up removing local from all of null? Funny that, era of chaos and all.
---
Tis a silly game
---
test put a piece of paper with their logo on the sign and took a pic then took a pic of them holding up a test flag.....
---
[Pandemic Legion fucking planted their flag](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BeZVBnoCYAAZYo_.jpg)
---
Not you, because you died to triglav recons.
---
Asset Safety should stay, its a good mechanic.
---
Incorrect. You are just chucking out shit and going right to insults. I was just saying that those would be some good chaotic changes. Your reaction tells me they would indeed would add chaos.
---
Definitely more than 5%.  The system also doesnt suck the system is good.
---
More like you're suggesting we throw away a system that works most of the time for a couple edge cases that can be solved with focused fixes.
---
I really like that idea actually, we should do this!
---
Except that you can still do what you did in null before blackout-we’ve been doing it in w-space for years. Its making something more risky, not removing the ability to use it entirely.
---
fucking cheaterhackers
---
I'd argue 0% loot fairy but i get your point, tbh upping asset safety by 5-10% and having the extra drop as tags would go a long way
---
Nah, lets get rid of cynos first.
---
All I'm doing here is answering your question, and trying to help.  
---
All you're doing is throwing around accusations from a standpoint where you just don't know all the context.
---
So, let's try this again. While you may think that the two cases are identical, they were most likely not the same. **Context and history matters.** It's my job to help, and that's exactly what I'm trying to do here. If you want to have this actually looked at, give me some ticket IDs (or those screenshots). As per usual, we cannot go into too much detail, unless it's specifically your account we're talking about. As both myself and LGM Lelouch mentioned in the ama today, our system for punishments is escalating - first there are warnings, then temporary suspensions, then bans. If two players breach the same rule but receive different punishments, the most likely reason is that one of them had a long(er) history of past warnings or bans. Or one of them also did something else at the same time, that you don't know about...
---
I don’t like asset safety, but it has a role for players who cannot play all the time, get sick, get hurt, get deployed, etc. 
---
The 15% retrieval cost needs to be adjusted. It’s too low and it doesn’t benefit the attacker. The cost should be raised to a 30% cost to recover your assets. I’d suggest 10% of that cost should go into an ISK sink. The other 20% should be paid out to the players who killed the structure, based upon percentage of damage inflicted. Obviously, if the owner never recovers assets from safety, then the attacker doesn’t get paid, but it’s potentially a way to recover some ISK value from the defender.
---
I can imagin the panic the front line GM had when this guy suddenly started demanding a manager.
---
"I...I thought we were cool?! What did i do?! the issue is resolved! I dont understand!"
---
Where are killmarks on a leshak? On the website there is not a picture for a leshak (https://mossworks.xyz/killmarks/) and i cant find it in google images or on my shak
---
Eve is not America. You agreed to the Terms of Service and the End Users License Agreement which basically states CCP can terminate your access to the account for any reason CCP chooses. CCP also owns the information, and you, th end user, do not own any information on their servers. Since your characters and everything else are their property they dont have to let you play the game. 
---
Also it's pretty typical for someone to be defending the guy when it's pretty clear he used a loot script when I was there for the last kill. Sorry I didnt record it for you. When someone else complains he didnt even see the loot by the time he had it in his bay and the loot is gone, maybe just for a second it's not a fairy tale. 
---
One way to prove him innocent or guilty would be for CCP to release their logs from the server actions, but I wouldn't fret too much about this action, as we all know CCP doesnt have the brains or the heart to have this discussion settled.
---
Um. Some c3s have like 1.2k dps per wave.... This fit only tanks like 400 max
---
Who brings the best lunches to the office. Also how hard would it be to get to the HQ fridge and procure said lunch. Asking for a friend.
---
Replied on another comment. But 5his 1k ehp BC seems magical. I'm only hitting 400 ehp/s with a passively fit myrmidon. Are u sure these stats are possible...?
---
Ah, right, makes sense. Yea a covops changes things up bigtime.
---
Got another one last night
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/78531487/
---
I was standard fit, scram/web/ab. His fit looks standard blaster? Again, just used heated ab to keep range as best I could. Stupid video capture didn't work tho
---
But some have up to 1k dps. And a BC can only tank like 400 or so, I couldnt even do a c2 site with a myri cause I couldn't tank the last 600 dps wave...
---
&gt; Eve should be difficult, not cruel.
---
I believe Hilmar’s exact words were “Eve should be cruel, but fair.”
---
So run away if not in a capital
---
And people wonder why capitals are being spammed for pve...
---
Tethered booshing...yes please
---
And its also the number one reason why eve has such a small playerbase and absolutely trash tier retention. The game is fiercely harsh, yes. As it should be, and should remain. But that doesnt mean the players have to be gigantic fuckholes to each other.
---
Within the game. There's a difference between that and driving people away from eve because of rl situations.
---
I've never done one of those nullsec static unique pve things.  Most people don't even know they exist, yet somehow someone who logs in before me always keeps them on early morning farm and I never get a shot at the key.
---
Photos of a computer screen are real nightmare fuel
---
Yup I've been using Red Frog. Nice and cheap, even if it takes a few days.
---
Jeezus, that might make me come back. I literally quit because of the cyno changes and how hard it  is going to be to move ships. Doesn't change moving thru low sec on npc stations though. Like, i threatened to quit a lot and trimmed down subs, but the killing cyno change made me finally walk away from eve completely. It is kind of stupid and a silly reason to finally leave, but it was the lead brick on the straw pile of shit and ill placed changes that broke this camel's back. Making logistics harder (i move lots of caps in non-combat, as well as jfs) just turned eve into more work than it should be for a video game. I played eve because i enjoyed pvp as well as the empire building and mining and ratting and bringing new players to nul sec. Now its some pvp with a lot of what feels like work I played eve to escape from. Can't bring new bros out to nul to make isk anymore since drifters and now blackout.
---
multiboxing 3 accounts which used to be totally fine is now baking my pc with cpu and gpu tempteratures 20° higher than they used to be
---
Every now and then we do get some, and I usually handle them personally due to my background in DUST 514. It's pretty much what you listed - stats, Corp issues, character-names. I haven't seen incorrectly delivered item related tickets - not even sure this could be a thing, but I'll test it, I'm curious :)
---
Items are mostly gone as far as I know, so no need to request strongbox clearance :P
---
I drafted a basic anticheat ruleset for them ages ago
---
Best GM reply I've ever seen is this  
---
" **GM Guard** \&gt; I must ask you not to use the petition option like this again but i personally would finish the chicken sandwich first so it won´t go to waste. The spaghetti will keep and you can use it the next time you get hungry. Best regards. "
---
reddit is full of bullshit, I am no different, did you really get triggered enough to look at my past posts like a try hard? Lul
---
If ccp changed how we control drones to make how we control fighters then I would agree with you on the fun part.
---
I dont know what it is, but I just love controlling fighters, I get that Homeworld I &amp; II feel from the game.
---
 **GM Guard** \&gt; I must ask you not to use the petition option like this again but i personally would finish the chicken sandwich first so it won´t go to waste. The spaghetti will keep and you can use it the next time you get hungry. Best regards.
---
For an actual lore answer, Trigs have been targeting CONCORD for intelligence and information. It was part of the lore explanation for the sales tax rise.
---
Not a fan of the battle royale genre in general, but I would probably play the fuck out of this in eve.
---
Yea  i know  but im that dude without any skill of doing the screen cutting and i always use reddit on my phone
---
You can still do all of the things you want to do in a wormhole as well, just have to travel to them. A very minor change, besides null has no local now.. so it will feel just like wormhole space to you. As you say, blackout won't prevent you from doing anything you do now.
---
You need to fly nano/mjd fits so you can pull range and pick off groups piecemeal.  If you want to brawl, look at a Hyperion - it should be able to kill anything close enough to scram and MJD away, but the reality is if you go into a fight at zero against a group you'll probably die.  You need to split them.  
---
Target priority though:
---
Sabres/tackle
---
Anything that is a hard counter (Ashimmu/Curse if you're active fit)
---
"Squishy" DPS (think T1 cruisers, Pirate cruisers, etc)
---
Anything shiny you know you can melt 
---
And when you know you're not getting out, pick at least one ship you can kill before you go down - even if it's just a T1 Thrasher or something.  Take one more with you!
---
Yeah drone control is boring AF, understandable why it’s the preferred AFK form of ratting.
---
You say that until you get a capital ship of your own 👌
---
We all do, buddy.
---
Undock and deepsafe log
---
You say it, its not America. CCP could ban him with less reason and they don't.
---
"One way to prove him innocent or guilty would be for CCP to release their logs from the server actions, [..]"
---
You say it, they have the logs and don't do anything about it... how hard of mental gymnastics is it for you to consider that the logs proof you wrong and CCP just doesn't not ban a player despite they know he is cheating and they have the logs?
---
"Also it's pretty typical for someone to be defending the guy when it's pretty clear he used a loot script when I was there for the last kill."
---
It pretty typical for someone who is wrong to talk about how someone is cheating without any evidence, then tell he knows without any evidence then telling he has enough proof without bringing any evidence (not even talking about having or bringing any proof) and the only proof he has is telling that he was there.. which just leaves the option open that you don't understand what is going on. 
---
I was there too and you are just bad and have nothing in your hands but trying to defend yourself for beeing bad with accusations. 
---
"Sorry I didnt record it for you."
---
You are 100% convinced he is cheating.. yet you didn't record anything at any point? Tell me more of how much you are lying.
---
"[..] maybe just for a second it's not a fairy tale."
---
It is a fairy tale. Are you are the fairy working on your magic to fabricate a story.
---
I see, so for lowsec where I normally operate, would the best way to engage be sitting in a large plex and moving very far away from the beacon to keep the people warping in split up? 
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Okay.... I tested it on singularity. I just swaped the Field Extender for a second Anti EM Rig an tested Tier4 Electrical Sites. Finished the sites in under 15 minutes. This fitting works like crazy. Thanks man! :-)
---
By that logic you should also get reimbursed for ship losses incurred because you had to afk for a rl emergency.
---
I’m not necessarily saying HTFU and propose to outright remove asset safety, but I don’t think it’s reasonable to expect a game mechanic to cater to rl emergencies and corner cases like this, especially if said mechanic has such a grave impact on those in the game itself. 
---
That said, in my opinion, the whole argument of “yeah but what happens to my stuff if my wife gets cancer” is absurdly misplaced and inappropriate. If you ever find yourself in such a terrible situation, internet space pixels should be the last thing on your mind.
---
He came for their local, and I did nothing. It gave me an advantage.
---
Next he came for their cynos, and I did nothing. It made bombing easier.
---
Now he has come for me covert ops cloak. And there is no one to speak for me.
---
ChAoS!!11!1!1!!!
---
How does this photo fuel my Sansha faction battleships?
---
Thanks Chinese Overlords for making botting so much more profitable in null!
---
I can confirm, was there the other day with my stratios, pushed dscan and bam, 3 myrmidons, 30 seconds later, NOTHING. Clocked up, stood there 5 minutes and continued my way, nullsec has become either blobbers or wastelands.
---
Didn't toby Maguire get the rights or something and they are hashing out a script?
---
You elaborated on exactly one of your seven bullet points in any detail. If you’re so against certain changes, step up and tell us why. 
---
I’m comfortable putting my own ideas out there for criticism, so please do the same. To start, why do you disagree with raising the damage cap against structures? Why are you against booshing off of tether on citadels? And what irreplaceable utility is there in allowing citadels on gates? As I explained, the same could be accomplished with a cloaked scout. The only difference is that with the changes I proposed, there some risk in doing that and you have to pay a sub cost. 
---
Go on. I’m waiting.
---
There is a lot of value in killing structures... But it doesn't match the cost of actually killing them
---
So 3 salty people say chori is RMTing.. and people get banned for RMTing left and right.. and chori doesn't... maybe 3 people that left the organization are just bitter or offended since chori has been a piece of shit on more then one occasion.. which doesn't proof anything. And if those 3 people had ANYTHING and are willing to talk about it openly.. why is noone bringing anything forth toget him banned?
---
I think your biggest problem here is knowing what fights to pick to avoid getting blobbed.
---
Besides that, try to kite/mjd away to split them up and use scram/grappler/web to hold ships down after you manage to split some of them in case you are blobbed (if you though BCs were rough in that sense, you are in for an unpleasant surprise).
---
As for killing order I would go: Logi &gt; Ewar (include any not heavy tanked scram) &gt; Squishy dps &gt; Tanky shit. If you see something you can one shot go for it in between targets, thinks like dessies deal a lot of dps for their size but have shit for tank.
---
Thank you! It sounds like having a brawler short range ship (like my ham Tengu) is actually a lot riskier because of the warp in spot, that’s why I’m always aligned while fighting rats, with brief moments of burning back towards them to get in range.  Anyhow, VNI with sentries at range seems like a decent less risky trick.  May I ask what your “travel” fit is then?
---
We have someone in corp who will be stationed out there for research in the coming months. Maybe we can get him to log in.
---
If you plan on baiting in a sig you could try to make a perch 150-160km off from the direction you come in initially. Or make it from anything else that seems plausible, like the only pos or upwell structure or so for example. Chances are they might come from that direction. And depending on their distance you might be able to warp right on top of them.
---
The main issue with citadels is fucking moon timers and that the vulnerability period doesn't scale or shift whatsoever.  Currently it always come out of RF at exactly the defender's prime time and day of their choosing (for armor timer), and the vulnerability period only scales with the type of structure. Asset safety and all the other shit non-withstanding, this is the primary issue with trying to kill structures.  I really could care less about any other factor than being forced to wake up at 3AM on a tuesday to kill an astrahous in my space. 
---
* Make the vulnerability period scale with ADM, inversely if its in hostile zov
---
* Make the timer come out at the same time it began to be attacked, and at a fixed number of days after. 
---
Boom, now ADMs and sov matter for structures, and different timezones can't troll each other with structures.
---
Because they spend less time bitching about it.
---
Low power already skips the armor timer. 
---
Tethering is the solution to docking games, and is not that big of a deal.
---
I'm not saying that... you're using a slippery slope falacy.
---
I agreed with OP in principle. Citadel is way too spammy. If Citadel is like the POS, limited on how many can be placed in a given system, I might be little more lenient toward safety. 
---
But with the current system Citadels can be spammed all over the place in the system. With Time zone tanking and time gap between each timer and etc., citadel bashing is too grindy. 
---
Why current asset safety is required when current citadel mechanic is already OP?
---
I mean you can’t have everything.  What happened to Eve Online’s motto?  Don’t fly things you can’t afford to lose. 
---
Nowadays, people hoard stuff in the citadel because they know they can’t lose their stuff.
---
You say you literally quit. How would you figuratively quit?
---
and most of those got downvoted.  Shocker
---
Well you did use illness as an example, and that exact argument has been used by others (in this thread and others).
---
Thank you for the input!  I had realized my problem with being blobbed was failing to avoid the blobs a while ago.  There's one issue with that.  If I avoid the blobs, which is very very easy to do, I basically refuse any fight from Ushra Kahn, Did He Say Jump, The Congregation, Sideways and Tactless, Sons of Black Rise, and any and all corporations within those alliances.
---
I tried that for a night.  Played for 6 hours and killed two frigates.  Very exciting.  At this point in EVE's lifecycle it seems you either fight the blob or you simply don't get to play at all because everyone has joined the blob.  It's incredibly boring avoiding the blob, but incredibly frustrating fighting against it so I'm kinda stuck.  I figure the best course of action is to learn to beat it and that's what I've been trying to do by learning BS PVP.  It is quite the uphill climb however.
---
If you were no longer a CCP employee and decided to rejoin eve. Which Alliance would you choose or what activities would you do?
---
I’m a pretty new player (2.5m skill points) and you just inspired the hell out of me.
---
Basically the resistances are what you want to look at, also i get 500+ EHP/s, its probably skill related  
---
The whole point of the tank is the resistances can tank part of the damage, and the passive regen does the rest. I had a problem with EM damage until i added the EM ward.
---
shit, i'm sorry
---
I don’t think this will force tons of people into NPC structures. NPC structures will always be great as forward staging areas for capitals, black ops, raiding, etc. They are also good as a temporary refugee camp. 
---
They are not very good for sovereign null sec groups to live in, for the following reasons:
---
1. If the NPC structures have more expensive and less efficient services, then they are not very desirable for doing as much inside them. This is especially true for markets, refining, and manufacturing. These costs and inefficiencies can also be easily made even less desirable if necessary.
---
2. You can be bubble camped into an NPC station.
---
3. You cannot tether on the NPC structure.
---
4. You cannot store Supercapitals in an NPC structure.
---
5. Other players can screw with your market.
---
Agree with all of these tbh
---
I remember an op or two in 2008 where I had to fit tank to "counter" Lotka Volterra's titan - an Avatar, I believe it was. Never saw it on grid, only in directional scan. First time seeing a titan on grid in TQ was just last month!
---
You clearly have never jumped to a cyno in TiDi.
---
Always Eve Vegas. Always.
---
Can i give you isk for this reply?
---
Yea cramitchurchy is a real preachy asshole.
---
One way to dictate fights is to crash gate but hold your jump for a few seconds while as many people as possible aggress you.  With battleship EHP you can take it, then when you jump through you have a minute to clear tackle and burn to range, or even snipe one or two and gtfo, before the rest can follow.
---
Another thing I'm not seeing people say is that you won't always be on one target with all your modules.  In a case where you are fighting a group with 1-2 logi and you have neuts, neut the logi and shoot something like a thorax to clear dps.  Sometimes just webbing a frigate scares them off while you're hitting something else.  This will vary hugely from fit to fit, but in general you want your point/scram/web on the same thing as your guns, neuts on the same target if it is active tanked, otherwise on logi/ewar/cap-hungry dps (like an omen navy) and your drones either on the same target as your guns or chasing tackle that your guns can't hit. 
---
If only one ship has you scrammed, you can also try to neut it and mjd out, or time neut+guns to one-shot tackle (if you get lucky and their mwd cycles off). Multitasking like this while managing your tank is a ballet, but it's the key to maximizing your fit in brawl scenarios.
---
Ehh, then once pos’s are fully gone no small alliance will own supers.
---
Continue to pay the sub but only log into r/eve 😃
---
Is there video of this?

Fankly I’m surprised they aren’t setting up pods on an offline Raitaru 1000km off gate like everyone else.  Then the pod can’t be killed

You want to give a stat to eve players to see how naughty they are?

I mean... You do you, but that will lead to headaches.
---
we actually need system jammers chage
---
Removing asset safety effectively pushes everyone back into NPC structures with anything they aren't actively using atm. It's about where "home" is.  
---
Yes structures are preferable to live in... we want people to live in structures that can be destroyed locking away access from their assets for days to weeks. That was the trade off that made most people ok with the shit from Outposts to structures.   
---
removing in system asset safety? that's a possibility, weeks of being deprived goods and requiring a hefty isk penalty to losing a fight isn't bad.  
---
Removing it from medium structures? very much more plausible since they replaced POSes anyway.  
---
But the dream that somehow we're going to have a functional game if keepstars are dropping titans is laughable and gets an automatic downvote from me every time.
---
I never considered neuting the logi, thanks!  I'll definitely try that next time.  Gate crashing is something I completely forgot about and will have to try next time as well.  Seems the most important thing for this is to know what every single ship on grid is capable of in terms of tank and dps.  I'll just have to keep whelping ships until I memorize them all I suppose!

Interesting o/
---
I wonder if the amount of SPs someone already has affects the formula chance somehow O.o
---
By the way, was today the last day for this event?
---
Not sure if they could code it, but an Asset Safety Hangar like one of the corp hangars.  Or an Asset Safety station container.
---
You can keep what you want in there but it has a space limitation.  it will still hold most of your most valuable stuffs, but lots of other stuff will drop, including the high m3, which can be hauled if someone can hold grid, which presumably the attacker can.
---
Who is using sabres as hard cynos to bring caps to a grid held by hostile caps/supers?
---
Just because someone may have gotten away with it once doesn't mean it works with any consisteny.
---
Don't feel like it, deal with it vOv
---
CCP already takes about 15% of the items' value as the fee to get them out of asset safety again. They could just give that partially or completely to the people involved in the destruction of the station. You know, like npc bounty gets shared if multiple people kill it? Shouldn't be too complicated.
---
You could even allow people to blow up their own stations (for example because they leave a region) and earn a tax from the inactive/former members still having stuff in it.
---
The killmarks on Triglavian hulls are tiny. On the Kiki, they are on the middle-right hull piece, just above the "hardpoints."

Just have another bot scanning for wormholes &amp; send more pods to warp to them.
---
It's not that hard to scan, I don't think people would have a super rough time making a little bot setup for it.
---
If a citadel is unfueled (for x amount of time), it should be killable anytime. *Citadel spam solved*
---
For the same reason the 'Forged of Fire' didn't ended well.      
---
To old to such level of commitment
---
Need to get some isk out of the game?
---
Why not have to pay all the upwell personal to enable teathering? Also those dudes are quite handy when it comes to damage control, so if you dont pay you lose 20% armor and structure hitpoints and  your damage is reduced.
---
Dayum that looked fun, gj snuff bros. Fair play to Ranger Regiment for deploying titans as well. 
---
What was with the constant stealth bomber killmails from the smartbombs by the way? were they just warping straight into you at zero? caught in the bubble or something? pretty weird.
---
Awesome thank you guys, looks like eve just screwed me again

I’ll have to shoot some more down and maybe I’ll get a killmark after a few more kills :)

Man, imagine being that up yourself that you think your absolute trash posting is something people need to brigade to get downvoted.
---
Hint: start using a few braincells during the writing process of your posts and you might find they get received better.
---
I would have thought you guys learned your lesson with how the blackout has gone. Extreme short term gain, long term loss... of content.
---
Is it more powerful than Texas law?
---
I’d rather see a more active approach. Similar to, or combined with, ship insurance. Insure your ships and they will be asset safetied for the duration of the insurance. Items cannot be insured, so they would drop if not moved.
---
For people who do not insure, or let the insurance lapse, then follow WH drop mechanics.
---
As far as players disappearing for several months and maybe or maybe not coming back...I hate the idea of balancing the game around people who aren’t playing.
---
Stations still exist in high low npcnull and Thera. Move the shit there. Or if you can’t be assed to move it and not sure when you’ll be back, Insure and manual asset safety. 🤷‍♂️
---
That awkward moment when you warp at 70 to a celestial and de-cloak a person that did the same thing.

Well killahbee is a big pussy, he might grow some cojones at a certain point

Well he spoke the truth that he  didnt see the titans... cuz he is a retard he didnt mention

Any removal of asset saftey has to come with a removal of invincible stations, or the change is pointless, and just some extra logistical bullshit.
---
Thanks for all the fun info guys!
---
Some advice.  In previous comments you said you were only going to relic or data sites, but if you were in fact going to these core runner sites, the link states they are grouped under gas sites.  While they do require data analyzers they arent data sites.  A lot of people are willing to help but not clearly stating the signatures you are scanning can lead to confusion.
---
Exploration can mean a lot of things so if you are looking to do relic and data sites it states what they are when you scan them in the probe scanner under group.  Any faction relic or data site will not have rats with the exception of ghost sites which you can read about here.
---
 https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Ghost_Sites
---
That's exactly right - land in site, MJD away from the landing spot.  Or if not in a plex, warp off to a planet/moon/poco at some range so they split up chasing you.  You can often kill the smaller stuff before heavy DPS catches up, then just repeat.
---

  PURGE THE XENOS
---
They don't have SRP because they don't hold/live in significant nullsec space to rent out or tax members. 
---
Snuff's main attraction is they're based in lowsec and "generally" fairly neutral and tend to be less risk averse with their capitals/supers/titans. So they tend to attract a lot of people with the same mindset. 
---
In order to not just live but flourish in lowsec you gotta be fairly self sufficient and have an independent stable source of income. Snuff is kinda the extreme end of that mindset, its members can survive without SRP because they've never expected it in the first place.
---
Do u run adaptive invul fields?
---
We had someone at eve down under ask CCP Mimic "when are you guys fixing TIDI?!" She replied: we do but you guys keep adding more players every time we improve it!
---
So you want a 15% isk faucet on all assets in any citadel?
---
This kind of 'give the rewards to the players' was tried before, and resulted in a massive exploit vector on the order of trillions of isk.
---
I can already see at least 1 exploit vector with this system, and it does nothing at all to stop the 'problems with asset saftey' and just gives some isk to some shitheads because they think some ISK will motivate them to bash some shit.
---
Hint: It won't.
---
And more obvious to onlookers.

What's so bad about the old way?!? /s

In this case, I was trying to do it more dynamic (at first it's length was 12 minutes), changing music on changing something on video and those bad people from Magix broke event velocity mechanism, when I was able to adjust video speed with pressed Ctrl easily, usually I matched them for one track. Also, in this case, I was bored on every track except for the last one, but the video ended on it, I think I will use it in the next video.

It doesn't really matter unlike what these other people are telling you. The market is flooded with bots and rich people. Making money on the market is a pain in the ass, just gotta find a line somewhere you can walk and hope someone else doesn't inject a bot into it.

Hyper hels are faster than almost any cruiser even combat fit. In travel fit with full hyperspatial lows not much short of hyper dictors and interceptors can keep up with them. The geographical distance you can cover with them in a short time is quite impressive. 
---
I'm personally not a huge fan of the new fighter mechanics but caps definitely dont have to be slow. I think the gating hyper nid will make a resurgence in post-cyno eve since it's going to be quite hard to lock them down and even with the nerfs fighters still shred subcaps.

Pando had a stream, and there's at least a few recordings from snuffs side floating around. I got occupied sorting sub targets though so mines not all that interesting to watch, but I think there's a titan pov being edited atm.
---
A computer or server can run so many clients until it's at peak. If before they could run 50 bot accounts all farming and now this has dropped to 35 with 15 sitting on gates for Intel that alone will drop income. 
---
Now add that they will be more concentrated in fewer systems. And are easier to trick and kill with the nolocal. You'll reduce it even more. 
---
Now let's say this bot network was making the guy $500. And now it only makes 300 after the change. But this other game still makes 500. There is no reason to stick to eve. 
---
Isk supply on the black market will drop. Demand stays the same. Price goes up. This wouldn't be bad if it wasn't for the price ceiling black market isk has due to plex you can buy from ccp. The closer the price gets to the ceiling the more people that will decide to start buying plex instead.
---
I agree. I fully expect to see those :-)
---
It’s going to be a nice meta shake up I think.
---
Excited to see what future chaos mechanics are on the way
---
So by that logic we should remove citadels from null too. You can still do all the things you do there today, you just have to travel a bit first. I mean, I don’t live there, so who cares about the people that do. They’ll just have to go somewhere else.

Specifically quit? I don't know. Cyno announcement is when i finally gave up on ccp and walked away. They could have implemented cyno changes so many different ways, but this one was the worst thing they could have done. Like 1 ship thru a t1 cyno and 5 through a t2 or ships per hull size or put a mass limit on them or shortened their timers to a few seconds or fixed citadels before taking away cynos or fixwd on of the hundreds of other problems with the game or killed market bots or gotten rid of skill injectors or almost anything besides what they did to the primary logistical tool in eve.
---
What the fuck is your definition of an isk faucet? There is no isk being created with asset safety. It is simply rerouted either into the abyss of what it is now or into rewards for blowing up structures as the OP is asking for.

Oh no, this is just the wormhole chaos amigo.
---
Target caller probably sorting by distance if I had to guess.  
---
Or prioritizing them because of their location on grid or something.  
---
Tank of the target is a consideration but not the only one.
---
&gt; The goal is to stop them doing it, and we aren't going to achieve that by fucking with game mechanics
---
This is fundamentally wrong. Botting exists because of game mechanics. We can't remove the overview or make Eve less amenable to botting software. Banning and bot detection is playing whackamole with people who can immediately spin up a new bot for next to nothing.  Literally all we can do it change game mechanics. If you don't like the changes; tough. Come up with a better way to do it or accept that the same playstyle that appeals to sov null residents - low-effort, horizontally scalable pve - is perfect for bots.
---
With those modules they are not even worth wasting time on hunting...
---
Why did you warp directly into a Succubus, if you didnt want to fight a Succubus.
---
I said this the day blackout went into effect and got downboated into the abyss for it.
---
Astero has ok speed and great sig. When the bomb is about to land just turn on your repper and make sure you are moving max speed MWD off. You need to remember its like 2 minutes minium between bombing runs which is plenty of time to rep up. If he's bombing he can't come into point range anyway aside from the fact that bombers are quite squishy. Esp if the bomber is dual scram fit to catch 4 stabbed asteros. Dual scram, prop and a paint leaves no room for tank.

---
&gt; Not that hard to bot using a locator agent.
---
So what's the solution there, then? Keep all bots docked as long as the character is located in the system? Because that'd be an easy way to permanently lock up bots in a single system.
---
Nobody goes to Yulai looking for Supers though...
---
They should jump them to like 25km off the Jita undock.

Nope, just shield extenders and EM ward II for mids. The lows are all Shield power relay IIs.
---
Small gang v small gang is super fun, but the unfortunate reality I've experienced from a handful of corps I've been in is usually just being on the other side of the blob.  I always grow tired of it very quickly and out of around 10 or so PVP corps I've been in, I've yet to enjoy a single one. I don't want to knock anyone's play style but it is mind numbingly boring sitting on a gate for hours on end waiting for "content" to show up in the form of some poor frigate soloer who gets insta blapped.  The few times any of the corps I was in did manage to get group v group going it was always a lot of fun, but it seems that's only as frequently as once a week or so.
---
While this is a lot of bot activity, it does still go back to the fact that the botters can't exactly lock out things for certain and have no accurate way to track something entering leaving or not. And if something doesn't leave within X time, there's the obvious question on how long until the bots are supposed to go back to "work".
---
All the things you mentioned are possible, but still make the current bot setups easier to actually pick on as actual players than before blackout, no? Even if it ends up revolving around log off/ log on mechanics, there's nothing bots can actively do to get to the zero risk from before.
---
Make Yulai Great Again
---
Possibly, but the logging off isn't going to be easily circumvented in any way.
---
Yeah I saw the t1 fighters, unless i mistook the t2 fighters for stealth bombers.

Well I mainly use it for ratting and mining. I also take Triglavian parts to Jita every couple of days.
---
*Remove asset safety to incentivize destruction 
---
*Smaller citadels should have one less timer
---
disagreed, at least assuming you say "citadel" but mean structure... raitaru's are the de facto industry facility now since ccp made them plainly better. CCP also incentivized / requires spamming them, due to the number of rigs.
---
Meanwhile industry is also something that takes time and lots of investment. Making raitaru's super easy to kill or going into "all services shut down" mode from the first attack would effectively make industry something nobody can do unless you're a big alliance able to drop and defend (well, bribe the big entities) to allow your structure to exist.
---
Look at TTT in perimeter; do we really want to have all of industry locked down to being only possible in structure owned by the biggest blobs in the game while they agree not to fight one another over the cash cow?
---
I didn't actually track the data, but running it every day on 4 characters, I would estimate that it was something like:
---
* 75% - 10k
---
* 20% - 25k
---
* 5% - 50k
---
&gt;yeah so strange that it finds power to power a massive Tractor Beam in low-power 
---
That's not really a good train of logic there. Should the weapons be disabled too? What about your own ship, how does it find power to activate all those modules if it's not burning fuel?
---
The answer is that it's not just a dead brick in space and has power for base functionality regardless. Tethering and docking is base functionality, in this case. Wanting that changed is your opinion but trying to blame it on "it shouldn't have power" is a bit silly.
---
Yes, it has been a long time ago.
---
https://i.imgur.com/mPQsKwK.jpg might change out the bottom row with a good ultra wide.
---
They’d have to be subbed for that to work.
---
Who uses their PvE ships for PvP? Regardless of size?
---
You don’t get plex anymore right?
---
IF the cost to operate the bot is lower than the benefit then running the bot will always be the right choice. In order to actually stop the bots you have to reduce their income by so much that they can't RMT the isk for enough money to cover the electricity costs to bot. 
---
Then you run into a relational deflation problem: the lower everyone's income is the more each isk is worth in terms of real money. Meaning that at some point their income in terms of real money may actually go back up simply because everyone's income is so low that only the bots have the patience to earn isk.
---
Haven't flown any caps, never really cared for big ships in any space game. I like flying smaller, more agile ships.
---
Are you dumb? These stupid RMTers don't do PvP.
---
They are players who aren't even playing anymore whether banned or just inactive so they couldn't do that.
---
Actually take a look at the titan pilots killboard
---
Hell, May 2018... prehistoric times
---
Find a corp in low/null/wh and talk to the people. If you haven't tried it yet nobody can tell you if you're gonna like their playstyle. But the most important part of all these playstyles is to have people to play together with. Outside of hisec you make your own game. And its more fun in a small (or big) community.

What server is this on?
---
Remember how in the middle ages the most effective way to use a castle was to drop it in enemy territory and hang a sign on the door that says they can only attack at 3am on a Wednesday?
---
If you never get eyes on them you can never see their names.
---
The myrms don't need to be omega either.
---
Is the part two also going to be 2mins long
---
Brute forcing the scan isn't even something that's needed. If you double click on the sig in your probe window the scan map will center on the item. Then you just drag the probes to the center of the screen. Rinse repeat with reducing the scan size each time till you have scanned it. The only thing it needs to be able to actually identify is where the initial probe starting position is and what number the item is in the probe window list.
---
Overheating is a thing. A regular T2 long point Will give you 28 KM overheated.
---
You can bomb and be in point range..
---
The locator lets you know if they're logged in or not.  Your gate bots let you know if they've left the system or not via gates.
---
At that point, it's up to the botter to decide if they want to risk it...in that one system.
---
I dont really think so either. It could be made better but it's not critically broken or anything
---
You can look at it a different way and enjoy the chaos. Believe me way back when there was crazy chaos every day, like setting your alarm for 3am when you had work at 7 just to blast down a POS during off time and making it through the day on 4h sleep.   
---
I've been gone but apparently things got pretty stable for awhile. Things are shaking up now. Reason to return!
---
Not Sure. I will Probably post a larger video when I have more time to get it all worked up.
---
Going there and getting asploded is the best way. Just learn from any/all mistakes made!  (I may have anchored an Athanor in WH space only to jump to HS for supplies only for the hole to collapse, thought my alt was in hole but wasn't...) Been an on off player similar to you but had, like you, only done the HS carebear stuff.
---
Got back into eve recently and  I knew I had to try new stuff. Have an Athanor based in LS and do frequent explo day tripping wormholes and Null.
---
Game has been alot more fun this time around as a result.
---
The corp logo system is definitely a big thing internally. A lot of groups would like to stand out a bit more.
---
Titan was one of these things on my list. I got a Ragnarok. Fitted it up. Then I bosoned a lone explorer in null with a drag bubble. Then I deployed it to alliance staging for it to eat dust for more then a month before I decided to sell it again for a small profit.
---
I switched to dread ratting when i have the will to rat :D
---
Yes, it was in May 2018. Correct.
---
I’d be comfortable with medium structures being treated like POS were.  If its low power, no timer.  If its fueled, one timer.
---
I have never finished scamming with courier contracts in the haulers channel until the channel disbanded. Only got to like 80%... even scamming the owner didn't finish it off.
---
No seriously...
---
- I have never done Burner missions
---
- I have never done lowsec/highsec Incursions  
---
- I have never not laughed at poor people
---
The good guys win again
---
Everytime some corp mates start boasting about their venture kill I just think "why...?"
---
Yessir
---
Because you usually want to fit for a specific tank, not mixing both shield and armor. When you focus on one type you can make it way stronger than a mix of both with the added benefit of free med/low slots for either utility or damage mods/other passive upgrades.
---
Lots of credit to Sort for such a great job. Glad snuffed finally took the fight. Special thanks to RR for their support, Caladarius, DHS combat wombat, and all the others. I had a ton of fun, as did, I think everyone in DeadCo.
---
Armor slows you down, shields make you a bigger target.
---
Guy ask for RMT supers. Not all botters do RMT
---
He said "7 chinese", so he is not wrong there.... wasn't "vs" though. With vs it would be 5 vs 4, as mentioned above already.
---
It's nice to see people can still read. :)
---
Are you allowed to report this content if it is from an EVE group but within a different group such as discord? Would that be handled by discord mods?
---
Sure but the bomber is then vulnerable to being pointed back. And considering that the bomber is more less tanky than the astero is and the bomber's main weapons apply poorly to the astero staying on grid with it when it can point you is probably a death sentence.
---
Hella salt bud. I desalinated that shit myself.
---
But seriously, "Ingredients include all that are conceivable as having been brought through the EVE gate", thats pretty low effort. They even pound signed it, #EVECOOKOFF.
---
KK, concentrate on this cooking contest, not the shit going on in the corner over there.
---
Someone make me some Minmatar Longpig!
---
Vanquishers aren't that common. It isn't that easy to grind for a 300b ship tbh. My grind to the Molok was fucking miserable....
---
because i dont spend money or isk on ingame cosmetics
---
Oh how I wish CCP would just add them to the LP store. Just make their material costs extremely high. This whole NPC sotiyo thing has been a let down from the start (run over 20 of them dating back to the first one).
---
Alternatively, just make the loot only fit in a freighter...put some real risk on the field if you want that dope ass loot. Then still make the BPC have a high material cost. Right now there just is no real reason to run it.
---
I don't understand. You say you see fleets everywhere from 10 different corps. Then when you are in one they suddenly disappear? I mean. Just join a Corp and make the content. Roam around solo and if you.see a gang call up your buddies to fight them. 
---
Being in a Corp does not suddenly mean you have to gatecamp 24/7. You can do your own thing aswel. Find the contend for your Corp instead of being the next leecher that joined just waiting for someone else to serve you contend
---
what system are they using ? asking for a friend
---
So I make a new char, transfer it a bunch of items that I arificially manipulated to be high in value, but low in actual value, and then I put fuck loads of them in a citadel, and blow the citadel up, and I get 15% of the value of the items inside, while my alt sends a bunch of useless crap to ccp-jail.
---
Net result, I just made 15% isk from CCP on some things that are unsellable and have no value but what I assign them.
---
I recent item I have several of, was sold for 10,000 isk.  The value of the container I have of this item was valued at 600,000,000,000 isk for about a week.
---
Even except for Delve/Querious.
---
If it helps, being bombed is also terrible in a bomber.  MWD means certain death, not MWDing means probable death*.  The hunters become the hunted.
---
*If using a common high dps torp/bomb fit with minimal tank.
---

Dark killed an extra titan worth of FAX though and the (comparatively) cheap fits on all the titans and dreads play the ISK balance there. 
---
If you wanna own up to things, it was a close draw. A huge coalition managed to get a draw out of one low-sec alliance aided by one chinese corporation and a subcap fleet of bombers. Actually balanced fight for once.
---
He came for their local, and I said nothing. It gave me an advantage.
---
He came for their cynos, and I said nothing. It made bombing easier.
---
He came for their Vexors, and I said nothing. I called them "bots" and "Krabs".
---
Now he has come for my covert ops cloak. And there is no one to speak for me.
---
Don't get your knickers in a twist, it's fictional. ChAoS!
---
I imagine that just replacing items via spawning them is frowned upon because of potential economic damage. Are there any major items or assets you are typically not allowed to, or dislike refunding?
---
&gt;\*Remove asset safety to incentivize destruction
---
For a majority of structures, this will mean nothing. An empty structure with no asset safety continues to drop nothing. 
---
Also, the fact that there are *plenty* of structures out there that will drop billions of isk in goodies, with no one scrambling to go get them, tells me simple carrots aren't going to change the dynamics much.
---
&gt;\*Citadels shouldn't be anchorable on gate grids  
---
&gt;\*No more tethering on low-power structures
---
Sure, fair enough. 
---
&gt;\*Booshing off tether should be possible again
---
Maybe I'm forgetting something, but I don't ever recall this being possible, much less intentional. Kinda defeats the purpose of tethering at all if its that easy to circumvent.
---
&gt;\*Smaller citadels should have one less timer
---
Absolutely, and decrease the RF duration itself. These two day *minimums* are absolutely rediculous. Should never have been a thing for the weakest structures. 
---
&gt;\*Buff structure defense capabilities. Make them more dangerous but less tanky.
---
Not really. At best they should be useful for deterring pests and making their immediate area unsafe, not to do the job of the defenders for them. I'd say that the citadel line of defenses is stronger than it should be anyway. All the other sructures are probably closer to where they should be. I'd prefer that you could actually shoot the weapons or modules offline again.
---
I was meeted and greeted twice on different accounts and can say it is very helpful and encouraging.
---
I've yet to try it but seems different  but also very lucrative
---
Something much better than FOF to kill drones: Smartbombs. You even get to have actually useful ships since all it takes is a utility high slot.
---
Well it's mostly that there's no real incentive to build them that makes them expensive
---
but lol you aren't wrong
---
Being fuckholes to eachother who still shake hands at meetups is what EVE is all about, fuckhole.
---
Using cheaper fits. And having larger numbers. And us feeding more FAX. GG GOTG overall.
---
autists dont understand nuance well
---
Caps suck. This is why I don't play any more.
---
Frigates rule!
---
My understanding is mining botting drives down item costs(more supply), ratting botting drives inflation and isk cost up(more cash).
---
CCP should tackle ratting bots.
---
WE have a structure in one of our systems which is 4AM Wednesday morning CBA with that we just leave it...
---
The questions should be why you are not fighting.
---
Fair enough. You should use their sell cost and not their buy cost though. Uninjecting remains the same at all levels.
---
Snuff wanted a fight. GOTG provided.
---
I have no idea how you plan to manipulate a worthless item to somehow be high in value. Are you saying you want to trade civilian miners between alts for absurd prices or something? And do you think you could screw up the ingame "estimated price" thing asset safety seems to work with?
---
Buy a Dell optiplex 7010. (Ebay) Put a new psu in it and a rx 580 and boom. You have a budget badass
---
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh most people that rat in supers and tits. Why do you think most people in goons pvp fit there carriers.
---
