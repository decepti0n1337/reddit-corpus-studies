---
I showed my guys the whole logs from the chat but only because you were making it out on your comms as if it was some betrayal but it really wasnt asking a neutral if theyre going to kill you and then expecting an answer is dumb.
---
Ofc you get downvoted to the point your reply is hidden, simply for being right. 
---
Good ol r/eve mentality. Anything pro-goon is bad.
---
Exploration in npc null can be good, especially Stain and Venal, but if you’re on during peak times you’ll have way too much competition. I guess you could camp them and try to kill explorers for loot, but once you have a couple explorers on your kb people stop running sites with you in system at all. 
---
Test bros are bros, not pets.
---
That’s what I meant, should have been more specific sorry 
---
we have been nuetral for three years ;p

---
get used to that if you're gonna operate in PB
---
tl;dr: vily assumes something neither said nor implied, becomes permanently salty after it goes different than expected
---
PGL did
---
tl;dr: vily's ego can't handle getting dunked so he goes into Fox News mode to scapegoat someone besides himself
---
look at it this way, 1 titan and 1 nyx ( armor LUL ) is a cheap price to pay for the realisation that snuff doesn't have permanent friends  
---
now they can get real supers and you're free to dunk snuff's shit
---
got me some sauce?
---
So, when do is the next round of the tournament?     
---
        
---
Props for the wrestling trophy :)
---
No, it's pretty weird you fucking nerd.
---

---
who 
---
&gt;before the crippling autism diagnosis.
---
Goons or TEST?
---
&gt; snuff traditionally has been good to their word with us dating back to vale. There was alot of built up trust. 
---
Didn't snuff already show a willingness to hunt your supers/titans whilst you were moving up to Oij? And then with very non-committal answers from Hy.
---
But hey sitting here with hindsight and without full logs from your years communicating it's easy to say you shouldn't have trusted them.
---
fixed it thanks.
---
its official we're disbanding
---
Mind if i just sit quietly and stare uncomfortably?
---
Maybe "interacting" is an ambiguous word. The scout cannot affect the in game system they are in without putting themselves in danger. 
---
Being able to obtain intel is an aspect of eve. You aren't being obstructed from playing the game because your opponent knows you exist, and you probably are more likely to undock those ships in the first place if you know where the enemy is and what ships they are in, using your own scouts. You can even go into further depth by trying to trick hostile scouts by changing your route or temporarily staging from a system that they would not check, or waiting until the hostiles are well tackled before undocking and showing your hand.
---
It's not a broken mechanic, it's a part of the game which both sides of a fight have access to, to some degree. You are correctly describing a mechanic of eve, but not one that needs to be "fixed".
---
This is so heart warming, well done for turning things around and congrats with your engagement. Credit to the people that helped guide you, some genuinely awesome people.
---
Used to play eve flying with the PL dudes. Much respect to them. I’ve always wanted to come back to eve but my character is stuck deep in a carrier in nullsec after I went inactive, cba getting him out to be honest. Some very fond memories from EVE and I love reading all the stories that keep the game interesting with player driven content that the developers still to this day seems to encourage which is great.
---
One thing I’ve learnt outside of eve, positivity breads positivity, keep it up. Peace!
---
Players are so needy these days just wait. In a few months some unannounced nonsensical "balance changes" will just magically fucking appear in SISI about 3 days before the dev post announcing those changes is released. CCP will ask for feedback and wait to receive it before completely ignoring it and doing exactly what they originally planned. The outcome will be predictable and disappointing and around Sept/Oct CCP will announce they are well aware of how bad the capital balance is and we should all just hang in there because they will be addressing it shortly.

Just stop eating and sleeping, its all about priorities

Did it feel as good for you as it did for him? 
---
We clapped a Fortizar in a C2 last night and it dropped 40 bill in loot including 2 freighters that were used to scoop everything up and dock at an astrahaus in freeport mode owned by the same corp lol 
---
Wow, no hesitation from him either.
---
Like a horrible turd that just wont flush. 
---
You called? 
---
We don't have to. We can play something else
---
yes
---
so to get this straight: going after your supers was okay because we're not blue but 'lying' about it was betrayal? what did you expect, for us to stand down because you convoed hy? You also implied a 'spy' told you that hy showed us those chatlogs. why would you need a spy in snuff if we were supposed to trust each other?
---
It goes back and forth every few months between:
---
  "Goons are shit"
---
  "LOL TAPI"
---
  "TYPICAL PL BEING AFK"
---
  "GOTG LMAO THEY'RE TERRIBLE"
---
  "YOU'RE ELEET NC"
---
  "CCPLS"
---
  "GRR [botting] [wildcard issue]"
---
  Right now it's LOL TAPI because we welped caps and a few other unfortunate events :shrug:
---
"going after your supers was okay because we're not blue but 'lying' about it was betrayal?"
---
correct.
---
&gt; I thought that people got up in arms about things in this game being 100% risk free. Or is that only when such a mechanic doesn't benefit you?
---
So when i said this earlier it was 100% right on the nose.
---
Or gatecamping
---
I prefer evemails usually because they are ingame. Yes, yes, intel. But who gives a fuck. 
---
Gofis and cone were part of the titan as well.  You could give them a mention. 
---
&gt; Inferno video
---
&gt; 
---
I've managed to miss this in all this time, what a chilling trailer! Goosebumps! :D
---
What else is new
---
Wat
---
Correct. That was our max fax form. Who needs logi when you just dps your way out. Don’t need to rep when nothing is shooting you cause it dead :think:
---
Yeah.  The only fix for this is to make DSTs not able to fit cargo mods, because it's terminally stupid.
---
Fixing the "i'm going to put billions and billions of blueprints in one ship" and that ship being a highly catchable DST, where the value exceeds any possible viable tank ratio, that's not possible.
---
Seriously, make a few trips, and use a harder to catch ship.  DST has a hard limit on value you can carry, because you're guaranteed to be scouted and a value put on your head.  If you are worth more than 2 or 3x the cost to kill you, you *will* be killed.
---
Use a BR, maybe you can get through without being scouted at least, if you fit for rapid align and use a cloak.
---
I guess, but then you're locked in place and can't warp off/cloak etc. That just to me seems like a dangerous action anyways. Regardless - swapping a cyno out is horribly dumb.
---
So when someone drops 25 caps and kills 150 subs that means caps are broken, but when someone drops 25 caps and they die to 150 subs the subs are dirty blobbers for not bringing even numbers....

Presumably because ninja power or some shit. I think it might fit into some of the DED plexes you can probe down that AFs/T3Ds can't.
---

---
Best line of that clip.
---
Dreddit is Recruiting.
---
Sabin, despite the nerd rage, is a big hearted bro. Good to see life turned around for him, and I'm sure he'll pay it forward in leagues.
---
&gt;welped caps
---
And it still blows my mind that that is a huge shittalking point. What alliance doesn't welp caps? Its insurmountable how many caps goons have welped. Shit, sometimes we welp caps *to pass the time because we're bored.*
---
I guess everybody is trying to keep that narrative going that says "All alliances are bad except mine and ccpls"
---
I must join Dreddit!
---
He knows some maneuvers.
---
No kidding. It's remarkably well produced. It shows off the new graphics well because the missile trails were a fantastic addition to the game at that point. The music is custom and perfectly matched to the video. The voiceover is on-point. The message appeals to all of the industrialists like me who want to build shit. It appeals to the guys who want to blow up shit. 
---
It's one of those videos that captures the spirit of eve while the new video captures the literal eve. 
---
Just go on a roam and lose it. Have some fun and give someone else some content. Then come on over to Dreddit and we'll get you setup.
---
Why not just have a FAX in system near where you're fighting so you can have it warp in, light the second it lands and bring in the rest of the capital fleet? FAX tank is good enough to last the 20 seconds you'd need
---
Did you read it, because nowhere in the post or title does it say B4R? Get gud scrub.
---
I think Vily was the first one to publicly call it casino war during a high profile event (Might have been UALX on the Imperium Stream) 
---
LOL..TAPI crying being betrayed? umm sound like you guys forgetting your own history.
---
Because you have to fit 10 pounds of shit into a 5 pound bag knowledge wise. Don't feel bad, just understand it's a struggle and it feels better when you start getting it all in the bag somehow
---
That huginn is like 600 DPS cold no drugs or implants, and it's only t2. Though it needs to be quite close to apply that. It's not exactly LOW damage.
---
TIL Eve was a pve game before zkill.
---
Loot Fairy has moved in and is starting to think of baby names.
---
what
---
  /r/eve have been talking about "caps being the new battleships" this month- then they sperg out when caps die. Either they're cheap and can be thrown away on a whim- Or they are still a valuable, risky asset like in 2010. But hey, rhetoric changes on a dime in this place.
---
 
---
I started playing in Dec like 6 years ago.  About a month later, I was in Asakai in Cal FW and had a titan click jump instead of bridge and got to witness all hell break loose (Battle of Asakai).  That was amazing.  
---
Game's changed a lot since then. 
---
i miss the old trailers, sure they didnt mirror in game gameplay very well...
---
but how many trailers do?
---
and the old EVE trailers were exciting, building story, and attracting people.
---
the new ones, not as memorable. even if they are more accurate to in game.....
---
sometimes fantasy is better than reality. including in trailers
---
What are you gonna do about it vilyboy huh?
---
why the fuck would i read ALL THIS SHIT from a FURRY, no less
---
With the most love possible Eve is sometimes more fun to talk about than it is to play at times so I personally dont mind exciting trailers be in gameplay or cinematic
---
Drama tax sounds good though.
---
/u/resnarh comes to mind as well as a querns maybe. Comment's like this aged real well lol.

Hy is a snake, is why I used every means at my disposal to crush his ass. Hihy

Omg

so it is a top ten anime betrayal aferall..........
---
It's not extortion unless the policy was a secret until after you violated it. Amazing how quickly a sense of morality can sprout when it helps you save ISK!
---
What effort did you really put in for the skills though? You learned the game and different mechanics, how to fly manually and hiw to get space rich there is no doubt. But the for the skillpoints themselfes you only queued them up and waited. Now I have to learn the same things as you (with exceptions due to general gameolay changes of course) the only difference is I can speed uo the waiting a bit. Skillpoints alone are useless if I don't know how to use my ships/skillpoints.
---
I'm so glad I'm in test now Hy, and I'm also glad that I'm just a line member, which means I don't need to setup traps and rape your newly overgrown fleet. But here's a tip for everyone else reading this. SNUFF is hated by all, so easy to get multiple fc's to trap this fool. 
---
upvoted because you know exactly why
---
in what way? Marauders would be the consumate ship for small groups to fight guerilla style in nullsec and would give sub cap groups a meaningful way to stave off caps
---
Can't reply to OP, but this hit me.
---
I wasn't much of a person to worry about, but I was beligerent, up for a fight and not very sober.
---
Shit went down in my life, my mum struggled with cancer, I started drinking for real, Unclesam88 kept me decent. My mother died in our home, we evicted oldNC from the north, I got evicted from my old home by my father, we did weird stuff in AUtz vs Goons in Deklein. 
---
Finfleet, Splockster and LakeEnd saved my life. Priestess keeps me around for pets. 
---
Gnomes salute you. o7
---
I wish Marauders were about half the price they currently are, I might actually be able to afford one then. 
---
You sparked a controversy sir! I believe there is a special place in hell reserved for explorers who fit cargo scanners! *glove slap*  
---
You assume they have a plan or goal? I got muh doubts there...
---
cringe
---
good for you m8, keep on going :)
---
You do you, we have different goals in eve and that's fine. My goal always is the endgame in pretty much any game I play. I see the journey there as fun most of the time, I will however take shourtcuts whenever possible. That being said, what I see as endgame in eve is the possibility to fly every ship there is perfectly and without injectors that would take me years and years. Even now after a little more than two years and spending lots of isk on injectors I'm propably only halfway there.
---
Are you my wife?
---
&gt;It's a neverending source of mirth that companies think any game player is under any obligation to pay subscription for a game, when game designers don't invest in the product.
---
That's some bullshit. Cancel your subscription and make your money talk like an adult instead of laboring with your child-like sense of entitlement. Pretty simple stuff dude.
---
Cool, I haven’t delt with plexes yet, so that’s good to know.
---
Who in YouTube video would use default overview and brackets sorted by name? Blur is probably because that pilot could somehow lead to name of a character used to make that clip (by kill history or something similar).
---
I mean sure but you realise we've killed most of your supers and titans you lost on this Oij deployment prior to this drop and what would you do if tau had convoed you and said "hey are you trying to bait me or going to xyz fight" when you had spent hours prepping to drop him and he just had second hand intel that you were doing something maybe closeby.
---
Of course you can do a lot with low sp. You just can't do it all and that is my goal.
---
They went one up, there's ratting Ishtar at 3:52.
---
pot kettle black.. dude
---
"lifeless" aka "not super fake."
---
Personally I enjoy hype videos but only once I'm enjoying the game already. I know better than to follow clickbait links on the web, and I know better than to try a video game (especially an MMO) because of a snazzy trailer that's really nothing like the game itself.
---
its funny, when you try explain Eve or any other online game for that matter, to those who dont play them, they really dont understand the bonds that can grow, the friendships that can happen.. and the good that can come from it all.  Sure we can all come and wage the external sperg war against each other on reddit.. but at the end of the day .. how many of you wouldn't, if you were able, just pack everything up for a day, drive halfway across the country just to meet up with all the great people you have playing with, waged war against, shit talked on reddit, etc..  This stuff is real
---
I assume you have probs with other free intel too. Like number of rats killed or the ADM level, which you should only get if you hack the ihub or something.
---
Well. Eve trailers are different than other games. They do not have expiration dates. Other games tend to release trailers for expansions and stuff. Many Eve trailers (at least those that aren't 10+ years old) are still representative of the game.
---
So instead of doing more of the same, those real comms trailers, epic stories, and so on, CCP did something different. They made a more introductory one that actually is more explicit on what this game is about. I think it's the right choice. You can always send your friends "This is Eve" to hype them, then send this for a more in-detail introduction.
---
you probably should just unplug at this point... (in game of course)
---
the real cringe is your comment history
---
This is for sure something that is gonna happen. 
---
Why
---
I came back after 4 years inactive and did this. Helped me jump back in a lot quicker than doing it myself. Has been serviceable so far.
---
It is written.
---
Those stats on the Map are kinda fishy too. How does it gather all that info from "lawless space"? But I think Local is the one most abused.
---
good meme
---
Scotty Bloomflower shall rise in greatness again!!
---
I loved this one, very nice
---
that doesn't make any sense, so make sense or fuck off... dude
---
Its no different to being able to buy a character able to do those things. Either way you were throwing money at a problem to fix it. The new way is just more convenient.
---
As someone who brought a bunch of RL reprobates into Eve in this warzone I enjoyed the commentary
---
&gt;cowers in lowsec believing this....
---
make me.. dude.
---
Happy to hear it dude! This game and the relationships I formed pulled me out of the depths of unemployment and depression after I dropped out of grad school. The community in this game is unrivalled
---
depends on the time of year i guess
---
I could totally fit one.  Last thing I did before taking my 3 year break was train Marauders for a Paladin.
---
But yeah I'm crazy poor and have no use for a Paladin right now.  
---
you seem upset dude
---
Please please please boson his astero off the gate somewhere
---
you mean botters have been wasting money buying bot software this whole time when they could just have near2 play the game for them for free?
---
Sabin, I'm so fucking proud of you, dude.  Glad you've got things figured out and made irl your bitch!
---
EFT is easy, everyone does it right.. come on, you know there is a subset of eve players who can open up a fitting window and haggle to death on every specific bonus gain per module you'd get based on specific theorycrafted scenarios. 
---
For the average layman eve player they often will just proxy / piggy back these folks belief systems around fits and why's.
---
Taking a titan onto a grid is not a common thing you do "every day", its like the first day you get a carrier. You save ISK to get to that point, you undock and think you have a handle on the mechanics but its not until you get into your first fight you realise there was certain things the attributes window doesn't give you... which is how do i respond to my enemy, what is my response based on ship type and so on. Given the injector infusion in game, you'd think majority of titan pilots have had to slog their way through the upgrade pathways of knowing for example how to undock a capital and above and the answers to the above.
---
However, capital fights aren't as constant and often folks are arc jumping their way from sub-cap to super to titan due to injectors. So there's a lot of inherit tacit knowledge transfer that gets lost in that moment, so for me example i think you need to lose a few at minimum carriers (not supers) in a few fights to appreciate the role a capital or above plays. Sub-caps in large fleets also are pretty much prescriptive "don't think, use this fit and press F1 please" ...
---
In Dead Coalition we spend a lot of time behind the scenes theorycrafting our fits, testing them on inbound enemies and often making decisions based on median ISK incomes of line members and FC comfort levels.  Once a fit has been established then comes the wave of Q&amp;A that matches the fits and thats where the tacit knowledge transfer begins. If a player misses those specific Q&amp;A sessions they have to either seek knowledge personally and hopefully they get a seasoned eve player to walk them through some of the theorycrafting behind fits...or they simply wait and see.
---
There is however no real "centralised" solution beyond that in/out of eve which absorbs that information and shares independent of alliance/coalition meta fights...  To which my point is that often in reddit based forums or alike the wave of "lol ..he should have..." free kicks emerge.
---
It's the game itself, and thats the way it is. I just roll my eyes whenever i see the word "should" like "oooh you're that guy who shows up after the fact barking snarky remarks about "should" but its very few of you who put yourself out their publicly and declare an opinion for others to share prior".
---
For every post-killmail expert i ask simple question "when was the last time you publicly shared your knowledge" ..usually the response is "its not my job" or "i'm not an expert but everyone should.." ...line after line of general sweeping / straw-man statements.
---
Fine... but i call bullshit :)
---
Moon mining would absolutely see a huge uptick. Even in the Imperium, all the moons in delve aren't used. Regardless of that, the t2 prices wouldn't go down, because the moons with all that good goo are actually bring fully mined, it's the massive number of nearly worthless moons that don't get touched.
---
True, but why take 600dps at sub 2km ranges when you can takes 900+dps at 15km+?
---
You’ve replaced a mobile cyno jammer with the tankiest subcap in the game. Instead of onlining after a couple minutes, it would be instant. 
---
This is the best trailer, I think. It's honest, it explains the game reasonably well, and it shows the scale and the options.
---
for the love of god, change the default overview
---
Also just to confirm, there were in fact pings in advance, both about the gang coming in and like half an hour before that about a dread bomb being in place. It just wasn’t noticed by the rorq or someone was a bit overconfident and got caught. Those paying attention definitely put two and two together. Which is why supers were told not to jump, a few were just... overzealous.
---
People would gank your excavs as soon as you space them. 
---
Or the lowsec gate to Stain
---
Thank you for the heads-up
---
and thats why j-space is awesome. no ''blue'' drama...
---
you shoot each other just to temp-blue up 30min after in order to gank someone else together and reset as soon as you left the chain.
---
It's a trash practice, I don't care if it was in an overly long MOTD or not.
---
&gt;or rat with fast response backup
---
And there in lies the problem, because the fast response backup is just a cyno away and the cloacky hunters want that nerfed which results in the people fighting cloacky hunters responding with the demand that cloaky camping 23.7 be nerfed. Its a hurricane of stupid, where even if both changes are made neither side benefits.
---
You said billions but I think you mean hundreds of billions. 
---
english please
---
As someone who absolutely loves battlereps in general, I am always up to see more!
---
That's what the choker is for 
---
just have it scale with sig size
---
Considering how long a VNI takes to make the equivalent of a VNI in isk, this seems like a very dumb argument. The last thing we need to do is make Rorqal mining and super ratting safer under the guise of protecting innocent VNIs that can make their ship back in an hour if lost...
---
yes, in the same way that people don’t get angry to ccp that players can be docked in stations. Are you 100% safe? Yes. Does that mean the mechanic is broken or should be fixed? No.
---
Imagine being so salty at someone you need to mention him in every thread.
---
I used to fly with this guy. Complete and utter retard. Nice enough though. 
---
I don't blame them with the amount of CCP bashing and reeeeeeeeeeing that goes on 😉
---
But it is the Casino War...
---
After the last war Im pretty sure you can say the same thing about the entirety of the North... They needed the reprieve that GOTG bought them....
---
tl;dr
---
They *had*
---
Don't let the haters tell you the music isn't great. 
---
Doesnt take much skill to get a rorqual or super carrier and make billions of isk quickly... buy yourself a titan which is an f1 ship when they are used en masse.... Its not cheating no matter who is doing it... but it has changed the dynamic of the game... 
---
No need for a Paladin in highsen, T2 fit pulse Apoccan do everything you want. Dual LSE pulse Oracle too, if you learn how to kite. :-)
---
It's totally understandable that Vily got confused, after all, most of the people who are set "neutral" standing to TAPI are actually their blues, so he probably assumed it applied to all neutrals.
---
Where
---
We've asked multiple times for this. 
---
Before shield supers were cool
---
That's hot
---
DELETE THIS
---
"... its like the first day you get a carrier." .... Exactly bro, that's what I'm saying! Transferable skills and experiences. You'd think someone would move forward and at least *think* before acting in an asset worth so much. That's all ive been saying this entire time!

Red Alliance once had a rather large armor super fleet.

AAA/REDOverlord/Stain Empire had a large armor super fleet they used to fight other capital fleets at the height of their empire in the south (from delve to drone space sort of thing).

Legion of xdeathx also had a large armor super fleet patrolling in drone space years ago.

Soviet-Union/Darkness Of Dispair/The Afterlife had a large shield super fleet mainly used for contesting sov where Legacy now lives.

&gt;Do I need to have CDL to make recommendations for regulations of how 18 wheelers shouldn't drive on the side walk ...?
---
That's one of the dumbest comparisons this thread has seen in the last few years. People always bitch about how caps are unbalanced and OP, until they actually get in one, get in a fight with subs and suddenly find out its not nearly as easy as they thought it was. For example, [https://br.inyour.space/?s=4388&amp;b=8458320&amp;e=90&amp;t=qb](https://br.inyour.space/?s=4388&amp;b=8458320&amp;e=90&amp;t=qb) Blood demons pushed what they thought was the instant win button and then ate shit. 
---
The BoB BBQ is real
---
I didn't even read the responses because the OP is so wrong. 
---
I have been buying and selling characters since 2012?
---
I bought my first dread alt whilst i lived in eve university (and subsequently got dumpstered by rote kapelle &amp; friends) but to say that xyz ship/xyz character being purchased is an injector problem is a fallacy. All injectors did was make it mainstream. 
---
Yeah you're right since you can 144 vs 30 and kill some caps not even all of them with tons of bombers, caps therefore are balanced 
---
Thought that meant they had a Blackbelt in deepthroating
---
200b? try 500
---
I agree with this 100%, although I feel the “this is eve” trailer was an exception. I think we can all agree that trailer captured the community’s excitement and perhaps a sense of intrigue.
---
The old cinematic storyline trailers really added a bit of depth and polish to an expansion and the game as a whole especially as a new player. 
---
I still get kinda pumped when I watch tyranus and incursion.
---
Speaking from experience I made 20+ Carrier sitters and 5-6 Carrier pilots using the Power of 2? promo in 2012/13. And i was a small fish.
---
All that's changed is the method. Touch-pay instead of Eftpos.
---
And i can confirm that I logged in every other day to update those puppies. Not a fire and forget isk making method at all.  
---
the thing is, there's not actually blue drama here.
---
How were they able to offset the camera view of the ship inside the station while looking at the fitting window (2:04). I've always had the camera center focus point locked to the center of the ship. Or is this just something CCP can do in a video to show off their game. 
---
this was before the campaign so doesnt count
---
 [https://zkillboard.com/related/30001162/201806220700/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001162/201806220700/) Ok how about 1 dread and 30 odd cruisers v 3 dreads and a titan trading 2 for 1?   
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/74858350/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74858350/) Or a handful of bombers and some t3's for flavor?
---
  
---
Just because people have the opinion that caps are unbalanced does not mean they are. Tactics are required when hunting big game, yoloing in a kitchen sink fleet and expecting to win and complaining the game is broken when you don't is just stupid.
---
10 PAP treats for you.
---
Loot fairy had to pay out some time.
---
I was doing incursions hence the paladin train, but now I'm back to LS FW so just getting all races sub caps and weapons to V (already have Amarr and most weapons V)
---
So, what your saying is, your ready to bloom?
---
I’ll see myself out
---
Very nice work
---
Sure the exciting moment of gameplay can be super intense. But to be perfectly honest the hour to hour gameplay where your looking for a fight or just krabbing or whatever it is you do in between those moments can be intensely dull.
---
I ran it past a couple friends as well. “Not Compelling” is what I got. I think the best use for this trailer is after you’ve talked someone into playing eve already. Like it would make sense to ha e them watch this once they login and ask you “What now?” 
---
As a recruiting tool I agree it’s missing something. I show friends ‘This is Eve’ all the time and the reaction is always: hey, that looks like fun. I’ll have to test this one out on some people and see the reaction
---
From what I've heard "the russians" were super-ratting on a large scale long before everyone else did.
---
That means many of their supers weren't actually ever used in combat and weren't deploying to strategic stagings.
---
sounds fun.  im in.

I have to wonder how much cheaper RMT is compared to buying from store, like 70% cheaper or 25%? It must be fairly high to warrant the potential ban (even if the chance is small for smart RMTers).
---
thats why the '' are there. im aware its not really blue drama, i just called it that way.
---
its just so much better to shoot whoever you like without having to think that you might piss someone off. and still be able to team up with exactly those you just dunked a few mins later.
---
still entertaining to read on reddid about dramas like this though..
---
"Come play our game... just 3 years of not playing to spec into capitals, or actually play with subcap but never quite get into capitals"
---
Another point to be made is the limits injectors puts on CCP balancing acts...
---
Let's say tomorrow CCP decide the Archon needs a buff (please!), but as everything with CCP they over do it and the Archon becomes the new OP ship that everyone wants to fly.
---
CCP out do themselves and notice it within a month, and decide to nerf the hell out of the now-op-archon.
---
But, during that month, 1000's of players spent $$$ to inject into that now-not-that-op-archon... what do you think reddit will look like after that?
---
Players will rage at CCP blaming them of "stealing their money", and they will be partially right actually.
---
I don't remember who said it, maybe Mukk, but the injectors makes CCP balancing mistakes much worst, as the outcome can be seen almost immediately, and can hardly be reverted.

Will this be like an npsi?

Bless you, you ornery apostle of Kesha.

jesus lmao welcome to eve?
---
It's what makes the game rewarding and gives depth. Everything is intertwined and it's a micro-society that you're part of. You might think your plan works, but whoever you're going against might have a counter-plan, etc. The level of strategy due to the game's player driven nature always amazes me.
---
I'm an Eve player and I had to skip through the trailer.  Yawn.  Need another "This is Eve" type trailer.
---
14 years later still get new experiences ;p
---
I mean this is kinda the meme isn't it.  Just because TEST has always talked about how great they are at honoring agreements doesn't mean everyone else is.  Literally coordinating with snuff in 2019.  It was silly enough of BL to try to work with them, yet smoothebrains continue to be surprised when they get shit on....
---
I had a pretty big stockpile. At one point I found someone unloading a bunch for cheap and figured it's something that is always needed and bought all of it. It was something like something like 5000 units when I bought it and I'm down to around 1600.
---
jesus christ vily we're NEUTRAL
---
HELLO
---
They had, but they didnt expand when everyone else did, so that large fleet became relatively small vs others
---
Sometimes you just gotta autopilot an untanked, cargo-expanded DST with a 12-digit cargo just to flex on high-sec miners 😤😤
---
living
---
They dropped a wyvern fleet in B-R
---
They'd have to have a ridiculous payout, purely because it's more cost-effective to sit in the same system and grind 60 low payout rats than travel 40 systems for one mission, not to mention to risk of travel.
---
yes we are. But we have been nuetral since TEST lived in vale. There are different degrees of nuetral, there are degrees of hostile neutral and there are degrees of "let me give you 100bil for those dreads neutral", In the end, its done. A titan doesn't worry me at all. Its just a titan. The relationships cultivated at the high end usually carry so much more weight.
---
Whats interesting is the test ones have 20% more ehp vs ferox than the horde/nc ones due to the resists 
---
Even when you're below -5, there's really no issue getting a new frig / destroyer sized ship in a station in high sec and just immediately jumping back into low. I do it all the time from Myyhera. Wouldn't do it in something really slow however.
---
Good to hear there are good people out there. Glad you turned your life around. Dont miss your real life for the game though (but im sure you have figured that out by now.)
---
&gt;I have never seen anyone trying to make up something so wrong as you are.
---
And I've never seen anyone think they have the authority to override a clear cut statement from a game dev and dictate to the company what is bannable and what is not, even after the company goes to the extra trouble of having a dev spell out in simple language that broadcasting to control your characters or communicate in game is in fact a bannable offense.
---
Real question... cargo expanders on a DST?
---
you owe us another 100b for your cryposting
---
During EUTZ, there are russians (Smile and Wave) that are often camping the Otelen gate in Huola. Usually at least an Ashimmu and a logi.
---
LOL Top comment right here. Good stuff
---
im saying that its ridiculous to say that capitals are not broken just cus he managed to kill them with 5:1 numbers 
---
how did you not catch that lmao?
---
&gt; nobody that i have ever asked, in over a decade has ever lied to me like this. 
---
How many of the people that you've asked have been actively hunting your super move ops? It's a tough situation but what do you want people to say there?
---
\- Yes we're actively hunting you, meaning you maybe don't move wasting many man hours
---
\- No we're not coming for you, straight up lying to your face and burning the bridge harder
---
\- Skirt around the edges and give no official yes or no
---
Whilst you might have good relations with snuff, those have only appeared to be in the larger scale operations. 
---
It's coming across that you're taking this a lot harder than perhaps you should, hunting supers and dropping move ops is snuffs bread and butter and as long as you're not official blues with them I imagine they'd attempt it again given the chance.
---
Lulz!!
---
(non-fatally)
---
Why would someone transport skins, if its not rmt? Cause you can activate skins from where ever you are...
---
Wait some legacy pet requires to pay for lossmails? Why not just join brave or test, they dont care for your kb and youd still be in same coalition
---
Meh Poe is a good game, but it don’t have the longevity. I have never played through a full league before getting bored and taking a league or 2 break
---
Wait, there was a whole empire in stain? How long ago was this? 
---
Awesome that they used so much actual in game footage. Maybe could have used a bit more work on the script as some parts were a bit wobbly sounding. But the best eve trailer for new people i have seen so far.
---
It's a huge group.  As a result we try really hard to build tons of small groups that people can Get involved with.  So they have a chance to find their place.
---
It's from a goon fleet; the guy's name is Penisfarts
---
i cried
---
INCONCEIVABLE!
---
... You could have just gotten like 2 amarr epic arc shares while under the booster and went from -10 to like +4.
---
My only problem is it’s pretty boring, especially at the start. Who is seriously going to sit through this whole thing?
---
Same. Luckily this league is chock full of shit to do. The pure breachstones have made leveling nearly trivial though if you have currency.

Not even the first time this has happened.

Unfortunately, that's why new player retention is so low.

"different degrees of neutral" jesus christ vily have I got a spot on PL's diplo team for you
---
Thanks
---
Savage
---
Who spotted the highsec rorq?
---
It's possible they simply used two monitors or an ultrawide aspect ratio and cropped one side out. 
---
Very true, I guess the point I am making is why did they go through that work to make that scene look cool when they don't provide it by default in the game. Like they obviously think it is a cool look, why advertise it and not add it in game. 
---
In a similar vein, theres a few guys from HK who have really supported me into drastically improving my life over the last year. This game is crazy in the relationships you can form

I feel like that's an amazing thing for me to try and be apart of.

this trailer is dogshit
---
Its pretty much priceless....
---
And that’s when I’d quit lol
---
My advice, join a newb oriented null alliance.  I picked brave this time around and I’m really digging it. They’ve carved out a really nice little theme park in null. There’s explo and mining and wormholes etc.  I’ve been kicking around brave space for weeks and I still haven’t been in every system. 
---
But the real joy is Catch. It’s like, a PVPers paradise. Waves of neutrals just endlessly crash against GE.  You don’t hafta live there but if you do, you will learn why Eve is Eve. 
---
Also the pve money is nuts in null. Explo sites just about quadruple in value (and are easily runnable as an alpha), ores are worth more. A venture miner can easily make enough to keep themselves in tackle Atrons, or T 1 logi, or Ewar. And that’s months of experimenting right there.
---
You can find friends like this anywhere, you just have to join a group and put yourself out there and meet the other pilots.
---
For me it was like "Oh no Oh no oooooooh noooooo hahahaa" in the end!

You call it clear skies but those wingy bits arnt square

---
This was at the height of the Southern Coalition, in late 2011 to mid-2012, right before the HBC War/Delve War 2012. Stain Empire was less of an empire in Stain, but the alliance that had that name was a particularly ferocious group of Russians who had a small patch of sov in the Esoteria entrance to Stain and mostly kept to themselves. They were nominal friends with AAA and ROL. However, since about 2014 or so, they've been increasingly inactive. Its only 1 or 2 guys left afaik
---
There’s a new logi ship now 
---
Yeah i think we were just talking paste each other lol... for me its the skip from carrier to titan is probably the root cause of a lot of issues... not just titans but rorqs, or pretty much any ship.. the game was originally designed with progression tree's in mind but once skill injectors were introduced its been a chase the the tail strategy since.
---
I have no doubt you could sit here all day curating the URL's but the issue is how you specifically scale across all of eve without some Reddit REEEE screeching / downvote reaction. 
---
TBH i think there are less and less people willing to do what you just did in game either due to fatigue and/or interest in game winding down... 
---
It really should revert back to CCP and their design team to think of new ways to repair the damage of skill injectors and their butterfly effects... through to looking at ways to stimulate learning to fly better for top tier ships (for when you're not around to dump out your bookmarks of choice).
---
So they should knock the fuck off the police skins as the answer to all problems and just get back to basics... mid-end tier gamers are looking for more and more advice / strategy / theorycrafting ... but are lost in a hazey world of broken google searches filled with hit-n-miss mechanic solutions.
---
THis btw doesn't excuse the tittan loss in the thread.. he knew well before anyone opened their mouths where he should and shouldn't have gone... it was just a bad day and muscle memory didn't kick in at certain points. That being said, he took it in great spirits and already had the titan replaced ..so expensive day but game goes on right.

Imagine there was a time when a super fleet was 3-4 directors in motherships.

So. Uh. Yall must've been drunk or something, but that english is as broken as CO2. 
---
the thing that blows my mind about this is how little effort it actually would take.
---
I understand that the code is insane, so for game mechanics there's often no "easy fix," but this is completely different.  It's trivial to make a cleaner, more usable overview in like 15 minutes.  Why wouldn't they just knock it out in an afternoon?
---
It does read in input from the game and interpret it, which should classify it as not being allowed, right?
---
That reminds me, what ever happened to StainWagon?
---
The miner scrimps and saves and grinds, makes spreadsheets and profit calculations, multiplies his wealth for years and hoards it like Smaug. Then one fateful day he packs his fortunes into an anti-tanked hauler and enters a high-stakes elite PvP match. He loses everything, of course. Why? Because he just assumed that highsec was a safe space. Should have had a permit!
---
A trailer is meant to attract the audience the product is intended for. 
---
Dont worry guys Cargo Scanners don’t work in High Sec
---
&gt; Mercenary Marketplace
---
what?
---
Yeah, but putting the ship off center could produce terrible forces tearing it apart when you start spinning it. CCP simply can't risk that.  
---
She's working overtime today
---
Obviously retarded
---
Who right clicks the module to overheat it? 
---
just what
---
This. This has been confusing the hell out of me for a while now.
---
They have three timers that take over a week to kill. If you cannot be ready to kill a hostile fleet with 10 days notice at a very specific time maybe just maybe you don't deserve to do it.
---
Putting Snuff aside, are you saying that all PL did in the last war was whore on a molok? 
---
They literally started it because Legacy was so scared of PL’s superfleet that they had to call in goons, which is really what changed the war from a series of smaller conflicts to a war that involved nearly every nullsec alliance. 
---
They were the first to cyno in supercaps at UALX-3, and they made up a fair bit of the northern supers/titans at the x47 hull timer, although that did go poorly. 
---
The hell is that fit???
---
Also. Pilot! If you quit over this shit. Can I have what little of your shit is left??
---
No need to change your mind, you're functionally brain dead.
---
I got bored 60s in. The monotone narration ruined whatever message they were trying to get across.
---
Nah, it really is capitals and n+1. Titans and Super have always been a bit of a problem as eventually most players would have them, then rorquals appeared and the cat that was already out of the bag but growing slowly turned into a 2000lbs tiger over night and CCP have literally no clue on how to stop it. They never did. All the time there's no attempt to kill n+1 in any way, shape or form then nothing will change.
---
This, its also under 2 bil
---
ya just outnumber them 6:1 lul
---
maybe
---
not sure what this means
---
details will be released saturday 
---
whynot?
---
huh?
---
me
---
&gt;Also, the cloaky camper can't cyno a super/titan on you due to the same limitations put in place by a cyno. They can probably only BLOPs ....
---
Oh yes they can. The only time you cannot cyno onto a target is when they are in deadspace, but then you can't covert cyno into deadspace either.
---
Hunters almost always fit both covert and regular cynos to their ships. It doesn't matter whether it's a stealth bomber or a T3C. ie:
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/74891853/
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/74890816/
---
&gt;If they're cloaked and AFK, then they are not a threat. Something can't tackle you if they're AFK right?
---
I know you aren't a cloaky hunter Stitch. I love your videos. But I want to understand this line of thinking. I am asking the cloaky hunters here:
---
Why do you say "If they're cloaked and AFK, then they are not a threat", rather than "If they're cloaked and AFK, then they are not a target"?
---
I've heard so many hunters complain that they cannot get most targets because they either cloak up or dock up when hunters are a few jumps out. You can't really force targets to engage you if they are docked, granted.
---
But why don't you want the ability to kill a blingy cloaked Rattlesnake that's trapped in your system? You know he's there, you've been waiting to catch him, but you couldn't probe him down in time. But he can't go anywhere without decloaking.
---
I guess he just isn't a target anymore. He is AFK cloaked and you have to just ignore him, and surely that just grinds the gears of hunters. Right? Don't you want a way to force an engagement, without needing to wait 7 hours to try again?
---
I'm in that place you started right now... thanks for reminding me that there is still light ahead. 
---
Also just did another edit that fixed one of the Formulas that I forgot to change a reference for on that other fix :P

The reps are real... I love this. I'm a vet who's been having a rough go at it for some years now. I've been able to use Eve to meet other vets, and really have some one to talk to. It has really started to get my ass out "structure." 
---
Coming from Marine to civilian life is like switching from armor doctrine to shield lol. Yo I did not have the reps I needed getting out. I was really close to losing and giving up. My Corp has been a life saver with solid Logi both in and out of game. I feel like such an utter nerd typing this. But I think it really fits. Yo, the Reps are real
---
I don't think I can Yolo My Super/Titan around in a WH though :P
---
Can keep it in low for fleet support drops! 
---
the xdeath supers that died last summer weren't the famed russian shield super fleet, they were just krab supers
---
op's talking about the soviet-union wyvern fleet, and i think most of those ships ended up in tri
---
It isn't. As a whole, trying to learn everything at once, its fucking impossible. 
---
If you break it up, and learn the mechanics piece by piece, it becomes so much easier
---
They were Russian... lol
---
I miss the original warp noise. :(
---
i wish [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMLnUjNlRL0&amp;t=390s)  could be real eve player
---
Skill point loss for super loss instead of t3s, will never happen though. 
---
holy shit you're actually stupid 
---
now this post my friend, i fully agree with.
---
there was a post on reddit today with the MS paint triangle and the eye cancer colour choices.... that guys post is top.
---
Stupidest idea ever lmao delete yourself
---
[jfc don't remove asset safety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9mct2i/so_as_a_higher_incentive_to_keep_citadels_fuelled/e7dt9ln/)
---
Local is also iffy - if you take it out it makes it harder to bot I guess, but also gives you a huge incentive to turtle up under a super umbrella (because you can either prevent yourself from being tackled or you can get backup once you get tackled, and if you can't do one you wanna focus on the other). So we'd see a lot more standing fleet + cap drop counterplay, &amp; even more incentive to ship into a main powerbloc rather than operate as an independent entity. (Abyssal sites might alleviate this, though, as would more nullsec missions.) 
---
I kinda liked the constellation local idea someone floated a while back, but there's probably issues with it I haven't figured out yet. 
---
inb4 nova confirmed reworked into wis 2.0
---
oh fuckin ransome... i just txted him to ask wtf...     :(( sad day
---
Gonna answer this in good faith - if cyno takes e.g. 30s for a cap to lock to jump to, that cloaky camper no longer represents an instantly deliverable and so potentially uncounterable threat. It is arguably more affected by the delay than the response fleet, as much of the survivability relies on getting in and out fast before defending side can respond.
---
Also you are slightly neglecting that many of the targets dropped onto are mostly afk themselves (rorq gameplay not being the most compelling)
---
Functionally deceased, the alliances that made it up have mostly been absorbed by Goons or live as Stain residents these days.
---
&gt;There was alot of built up trust.
---
lol, if you ever believed Snuff and the gang you are a fool
---
This is a good video for once you’ve already convinced someone to play and show them the basic mechanics and then they say: Now What? It’s a good video to describe that there are infinite options and shows some of the things you could do. And maybe they could resonate with something shown and then you teach them that or push them in that direction. Otherwise the non players I’ve tested it on all said it wasn’t compelling to them
---
Imagine this guy's face when the ganking started.

Can i bring a cyno ?

Except it isn't, the purpose of a trailer is to attract *an* audience.
---
"Since the purpose of the trailer is to attract an audience to the film, these excerpts are usually drawn from the most exciting, funny, or otherwise noteworthy parts of the film but in abbreviated form"
---
Replace film with game, etc.
---
Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the watch and love eve, but imagine it from the perspective of a new player.
---
Compare it to this is eve, dominion, butterfly effect.
---
The bomber scene, "yeahhhhh Haha yeahhhhh"
---
Suddenly Russians in dominion nuking everything
---
The concept of the butterfly effect.
---
That's the kind of shit for new players and subsequently why I signed up.
---
There are loot pinatas, and then there are *hundreds of billions of isk* loot pinatas.
---
The choice of ship and the fit are even more admiration worthy.
---
Considering how bastardized it was from the original concept and the mental clusterfuck that almost ruined it, I'm still amazed it turned out as well as it did.  The original concept was pretty epic, but after "marketing" got a hold of that trailer was almost a complete shit show and was literally saved by a few people at the last minute.

Nope, just your average batting apoc 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
No it was writen in a rage mail to everyone 
---
This is like the Silmarillion of kill mails.
---
alphas.
---
remember before mining barges there were mining battleships? this is what happens when you ban people from barges but not battleships.
---
oh and, obligatory 'bots'.
---
yeh i should be there, bit of a rough tz for me but hopefully i can make it. surprises me a lot how many people knew him too, definitely had a great reputation in the older wh community for being a kind guy.
---
Got a pyfa warrior over here :P
---
hah, I remember those days... Makes sense
---
Go out and gank a vent. Show support for James 315 and the Code in your bio. Apply to NOL and you are in. It isn’t much harder than that.
---
Anyone interested in ganking? Join us so we together can save HiSec!
---
Our tactics and what motivates us can be found on Minerbumping.com and zkillboard.com. We are the most transparent alliance in Eve. 
---
Except for our secret schedules, of course. They are very secret.
---
Have you seen the latest blog about me? It was soooo good! If you do well you can also be featured on the blog. We even have a special medal for that.
---
See you in fleet soon!
---
It was writen in one of the 100 mails they sent you with their shit every day under alliance mail but this one was in rage and with many capital letters and !!!!!! 
---
I had no loyalty to evictus anyway i feld like a number   i kinda liked my corp but it seems like everyone just was ok with it to be extorted by some dickhead they never met or talked to  
---
So i just went on discord and expressed my concerns  because they litterly said in the mail of you don't pay we Will kick you and make your life misserble.   And what did those arogant leadership dicks say to me ?  That i should shut up    
---
Yeah constellation local is a great idea. What’s dumber than docking up when you see some neuts enter local? Docking up when they are 5 jumps away. 
---
Missions? What are you on about?
---
In regards to asset safety, We should definitely balance the game around people who stop playing for awhile or can only play 2hrs a week or something. Wouldn’t want people to lose their ships and items they are so sentimentally attached to, in tyool 2019 where isk is hard to come by. Ffs
---
What is this 2007 
---
rude!
---
Snuff kills a bluetral Titan. No way man that would never happ.... oh it has before a few times. Test just been fucking reyard Dino's as normal.
---
There’s a special place in hell for almost anyone ! But to be honest, I fit cargo scanners on my
---
Cheetah because I don’t really have the use of that midslot after prop mod and scanning upgrades. I just use it to see where the good cans are, and keep them for last :3
---
&gt;words
---
yep, reading correctly would have helped;) Your idea is better, make ratting more active (also mining, but that seems hard to do) and lower the amount or rats that can be killed... somehow. if it's through respawn time, or through depletion over time doesn't really matter in my opinion
---
And now look where he is and where you are, mister xdeath military high command.
---
It's the only way. I always have to cover the neocom to find the damn fitting window lol
---
well, the leshak was a move into the right direction, but with the current application of caps against battleships, leshaks would just melt.
---
It would have to be something, that can diminish incoming damage from fighters and cap guns while being very good on the offensive. On the other hand, they could be extremely thin skinned, and with low tracking, bad against subs.
---
Rattlesnake (or the cheap option is a domi) but have an MJD
---
The web towers in the last room are just a killer so the only way to really deal with them is to just MJD away.
---
No, there used to be what was at the time an enormous wyvern fleet floating around the south east. But due to super cap proliferation and people moving alliances as others have alluded to, it's not really a thing anymore.
---
Please stop ruining progods agenda with your kills. Just roll over and die like the dinos.
---
Not a sad day at all! The gankers are happy, and the pilot has learned a valuable lesson about mortality. Plus if someone’s transporting 500B+ in an untanked DST they probably have enough “fuck you” isk to just /shrug. 
---
The only reason you’d ever do this is: 
---
1) RMT
---
2) Get popular on Zkill/reddit 
---
yes it changed gameplay. And now? The only thing that changed, like you said, is that you do not know what the skills of a player can be at max if you look at the character. This was unfair like hell already, an older player saw immediately: "Well this noob poses no danger to my T3". 
---
And all you complain is, that a cyno alt now can be 1hr old instead of 4days? cmon, that is the biggest whining ever...
---
*narration*: ...prosperity...
---
*video*: mining venture
---
Still nice video though.
---
Dude. That’s not billions, the blueprints alone are pushing 500B 
---
In our defence - it was a decent fight.
---
That's actually a nice story. Who said again that EVE community is the toxic waste of internet? :)  
---
I wish you good luck, happiness and more success in your future. Spod bless.
---
&gt; if cyno takes e.g. 30s for a cap to lock to jump to, that cloaky camper no longer represents an instantly deliverable and so potentially uncounterable threat
---
I would argue that carriers and supers share the same "time to engage" as a black-ops battleship: Jump time, lock time, shoot time (I haven't done the maths though)
---
The NSA is "the module", it changes the game completely for carriers and supercarriers. Even dreads and titans cry that they don't get anything nearly as useful as a NSA.
---
It's to the point that I can say truthfully that I wouldn't mind if they made NSA into a low-slot only module. Even if you had to give up tank or damage lowslots, it is still be 100% worth it.
---
The major difference is that blackops can use covert cynos, which is indeed a really massive benefit.
---
In the wizard...
---
Fit?
---
Haven't pressed f1 enough for opinion REEEEEEE
---
Do you not know what punctuation and sentence coherence is?
---
Well, glad to hear it ) 
---
As a dd-like weapon system it is of course not allowed in high...:-)
---
Wait that's how I fit my rag Jay. Please no booley.
---
I'm really happy to hear that, I have the same thing with my dudes and I don't know where i'd be without them. 
---
then they join test
---
OP: if you change cyno mechanics so there is a jump delay, you need to address cloaky camping
---
stitch k (guy your initial reply was to): the change to cyno mechanics impacts cloaky campers too, so it would lower power of cloaky camping, as it is predicated on speed preventing response.
---
Your first reply: but cloaky campers can fit cynos (you missed his point) then some stuff about reframing (fwiw, if a dude has got safe and you can’t find him, from hunting side you move on, nbd)
---
My reply to you: attempting to clarify and expand on stitch k’s point about how adding a delay into the cyno-&gt;jump-&gt;shoot loop also drops cloaky camper power.
---
Your second reply: still missing the original point? To reiterate, the delay discussed is not a ‘current end to end delay’ it’s an ADDED delay on top of that. 
---
This is not to say that I disagree with NSA being too strong, I think it should have bastion like mechanic forcing some level of stationary commitment at minimum.
---
Are we on the same page now?
---
&gt;frag 300 feroxes without either side worrying about getting danked on by supers
---
actually looks pretty damn good, best start content available in eve rn?
---
???
---
Overheat cargo expanders
---
Don't need em. We got to salvage 300+ wrecks of feroxes for an average recovery rate of 150 feroxes worth of kit. Rigs are a bit expensive now though.
---
The video depicts the game rather well: boring as fuck.
---
A film needs you to watch it once.  Eve doesn't need temporary subs, there's already a trial.  They would be best served catering to the player that is ready to play for years.  I think that warrants a different type of trailer.  I bet they see random fleet fight battles in eve before seeing something like an official trailer.
---
I originally got interested in eve from some story about burn jita.  I thought the concept was awesome that this sandbox had that level of latitude.
---
Fuck goons though 
---
I am both scared and aroused.
---
Honestly, I am not on topic and I will admit that. I am more just chatting in general. Ok?
---
&gt; (fwiw, if a dude has got safe and you can’t find him, from hunting side you move on, nbd)
---
I don't understand why people accept this. It works against hunters and anti-hunters. It just stops content, full stop. But eh, w/e
---
&gt;stitch k’s point about how adding a delay into the cyno-&gt;jump-&gt;shoot loop also drops cloaky camper power.
---
Neither OP or Stitch are even talking about cyno jump delays. You might be responding to two different topics or something. The topic is about cyno nerfs in general. (Which I am not talking about)
---
You sound like you got an irish accent
---
he doesnt.
---
7o
---
Was this a piñata for someone's birthday?
---
Monocle pops out...
---
what alliance are you in? been wanting to get into WHs
---
I have like 8b of it right now which accounts for like 2% of my total net worth lol 
---
why dont you new beans make more content like Clear Skies?... you kids suck, i hate you
---
John Smedly...Like the guy that killed Star Wars Galaxies? Was at the helm when they drove that wonderful game into the ground? That guy is giving ccp advice?!
---
Oof. 
---
If I can suggest,
---
Cruise launchers up top, use a drone link augmenter in the utility slot. 
---
XL shield booster with X-type boost amp. Adaptives, with that MJD mentioned. 
---
Cant remember the number lows, but 3 DDAs, 2 Ballistic controls. 
---
Use rigs to increase boost amount, and decrease time to boost.  
---
Sorry, not in front of my PC or I'd send an actual fit. 
---
This fit.
---
This fit makes me want to *drink.*
---
This fit has *surpassed* anything I have ever seen in dst stupidity. I have seen fully cargo expanded bustards on zkill before. That's not a joke. Some people do that.
---
This fit has everything wrong with it I can imagine *yet there's still more* - it has a T2 cloak and has an mwd, so they were probably thinking of doing cloak+mwd.
---
... Except it's an undersized one.
---
Wow.
---
Actually, its not that big. You pay ~10m and you get ~35m, so its 25m back. A T2 fitted one is 70-80m. But still, that's 50m for a very effective BC dps.
---
I would argue that Capital Defense is too strong, AND sub-capital offense is too strong.  These two work to balance eachother out in a situation like Goons in Delve, but the balance eats shit in places with less organization.
---
I am mildly amused and confused by the lack of eyes on the sub-cap power creep.  Some people have been looking at the MJD Raven stuff, and we had the Interceptor Nullification change,  but there are other ships too.  (Eg 60bn killed by 3 bombers with 1 attack).
---
Hmmmmm. One problem I've noticed, just briefly, is that your daily-mined-value doesn't really account for days where no mining gets done, but from experience I know that's kind of a pain to do.
---
OP starts by pointing out that if cyno mechanics are changed (to delay or diminish a capital response, one of the prevailing suggestions), as well as also mentioning rorq/injector chat, then cloaky camping needs to be looked at too. Stitch is replying directly to that point by saying that a nerf to one can also be a nerf to the other. I initially responding to what seemed a misguided response, and here we are no better off. Maybe I’m the misguided one...
---
It’s far more palatable for a player to use defensive means to prevent their own destruction than it is for a player to use (yes yes high investment/organisation/who really gives a shit it’s bad gameplay design synergy) a total of approximately 5 button presses across 2 characters (or generously two players) to wipe out potentially hundreds. That kind of power fantasy is fine in a single player game, but it doesn’t work as good multiplayer design.
---
The problem in reality is that a series of individually acceptable, ill-considered in sum mechanics and game features mean that ccp have to absolutely clobber titans and supercarriers (given their monetisation strategy has made them far more prolific than their balance point allows) to fix game balance. This will never happen properly because of how many people have seen them as a solution either to the age old problem of pve being mind numbing and time consuming or to the individual impotence of being a big bloc member. 
---
Addressing presently simple binary/instant mechanics to restore some semblance to the power/projection curve is the only other realistic way to fix the game. You might need to do a second pass to address the psychology of cloaky camping, but the time/effort/return point for catching someone out doesn’t have to change that much for it to just not be worth the trouble.
---
Those are some of my slightly more off-topic thoughts on the matter :)
---
I mean I'm Irish so yes I have an Irish accent. 
---
Wait... a working chat client?
---
I have a healthy relationship with my wife and I am not confused about my sexual identity, do I need to whip up a dominatrix or can I role-play as a dude?  There won't be any sort of weird initiation ceremony where I have to wear a bra on my head?
---
Step 4: Introduce T2 Rorquals
---
For a moment White Noise. had something going as well, until their leaders were all permabanned for RMT.
---
when i started playing eve, i saw this trailer and it just left me confused. when you have no idea what cynos are and how stargates work, or what dimensions what ship have, you just hear a bunch of guys larping it out to some pixels. i think 2019 does a great job to explain to you what this sandbox can deliver and seems overall more honest
---
Over 4000 now
---
It was ok, its not bad. But it will never trump "This is EVE" from 2014. It has 3.8m views on youtube on official EVE channel + gamespot posting has 650k views and there are others as well.
---
I didn't know that but I don't transport stuff. Also maybe cross region trading
---
... Sure you can counter WH's by stuffing them with killfodder.
---
You can also shoot the cyno ship...
---
Oh no. 
---
Idk man, The Eve is Real, I was there vid and the This is Eve Vid really get me going.  God I fucking love those. I Will pay 100b to the man who can coax CCP to make another that holds a flame to those two.
---
Don't sweat it mate, it's fine :-)
---
And honestly, I agree completely with what you say.
---
Although I would argue that you really need to do as many balance changes at once (properly of course), because CCP is making a habit of not doing follow up changes.
---
Sorry, but I think you will have a hard time to fit in. Most, if not all, are very confused about most things about people and relations. The rest just roleplay that they are. We are basement dwellers that never see the sun (except ingame).
---
Since we worship James we actually don’t call it dominatrix (because we don’t support that ship), we call it Catalytrix. We roleplay that we are sexually attracted to anything starting with the word Cat. 
---
Our initiation rituals are secret after a few members got banned a few years ago, but it includes something called the ”bonus room”. Do you have TS?
---
Just send me your full api, social security number, IP adress, pet’s middle names and shoe size and I will accept your application to join the  TCE.
---
Tbf i wouldn’t trust snuff even if I would be in their alliance .. why would I trust them if I’m not lol isn’t the first public backstab they did to kill titans 
---
I mean I setup a trap and killed a few of them. They def existed
---
Bad joke 
---
People would probably just reject and request a new one till they find one that suits them
---
This subreddit is completely amazing in upvoting posts that are stupid, untrue and written by anybody else than a Goon.
---
Without using a blanket whine coverage of 'capitals' and 'rorqual mining', your argument holds no face.
---
By following your logic, the top tier ship will always be a problem, since your entire argument is n+1 based at its core.  You see to understand this, so I don't get what your core argument is.
---
Injectors accelerate Meta shift in low-mid sp players, and accelerate alts for high sp players.  
---
Rorquals are far less of an economic issue than people think, you can observe MER mining results and historical Mineral prices to see this.  The rorqual issue is similar to the capital issue, it is a top tier n+1 ship.
---
Again this pulls the Rorqual argument into the TTK frame instead of any economic one.  If people didn't use rorquals they would use something else if the isk/h was still relevant.  If the ISK/h was not relevant, then mineral prices would rise until it was.  At that point since Isk/h/account is normalized, alts make the same there as they do now.
---
So now we have resolved Capitals and Rorquals into an n+1 TTK issue, and Injectors are merely an acceleration of this effect.  Power acceleration is not an issue, and is only one for those who want initial adopter advantage.
---
If someone is using injectors to make 30 alts, they probably would have done the same thing over time eventually.  The only sounding argument for Injectors is the PLEX sub churn rate.  This reduces the cost of non-income producing alts.
---
This aspect of injectors actually helps the PVPer who doesn't PVE.  Their alt accounts now cost less to run.
---
This is i always say TIS.             
---
While many people can say - CCP devs are not to make shows ... ill say that CCP is company selling "fun" to very specific community.           Having a regular updates that steal our time are good thing 
---
Heck yeah! Glad you found your way to a better life and happiness, fellow Capsuleer! **7o**
---
Thanks for sharing your story with us.
---
Still, shut up
---
How to join CODE.: Go out and gank a vent! Show support for James 315 and the Code in your bio. Apply to NOL.
---
See you two soon in fleet!
---
And what’s wrong with being Russian ? You dirty capitalist pig !
---
inb4 ''just bring jamms against fighters/drones''
---
Did it sound like I was saying there was something wrong with it? Did you just ASSUME my bias???
---
Hey Jin,
---
From a viewer's perspective, the analyst desk did a good job of making the stream engaging between battles. However, it was often unclear when the next match would start. Having exact times is probably hard due to the volatility of match length and team logistics, but it would be nice to have a suggested next match time, like the AT has.
---
It was nice to have screens showing what comps each team would be bringing before each match, and I think more things like that could be added. One thing could be a screen that shows the five comps that each team has, which ones they've already fielded (and can't use), and which one the other team chooses to ban, which can then transition to the existing chosen comps screen. I think this would give viewers a better perspective of that aspect of the tournament ruleset, as well as give the analysts an easier opportunity to tell viewers why they think a certain comp was banned, since the remaining comps will be visible.
---
Another screen that would be nice is a piece of data visualization that I don't know has been done before in a live EVE tournament: A graph that shows the applied DPS, maximum potential DPS, and non-ECM'd/hazed maximum potential DPS of a team over the course of a match, alongside a timeline of downed ships. In Round C, [Loser of B] was getting ECM'd by a Blackbird, and chose to primary [Loser of A]'s Brutix instead of their Hyperion. I wonder if they could've burned the Hyperion down if they primaried it first. It's a question that the hypothetical chart mentioned above could probably do a good job answering by showing the [Loser of B]'s DPS chart alongside a line showing the Hyperion's repping potential. [I made a crummy paint drawing of what it could look like](https://i.imgur.com/KTGUDzV.png). While the spectator overlay already pulls overall team DPS and maximum DPS, this would probably require some dev time from CCP's dataviz people to collect, so it's a pie in the sky for me.
---
Other than that, the tournament overlay wasn't showing any EWAR outside of scrams, and it'd be nice if that could get fixed. Would also be nice to be able to see whether affected jams are successful rather than the viewer and the caster having to take a guess, how other forms of EWAR are scripted, and the source of a particular tackle/EWAR. Again though, more in the purview of CCP.
---
Regarding the format, I think a simple two-hour, one-day tournament made things simple and straightforward for everyone involved. Single elimination bracket w/ 3rd place match seemed good, although a double elimination bracket might also be nice. With potentially 8 teams for the next one, maybe having two 4-team double elimination qualifier brackets (a.k.a. GSL brackets) for a second day 4-team double elimination match, and teams can bring a 5 completely different comps on the second day? Makes things more complicated, but would keep the five-comps system intact.
---
Lastly, I feel that EVE tournaments in general have a lot of downtime between rounds, and I feel like the broadcasters could do some special (or goofy) stuff in between to shake things up. Maybe some pyfa warrioring over potentially good comps under this tourny's rules, or a Delve boson speedrun, or Abyssal Herons. The last two ideas are probably horrible, but I think something aside from the tournament to break up the downtime would be good.
---
Thanks for organizing this, Jin!
---
&gt;explain what it is then.
---
haws
---
yeah it's a solid counter if you have 73 mid slots
---
People tend to forget that CCP make tons of money from people injecting those 20-30milion to get into a capital.                
---
This is like 1 year sub in one strike ... and lets be honest in many cases we are talking about 2 years as big part of the injectors are coming from skill farms that are running.    
---
For me the only reasonable solution now is to adjust space - make areas where players cannot use big toys due to blocking mechanics.              
---
Rorquals also need to be adjusted but in not a way people think or want.           
---
CCP wallets desire this cash but at the same time players desire to kill those ships.          
---
Both sides have valid demands.              
---
Rorqual need to be cheaper - like T1 excavators need to be a thing ... but at cost of PANIC module, that simply need to go.           
---
Rorquals will die more often - people will be happy ... rorquals will be still desired and injected so CCP will be happy. 
---
Please don't?
---
did you know tracking disruptors also work against fighters?
---
What is a target locker?
---
oh that's solid, so when you use a tracking disruptor on one player and you don't need to use on every single one of their modules, why should I have to use one on all 5 of their drones, or all 3 of their fighters? how is this logical?
---
BREAKING: Someone wishes to kill rorquals with just one stratios
---
Yeah I think for that I would've had to have the =Unique on the Graph Calc page into something that Arrayed every date between the Start/End Dates on the front page.
---
[It's not this "bonus room" is it?](http://static.wixstatic.com/media/a3abc1_75c163fe0eaa4f1c878f2172c411b2be.jpg/v1/fill/w_784,h_337,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/a3abc1_75c163fe0eaa4f1c878f2172c411b2be.webp)  If it is, I withdraw my application
---
Ecm drones , 1 on each drone or fighter ..
---
that'd be solid if every ship had a drone bay. Is that the game we're playing right now?
---
Ehh just shoot them?
---
do drones actually count as targeting you? I know fighters do but I actually don't know the drone mechanics.
---
Dust wasnt a failure, or atleast they turned it around. Also nova is for pc
---
Gestapo is after you. Better pay up.
---
I tried but for some reason the Hel was able to 2 shot my tempest so my efforts we're not enough that day.
---
Yeah, that sounds like a pain in the ass. The other option is a column chart, but it looks pretty ugly. If Google were consistent with their chart axis options, that'd be nice, and allow for using a Combo chart to easily handle it, but nope.
---
 Space Superiority fighters  are anti-drone and anti-fighter weapons... 
---
I might be wrong but the square wingy bits are from the tempest fleet issue which I think was the model used in 3.(things might have changed not 100% sure) 
---
Back in the day they talked about raiding complexes in radar/data sites to get more loot, than what was left over from blowing up structures.
---
southern russian alliances owned a bunch of shield supers at one point, whether it ever became a fleet is still up for debate.
---
I'm simply explaining it you fucking weirdo? 
---
Thought it looked odd!
---
But what if i am a dick myself?
---
1 liek = 1 prayer for our fallen smoothbrain bros.
---
More than 2 years of thinking by now, still no action. If Theresa May gets ousted at least she'll be fully qualified to take charge of game balance at CCP.
---
Well not every ship can fit modules like tracking disruptors, missile dirsuptors or Ecm either , of eevery ship could counter every ship what’s the point having a counter part 
---
they could if they had ranges increased, but some how a capacitor reduction on one of the most expensive battleships in the game that you would never put smart bombs on is how they decided to handle that situation.
---
Oh hell yeah you'll fit right in. EVE lets you live your best space bastard life.
---
Eve is a game. 
---
But the friendships and their impacts on your life are real. I'm holding off my wedding until I can fly Gee Nyx and his family over to the states from The Netherlands to be my best man. 
---
Keep being well and getting better!
---
CCP killed module compression (many) years ago by butchering the scrap metal repro rate. Now to compress mins you just mine/buy compressed raw ore and ship that. 
---
every ship could have that, what drone based ship can send ecm drones across the grid to ecm the fighters you're talking about? is this a real world example or is this a I can put ecm drones on his drones in a 1v1 situation? a single ship with a role bonus toe cm on drones could be made i.e ecming the target nullifies his drones and then you become a lightning rod to get killed. seems really simple solution to half the fucking issues around fighters and drones atm.
---
You were literal trash tier and still are. 
---
Well looks like a fit from 2008 :P maybe it’s a real legacy titan 
---
Oh, yeah. That would make sense

I often feel like i am completely changing games when changing ships/fits. For instance i have spent last 2 days stranded in wormhole systems site hunting, mostly in completely unpopulated systems. That felt like i am comletely alone in the universe. Just exploring cool places... And getting some loot ofc. :) 
---
Then i went back to civilization to finally tackle the Sisters of Eve epic questline and i was immediately contacted by a guy who was giving out ships and there was so many people everywhere, i was almost overwhelmed. 
---
And then i started doing missions and it almost feels like a standard MMO where you are killing NPCs, but in space.
---
Then there is the whole mining and market thing, if you want, yo never have to leave highsec (boooooooring). 
---
My account is 4 days old and i am total noob, but i am loving every second. :D
---
I like the sound of siege cruisers. Maybe add some short range point defence? 
---
Keep in mind engineering complexes have bonus to time and material efficiency, so it’s cheaper and faster to build in them 
---
Do you want someone thats not an autistic retard to build that site for you?

Back in the day I would have \_loved\_ for a way to turn my 24/7 gameplay into advancement of my character/ ability to fly the things I wanted to fly.

---
This is not completely accurate for you can jam drones and fighters
---
in what world is it reasonable to need 73 people to take down 1 person? like, what happens if you have 500 supers on field, am I required to bring 36,500 players with this 1 module to counter this? or that many bombers so we can alpha the supers? explain to me why I'm stupid for thinking supers shouldn't have impunity over every player in the game not in a super.
---
You can dock but no installable services work. 
---
What's walking in station?
---
Do guns still shoot?
---
You can shoot a drone, you can web a drone, you can smartbomb a drone.
---
You can't shoot a gun or launcher. 
---
They are cheap due to injectors and they are everywhere due to same reason. 
---
Yes
---
Not as fun as some of the past trailers but it's a pretty good intro to the game. Would have gotten me interested.
---
And just because I like hurting my brain I just went figured how to get a full date array (Well all the dates between two dates) working properly 
---
Yes.
---
in a world where you spent 25 BILLION isk for one ship. Is it too much to ask to at least be able to defend it before it gets dunked by a combined value of 35B in bombers? It' not a Person-Person fight. It's about investment. Why should a 10-man bomber gang be able to kill supers? That makes no sense at all.
---
The fact that flying high SP ships is likened to cheating just illustrates the fact that the high SP ships need a nerfbat/ cost increase.
---
I have the same fitting!
---
If the Moros got buffed and was **too good**, the issue is that Moros is **too good.**  
---
Not the fact that people are able to use the ship.
---
Sure, the overpowered tool would be in the hands of fewer people. But it would be overpowered and thus should be nerfed to a proper level of power. 
---
awesome ty sir
---
I'm not advocating that, I'm just saying the barrier to entry right now to me, is way to high, you can't threaten a rorq without a 100+ people available, that seems absurd, you can't fight back against outnumbered capitals because your structures do cock meat damage to them, there is no like method for any group that doesn't have players who have invested 2 years in the game already, to compete or even play an a manner that isn't by default getting ass fucked.
---
The train times to get into a carrier and super carrier are fucking lunacy, the amount of money you make from super and titan ratting is almost as game breaking as rorq mining is, which I might add is another thing you can only do with a year + training time on an alt character. 
---
THIS is not a healthy state for the game, something has to fucking budge, these ships either have to become far more accessible which is ass aids, or they need to be balanced in a way where it's not total fucking mayhem on players who don't have 2 years invested in the game. This is a real fucking issue, instead of denying it and pretending shits ok can we at least fucking acknowledge there is some disparity here?
---
Or they are cheap because of material cost and huge insurance payout.
---
the reason for that is that people like you complain for months and often years and still keep playing(and paying, plex or not). 
---
Why would they change their game when you and most others are ok with paying for it as it is
---
I told multiple times that insurance on any ship above cruiser should be removed. 
---
Yes but defenses are limited
---
They should really use these diamond NPCs more. What if we had random diamond fleets roaming around the universe taking gates/attacking structures? Could make for some really fun emergent gameplay. 
---
Also added it into the Public one if you wanna look at how I did it :P
---
Wasn't that much of a pain in the ass to do as I thought it would be
---
Or... they could try trusting that they're blue for the duration of a fight and exercise caution the rest of the time?  
---
Without the imperium giving you guys support you would have died off long ago.  Dont get too ahead of yourself.  Snuff is easily dispatched when one wants to take the time to do it.  But then you would probably just run back into the imperiums arms should anyone actually go to war with you. 
---
I also don't understand why any of this is relevant to gate camping Frulegur, which, I believe, is still  your main activity
---
Thats all?   Well at least its easily replaced for us as i think the titan pilots all were reimbursed before their pods loaded home station.  
---
I literally just started playing yesterday and even though I have no idea what’s going on I’m enjoying it. Totally awesome universe to immerse myself in and Im exciting on spending many more hours on Eve!
---
You think I'm incapable of imagining doing other activities? Idgi your point here.
---
Reddit needs 2fa because I'm p sure dancul hacked into your account and is facepalmposting for you 
---
Of course the skill time is lunacy. They are the biggest ships you can fly ingame after all. They are big game. In order to hunt and kill them you need the right tools, specialized equipment and a group of people you can rely on. People that actually know the mechanics and know how and when to warp to a ping and back again.
---
You don't hunt elephants with three dudes sharing a stick after all. 
---
Nyxes have died left right and center to 20ish dudes in leshaks and lokis. There we have the investment again: leshaks + skills are expensive as fuck but they CAN and WILL melt capitals. Don't believe me? Check zkill for leshaks and search for yourself. 
---
No, I think you lack experience from other activities.  Jamming fighters, for instance, by small gangs when killing carriers.
---
Oh no
---
Leshaks are a great ship, I really look forward to flying one someday,  and no skill points are not something that you need to spend time on, once you get a super, you basically play on god mode getting 300-500 mil an hour at bare minimum, you can literally buy an injector and go in to anything down your skill line that you don't have perfect and pop it up. 
---
The fact we can't even see eye to eye on the lunacy of this system is bizarre. 
---
Looks like he had no mining permit. Sad
---
I was in pandemic horde for 4 months, during the war last year. I get you think my recent kill board history is my only experience but I went through the null fuck ass cancer to get to my current destination and it's a primary reason for residing where I do (lowsec)
---
Smartbombs ... maybe they have bomber infestation that they need to deal with.        
---
active armor tanked, smartbombing clone bay rag
---
yea that's an ALOD waiting to happen
---
An active tank FAX can tank 35B in bombers.  Capitals as a group are ridiculously strong.
---
There are some skills and items you can't use as an alpha. They will be considered "turned off", so even if you trained them it will be like you haven't (but all will be good if you move back to omega).
---
You should still get most combat skill to IV and some to V (small turrets, maybe even medium I'm not sure), all T1 ships. No mining barge, cloak, cyno, no invention. Still pretty decent way to move back into the game.
---
Bud this like pleas can we have disabled transparency by default............             
---
Can we get ability to DISABLE THE DAMN TRANSPARENCY WHEN WINDOWS ARE PINNED                 
---
Like fuck this transparency  
---
Underrated comment. 
---
Amazing troll post
---
Why stop at a meteor?  Go all out for the Siberian traps.
---
I'm a 1 month old high sec miner in a friendly local tiny corp, and I'm starting to lose my drive. 
---
I believe I need a purpose for my mining, other than just selling my ore for cash. Would there be any point of stockpiling tons of veldspar, pyroxeres, scordite and other minerals in order to build something grand or massive in a few months? Or convince my corp to start a project of some sort? I have no idea of what to aim for because I've got such a limited knowledge of the game. I'm enjoying Eve at the moment, but I'm afraid I'll suddenly realize that I'm just mining and mining for absolutely no reason. 
---
So like from Test space to Delve or from delve to fountain?
---
Neither would the total skill points in eve.  The char bazzar would eventually become industrialized, with someone realizing they can make shitloads of isk by making blanket spectrum, long train chars.  And some people did do this.
---
Injectors are the only SP sink in the game outside of players quitting and bio-massing.  You will ofcouse argue that SP was not a commodity before injectors, but people will counter saying it was via bazzar, and now we are just arguing over magnitude and ease of use.
---
The injectors are a whole other can of worms I'm not opening right now. My stance on that is that any capital skill shouldn't be injectable. 
---
Let's turn this thing around: What minimal fleet would you suggest should be able to kill a supercarrier? Let's say a armor tanked nyx with 20m EHP (going low, because some scrubs still don't use hg slaves in their nyx)
---
goon pets will be goon pets

none of this would have happened if your neuts were actually neuts.
---
I can't mine on an empty stomach!
---
It is not a guide.
---
ah, so you're also one of the guys insecure enough to think people get triggered by being called faggot
---
One keeps total SP = total SP
---
The other removes 20-70% of SP from the game as a sink.
---
and then I listen to fleet comms and feel surprised this shit doesn't happen more often.
---
why you cargo scan that badger with 350m

it doesnt even matter if these are bots or not. they are breaking the EULA just by multiboxing Alpha accounts.

Well it is an option since in the post it seemed like you see none to counter drones/fighters, which is a little bit baffling to me, so I just tried to give you options. I don't think the new triglavian ships are meant to "handle" the drone or fighter "problem" since I don't think there is one. As I said just lots of options to defang drone boats...

Highsec "Mining" corps are death traps and lead people like you to quit. Leave and find something more engaging, please.
---
Id like to start by saying this tournament went smoother than it had any right to be considering it was a completely new project.  
---
That said there are a few things you could consider moving forward.  
---
1. Consider putting a little more time between matches. One of the ways you could fill the time is interviewing captains that have been knocked out of the tourney to get their opinion on the competition and the meta(commentators and analysts rarely have the knowledge of those who participate because they dont practice and have flight experience with the rulesets)
---
2. More consistency with countdowns. There were moments where referees asked if both teams are ready then before both captains affirmed ready the countdown would start. Its fine not to make sure both teams are ready as long as the teams have been on field for a few minutes and have had time to plan. Matches can be won or lost based off of planning in comms before countdown. 
---
3. Advertise the tournament on reddit maybe a month or so in advance. There will be people who wont be able to watch live on short notice. 
---
4. Advertisements: There were over 1k viewers for that stream. Im sure there are a lot of people who would like to advertise their corp, alliance, or service. It could also help to promote viewer engagement. 
---
5. We got access to thunderdome the day of the matches. This was reeeeeeeeaaaaaallllllllly rough. For some people we cant copy over our default settings from TQ and need to get used to a different team mate's overview and set up a lot of hotkeys before we are even ready to get in a ship. 
---
6. A fun thing you might be able to do with the analysts while waiting for a match is bring up a fit from a comp that died (for comps that cant be brought again) and talk about the reasons the team decided to fit them the way they did.
---
And that's really all I can think of for now. Can't wait to fly in the next one. 
---

and then you have a player sitting on a random gate to enjoy the view to get suddenly attacked and killed from out of nowhere because the wrong things are disabled and brackets hidden because that's how Overview packs work, in general. Hide as much as possible and make dedicated tabs.

Way to go, yeah, not so much.

---
This just seems like you want to 1v1 a 30 bil ship with a 300 mil ship. Wanna 1v1 it? Titan. You need to aim for just a carrier.

The hel that killed me in derelik was a hel that gate jumped from a hard cast warp. There's something wrong if one of the most powerful ships in the game is so worthless in cost that people don't fear losing it so boldly to jump gates in lowsec with no eyes in system.
---

lol Snuff are such pussies. They cant get any super kills without awoxing and when they do try to get them they usually get owned badly.
---
On the other hand we have TAPI. An alliance with 15k characters who has to ask Snuffies (1300 chars) if they can move some caps through lowsec LMAO
---
I agree with all of this. EVE doesn't have a single 'current' trailer - all of them are relevant, and all of them are available to prospective new players. Some may be drawn in by "The Butterfly Effect", others by this one.

---
Also retweeted a poll about 'avatar based gameplay' the day before. I'd guess avatar based gameplay is something that BDO devs would push for and to be honest why not? It's their expertise, perhaps some aspects of the engine could be copied over. Not saying it's a great idea just that it's somewhat understandable and they can take advantage of some economies of scale since the merger.
---
Someone didnt actually play when the games entire development stopped to a stand-still for a year+ so they could release a room.

Does the magnetar wormhole drone penalty apply to fighters?
---
Well, you can't just say that without givin' us the whole story, now.

I m absolute behind the fact that only gameplay should matter. At least ccp make a lot more iak with injector because the cost isk/Sp is higher with injector

It's not me, it's the EULA. Learn what it is, it legally binds the company ; the post from falcon does NOT - it *explains* how the company understood and dealt with the issue at that time.
---
CCP can NOT legally ban people who respect the EULA. The EULA specifies what is forbidden, among them is not talking in a chat using a broadcasting tool. Thus talking in a chat through a broadcasting tool is not a bannable offense. That is FACT and LAW. Whatever else your "think" is just you childishly refusing to be told you are wrong.
---
So CCP can NOT legally ban marshy for having talked in multiple chats. They however may look more suspiciously at his activities, and ban him the moment he uses a broadcasting tool for illegal use (and I hope they do it, like for any other body ).
---
Well the question ist speculative in nature, so I'm genuinely interested in your view of the matter. 
---
Look and feel of excessiveness seems to be quite subjective. Have you ever flown a carrier? Not asking to judge you, just looking for common ground. 
---
I mean the problem was you saw what you wanted to see, not what was written. If you'd asked Hy straight up are you going to attack us and he said no, then that would be lying.
---
You asked him (sort of) and he waved his hands and said look over here at this fight, isn't it interesting. You took that as him saying no. 
---

---
They seem to barely have the resources to balance the game. If they somehow allocate hundreds of man hours on some dumbass wis then I dont even know. 
---
And I'm saying that having nothing to do with PGLs latest retard crusade, CCP have proven unable to work on balancing because they couldn't allocate time to it. 
---
Theres so much wrong with the game and people asking for WIS smh
---
...yet there is a holly grail in eve .... and i´m missing it as much as i would miss your boni!
---
Ouch, I guess I'm in the Highsec Trap! 
---
What I believe I would enjoy the most is to put together an economic engine rather than engaging in PvP, at least for the time being. Maybe just try to look for an active corp doing a bit more of the risky stuff.  
---

NEWS AT 11: Vily too dumb to read between the lines.
---
I've been playing for almost a year since I've gotten back. My experience with capitals has always been on the butt end of them. I've killed a few, but not without overwhelming force or citadel assistance etc. The only subcap I feel has any fair shot of surviving caps is Hics and they get eaten by fighters if they aren't protected unlike when they tackle dreads etc.
---
I fly primarily shield ships and my armor skill points are very weak, so I really not only don't have a grasp of what's right or wrong in terms of armor ship capitals but armor ships in general feel gross to me, more than likely because my skill points aren't very high in them.
---
But they are so friendly, how could ever I leave them and their comfy lifestyle in order to pursuit my own selfish happiness?  :'(

They don't know how to fit any ships- They make the game, not play it. Players have been doing the math on the best fits in eve since 2003. CCP sit in the background releasing new updates.
---
&gt; You fit 7 beam lasers and 1 pulse

7 Soviet Union Wyverns were tackled in the south by some PanFam roam some years ago. Tehy could not break their shield recharge in TiDi, and as it was shortly after Phoebe Jumprange Nerf, PL than gated a Titan/SC-Group trough 2 regions to kill them. That was the last occasion I heard of the infamous OP-Shield-Recharge-in-TiDi-Wyverns.

You are legit retarded. Supercarrier and titan are the end game of EVE, saying they should be beaten by 5 people in a T1 subcap is like saying in WoW "I want to one shot every boss in mythic mode and get free loot", it's stupid and would kill the pve side of the game. What you are asking is giving you a small gang guy the opportunity to take down someone who invested hundred hours of grinding and month of training vs someone who take some hours of grinding and days of training. On a final point, the last time CCP made the game for smaller entity to fight big entity they made Fozziesov who killed nullsec fight, they made the damage cap who made structure fight a pain in the ass and they made rorqual meta.
---
Just get good, if you want to kill a super do not ask CCP to give you free kills, learn how to kill it with a few, try to recruit more people to take down your objective, look at zkillboard sometimes, some fax die from small gang (Like RGSU a goon corp who hunt botting supers in the north). Asking CCP to do the dirty work for you is pathetic, you should really stop taking shortcut, eve is not one of them.
---
sponsored by CCP since theres a topic on their official forums, a lot of scamming going on now but technically its trade protected by ccp so, scammer gets banned you get isk back after a few days.
---
Pretty much exactly what it sounds like.
---

I heard thats the new "Mining Abyss", where you can mine in full safety and finaly go fully afk on grinding ISK.
---
Yeah, is it CPU or Powergrid?
---
WiS was caught up with monoclegate and 10k trousers. That is what killed it. Tech has moved on and so has the player base. I think it should come back. Even as a social only thing. Gambling isk with your corpie in your astra etc. Make it only for ancillary stuff....at least at first.

I still remember when there were learning skills.

heres a solution, to turn on cyno you cant have weapons timer
---
LMAO I remember lady Scarlet 
---
Walking in stations is what would have guaranteed wider appeal for eve, not saying that CCP was necessarily capable of delivering it, but the player's short sighted temper tantrum really cut off the future of EVE.
---
yes sir sorry sir :(
---
something something havent injected the t2 spec yet.....

I would be more scared waking up next to feline ferocity

Do you have a valid mining permit?

If not you can buy one from me.

oooofff

the best thing that never happened

Thank you, your request was accepted by the dev team and it will be patched next downtime.

---
Not necessarily true.
---
But I do agree that many alliances exist in their present form because Goons allow them to. There are certain avenues of the game where other entities typically cannot compete with Goons on, but eradication of an alliance occurs from the inside nowadays, and that's not so easy to cause as an external entity.

Friendly reminder: If this is about a bug or something broken, please be sure to also make a report in the bug reporting system. If its really bad, you can poke CCP_Goliath on reddit with the EBR number, but the bug report system is the best way to do it. You may now resume to your regular shitposting program.

Here's the part you keep missing the first part of the EULA explains that the company is allowed to change the EULA  AT ANT TIME, FOR ANY REASON.
---
No they won't. The killbord is not a bad thing is just how people interpret it that is. ex: only red = bad, only green = good. That's just stupid, but it's hard to change people's point of view regarding this.
---
Maybe he want some magic wand ... working similar way to entosis link

Nice find. That's an interesting story.

Thanks for the information everyone, I like hearing about the history from those who were around at the time. 
---
They are in the process of adding more Bsccchhh and then WiS will be right back
---
I had over a million unallocated SP from it when I came back.
---
Goon's FC's top tier, thats a good one
---
Automatic anti drone/fighter turrets. Like a defender missile just for drones/fighters
---
3) Having no clue and don´t bother to investigate into hauling. 
---
It´s not all about RMT/Getting populuar. I once lost a crazy expensive blinged Navy BB that was fully fitted but not combat capable because I just transferred it as a present for someone. People kept asking me I was about to RMT shit, tried to become popular or failed a "pinata" for some event. Shit happens from time to time. We´ve all been there I guess or well, most of us. 
---
This DST is beyond reason for sure but then you have really, really clueless people and/or people that are "touching the sky" while trucking around. Again, been there no need to redo it. Pre-Plex vault for example I nearly lost 12 (old) plex meant for my other char because I threw them into a Leopard to trade them over, forgot about it and undocked with the Leo a few days later. Only reason I didn´t got blown up was the fact that I always use instant undocks. Pretty much had brown pants when I realised what I just did. :D
---
lmao
---
I actually think this is one of the not shit ideas I have seen for this
---
How would you know?
---
One of he few times where I am totally on Snuffs side. 
---
I am really, really bad when it comes to reading between lines and all this weirdo social skills stuff but I mean, why would anyone think Snuff agreed to some temp blue or non aggression thing?
---
remember, Greed is good.
---
One wants to, and the other has labeled the capital ship group has on oppression the likes eve hath never done seen before.
---
That's true, but SWG also had random material stats. Abyssal mods introduce something akun to this, but in SWG it was all random.
---
Still get goosebumps everytime i watch the Inferno trailer
---
as scrub that just started to try solo pvp now and then i want to use all the stuff that i "know" in theory in actual fights 
---
every fight where i manage to stay calm and actually use stuff i read about/was told to do is a victory for me (because i still spaghetti in fights alot) 
---
Smedley was one of the driving forces behind nuetering it.
---
If you or someone you love has lost skill points due to negligence - you may be entitled to compensation.  Contact Dewey,  Poddem,  and Hou in-game for a free consultation.  If you have a clone,  you have a lawyer.  Dewey,  Poddem,  and How.

There's this guy with a Molok in Snuff, he has the biggest balls out of the whole game flying it with us.
---
Never gang warp when the gate is in fleet.
---
Am also Irish, can also confirm that i can't see the accent.
---
I disagree. You don't just haphazardly fit up a DST like that and then fill it with 500 bil in shit. In fact, in order to get the said 500 bil you need to be active in the game for quite awhile (And it's not a credit card warrior as there's only about 200 billion ISK worth of plex posted as reasonable sell orders in the entire universe right now). So I don't think for 1 second this was an "oops". He knew what he was doing, and just wanted to get onto reddit as "that retard".... EVE People are weird..
---
Your moronic picture impied you want to use Mid Slot Ewar against Drone Damage types ala Tracking Distruptors, or Sensor Damps.
---
All of which work on drones, and some work on either the drone or the ship.  Stop being a shit bad.
---
We'll, if you look at active super and titan chars vs number of toons in the alliamce, we are very scary :D for titans, we have it down to every 12th toon is a titan basically.
---
What's Pi, and I too am sad Dust is gone. CCP fucked up by not releasing it on PC in my opinion.
---
Goes smart-bombing pve, dies to T3C on a gate.  Blames supers.

wormholer btw

Well, it's pretty difficult to gank an Apoc with one or two Catalysts.

You're struggling to fit rapid lights on a loki?

I'll one up you. When a frig entosis a capital or larger ship, that entosised ship ejects its owner and the ship is teleported to the frig owner's hanger.      /s
---
Oh dunno, maybe its because the modules used to reduce damage or application of turrets and launchers work against drone damage as well?
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

Well, I am bad with social skills, like really bad so to me the reasoning could be anything from getting famous to "fuck you corpmates" to whatever. Nothing makes sense to me except the "fuck you corpmates" thingy. I totally agree on the "EvE people are weird." thingy though. 
---
I started the game exactly 5 years ago today. But i loved the politics and history. 
---
Love talking with people and my goal was to make something an alliance in sov. 
---
Did that so now i want to help in making coalitions bigger. But not take the game too serious anymore was my big want. Honetly more people should work on that too
---
just add a damage cap to all subcaps so carriers cant do that much damage to them   /s
---
We do run a faction warfare rookie corp in Amarr militia aimed at getting new pilots up to snuff PvP wise. I'd say, if you're quick about it,  you can get yourself into a PvP capable ship within a week or two, we've got a pretty focused skill plan for that. We can show you the ropes if you want. 
---
Shouldn't you do the good cans first in case somebody chases you out of the site? 
---
They're also mostly present for maintenance and other busywork. Crewing a capsuleer ship is supposed to be heinously boring (excepting when the ship is actually threatened)
---
please
---
Why would you post this with a TAPI flair :(
---
Hence why they should take their time with dicking around with other things. 
---
Thats a shame. Still Real life over EvE.
---
I'll come at it front another angle. I have a friend I've been trying to lure into eve. He's not interested in epic battles or empire building, or betrayals and backstabs. He likes the economics and the industry of it. He likes the idea of the fact that the entire economy is player driven, that everything in space is built by players. This trailer did a great job appealing to people like him. 
---
Did you guys also notice the NPC tempests killing the cit?
---
Be careful though: this way you are missing opportunity to suddenly have the most fun content you can get off your titan.
---
If you get in a small agile ship, then set a tight orbit of 500m around a can or something with MWD on, you can give yourself nausea very effectively. 
---
yea , but likely on a AVATAR, where the armor tank is excusable

Planet mining, you drop structures onto planets to mine them.

Didn't want those titans and supers anyway. Already replaced.

To be honest Smedley killed pretty much every SOE game.

Hojoooooooo :)

Depends on how fast you want to go. I got a phantasm that will clear T4s in 10 minutes or so. Can run 4-5 sites per hour

I didn't know you could actually fill a cargo hold with blueprints and skins...let alone a cargohold that big. I would think that would take hundreds of billions of ISK...oh. Wait....

Thanks for the long form feedback, really appreciate it!

It is hilarious how no one seemed to be able to comprehend that things would stay cosmetic only, when now cosmetic only micro transactions are basically standard on the industry

Good overview too

I'm betting that those aren't even capital-sized reps.

Most importantly, because it has good consequences in real life and it will carry on after the servers shut down, I've

- improved my spoken English vastly.
---
Aside, I feel my personal victories are that I've
---
- trained enough SP not to care much about skill training (after I trained into a Redeemer),
---
- farmed enough ISK not to care much about farming (after I bought my first super),
---
- did enough elite pvp not to care much about being elite (after I left Snuff),
---
- got enough kills not to care much about killboards (after I reached 1k kills),
---
- found my niche in the game that I like the most (lowsec gatecamping),
---
- found nice people throughout the years,
---
- never paid RL money.
---
Guess it didn't matter cause you probably lost the super while losing your pod
---
I spent 2 months PvPing an an Alpha, got 200 odd kills, about 50  of them solo, so its definitely possible to murder people as an alpha. If you're looking for pew pew and isk, maybe take a look  at faction warfare. Running complexes pays for our hulls and fits, and you're essentially getting paid to wait for pvp. We do also recruit and teach alphas, so if you're interested, drop me a line. 
---
There's a lot going on in this comment
---
Reping a dread.? 
---
Do you not siege your dreads?
---
&gt; people i dont consider enemies
---
Since when you guys (or Snuff) are NRDS? This might help you:
---
NRDS - we're shooting our enemies.
---
NBSI - we're shooting everyone except our allies.
---
Eve is building from a blueprint, there never was any doubt in the end product. I prefer this, it removes 'luck' from the equation. You don't 'accidentally' make the best sword by building 100 of them, you do it by using better methods, or better materials.
---
Whilst I enjoy a good abyssal roll as much as the next guy, I'm glad the majority of the game isn't based on luck.
---
The gankers certainly seem to make a habit of taking down transports. Wonder what they do with all those ISKies? Hmm??
---
Obviously someone litterally didn't read the memo
---
That is actually accurate. If one is to ask Goons - we are very trustworthy, honored every agreement to a letter, always stuck to our commitments and behaved in a very honorable and open way towards our direct allies. 
---
If one is to ask BL, SC or Test - we are extremely untrustworthy. 
---
How would they know this? Not like we used this approach to most our engagements for the last three years.... oh, wait...
---
There is a lot of problems that have been highlighted that won’t even change pve at all. You don’t use dromis and sirens, it wouldn’t cost anything to just tweak their speed and hp. Meanwhile the cehe change was a big mistake and ended up nerfing dreads further instead of faxes it should never have made it through and has to be iterated ASAP especially now that wormholers have trig ships. There are things like Moros stats that nobody will ever argue about and that only need to replace one digit by another. Meanwhile we had the Nyx buffed by 25% with the event implant just as people complain about supers. Took forever to fix. Just lol. Ccp balance is a joke. They seem to have no idea how capitals work. I’m not even sure i want a rebalance because they will want to make new cool things and just fuck everything up.
---
When EVE Online goes offline permanently and players discuss why, this point will inevitably elude them.
---
And to think you wouldn't need to jump or bridge if there was a lowsec gate to Stain.
---
Bot that's just come back to the game after 10 years away and just taking back up where he left off.
---
Its like the entire eve population forgot the Character Bazaar existed before skill injectors.  
---
I mean, if I was in Test (again), the person to get shit on here would be the person who gladly discussed the details of my supercapital move op with neutrals.
---
They died after being evicted other than a few dudes who merged into FERRA, who will claim full credit and say it was Stain all along when we eventually get evicted by some other entity in a series of events unrelated to anything Stain does.
---
And the full log ahdn't changed anything XD
---
The real answer is, when you are doing QA assurance for software like this, you have to test ridiculous configurations of things *because there will be players* with the same stupid ass fits. 
---
Ditto!

Nah I had a sitter with no drone skills
---
When you are new, it's very unlikely that you will be able to afford one, let alone several, skill injectors. The idea is good*ish*. The problem is the market. They go for what, 1.6 bil? Try making that when you just learned what the warp button does.
---
who isnt pets to Goons nowadays, if the wanted they could go and have an all out blue donut

Mad reps

no wonder test is full of furries

Hint : Stain is out of range for any kind of combat shps. Only JF and rorquals can reach if from lowsec

Armor ragnaroks are more common than you'd think.

well you see em on zkill alot

"This is you on injectors"

tell us more

I am new to EVE, but from what I've learned so far, the only accepted way to repay any form of help and support , is to rob the corporate hangar or anything else you can get your hands on.
---
J/K, very nice story, I'm really glad you found such exceptional friends and turned your life around.
---
Evictus also used to be part of Provibloc, remember
---
CVA Also enforced a carrier ban on all of Provibloc for a long time, if you lost a carrier under this rule to reds, there was usually a *hefty* fine.
---
Which is why it was so awesome to find one when you were hunting!
---
CCPs fits are as good as StainGuys posts
---
And the SRP was appreciated. It was a direct agreement and you followed it through. Which is awesome. 
---
But here lies the difference - SNUFF only operates by direct agreements. We can work together with someone, but every time it is for a specific fight with sides and conditions agreed beforehand. It's never long term. Even INIT won't assume anything like that.
---
Eh, i generally have the time to do the cans.
---
To be honest, I prefer to run and leave a can rather than lose my ship and all the goods I gathered.

Dear god I miss swg. I adored JTL, nothing has come close since.

Do you have a valid permit to sell mining permits? If not you can buy one from me. 
---
Just started playing last year. My victory right now is that last month I finally got trained into the ship I needed for the one Corp doctrine I was missing. So now I have at least one ship for each of our fleets. That and I was able to be logi anchor for the last fight I was online for.
---
Yonis have biggest balls flying with us. Almost every fleet we do a poll "awox yonis if blueballs?" with 90% majority voting yes...
---
My first personal victory (i am playing for 4 days only) was when i got myself stranded in c1 wormhole, because i went into it, scanned first site, warped to it and forgot so save the location of the entry wh. 
---
So then, after a few hours scanning (yes, i am noob and there were a lot of undiscovered places in that one) i realized i have to go to sleep and i dod not found the wh back yet. Luckily, there was some kind of a base in that wh that did not shoot me down and even let me land there, so i can spend night. 
---
Next day when i logged in, the first signature i scanned was the wh that took me back exactly where i left of. Loot: about 5M (i really, really suck at hacking), but i had a ton of fun. 
---
So, i found a way out and jumped out, only to find a new wh and jumped right back in. Only to be contacted by a a vetern player, that the new hole i just jumped through is closing in a couple of seconds. I managed to get out in time and thanked him for his kindness. 
---
The biggest victory from all this is, that there are good guys in this game. Well, at least to 3 days old players stranded in wh with tier1 party fitted Heron. :D
---
I would be very surprised if they didn't bring back walking in stations. I doubt they've scrapped the foundations they have and we all have full 3D character models. 
---
Personally I hope we do get it but not at the detriment of more pressing matters. Hopefully these separate things would be handled by different teams. 
---
the real stainguy is in the comments ...
---
instanced titan PvE
---
I'm not arguing any of that in this thread. I'm merely calling out OP's laziness. OP wants cloaky camping nerfed because he's not willing to undock and grind isk if there's an enemy in local. Cowardice shouldn't be rewarded in EVE. I get the impression OP just wants to AFK rat and a cloaky camper makes him feel uncomfortable.
---
Instead of using one of several solutions I listed above, OP wants CCP to nerf an aspect of the game that's not unbalanced.
---
I'll leave the discussion about cyno balancing for the 20 other dedicated threads that will surely pop up this week.
---
...I mean, everyone sometimes does that, sure, but in secret. Why would you admit of this shameful behavior publicly though?..
---
Surely the code from the firsts iteration of WiS still exists. Just turn it back on for stations and let a few guys design new rooms for citadels etc. 
---
I highly doubt they would actually scrap that many man-hours of code. 
---
I want to nerf injectors. I think they are fine, particularly for new players; however, there is really no excuse for them to work beyond 25m skill points... other than, of course, as a method of milking money out of the demand for them from eve's super rich.
---
And just to be clear, injectors a *definitely not* pay to win. Nope. Not at all, CCP. 
---
Well the first part of pvp is dying.  A lot.
---
Then you do research and learn about scram kite, optimal ranges, how far you can point with overheat on, etc.
---
You die a lot more but you figure out what you did wrong
---
Then you might get your first kill
---
that's some rookie numbers, I had 6 mil unallocated SP when I dig up my first char.
---
Its not about the fit being good or bad. It's about it being more a PvE fit than a PvP one. PvP fits have tackle and cap booster in mids usually. That shit is dual cap recharger and dual prop? It's more likely that its fit for belt ratting than PvP
---
Frenemies more like
---
&gt;QA assurance
---
Do you have a permit tosell permits to peolle who sell mining permits, if not you can buy several from me.
---
&gt;d buy characters on th
---
You could. Characters that took people, depending on what you were looking for, years to train. I think the OP is complaining that the injector system allows for people to skip all of those years of training, which has led to a proliferation of cap and supercap pilots. 
---
In other words, without those injectors, the supply of cap and super-cap characters was limited by the time it took to train all of those skills. 
---
Now, one might argue, "hey, people had to extract those skill points from somewhere, so time is still being invested, what's the big deal?"; however, you and I both know that the reality of the situation is people have started making a living in eve by having hundreds of alphas they train simultaneously for 6 months, then extract the skill points from. 
---
Hugely different than training a pilot for 3 years to fly a Titan. 
---
Evictus do this? Really it sucks a lot.
---
Who knows how any of that shit was implemented and maintained, by any standard it shouldnt have never taken that long in the first place. 
---
It was the "no way man that would never happ" you just need to listen closely

Don't lie to us, those definitely didn't go unused.

Don't give away the location of our secret treehouse.

You didn't need much more luck than T2 inventionto make the best sword in SWG, so long as you had the best resources and crafting gear.
---
hat at fanfest
---
Nice ;)
---
I felt this in my bones
---
Maybe a little, but it is a whole lot easier for people, like I said, to have 200 alpha accounts that they train for 6 months and extract. On top of that, in the old days "farming" Moros pilots:
---
1. Costed the 'farmer' $14.95 a month to train; AND 
---
2. Ran the risk of having a game mechanic change (like the loss of the Moros's drone bonus) changing the dread flavor of the month, making the investment in time and money far more risky. 
---
Drama tax? 
---
Your wrong, snuff is neutral ingame to TEST, that implies by default they are allied.
---
did you try sorting overview by size, or type?
---
i head to the isho system near jita. ishomilken or somethin like that; its close to jita but doesnt go through tama so its safe. you can pay someone to in the "Haulers Channel" channel to move stuff for you pretty cheap to the hs system right outside and set your deathclone
---
If winning at life has a meaning, this is it!
---
Hey everybody can lose stuff to Wormhole Rollers while Ratting. C2 statics are sneaky. But i will never defend people that frequently lose Haulers to Hisec-Wardecs while Corp/Alliance offers neutral hauling services. One time is ok, but if you don't want to learn you deserve being killed and made jokes of ... my 2 cent  ... so while the mail and the payments are retarded, the people in the killmails were too for sure ...
---
As funny as his reaction is, theres nothing wrong with being salty after a loss (after all, you just lost something!). While most of us can laugh off random 100m losses, it really hurts other players. Hence some people write "GF" others act like this dude...
---
Theres also being a good winner and not creating a reddit thread to mock some random dude.

Was going to post this

I HAVE BEEN IN THIS PLACE BEFORE
---
Underrated comment
---
Actually we tend to do it to diversify what kind of icons are on screen so that every set of controls in the UI doesn't look the same.
---
That's why you'll sometimes see ships with odd groupings of guns, or weapons that don't have ammo loaded into them so that they show a different icon than a stack of ammunition.
---
I had a succ? Nah who am I lying to
---
That's /r/shitfits material right there
---
Nope. You can have a specialized super cap pilot at around 30 million SP. It's just that, in the old days, people trained characters from the ground up and eventually ended up in capital ships. 
---
My main is great example of this. He's got 120 million skill points, and is almost perfect when piloting carriers, dreads, and super-carriers; however, I did not start training him (this was 2011, I took a really long vacation from eve) for capital ships until I was at roughly 75 million skill points. 
---
But his call for the cloaky camping is only in response to cloaky campers wanting cynos nerfed... Both sides are pointing at the other and blaming them for everything.
---
to facilitate the sale of skill injectors
---
What
---
If impressively untanked yes, especially in 0.6.
---
quite pleasing to so see to be honest.
---
He called me a faggot lol. I didn't even write anything in local until he started sperging. Nothing for me to be proud of for killing him and I'd probably have sent him 50m if he had messaged asking how I found him. Have done that even with new players I killed that were vni ratting. 
---
OMG I hadn't seen the MWD, I thought that was just an impel fitted in 2010. 
---
&gt; Bazaar keeps the same number of high SP characters in the game, only the owner is different;
---
This is the ram touching the wall exactly. The ease at which massive *alpha clone* (thus free) skill point farms can be set up means that a medium sized farm of 200 characters can net someone over 100 million skill points for extraction in around 6 months. 
---
well, outside of really annoying them, i believe you can also extort them.  its a time honored tradition. 
---
Wow 4 months in Horde. You veteran you
---
&gt;but I actually don't know the drone mechanics.

It shows

I do! I bought one from Mittani last week.

Good Guy CCP: Suggests bad cap fits to trick injector hungry newbeans and give us all danker kills.

I know what Eve is, but like...what IS Eve?  Does it have turtles?
---
I bet that even has gyros in the low slots

Give a man a break. It's just after 8AM on the East Coast of the US. I woke up 20 minutes ago and ran to the office in temperatures below -8 degrees Fahrenheit.

Since playing for 12+ years I gotten into a super. Now purely focusing on getting to some fun small gang ships. 
---
i use z-s on my WH toon and some other one on my main Null toon , the overview on my null toon is less detailed, but has a "general" tab where it shows all ships, stations and gates wich is useful as hell, en shows NPC's and deployables, only thing it does not show is planets, collidables drones and rocks

Damn mittani, always stealing my customers.

That's output, not input.

Morgain, did you meme yourself?

1 more or less comes because it's a tactic used in asymmetrical warfare. Nano gangs are usually small, which is why they're flying nano so they can kite away and avoid big response fleets. But yeah, it's still 2.

wasn't a single one on zkill in X47 as far as I know. Those others solo deaths on zkill would've died regardless, no?

I find the ways CCP manages to break stuff part of the experience. It's like playing a different game every day and how we can exploit the fuck up xD

Yes.   Im happy i left though i think im the happiest Eve player now i Found a grand purpose. A long-term goal 
---
Which is currently the best wh mapping tool/website?
---
They've ripped out all the old code for it. In part, because it was getting in the way of future development, both from a libraries perspective, and from a testing perspective.
---
Yes, they'll still have the art assets, so it's not a total loss.
---
As long as I have people like you to fight for :)
---
Honestly I would not be surprised at all if part of the whole Pearl Abyss thing involved a spin-off or tie in game with Avatar gameplay. I am talking about like walking in stations, except for mobile. The whole mobile / Asian market we'll eat that kind of thing up. And if it means we finally get walking and stations, it will definitely be worth it.

X47 had both armor and shield fleets. I think in that case ypu would expect all rags to be shield.

In an armor fleet however i have seen rags before.

They probably are first targets, though.

well it was more a jab at the much lower survivability of an Armor rag, you can get way more EHP out of a rag if you Shield tank it, as it gets bonuses for that    
---
in a fleet its all dependent on what Fax you have, you can shieldrep an armor rag, but it wont be effecient 
---
Well the "elite" of PL+NCdot+horde+GOTG+etc didn't get the hint when several ragnaroks cynoed in on an armor cyno for an armor titan fleet. 
---
So I think if you can afford to lose one of your titans, go for it. Armor tank that rag, slap a shield tank on an erebus. Given the number of titans on field compared to how many were lost, the odds of dying was pretty slim in a titan. Heck, maybe if we fed a couple shield erebuses the north would've fought until downtime (on the armor timer where we traded pretty evenly).

The character bazaar took time though, to get the payout someone needed to train that character for the time required, not to mention the limited supply and bidding wars for the best characters.

Also considering the bumping all over i can't blame an FC to not keep track on all and every rag jumping in and where.

---
You are right, but you have to keep in mind that Eve is 15 years old now. There are people in the Target demographic for this game who were literally not born when it came out. So I think an overview video like this does a really good job of explaining what the game is, while also showing how beautiful it looks.
---
Stations.. Stations EVERYWHERE.
---
Shit. Time to change my Rag fit. Again.

That's exactly what I said when I saw that.

&gt;If we all did this maybe then ccp would fix.

&gt;  
---
&gt;so how do I actually multibox an alpha and avoid the login restriction?
---
The time is also needed for training an injector, more, actually,  considering there are penalties on injection.  Understandably you can do the training on a bunch of 5M SP accounts and just extract the 1.8M/month, but people would multi-train mining/capital accounts on character bazaar as well.
---
Skill Injectors didn't really fundamentally change the game as much as people think in my opinion, its the easy access to isk that did.  If anyone can make 15b+ isk per month, of course they'll all be in capitals in no time.
---
I have seen dumber ideas. Remember when Chance Ravinne wanted to Nerf jump freighters by preventing instant tethering after jumping? The idiot was concerned that Medium structure proliferation was going to make Eve online too Capital ships focused.
---
so wrong, you think of the wrong supers ... and also most of these survived (guess about 27 died, about 80 jumped safe)
---
No but it have bees
---
Yup, totally agree. I think the big mess up was that it was too graphics heavy too early for people. They also needed to have had more stuff ready. IMO had they held it back for a year or more, and made sure there was a way to "leave" the captains quarters and actually do something, would have made a big difference. But the playerbase rage is frustrating tbh. 
---
Lumio?
---
It’s not like that’s a new thing, goons themselves were defeated several times, but survived because they just didn’t stop forming and moved away from their enemies 
---
I'd say one of my personal *small* victories was being able to do more than just pushing F1. Being part of the military team in my alliance has been easily the most fun space job I've ever had.
---
Burning down hostiles without needing to log in is super enjoyable.
---
Yea link pls ;)

I looked through that, and it’s kind of funny just how complicated their recruitment process is. You’d think you were applying for something much more serious than an internet spaceship game 
---
"There is a storm coming"
---
Your 3 deacons don't count as a fax.
---
Jamming doesnt work anymore. Unless you sit at range, jam them and then warp off when they burn for you.
---
At which point thats retarded and its better to just bring logi and have a hefty supply of ec drones.
---
Never really thought of it that way. In SWG I was a master armor crafter, crafting only top tier armor for guild leaders to slay jedi with. In eve I peaked at making blackops and selling them to alliances but never on a huge scale. I made everything from raw materials to extract the juiciest of margins.
---
Is not really hard , is just a game you really have to learn the mechanics. Other games have complicated mechanics but you don’t really have to know it in or there to enjoy it.

Hi, I just saw the new trailer of eve online that says its now f2p and i had a few questions..
---
Is the entirity of the eve world a pvp zone? The narrator mentioned you could focus on mining, but also be a space pirate so.. can someone theoretically come in, destroy my ship and take my work of mining for an hour in the span of 2 minutes? Also, if I build a new ship and put a bunch of upgrades on it and someone comes and destroys it, do i lose all of that progress forever?
---
How exactly do microtransactions work? I heard that a year or so ago, there was a massive all out war that costed thousands of dollars of damage on both sides. So how exactly was this quantified?
---
Thanks in advance. I imagine you might have a few more curious people like me come here in the next few weeks, so detailed explanations are of course, always welcome 
---

---
I made this yesterday for the leader of my alliance, Tridgit, but I think it fits here too.
---
I think you need to cut down on the drugs.
---
I thought the same thing about the overview. I was like “who the fuck even uses default overviews?”  That would be anyone who is either lazy or doesn’t know any better. 
---
Tri, Goons and RED mainly - at least by looking at where corps moved.
---
I liked the concept of walking through a back and forth null battle with various escalations. I'm not sure it would be as cool with current mechanics
---
I don't agree that walking in stations would be that much more attractive than eve is now. I've tried to get friends into it and generally speaking they don't care for it because it's either too boring and learning curve too steep.
---
I really wish work wasn't boring so much that I regularly click on StainGuy posts.
---

That is fucking amazing bro.  Good job getting everything together. So good to here stories like this.  
---
I personally felt like falling asleep during the first 3minutes of it. When I read that a lot of people went nuts on the new trailer and it was much appreciated by a lot of peoples I was a bit baffled. Your post pretty much sums it up for me but maybe these trailers are made for a different kind of new players? The butterfly effect back then totally hooked me into EvE and the following ones were simply epic. 
---
So this man, https://zkillboard.com/kill/74192715/ that loose his carrier against venture, should have paid his thanny 2 times more? WTF
---
I laugh
---
Good thing you can now send your skill points to me and I will send them back to you doubled.
---
Serpentis 6/10 are not cool in terms how long it takes to run them.
---
Just compare guristas 6/10 ... 25min max. Serpentis based on 2 different locations, so the 2nd escalation can be in super annoying space. Guristas don't scram or anything (except the one tower in the 3rd pocket). Serpentis scram/web/neut ... means hope nobody combat probes you as long as you haven't finished all the little frigates that keep you down. Oh and don't forget about the 10 waves in the 2nd pocket takes you almost 1h to kill it entirely. And the insta warpin, ppl that combat probe don't need to take gates, they can directly warp into your pocket on top of you.
---
Holy shit this is almost exactly what i want to do (and not really there yet), mind sharing a bit how you did it?
---
Suicide ganking.
---
second point in the EULA  
---
" You may establish more than one Account for each copy of the Software licensed. You are however not allowed to play EVE by using more than one Account at the same time, unless you pay a subscription fee for each of the Accounts you intend to use for that purpose."
---
Dunno if upvote for spodbrain or downvote for top tier... Ah just downvote
---
Which part?
---
To be fair, thats how literally every video game works for the most part
---
Farming and niche
---
It's what they should have done in the first place
---
At least local shows up
---
I would counter that it is not close, in that you had control over *quality* of items in SWG.  Eve has arguably higher complexity in terms of building, but every time I build a module, its the exact same module every time.  In SWG you could get insanely (space?) rich if you could create armor with higher resists than anyone else.  
---
Both need spreadsheets though.  I had to worry less about profitability in SWG, because items also naturally decayed.  
---
I want to know which ones he's using, sounds fun :P
---
I am a dying breed.  The small gang community has lost so many good content creating players... These are not being replaced. 
---
I totally agree. Any fight were I can engage, stay calm, and dictate the fight how I want is a victory even if the other guy doesn't explode.  
---
I've had far too many fights where I got distracted by my kids and had to start a fight late or etc. I also tend to take almost any fight even when I should have run.
---
Just recently I actually had a few solo kills (not against bots). The thrasher kill was the most exciting (I was in a dramiel) because it almost took me out before I could get in range and under its guns. 
---
Sadly I lost my dram last night. I fought a vigil fleet issue and had it in structure when another dram landed on us and I couldn't take them both. Still proud of that fight though
---
&gt; Trust me when I say, as BoB demonstrated many years ago
---
Isn't it more accurate to say they knew how to cheat at their game? ;)
---
Why have 50 items on an overview that are not needed, they dont have their own bracket so you cant simply remove them as they remove an entire rooms worth of NPC in the next room at times. Its a quality of life thing. its not broken but for some people it would make things a little smoother. 
---
I'd tell you, but then you'd be taking my money.
---
No one said it was a new phenomenon.
---
Lol i didint knew that. Is there also a way for route to also include player jump gates with access ?
---
&gt; Is the entirity of the eve world a pvp zone?
---
Players can can attak others players anywhere they want, but in certain areas they will be punished for doing so (loss of their own ship). Killing someone in high security space but also dying yourself is called [suicide ganking](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Suicide_ganking).
---
&gt; The narrator mentioned you could focus on mining, but also be a space pirate so.. can someone theoretically come in, destroy my ship and take my work of mining for an hour in the span of 2 minutes?
---
Yes. It's not very likely to happen, though, suicide ganking is more done on people who are careless and moving around with a lot of ISK. You will also not spend much time in high security space (or mining) if you don't want to, you can branch out right away.
---
&gt; Also, if I build a new ship and put a bunch of upgrades on it and someone comes and destroys it, do i lose all of that progress forever?
---
Every ship loss means the ship blows up, half the equipped/carried modules/items will blow up, the other half will drop in a container for anyone to loot (including yourself, if you lost a ship in PvE or someone left your loot behind).
---
You don't have to engage in PvP if you don't want to, but that may not stop others from doing so. That's EVE, but it's perfectly possible to enjoy EVE without doing any PvP at all if you're into that.
---
&gt; How exactly do microtransactions work? I heard that a year or so ago, there was a massive all out war that costed thousands of dollars of damage on both sides. So how exactly was this quantified?
---
People tend to quantify it by taking the ingame cost of PLEX and holding it up against what people pay for PLEX out of the game. https://secure.eveonline.com/plex/
---
&gt; And lastly.. How big is the playerbase? Is it still going strong?
---
https://eve-offline.net/?server=tranquility gives you a good idea of that. Basically, the last 1-2 years player numbers have been pretty stable - there are plenty of people to interact with.
---

---
Capital in a low class wormhole.     
---
A C4 is limited to people bringing in subcaps.  This give a great advantage to the defenders that can bring carriers/dreads/etc to an eviction attempt.    
---
If you had ten solid pilots, what would be your thoughts on capital defense fleet?
---
Yes, you can get blown up anywhere. High security space, the blower-upper will get killed by 'space police's, and it does dissuade people using bigger more expensive ships to 'suicide gank', so you can theoretically make your ship tanky enough to survive it. Plus you have tools to watch who is in system, and decide if it's worth docking up and hiding or staying out. Piracy is more prevalent in low or null security space, where there's no one coming to punish those dropping you.
---
Yes, if your ship is destroyed, it's gone forever. But most mining ships pay for themselves fairly quickly, so you can use some of your profit to buy a new one and re-fit it. Free players can only get the basic mining ship, called a venture, which is dirt cheap, so risk is minimal compared to the bigger paid-player mining barges.
---
The in-game currency (ISK) can be used to buy Plex, which is the microtransaction currency used for skins, game time, etc. and can also be bought for real money. So if a ship costs X amount in ISK, and that amount of ISK would buy Y amount of Plex, then they can value the loss based on the dollar value of Y Plex.

SWG in my mind is still the greatest MMO that I have ever played...right up until Smedly completely wrecked it. I'm still bitter over it.

Woah, the 'actual' fuck? The one and very? This is serious.
---
lol k
---
Farming: my method was not to do the same thing forever, instead, I tried a new isk-making method every 2-3 months or so. Salvaging, incursions, relic/data sites were the first 3. Most effective were running level 5s with carriers before the carrier patch, and the one I do now (because why not). And after like 5 years in, I bought a JF, then sold it and bought a Rorq, then sold it and upgraded to a super, and now I'm happy to fly small stuff too, knowing that I have a super.
---
I also tried various activities, but as it turned out early into the game, I like gatecamping. So it wasn't a big relevation, I just happened to meet the best activity in the game early in my career.

---
The easist and in my opinion most efficient way to make money in High Sec, or anywhere in Eve, is to work IRL and convert some of those $, £ or € into plex, which you then sell for ISK.
---
Earning ISK in game is for pocket money or specific projects only, unless you're a nutter and can rat or mine for hours on end, every day.
---
Another good way to make ISK in High Sec is to join a nullsec bloc and not do it in High Sec at all.  High Sec was good back in 2004 but it's since been nerfed up the wazzoo.  So instead go to null and orbit anoms in a VNI or Ishtar whilst watching #learntocode memes on YouTube.

What does pirate standing effect? 
---
It's totally 4 newbie friends just mining. Why you gotta go after the newbros? 
---
/s
---
Buy more ships to lose to concord
---
incursion comms are bad because everyone's just there to make money and no one knows each other, so it's like a really terrible job
---
change my mind
---
I blame the liqueur.
---
But isnt carrier/super ratting literally crashing the economy, combined with rorqs?
---
Hasnt CCP already said that bounty income isnt sustainable due to effect on the economy?
---
So nerfing application would kill 2 birds with one stone. Its not like its hard to kill rats anyway, theyve got inflated sigs and are slow. 
---
Yeah. I know you can mute everyone except the fc but it's a ballache. Incursions are good money but they are quite intensive attention-wise so they get boring very quickly
---
Why are you on a 24 hour shift ever?
---
My first personal victory was figuring out station trading and completing the skills necessary to trade competitively (the first skills I trained).
---
Second was finding a great corp full of great like minded people. I played solo for 7 or 8 months, and while I had fun playing solo, having a corp to bond with has been a great experience.
---
Third victory was getting into my favorite ship (Kronos), marauders are my favorite class of ship, and the Kronos has always been my favorite.
---
A fourth victory has been finally getting a proper alt spun up. I've been multiboxing 2 accounts for a total of 5 or 6 hours so far, and wow, it really is a different way to play the game. My alt is in an Orca right now, skilling up to perfect drone mining skills. Perhaps someday I'll work on getting it into a rorqual, but for now I'm still getting the hang of it.
---
A smaller victory that I'd still like to mention is the first time I got comfortable in a wormhole. I'd heard stories as a noob of people getting lost in wormholes and having to self destruct. I jumped in one day, started scanning and never bookmarked a thing. I must have jumped through 5 or 6 wormholes before trying to find my way out. Turns out it's not that hard! I've always managed to find my way out to k space in twenty minutes or so. 
---
Turns out wormholes aren't so scary after all. 
---
Hello, thanks for the quick response!
---
So I assume Isk = money? Is there a centralized banking system, so I'm not carrying around my wealth? Also, how easy is it to make money/outfit your ship? If I get ganked and lose my stuff, can I easily start over and get to where I was as a beginner? How about as a mid or high level player? Other games I've played where there were equipment drops in pvp zones, you could get new equipment that was about 70-80% as effective as entry level max gear with relative ease. Is it hard climbing back up?
---
Everything gets boring very quickly.   That's why I suggest matching the goal with the activity, to keep you motivated and if you can't do that buy PLEX for ISK.  
---
The last set of incursions I did, for example, were specifically to get CONCORD LP for blueprints for something I wanted to build.  Likewise when I log in to mine ice, I'm doing it to get a specific amount of a specific type to fill something specific's fuel bay with.
---
i already quit this game because i don't like current direction, why haven't you? 
---
when was the last change/patch that improved your playstyle?
---
That would have been really awesome for people who don't understand or want to fly as you say to be able to play the game without doing the spaceship once. You make me dream.
---
Nah people don't usually don't get what i want to say. 
---
Love you, buddy.  I miss shooting the shit with you on comms.  Of all the guys I've flown with I've never found someone whose sense of humour so closely matched mine haha.  - Matt
---
As a former community-manager for some smallish niche-games I can approve. If the person doing decissions about gamedesign never leveled a toon in his very own game past 1/10th of the levels that are available( so hardly escaped the newbie-zone) you know the result d be "odd". And thats happening almost everywhere. "We dont needa know the game, we know the metrics!" - "Do you know how and why those metrics interact with each other?" - "Uhm, STFU or you re fired!"
---
I prefer incursions.
---
Less initial cost, less stressful, less hassle cashing out.
---
All ISK (money) you earn is in your wallet and can not be lost when you get killed. :) Only the ship you're flying and what is in/on the ship - the dangers from suicide ganking is usually when transporting goods around in high security that you earned elsewhere.
---
Being ganked as a new player will normally mean very little at all. It's a good idea to get somewhat used to dying (but learning from it, so it happens less and less) while you lose very little/fly cheap ships.
---
Basically, what you want to risk is entirely up to you. Don't fly what you can't afford to lose, is a pretty common tip.
---
As for earning ISK and starting out, if you stop by [the Discord](http://discord.gg/eveonline) and hang out in #newbie-help and drop your ingame name some time tonight, you'll already be off to a good start. The pinned messages there are also filled with guides, especially for exploration (which is a great way to earn ISK as a new player, mining is generally not a good idea).
---
goons and ganking ... what the hell is it with you ... just waiting when you post that you are miniluv member
---
I did incursions for a while but like others have said they get old quick. If you vary it up between dps/sniper and logi occasionally, you can stay fresher for longer, but still you will burn out. On the upside, you can make easy money. A slow fleet will pull in 100m/hr and a good one will make quite a bit more with very very little risk involved. If you're not an idiot and don't fit more than what the SRP covers, even if you pop you'll be back in the game almost right away. 
---
Never done T4s but I'd personally say you're probably better off with incursions since the isk will be more consistent. It's always bugged me when I pve and it's highly RNG based whether or not I actually get paid. Just my take though. If you like that kind of chance, take a shot at T4s for a week or so. 
---
Not as scary as highsec anyway 
---
Yeah I agree. Doing anything solely for the purpose of getting isk is something people should avoid if they don't enjoy the activity at all. If it feels like work, then do an hour overtime at your actual job and buy plex to sell for isk. Real life isk/hour &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; super ratting isk/hour
---
I'm pretty sure he's just going to list lazily to the left.
---
This, Test just assumes everyone is in the donut. 
---
Hi, thanks for all the info! There is so much to adress in that response I dont know where to start lol
---
So I assume it's a risk/reward thing? Spending time in low/no security zones results in better yields in general but also more pvp, etc?
---
So after being destroyed, how easy is it to bounce back? As a beginner, and a mid or high level player let's say? If the question seems too broad, let me know and I can try and reword it. 
---
Based on what you said about ISK and PLX, as well as the f2p mining thing.. there IS still a membership/subscription aspect to this game still huh? Can you tell me if I will be able to get an adequate sense of the game as a free player before the game forces me to become a sub because of x y z perk unlocks which are too good to pass up? You said game time so.. 10-15 usd wouldnt be enough for one month's worth of perks, but only x amount of hours in game?
---
Lastly.. is it viable to pay for membership through farming isk and buying plex with it? About how long can one expect to spend on farming for say.. a month of subscription perks?
---
That is like the t3c warping backwards bug. It happened shortly after they were released. You would initiate warp and boom reverse warp. 
---
WHY DO YOU DRAG ME INTO THIS
---
ha that's nothing i had an armor cormorant with hull rep fitted when i dig up my first char! 
---
The best isk/hr is selling your body on the street.
---
&gt; I also tend to take almost any fight even when I should have run.
---
My killboard is so red because of this. I *know* that Comet is rails fit and I don't have a chance in the scram-kite Tristan I'm in right now. But the warzone is dead, I'm bored, and if I jump all the way back to my base he'll be gone by the time I get back with a ship that can take him. What the hell, maybe I'll get lucky. (I don't)
---
Ransome... I recognise the name.  Didn't he used to be a Provi resident?  TSOE or CVA... I can't remember.  Looks like a geniune attempt to move house.  
---
What an idiot.
---
Have you ever seen the devastating ugliness of my body?
---
I see.. lol, you're making me want to try this game! I'm building a new pc atm so it wont be available for at least a month but I'll try to download the game on my current prebuilt pc sometime this week and see how it runs. I will keep the discord in mind for sure. Appreciate all the tips and info.

If you only have 10 pilots, capitals may not be the best idea because it makes you much more of a target :)
---
disclaimer: I am probably not the best one to ask about low-class capital defense. 
---
If you want to anyway (it can be fun) you can run a well tanked cap booster fax, eg Ninazu for reps, then a number of either carriers or HAW fit dreads. If the dreads run into too much trouble you can drop out of siege and receive reps from the ninazu. You would run your fax looking a little like this: [https://zkillboard.com/kill/74820631/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74820631/). The point is that your fax is almost immune to neuts if you cycle a cap booster at the same time as you rep, and you can park a DST filled with cap boosters next to it to feed it capacitor boosters. Because you have a fax, you can run a number of support ships with your caps, such as Bhaalgorns and bonused web strength vindicators.
---
An alternative of course is blap dreads. If you can use mutaplasmids to roll yourself a strong web that gets 96-99% on a vindi, you use that along with XL fit dreads and a fax to blap subcaps, mind you this works best in a brawl, and people who can jam or outrun your vindi will be safe from your XL guns.
---
Of course the simplest one is probably just a fax and as many carriers as you can manage, coordinating vollies and pulling afterwards to keep your fighters safe.
---
Hope this was helpful.

much as i don't respect their posting, i do respect init's leadership for their shrewd political navigations - being a cfc alliance that really didn't have that hard of a time during wwb is on it's own something to be proud of, but being long-time neutral friends with snuff and never having snuff get the better of them (afaik) is also pretty impressive
---
snuff are sneaky bitches particularly since hy took over
---
This is not an easy question to answer. Think about the kind of threats you will be facing, and the skills of your pilots. A home defense comp is great to have, but a home defense comp that you never practice is a comp where you will make tons of mistakes at the critical moments. Also, your local weather matters a lot!
---
If you want a recent example of a small number of pilots in capitals defending their hole against larger numbers in subcaps, look at Indigo Generation. They were in a C6 though.
---
No, his call to nerf cloaky camping is in response to there being talks about nerfing cynos. OP doesn't want cloaking campers to get missed in a balance pass.
---
The problem is that cloaky campers aren't a problem. He's trying to fix something that can already be fixed 3 or 4 different ways, it just requires some effort on his part. He's trying to convince the community to get CCP to change a game mechanic because he's too lazy to watch his screen when ratting/mining.
---
Fit for pvp and a single cloaky camper can't kill you, or cant kill you fast enough before a response fleet arrives.
---
Align out and you can warp before someone can lock you.
---
Don't rat while a neut is is system and you never get caught.
---
Go to a different system and you wont have a neut in local making you feel uncomfortable.
---
Set bait traps to discourage cloaky campers going for you.
---
Krab in a ship you can afford to lose once in a while and you can still make a profit.
---
Fit a cyno and you have backup a moment away (lots of people doing this under the current system).
---
This is not about game balance. This is about OP being a lazy chicken-shit.
---
Can someone repost here for those of us blocked on social medias at work?
---
I used to be in TSOE.  Coms had about 3 people in it, mostly calling you an idiot and/or telling you to join the permanent AYY gate camp to prevent bads getting into the pocket.
---
On the other hand Ransome, like me, should have learned an awful lot about keeping his shit alive just from living in Provi.  I'm surprised he did this.
---
trumps more competent
---
If you standing towards the pirates is too low you will not be able to run their missions.
---
Also if your standing is low enough, the response fleets to their mining operations will shoot you on site.
---
If it is high you can run their missions and use their LP stores, and their response fleets might help you.
---
&gt;we arent like out to get you or smthing but we arent also gonna not killu without any prior agreements sorry dude
---
chaotic neutral - might save your life, might steal your car
---
That's what Double Damage are doing for Rebel Galaxy Outlaw, a full photoshop-style application built into the game.
---
I imagine someone would be desperate enough if some of these cracked out girls can get johns you can too
---
no. 
---
I would be extremely surprised if they brought it back 
---
Yep. Fight a dramiel in a punisher? Sure, why not? And then I explode. 
---
I also tend to go in to a plex where I could easily die. Coercer and atron in a plex? I'll take that solo
---
u can actually mute everyone INCLUDING the fc
---
shut the fuck up
---
You are defending injectors by hiding behind "CCP wants profit". It's like some variation of tragedy of the commons.
---
&gt;So I assume it's a risk/reward thing? 
---
This is the idea. I live in, and lead a small corporation that lives in, wormhole space. If you play smart, make good in-game  connections and have the balls to fly in j-space (wormhole space) you can relatively easily plex (one month omega time) an account with isk to spare and then some. Do I advise it? Fuck no. Play the game to play the game, dont play the game to pay for the game. That's like having a second job, only your second job pays about 50 cents American per day. Jesus Christ man, just get a real second job at that point.

In terms of the actions of your leadership, they were clearly looking for an opportunity to do just that.  They didn't have a ferox and logi cache ready to hand out for no reason.

True lol but definitely worth muting everyone else at least. I haven't been in incursions for a long time though tbh so it could be better now

You rock, much appreciated.

Good to know there are not just Bros in new eden. But fookin' super duper bros too.
---
Haha good point. In other games I've been able to easily afford membership through gameplay alone while still leaving enough funds for other activities so that's why I ask.
---
So regarding your corporation.. does it have a base somewhere in the universe then? And people can attack it, destroy it and take all the loot from it? If so, then I assume that having a base itself gives you perks and the more you customize the base the more perks you get? If your base is destroyed, do you have to start from scratch again?
---
Btw, how much does one month omega cost? In usd?

&gt; The Thrill of Fleeting up with Thousands of Fellow Pilots...
---
You can keep that "thrill".
---
Report them with the ingame tool bro. Posting on reddit just gets you karma, dosnt get these dudes banned.
---
I like how your test is... attempted to convo them and they didn’t wanna talk to me so obviously must be bots. 
---
How do i do that, I must be missing it somewhere.  I tried to right click their names and it only says report isk spammer.  and i tried the help keys and theres only report bugs there.
---
are you about to take the longest and shortest warp of all time in eve online?
---
Holy FUCK that is cancer lmao. I remember a corp I was in did that, it had to be either SLYCE or B0T I forget which. Needless to say I didn't stick around lol
---
They weren't micro transactions, summer of rage started because of the pricing structure. $40 jeans, $120 monocles.. 
---
The eve player base had a cow and just said we hate it because of its intention. 
---
And ccp could online a date when we would actually be able to walk in station not just our own cabin...
---
When you battlecruiser to 5 so they give you each races to 5 instantly.  Feelsgoodman
---
Well I ganked one too.  And threatened to keep ganking.  Nothing at all.
---
Well, it's actually a 7 hour evening shift, then 10 hours of "stay-and-sleep-at-work-in-case-of-emergency-and-get-paid-for-it" followed by another 7 hours morning shift. We get one such deal per week.
---
Lol look here, this picture has the word LOKI in it, like the cruiser? geddit?
---
You don't remember the pricing structure for that cosmetic crap? Or the fact you couldn't show off that cosmetic crap? 
---
The player base reacted the only way they could with the silly direction ccp had started with. Walking in stations should be primarily for social interaction and for blowing people's face off. Cosmetics should have come secondary to that, it didn't.
---
Which is funny, since this video really was more substance than just a flashy, loud trailer trying to lure people in like clickbait links.
---
The FC can tell someone else to do things. 
---
Shoulda had the explosive DD on there and moused over it and blown up the tooltip so everyone watching was in awe of the gjjjjjjalalalalalahorn.
---
things didn´t stay vanity only though and they wouldn´t have with or without WiS. 
---
look im asking for whats realistic here.  cat ears are realistic.  dino suit is wildest dreams level shit.
---
Ransoming, ganking and scamming are pretty damn lucrative.

Drop marines to stop citadel defenses being fired and get loot from corp hanger....

sometimes you get rewarded for those kind of ballsy shit

a few weeks ago i went "yolo" and jumped into hecate and catalyst in a hawk and ended up killing both because both thought Null is for nerds and only brought truckloads of void 
---
just wait, furries are willing to pay alot of money for suit related nonsense 
---
Are you implying that Donnie had been any more honourable? 
---
Because I was assured that Snuff's reputation for backstabbing does not come from one direct blue awox, one indirect agreement awox and now one assummed but not actually implied agreement non-awox... 
---
I was told the reputation stemms from Snuff of long ago and since I had only been with Snuff since tge end of WWB - my opinion on Snuff's reputation is not valid.

Someone crossed a loot pinata with one of those russian dolls.  This loot pinata was filled with smaller loot pinatas.

Thank you for sharing. May your journey be painless.

Have been reported a similar crew in Stayme for a few months they get sick of me bumping then move to the other side of the map
---
If nothing else cloaky campers make me not want to play. I PVE in between PVP fleets. If I cant PVE, what am I going to do, sit and ship spin? Nope, there are other games to play. This is surely bad for the game? I cant be the only one who just logs off if there is still a camper in system (and all of the others)? 
---
Game already dead. When your large nullsec blocks go on "content" fleets most of the time. Whatever happened to just killing alliances.deas and forcing them to disband ? All people want to do now is shoot citadel that are 1/20th the value of their fleet.deployed to collect a.crap 20 bill km. And lose 400 bill in the process.
---
And a ton of skins mistakenly valued at .01 isk, not to mention undervalued researched BPOs.  Looking at closer to 500B just eyeballing it.
---
If you are drunk how will you remember to hit clone bay before bridge? What happens if you bridge first then clone bay after landing on enemy fleet
---
Yeah explaining a concept is defending it right? What are you 12?
---
Oh god, it hurts. So if you actually compare the fits, and account for the fact they are shooting antimatter at each other, and overheat your modules (Like you do when you get called primary). NC ferox has 169k ehp, TEST ferox has 111k ehp. 
---
All in the same house of course!
---
You should see T3C.
---
Guaranteed cost per engagement is not the same as one-time cost up front.
---
You can counter wormholes before enemy contact by rolling them.  You can't be super blobbed by wormholes.
---
You can't shoot every cyno before being blobbed.
---
None of what you said was correct or appropriate.  Sorry.
---
To answer the first, I would roll an alpha, get a few ships asploded and see if you think you'll even like the game, then pay for omega and see what your first month looks like. 
---
We do have a base....and it is precisely what you could refer to as "somewhere in the universe". Our system connection to both known space and other wormhole systems is variable,  so my Corp can kinda pop up anywhere, sorta like a boner at church or at school, and likely every bit as awkward to witness. People can attack my stations and they can loot my shit if they can root me and my homies out of our cellar, but I can do the same to their shit. Yes to all of the above regarding base perks and advantages. Yes to if it goes pop. 
---
One month is 14.99 I believe, then you can get a deal for 3 months or a year.

I'll admit, if he announces that they took their FPS team and put em to work on WIS 2.0
---
... *I'll clap*
---
In the evepraisal aren't any skins with .01 isk.. These are all valued higher than that.
---
Only the Blueprint copies aren't valued and the other stuff which can't be sold in the market.
---
But yes, researched BP are valued higher than their market price ;)
---
But as long as the killmail API isn't able to show the research levels, we have to value them as a fresh bought blueprint.
---
Okay
---
If you have an armor rag with a shield tank slapped on extra, your minokawas apply exactly the same amount of repping power to it. So if it survived the DD volley, it lives. 
---
Heck, in hull timer in X47 we had shield tanks on erebuses and minokawas ended up saving the second one to get primaried. 
---
quality if this photo seems amazing. I play on max setting 1980x1020 but I don't remember New Eden being this beautiful. I've been docked for the last few months so my memory might be off.
---
Who would have thought: it figures?
---
Meanwhile "CaptainWoodstock" is known as over New Eden for his, uh, um, something.
---
Thats for CCP to decide I guess.  I am just reporting what I believe to be the case.
---
You could "justify" so much bad by saying "its a business" that its truly irrelevant.

What is the point? You wanna keep everything as it is because is a business?

i got kicked from evictus in provi for losing a retriever when all my corp just up and warped off and i didnt notice.
---
then they collapsed, just like these fuckers will
---
I think those of us in null forget that these ships are end game ships for high-sec as well, so they will always carry a higher price tag than entry-level capital ships.

Your titan also got killed by them for being retarded.

Can confirm. Source: Three goon dreads and a battle rorqual dropped into Esoteria yesterday with no further support. It went about as well as it would have in Delve.
---
I probably hold game records for biggest hauls on 3-4 types of trash tier jita scams. It gives me a lot of satisfaction to know I'm #1 at something, even if it's something rubbish. 
---
Awesome and sick!
---
I know others have already answered by I will keep adding stuff
---
&gt; Is the entirity of the eve world a pvp zone? The narrator mentioned you could focus on mining, but also be a space pirate so.. can someone theoretically come in, destroy my ship and take my work of mining for an hour in the span of 2 minutes?
---
With the exception of abyssal space (which is a time limited thing), you will encounter players that will want to kill you. They might die in the process, but if someone want to kill you, they can. That being said, you're not alone, and in some area of space you can live surrounded by friends and people who will defend you from enemies wanting to kill you.
---
Another important point, if you die say mining, you will loose your cargo but also your ship. Which generally is worth more than the result of your hourly farm session. One important rule for Eve is never fly what you can't afford to loose.
---
Yes, although some modules loot from your wreck, you will loose your ship. You can insure your ships, which at an initial cost gives you money if you loose your ship, but it doesn't pay for all your ship back. It's important to understand that ships in Eve are like ammunition. There are some more valuable than others, but you should not be afraid to loose them.
---
&gt; How exactly do microtransactions work ? 
---
You can buy a currency called PLEX with RL money. With PLEX you can buy subscription time, Mmulti character training, skill extractors (so you can sell skill points with IG money), and skins.
---
&gt; I heard that a year or so ago, there was a massive all out war that costed thousands of dollars of damage on both sides. So how exactly was this quantified?
---
You can trade PLEX for isk (isk being IG money). Simple math from that. If 20€ is 500PLEX, and 1 PLEX sells for 3M isk, you can convert the assumed loss in isk to RL money.
---
It's not growing, it's slowly declining. Which, for a 15 year old game, is fine.
---
If you're looking for more info/advice about Eve, [here is the message I generally give to new comers](https://www.reddit.com/r/evenewbies/comments/9qk6pa/just_downloaded_the_client/e8adskd/).
---
I don't think a private server for EVE would ever be viable, the cost to run the EVE server cluster is astronomical and requires hundreds of systems, anything less than that you have a game that doesn't have the critical mass to be called "EVE".
---
Not to mention the temptation to cheat for "your side" from the people running it would be extreme, and have out-sized effects compared to somebody getting admin-twinked up to endgame gear by a WoW shard admin. This has already been a problem with a for profit company running the show, it would be a constant disaster for a community run server.

The tracking doesn't need to be nerfed bc trig ship need it to apply effectively at the velocity they can move, and for fighting at range, i.e Kiki/drek. Then with Sheks, Ved's from my experiences is that they fair better in a brawling situation. The other night my Corp, and I had Kiki's out, and they were deleted by a Gila, and omen np. The Kiki needs the tracking ability to fight at range, and to keep the ramp up. It will get murdered, and not used if not for it's tracking. These bonuses don't make up for a pilot whom isn't up to snuff via manually piloting, but it does give all pilots the opportunity to fight outclassed, and outnumbered. Which myself, and pilots whom fly trig ships mostly are interested in. It's the ability to fight without being a apart of a major blue doughnut, or rather be effective without needed X number of people to make a comp work how an fc wants it to work.

Just join a new wormhole Corp then you don’t have to worry about local. I hear stranger danger is recruiting
---
Restrict injectors to sub cap training only.  Yeah I said it, roast me!
---
So there are a couple different “bases” you can have in the game. The guy above said he lives in wormhole space, so that means that his solar system has constantly changing connections to other wormholes and known (normal) space. In wormholes, there is no premade NPC places to dock or keep items, so you need your own station. Players can attack and destroy said station assuming they can manage to fight their way through and attack it long enough. Wormhole space is also special because all assets in the base are dropped, as opposed to only some in known space (it’s a little complicated, it’s called asset safety if you want to look it up). This makes wormholes more dangerous, but this is compensated for by having the best money-making opportunities in the game, and making you a badass.
---
If you really want CODE brought down, the best thing to do is teach newbies safe mining and hauling practices. CODE preaches that stuff (and other things), but really their entertainment relies on a steady stream of new/lazy players who ignore good practice. If everyone actually followed the CODE, there'd be nobody for CODE to gank.
---
My alliance has the same rule and i'm finde with it.
---
Horde Ferox does have less (cap booster for beans with bad skills), making it even stupider that TEST (from what I heard) was shooting NC first.
---
I did something like this once in my (pre-Rorqual mining) nullsec renter days. I volunteered as project manager for our small corp and set up the goal of building a carrier. The idea was to buy back ore from all the corp mates at 90% Jita buy, then build the cap parts and assemble them into a finished product to take to market. The profit would be calculated as the sale price minus ore costs and fees, and it would be split proportionally among all the miners by amount contributed.
---
Before I began, I worked out exactly what kinds and quantities of ore we would need to end up with the right ratio of minerals for the build. Every time somebody contributed ore I would enter it into a spreadsheet so I could send out a corp mail showing our progress to target and what kind of ore we still needed.
---
The project was good because it provided the miners with structure, order and guidance. Instead of exporting ore to Jita, they realized they could earn more by mining the target ores quickly and selling straight to the corp. It was a good lesson in delayed gratification, and I gained some leadership experience.
---
Something like this might help to draw your corp members together. Instead of a carrier, you could make your goal an Orca.
---
There is nothing more soul-crushing than mining for the sake of mining, especially in a dull place like highsec. It's about the least creative way to earn ISK. The fun in EVE is using teamwork to achieve goals and overcome challenges. If you ever feel like you've stopped learning new things it's time to move onward and upward.
---
Sometime ago i read a people saying the efective Yield of a fitted rorqual as 18400 m3 by minute.  Yesterday i catch a conversation in null about that for a multiboxer saying the efective yield is around 13500 m3 per minute, for him, when t2 is colocated and already kissing the rock.
---
Anyone can tell what is the real yield for a optimal and by a decent t2 rorqual non perfect ? 
---
Regards.
---
My alliance has a point system. After the third lost ratting carrier with anything bigger than T2 fitted you are forbidden to rat with a carrier for some time.
---
HIGHER ON THE STREET
---
Shoot the drones, be faster than the drones, be tankier so it doesn't matter? You have less damage and utility to apply to the enemy ship by turning your attention to the damage he can do... exactly like is the case with every other form of lowering enemy damage, whether it's ecm or tracking disruption or cap warfare or speed tanking or whatever else.
---
see u there fam
---
))
---
I think Eve is on mega hard mode if your trying to play solo. I always recomend new players to join Brave and have a safe home for a while to 'get good'. Then go do you.
---
So we lost a whole new dimension of potential gameplay for no reason?
---
Yay
---
Actually i stand corrected,  the evepraisal doesn't even include a number of skins (search spirit skins for an example).
---
Your input was probably truncated due to length.
---
That's even more impressive imo.
---
When I lived in HS for a few months, I made most of my money with DED sites in Heimatar. My alt scanned all the sigs and did the datasites, if a combat site was found, the main ran it. But I also did other things from time to time, because everything gets boring after a while. A bit of mission running, some daytrips to LS and wormholes, exploration in Null, also some Abyss sites when they came out.
---
You should optimize your fun per hour, not your ISK per hour. Try different activities yourself and do what you like the most. 
---
If you are really only concerned about making as much money as possible, then your self restriction to highsec is out of place. Null is much better for turbokrabbing.
---
It’s a triglaiving triglavian
---
I guess it's official then that the chat system is so broken that CCP won't even bother to try to show the window in the official gameplay trailer. :)
---
CODE gets billions in regular donations from the nullsec entities who recruit the miners and industrialists CODE drives out of highsec. You're up against years of player effort and tradition here.
---
Best tactic against CODE is to starve them of easy targets by teaching new/lazy players good practices (like staying aligned while mining and not going AFK). You could even start up your own dirt-cheap hauling service to move their stuff around for them and it'd still be more money than you'd make trying to infiltrate CODE.
---
CODE would probably crow victory if all players started following good practice, but the reality is they'd be bored to tears and switch back grumbling to their cloaky Titan alts sitting on gates in Delve 23/7.

Unless you are talking about some shitfuck fit like this:

what if when you entosis a super it starts a 24 hour timer that spawns entosis nodes throughout the constellation and you have to get more than anyone else to get a pop-up that asks you if you want to blow it up or teleport it to Asset Safety 
---
This is cringy. You basically just linked a pastebin of yourself whining that you thought their neutral status meant 'blue.'

Yeah I agree its kinda irritating to have to scroll through the overview 
---
&gt; While most of us can laugh off random 100m losses, it really hurts other players.
---
His first KB entry is in 2010. Assuming he didn't buy the character, this loss shouldn't be that big a deal for a nine year old character.
---
I think he said "shut the fuck up", but I would also agree though. I would rather just buy some PLEX and sell it because I am a lazy asshole hahahaha
---
The campaign doesn't start till *next* saturday, anything before doesn't count. 
---
Yeah so, NC and Horde were not flying the same fit. Go look at the NC fit. Horde is setup to deal with lowskill noobs, so yes obviously their fits won't be as solid.
---
I still use The Butterfly Effect trailer to intro people and its 9 years old. I think the OP is being fair
---
Interesting, I'm surprised the ripped it out but hey I'm no professional developer.

If that's the case I doubt its worth the development time to reintegrate or redevelop it. A shame but probably a kindness for future development.

How the fuck do you counter a bunch of nerds in their invincible WH rage-rolling into your system?

Logi stops you from popping the links, and the links make it harder to alpha the feroxes. Of course we had enough numbers to kill the logi anyway, which made the links easier, which let us alpha feroxes as fast as we could lock them.
---
Careful with your rage-boner there, champ.
---
Wow, that trailer made me want to take a nap. I can't remember a more boring ad.
---
They should have just recycled or updated This is Eve or the butterfly effect ads.
---
Best time to play eve is the stage you are at
---
It certainly did seem like development focuses were weighted quite heavily on WiS but as we aren't internal we can't really know. 
---
That said I can kind of understand it from an investment point of view. If it had been a success, both technologically and reception wise it would have been a strong demonstration of new tech. It could have opened the doors to all kinds of new gameplay including immersion in the lore. 
---
Alas, what could have been was not. Let's hope they've learnt from their mistakes. 
---
Looks like shaggy was in jita, nothin you could do bud
---
This was honestly one of the best trailers they've put together, it explains the game better then the tutorial does too, which is kinda funny
---
To CCP Marketing team, real props for stepping up in the video department this last  year, significant improvements to some of the video marketing compared to what you were producing the few years prior, (the last videos of note being "this is eve" and dominion trailer) 
---
His killboard speaks for itself
---
In HS?
---
Evictus is pretty much alive.... And that stupid rule doen't exist anymore
---
What is the reason for using default, and nearly unusable, overview?
---
I get that it's what a prospective player will first see but why not show off the capabilities of the overview?
---
I lost JDC 5... twice... I quit after each time.
---
&gt; There are people in the Target demographic for this game who were literally not born when it came out.
---
They need to be excited to join even more. This would be a great Welcome to the game vid during NPE or an email after the account is created.
---
Ah the old 'ive run out of bullshit to spout and cannot response with logic anymore'
---
Got some more logical fallacies hiding in there?  
---
It would cost a carrier like 30m to launch all their fighters.  All this would do is kill carrier PVE.  It already costs 7m-10m isk to max jump, so its not like its a big deal for real combat.
---
Not really having to worry about ISK. I’ve gotten to the point recently where, say, FC went “hey guys we’re gonna use machariels today”, and I can drop 600m on a fitted one without blinking an eye. Ofc it’s not the same as dropping money on caps or supers, but I like not having to worry about subcaps :D
---
Escapes are my big personal victories.
---
Warping out of a deadspace pocket the exact moment that flashy frigate appears on grid (because you know they're carrying a cyno to warp in 12 friends in blops ships).
---
Or dodging a gank attempt on a wormhole relic site because the attacker 1) forgot to get close enough to keep you from cloaking or 2) let you burn out of scram range afterward.
---
Sweetest moments ever.
---
Move to null sec
---
Yeah i was hoping for an explanation lol but oh well. But yeah doing anything in eve for isk that feels like work would be better served doing actual work for isk
---
i played beta so got you all beat
---
That's actually pretty clever. Watching trailers even makes me want to ungroup my guns and show passive models, but actually doing it is just crazy.
---
There is mortal online, but that requires you to play mortal online.
---
I'm pretty sure CCP has (repeatedly) demonstrated over the past couple years that they don't have a QA department.
---
Otherwise, there's no excuse how they can launch event after event where the CORE PART OF THE EVENT is not working/uncompletable.  It would literally take 1 dude running the thing once to catch a lot of the issues that go live.
---
At least marketing isn't useless now right? They've been pushing out some stellar videos recently, I'm very impressed
---
Yeah I feel like he would have had more success with

I don't know you, never heard of you, but I'm glad things got better for you in life man, at the end of the day we are all people and sometimes need a bit of help.

If I had a time machine it would be a cointoss on what I would do first; go back in time to stop Hitler, or punch your daddy in the dick just before he banged your mom.
---
&gt; buy PLEX for ISK.
---
the best way to feel enslaved like an employee that has to grind to pay his basic living. 
---
Yeah, I liked this one too. I see where the folks who say they miss the flashy trailers are coming from, but I think that both those and a video like this have a place. This one certainly seems like it'd appeal to the people who get into an MMO for the long haul, for the persistence and relationships and world building and character development... and he flashy ones moreso for the people who want action and drama, etc.
---
I couldn't agree more about missed opportunities. In that whole video, not one reference was made in regards to wormholes. One of the most intriguing, mysterious places in all of New Eden. A place riddled with risks where one can explore and discover great rewards. It's a shame they really don't seem to care about "J-space".
---
Of course, I'm bisassed...wormholer btw.
---
&gt; people think that all capitals should be easy to kill in 1 VS 1 in a frigate.
---
**straw man** 🤦
---
Yet valve charges $40 for dota sets, and everyone loves them (Not referring to the various crate gambling controversies) 
---
Who/what was PIZZA? One of my corpies briefly mentioned it before going afk, he said he was part of it and described it as being a "space terrorist".
---
Any competent FC will tell you the same.
---
It's just 100% less fun than it used to be.
---
For big fleets, for medium fleets, for small gang, for solo, for anyone trying to do anything in hostile space.
---
It's just promotes the gameplay of miners and risk averse carebears.
---
Had this happen to me a dozen times. Also sometimes models load in, but overview+brackets don't. Re-logging always fixes it. Docking and un-docking *sometimes* fixes it.
---
Anybody know what causes this, or a quicker fix than re-logging?
---
Depends on where you live, in most northern atlantic countries your RL ISK/hour is higher (2-3 times for me) than Boson-HAW Ratting. So I would never grind ingame if its no fun. But for someone in an eastern european country or somwhere in the so called 3rd world, a Rorqual farm that nets you 3-5 Bil ISK per hour can finance a pretty good RL income. This is where, sadly, RMT and botting comes around.
---
It's only cheating if you get caught
---
Besides just jumping into a ship and flying into low sec/null, any advice on solo PVP roaming? I was thinking of trying to roam around in a stabber or caracal and just look for juicy targets and get blown up. I want to do the type of stuff Suitonia does.
---
His secret stuff for posting is revealed!!
---
\- Built my own Dreadnought out of trashloot.
---
\- Technically started a relatively successful corporation.
---
\- I'm somewhat "rich"... at least compared to when I was still living in 0.0.
---
intellectual discourse level of PISsers
---
What? You mean you don't personally have a couple dozen ferox stashed away in each of the major trade-hubs just in case you get involved in a grindy war of attrition with another null-sec power-bloc? 
---
Have you thought about maybe putting more time into writing your posts and having someone else look at what you wrote so they then could delete it for the common good of mankind? Just asking.
---
&gt;ppl that combat probe don't need to take gates, they can directly warp into your pocket on top of you.  
---
Is this true? I thought if you combat probed a DED site (escalated or scanned), it will always take you to the warp in regardless of probe location.
---
Occasionally they do camp gates/stations. It's actually super gay... Insta-lock scram web frigates, with a couple thousand DPS right behind them 
---
Tell advertising to show DD effects so they have to upgrade the visuals of the Rag/Levi doomsdays :v
---
Every solo kill I get is a victory/accomplishment for me and where I get real satisfaction from the game. I've played since 2011 but never really put much time into truly improving my solo game. I've flown a ton of small gang, been in huge blobs, FCd in wormholes, etc etc but only very recently taken up truly solo gameplay in addition to participating in alliance fleets. 
---
I get blobbed a lot. I get memed by recons on gates. I get rorquals and dreads dropped on my HFI by Snuff. But I always just wave in local and have a good natured chat with the guys that kill me. They're playing their game and I'm playing mine - and that's cool. It also means, when I do get that solo kill against often unfair odds, it's super satisfying. 
---
1 yes
---
2 yes dont matter where are u
---
3 my tip is purchase the extractor in permieter tranquility towe, and ell there . no need go to jita but your extractor must be in the same \`station/citadel of your seller ( can be an alpha )
---
4 yes
---
5 yes
---
6 in the location of your extractor
---
and dinos
---
So you asked snuff, who was *neutral*, if they were going to attack you, then you were surprised when they did.
---
You were surprised that snuff, who is known for betraying friendlies for easy super kills, would attack you while you were neutral to them.
---
Vily, I'm afraid you have terminal dinobrain.
---
Been playing for a long time always in ns.  recently created a new toon and after tutorial and career agents i feel like i have nothing to do besides learning skills. 
---
What rookie activities do you guys think are fun to do as a recently created alpha?
---
Go easy on the poor guy. He sometimes forgets that not all neutrals are actually secretly blues.
---
As a new player how do I get over my fear of leaving null sec and pvping?
---
small alliances like them do that rule as it prevents losses from wardecs, making it so people are less likely to do such. I know where he is coming from with that rule, as being in alliances without that rule vs with it is very different, as without i never seen a day without wardec, but the alliance with that in place, had maybe 1 every other month or so. Hate it all you want, but that rule helps prevent the wardecs you are loosing your snakes and vni's to, making it so you are able to make isk not loose it.
---
Fucking hell dude you just did the r/EVE equivalent of a faceplant..
---
You have a link to prove your confident statement?
---
Oh yeah, that's a great feeling. Was hacking a relic site yesterday and had a sabre land near my astero and just managed to escape. 
---
Ah, thanks!
---
That's good to know, so I can use the sp of my 0.0 main and my seller who is already parked in Jita without having to fly around at all. 
---
That's very convenient.
---
vily please, stop trying to portray this as a tainted dunk. you're neutral to snuff, they've killed tapi supers already on this campaign, and when you asked hy directly he denied nothing and POINTED BEHIND YOU SAYING LOOK OVER THERE WHAT'S THAT
---
you rused yourself and fed supers, and frankly it could have been a lot worse 
---
Corpmate was in PL Nyx back then and my corp was hunting Supers with the Aridia guys so we kept track of Super Kills
---
The fact you don't know what a logical fallacy is notwithstanding, it would logically counter dropping a blob of carriers or supers on T1 gangs.  It probably wouldn't, but who cares?  If your enemy wants to spend 300 million to kill 35 million worth of ships, happily let them.  Numbers are hard sometimes, but you can do it buddy!
---
It's fine if you want to go all autist defending your super blob pudding there.  No one says you aren't entitled to your opinion.  But my argument isn't about the meta.  It's the blob.  It's the blob used with impunity.  It's the blob breaking the game for the majority of people in the game.  Notice how there's only a fraction of logged in pilots as compared to right before pre-super blobs (and maybe a year after as it hadn't completely eradicated all play yet)?  2009-2011 was the height of logged in numbers in terms of consistency.  It was also the span of time the big coalitions were reaching insane numbers.
---
But, if you leave a game broken long enough, people leave.  2010 I remember signing in during my TZ peak to anywhere from 30k-40k people.  Randomly you'd see a 50k spike during big events or crazy engagements.
---
Now there are days during peak where there's less than 20k logged in.  22k is a good day.
---
But you can keep shitting on ideas that would, logically, thin out the use of the game-breaking mechanic.  You can explain it away that "everyone else could be doing it so it's their fault, not the people using the blob".  Keep explaining it away until the servers go offline, champ.  You'll still be sitting there frantically servicing your pro-blob rant boner finding some other game to pro-dominationonesideslantedadvantage
---
The problem isn't a blob.
---
The problem is an unchecked game mechanic went on for so long and contributed to the degradation of the game itself.  Logged in player count hasn't been this bad in my TZ peak since before 2008.  People who used to be anti-carebear are now doing nothing but because they love the game so much they'd rather do something than give it up, and would rather not sit around praying for an actual sub fight instead of watching cyno camper after cyno camper, with the nearest camp or roam two regions away at best.
---
But keep up your crusade, man.  Sounds like you're doing a stellar job.
---
[https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/](https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/)
---
This makes no sense to me and seems inefficient and illogical . Maybe I’m missing something, but why would spend rl money on an extractor to lessen the sp on your main in order to omega sub your main. Why not just spend rl money on a subscription?
---
they died
---
At current rates 10$ = just about 750mil isk really. 
---
Because I only need a single extractor to start the process (because I don't have the cash to buy one). And buying a single extractor with RL cash is way cheaper than a month of omega.
---
That would be rage inducing, I hated training it once.
---
Blow up the mtu. Watch the boot freakout.
---
this
---
Most combat sites are in deadspace so you will land on the acceleration gate.
---
Serpentis 6/10 for some reason is not in deadspace.
---
Htfu dude
---
&gt;I would counter that it is not close, in that you had control over *quality* of items in SWG
---
EvE's system is closer than other MMOs because the stuff you craft is actually relevant and useful to the game.  But SWG let you actually be *good* at crafting, and thus produce something better than others.
---
every time i win a fight with a ship people call shit is a victory for me.
---
The height of my eve career was probably the time i solo killed a vagabond in an AB retribution in catch. Close second would be a solo kill of a loki with a tormentor in faction warfare.
---
do you know what pun means
---
Oh. I could google it I guess, but since we are already having a convo and you know the answer, out of curiosity what is the rl price of one extractor?
---
Multi warp drifting 
---
They stated when alpha clones came out it was bannable to multibox them or to use virtual machines to circumvent the restriction of only one account logged in at a time if it was an alpha.
---
Most combat sites are in deadspace and you will land on the gate.
---
Serpentis Logistical Outpost part 2 is not in deadspace so no limits.  
---
Colony Under Fire is another Serpentis one not in deadspace. Not sure if other factions have this kind of things too.
---
Especially snow crab, they are sooooo good
---
The more you know.... Thanks!
---
Please biomass
---
I played earth and beyond so i got you beat. 
---
So in SWG the randomness was only in the stats of the raw materials.  For example, the specific copper ore that spawned one week was way more conductive than last week's copper ore.
---
Then the crafter combined the variety of raw materials they had into gear, removing the randomness if desired.  For example, conductivity in one part controlled the damage of weapons.  So save up that high-conductivity copper for that part, use junk for other parts.
---
The result was instead of random rolls, a good crafter consistently made good gear.
---
It depended on a number of third party libraries (which is really common). Which were, for example, 32 bit only, and relatively old.
---
Updating everything would have been a lot more work than people might think, as with a 'dead' feature, it was somewhat backburnered for maintenance. 
---
(Please note, I'm making assumptions and inferences here. I may be wrong)
---
Dat 1024 x 768 resolution.
---
AND I KNOW IT’S MY PLACE TO GO 
---
Comet is more than capable of killing a Dramiel in most situations. Maybe cut T1 frig fights though, unless it's multiple vs you.
---
5,50€ on the official store - not sure if there are cheaper alternatives
---
what am i looking at here?
---
Myspace, Napster, Bearshare.
---
There's a reason that groups like Test and Goons are as successful as they are. They'll point and laugh when it's warranted but the shit from OP doesn't happen.
---
\-T4, higher potential income, higher risk, short term money making
---
\-incursion, stable income, boring like hell, needs a bit of time investment when starting, needs time investment when moving to next incursion
---
use your imagination you can make money with allmost every thing you can  do in eve.
---
 some basic  stuff would be .:
---
do Station tradeing ( buy cheap sell high)
---
do hauling  npc good´s (mission and/or tradegood)
---
do hauling player good´s
---
do mining (ore/moonore/ice/gas)
---
do missions
---
do incursions
---
do exploreing (hacking/ ded sites)
---
do planetary interactions
---
but most importend  if possible dont do it alone. it is more fun with friends , and if its just jokeing around and shitposting in fleet chat. (granted this does not bring money but it makes the game more worth its time)
---
Can confirm not enough salvagers/medium shield extenders
---
IAT, Falcon said the fits were designed so that the buttons looked pretty on the video.
---
Alright.  7:1.
---
Buy should of course say Sell.  You buy PLEX to sell to ISK, is what I meant.  Some people are ideologically opposed, which I totally understand.  
---
Here's the full list: [https://imgur.com/Ezjflg6](https://imgur.com/Ezjflg6)
---
I asked a Chinese corpie what the names say, the names are nothing fancy, they just say something like "Ishtar YC117 Special Edition". I also compared the stats, they aren't any different from their regular counterparts.
---
The "YC117 Special Edition" catalog encompasses: Ishtar, Dominix, Megathron, Raven, Apocalypse, Abaddon, Armageddon, Eagle
---
Out of all these, I find the Armageddon the fanciest, featuring blue wave motif on a black hull. The "pimpest" would probably be the Raven with its golden hull.
---
Why she was pretty cool and if i work up next to her there are a chance i got to spoon with bazman (if they still are together).
---
But i think the only ex corp mate i would not wake up next to are butterdog.
---
He has to fix chat first before he can move to something more advanced
---
I mean it is absolutely absurdly profitable, there is a neverending tide of retards 
---
You can absolutely get a taste for the game as a f2p. You can do some of the lower end pvp as well. It scales OK. Like an alpha can do faction warfare and fly something that can actually win pvp fights and earn enough ISKs (indirectly) to keep them in ships and maybe the occasional month of omega time.
---
I'm not sure where this is coming from Vily so I'll bite.
---
Snuff have been ganking your titans and supers as they moved to Oijanen. I'm not sure why you wouldn't know about it, but it's not exactly something that was on the down-low: [Levi](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73428042/), [Avatar](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73309879/), [Nyx](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73317716/) 
---
Maybe you felt that after the TRI gank things changed a bit, or even after the big dread whelps in Geminate, on which you worked together.
---
But you were cognizant of danger; you took precautions. You asked Hy if he had hostile intentions, and you still only moved your capitals 2-by-2. You were hoping for the best, but you prepared for the worst.
---
I refuse to accept that you didn't factor in your mind that they could attack you when everything points to the contrary.
---
So, if despite all that, you came out with this argument, I dunno man, the only conclusion I can draw is it's an emotional reaction to being disappointed (i.e. butthurt).
---
But seriously, if you guys expect people to act like blues, perhaps you should keep them blue and stop pretending the relationship is anything different.
---
&gt; Moneymaking
---
&gt; In highsec
---
There's your problem.
---
2013 solar bl dunk
---
&gt; no we dont and weve never had that relationship wtf you cant expect me to be like o ya we r going there to kill your supers , youre nuetral lol and I didnt say no when you asked or yes i just told u about the other timer. Youre neutral dude sorry
---
TEST NRSI confirmed
---
I have Sabres everywhere, not Feroxes.
---
Do you....do you think this makes you look _better_?
---
oh dear
---
My understanding is that they're original roots lie in 4chan, their core cadre was in TEST for a bit while TEST was young, and then they struck out on their own and founded PIZZA, basing themselves in PR- in NPC Delve.  
---
They had fun farming ratting Tengus using T1 Trashers, and provided great content.
---
Abyssals are far too risky at 4&amp;5. All it takes is getting dicked by CCP and their shitty constant d/c's once or a bullshit spawn and you'll probably never run another one again because it'll take you a month to recover the ISK lost just to break even... assuming of course that it doesn't happen to you a second time after spending another 5 Bill on another ship. So your -10B just in initial costs.
---
Incursions are predictable, relatively cheap to run even a blingy ship vs an Abyssal bling req'd for 4/5. 
---
Well CCP could easily make the Near2 software unusable by removing client logging of chat channels. Oh wait. I THINK I just solved the problem of all Intel tools.
---
holy shit if I had only known to just convo you before we do anything to check and see if you're gonna drop on me man that would have made things so much easier
---
lmao remember when ccp almost had a fix for multiboxing alphas and then never said anything about it again?
---
Yee HAW
---
Reminder: you can still, completely accidentally, discover how to multibox alphas because of how easy it is. 
---
&gt;  generally how these type of relationships work
---
first time working with snuff, huh?
---
Pretty good for a freestyle sketch.
---
Where's the 50MN MWD?
---
Technically any damage bonus increases damage to drones/fighters since 
---
you know
---
you can shoot them
---
I run a cycle of "Risk averse-ish" to "suicidal" and back. My best fight happen when I'm sort of in-between the two, leaning towards suicidal (because people are broadly incompetent.)
---
But when I know the other toon and how they fight I tend very risk averse especially when I know they fly my hard counter, I'm trying to change that though.
---
I feel like the plural of ferox should be ferox. Kinda like moose. 
---
Comparing those prices hides that inflation meant 40$ then not 40$ now. AND the subsequent years of priming gamers to be used to dlc/cosmetic packages. It’s been years, gee, wonder whats changed
---
_The secret stuff_
---
From reading your viewpoint on the summer of rage I feel that you fail to grasp what it was people were upset over, especially considering it from a modern perspective where things like f2p and microtransactions are commonplace and abused by other game companies frequently.
---
The reason people equated it to gold ammo is because gold ammo and even ships were mentioned in an internal CCP newsletter that was leaked to the community, though to be fair that wasn't supposed to eve be seen by the players.
---
Development has always been bad. Hell one of the factors behind the summer of rage was how much of a flop Incarna ended up being. Behind schedule and a buggy shitshow, it failed in almost every aspect at release. 
---
I did blow up the MTU. Then the orca began tractor beaming cans and looting them.
---
All of them bots
---
By fitting up 10-50 identical pre-approved ship fits and going out there in those cheap ships, accepting beforehand that you will lose all of them and just learn as you fly. Find some friends along the way, see where it leads you, and before you know it you'll be loving it. 
---
Hope you can sleep at night because you just made it in Soulfire's Eve's Most Wanted Black Book
---
What I usually do with these clueless rude spergs is to take them to my mental rape dungeon. Ill bullshit them about everything and anything under the sun 
---
I would trust your inferences more than most! Thanks for the info. 
---
The heat of that burn, it’s frightening :-).
---
You would think that after all these years they just can’t sell that to the people who actually fly these ships where it counts.
---
No no, let’s try your basic average shit fit. That’ll impress the punters!
---
CCP, come on guys. Make a damn effort already!
---
Maybe my math is off, but it looks like you're better off just subbing. Skill extractor price is currently $5.49 each. You're going to need three skill injectors to plex your account. 500 plex = 1,875,000,000 isk, but selling two skill injectors on the market will only net you around 1,735,000,000. Three extractors cost $16.50 (subbing cost $15).
---
But once I buy one extractor, I can then sell the resulting injector, use the ISK to buy another extractor and so on... ?
---
You must not have met Joe yet hua.
---
Another specific way to make isk is transporting encounter surveillance systems of all the factions to jita, the minmatar ones can have a doubling of value!
---
Nope. Better off with having them on cruiser hulls and above.
---
It's only from my perspective, but I've always been attracted to eve because of its pvp, so from the start I was slowly preparing myself for my failures at pvp, loosing ships but also learning. Plus from the start I've made my way of thinking that this is a game, so loosing ships is just a minor inconvenience. Sure, at first it was painful to loose a ship, especially with loot after getting back from a good nullsec exploration. It made me angry and frustrated, but I just kept going. And loosing all those ships kinda steeled me to the eventuality to pvp. Afterwards, when I decided to go for pvp full on, I just went into lowsec and started fighting in cheap t1 hulls. Plus what helped me a lot is that after having a fun solo fight in a rupture against a 4 man frigate gang, I got invited to their corp. And kinda fully opened the doors for me into pvp. Being in a group of fun and laid-back space loving nerds was the biggest motivation to learn and continue pew pew'ing to this day.
---
Drones and fighters have damage types as well
---
*whistles winds of change by the scorpions*
---
You got baited son.
---
Eve will run in a potato with some wires put into it, so im pretty sure you will be ok :)
---
I will say, Eve seems a lot more risky reading about it than once you actually start playing. 
---
Firstly, unless you live in a wormhole, all your stuff is 100% safe unless you undock it, even if the structure it is being stored in explodes, your stuff will be automatically moved to an invincible npc station nearby. You have to pay a fee to get it back, but it’s not nearly as bad as it sounds. 
---
Similarly, wormhole people usually keep the majority of their assets in either liquid form (isk), where it is perfectly safe, or in invincible npc stations, and only keep the stuff they think they’ll need soon in their wormhole system. That way, if their structures get blown up, it’s mostly just an inconvenience, not a death blow. 
---
Second, most people live in nullsec, and you’ll probably get recommendations saying to join a Corp there. While living in a space where anyone can attack you at any time sounds scary, there is a list of people in the same system as you that you can always see, along with their standings to you and your Corp/alliance. So, if you see someone with either no or bad standing come into your system, presumably to try to kill you, you can just warp off to a friendly structure. Some people will switch ships to something that looks like a pve ship but is really a pvp ship and go back to the place where they were earlier to bait out the enemy, but most just wait for them to pass by. 
---
And lastly, because ships are lost on death, you should never undock in something you can’t replace a couple times over. A typical pve ship will earn what it is worth pretty quickly, so odds are by the time you lose it you’ll still have made a net profit.
---
yes but its certainly not impressive or worthy of a video imo, its like showing a comet killing a rifter
---
Rent 3 movies less, and sub for a month. 🤔

This is SP farming, but usually you dont wreck your main to do so. People buy the best training implants, and set  level 5 skills, then when they have enough extract. So yes this exists, but unless you dont like flying all your things, i wouldnt extract all that much
---
Yo Sabin, long time no see!

You were an angry man but it's good to see you're doing well :)

2019 TYOOL and ccp still haven't made the default overview something other than pure trash.
---
They claim they want new players yet continue to leave basic shit conducive to keeping players alone for years on end.
---
Yes, but that is such a waste. Are you extracting skills that you never plan on using again?
---
Ganking TSOE impels

Thats pretty much it

Pure blind is a warzone at the moment, perhaps tgats a good place to start, just make sure to enter through lowsec and watch for camps, oldschool reaaaaaaaaly likes to camp.

Train towards a frig for doing some abyssals, you should be able to do the t1s solo (i think)

Haha, you should be in rl politics lol

Hmm I don't see it
---
Blaster corms are a cheap way to harvest salt by sniping cynos in hostile space. Even on their keepstar.
---
its hs just use neutral chars for linking/anchoring
---
To the top you go. Why make the barrier of entry for their FPS game higher when they could just have one account, one client, do everything. It would be a killer feature for an MMO.
---
All the sudden ? Marshals dropped down from 60b to almost 4b since the release of bpcs ... so there was always a big supply 
---
Private servers tend to be reimplemented from scratch though, it's not hard to make code run faster than CCP's legacy shit.
---
hint: there is a direct gameplay benefit to showing passive modules 
---
Massive, fundamental difference is that Dota is free to play and EVE was a subscription MMO.
---
I mean walking in station would have been totally awesome if you could have actually walked in the station and seen other players.  Walking in captain's quarters != walking in station.  
---
That's a pretty good idea, wouldn't have saved the logi but might have made it a bit tougher for us to kill the feroxes. There's only so much you can do without logi though.
---
yeah, they are useful, no doubt, but Overview packs do come with some problems when you consider newbs no nothing about the game and the overview.   
---
Hence, I would very much prefer a decent tutorial for how the overview works and how you can set one up for your individual needs.
---
Dinos don't have fur though
---
any reason why they didn't use footage of particularly busy Jita undocks? It all seemed somewhat tame and small from their shooting spot

you don't need a 5b ship to clear t4s, not even close lmao

If you think its easy to re-implement a server system as complex as what EVE online has, you have absolutely zero idea about programming and probably shouldn't talk about it.
---
Check prices, normally using a perimeter citadel is better.
---
*... I'll wait until next fanfest for him to change his mind*
---
how often does logi save someone in a game of alpha each other? ive never run the math but you might be better off just not to care about logi and put those guys in more dps in order to chew even faster through enemy dps.
---
They were charging similar amounts for TF2 hats before it went free to play, I didn't see anyone rioting.
---
Wew
---
We're all choobs down here 
---
I believe we had some success with logi, though we had an easier job of it because there was less alpha coming in from the TEST side, but it is tough when you're up against an alpha doctrine. Logi is also important to keep stuff like links alive, but if you're using neutral links that isn't an issue. I think tidi probably helped logi out because it gave primaries a lot more real-world time to broadcast between getting yellow boxed and red boxed, and logi a lot more time to react to the broadcast.
---
Someone could lend you that ISK, and you could pay it back once you extract enough. Even if you decide to go scam, it's just a price of one skill extractor. 
---
The explanation they gave when they tore it out was pretty much what you said. Keeping it updated with each patch was more work than was worth it considering to how many players actually used it.
---
You don't need guns in Jita. It's safe!
---
Glad you are having fun!
---
Try out the abyss too sometime soon!

what if the bot is going to fly anything omega required
---
you know like a nyx 
---
Loot fairy didn't just say yes. She got her hot sister and Mom involved too. Well played to the shooters. Best score I've seen in a while
---
I will echo the other comment. This is how people sp farm, but you don’t do it with your main. Honestly better to just come up with money for your sub.
---
You get a week to get your shit together and get on grid.

What would happen if a titan fleet started shooting these diamond rats? Would one be able to have a nice escalating X47 type fight for shits and giggles until DT?

I took over the corporation 'Sons of 0din' back in 2012 or so and had the best MMO experience and met a lot of my current friends doing it for many years. Eventually wound it down and now enjoy playing much more casually with my current corp but have so many awesome memories.
---
Shout out to old \[0DIN\] and \[FA\] members if you're out there.
---
Okay, thanks everyone for your replies. 
---
I will think about this again - at least now I better understand how injectors/extractors work. 
---
Now I have to get a handle on all my distributed ships/gear in hostile 0.0/lowsec. :/
---
Nullsec isn't safe, consider them NPC gankers. And you can look outside before undocking. 
---
I'd be fine with that.
---
I'm not opposed to removing access to stuff if people aren't active subscribers in a subscription based game.
---
Thanks for the legit answer! Makes sense now. :) 
---
This solves exactly nothing of what people are complaining about.  The complaints are against Omega players instantly skill-injecting into carriers and Rorquals, things Alphas can't use...
---
Yeah your disintegrator's offline
---
[https://zkillboard.com/kill/74886638/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/74886638/)

what's the problem here. bittervets complaining that they had to wait 10 years to fly a titan? or that people can pay-to-fly a ship they don't understand?
---
As an alpha player myself, I'd be fine with alphas only being allowed to use the daily alpha injector, personally
---
A LOT of people are in what we call a "long buying cycle" for EVE Online. They have heard stories, read news articles, maybe seen a video here or there. They know about the game and are interested, but don't have the push to get over major obstacles like "It's too hard" or "It costs a lot" or "I'll never catch up."
---
Content like this is for people who are still in that cycle. I guarantee it will be used in highly targeted pre-roll video advertising and remarketing banner campaigns for prospects just like this.
---
Jenquai Defender for Life!
---
KWG has some of the most notorious botting groups under its banner. Not surprising that CCP cracking down on bots is kicking them in the ass.
---
Very true yeah fair point I was being a bit ignorant there 
---
That was one of the interesting things that made harvesting in the game fun. Finding that super rich spawn that only lasted a week, trying to get as many of your harvesters on it before somebody else figured out it was there. 
---
And it was always interesting to top a rise and see a hundred massive harvester clanking up and down and wondering what good shit somebody happened upon. 
---
Neither. 
---
Before when a balance patch hit that had a buff like rorqs got it would take forever to see the market be effected significantly because anybody that now wanted to fly one and couldn’t before would need to wait nearly a year to fly and mine with one effectively. 
---
Now a days when that buff hit not only were new players able to inject into one in however fast it takes to actually apply the skills but established players exploited the fuck out of it and thus the fleets of a multiple multi boxed rorqs that aren’t uncommon in null sec today. 
---
This had a huge effect on the market and cascaded into the capital issue hurting the game so badly now that caps not only become easy to inject into but also super cheap as mineral prices fell thanks to the rorqs. 
---
The same thing to a degree happens with carriers and supers. But the huge offender since injectors came out that changed the game entirely were rorqs ever since their buff. 
---
Ha, Nice.

---
Five years into EVE and my first corp disbands. We were a really tight group of players, but we were all getting a bit sick of the game. It was getting hard to be a small independent PvP corp in a world where hot-dropping caps on a five-man gang was now a thing. So a bunch of us quit, and a bunch of us moved on to new corps. 
---
I found myself as a bittervet in corp full of week old noobs, promising them zero-zero roams and PvP content and instead delivering a high-sec war when I tried to gank a ratter in a nearby low-sec system. 
---
Wupps. 
---
So a few weeks of back and forth followed. There were a few skirmishes, many ganks and even a couple of straight up battles. The war ended after their spider-repping BS gang jumped into us. Out of rep range of each other, we took them down and set them running.
---
They cancelled the war dec about ten minutes after the fight. I got a medal. 
---
But see if you miraculously outplay them then it’s the fight of your life. I went after a coercer in a comet on the hunch that I might be able to defang him, out range his rockets (zkilled the guy first), and whittle through his buffer, but then the neuts were too much and I could keep range on him, so I died. But man would that have been awesome had it worked
---
I have three times as much blueloot buried in Solitude. I’m down AF. 
---
The point is if/when their first bot nyx gets banned, the barrier/cost to injecting the next one is increased.
---
Its OK, they'll continue to remake the NPE every 4 months while ignoring all of the shit reasons why people don't stay.  With the downward trend on the last couple remakes, I give it another couple years before the NPE is 2005 level again.
---
CCP has a QA department. You can even volunteer to be a part of it.
---
Ban injectors from Eve. Thanks.
---
As a wormhole, high sec terrifies me on the premise of now I KNOW there’s tons of people there that might be following me, waiting for me to make myself vulnerable and then gank me. It’s terrible
---
Tanked that like a boss
---
You two gonna bone already or what?  \*grabs camcorder\*
---
But PGL says Carriers cannot be beaten by subs...
---
That's 2bil ~~ isk on Rmt sites.
---
Right, I just don't understand what changed all of a sudden. Seemed like they were steady around 5B for a while.
---
True enough, but I would argue that you have to know how to play before you can learn how to cheat, at least as effectively as BoB did. :D 
---
I used to be in Evictus. The tax was only applied to HS wars loss.
---
I mean, to look for 'alts' I would just take the total number of accounts someone has (for me it is four), then subtract one (leaving me with three alts). It does not really matter which account is the main, or has the most SP, or whatever. 
---
Basically it would just be a measure of how many accounts do people have over the single account necessary to qualify as an eve player. 
---
There was a incident a couple months ago where some guy that was supposedly botting them dumped his stash, dropping the market from ~7b to 3b
---
This is endemic to the MMO industry period. When last I worked on an MMO, which will remain nameless, there were over 53,000 *known* issues (aka bugs) in the dev tracking database that were awaiting fixes on your average day. 
---
And if you do the math on this, there were roughly 8 full time developers, two full time artists, two full time coders, and two QA teams of 6 working alternating shifts (one day shift, one night shift). How long do you think it would have taken to fix all those bugs? :D :D 
---
And trust me, that never stopped the release of new content. To be honest, when it comes to MMOs, lack of regular new content is more likely to kill your game than having many serious and obvious bugs in the game. 
---
PS. I worked for a shitty company (known for being shitty) and this was a 'big budget'/AAA MMO. 
---
In his defense, a clone bay is often used to prevent accidentally jumping instead of bridging.
---
Now the default overview, that is unforgivable.
---
People seem to forget that the monical was not what started the summer of rage, that the cosmetic stuff was not the issue either.
---
Eve players would of accepted and been fine with the expensive transactions, because we adapt.  We would of been fine with incarnia being a buggy mess and a single room, because again, we adapt.  we would of written off the greed is good memo as meh.
---
the problem actually was that all three happened at once.  It created a shitstorm that ccp could not stop.  Greed is good was the icing on the cake.  Incarnia being 4 years of wasted dev time (hell ambultion showin in 2007 WAS AWESOME! but they scrapped it for the crap we got) it basicly showed wasted resources,  wrong direction and stupidioty all at once.
---
Any one of these alone would of had some forum rage.  but all at once?  that was a recipe for disaster.
---
The video cutting all the way back to the start of the engagement just because the first music track ended was pretty silly, in my opinion. 
---
You had viewers invested in a really great fight then you completely cut it off with no prior warning. Now they have to skip ahead 15 minutes to get to the part they were excited about and continue watching.
---
https://youtu.be/Vxr53ORk1kE?t=973 is approx. where it cut off if anyone wants a timestamp to skip to.
---
Besides that, awesome, loved it
---
If they did shift nova to being attached to eve as win 2.0 then hell yea.  Maybe people will shut up about scam citzen and play a real game.
---
You're misinterpreting my words, I didn't say it was easy overall but that it was easy to make it (the most likely incomplete and buggy code) run faster than CCP's legacy shit. Not using Python will immediately give you a massive speed boost.
---
Going back to your strawman, WoW also has a complex system of multiple servers, instances, etc. and there are private servers for it so it's definitely possible.
---
yeah you just need a specialised doctrine and to outnumber them 3:1, ezpz caps are balanced 
---
*gasp!*
---
I know you. You are one of THEM! http://www.minerbumping.com/

Now, there is currently the issue of 10 BILLION ISK you guys owe me for not subverting your organization. Prompt payment would be appreciated. Thanking you.
---
Wowza. How do you bot them? I thought it required human interaction to help science or something.
---
&gt;They did not give you each race. They gave you each race you had cruiser V in or something. I remember when they put in racial battlecruiser skills and I only got Minmatar and Gallente Battlecruiser V--the two races I was cross trained in--and no others. 
---
&gt;There are different degrees of nuetral,
---
Like 50 shades of grey?
---
Upgrade your clone, bra.

The bot must have been updated to handle that.  Been doing that when i see this going on.

I created this part like teaser + for part of ppl who dont understand russian. Cause if i didn't create this part anyone write me in coms "dude, wat do u think about your eng community" :)   
---
This video is not a serious project, I understand that very few people know Russian and this is not particularly relevant here, but everyone loves good pvp in this game. 
---
Not really you can brute force the mini game technically. 
---
&gt;to omega sub your main. 
---
Right, but in order to afford the isk cost of plexing your account, you will need 3 extractors, which comes to almost over $16; OR, you will need to use the part of the isk you get from 'selling' the first injector to buy more extractors, and just doing the math quickly in my head on that, you are going to have to eat roughly 4 million SP (may more) on your main doing it that way. 
---
Limited time for them being available on the store? 
---
Holy prostate, it's u/CCP_Falcon himself! Has Chin Chin been appeased?!
---
That threw me off too. It just means they came from a limited time offer.

It's like tagging some things Faction or T2. It doesn't mean they expire.

As if drones do some kind of magical damage type? Every ship in the game with resist bonuses gets reduced damage from drones. Theres also no ships in the game with "reduced damage from turrets and launchers" lmao

That's always an option too, though I would never recommend RMTing. Really though, what's the worst that could happen (other than getting your account hacked)? You lose the two billion after you use it to plex your account? 
---
2 billion is not that hard to make. Though making 4 billion in a month to plex for next month would probably be a pain in the ass for a returning player.

The best way to get a "fair" fight, usually comes with a bit of research. Stay away from major blobs like Goons, TEST, Frat, Horde, Brave, etc. They'll generally have some big comms with enough people who are bored and more than happy to dogpile on roamers for easy kills.
---
Take a fast ship, something like a Garmur or Slicer, and roam around the nullsec systems of smaller entities. Use dotlan to find people who own small number of systems, like 4-5 or so, below double digits. There used to be some interesting fights to be had by harassing renters, but your mileage may vary today, but still worth checking out. 
---
Take your fast ship and go poke them. See what kind of response you get, how fast it takes them to form up and what kind of ships they'll bring. Use that knowledge to get a good idea of whether you can bring a solo ship to fight them.
---
Zkb is a great tool to see if the small entity you are planning on engaging know how to fit their ships. If their fits are generally poor, or not very well developed, you might be able to engage them in a 1v3 or a 1v4 and still come out on top.
---
1v1s are very hard to come by, and you're gonna have to put in the hustle to find the places where you're more likely to get them. Avoid blobs and put in the research.
---
Given that, it makes little sense to do anything in Eve other than buy ISK and then pvp. 
---
*Now I think I am finally beginning to understand...*

I'm a new player. Please, Do not make it even more tedious. It's already extemely long.

---
If you call losing 2 srp'able supers a dunk then you're delusional.  2 supers is only 100 Bil which is means ALREADY REPLACED. 
---
I would say 1 of 3 things happened.
---
1) Nothing happened. Marshals have a very low turnover rate. Not a lot die, and relatively very few are purchased due to the prohibitive cost for such a very niche ship, and anyone who wanted one probably already has one. However, as more and more players get to level 500 in Project discovery, the market becomes more saturated. Supply is up, demand is down.
---
2) Basically the same as above, but someone wanting to just unload the ship as quick as possible listed one on the market well below the .01 Isk sellers, causing a portion of them to undercut that seller, and again, due to the low velocity that these ships sell at, a number of sellers ended up undercutting each other at the now deflated price. Being one of those people who tends to sell items well below the .01'ers, I see this happen first hand all the time, and sometimes I'll take advantage of it. Fuck the .01 isk bots.
---
3) Basically the same as 2, but someone is intentionally driving down prices to buy out the stock at a deflated value, so to resell the entire market share at a profit. Actually, the more I think about it, and knowing what I know about people like Aryth who do a more complicated version of this with market commodities like moon goo, I'm leaning towards this answer. It would seem to work well for an item with such low trade volume and extremely limited supply.
---
I really have no evidence to back any of these assertions up, they are just the first thing that came to mind.
---
Oh, my sweet summer child...
---
It's not a meaningful roadblock. All the bot character would need to do is plex for a single month and slam home all the injectors then. You're increasing the cost by 500 plex, nothing more.
---
No, it won't.
---
"How do this game ?"

Exactly where I want to be, watching eve unfold exactly as I want it to with minimal effort.
---
I don’t know if it exactly fits your description, but if you listen to EVE Radio, sometimes the DJ’s offer to duel in ships of their choosing. There are usually fitting and max isk rules etc. Just throwing it out there.
---
That's actually a destroyer, not a frigate.  
---
They died. But TEST has a shield super fleet now. And goons have enough for thier own as well. 
---
why are you attacking poor innocent miners? In a dictor no less?!
---
You know if the botter can inject a nyx, he can pay easily 500 plex more to omega.
---
I recognise this meme
---
Obligatory AAA is shit.
---
Solar Winds be crazy these days.
---
Sure you dont mean dragoon? Coercer is the laser boat.
---
And yeah totally. Just fought a kiting hookbill in a comet that I completely missed on dscan. Managed to survive long enough to whittle away at him (was rail fit  thankfully) and force him out. No kill, but I didn't die so yeah. 
---
I had the chance to run a couple times after slingshotting him but nope. Fight to the end
---
I have to believe CCP just love trolling the community. It's the only way I maintain my sanity.
---
Yeah, but the volume in Jita is very low. Just over 1 Minmatar ESS sold a day on average. 
---
I used to bring ORE blueprints from Outer Ring to Jita which at the time would get me 3-400 mill a BPO. But dealing with that low volume and constantly having to adjust your order to have any shot to move your unit got old. 
---
I mean, if you can afford to buy skill injectors why don't you plex with that isk too? Considering omega's double sp gain puts you up to just shy of 2 injectors worth of additional sp in the first place, plus all of the other benefits like no ship/skill restrictions and being able to make a proper skill queue... seems kinda like a no brainer?
---
Not even close to trying to subvert restrictions at a bank. Nope, no thanks.
---
Thank you, appreciated.
---
No that place is commonly referred to as "Delve"
---
well i use a Deimos often. and it doesn't have to be a 1v1 perse,
---
like the 1v3 or 4's are the best and ask to push every module to its limits.

but thanks for the tips never really scout ahead,but i try to avoid big alliance space.

The DRF Russians had a massive (for the time) super fleet, purchased in large part from the NC - as in Northern Coalition, not to be confused with NC. - using ISK from botting NPC drones that used to drop valuable ore as loot. Then a bunch of FCs in NC did way too much blow one night and decided that Drone Regions would be a fun place to invade. You know, like invading Russia in the winter. Well, things did not go so well for NC, and long story short, DRF along with pretty much everyone else in the game that wasn't NC invaded and pushed their shit in so deep that every time they coughed they sharted.
---
I was in WIDOT at the time back when it was a full alliance still, before the term Widot'ed was a thing, and I remember being legitimately awestruck at the amount of fire power that the Russians would bring. We fought tooth and nail for months, but the fucking Russians just kept coming with massive super numbers. It wasn't until the battle for (I think) Mostly Harmless' (Mostly Useless) or maybe Morsus Mihi home system up in bumfuck Fade or Pure Blind or wherever that I knew that the war was over though. We ended up bringing something like a couple of alpha fleets to defend, MH and/or MM didn't even bother showing up. The Russians on the other hand, showed up with something like 800 supers and like 100+ titans. Keep in mind, this was back in the day when seeing a single titan on field was impressive, and seeing like 10 was newsworthy. To this day that is the reason why CFC/Imperium have had standing orders to never, ever, ever sell supers outside of the coalition.
---
As to where they all went, who knows. I assume most of the pilots from back then all won EVE and there must be hundreds of supers doomed to spend the rest of eternity in asset recovery.

If you want profit, minimum setup is one scanner/looter(/warpin) and one ganker. I ganked industrials for months in 0.5-0.6 in a Vexor, and with one scanner 2 jumps before, which I logged off to log in a hauler to scoop loot after kills.

What is alphas also got 1/2 as much isk from rats in low and nullsec?  
---
This way new honest players arent hurt during their early days and if they like the game they can go omega and move to nullsec.

STANDING ON NY FEET
---
Thats means "faggots"
---
Hey bud! 
---
I don't necessarily agree with the arguments myself, but this is the line of thinking:
---
After Rorquals were re-designed to be the best mining ship in the game, it became much easier to gather the minerals necessary to build capital ships.  Skill Injectors allow new characters to almost instantly fly a Rorqual to gather more minerals, or to fly a carrier / super carrier / titan.  
---
Both of these factors have led to more capital ships in null sec and low sec.  This in turn has lead to more income from mining and capital ratting, and more combat based on capitals.  Some entities in the game who prefer sub-capital ships dislike the proliferation of capitals because it is much more difficult to roam and attack groups that can easily drop a capital fleet on them.  
---
It means 'soon dead aliance'
---
rly?
---
OBS your fights. Watch the loss but really pay attention to the wins and see where the other fuy messed up. Learn and keep undocking. Theory is great but then its about practice.

&gt; If you only have 10 pilots, capitals may not be the best idea because it makes you much more of a target :)
---
This is a pretty heated topic of conversation..  We'll have 10 that can fly capitals, but several others in sub caps.   Point well taken.
---
Wow servers effectively do not interact, EVE servers interact constantly.

Yup

Kill what keeps up, run away from things that’ll kill you. Always be on the sunside of your grid, it’s akin to the higher ground. It’ll give you many places to quickly warp to (everything between you and the sun as well as everything behind it) if you have to bail and you don’t have to cross your enemies to warp.

I am a (potential) returning player who has been reading up on patch notes and reddit before jumping back in again.  I left right after Rorquals and was just a line member.
---
I’m looking to get back probably as solo explorer and solo PvP but am a bit concerned with the complaints about balance and (more concerning to me) broken local.
---
Is this stuff the average player should be concerned about or will my limited engagements be unaffected?  Is it just noise?
---
&gt;  this is what happens when you ban people from barges but not battleships. 
---
And you allow them to use lots of T2 modules (Miners, Cargo)

Good for you man !

Actually, it was afternoon some 16 hours later, but I was completely ready to take any wh to known space at that point and go back the long way, or perhaps set a camp in a new location for while, or get blown to pieces, but that would be just waste of ammo imo. That's what I like, nothing holds me so far and ships I fly are dirt cheap even for me, so why be afraid. :)
---
Yes. We need walking in stations. In person p2p clothing barbie doll interaction, finally. Forget about super proliferation, mining, war decs, chat, injectors, this is what we need.

Admit how many of you were not playing when that clusterfuck dropped.

Hey op, it's Russians - I don't care.

I will poke fun at the homies with this ;)

Change Capital BPO to Capital BPC. You cant buy them from NPC you can only get them from running a special set of missions. DED or Abyssal or something new. Give the BPO owners 500 billion for every BPO and lets be done with this.

I was going to make a reasonable reply, then I saw that you went out of your way to make sure everyone knows you're part of the trial alliance of a pet alliance.

Actually, they pretty much added that. There is the 'arena' at the end of abyssal sites (I have not done them yet so I don't know much about it). However it's cruisers only, one on one, and you can't warp out. Doesn't get much more 'fair' than that.

It is insane money.

In my personal life experience, "Hold my beer and watch this" typically does not end well.

IIRC, this was when PL used a tactic that is now a declared exploit to de-tether the titan and kill it.

I think it was using burst jammers to keep him from safe logging so they could bump him, but I don't remember for sure.

People will figure out exactly how to counter the thing they use for a vni though

I came back to EVE because WIS was going to be a thing. I also ended up leaving because WIS never became a thing. I may come back to it if it does. It may interest my wife also with the way they described stations. Definitely interested in Project NOVA. Would have played dust a bit more if it wasn't on console. Hopefully things will start to move in the right direction.
---
Did ccp put their fix in the launcher? Because that's not totally easy to bypass at all.
---
I think seeing a realistic overview (a spreadsheet taking up a significant portion of the screen) isn't exactly appealing.
---
Oh oh, can I complain about HICs, and how absolutely shit they are?

Scamming haulers, ganking, ransoming DSTs, being a pirate, and hauling stuff from NS or LS to HS to profit from player ignorance.

I bet he feels dumb now!
---
more like we get this game shutdown in 2021 instead of 2013. 
---
Clearly the capital problem is because of skill injectors. C'mon bruh r/eve is here to complain about everything not one thing at a time.
---
Yea. When citadels were first launched, burst jammers would give the anchored ship a pvp timer, so they couldn't safelog.

i do that but most my fights are relatively onesided (both wins and losses) since i mostly fly frigates

Not as much as they did since BIAB is a thing, there's some interaction between grids, and you can transfer between systems. The rest is stuff like market, chat, etc. that is mostly separate like with WoW. However EVE servers also run waaaaay slower with the 1000 ms tick rate. The biggest interaction is probably local + chat but that's a low bar, if you just randomly place logged on players into locals you're almost at CCP quality.
---
Step One: Open all Character Sheets
---
Step Two: Click on characters very fast

Step Three: MultiBox Alphas

You’re right it seems pretty difficult
---
Sorry what modules decrease damage from. Launchers and turrets specifically that also doesn't do the same for fighters?
---
true, once you've run each site 3 times you can basically solo the whole thing.  I'd mute the incursion teamspeak and chill on my alliance mumble.  pretty hard to fuck up if you aren't an idiot.

Losing a carrier is embarrassing but it happens, that is some wannabe shitler stroking his authority boner.

Just require a second ship to light them. Would allow at least a little solo activity in low/null and there'd still be plenty of danger for them.

yes, it is just like pidor

The corp didn't stay long as far as I remember, neither did I, I actually left it like not even two month after joining. The CEO was never there, the logistics guy always got ganked in High-Sec with JFs cause of wardecs, all sorts of stupid shenanigans.

---
And if that is the case, we welcome the change.  Evicting some renters is a minor inconvenience and well worth removing botters and botting isk from the game.
---
The timing is a bit off though.  CCP said they did this a couple weeks ago, but KWG were a couple months behind on rent.
---
It's not ideal but it will also double their risk and result in more dead botters
---
If you read through his post a bit you will see he's a master shit poster.
---
You're on the right path. Set an interesting goal, join a different group, and branch out into other areas of the game you have't explored yet. Most EVE players experiment with a lot of different play styles before they find the one that keeps interested in the game.
---
You can always start a chat channel with your old corp members in game to keep in touch. Really if they are in highsec you can always join in on their activities whenever you want anyway while also being able to experience something new.
---
Looks like a smartbomb hotdrop in progress :)

Rooster is apparently prison slang for homosexuals so it's a big insult.
---
I'd roughly estimate that on average lowsec belt ratting for tags, mordus, and faction spawns probably averages out to what a subcap running anoms in a good trusec upgraded system would make in terms of isk per hour. 
---
Not only that but moon mining is the same in lowsec but rorquals are a lot riskier to use due to the lack of a supercap umbrella. I found that most groups that own good moons in lowsec have a lack of people interested in mining them since most people are in lowsec for the pvp and not the pve.
---
Finally the DEDs available in lowsec are the best you can get. The deadspace cruiser mods are worth the most and the sites are much easier to run in general.
---
I've lived in lowsec the past 2 years now and its the best experience I've had with the game in a long time.
---
I didnt know they put a tasiy gate in 1DQ. But nah it's taken on the test server in M-O
---
Generally local is fine. It has had issues at times. For some it is pretty triggering. For wormholers it's just another day. Wormholes don't show others on local chat unless they speak. If you're planning on explo using cov ops frigs are nice. In Null sec you may very well have a fleet dropped on you at times including carriers and such. In wormhole space you may find solo and small gangs but large fleets shouldn't be ruled out. As for balance complaints it depends on which ones you heard.
---
I mean if you leave all the good cans till last, and we assume you're interrupted at a random point somewhere in running the site, odds are that you're not getting the good cans. Wheras if you ran the good cans first, odds are you get the good cans.  So probabilistically speaking,  good cans first is superior to  good cans last. 
---
Yep.

Yeah the ^^ was big in Germany ~13 years ago. But wasn't it everywhere?

Question about jump freighter safety. Let's assume you are in a low sec system with a high sec connection and several ships are in system waiting at the gate connecting to high sec. Is it ever possible for your jump freighter to be attacked/destroyed in the time between finishing warping to the high sec gate and jumping through? 
---
Hey it's a great vid, fun to watch. I'm glad Leshaks gettin' used. This BR is impressive, a small note is that they never had more than 7 on grid fighting you at any time during the video. Grats on the frags
---
To be fair, I haven't spent real money on injectors, and I don't plan to, but I did buy an injector with ISK once.
---
Honestly it doesn't affect me much, and if people are gonna buy injectors with real money or ISK, they can probably afford omega as well. This might help CCP financially, and would do wonders in fighting bots.
---
Look at all those frags
---
It could be a combination of people not playing anymore and the bot thing. I heard CCPs been cracking down on it in increments.
---
No it means gay. I’m not letting you bamboozle our non-slavic friends!!!
---
Oh good, they use "trust the client" validation. That always works well. 
---
Yet it's still using that abysmal default overview...
---
I wonder how you're going to sleep in your couch since you're in a pod, that is IN your ship.

---
If the DPS volleys were on point then logi would be completely useless, but they're usually staggered across a few ticks which lets logi get a few reps in. I'd say maybe logi saves 1/4 to 1/2 of primaries against an alpha fleet?
---
Umm well skyooz me but this is murica and we speak murican. If it was good nuff fur jeezus its good nuff fur me.
---
Yeah, but seriously f*ck that sh*t. Don't think of it as buying 2b for cheap. Think of it as putting another VNI bot out in the game, or putting another wave of atron bots through faction warfare, or putting another 10 distribution mission running bots in highsec. 
---
Because that's where that ISK comes from. You don't pay 5.5€ for 2bn ISK, you pay 5.5€ for that amount of bot time. If you need RMT ISK to return to the game, then do us a favor and stay away.  
---
Imagine being so mad about some small scale collective you go to reddit and start swearing at them while not even expecting them to be here.
---
The super wonky ridiculous configurations is what makes so many older games amazing.
---
Now the developers want to take that fun part out of the game and have control over every aspect of the game. You should be happy players discover little tricks in your games not MAD they found something you as the developer didn't think of.
---
That mentality is ruining games.
---
Yes. Activating it consumes 1 unit of strontium (or ozone, can't remember), it cycles for 1 minutes (or 5, again, fuzzy memory), and while it is active the ship can not warp or jump. Smart titan pilots use it as a safety, and that is literally it's only useful purpose.
---
More players would have used it if it wasn’t walking around in a single room.... like honestly how was that all ccp got out of that? 
---
I'm always suprised by people who think people who are worried about 15 bucks have the same kind of discretionary expenses to cut as they do. If they're agonizing over something like this, they probably torrent. 
---
That's not to say that there isn't people out there with piss poor fiscal managment skills, but even then that's usually more of a "spend it or lose it" mentality reinforced through years of poverty that discourages saving and investment. 
---
Asset saftey requires an FPS match.  Defenders have to hold out X minutes while the evacuation happens, attackers need to steal everything not nailed down.

I’ve seen quite a few first impressions video where people praise the character creator and then are flabbergasted that they never get to see their character... and having the option to queue up for FPS events and “raids” (for a lack of a better word) would definitely up the appeal of eve. You would be more than just a spaceship floating around in space....

Loads of PvP folks there looking to brawl, odds are good you'll eventually be mobbed by newbeans flying cheap tackle ships, but you'll get a fight.

I'm still sad and want my nanomach with cruise missiles back. It was perfect to fly faster than your ammo :D

But have you seen the devastating ugliness of his body? 
---
Certainly possible, but when the early core gameplay is orbiting npc ships and clicking a single button, warping around for hours, or shooting a little laser at a asteroid - I don't know how much walking in stations would help.
---
If you use the word pet to describe INIT. you either haven't been around very long or don't know very much.

1. If there were no Injectors, Barges would still be widely used rather than Rorquals.
---
2. Capital Pilots should have been rare, see what happens if there are tons of Capitals.
---
3. Training a super carrier takes 3 years. (refer to no. 2)
---
4. 3-4 years for titan. (again, refer to no. 2)

---
To be honest, I think the real question to ask is "Why do you want to stay in highsec?". I mean yes, highsec is "risk-free" (or rather, risk-lite), but I believe the most enjoyable time you can have in EvE is the time you spend risking your hide in some mad gamble, especially when that gamble pays off. The rest is tedium and administrativa. 
---
If you're looking for a way to expose yourself to measured risk and to get some hits of adrenaline whilst making ISK, I can recommend faction warfare. You can also go lowsec pirate, which amps up the adrenaline, in exchange for income i guess.
---
There's also stuff in nullsec, but I find that stuff tends to seperate the money making from the risk taking more, and individual losses are larger and more upsetting.  
---
And if you want to go drink from the firehose of 'oh shit, oh shit', theres roaming around WH space.

Any serious botting setups should be running as many clients and their computer can handle. I don't think they can just double the number of bots they run without a big rl investment.

Make it impossible to inject into caps or supers. You can inject to a certain point but not to the extent you can fly the ships.
---
Hey man, glad to hear your story. I think that's where Eve becomes a genuine experience. Changing something about your life is difficult, especially when you're sorrounded by dirt and filth and you're left to your own devices.
---
I threw my life against the wall once, having ruined my vocational training over drugs and even having been homeless for a short period of time. At some point I was sitting on the sidewalk, between all the piss and shit, thinking "Dude, something's really going wrong here, that's not where you wanted to end up!"
---
Knowing I had a warrant open by the police, the first thing I did was turning myself in, not only to buy myself time, but to settle this for once. The cops would have been on my doorstep anyway no matter where I turned myself to to get help for myself. Two years later, while I was high, a friend of mine made me so angry about myself that I stopped drugs entirely and got sober. I can't say my way of life is alright now, but at least I have a comfortable home now and I don't have to rely on a soup kitchen to eat something.
---
It's important to share these stories, because someone out there might probably sit in the same darkness without a guiding hand. Too many lose to their struggles.

What if they changed it so that you could not apply allocated skill points to capital ship based skills?

I tend towards the suicidal because I get the thrill of beating the odds *just often enough* to keep me coming back like the addict I am. Yes, I only beat that pirate frig 1 time out of 10 in my T1 frigate. But that one time is *such* a rush :)
---
What makes you say that? Not defending it one way or another, just curious about general opinion
---
'member,

Just pick your engagements carefully.  Use dscan on a cloaky or evasive scout to find a target and then fight him.  That's basically the only way.

The capital rebalance will have to wait for the real important stuff.

Also some fun facts, this war is where NCdot and PL developed such close ties, as they played a large part in being a spearhead for the DRF forces as well as waging some highly effective asymmetric warfare campaigns, which is a large part of where the NCPL boogeyman thing started.

7o brother, eve has the best gaming community that nothing can surpass both in game violence and being shit, real life sincerity and support. Glad you made it back to being well and congratulations on the engagement! Also I will gank you tonight with a molok, just a friendly caution note :)
---
why don't you make a note of numbers on each side? is it bait? I thought Legacy/XIX actually did smth cool, clicked the BR, and it was 524 v 160
---
Helping Eve noobs is one of the best feelings ever. 
---
&gt;SkillU/Scourge brought a Muninn and Machariel fleet respectively, while Legacy brought a Ferox fleet assisted by DRF in an Ishtar fleet. SkillU/Scourge was outnumbered 524 to 160 by defending Legacy/DRF forces.
---
just remember those numbers for when TEST also deploy to defend their pets against an exIstEntIaL tHrEaT

I like flying the Orthrus. **If I scram an enemy drone, does it shut off it's MWD?** 
---
I've been using a web to slow down enemy drones to make them easier to kill in abyssal PVP, but a scram gets a range bonus from the hull and it could have a similar/better effect if the MWD shuts off.

It's raw footage. you probably shouldn't publish it.

Sometimes I would gank someone in lowsec that obviously was a noob doing missions. I would ransom them a reasonable amount like 5mil to not blow up their ship or I would give them more than enough to replace their ship.

Counter Argument: Alpha accounts makes this trivial either way, you can just have 3 months worth of charactors being built up to continually supply your chain if nessisary.
---
The only reason they wouldn't do that is because they are lazy and don't have to, so they inject their guys to get them back in the action. This is actually a tax they are imposing on themselves, and a barrier to entry that may detract people from contiplating the simpler free option (though, admitadly not many, and not the brightest).

I don't disagree that botters are a problem, but this will do nothing to prevent them from being previlant, and will only reduce one of the only mitigations that we have.

I love Lussy Lou, but if you are dropping a video on an English forum, with an English title, one would expect the video to be in English too. Obviously that's a lot to ask for in regards to editing, but it's definitely a very valid criticism.
---
Agreed, that's how you make friends and recruit people.
---
I always send isk right after I checked their employment history if the fit on the ship is really bad. it's so easy to get pissed off when you first start because of how hard it is to make isk early on so I really want to make sure it gets back to them fast enough that they can feel some relief.

The greatest method to make the most money in Eve exists in high-sec. Nothing can surpass market trading.
---
What does a good overview look like then? I've been playing for free for about a year but i've never seen anything else than the normal overview
---
I once ganked a Venture in hisec, just because I was bored.
---
Would have felt like a total dick otherwise, so I sent him 25M to help him recoup his losses.
---
Join a Corp, playing solo is boring no matter how many skill points you have 
---
Sadly you can't activate a scram on a drone.
---
why?
---
Yesterday I blew up a destroyer and the guy said it was his greatest experience in EVE of all time. There are just some things money can't buy.
---
Yes. It's possible for a sufficiently skilled (autistic) gate camper to pilot their ship into you as you are landing, and bump you out of the gate before you can jump through it, thus leaving you vulnerable. This is what I've heard at least. 
---
You should be able to avoid that by having a bookmark closer to the gate, and warping to your bookmark at 0 instead of the gate, although I don't know the risks regarding bumping off the gate itself in that case. 
---
To be fair, I actually killed the first drifter battleship I encountered in my first run. I just spent way too long sitting still that time. 
---
I’d say don’t go to geminate unless you know more of what you’re doing. Our response fleet can vary from a couple t1 frigs to a few dozen people in assault frigates and battleships, and going through the oijanen gate into our space without a scout isn’t a good idea. 
---
Wicked creek probably isn’t too bad, they take a while to form a response fleet and usually when they do they use some pretty obvious bait 
---
The main argument here is the tyranny of the opmial strategy.
---
Caps have always been good, even before they were buffed, they still had a lot going for them - power wise.
---
Even beyond capitals, super blinged out ships would always in theory beat out unblingy ships. However, this never really becomes _the_ dominant strategy because other factors balance peoples desire to use it. As much as "isk is not a balancing factor" is a useful meme, it isn't literally true, as willingness to anti-up is a big factor on forces to bear on most combat.
---
The issue is that capitals had three things holding them back
---
A) They were very expensive, on a magnatude that made most subcap pilots balk
---
B) They required a _VERY_ long skill plan to get into, one that took a while to pay off in any meaningful way
---
C) They weren't _that_ much better than subcaps, espeshally given A + B
---
So, what we have seen is these three factors dramatically change in quick succession, often seemingly not considering the other factors when they change.
---
The power, but more importantly newfound popularity of mining, has lead to much cheeper ships, but _specifically_ T1 ships. T2 has actually gone up in cost if anything, given the moon changes. This means Caps have gone done significantly in relitive cost to high end subcap ships. Combine that with the way that insurance is calculated on mineral costs, capitals become down right cost effective.
---
Skill injectors made the training into a cost analysis. While it was true you could buy a capital pilot on the bizzar, Skill injectors has made this track accessible, and allowed players to maintain thier chosen identity as they step up to being a cap pilot in the first month. Overall the second barrior was reduced to an isk, or cash cost. 
---
Finally, caps were buffed, and specifically in ways that made them far more capabile against subcaps. At the same time there was a host of new reasons for apex force battles released in the form of the new structure system. 
---
All of this combined makes it very easy to argue that Capitals are _the_ optimal strategy to get into the game. It is easy to argue that the entire game is a grind to capitals, a grind that can be circomvented... with money.
---
Does this sound fun? Nope. So, at least one of those three needs to be broken.
---
A) Have Capitals cost Materials or resources beyond standard minerals. (the least palatible option)
---
B) Establish such that capital skills can not be gained from unallocated SP. It would screw over a few people, including myself, but it would ensure that capital training was the slow painful process it was meant to be.
---
C) Balance them in such a way that they are not THE optimal solution. Svipuls were bad, but having the FOTM be something that asks people to pay money to circomvent the wait, well it starts to seem like they are balancing it to support their F2P model, rather than good balance.
---
Long story short, if we accept that capitals are _the_ optimal strategy for isk making, combat, and general playing of the game, than it has profound impact on the rest of the game. That psycological conflict is played out in the arguments you see around capitals, and how dead everything is :P
---
let's just say you belong there then and leave it at that :&gt;
---
Nope just about 70bil it would seem
---
I swear I saw a bunch (at least 7) in Jita for just over 1b, and thought that was too much.
---
In retrospect, I should have bought them all.
---
Sort of like the Silvershore, but I bought one when it was 1b.
---
\&gt; something, something, Skill Injectors
---
Industry 5 is debatable, I probably would have picked another skill to raise the skill requirement. On the other hand, Transport ships already have rather low requirements. If a ship doesn't require more than 3 months it's not skill intensive. Training for the first TS is somewhat above a month of training.
---
I was paying for 2 accounts and only playing 1 for almost my entire time playing. CCP game me back 54 mil SP.

lmao cheeki breeki
---
I'd fit up a t1 scanning frig with an expanded probe launcher, some combat probes and some salvagers and head to either the gal/cal or min/amarr faction warfare areas.
---
You can use the probes to scan down t2 drones (I've even found augmented drones and the odd gecko) and loot abandoned player wrecks. Most of the time they'll either be empty or just have cap boosters but you can find t2, expensive meta or even faction mods.  
---
If the wrecks are from t2 or t3 ships, descibed as 'advanced/elite' on d-scan they can be salvaged for t2 salvage, some of which sells for a good price. 
---
And you'll have to avoid gatecamps/pirates/angry locals.  It's a great way to learn the area and improve your d-scan technique.   
---
I always enjoyed overly reimbursing noobs that were good spirited about the loss. They're usually open to take advice so it feelsgoodman. Now I pretty much just solo gank shiny industrials and get the dry "having fun...?"
---
1.2k EHP ship vs. 2k+ wrecking-hits
---
unexpected results
---
&gt; Also, how easy is it to make money/outfit your ship? If I get ganked and lose my stuff, can I easily start over and get to where I was as a beginner? How about as a mid or high level player?
---
That depends on what ship you fly and how fancy the modules are that you fit onto it. A common rookie mistake is to spend all ones ISK on the fanciest ship / modules they can get and then go and lose it all. An important motto is "don't fly what you can't afford to lose."
---
But if you fly something like a basic exploration frigate, you could earn enough ISK in an hour to replace it tenfold over.
---
You shouldn't overestimate the risk of getting ganked though. If you don't go looking for trouble or making a target of yourself (for example by flying a very expensive ship), you can go a long time without losing a ship to another player. But since basic ("tech 1") ships are cheap and can still be used with good results, you shouldn't feel like you must avoid conflict as a new player.
---
I was actually sad they removed it.
---
It wasn't amazing but I don't see why it needed to go.

Most people will join some null or low sec Corp before deciding if they want to pay for omega. This would definitely hurt new players quite a bit

I can only make assumptions here, but as far as I know, most of the data is already solved, eg the transits are known already. So if you had access to this data you could probably compare the images or something like that.

I always reimburse new players as long as the don't go full reeee about me killing them. The ones obviously learning to pvp in small cheap stuff I usually reimburse 5-10 times over just to fund their habbit a while longer. Easily one of the best things about the game.

to be fair, that doesn't indicate a player's age really. Many people try the game, then say fuck it, then come back years later. As for the bounties, people in rookie help do that for shits and giggles  all the time. They scream 'OH WHAT WHO PUT BOUNTY PLEASE STOP' because they think the bounty system actually MEANS something XD

So I've been using a web instead of a scram in Abyssal PVP knowing I'm often fighting a Gila or Curse, as the reduced velocity helps deal full missile damage and I'm often out of scramrange anyway (\~50KM). It causes me problems if I encounter a Deimos or Vedmak, as they get in close and web me and I don't have the scram to get away.  
---
It helps in the PVE aspect as well if a frigate drone gets too close and I need to drop it fast. 
---
I tried to find a good resource for missile damage calculations and seem to remember their being a really good one. **What's the best tool out there to calculate missile damage application for signature radius and velocity?**

Best part of it all, I kept going back but never made the same mistake twice. Best feeling ever :)

blowing up a new guy who is basically defenseless against you due to inexperience is a dick move, but people want to blow something up. so, people blow the noob up, replace the ship and, if desired by the newbie, often take them under their wing and help them learn to play so they're more likely to stay and enjoy their time here

Long long ago, when I was still jet-can mining in high-sec, some noob in like a Velator came by and attempted to steal from my can. This was after warning him in local repeatedly. "Stay away...don't do it...you really need to back up...I'm not playing, leave it alone..."
---
He probably took a handful of Veldspar, but I felt it necessary to teach him an important lesson. In seconds, drones were all over him. He was probably so shocked that he didn't even move or try to run away. He went kaboom in short order.
---
Afterwards, I sent him a message explaining my actions, along with like 5-10mil. 
---
If you're talking about overheating, sure. With that said, I'm limited on screen space and could use those lovely pixels for other information. 
---
Also, after a while, it's easy to tell when your passives (or actives for that matter) are going to hit 100%.

Well... It didn't work out for him :)

Got into an altercation with an anchored bubble and a Drake in FDZ4 last night. Bubble dies, second Drake shows up while the first one goes down. DPS &amp; point starts to land on the second Drake. Meanwhile a Nidhoggur swags onto field out of nowhere landing in a dictor bubble - no cyno to be found. Cap is suddenly gone, I'm pointed, shield and most armor volleyed, MWD stops, I'm pointed. Wondering WTF happened I see the red box from the nid - started to align out, hit cap booster/both local reppers/mwd and prayed - 10% structure from the next volley - point finally drops and I gtfo.    
---
After coming out of warp for the cap/rep up I hear on comms a Scimitar landed and has started to rep the Drake - someone gets a scram on it but DPS is scattered/dieing to fighters. Warp back in on top of Scimitar, DPS down to 1/5 shield and the fighters start heading back to me - warp out, back in - finish off Scimitar. We shifted our plan to defang the nid but local was climbing and a strat op was pinged for something completely unrelated.    
---
 Easily some of the most fun I've had playing EVE despite nearly getting my asshole wrecked. Wanna cry about carriers? shoot the fucking fighters or get out.

The great war, The Great Northern War, World War bee... All dumb names. Eve players need to get some injectors and up their war naming skills.

&gt;Fit for pvp
---
In anything less than a carrier you can't fit for pvp and run the high-end sites without getting wrecked by rats, aligning out often allows the rats to more accurately apply damage, and you can't go to a different system if someone like the goons or BB are camping 100 of your systems. Bait traps often feature cynos and while rich people can afford to krab in what ever they want a newbro in his first VNI who actually needs the money can't. " Fit a cyno and you have backup a moment away " This being nerfed is what set OP off in the first place. " This is about OP being a lazy chicken-shit. " Seems more like you are missing a large part of their point.

Injecting into a Carrier or Titan pilot in no way, shape, or form adds a single capital ship to the game, as those characters are unable to produce them. Rorquals, yes, but if not Rorqs, then it would be fleets of exhumers.

Input your orthrus fit, then go to Windows -&gt; Graphs. It will take your entire fit into account, including player skills if you add your character API as well. You can fiddle around with values to figure out how much you're gonna apply, and any changes you make to the fitting will update the graph immediately. It looks like this: https://imgur.com/a/TVDb3dS

He was scanning down and i founded him in the dscan in a planet, he didnt saw on grid or at list i think and i busted to his ship and overheated my missiles and activates my long point, and eventually killed him
---
i hate to break it to you, but after alot of code clean up its possible to run a small scale server (1000 players) on even older server hardware, cheating and latency and crap buildup (player assets) will be an issue tho, but its entirely possible for a private individual to run a small scale server, w/ modern high IPC and crazy high core count Workstation and server parts (maily looking at AMD's offerings) it would not even need a large amount of hardware to scale it up to like ... 10k players   
---
you would need some crazy networking tho 
---
Its eve man, we got tons of players around the world. Do you really need English comms (or even an English UI?) to see, understand, and learn from good play?
---
Yeah we miss out of somewhat I'm assuming is great small gang collaboration, but there is plenty to learn from.

yes, it was called sergaljerk and lasted 5 years, then furry drama made em disband

Unpopular opinion: Giving noobs more money than they need or know what to do with takes all motivation out of their game play and ultimately ruins the game for them.

im not talking dual tank rags, those are fine, i mean Rags that have ONLY armor tank mods fitted, stock resists and HP on shield 
---
Interesting how anti-carrier folks have never even touched a basic carrier, let alone fly it into combat. Trust me, carriers aren’t as godly as you think.
---
maybe a bot...
---
Are you really NC. or is that just flair baiting? I can't imagine they'd put up with someone who complains about titan proliferation.
---
First time I was ganked he sent me all my loot and the isk for the ship.  I was so confused.  Only mmo I ever played where it wasn't all cancerous 
---
local doesn't tell you what ship the person is flying or which gate they took to get in.
---
I don't think these people are usually actual noobs though.
---
They have exploration bots now? Is the whole game automated at this point?
---
Nor does an afk cloaky alt? That info all has to be gained through actively moving through system and d-scanning or watching gate grids.
---
Very sad bait.
---
You're elite.

Post I made before you might find useful: https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/a5skih/new_player_looking_for_advise/ebowsyc/?context=3

The #newbie-help channel on the Discord has a lot of great advice 
---
Thanks I’ll have a look now, which discord btw?
---
Edit: saw it on the post my bad
---
Oxymoron 
---
Seems like you're missing most of my points too. Generally speaking making more isk means taking more risk. This is a pattern shared by most isk-making ventures in eve. It applies here as well.
---
Aligning may make rats apply better, but if you use your brain and set up bookmarks at various directions around a system, you can align to minimize dmg from rats.
---
Ratting in a pvp fit will net you less isk, but you'll be safer.
---
Bait traps dont always require cynos, often a pvp fit ship will be enough. And cynos are dirt cheap and OP right now.
---
If you can't afford to lose a vexor Navy issue then you shouldn't be flying it and you should wait until you have enough isk to do so. There are several options for making isk in null. (Im using 'you' in a general sense)
---
If goons or BB are camping your systems, use any of the other methods I've mentioned. Also, grow a pair.
---
OP is most certainly a lazy chicken-shit. The evidence is smeared all over this post.
---
The more time I spend discussing basic problem solving on r/eve, the more I understand what "spodbrain" really means.
---
Cloaky camping is nothing new. Folks have been happily, and easily, countering it for years.
---
If it is not done in a novice plex in a t1 brawl it does not count :P
---
Legacy member here. Skill u may be our enemies but they got my respect for fighting against the odds and pulling off such amazing bombing runs. I was one of the two legacy scimi on the field (the other scimi died, what are the odds lul) and b4r was absolutely chaos after the continued bombing run, everyone in armor n hulls. I might have been on the recieving end of it but it was a beautiful fight. Gf and looking forwards to more fight with you all o7
---
With a fit like that, they're a noob no matter how long they spent in game.
---
Isaac you are a nerd.
---
You have to tell them to say hey to their mother.
---
14 years-in and still learning new shit to do.

Seems like they are a HS bait crew nowadays:

Yup dragoon not coercer my bad. Those are the best fights, where you get caught and still make it out due to outplay
---
Forget about grinding to pay for your account. Grinding to reach goals is ok. Always have a goal. It’s better to fly small ships well, than large ships poorly.
---
Started out doing PvP, never looked back, never really tried anything else. Never did 0.0 anomalies, mined or did a data/relic site
---
Do whatever you enjoy - what works for someone, doesn't work for someone else
---
Find a way out of high sec. Wormhole daytripping is pretty good.
---
Incursion money is quite good to be fair if you can put up with the repetitive nature of it.
---
why
---
Some people arent cut out for eve
---
I blew up a venture in low sec once. I only had a long point on him so he could have warped whenever. I felt so bad that I gave him 20 mil and informed him of his mistake.
---
&gt;If I get ganked and lose my stuff, can I easily start over and get to where I was as a beginner? How about as a mid or high level player?
---
As others have mentioned, the only things at risk are what you carry with you in and on your ship. Generally mid and high level players have dozens of ships ready to go, so losing one is not a huge deal. But sometimes, they'll choose to "bling it out", or fit very expensive gear on their ship to maximize effectiveness, so losing that can hurt like a bitch. 
---
As a new player, you can recover from most losses in a very short time, especially if you insure your ships and avoid outfitting them with gear you can't afford. "Never undock what you can't afford to lose" is a golden rule in this game. Another one is to treat ships like ammo - expendable, replaceable. 
---
My point is, losing a single ship doesn't mean losing all your progress. It just means having to spend a little while replacing that one ship.
