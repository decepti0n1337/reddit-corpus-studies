The same thing was suggested for alpha accounts:  make safety green the only method to set the safety *while in high-sec.*
---

---
High-sec ganking is absolutely an important part of the game and I'm not a fan of CCP taking steps to remove it.  But removing or reducing the ability to gank or suspect bait scam new players in rookie system is a good idea, imo, as is reducing/removing the ability to gank with non-Omega characters.
---
---
---
Ye cause they nerfed them really hard after. Like into the ground. Think they panicked.
---
Thats true. But a lot of people shat on them just for the principle of doing it. If nothing else it was something else for a bit.
---
TLDR; They reached all the way in their ass to pull out this ruse, and wonder why it stinks.
---
yep, Ive seen the same crap too, bro
---
We jammed the tackle and jumped the phoenix out too :D
---
Don’t allow abyssal sites to be run in rookie systems then. No new player can run abyssals (without dying)
---
This is the worst idea since the last thousand risk adverse carebear game killing threads.
---
Wait, is that why you  guys are struggling to keep your systems? I mean, you practically gifted VKI to The Rogue Consortium by moving your capital to F-Y. But hey, you keep enjoying that whatever it is you guys think you are doing well. 
---
I mean, I would really like to see a strong Provi again but until you guys stop being meat shields for CVA, I don't honestly think it will happen.
---
disappointed didn't get any ore out of those lokis, was wondering why the strip miners weren't activating .... i was lied to i was promised being able to mine =\[
---
It hasn't improved.
---
Seriously.
---
Yes, they did a good job on this fight but they are still struggling to hold their systems and keep the ADMs up. So props for this dunk, but don't let the "We are awesome! Come join us!" propaganda fool you.
---
But don’t you get aggression from repping something with aggression?
---
I was new when that happened and I said "I'm gonna go kill that piece of shit" in fleet chat and I was PROMPTLY corrected by about 30 guys that no one refers to Suitonia that way lol. Can confirm, watched his youtube guides, great dude 10/10 would brawl.
---
Err... you can't have more than 1 alpha logged in at a time right?
---
was good alround choas fight most fun brawl i have had in years
---
There have been trig frigs and incursions in the starter system for 15+ years?
---
Oh, only 11 years ago? forgive me.
---
You can with vpn but that’s effort.
---
right because there's nothing like a few hours of space chores to make you regret logging in.
---
Someone hold me I can't breath
---
Thanks for the help everyone. I submitted a ticket. Hope for the best, expect the worse. I noticed the 2FA is now available for EVE. It wasn't when I was on last (I believe). It is now enabled on one of my accounts. 
---
On a side note, The logs go all the way back to 2009. But it looks like they are fake (doesn't actually log everything or else it'll show a different IP range for the criminals/hackers).
---
All my SP is intact, I'm just in a pod across all chars and accounts. ugh.
---
I like this better than the rookie systems by far, but there should be rewards (gotta get that reward loop going early). Maybe the fiction is that some corporate academy is willing to provide you with a ship and a mission if you finish the training. Do all the tutorials and get a ship and mission to kill something, mine something, hack something, haul something, and whatever else goes in the tutorial.
---
But then, you wouldn't want 2-3 year old characters farming in these systems either.
---
I couldn't think of a npc trig station where you could buy those skills from thier market
---
I know you being in TRC won't understand this, but, there is no daylight between COGG and CVA or the other Provi alliances, it's all one.   COGG's role here is so simple it can be summed up in [one gif](https://i.imgur.com/mlhcK7Q.gif).
---
Seed em in the same Concord stations that have the Database npc orders
---
11 years ago the population was higher, because the game was fun, unlike now.
---
for sure.
---
Did they finally fix that bug?
---
Because I multilogged alphas all the time to update skill queues by just logging in in the same tick.
---
Do you think fucking everyone you don’t like over is logical?
---
Oh yeah, Jita is a fun place for that too.
---
Hope no one needs to get anything out of asset safety...
---
Yes. As an example,I don’t like boters and because of that I support CCP f*ing them over
---
Don't forget Snuff shitters
---
TRC? For a minute there I thought I set my flair wrong but it is correct. 
---
As for COGG's role, don't worry, I have several alts in COGG so I am well aware of your "role". LOL
---
El Jefe controls the Yacht market, so #alreadyreplaced?
---
PRED | IS | DERP | BACKWARDS
---
recruiting btw
---
ACL?
---
Meanwhile CCP designed a new skin for the atron!!!
---
You had your chance with goons and blew it. Don't be jelly.
---
But I haven't lived in null in years, I've always been a low sec roamer (but I always avoid FW low sec, since that's where all the min-max'ers with off-grid boosts lived)
---
t. OP
---
You may want to step back from the TRC propaganda stand for a bit there, my friend. It seems you've gotten an excessively concentrated doze.
---
We've been at this little "war" for like a year and a half now. And a grand total of 3 no-ADM systems have been lost in that time. Two of them during the blackout while 80% of our members were taking vacations in high-sec and/or RL.
---
So yea. I'd applaud you guys, but if I were to adopt the rhythm of your progress it would take me about 6 months between claps. Although that would probably work out great, since it would most definitely be an ironic slow-clap.
---
What about a couple of weeks ago, when Boystin (Solitude, 2j from Syndicate) was foothold?
---
OGB hasn't been a thing for like two years. There's still min maxing but you have a better idea of what you're up against now. Get to it.
---
Who the fuck cares what they had?
---
There’s two sides, hunting solo kills outnumbering them 4-1 and outgunning them 100x then bitching because “CaPiTaLs” is pathetic
---
Did you actually read what I wrote?
---
I know for vets with hundreds of billions in the bank pve seems pointless, but you have to do it if you don't have isk.
---
&gt;Also not everything is about isk.
---
**Literally** everything is about isk. You need isk to blow up ships, and you need ships to make that isk(and those sometimes get blown up too). Ironically enough, the big blocs also generally have the best srp/handout systems in place that let you blow up ships and not have to worry about replacement as much.
---
I suppose winning one fight is slightly better than immediately prior to that one fight.
---
FUCK I WAS AT WORK.
---
GOD DANN IT.
---
At least I have cocktails: )
---
Can't I build an empire in peace jeeze
---
the default overview is absolutely garbage.
---
&gt;they'll straight up just leave forever.
---
OKAY. **BYE!!!!**
---
Hi Elise.
---
What? That’s how it works now...
---
Provi batphoned init literally every fight after getting wrecked once.
---
It’s awkard you saying about history when you guys are batphoning in every fight,
---
also we had to phone cuz we was fighting snuff or other batphones.
---
but well I will not blame provi about calling init/test in every timer because it’s how the eve works, especially when your fort got bashed.
---
Haven’t tried shooting the ones on 4-4, but pop the ones on the gates all the time. They are usually empty or have a nado or cata’s loot in it, but helps with the killboafd
---
You have been graced by the magic that is Farfalla, Hunter Extraordinaire. The man could find and tackle a ceptor in a deadspace safe in Thera, I swear. 
---
I had a good time and it was overall a decent fleet. I feel that you could stand to be a little more decisive, but you didn't really hem and haw too much. Overall, I give it a B+, probably woulda been higher if we actually got a fight with Rote.
---
They can't with a VPN.  Guaranteed a LOT of players are exploiting it.
---
Another poster said only allowing a yellow safety. I think that would work in starter systems. Anywhere else are red safety is fair game.
---
I do understand what you are saying, its just that alot of what you said seemed to be aimed at vets, and the recent blackout showed that it wasnt neccesarly an issue with vets, IMO its more of a your playstyle is wrong and my playstyle is right from all sides of the game.
---
Ccp cannot please everyone, and its pointless to try, eve is too niche, ccp need to pick a direction for the game, plot it, and go, without flip floping or showing no clear direction. Trying to attract everyone, and keep everyone is not going to work.
---
Give us the road map, show us the direction and your plan for eve. Whether i agree or not, at least i can support them setting a direction, and i will adapt accordingly.
---
Stop with the half implementation, do something completely, and then move to the next.
---
Change for change sake is a waste of resources, gives us the plan, set your course ccp, and i can at least get behind the game knowing those driving know where the hell we are going.
---
Because currently you look like your trying to be voted most popular at the prom, but actually just slowly pissing everyone off trying to be everyones best bud.
---
Fix pve so its interesting, fix resource blobing, shrink the map to suit the player base, i dont know your the experts with all the data. 
---
Do anything, do something. But stick to it.
---
YES. Perpetuum(now OpenPerpetuum) actually does this and its great. They even went as far as stating in tutorial that "this is simulation, so here you can do stuff you cant do until actually later in game. Heres lategame Tyrannos, try it out all you want. Then in real world youll get starter mech and can work your way to this for real"
---
the infinite cargo trick back in the day you could stack cargo expanders and end up with millions of m3 on a hauler, I'm sure someone used it to get a super into a WH and logged it off for all time there.
---
Well, I guess I won't tell you about my TEST alts then either...
---
eve was coded by people taking copious amounts of hallucinogenics , one of the original coders wrote so much code but never commented it, to this day they are still trying to unscramble the code that he bodged to work. Acid is great
---
Incoming ambulation guys, I can feel it.
---
I get that. But you are with RC now, so our fights with you are planned as fights against the whole of RC. Have to be. - It's kind of unfortunate, because I know you guys are in a TZ that is not really compatible with either RC or Provi. So almost all timers in this conflict will come out in an awkward TZ for you guys. 
---
I honestly don't understand why you guys chose to go with RC on this. It pretty much guarantees that you'll never get any good fights, since Provi basically has no presence in your TZ, and any timer worth alarm clocking in for will also be worth 3rd partying on. Unless you guys particularly enjoy reinforcing sov structures uncontested? - At least TRC has that one corp that you could skirmish with if you had stayed the way you were.
---
The best explanation I've heard is that RC promised to help you out against Snuffed... but you guys can't seriously think they'll make any significant difference against them? Snuffed outnumber all you guys so severely in supers that RC would never even show up to a proper fight with them. (Not that I blame them; I wouldn't either.) - Take the Camal Keepstar thing, for example. It literally got saved last minute by Vily - of all people - because he was having a mood-swing at Snuffed that day. RC could do nothing to stop them.
---
You misunderstand my friend. NOBODY wants your space because it is shit space. We entosis for the LOLs.
---
But hey, you keep doing what you are doing. Clearly you are playing in the best space you can get and since it isn't Stain, I guess you are doing something right. :)
---
Or salvage drones didn't have to wait for ships to be wrecks to process them. Give me metal scraps only on hull damage, no salvage until then.
---
I was not online at the time nor was I in the fleet. I had real life to attend (serious note: death in the family) so I guess you got me there.
---
Like I said earlier - good job for Provi finally winning something. But please don't embarrass yourselves by claiming it is a normal thing or spinning it to be like you guys are awesome or something. I mean, now that blackout is over, have your nullbears started returning?
---
That is brilliant. CVA needs more F1 pushers like you!
---
please read rule 4 in the screenshot
---
I think the bigger factor was they lost the guy who programmed the tournament tool and haven't dedicated anyone to getting it fully working again since then. It's just not a high priority for them.
---
Well, when the "moronic thing to do" is to run the content at all, that's a pretty good indicator it's fucking broken and needs changed.
---
[deleted]
---
I agree that's probably the biggest part of it. However, I can't help but think that maybe are slimming down they're dev time for other things or just cutting hours / staff.
---
Blackout was better for the game in 2-3 years. CCP couldn't wait that long because players threw a fit.  Bots, players with a dozen rorquals, and people who played eve just to rat unsubbed. That number of accounts dropping was enough to scare CCP into letting the game slowly die.
---
In this case Loot Fairy rolled one dice instead of two hundred
---
&gt; Not really that exceptional
---
73 bil dropped
---
What a stupid idea, let's just ruin one of the major parts of Eve that sets it apart from other games, because you know it's 2019 and everything has to be equal and fair!
---
It's a lot of money, sure. But it all came down to a single roll. It's not like the Loot Fairy rolled for every single item and let them all survive. It was All or Nothing, is my point.
---
Sure it's still a 50/50 but I don't think a 73b drop is not exceptional
---
I came here regularly to make sure I'm not overdosing on fairy dust
---
Ask yourself why you want to mine. No, I'm not going to try to convince you to stop. I just mean that the ideal skill order for you changes depending on *why* you're mining.
---
Example: If you enjoy mining in highsec after you come home from work, relaxing and listening to the hum of the mining lasers, upgrade to a procurer or retriever immediately. It's not good isk, but they make a good hum and look pretty cool in the ore belt. It's probably worth getting the ability to fit a T2 mining upgrade in a low slot, and it's *definitely* a good idea to get the skills for a T2 adaptive invuln field. Tank your miners! Especially in highsec!
---
If, on the other hand, you're trying to make isk efficiently, never train the barge. Instead, train gas harvesting and day-trip into wormholes to harvest the valuable gas there. This is a much more active process (if you're ninja-ing, which you are) and requires a bit of setup for each trip, but the income is significantly higher than a barge mining ore.
---
Did you enjoy flying your Rorqual fleet? If so, come back and fly it. If not, come back and *do something else*. Nobody is forcing you to get a recon.
---
(Ok, a corp might try to force you to get a recon, but remember *you can leave a corp*. *That's allowed*.)
---
FUCKING YES
---
Sometimes we even get 4 person gangs
---
  You're hard to please
---
Don't worry the CODE guys got the 10 billion drop in Sivala.
---
&gt;Loot fairy has been oh so kind
---
  Hey, I try to please &lt;3
---
sir we dont do pet status all or nothing no  **inbetween** :P
---
no, and neither does windows.
---
I don't know how I missed that - good eye!
---
I still want the STLs :)
---
What about to drop titans on solo battleships around black rise?
---
But that isn't a solution to the fact the letter of the law is that only pilots under 31 days of age are protected. You are 100% free to engage anyone that doesn't qualify as a rookie, even in a rookie system.
---
I doubt it, though you never know. The gates are simply too close to each other, and the range from the furthest landing spots from them on the station is maybe 5000m? Even if the station is expanded double/triple it's current diameter, they will still land on those couple degrees. 
---
Alternatively, spacing the gates a couple AU apart might make it a bit more painful? Don't recall CCP ever moving a gate however.
---
Returning to Eve after a long time. I rejoined a couple of years back and I have a dedicated combat character on one side (Really fun to fly battlecruisers and go pew pew)   
---
But I have my old Mining/Industrialist character still around. I enjoy mining but I kinda wanna make a bit of coin. What other paths do I have in mining so I'm not just sitting around strip mining stuff in high sec? Could I outfit a venture or something to go deeper and come back with more profits?   
---
Additionally the thing I haven't fully explored thus far has been exploration. Any tips? It seems... easier now.
---
&gt; If they want to improve the current situation they could start by balancing the fucking game. Adding more overpowered stuff to offset other overpowered stuff isn't balancing, it just leaves everything else further behind. But whatever. Bring out the Trig dread. At least that'll sell some injectors.
---
This is the kind of stuff that makes me feel like it's not worth playing the game.  I needed the NPE for the first... 30 hours maybe.  After that I just wanted to be relevant.
---
There's been several people caught doing it in incursions just over the last couple month. 
---
No one gives a fuck, you could setup hundreds of alpha now train them for a month or two. Then do whatever you want to do and as soon as one gets banned you swap to the next.
---
Sell it. Reason : Value of books, in your case the book of cpital industrial, and the valiue of capital ships, at least. Normally rorqual pilotos always sell, maybe delay some days, but are of the few who have a surplus of the skillpoints value.
---
Are you selling the Ore you guys mined in P7? We'll do you a good deal?
---
&gt; First used old T1 prices, then compared to new T2 and T3 prices.
---
He's comparing the cost of fits people used to fight with to the cost of fits people fight with now.  It's not a bait and switch you just missed the point.
---
are you going to explain why my ideas are bad? You can tell me to stop posting as much as you want, but it doesn’t make you any more right
---
YASSS MISSSY
---
YIKES #1
---
he should have had a travel permit
---
[removed]
---
Also ACL Contacts, sharing contacts between alts over multiple corps would be awesome.
---
Thanks!
---
Oh damn I need to try this game:o
---
Vote, to make it better.
---
God damn loot fairy was drunk as shit.
---
Nice
---
But is it? *really*?
---
Someone else took it, I'd have to ask.
---
/me rolls eyes.
---
admit it, you laughed.
---
It’s not that it’s that if you bring a BS fleet into enemy space you instadie to all the caps
---
No that's just as dumb. Yellow safety will still allow loot griefing and suspect baiting against noob, while protecting non-noobs from ganks.
---
The rookie griefing policy (https://support.eveonline.com/hc/en-us/articles/203209712-Rookie-Griefing) only prohibits griefing new players, older players are free game even in noob systems.
---
ccp is trying to kill eve
---
Dead?
---
lol take this upvote
---
Yeah fore sure, but that seems to be their explanation for not getting anything really done lately. 
---
CCP games system devs: "it takes too much time / its complicated because \*reasons\* / we thought about it but could not find a way " 
---
Still every month there are a lot of ui fixes / gfx fixes, somehow there is enough time for that? You would think that at least balancing some ships by tweaking the numbers would be easy enough (just small stuff like 10% less/more of x stat).
---
uh ok, that kinda misses the point though.
---
mining is mining
---
Its good fucking advice,  take it you mong.
---
Your point is that HACs especially the muninn are over represented right?
---
No, go away.
---
It would be completely dead. This sub is already dying slowly. There aren't near as many posts as there used to be. (Especially since the mods got anal about posting memes/propaganda)
---
To be fair unless you are deep into a war that is active or politics in eve you won’t be on this reddit much whilst your really actively playing
---
I used to run a Corp an alliance and was heavily into pvp I was too busy having fun playing the game to lurk on reddit 
---
I take a break from eve for 6 months or so then come back, I still love the game but can also hate it at the same time and suddenly I’m on reddit in my off time
---
My gut instinct is that if your really having fun in the game  like I used to you don’t have the time or inclination to come on reddit and complain or shitpost.
---
Just my opinion would be nice if I was wrong though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
?
---
Read that as "Imp down" at first. Is it legal to be disappointed by the loot fairy saying yes this hard?
---
How did he get catched?
---
Should be on thingyverse. And if not there is a github with all ships and other models converted to STL files.
---
Though with less detail as ingame, as they use .. bump mapping or whatever the technology is call.
---
and one slot for doomsday
---
[https://github.com/Drewzar/eve-stls](https://github.com/Drewzar/eve-stls)
---
I was thinking more in lines with, after they take player owned null sof, they start anchoring their own various structures as they clear out all player owned ones. Turning entire systems to PVE content. But think about it, their response fleets of ships can shred capitals with their disintigrators. So people soloing them in supercarriers/titans? forget it. But they dont rebuild what they lost, no infinite pools here no.
---
Acl communities. You make one ACL group and then chat channel, bookmarks and hangars are based on that. If you remove or add a person / corp / alliance from that group he does not have access to the channels, bookmarks and hangars.
---
Kinda like a corp, but more loose. Maybe even give access to other ACL groups? And set standing to ACL groups.
---
I think they did actually. But I suspect it's client side so you could still get around it with VMs or cloud instances.
---
and here i am proud of my black hole collection i made by putting microwave ovens into microwave ovens
---
Then how are we supposed to give afk miners heart attacks with catalysts full of fireworks?
---
Hey. That's my alt. Give my stuff back
---
&gt;Nobody wants "good fights" while they're playing
---
Fixed it for you
---
Eve is already the most monitized game i kniw cause you can purchase anything (even alliances lol)
---
may the blackout rest in piss :)
---
Well if you use Linux you don't need a VPN, can't recognize the alpha vs omega, my buddy found this out, funny we were playing and it was months after alphas had been around and he said wow kinda crazy you can log into alphas and omegas at the same time and I said, well you can't. Then we realized it was his OS (Linux)
---
Aye let's gate camp in caps we're surely good at this game
---
wormholer btw
---
&gt;It's now the age of acceptance.
---
Looking at the MER it looks like more like the age of exodus. I wonder what game(s) people are moving on to.
---
KAST eye luv ewe
---
Hacs are in a balanced place right now yep nothing to see here.
---
The carrier uses fighters to decloak BRs and other haulers trying to mwd/cloak trick. Essentially the same way as decloaking with something like a sabre, except fighters go more than 4x as fast.
---
post the fit and what it is for
---
RMT right?
---
Make the Eris great again
---
Having fun, that can be anything from PVP to theft. Including losses.
---
The T1 exploration frigates won't be able to fight a lot especially if they are fitted for exploration. So the drones don't change much.
---
In general I'd say accept that you die from time to time if you do exploration in wormholes. You can reduce the rate though. Dscan! A lot! Also many people are friendly enough and you can ask them what you could do better after they killed you.
---
Well, it's worth considering *why* Muninns (and cruiser hulls in general) are so good, because imo this is a symptom rather than the underlying disease: capital &amp; supercapital proliferation.
---
For Muninns (and other alpha doctrines), I would put the blame almost entirely on the proliferation of Force Auxiliary logistics and to a lesser degree the rising number of Zarmazds. Traditional Logi suffer from low HP relative to the fleet and susceptibility to electronic warfare, but none of this affects FAX, and Zarms have a very high EHP and a tiny sig.
---
To counter FAX, there are basically two options:
---
* A capital escalation with at least 10 Dreads or a few Titans to shoot through the Triage faxes. Considering the number of caps you actually need to commit, this is rarely a viable option unless you're *sure* that you win the capital escalation;
---
* Alpha doctrines which ignore the FAX reps entirely, like Muninns, Machs, Lokis, etc.
---
As for cruiser hulls, again this really comes down to capital proliferation. Battleships are a lot of fun: they hit hard, they have a bunch of utility slots, ...and they get absolutely annihilated by bosons, carriers, HAW dreads, and supers. HACs have ADCs, are manoeuvrable enough to haze fighters, and can get off grid if they get cap blobbed.
---
Essentially, if CCP want the Muninn to be less popular, they don't need to touch the Muninn at all, they just need to fix capital-subcapital balance so that dreads and faxes are far less oppressive in subcap fights and have counterplay which isn't "drop a bigger capital blob".
---
Unfortunately I can only upvote this once.
---
But from what I have learnt from reddit is that the “RRREEEEEEEEE something something broken CCPLZ” changes every few weeks and most people here have mild Austim.
---
Also trust yourself not to leave MTUs behind in all three Abyssal rooms.  I believe in you.  You should only need one.  ;)
---
Ccpls nerf carriers
---
I have the app installed on my iOS device and everything!
---
nah tnx. I'm not the type of person to buy a 3D printer just so I can score some fake reddit points by printing something game related...
---
I’m not sure how you get “going downhill” from “doubling revenue each of the last 2 years”
---
This is what reddit is.  Complete idiots making shit up as they go linking an article to appear smart because they know the morons on here won’t read it.
---
I think most of the really active toxic asshats who post here have quit the game long ago
---
Unspoken are making Sacs a thing do there's that!
---
&gt;**Killed an estimated 2.6B**
---
&gt;**Lost under 40M**
---
If I were you I'd try and lose that mindset quick if you don't want to be yet another ragey but risk averse FC and add to the cancer that already rots the game from the inside out
---
Not true I jump on reddit every time I go for a shit........ so ..... .. yeah I'm shitting right now lol
---
Imho the problem is the abundance of materials - HACs should be good, yes, but they also should get expensive rather quickly when replacing. Atm you dont see much action in price due to conflicts around as there is more than enough supply of both HACs and materials to make them.
---
Classic r/eve when?
---
Fax  alt is now a Recon alt.
---
Join Goons, we show you how to mine!
---
I have recently changed to a new PC. Eve was running fine on my old one, and for a while on the new one.
---
Now, the launcher appears not to open. However, it is open, Discord detects Eve as running, and I've been able to get to tranquility through the options in the taskbar, although I get the message "Please log in through the launcher" when I try to log in through the server list.
---
When I hover over the Eve icon on the taskbar, it appears to show a blank window. I've done the obvious stuff like uninstall/reinstall and restart/shutdown etc, but feel like I'm missing a setting or something else obvious that would make me able to actually see the launcher (I've tried cascading windows etc too in case it was somehow hidden off screen, as it seems to gain priority when clicked)
---
Any suggestions other than "Can I have your stuff" appreciated :P
---
I approve of this message.....
---
Do a flip
---
It's risk *averse* you fuckwit
---
Probably just 90% less 'krabs are shit, pvp is the shit' posts and more 'what is this thing I found while exploring, what damage type do I use against X'
---
I thought we learnt this lesson already, they'll just sit at the login screen and ree. You should need an NPC kill to post
---
First CCP goes pay-to-win with injectors, now some in the sub want to go pay-to-win for karma. When will it end?
---
So nothing would change then, damn.
---
&gt; sabre, except fighters go more than 4x as fast.
---
that's just ridiculous
---
&gt; Who the fuck cares what they had?
---
Literally anyone who wants to do more than immediately get alpha’d.  Getting ganked like you overloaded an industrial in Niarja isn’t a fun fight.
---
It's obviously just HACs chosen.
---
Any chance we could start a weekly newbro fit thread. Where we showcase a fit and talk about what it's good against etc. (Even if it ends up being only a few comments). Or something similar like a t1 amarr frigate thread (where you discuss a few fits).

I like coming here but there isn't always a lot of helpful information anymore.
---
I started not playing eve in around 2006. I was most actively not playing eve around 2010 and I had major spurt of not playing during WWB. However since the middle of 2018 my levels of not playing has dropped off significantly. I'm lucky these days to not play Eve one day a month.
---
No, I'm saying that the counter to real-time warnings is to make it so that they're not actionable when you get the information.  In other words, the solution to it being too easy to bail from a site at any moment when you get spooked is to make it so that you can't always do that.
---
Imagine if kspace anomalies actually tackled you with something other than frigates!  One of the interesting differences between wormhole ganks and kspace ganks is that, after the gank is complete, the gankers frequently have to figure out how they're going to clear tackle, because something's almost always pointing you in a wormhole site.
---
tfw you are such an irrelevant region people thought you were the next least relevant region
---
See ya around 6 ish :)
---
&gt; Unfortunately I can only upvote this once.
---
Make some more alts.
---
not giving a shit about your dumb autopilot and how well it works
---
come up with a way to demonstrate it without making the bot if you feel the need to
---
i can think of quite a few depending on how much work do you want to put in
---
Tbh this is what killed this sub more than anything else. Took it too seriously and forgot the game was supposed to be fun.
---
Id be down to help. How many is there to shoot at?
---
Wait, propaganda is not allowed here anymore? Why am I even still subscribed to this hellhole?
---
This submission is so full of disclaimers, qualifying statements, and weasel words that it's hard to read.
---
I can live without the shitty opinions of people who dont even play the game.
---
"Provi and RC form...". I think you forgot to mention the TEST Munnin fleet that was in 9uy also after you batphone them. At least this time was TEST , last week was INIT...
---
The Oracle has a use again????
---
I'd rather leave that until a last resort, but I haven't I must admit.
---
suggestion: make a tutorial that doesnt just funnel you directly into the most boring content in the game (missions), and make it before you release the alpha update (oops)
---
Nice try CCP
---
it's almost like the content of a message board for a specific topic sucks... when that specific topic sucks?! my god....
---
You know, eve is still like that, I've been playing eve for almost 4 years and only really do subcap stuff. there's things to fight, it just wont get spoon fed to you. You have to undock, get out there and go roaming around and find something to shoot.
---
If you need 3-6 points of scram, why not fit 3-6 points of scram?
---
imagine you are sitting in a board room full of your contemporaries for the weekly conference call, where you will discuss various topic concerning the video game project you are working on.  suddenly, Stan from marketing interrupts the meeting by standing up, pointing his finger in the air and saying "Excuse me everyone, e-excuse me, but I'd like to read you a post that I found on reddit this morning"  
---
And then you actually had to listen to this post dictated out loud, no way to avoid it, just had to sit there and endure it.  how much would you want to die?
---
It neither survives nor dies until observed
---
Rore Kapelle is always positive towards pvp.
---
you know thats what many of the people who played the game said a few years back about a different group of people
---
A freighter shouldn't be able to solo escape a concerted effort to kill it.
---
Works both ways
---
I'm so incredibly touched. I thought the part where vindi was "concerned" they could form enough to create TIDI was especially cute. Perhaps the sheer force of Aezekiel's ego could create that TIDI for you.
---
\o/
---
Indeed
---
are you trying to get the only ship that works nerfed? delete this ffs
---
You guys repeatedly batphone Horde &amp; NC then cry when we call in our friends. You know what they say about people in glass houses?
---
This list is HACs only. Loki is above Muninn on overall usage.
---
i love you
---
Meh not really. Putting this aside, they hard deny content in the region just like test. They’ll blob a solo cruiser with 40 dudes gatecamping consistently. I don’t really get a 40 dude form up for that but lol
---
"I've been to this dead-end system a dozen times and it's always empty. This time should be no diff—HOLY FUCK A GATECAMP! OK think! I just need to cloak/MWD and I'm invuln—DEACLOAKED! Oh for the love of spod!  But if I can only burn back to gate and the safety of highs—NOOOOOOO! I died. I died! And they got everything!"
---
Good fight!
---
I haven’t seen a vagabond in the wild for weeks and weeks.
---
Nice video.
---
I mean... That would be the dream. Unified inventories between your own accounts. No more contracting, no more searching for x module in assets..
---
I do however think I'll stay as a dream. Unfortunaly!
---
I had a ton on fun. The scouting team was exceptional
---
Do polarized Oracle or domi with polarized lasers. Use t1 crystals
---
I love you back, of course.
---
The only way to mine in any real sense is to multibox. A way around that was the rorq, but due to CCP being unable to design games and pvpers unable to handle one ship, it's been nerfed into near oblivion. 
---
Rocks gotta come from somewhere, preferably without botting... but then again roughly 50% of your ore for pvp ships comes from botting.
---
Hmmm, the top 7 days list looks nothing like that  [https://i.imgur.com/VYOtMEU.png](https://i.imgur.com/VYOtMEU.png)
---
damn you're right. upvote!
---
I should be able to kill things and they shouldn’t be able to warp off when i come for them
---
Hey! New player, I've done the tutorial, and I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do. Like, everyone talks about all these different jobs, but how do you get to the chance to do them?
---
Atleast I have a job and dont live off my wife.
---
This Is Eve 2019 version - everything same except you replace subcaps with capitals and supercapitals.
---
Can someone explain why there are multiple comments angry at this persons post? Am I missing some sort of background information?
---
This would rule and could be doable.
---
I mean, I kinda get the changes they made to Rorqs but I think it was a bit heavy-handed maybe. Honestly, though, I don't have experience with Rorq mining.
---
Just keep trying.  You'll get better at it.
---
Faction Antimatter XL.
---
Your contemporaries must suck. Who even reads reddit posts out loud?
---
:D
---
Join a corp that can show you these things. For a first corp I would suggest brave, or eve university.
---
Other playstyles are also riddled with this ""CCP Should cater to my playstyle"" issue. For me the big problem is that this is turning a harsh PvP focused game into PvE one with PvP elements. I get that PvE is needed to fund PvP but having more and more safety means more and more people doing what you are doing , more and more your playstyle being devalued and more and more time needed to make up for the same value it had before
---
Ah, I'm already in one, unfortunately most of the corps say new player friendly, but never have anyone on at the right time for me
---
Hi hello
---
This may be one of the most positive things anyone from this game has ever said to me. I think I have a tear. Thanks buddy.
---
The multiboxing thing I agree with. I multibox. This is my hobby and I like it, so it's no skin off my nose.
---
Weren't they fixing it with something like diminishing return of reps of faxes or something? Dunno if that's allready a thing or not
---
Back when you could gamble while talking shit in local, and rifters were worth a damn.
---
I've also been a HS miner for quite some time. I know what you're talking about. Keep going :)
---
Are any of your posts ever not shit?  Can you not just shut the fuck up and be happy about being able to mine in nullsec with almost no risk at all?
---
r/eve deserves to die if shitposts were all that was keeping it alive.
---
abyssal farmers could abuse it
---
Best post I've read in a while. Up vote city.
---
No, this is just the true endgame; posting on r/Eve and never logging in, but keeping that skill queue going. This is where the bittervets go for endgame content.
---
I agree with a lot of that.
---
As a former military member with PTSD, the stress triggers that come with ship-to-ship PVP actually causes me anxiety to the point it's not enjoyable for me. I don't know why, but it just does. I don't dislike others living for straight PVP in this game, though. That's what the core mechanic of the game has been since the beginning.  
---
I also don't want it to become a PVE game with PVP elements. I like the fact that I can get forced to PVP without consent at any given moment. I agree with the assessment that more and more safety means more people devaluing the mining playstyle in particular. I don't necessarily believe it should be the most dangerous profession in-game, but it shouldn't get a leg up on other playstyles altogether, which is what a LOT of high sec miners want.
---
Even though I'm a miner, I'm firmly fucking down with the HTFU mentality that has raged in this game since 2003. That's what Eve really is and what it's all about.
---
People hate on injectors but injectors are an *okay* part of the game. There needs to be a small limit imposed on them though. But it's nice to get my dread trained in 3 months instead of waiting 7.
---
it's always marketing trying to over compensate if you ask me. probably because they feel guilty about sitting around all day not doing a damn thing.
---
im killing a raitaru right now solo for the first time just to test citadel killing
---
in a "max dps t2" https://i.imgur.com/TwHwZSK.png (my alt have okey but not perfect skills) Leshak you get 2730 dps whit 4 ogre's at max rampup
---
the shield was all gone in 10 min then 10min more for the armor, the hull have 4,8m hp insted of the 1,2m shield hp + 1,2m armor hp so it will take 40 min for me to kill next week
---
ofc the ship and ammo cost alot and if a wartarget comes it will die, so a normal bs or oracal will work, just abit slower
---
I feel like so much of the story is missing here... I am left in suspence..
---
There are two kinds of posters on /r/Eve: the ones who have seen the ugly side of CCP and been burned, and the ones who desperately believe that if everybody stops talking about it things will get better.
---
You should try something other than krabbing and pressing f1 in a 100 man fleet.  You might learn what it's like to be in a roaming gang trying to get reasonable fights out of chest beating cowards.  More importantly you wouldn't make retarded comments like this anymore.
---
Yeah that really doesnt affect triage though. That's for 40+ fax.
---
CSM run? 
---
(God no, that's a joke.)
---
I'm pretty sure this is some 400 IQ two-tiered CODE. bait in disguise...
---
This is r/Eve. That's why.
---
I like how you get downvoted for saying 10km/s tackle fighters might be ridiculous. Stay classy /r/eve
---
The best way would be to turn them into a multiplier on training speed rather than a lump sum of SP.
---
lol no way. you should do it \o/
---
I'm not a miner and I hate other miners.
---
New faction capitals! Just what the game needs.
---
I like lump sum of sp. I keep 20k saved just incase there's some random thing I can't fly and I needed it trained.
---
Fake news
---
I see them quite frequently, I also fly the somewhat frequently.
---
this guy knows what is up
---
I am also mining in high sec several times a week, and I agree with you. Yes, I have been ganked, so what, it happens. If there was zero risk it would definitely be too boring to play the game.
---
Always enjoy your vids. Keep em coming
---
'Miner' is a catch-all term that embodies a spirit of cowardice and entitlement. It doesn't matter whether he mines ore, gas, goo, NPCs or explo cans. A miner is satisfied with nothing less than complete safety and predictability. A miner can be many years old but still identify as a newb, because he has never learned how to play. A miner demands solo gameplay and to be left alone. He despises anything that interrupts his routine. 
---
Old, long-in-the-tooth miners are continually lobbying for nerfs to make the game more predictable and easier to automate, and they always do it in the name of new players. They'll tell you that every new player requires a year or two in highsec to 'learn the ropes and get established', and that during this crucial incubation stage he must be left alone and never be made to experience hardship, lest he quit. The miner's true motivation is to hide behind the shield of new players and be the first to exploit any benefits they are granted. An old miner will take a break for a few months and then return and claim newbie status all over again.
---
Miners hate other players, especially the other miners. Miners hate EVE.
---
Exactly!
---
It's okay. I still love you. &lt;3
---
That’s what I thought but was trying to keep an open mind lol.
---
&gt; Imperium
---
&gt; not a miner
---
I don't know if I believe you.
---
this made me laugh, i'm not an Eve player btw i just lurk around here
---
What does a daily standup at CCP look like?
---
"Ok time for our bicentennial sprint review"
---
Newp, not at all actually.
---
Again, I LIKE the fact that CODE. and organizations like it exist. They teach players, both old and new, to keep on their toes. They also keep shit moving. As an industrialist in high-sec, I make a shit load of ISK off of Catalysts, Procurers, and appropriate modules/rigs to fit your fucking ship. THEY ARE GOOD FOR BUSINESS.   
---
I don't like getting ganked anymore than anyone else. Now I know, however, if I get ganked it's something I can learn from and adapt, which is also one of the core mechanics to the game design in EVE.  
---
I mean, fuck, some Goonies ganked one of my ships with some BPOs I purchased about two weeks ago. I didn't bitch one second when I found myself in a pod when I came back to the computer. My sin? I decided to autopilot while I took a shit. I actually laughed when I came back and sat down. In my head, I said, "That was fucking dumb of you, you know that, right?" And I did. And I learned. Sometimes I have to learn multiple times before I get it, but I learned.
---
inti Pog
---
I mean being able to buy a skill simplifies things for new players, and ensures they don't get ripped off before they figure stiff out. 
---
Also the blackout was a stupid idea.
---
And the other one too !
---
Shit post. Literally no one is as saying what you claim.
---
I think I'd rather punch a momma bear in the cunt and try to escape from her, TBH. :D
---
Apparently I need to join unspoken. Make sac's great!
---
How about 2 pvp kills not alts
---
Less "capital proliferation" and more "faxes are insanely OP"
---
This wouldn't be a problem with the old triage carriers
---
You only see that change for large fax drops in titan fights.
---
I used to see them solo in some places. They're a beauty in their natural environment.
---
You can overcome this with the displace modifier in blender but need the UV map intact
---
do it man
---
To be honest, a lot of the nullsec miners act just the same way. Just a higher pitched squeak.
---
I wasnt involved in this fight. If you read that as pissy, youre misinterpreting my tone. Its merely a statement of fact-- provi bloc pilots have an extra layer of autism you just dont see on other alliance pilots.
---
How is pressing "print" a hobby? I print documents sometimes but I don't call that a hobby... The only difference is your printer spews hot plastic or whatnot and my one has ink in it... And finally, just out of curiosity, what part of my post seemed "angry" to you?
---
I agree
---
Credit card management -5
---
Agree tbh. Also personally I think the sub requiring users to be authenticated like someone posted earlier would be a great idea.
---
I'm tired of hearing shit from people who don't even play the game.
---
https://i.imgur.com/hIwyaqj.jpg
---
There really isn't a whole lot of difference between any of them. T1, Meta, and T2 are all basically the same. They're significantly cheaper than the Faction and Officer though. So if you want to squeeze that little bit extra from a module, without breaking the bank to buy one with some guy's name on it, then you'll go with the T2.
---
Especially if you're flying a Daredevil / Vigilant / Vindicator. They have a ship bonus to Web effect. ~~If your skills allow you to double the effect, would you rather double 55 to 110, or double 60 to 120?~~
---
As for comparing them to Scrams, the reason they get a range bonus is b/c there is no functional difference between them otherwise. A 2 point Scram is a 2 point Scram whether it's T1 or T2. It's not until you get into Faction that you see a 3 point Scram. So the only improvement between T1 and T2 could be the range.
---
#Miners hate him
---
Use this trick to make all the spod you could ever want.
---
&gt; Probably the same on the Tengu, ctrl-click on overview or in space on the bracket itself can help with avoiding that
---
loooool, I rewatched this moment multiple times, read logs, watched for ECM Burst animation and had no idea what was happening...
---
Now when you said it I just watched it and this damn button did become "unlock" when target get locked :D  I should keep using overview!
---
Thank you!
---
Make Citadel tethering and asset safety features entosisable, if the structure is reinforced and then entosised the features are switched off until it gets repaired fully, otherwise just make it require onlining for a few hours...
---
This will make a way to create engagements rather than just having people dock up in an invulnerable structure...
---
CCP solution - make structures completely immune to damage and able to apply perfectly to any shiptype with a single sized missile doing fixed 50% of the ships hp in damage per hit... also citadel fighters now benefit from tether and can no longer be attacked while in tether range, lel...
---
I'm not a goon.
---
&gt;all of a sudden
---
Uhhh no
---
Zealot and Deimos are pretty decent at solo pvp.
---
Model painting is a hobby, making models has been considered a hobby....for a long time unless you dont rememeber the good ol days of assembling models and painting them or just didnt have an interest in it.
---
Your text conveys a "direct inferiority" approach which comes from a aspect of anger or disdain to not really understanding what your talking about.
---
But hey thank you for the conversation but im not gonna engage anymore lol thank you for your opinion though
---
Very Respectfully
---
I don't get it: I've been lurking this shit hole since it started and there are very, very few old names here at any point.
---
For example, let's say CCP discovers that a ton of bots use Leaseweb. Leaseweb does not offer (as far as I can tell) residential/home internet access. Do you think CCP should allow these IPs to connect to EVE?
---
I’m think of making a small cata fleet to pop the packrat and magpie for killmails
---
'Miner' is a state of mind and an outlook that has very little to do with one's chosen profession. By my definition, you're not a miner but a fully-fledged capsuleer who happens to mine. Fine post, by the way.
---
&gt;In other words, the solution to it being too easy to bail from a site at any moment when you get spooked is to make it so that you can't always do that.
---
I agree, but the free intel has to go.
---
These reactionary fanbos are getting even worse than the FFXIV ones, and that's saying something
---
Sure some instances are cancer. But if you are new to the game then you need injectors or a good way to train things.
---
thats not true, you mine a shit ton of wormholer salt

Makes you wonder how people even started playing without them.
---
There has been a dramatic expansion of negativity beyond the traditional salt we routine experience here.
---
Probably more healthy then the game ayy
---
O, never mind, you’ve convinced me
---
Thank you
---
It's OP's writing style. He's expecting to be flamed. Half of his prose is self-effacing and ever-so-tolerant placation, and it's obnoxious.
---
Capital cap boosters are a big problem for sure. How CCP thought it'd be a good idea to keep triage Ewar-immune and THEN make them almost invulnerable to neuts is beyond me.
---
I took a hiatus right before the capital rework and I'm practically speechless how insanely powerful they are now. Before, triage carriers could tank, what, 12k dps? And were vulnerable to concentrated heavy neuts. Now you need 50 BS just to begin breaking a FAX tank and those neuts will barely touch it. Don't even get me started on HAW dreads.
---
And all these ships, after insurance, cost about as much as a moderately-blinged pirate BS. Absolute madness.
---
Of course by now, everyone's used to how broken caps are that any attempt to bring them back down to a balanced state will be seen as "unfair" by the users of said caps.
---
capital-sized smartbombs when
---
eve used to be fun
---
This would be an improvement, yes.
---
I agree and then they sit and complain when they die to a roaming gang or nuet which everyone else has seen in Intel for the last 15 mins but they keep greed Mining then say no one come to help me pvpers don’t care.... I’m sorry do you switch out to your pvp ship when nuets come into system. No you  just dock and refuse to help 
---
Breathe I feel better now
---
Yep, Africanized rats will pop pretty much any sub-cap in under a minute.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
D-scan the system and if there is an FOB (Forward operating base) for these types of rats in the system or surrounding systems, you may die rather quickly.
---
Great job dictors🙂
---
&gt;would you rather double 55 to 110, or double 60 to 120?
---
110 certainly, the 120% web is causing them to move backwards twice as fast!
---
No no no, that means they start moving towards you at 20%, it's like a tractor beam! =)
---
Actual AAR? Whose stuff was it anyway?
---
&gt;absurdly long
---
Look if you want instant gratification that makes everything feel meaningless there's plenty of MMORPGs like that on the market already
---
No, ita just you.
---
Actually only problem with the code is most of the time they are the reason new players to quit, other than that they are bunch of useless Hs campers who can exist in New Eden as expected even though I don't like them and enjoy hunting them.
---
Just my imaginary reconstruction of events. System: [Pakkonen](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Lonetrek/Pakkonen#sec) (0.4), Location: Stargate (Isikano). He jumped into lowsec without a scout.
---
 wHy i eNJoY eVe
---
&gt;Seeded skillbooks are available all over the place. And they cost X. Skills purchased through the Character Sheet cost more in exchange for saving you the hassle of having to fly around and get the books. 
---
Not always. Plenty of times I've checked jita Vs the character sheet and it's been cheaper. 
---
&gt;So the opportunity for ripping people off, lies solely on CCP for charging extra on direct purchases.
---
No, if I have a character in null, I can a) get ripped off buying skills, b) jump clone to jita and wait a day to be home again, or c) buy from the character sheet for a decent price. As a noob I often saw skills that had hiked up prices, before I even went to null.
---
&gt;And Blackout was awesome. The appeal of Null Sec is being out from under anyone's rule but your own. You get to claim a portion of space and call it yours
---
The appeal of nullsec is whatever the fuck I want it to be tbh.
---
&gt;. Letting the Local window tell you when there are invaders is lazy, not to mention bot'able
---
Bots still ran in the blackout though. As far as I read, no local was client side. And I use intel channels primarily, people cry about those enough though. I just cannot be fucked playing a game where spamming d scan is a necessity. If they rework that mechanic, I may like it. Since they haven't, I don't. It has fuck all to do with skill, I don't want RSI when I could be having fun. I don't live in a wh for a reason.
---
&gt;If you wanted to get out from under the safety net of High and Low, then provide for your own safety.
---
Oh we do, don't worry
---
Yeah but Eve is Eve.
---
at least im not a back stabbing little bitch
---
TL;DR: you do not hate *miners*, you hate players bitching about the game being too hard and wrote a summary why miners should stop bitching.
---
I agree, but the title is misleading.
---
Where do you find these NPC Soyito at?
---
&gt;If having fun means being an asshat then maybe there is something wrong with you.
---
Who the fuck are you to determine what other people have fun doing? Does everybody need to embody Hello Kitty in every aspect of their life? Online and off?
---
You know how I know your cool? You're one of the cool dudes that uses autism casually as a way to refer to someone in a video game. Might as well fire up your caps lock with it and hit the cruise control for cool.
---
&gt; Not always. Plenty of times I've checked Jita Vs the character sheet and it's been cheaper.
---
That's b/c Jita isn't one of the seeded markets. Someone flew the books there and posted them at a markup. Hoping that other people are too lazy to go find the books elsewhere for cheaper, and will buy them while they're in Jita buying other stuff.
---
&gt; No, if I have a character in null, I can a) get ripped off buying skills, b) jump clone to jita and wait a day to be home again, or c) buy from the character sheet for a decent price. As a noob I often saw skills that had hiked up prices, before I even went to null.
---
Yep, same deal. Someone flew the books out to Null and posted them hoping for a little profit.
---
&gt; Bots still ran in the blackout though. As far as I read, no local was client side.
---
Yes, there were reports of people finding messages in the Logs. And if the Bot makers were smart enough to reference those instead of just referencing the Local window itself (which is easier, hence most did), then some Bots could still function. But a great many of them were lazy and only watched Local, which is why they died. And a great many lazy Players watched Local instead of Logs, or instead of deploying forces to monitor their Gates, and they died too.
---
&gt; Oh we do (provide for your own safety), don't worry
---
Glad to hear it! =) There were WAY too many Null care bears who stopped playing b/c they were afraid of the Boogeyman. If you and yours are willing and able to defend yourselves even if Local doesn't warn you ahead of time, then I congratulate you.
---
Yeah, it is a bit click-baity. Not intentional and it's already out there like it is, so I'll leave it. But yeah, I agree with you.
---
Only dogs can hear them
---
They need to go play cookie clicker
---
We did this when blackout started (along with zkill and dotlan).
---
It was pretty aweful to be honest, especially for those of us who are not using those sites for shitposting, but to take a short look at what is happening in EVE on their way to work or while having a break.
---
There is for mains. You can see current SP remaining on current skill and time remaining.
---
hell yea my dude, keep on fighting the good fight. Crashing into everything is how content is born
---
If you want to look at the most useless T2 item then look at the T2 MWD.
---
good stuff my dude! fc'ing is so hard for me, im glad to see others picking it up and leading the way for other dudes
---
This sounds like something involving weird sex. I'm interested.
---
enter a team bud, they will help u with long term goals
---
What crazy about this is the insane fact that HS is more dangerous than null. That being said, they shouldn’t get gank nor should npc kill them. Unless we are going to move all of null rewards to HS.
---
I wonder if people would respond as positively if a pvper said they hate all the crying pvpers 🤔
---
You feel sorry for them
---
It's a whole lot fucking different than with cynosural fields.
---
&gt;everyone talks about all these different jobs
---
Don't think about it as jobs. They are activities you do ingame for fun (hopefully).
---
&gt;but how do you get to the chance to do them?
---
From context I get you want to know how to do before mentioned "jobs". Apparently you have something in mind there. What is the "job" you don't know how to do? I'm sure people can point you into the right direction.
---
PS: The people pushing you to join certain corporation are simply cringy please ignore them.
---
Thanks - just checking. I'll reboot/restart (just get all the sigs in Tripwire first).
---
I really liked the Dawn of Justice event, and the Blood Raider one wasn't the worst. It was just incredibly frustrating to participate in the later events only to find out that the rewards were essentially worthless.   
---
Drugs and accelerators were awesome, especially when they didn't require mining. More of those please. Less blueprints for stuff that you can't make a profit manufacturing, like the augmented and integrated drones. Or make the event sites drop industry inputs for those items as well.
---
Ah, don't worry, I saw a smaller corp which I wanna join, I'd much rather not be a cog in the machine. And for my fun activity, I'd probably like to be some kind of stealth PvP ship, I've already gotten a Tristan with a few drones up and running
---
Time to put on your junior designer hat, then.  Design a probe and wormhole system that allows the following:
---
1. Anyone in the system can find all signatures, given similar skills+effort.
---
2. The defender is not aware of the attacker before the attacker could spot the attacker.
---
3. The defender cannot remove all entries to their system, if they don't wish to leave it.
---
Part 1 is reasonably straightforward, but I think you'll find parts 2 and 3 are in tension.
---
Okay n00b.
---
I've been playing Eve since May 2003. I was on the team that helped deploy the ISS Marginis, the first player-owned outpost ever put up in Eve. Maybe you've heard of it. 
---
I have firsthand experience with how hard it is to make things happen in Null Sec. I can absolutely promise you that every single Null Sov holder will agree with me that it is almost a full-time job to keep their space, organize it logistically, and provide that safety. IT'S NOT GIVEN TO THEM. THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO WORK FOR IT.
---
This is one of the fundamental flaws in High-Sec thinking. They assume that since they have the protection of Concord that Null is like that with all the Sov. It's not. Not by a long shot. All you've shown people here is that you know very little about how the game actually works because you haven't fully explored and experienced those aspects.
---
Now, it should be known by now that I am one of those High-Sec Carebears. That doesn't, however, make me a lemming. When I get noobs in my corporation, I train them to look for personalities just like yours and avoid them like the plague, because they will hate their time in this game and eventually quit.
---
Also, if you can't handle a few Trigs, you really should consider playing something else.
---
Was that bad? Was I not supposed to do that? Do I get a spanking? (Pls say yes to spanking.)
---
Not my can of Spod, but you do you. =)
---
I've honestly never seen CODE. whine. I've seen them talk massive amounts of shit and pull off some of the best fucking RP in Eve, but I've never heard them whine.
---
Youre a bitch. No way you been playing that long. You make ignorant pussy comments that show how weak you are. Git gud
---
Oh makes sense, thanks
---
i support this, every crybaby just wants a buff to their play style and a painful nerf to anything that can invade there “safe” space
---
For me, it's relaxing and allows me to teach my new corp members how to work with basic fleet structure. Many of them end up going out to Null or J-space and becoming good PvPers because they aren't complete jackasses at understanding fleet commands.
---
I encourage them to find a new corporation if they want to change playstyles. I help them find a good one if they want me to help. That's the kind of thing that should happen in this game. I kinda want it to be around for a lot longer.
---
&gt; for one day
---
Sure, call it an r/Eve blackout...
---
Concord used to not instantly kill ships
---
Ouch. Aeman is pretty hot, these days.
---
how dare you
---
Any tips or tricks for someone that is just starting out and has almost nothing?
---
PushX
---
So, you're that attention whore? Okay, I'll play.
---
Look, I could roll out references of players all fucking day you could check with, but to be honest, you're a fucking worm who likes attention.
---
You want to call it bullshit, go on ahead and do it, kid. No skin off my fuckin' nose. It doesn't change reality in the slightest.
---
But now... now is my favorite part of the show where your narcissistic tendencies take over and you simply won't be able to let this conversation go. You will continue to comment with barely literate responses trying to establish some sort of dominance over me. Which will make me laugh and laugh as I drink in the buckets of your tears.   
---
Alright, now it's your turn. Go on. That's an order.
---
All praise the Bubbles and extra thanks goes out for the Logistics wing o7
---
For RMTing*
---
You wouldnt get that much IQ even if you added together all the IQ of every member in CODE.
---
Dare I say, a better job. I would much rather have voluntary player cooperation towards a larger goal rather then top-down authority from CCP. You can still go for plex farming but their will always be rogues that want to do their own thing, and they will have to dunk it out with the PVP loyalists. This is real eve. This is how an ideal eve functions.
---
Ahh.  That clears it up.  Thanks.
---
LOL I wanna see that
---
This pleases me
---
I typically  kind of AFK because I like to mine while I study.
---
I stepped away from the computer for a minute to get something to drink and came back to my wreck and a Triglavian zipping around.
---
After the initial "dammit!"...I was pleasantly surprised.
---
for fucks sake please limit this to a grand total of 4 systems in all of new eden, one for each faction
---
Ever seen a post so shit that it's actually pretty fucking good? Right here ladies and gents.
---
Yeah, a few actually. 
---
* First, look for a good corp to hook up with. Take your time and don't just rush into one. The easiest thing to do is post up on the Eve-O forums that you're looking and what you're looking for. This will help recruiters determine if they're right for you or not. Ask them lots of questions before you select one. (A good mining corp will make sure you're taken care of and help you learn the game, not just mining.)
---
* Never fly anything you're not willing to lose. As soon as you undock, you consent to PvP. Period. Remain situationally aware and don't AFK unless you dock up in most circumstances.
---
* Trust but verify. Trust is a rare thing in Eve, but it is necessary to work with others. Trust wisely and with a logical head instead of hopes and aspirations.
---
* Do the tutorials. All of them. They really can help you decide what you want to do most in this game.
---
* Go somewhere in a PvP ship and get killed. Then do it again, and again, and again. You will die in EVE. Get used to it.
---
* Have fun! If what you're doing isn't fun, why the fuck are you doing it? 
---
Those are just a few basic ones. I'm not trying to recruit on here because that's not what the thread is about. If you wanna chat in-game, though, you can PM your character name and I'll look you up. I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have that I know about.
---
Empty high slots do that already and an auto targeter I uses 1pg 1cpu
---
Im not the type of guy to cry about PVP (though ive never been ganked before in high sec) but tbh PVP isnt the reason I log in every day. I love PVE. Not because its extremely fun content but rather because its predictable. Whats fun about the game for my is optimizing fits and just generaly doing science with fits to see what works and what doesnt. I couldnt give a flying shit about PVP
---
Battleships are slow as fuck so rarely even brought into enemy space in the first place. They're also wiped out by bombers, so i dunno why people cry about caps shitting on them when bombers do the same thing
---
&gt; Makes you wonder how people even started playing without them.
---
People who started 15 years ago didn't have to contend with a bunch of people that had a 15 year head start on skill training.
---
I came back a few weeks ago, and I have sorely missed it.
---
I also sorely miss the Captain's Quarters. I actually liked it.
---
edit: V/R. That takes me back.
---
&gt; But if you are new to the game then you need injectors or a good way to train things.
---
For a lot of bittervets, that's precisely why they're seen as cancer.
---
I will say the Trigs got me in my mission Tengu. I'd just come back after a pretty long break from the game and I had literally no idea what they were or what they did. First day back and a lot had changed.  I basically felt like, "Ah, there's the Eve I know and love. Always fucking trying to murder me." LOL!
---
Maybe they should nerf your posting instead
---
Kill date: September 29th
---
Find a small group. The nullbloc marketing is strong but you end up just being another faceless nobody most of the time. But in a small group you can find a place to belong, a niche to excel at, a speciality that makes you worth knowing. More than 50 people, smaller than 200. Thats the sweet spot
---
I tried to join TEST, they wouldnt let me in :(
---
Yes that's my point, thank you.  Imperial/"American" units are asinine.  Metric is better.
---
&gt;Battleships are a lot of fun: they hit hard, they have a bunch of utility slots, ...and they get absolutely annihilated by bosons, carriers, HAW dreads, and supers.
---
You forgot bombers. 
---
It seems popular to cry about big ships shitting on smaller ones, but then bombers will absolutely fuck up battleships too. Also a Leshak can solo a carrier, granted the pilot needs some skill, but it can be done. Battleships aren't completely weak.
---
not karma whoring
---
Hey, I still have one of those!
---
You have it backwards, injectors create problems because the game isn't balanced.  If the game was balanced there wouldn't be a problem with people instantly flying something they cannot currently fly, because whatever they are now flying would be balanced.
---
If anything, people instantly jumping into whatever the most imbalanced ship currently is gives CCP immediate info on what the most imbalanced ship currently is.  That would be immensely useful if balance was a real concern for CCP and the playerbase.
---
I have also been gone for a while, but from talking to people in Amarr, CCP Fozzie seems to be pretty disliked by the veterans. I'm told he's largely responsible for many changes that the vets are unhappy with.
---
everything must end someday... it was fun as long as it lasted... sadly we dont really have an alternative... and no, SC is never gonna be one...
---
i am sad
---
And _after_ the spanking...
---
. #castleAnthrax.
---
Here ya go, I guess you'll need this.
---
/s
---
Sick burn. I guess.
---
You haven't mentioned the biggest buff hisec mining got: Orca EHP has been buffed to essentially be now ungankable. That's why a lot of hisec players are mad about losing their ship to trigs. The ship they thought invincible has been killed so they bitch and whine.
---
that one actually made me laugh xD
---
edit: you deserve that upvote
---
Look kid, i call it how i see it. This game is too hard for you yet you play so you can feel like youre apart of something great. You’re not, comments like blah blah hs players cry blah blah when null space is the safest space in the game. When black out was here, players like you bitches and moaned. Git gud, stop fucking sucking and learn the game. Sit down and think. This game is a complex puzzle. Lastly, FFS! Don’t make fun of the player who using 3d puzzles while your dumbass is trying to fit the circle in the fucking triangle! Don’t talk because you have nothing to talk about. Spend time learning eve you fucking moron!
---
Also, why need a longer range web? If it's in Web range, its also in scram range. Unless ur using a point, but in that case, why are you kiting in web range without a scram?
---
Acl hangers are prolly next. Anything attached right now to Corp roles will eventually be switched over.
---
Likely they started with bookmarks as a test. Loosing bookmarks, while bad, isn't a big deal compared to fubaring Corp hangers.
---
Responded to the wrong post?
---
Well the post was wrong indeed, but my post was a correct correction to that wrong post.
---
See? Easily predictable when narcissistic traits are displayed. A lack of being able to formulate complete sentences, complete deflection of lack of own knowledge, constant insults to try to enrage the other participant in the conversation. 
---
And, again, you will have to respond to this message. In fact, I don't believe you will be capable of not responding. You will follow the order because you simply can't resist it.
---
Your turn again. Go.
---
just moved a few system around jita and found some.
---
I feel the same. I had a good 12 year run and enjoyed most of it. Blackout gave me the most fun I had in about 4 years (except tournament), but reasons\~ within CCP said no to this. Most of my subs run out in mid December except my main who is still subbed til December 2020. At this point I don't see me playing next year. TBF the main reason I did not quit already are my friends in my corp.
---
Too much Sodium...
---
I don’t know if you realize this or not, you a below grade eve player. I read your first comment then half of what you replied to me. This is because you’re not worth the time for me to read you horrible logic on why i should respect you or your gameplay. You’re part of the cancer that killing my hardcore MMO.
---
How long has it been since you've been in null? Null of even 3 years ago is pretty different, nevermind null before that. You're right that null needs a ton of logistics to work, but this never impacts you if you're a line member that's Rorq mining or capital ratting 
---
Even before enemies arrive, you have an intel channel telling you that they've been spotted a few jumps away, meaning all you need is to dock up to be safe. If they happen to come through a wormhole and you're their first target, only then will you risk being attacked. Once enemies attack you, all you need is to hit the PANIC and cyno button and have 5 mins of invulnerability, where a FAX and supers can log in and save you, which happens more often than not.
---
Add to that that you need a sizeable fleet to kill a single Rorq. It's really not as easy as getting 2-3 catalysts to kill a barge. You need to silently maneuver a fleet of 20-30 cloaky ships (or multiple caps) without getting spotted. That's a hard enough task as it is, requiringa  lot of investment, nevermind how tanky and hard to kill a Rorq is once you actually get on grid.
---
Once you get into mining/pve capitals, null is much safer than hisec. It's a different story for subcaps and mining barges, since they usually don't last long enough to be saved, but capitals are currently so tanky that killing one is very hard, much harder than killing barges in hisec.
---
This is exactly the salt which fuels my space ships. Thank you!
---
So vets think "suffer the same way I did"?
---
Back in early '03, there was a group of player pirates that went by the name M0o. They were notorious for discovering glitches in the game they could exploit. And originally, Concord was not the invincible buff beasts they are now. That actually happened because of M0o.
---
Thank you space friend.
---
Do you have a mental retardation?
---
Also, how old are you?
---
So you are indeed arguing for not changing this. There is always this game with people pretending to want to fix something, but in the end, the result is nothing. It's almost a concern troll.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/dd7qss/mer_monthly_economic_report_september_2019/f2estek/
---
&gt;Yeah k162 wormholes would not be visible on probe scanner for 4 hours unless someone warped to it from the other side.
---
This needs to be redesigned.
---
Less than commoner still replying. STFU scrub! Go find a game that actually at your level. Classic wow is waiting
---
Asshole
---
I know that you're proving me right.
---
Every...

...time.
---
So, now it's your turn again. Do you have the will power to resist? No, no you do not.
---
My brother, I watched him when he played and I really started to like this game. He’s been playing it for years. I’ve played Eve for few hours after the tutorial and got my ship destroyed so now I travel in a sperm cell. I’m probably going to create a new account.
---
As opposed to abusing cloak warp trick shit server code to safely haul items 100% of the time??
---
I dont play world of wetards thank you.
---
Does your mom know you're making these posts on weddit?
---
It's funny because a miner that's been playing for 14 YEARS started a fourm post about how "incursion rats" keep killing him. Turns out, it's actually invasion scouts! And this guy is in a fucking orca. Orcas should be able to kill invasion scouts, he doesn't know what dscan is either. His post blew up with people agreeing with him. This is along the lines of what somebody said, "I liked mining before because I could go and do something else while my ship mines and now I can't"
---
Still talking? Where do you live so i can wipe you from the game.
---
If you have been training skills don't bother starting with a new account. You can always do lvl 1 missions to get some isk for a better ship. Or try out low lvl exploration sites in high sec
---
1DQ1-A
---
Come at me bro
---
Oh yeah, I definitely agree with you there. It's just that the margin of error is so high that the risk of having an orca die (especially before Trig rats) is basically zero. CODE won't bother you because they need a minimum of 50 catalysts to gank you in a 0.5 system, which you'd spot and dock up if you pay even half attention, and that's if they can even gather 50 people to form up for a single Orca, when they could instead form up for lucrative haulers.
---
While capital/super escalation is certainly an ability to project power but even in the subcap department you guys are often lacking. Even when you guys aren't running from a blackout, it is still sad to see your fleets are primarily composed of only 3 or 4 alliances. You guys could project so much power if you guys could get the corps/alliances in your space to actually give a damn about something other than industry or krabbing.
---
As for the cockroaches thing - Twilight has it right. You guys are like Keith Richards - any other mortal would have already died from what he's done to himself.
---
Provi could be great but it requires leadership. But you are already where you are and you aren't interested in the whole "this power projection thing could actually be fun" so, have fun doing whatever it is you are doing, I guess?
---
I stoped playing because my ship got destroyed at the beginning and my pc was really bad so the game was barely playable. Now I have a better one but don’t have time because of school. Can’t wait to start again! Oh and does the o7 mean salute? Idk what this is
---
Im already there, all yall do is cry about me killing your shit. So sit down like the bitch you are!
---
Oh, well welcome to Delve. I hope you enjoy your holiday.
---
Mostly just more people doing them I think.
---
I'm well aware that Null mechanics have changed over the years. I make it a point to keep up with the patch notes and changes that happen. 
---
And yes, you are correct. NOW Null Sec is pretty safe compared to back in the day. I'm not arguing that point. However, A LOT of work by A LOT of people that came before you made that happen. It didn't just all of the sudden happen automagically like everyone seems to assume. I can't even fathom the logic that thinks this way.  
---
And the only thing that makes the assertion that High Sec is more dangerous is specifically due to the assumption that you are safe because it's High Sec. It's not because it's actually more dangerous. It's because people fit their ships like numpty retards, AFK all the time, and refuse to learn how to adapt due to their feelings of entitlement instead of acknowledging their failures and learning from their mistakes.
---
they gone
---
No.  I don't hate them at all actually. But it isn't all roses like they are wanting to project either. There are some serious leadership deficiencies in Provi and if they had some real leadership, they could be something great.
---
This is seriously what I would like to see. I want to see an awesome and strong Provi.
---
The sad thing is though, history tends to repeat itself.
---
Sounds like you would love Path of Exile.
---
Not universally, but there's definitely an element of "we walked uphill both ways to school, barefoot, in the snow" at play here.  Why else would people get salty about these free SP events, which give out amounts of SP that are comparatively trivial for characters that have been training for more than a year or two?
---
Nope, there's none left
---
Been doing the same and having a blast. After local came back I was a little disheartened to roam solo in my retri fit. 
---
People actually undock for the T1 hurricane (because it looks like lunch) and it’s a surprisingly resilient ship when flown semi intelligently. Having a ton of fun and I’ve gotten a few kills, each more rewarding than the last.
---
If you mean from one major release to another (e.g. 16.04 Xenal -&gt; 18.04 Bionic) it does (assuming your distro uses such a concept, not all do), although whether there's friendly tools for it depends on which distro you pick. On ubuntu you'll get prompted to do it through the upgrade window, or you can also trigger it any time with 
---
    sudo do-release-upgrade
---
That is the fundamental flaw in logic that a lot of High Sec miners. "I should be able to go do what I want and be safe in-game because, waaaaaaaah!"
---
I absolutely HATE that mentality. I'm seriously considering turning on friendly fire in my corp and letting them know if I catch them AFK in a field, I will kill them myself.
---
Please provide proof it was only vily, because the post that accused him of that was an out right lie.
---
Edit: Added the actual CSM notes:
---
&gt;The ninja looting in these sites was brought up and there are arguments for and against changing this. it's considered a fundamental part of many aspects of the game such as Sotyio blueprint drops and so on. CCP Coyote mentions that this might balance itself out in lowsec when people can actually fight back.
---
Ship being balanced != ship being obsolete.
---
And you know, if CODE. gets 50 together and I'm AFK, good. I'm going to applaud them for a job well done. Then I'll go buy another Orca and be smarter next time.
---
They should have made excavators use fighter mechanics
---
You have to prove it with a screenshot and a piece of paper with the date on it.
---
holy shit, 2 posts on reddit about eve that i agree with, fuck me running,
---
is this bait :)
---
What's it like to be this alpha? I got pregnant just reading this post.
---
They're back
---
hu hu hu.
---
It's stupidly funny,I like this.
---
ACL standing. I give standing and group to people, and ohter people can know who's who !!!!!!
---
both : yes please!
---
I agree. I mine with my alts. And I watch them hoping for content. I don't afk.
---
What players? Are there any left?
---
I think he was joking on himself showing he is not able to make a correct post as a proof of stupidity :)
---
I mean, it's mandatory to shit on someone on r/eve . Does not mean you actualy dislike them. Bonus point awarded if the shitting is obviously absurd, because it means you are shitting yourself \\o/
---
I do agree that it isn't frequent, but it's kind of like that guy that wrote the book and he's like "war is 80% logistics and 20% fighting". It's kind of like that, but part of that 80% is theorycrafting your ships and comp, doing research on movements and occupations happening in the game, the logistics of setting yourself up for pvp, etc.
---
I'm not even sure what you're trying to say. I'm just going to upvote you out of charity.
---
It's probably a conspiracy. We've been watching you. You should really wash your hands after masturbating. That's why your food tastes so salty. :D
---
I don't get why Arby's didn't bring back the 5 for 5 deal. That shit was dope.
---
Seen this so many times. Accurate.
---
It is if you have your medical clone and a lot of spare ships staged in the area.
---
t’was a joke but thank you. The miner/ganker conversation is so old I can do both sides’ argument in my sleep (but don’t that’ll be weird)
---
I don’t have a dog in this fight, neither miner nor ganker but it’s just odd to see a conversation line repeat itself for years and years and years
---
Well, ill be over at /r/whoosh then, sry m8. Lol
---
Like 300m/hr, at least 90m/hr if you are half awake, about 5-15m into a basic exploration ship, around 50m for a cov-ops, about 120m for a decked out Astero.
---
You can make isk easy, use wormholes to pop out into a random null/LS pocket, if you want local and be almost zero risk, or do all the C3 relic sites to and play with all the t3c and Strats trying to get you.
---
About 3.50
---
Running null explo, you can get lucky and hit a relic site with 80-100mill loot. But that's not the rule. Usually, I used to make 100 Mill per hour in areas with low activity and good drops. Friendly advice: Keep away from the dronelands, explo loot there is terrible.
---
Better than 90% of r/Eve content.
---
While I generally agree with you, CODE is pretty bad for the game overall because of how they scare off new players form eve.
---
They actually don't. Research suggests the exact opposite, as someone enlightened me to earlier in the thread. It's somewhere down there, but this assumption is actually an urban myth in Eve. Getting ganked doesn't cause new players to leave the game. In fact, statistically, very few noobs get ganked.
---
They also only surveyed the players who stayed, and they had the tank in common, but EVE doesn't have an exit survey.
---
they do but people who are not interested in eve would not even answer an exit survey.
---
&gt;you should put all the effort to protect yourself AND provide minerals and ships for us to pvp with
---
80k people in a game that probably has probably 200k people a month.  Plus this probably won't include people that aren't invested or are angry with the game to not want anything to do with it.
---
Sure, use your bias blindness.

 (◕‿◕) Just me, you and all our alts, friend (◕‿◕)

It is just you then, friend.
---
Is PvE being predictable and you "winning" over system all the reason you play this game for? In that case I don't understand why you don't go to another game that does it much better?
---
Striped down mobile version of Eve, well done for what it is, if they capture the same social stuff of the main game in a easy to approach guided way it might have a chance.
---
That said, I have zero interest if it’s not tied in with the main universe, I am not starting over, and I can’t dual-box on a phone-tablet.
---
Can't live like that. Gotta forgive and forget.
---
&gt; the traditional skill tree
---
What do you mean by this? In most RPGs I've played (not many, admittedly) the player can unlock everything as far as I could tell.
---
That's not an achievment to be proud of tbh
---
Hes right though, dude normally only fights if he has 80% to 20% Logi to DPS or if its to welp a fleet to help RF a fort :P
---
What's an NPC Forwarding Base and are they profitable to kill?
---
Better run those who do explo sites.
---
Played the alpha a bit. Much better than I thought it would be. The problem is it's a game on mobile, not a mobile game. It has to stay open to continue auto pilot, which is a major time sink
---
Use search, there was a thread on it last test.
---
Must be looking for new dread parts to be delivered

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CdMKJpA0pg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CdMKJpA0pg)

something good to read finally...

Well delivered

99.9% have

let's not encourage players to leave, especially when much constructive criticism is given daily.
---
Doesn’t it overheat better/longer?
---
This describes perfectly the biggest issue the game has. Otherwise the UX was rather well thought. It also felt like you could start eve from scratch and that felt very nic3 :)
---
&gt; Funny how you claim I like injectors and am claiming that makes them not broken, yet your best defense of bad balance persisting far longer than it needs to is that you liked it that way. Don't be a hypocrite. 
---
Lol, hey guys, i keep 20k skillpoints just chillin in case i need to fast train into something broken, but theres literally nothing wrong with that and you're a hypocrite if you think there is.
---
&gt;  Take a break from /r/Eve.
---
Haha, fuck you cheese dick, what on earth would make you think anybody would listen to you about anything at all?
---
&gt; "..I have zero interest if it’s not tied in with the main universe, I am not starting over..."
---
I completely agree. If CCP can somehow enable a way for us to transfer our main Capsuleers data from PC onto the mobile app would be more than sufficient!
---
I highly doubt CCP would make EVE Echoes pay 2 win, but I do believe there will be micro-transactions for   
---
 the little simple things like skins or plex, which is already in the main EVE Online game.
---
Because some web fit rely on staying out of scram range. It's called web/kiting. You use a warp disruptor with web and use this to outrange brawler and scram/kiter without being a mwd kiter.
---
This is used in low sec for some hulls with bonuses to range : the rifter for instance with arty loaded with short range ammo but since it has a bonus to range you still kite at 10-13 km. Some hulls also allow you to fire rocket at web range.
---
Basically you max out damage by using a "normally" short range weapon but which given to the right hull allow you to outrange scram kiter and brawlers using web for range control. All the power if you fit double web.

No, those boosters were absolutely retarded and broke LP markets.
---
My sentiments exactly. Thanks for voicing your positivity and speaking for (likely, but no empirical way to confirm it) me and many others.
---
I have heard, and from my experience, that fighters won’t decloak people
---
I've spent my entire eve career in wormholes. I can tell you that it's a hard fact that you will *never* get blobbed as hard in a wh fight as you will, every time, out in null bloc space. If nothing else, wh mass limits that cancer to the extent necessary.
---
I think living in wh space is pretty relaxing. I also find scanning very cathartic so ymmv.
---
I don't know why people assume theres one right way to play the game? Who cares if they dont want to be ganked? Not everyone is going to enjoy the same aspects of the game and degrading them for wanting to be safe is not the right way of addressing it. Some people just want to mine and be left alone, honestly what's wrong with that? Leave those poor miners alone! If they wanted action they would move to null or low.
---
Edit: Spelling
---
&gt; It also felt like you could start eve from scratch and that felt very nic3 :) 
---
Are you implying that we can play EVE Echoes with our original Capsuleers from EVE Online?
---
the ones complainig about ganking (wardecks also previously) that move to null, get to complain about afk cloaking and roaming wormholers
---
I’m not “encouraging anyone to leave” the game but instead suggesting people who are pissed about game changes should probably reevaluate their outlook and recognize when the game has moved on from them.  
---
Being asshurt over changes doesn’t entitle anyone the right to be toxic asshats just because other people may still find enjoyment.
---
Your argument literally doesn't debunk or disprove the original statement in any way other than saying correlation does not equal causation.
---
which is already enough.
---
What the guy claimed CCP did say and what CCP did say are two different things, therefore the post I answer to is wrong.
---
"correlation does not imply causation" is the argument used by CCP to explain why this post is wrong, indeed.
---
&gt;  ...you are literally the antivaxer of eve. 
---
Gold.
---
How long have you been playing?
---
Wow. If you think the log-in numbers are low in game then you'll be shocked how low these numbers will be. The bots are good at farming. Not so good at posting.

---
The important part i think is always to convo your victim if you realize it's a newbro or someone inexperienced ( poor fit for instance).
---
It's one thing to blow up with an explanation on what can you do to improve and entirely another to blow up without it.
---
But then NPE should better explain how taking risk works in Eve. Like the 1000 isk/EHP for hauling, how to use d-scan in low sec etc etc.

You realize the OP is a carebear, yeah? Not all generalizations are correct.
---
Primarily because they "already trained that skill" so now you should have to suffer too.
---
Indeed; guide the new players.  But if you try to guide them and they just fling shit in your face, odds are pretty good they'll be uninstalling within 36 hours because "fucking toxic griefers rub it in your face" or some shit.
---
It's literally statistical data that can be looked at and evaluated. I'm willing to bet your failed your statistics courses at uni.
---
Insinuating that those things were not a problem before injectors. Different path, yes, but the issues stay the same.
---
Are you volunteering to accept my seed inside of you? I mean, if that's your thing, I can offer reasonable pricing.

So much this.

I'm surprised BBC (adversity) didn't counter drop ice with some tits
---
CODE. doesn't gank real miners. Real miners fit tank. It's good for the body and it's good for the soul.
---
This whole thread embodies what is wrong with /r/eve.
---
I can understand what you mean, and I feel the same, but lately the dev's team just point the middle finger to the community. I join eve right before they introduce citadels, it was a fucking bad release but I was so hyped, everyone was against it and I was not understand why.. few month later they released rorq/super update, I did not had access to both but it was a big change for the average player, as a miner I was looking forward for it, as a ratter I was aiming for a carrier even more now.. 
---
And that's it, that's the change the dev's brought to the game that hyped him, that get me thrill, the abyssal ? Nice I like eve for it's "online" not to being close down in a safe pocket, the invasion thing ? We had sansha, it never interested me enough to get into it so making it into trig meeeeh ? Even if you like the abyssal thing it happen already a year (at least) ago, and right now the dev's are not really telling us "look we are making this or that and that will change this or that" nah, the only thing we are hearing from them so far is "boohoo era of chaos, we throw random change and wait our community unsub to make it stop" (I don't want to talk about the no local stuff, it alone require an essay to talk about it).
---
Yes I love eve, Yes I want to play, Yes it's maybe my favorite video game (wow is a nice competitor) but man, when I talk to my friends about eve, I feel bad to say "I keep a few account sub to keep them training skill, hoping one day it will mater again"
---
I wonder what the story is in this new universe.
---
Because they lost the war and the alliance's collective anal circumference has been forcibly increased by Barney the Dinosaur and his friends.
---
Its totally RNG. But the average is 30 mil per site and you can usually find 2 sites an hour. Sometimes you get lucky and get 100m out of one can that boost your isk per hour.
---
But then you may not find anything for 2 hours which brings it back down.
---
Everyone is supposed to be buttmad at CCP and believe the game is actually dying this time. Posts like OP's flies in the face of that rhetoric. People would sooner cram the sub with posts designed to chase new players away- to reinforce their opinion the game is dead
---
"accept your seed". This is how you sound in your head isn't it?
---

Not everyone has that luxury. I've been trying to join a corp for a week but since my hours are not in prime tz availability, I haven't been  able to do an interview yet. It sucks but this has been the best response I've gotten so far. More than 20 mil sp and still looking for a corp. 
---
Like I said though. It's just because my hours are all f'd up. Can't be helped.
---
Oh boy and land 15 off every gate, kestrels with torpedo launchers, 8 heat sink geddons.
---
No, not at all. 
---
If getting ganked doesn't teach you something and you learn from it, then you absolutely deserve to get ganked over and over and over. This is called Darwinism and it's one of Eve's best features.
---
And again, NOWHERE IN EVE WAS EVER SUPPOSED TO BE SAFE. This is known thing since the very first day the game went live. This fixation with safety is for single-player games with cheat codes and non-PVP servers at WoW. That isn't Eve. Never has been and never will be, no matter how much people cry and moan.
---
Im guessing your looking into null or wh im still in high sec and happy with my corp my killboard is in the shitter they dont care i dont care as long as i have fun what does it matter if my killboard is like a bil negative
---
🤔
---
i can adapt that comment to try and invalidate every single patch, no gameplay change is without side effects, that doesn't mean a side is being ignored.
---
👀💦
---
But that game doesn't exist anymore to post about :(
---
What is this comment lol.
---
Just because they didn't have the might to beat legacy doesn't mean that they don't have the might to beat up some renters.
---
Depends on what you enjoy in the game, best advice get away from r/eve.
---
Lol I’ve heard the eve community overall is pretty brutal in general
---
10+ Rorqs in Delve.
---
There are good groups here and there, once you find a home (and if you arent retarded) it's really easy to make friends. Eve university is a good place to start learning the game. r/eve is a bunch of bitter vets who hate the game they love.
---
Yeah, I joined an alliance, they helped me start out pretty good, I was thinking mining, seems chill but idk if it’s over played or not
---
Is this bait 🤔
---
Or are you retarded 🤔
---
Mining is pretty good, it's really heavily weighted towards the top end of the income chain but you can do it ok in a barge if you have nice friends.
---
Find those guys and shoot at them.  This is your calling.
---
Dont forget the part where we shit on miners for years and years until we realized it was a mistKe and changed our ways.
