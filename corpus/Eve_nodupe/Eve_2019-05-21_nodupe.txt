Found the post and its about 33.3-35 k
---
Would it matter if it was?
---
When you get in a serious fight, it's a good idea to make sure the other guy doesn't get up.
---

---
Who cares if they defend.  Bashing structures isn't that bad.  You let them build a little of their sandcastle, enough to hurt morale when it dies, but not enough to be unmanageable, and then you kick it over again.
---
That's how you decimate an opponent in EVE.  You sit on their face until they bleed enough members for you to be comfortable.
---
have you been living under a rock the last 3 days?
---
I completely agree, totally the main reason I reupped an account
---
Nituspar is the sharpest I've ever flown under.
---
Really? Unless it was the Fed Navy Comet, I don't think I ever got it.
---
lol, bullshit.  First, it was pretty easy to see.  Goons bled significantly, but their retreat was obviously successful.  Everyone knew they'd rebuild pretty quickly.  Maybe it was arrogance from NCPL that led them to believe goons wouldn't be a major problem.
---
Second, you don't camp npc null for six months.  You let them build up a little, then you go kick it over.
---
Third, they had no issues sitting in Podion and O-SHT for months.
---
I understand the kind of content PL wants is punching down only.  It's why PL is dying when there's no good easy target anymore.

Drugs, how could you forget?

if Goons win the north. will they rent out some of the space to chinese renters?

Does the training rate consume skill points?

---
He did.  But he loved to look at our titans and supers.   When the ship he was looking at docked, his camera defaulted back to show his ship.  On live stream, he didn't realize that we could see the keep star with distance.
---
Training rate is how much raw SP you gaining per minute by training that skill.
---
Just curious if anyone got a response from CCP? I got my SP but people are asking in game about it.
---
More goons eating shit to TEST renters? Surprise surprise. :D

REEEEEEEE I'M BAD

HTFU.  That’s what I’d do.
---
Thank you, that's the only thing I needed to know.
---

---
That would still making making more iskies than most.....
---
I started reading this. The thing is, I would do this solo if I could but I don't think I can reach out to these various warring corps unless I set up a corporation beforehand. The war tab doesn't even let me access the "help the defending corp" feature.
---
LUL xanos....you and your screenshots. Hot stuff
---
You in Catch bro?
---
As a guy whose been through that battle before, good luck man and make sure to take care of yourself. Reach out if ever you need to. No one (including myself) should go through it alone &lt;3
---
Subtle flex but okay
---
Install chrome remote desktop or something and remote in on your phone. It takes literally 3 minutes to set up. If it's that important to you it's minimal effort
---
Sisi?
---
retarded goon post looking for uptoots.... lame.
---
Not if when. And of course even if it's by proxy of TEST
---
You CANNOT miss the videos put out by Rooks and Kings. Their leader was one of the best.
---
Let me help you out. When Goons were eating shit circa 2016 in World War Bee, all Mittens could do is claim they were carrying out the "Fabian strategy" over and over again.
---
Mercs rarely chase the war targets actively, I never hired them in war times, as they were usually too expensive for what they provided. They rather mass wardec and camp a gate along a high traffic route and pick off careless reds.
---
And at some point you need to invest heavy efforts in operations, granted you really want to strike them where it hurts. These can be so extensive, that nobody would really pay your price. I'm not speaking of starting a 100 vs 100 battle, I'm speaking of infiltration of organisations and the theft of billions of corp assets. The only ships that aren't replaced are friendships!
---
Also as soon as your target sees they're no match for you, they usually will just dock up for the rest of the day. They're fallacious enough to call you a risk averse carebear for not feeding your ship to their 15+ bling Proteus gang, but on the other hand, they wouldn't feed their ships to your 15+ bling Proteus gang.
---
Hey man your bound to eat a little shit when you eating all DAT AZZZZZZ YEET
---
I didnt realise there was a standardized fit for the atron.
---
That's it! That's the goal! Goon camper wins!

Now, let's go to the big board, Jim, and show them what they have won?

Yeah, what is a few Kwhs for your PC to be on for 8\~12h you are out of the house right? Plus need to be the only user of the machine to be sure, have no one in the house trying to shut it  down, hope that there isn't any blackout  or have a UPS/notebook...

Not talking about firewall/ISPs problems that may have to be dealt with to be able to remote your machine.

Crazy idea - maybe whoever you main is with should not shit on people wanting to do pve. Then you wouldn't have to rent like a peasant.
---
I try to imagine your locking times. See you in a bit.
---
Imagine being so dumb that you think "Krabbing in delve WILL kill you" means "PB is fine tho"
---
good on you my friend, doing Bob's work
---
Until the 20th means it's over at the start of that day.  Through the 20th would have included that day.  This is English

TMI briefly had a break from it all (the game itself) We will be back and kicking very soon! This is the first of many :)

"I was late and will blame others"
---
So you didnt log in for 16 straight days? I dont see why thats ccps fault.
---
Oh wiat, nevermind. I always forget Stabber has those Launcher points...
---
Don't start a corp yet. Join another corp to learn how to pvp, how to run corps and answer questions you don't know need answering. Preparation is the key, and you need to prepare yourself first.

We fought NC toe to toe and held our own. You want to talk about relevant? NC couldnt do shit until they called in panfam.
---
They gave you 19 days i think. That was plenty of time.
---
Hey Ember o7
---
Learn to do math. I got mine with two days to spare
---
if you are canceling omega because you were late to the party after 2 full weeks of warnings and announcements on the FREE giveaway then its probably best you quit now, clearly eve isn't the game for you.
---
because the event was 19 days long...

Butthurt because you can't read a callender

The systematic anti-gunner play of [not filing of charges](https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2019/04/daniel-zimmerman/pittsburgh-da-to-citizens-looking-to-file-charges-against-city-officials-over-gun-laws-not-so-fast/) as to enforce a law on honorable law abiding citizens without giving them standing to fight in court to overturn the law it is the very definition of tyranny.
---
sort was in an avatar in b-r
---
The mistake you made is that the first day you also counted, while downtime had already passed. So in reality you did it for 15.5 days or similar.

That's sort of the point of the design tho. Heavy armored side is to be pointed at the enemy, to protect the fighter launch area from enemy fire. - Amarr are fanatically armor focused, so they wouldn't depend on shields for that like the other races.
---
A lot of people don't seem to realize this.

Nice narrative you have there to bad it's entirely back asswards.

"I went to the countryside with my girlfriend" so it turns out this was just a bait post all along. Well played, well played.

Elo Knight from Black Legion is probably the one you'll hear referenced the most. When I flew with him years ago I would have said he was the best, but since then I've flown with commanders that are as good as he is, though rarely as fun. Great situational awareness, deep game knowledge &amp; high expectations. A lot of the really "great" FCs still play and are quite active.
---
If you can field somewhat the same, go full dps and some neut and paints; if you for less, you might wanna try a "cancer fit", full ECM asshole mode.
---
Oooooh. Those I did get. I thought everyone got those.
---
No, you can clearly see he has orbital camera selected.
---
these guys... are mining.... outside of delve cause they're all dying.... whatthefuckisthisshit
---
I don't think I've ever experienced Roy reeeing proper

Well, I suppose we could always do with another Querious. :)
---
I was able to still light one 2j away in the same const tho.
---
First FC I flew with that made me realize FCs were a think was Calculon, don't think he plays anymore. Solo tackling and FC;ing with the gang scimi and pulling it off... Back in I guess 2009.
---
Okay you got me here, there are no new groups, Eve is dying.
---
I came back when it said that there were 16 days remaining. I claimed the rewards every single day. It said "13/16" and "3 days remaining". But the last day remaining is the last promotion day. So, it said "15/16", 10 hours remaining. You can't get the last day reward if you started exactly 16 days earlier. 
---
I went Omega for the 1M skill points and found out the very final day about this.
---
It's a publicity scam or CCP engineers need to learn how to count.
---
I hate it when people replace the head with the full bee and not just its head. Why?

I mean I think people understand why it looks like it does, it just doesn't change the fact it is ugly

---
You mean like the OP? His isk making is completely shut down and he's so mad he typed out an entire essay about how he's really the one "trolling".
---
where did u see this
---
Some hobo leaks thing a while back first. Also sisi I think had this change there
---
You do realise every hunter SIG in Goons will now make it a sport to hunt you? I'd say there's probably now a wager on, behind the scenes, already. :)
---
No one can mine an entire region at once either, but it doesn't stop people from using it as an argument via delve.
---
As a semi experienced player, I advise you not to listen to these folks telling you not to make something new.  This is eve!  Make your merc Corp.  Hire yourself out to small corps that get war decked.  Hire yourself out as closely scouts collecting Intel in pipelines between warring mega coalitions. Hire yourself out as a harrassment fleet, dropping bubbles on move ops just for the lolz.  Invent new and interesting ways to provide a service.  The best experience in this game, or in life, is bought with risk and loss.  Never give up trying to create a new way to play this game, and never measure yourself against someone else's standard for "winning"
---
Hey Asher:)
---
It takes a long time to move fleets this big, across the galaxy.
---
Spectre Fleet is really cool.  I joined one of their fleets a couple days ago.  First fleet in probably close to 5 years.  Was tons of fun and really chill.
---
ive missed your posts gentle. really enjoyed the Spire ones :)
---
I still don't get why capitals would gate through Delve at all, let alone in war time.
---
it's better gameplay than afk ratting all day and my mains aren't getting much content so it's actually been fun? playing a video game has been fun? is that... bad????
---
We did.  In a tribe this large, there will always be people who do whatever they want.  That's one of the most beautiful things about the Imperium.  We give zero fucks about killboards, and there is room for anyone who is willing to undock and take risk.  Do krabbing losses matter to us in the grand scope of things? Not really.  They are among the many reasons our economy thrives...as does our tribe.  Perhaps the rest of you should be asking yourselves whether your metrics for "winning" this game are relevant at all.
---
Oh I could’ve, but you know, the whole busy... at work... doing work, didn’t have the 15-20 minutes to babysit 33 characters remotely.
---
Fuck off
---
I got screwed as well on a few accounts. I wish they had been a bit more specific. RIP some sp.....
---
and tell me, the times we call frat. is it vs just 1 coalition, or is it when we have multiple coalitions (test and goon) moving on us.
---
This shit needs to go back to middle school or twitch or whatever cesspool it spawned at.
---
I wasn't even flexing, just stating the current state of affairs.  
---
100b is less than trivial at an alliance level.
---
Then if you didn't want to bother to log in, you don't get the rewards. What part of this don't you get..?
---
only way Horde would team up with test is if the objective is killing GOTG.
---
something half of us secretly dream of
---
Post where?
---
Removing stab penalties on pvp ships would be cancer. Please no.
---
Which is the bigger factor at play: VNIs being broken ratting ships or goons being trash at PvP?
---
Not to be confused with the guys mining in delve that are still dying, or the ships dying as they are bumped off tether.
---
My main isn't in a blob. This is one of the few ways left to make isk with any relevancy to the rest of eve. Like I said, fuck renter landords, delete em. Let smaller alliances do it legitimately and I won't have to rent on alts...
---
The way the mechanics of eve work, there isn't really much in tactics for a fight as it's going on. Deployment, ship fittings and having a flight plan go a long way, but no there's really not much in the way of tactics. 
---
Best I recall was the smartbomb shield that protected a fleet from enemy missiles. That's a tactic. Getting in your T3 and following someone isn't a tactic, unless you're a lemming.
---
A bunch of blocs rent out internally to their own corps. You can't even escape renting in a blob lmao.
---
You shoot the Wyvern because it's shield tanked and shield tanked supers can't hold as well as armor tanked
---
Blue Ice
---
Yes, he is. My ticks are pretty shit now, though I'm one of the few ratters still out in Tribute. I don't mind though because I'm actually rooting for him and the attackers.
---
If the region falls, either I can try to take it with my mains and do it legitimately, or I find a new landlord since another blob will probably take the system. The latter fucking sucks but its probably the reality.
---
or the rest of tribute lol
---
&gt;Hire yourself out as cloaky scouts collecting Intel in pipelines between warring mega coalitions.
---
Hold on, is this actually a thing?
---
VNI ratting fucking sucks, the only plus is that its afk.
---
If active pve wasn't even worse I'd do that instead.
---
My supply may not be endless but i have enough to last the war replacing the ones lost by clueless muppets.
---
Humble brag
---
i went through every revision on sisi vs current tranq and didnt see it
---
Surprised it already hasn't. like I said though, I'm rooting for goons to boot the renters and their landlords out. If I wasn't so pessimistic about it being replaced by new ones I would be eager to get my alliance to try and take it ourselves.
---
The price has been higher for quite a while now. T1 structure rig demand has always been higher than for T2.
---
You can scale your salvage though, contaminated lorentz comes from dronelands and serpentis wrecks. Not enough Noctises and salvage dessies out there I guess.
---
Don't worry, you didn't miss much. Razor are kinda like Dinosaurs - relevant once upon a time but since went extinct and all thats left of them are some birdbrains.
---
And goons got their teeth kicked in. Lost a titan in your main home system lmao.

That was something I didn't understand recently. I've posted various questions here to this game praised for being a "sandbox" and "the game is what you make it!" attitude. I'm often met with "don't" and "it doesn't work".
---
Kind of conflicts with the constant narrative that delve invincible eh?
---
&gt; I honestly can’t recall seeing them..
---
Neither can anybody else and thats the joke
---
Hi Ron.
---
It was a Corp mate who saw it, I thought they said it was on sisi but guess not.
---
Given how hard TRI used to smack people left and right like 5 years ago i'd vote for WarGod
---
who says delve is invincible
---
This happened to Goons in the last war and they then proceeded to completely steamroll everyone. I don't think there's much correlation.
---
All day long reddit is bemoaning delve so powa. Delve unassailable. No one ever can best goons so big. But then all day long links of kills... like, isn't it great content daily?

&gt; And goons got their teeth kicked in.
---
if you think losing one titan is having your teeth kicked in, i hate to see what kind of vulgar language we'd need to describe what's about to happen up north.
---
That my friend is what nature calls "Darwinism". When we deploy, Darwin comes over to Delve to play
---
Rant inbound:
---
It actually shows CCPs utter ineptness at actually listening to their players.
---
Players asked for benefits to living in your space but literally not a single person asked for the crippling of offensive warfare, and somehow thats what we ended up with.
---
Your space is great, as long as you're in it, and the people in it remain relatively safe, but if your combat forces deploy in any fucking way outside of your borders everything burns in your house.
---
This as much as anything else has helped along the stagnation of EVE, whereas in the past you'd have a war or two a year kicking off in random places around the game, now as soon as anybody pulls out the big guns to go after somebody else their home becomes a smoking ruin.
---
Coupled that with the fact that you get NOTHING out of invading anymore (I mean honestly some of the shit you have to 'kill' doesn't even give you a fucking mail anymore to show you were there) and that all space is basically the same, you end up with a situation where offensive wars are a joke.
---
You wait for somebody to invade, pull up anything that you can stand to lose and go burn their home.
---
Meaning what, they reset your ADMs?  Big fucking deal those take like a week to reset and everything is back to normal because the invader can't keep what he takes and he's probably gotta head home to put out a 4 alarm blaze.
---
So yea, thanks for listening Hilmar, glad you're on top of the pulse of the game.
---
As long as Goons are home, Delve is for all intents, constructions, and purposes invincible, the second they leave its a firey heap, but nobody cares because the damage is easily fixable, and on the other hand they can't do anything with what they flatten up north because they dont want that space since all space is the same and they already have Delve set up.
---
His boner for us is too legendary to do otherwise.
---
damavik sucks but assfrig might be good
---
kiki too op. most things wont fight it unless they have an absurdly high chance to kill you since your so squishy; fast cruisers and any rlml/even lml jackdaws fuck you up.
---
tanky ab armor fits are pretty good for lowsec too but unless with friends kitey mwd is kinda weak cuz its not frigate fast to catch stuff as easily and isnt really tanky for bigger stuff that can apply at range
---
I'm ok with the whole "name and shame" concept here.    
---
    
---
Keep posting em up!
---
woah woah woah, propless Thrasher is cheating, I did 4 successful laps around outer and inner edges in a non-stabbed freighter.
---
So you're yet another biased moron who doesn't actually know anything about the organization you scream so hard about.
---
How in the hell is Fountain closer than Geminate?
---
Basically, people have played the game too long and they (at least think) they have figured it all out. And probably they are mostly right. Just because you can do something, doesn't mean it will work well. I.e. I can try to sell pizza by the side of the road IRL, but I'm probably not going to be successful at that.
---
Also, most people are very risk averse, especially people who have been playing eve for any length of time.
---
As a followup, if he doubleclicked in space while cloaked, would that not have helped considerably in letting him dodge decloak attempts even with the triangulation?
---
Are frigate only wormholes all shattered wormholes? With no way of anchoring a structure in it?
---
Losing a Titan is getting your teeth kicked in? What year is it, 2007?
---
Doesn’t help I guess that people like me hoard abyssal loot and BPCs hoping for the triglavian blops :)
---
Imbor... that’s all

Sort of, but not exactly. More like harnessing the power of the ultra crabs and their money by letting them die being stupid so they have to give that money to the pvpers who are actually contributing to combat.
---
"but we had to bring those bling Proteuses! There's only like three pilots between them!"
---
There is really no point not to if you ask me. The price is just going to keep going higher and higher as the demand for the new ships increase, this includes the BPCs, since they will be needed for inventing the T2 variants.
---
Congrats on winning EVE.
---
Garst Tyrell? You serious? Given, last time I had the displeasure of him doing the "I'm an angry FC, scream scream yell fucking do this, no this.... Why you fucking dead, your shit....." etc was 8 years ago give or take, but a top FC he most certainly was not. Wasn't terrible, but not top line.
---
Again, many years ago, but Sister Bliss impressed. First FC I flew with that would be multi boxing 3 or 4 accounts, like fc, getting warpins with a covert, doing something else. 
---
Shadoo, old PL, never flown with but we've all seen the armour HACS vid

Bring on the damage control mutas, that’s the next isk injection I get assuming they drop in my filament type

Is this like one of those Facebook things where someone random gets a Toyota 4Runner? Because I love those giveaways and share them without fail.

It’s always nice to go out on your own terms. Sounds like you had fun doing it also!
---
So Andrew Xadi for wormholer CSM candidate?
---
don't use facebook, can't relate :(
---
You won good job
---
Been great flying with you mate. Sorry to see you leave.   
---
But we will meet again in dual universe.
---
&lt;3
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
That fit deserved to die
---
Are you unironically arguing that mining isn't scalable
---
sorry to see you go mate. gl where ever the winds of life takes you. 
---
ps. Facebook is a curse, I dont have it either
---
Vinny D*
---
already gave everything away but you may win the 5b
---
To be honest... if only.
---
Can you imagine if Tribute was a ruse and they go push Sort's shit in? I'd have to be all "wtf I love goons now"
---
I'm just here for the free 5bil
---
Good luck with with your irl character!
---
It was more like PamFam were out-formed and docked up. PL, Horde, GOTG, NC, MC et. al. abandoned Fade &amp; Cloud Ring. Goons steamrolled undefended space. Sort was suckered out of some faction forts (Goons were going home anyway because even Goons wouldn't try that during AUTZ). This war will be like the last. Structure bashes till people stop logging in to ref shit. After Goons leave, NC will probably find someone weaker alliance to beat up and make themselves feel better. I'm thinking Deklein in August.
---
We will be here if you decide to return. Enjoy your time winning eve.
---
Glad you went out having fun! Always better than salt. o7
---
Deploy 30k players to fight 3k players..... can't figure out why no fights?
---
No let me guess, your all there to "honorable 3rd party".
---
Here's a thought, go home and bear it up then.....
---
F  
---
you will be missed, fly safe o/
---
Amateurs study tactics. Professionals study logistics.
---
.
---
I dont mind the minigame nearly as much as I mind traveling from can to can 50km apart.
---
It's better to burn out, than to faaaade away!
---
NO COME BACK!
---
YOU HAVE BEEN CLEANSED OF THE TAINT OF KSPACE BY BOB'S HOLY ~~FIRE~~ TORPEDOES; THE TRIBUTE HAS BEEN PAID!
---
NOW BE REBORN ANEW IN THE LAST VESTIGE OF FUN IN THIS GAME ^btw ^^beans ^^^is ^^^^recruiting
---
I can tell you are a man of taste.
---
fully agree, EVE needs a real reason for blocs or anyone for that matter to fight other than killboards.  Make EVE have real consequences again.  These days everything is so replaceable that no wars really matter too much.
---
hi i shooted ur caps gib isk pls
---
I like that 😂😂
---
Make sure you are using the right driver, I don’t know your specs so I can’t tell you much. I would look it up though
---
So long and thanks for all the crabs.
---
Aaand he deleted.
---
Just a less-agile-than-a-BC Vagabond, too slow to run, that cant hold tackle on anything, nor tank it, nor apply well its already shitty dps, and no optimal to at least kite tacklers that will web it. Lack of ADC is the least of its problems, tbh. But, hey, if you got them cheap, thats cool. o/
---
complaining that login rewards require you to log in doesn't make sense to me.
---
&lt;3 thanks for showing up and good job on the hole control :P
---
I feel bad about scouting out your anchoring forts now. :(
---
What can I say but you're welcome
---
YEETT
---
The moment I saw the screenshot
---
I went back to game to check again if there are any methods to hide active modules
---
And checked KM
---
Well, that Tengu did only have one covert ops
---
Glad you went out with a bang man! See you in 3-4 years when you get the itch again:D
---
All Razor ever really did was hide behind others and talking tough.
---
Good luck...I quit eve ...came back....quit eve...came back....haven't quit yet.
---
Enjoy your new found 8 hours of daily free time !!
---
Don't upvote, just want a chance at the 5bil isk. I'm new so I could help, I would use it to just by a bunch of Ares and go roam nullsec looking for fights to get better at PvP.
---
If they even undock, that is.
---
Yeah that all seems fair. But I went out and had fun with it instead of just taking an interceptor up to 6rcq which was my original plan.
---
At least you used your assets for something memorable! Good luck!
---
rzr space
---
more like legacy space
---
Dont worry, you’ll come back eventually
---
Fly safe irl o7
---
Fly Safe...
---
I’m glad you went out in a fitting end. Congratulations, hope life treats you well moving forward friend
---
I remember seeing a penis on the moon, or was that another system lol
---
Depends it you can nuet it out i guess because ive seen some tank stupid amounts of damage
---
Yeeeeehawawww
---
nah, don't be, it was way more fun than if you didn't &lt;3
---
i actually found a replacement - Dual Universe, can't say much about it becouse of the NDA but DAMN does it looks like a worthy eve replacement
---
Your going to regret leaving and giving away all your stuff, you may want to leave now! But what about in a few months/years
---
I believe he's floating the idea of deleting stabs altogether. Not the penalties.
---
I kinda like them for safe travel, but that's also a big reason to delete them.
---
nah, i did pretty much everything there is to do in eve, if i ever come back i'll want to start from 0, it's way more fun
---
Depends how you're scoring.
---
Isk per hour is down, it fun per hour is up.
---
OP is now more likely to show up for ops and fight. Mittens preaches the opposite.
---
gg
---
t. dni pilot
---
I am just providing some juxtaposition so you can see how stupid your argument was.
---
It is and it isn't. Some of the more independent stuff requires a lot of work and more dedication than most people are willing to commit. If you can pull it off, then eve is absolutely what you make of it. But without some help, usually it burns out quickly.
---
Get experience, figure out what you want to do, and find like-mindeds who want in, and you have a decent shot.
---
can i have your stuff
---
How will they ever recover?!
---
o7 good luck bud
---
Yes
---
Thanks
---
I see, so your time is worthless.  Most people value themselves so I guess if you have no self-respect it is free.
---
Get rekt baddie
---
well its was nice mining in TPAR-G thanks delve us renters thankyou for the kills and mostly that lovley moon ore THANKS [https://i.imgur.com/osTH37O.png](https://i.imgur.com/osTH37O.png)
---
You’ll be back someday..
---
You win brother Eve player, fly safe into the void!
---
Been a while since we had a good swastika. /s
---
Garst is a great FC lol, easily a top line
---
Wait what?  Did I miss the free stuff lottery?
---
It is good you are asking for input before making the time investment. I second diving into your vision if that is your passion, but know it takes time, work, and commitment whether it is solo or building a team. Hit me up in game if you want to talk further
---
lol, made u form
---
Isn't it kind of sad for an invasion to be ending this fast?
---
No one in Legacy gives a fuck about RZR
---
A little bird told me he's back...
---
yeah if you want more propaganda perhaps ask the mods why this was taken down before anyone got to see it. i haven't got time to do that right now i'm off to work. after spending my free time to create it this morning.
---
Who do you want to stabilze the player driven market?  If you CCP then its no longer player driven...
---
&gt;Goons steamrolled undefended space
---
Oh yeah? Was X47 undefended too? What happened there?
---
Unwatchable video bud.
---
Baited on a free 5 bil
---
Depends if you are consulting Texas Law or Bird Law.
---
i promise to use my 5b to buy 100 million t1 frigates so i can get good at pvp.
---
See you say that but eve is forever, in a year or two your going to be sitting there thinking "gee I sure am glad to be existing right now" and it will hit you, that sudden *need* to blow up internet spaceships and you will know the true meaning of CCP's "eve forever" video.
---
If you wanna go in the way back machine:

I actually gave a presentation about the history of FCs last Fanfest, but I'm having trouble finding the video of it.

Report them or shoot them a lot.  Make them move due to losses and then report them 😉
---
Entry.
---
Bye!
---
goonspeed
---
Have fun winning EVE!
---
that's why i recommend new super pilots get an aeon, then they will be part of the whole battle instead of getting knocked out early :P
---
I love how anyone that works with imperium are "goon pets". Panfan propaganda is all ways amusing.
---
you recognize the difference between it being free content versus unassailable via sov right?
---
hi im dentass
---
It's not like 10% tidi structure fights are really a thing to look forward to.
---
&gt;I dont mind the minigame nearly as much as I mind traveling from can to can 50km apart.
---
I make sure to drop a Bookmark further out than 150km, as I'm warping in (you can do it by hitting Alt+B then hitting the confirm button on the Bookmark window when the Warp in says you're around between 1000km and 10,000km.).   
---
That Lets you warp quickly back and forth between the Distant cans.
---
Hi goon pet
---
Everyone is different. I've been waiting for this since we got gifted 40 faction forts.
---
See? Players never cared about monocles being overpriced, they just wanted them to be visible in space. CCP 2 - Players 1. Enjoy fashion supers while the game continues to stagnate.
---
Can I have ur stuff?
---
Good luck, bro. Thanks for going out with a bang
---
Mr krabs- i like money
---
See you when you come back! One does not simply win EVE. The poison runs deep in your blood now.
---
With that many core stabs he's probably got a lock range so gimped he can't realistically lock anything.
---
lol cute.
---
easy groot
---
This was some next level cringe shit posting
---
Dang
---
I want 10b
---
Send female exotic dancers.
---
Nooo, stay in the north, only now I moved my cyno alts to Delve.
---
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqMl5CRoFdk) you go
---
Is this what winning looks like?  
---
(newbro here, honest question)
---
Best way to play is playing like it's your last time playing. The EVE community will miss you
---
BUT DOES IT CONSUME SKILLPOINTS
---
that depends on what your goal is
---
o7
---
Any FC from MC was fun to fly with. 
---
Omniwar from 2003/04, one of the games best small gang tacticians I ever flew with. 
---
Presidio from Gods 03/04 was very good to fly with.  
---
Flew with a few in Curse alliance in 04 in VOTF damn good. Can’t remember his full name
---
Ender Hawks from Forsaken Empire. BrotherDeath from FE too
---
Makes me realize how much I miss my old friends.
---
So....can I have your stuff?
---
I need 10b
---
Hi o7
---
It took all of PanFam to evict a few hundred people? That's impressive! At this rate you guys might be worthy to hold some low sec SOV... ohh wait.
---
AAR from phoenix pilot: saw in pb Intel that rorq was in trouble. Yoloed my phonix to clear tackle. Almost got him back to safety. Now they turn to me. I coast into the athanor with seige on. They try to bump me away but I have a big ass. I snuggle up with the athanor. They bring in a bumping mach. I think it would be funny to initiate self destruct. FML how are ppl targeting me? I'm nuub. Didn't know that mechanic. I grabbed a caracal by then neck and went down fighting. GFs all around. 10/10 would yolo a dread again to help save ppl.
---
kinda ironic that this anti-spin is so much more cringe than the spin itself
---
It's not nice bait
---
Its gr8 b8...jeeze
---
I'll buy all the exotic dancers, Male in new eden with 5b
---
Second most fun thing after crabbing
---
I’ll bring fireworks
---
North and South were more or less trading 2: 1 Titan till the extract was called and the true slaughter occurred. The winning moves by Goons was getting into a great position where the north couldn't focus fire, target calling and lock confirmation out of game. TIDI &amp; server issues meant that the north couldn't physically bring in more ships, despite there being a substantial capital reserve. That's where the North realized they could not bring sufficient force to bear and docked up. IIRC the final timer for X47 was undefended.
---
Vile Rat is getting his nipples clamped in hell right now. Rest in pieces you slimefuck

Holy shit if this isn't one of those "learn to walk before you try to run off a cliff" ideas than I dunno what is.
---
He wasn't great or even good but who gives a shit anymore. DBRB was fun to fly with.
---
Dual Universe is looking to be really good! Fly safe!
---
I hope you enjoy your retirement!
---
I will.rub your feet for 120bil
---
You understand the concept of me poking fun and divergent narratives and getting a laugh out of it?
---
So, did you do as instructed by Local?
---
I mean 18-20mil a tick isn’t all that bad as long as you don’t welp 500mil-1bil a day, personally I cover all my loses + profit with 1 vni alt and I normally fly faction cruisers worth 100-400mil..
---
Thank you for the fight! 
---
               -From Beans with Love
---
Yeah. Casino money stopped coming in when casinos was banned. tldr MBC was at best very loosely aligned with ISK being the main thing holding the coalition together, and once it stopped coming with no goons left in the north it was only a matter of time.
---
panfam: why would we even bother trying to defend the north from the bad goonies, they outnumber us 2:1!!!!!!!
---
also panfam: lol just batphoned everyone to try evict a 200 man alliance
---
Gj. And fly safe irl.
---
Just started playing Eve, and it sounds like it can be a hell of an experience...glad you enjoyed your run!
---
Content is always good, why so butthurt?
---
Fly Safe Capsuleer; the pull of the Real is the strongest force we know.
---
I really like the names you gave your citadels.
---
Best of luck in RL mate!
---
" There has been leaked plans of them potentially merging into Wildly Inappropriate of the Goonswarm Federation. " I mean, you can spin the situation in the favor all you want, you can even make up facts, which ya'll have been for a while, but at least make it believable? Like this isn't even trying anymore.
---
Noobman. Guy planned some pretty crazy ops. One of the best FCs I've flown with
---
Shadoo was always impressive
---
Flew with Mr Vee a few times and he was very technically gifted
---
I know you think you'll never be back.
---
But you're gonna be back.
---
so you're not gonna answer the questions?
---
i actually came up with them as a joke almost 2 years ago :P
---
Not sure how to win every just yet. Going out smiling is all I want.
---
Good luck and fly safe!
---
Just print it at a higher scale =P
---
so you ran away from tribute and a real fight to go pick on a few hundred man alliance with your 6,000 man strong coalition...damn you scary.
---
freeeeeeeeeeedooooooooooooooom!
---
You didn't like my answer?
---
Always sad to see a fellow capsuleer go, but here's to the memories and hopes you return someday!
---
Come back.
---
Give me the 5B.  When you inevitably decide to come back, I'll give it back to you (probably).
---
Never flew with you but I wish you the very best in the future!
---
The irony.
---
Good. Your wallet will thank you. :)
---
Winning eve
---
You seem neither salty or bitter, so I'm curious to know - What made you decide to move on from Eve? Just lost your taste for it, or was there a deciding factor?
---
For now.
---
Goons have given a LOT of those people titans
---
Seriously, delve is eve krabbing on easy mode.
---
Goon pet bad

sad thing is that i still have like 4 months of subs on 10 accounts -_-

6 months afk after 7 years and I’m fighting the urge to rejoin every day. I doubt I will ever be the same again. I quit smoking 6 years ago and it feels the same. I know I’m addicted. It’s just hard when you are used to playing 10+ hours a day for so long. I could never be a casual player at the level I played. My accounts combined are over a billion sp. With my job and family demanding all of my time all I have now is the subreddit to give me my fix.
---
shame, i wish you luck in your ventures though
---
I heard they were going to move in with their amazing bros Lazerhawks, listen to ksig’s sweet baritone singing, and brawl outrageously with the other 10 people who live in wormholes :-)
---
Enjoy your time winning Eve mate!
---
What's your favorite capital ship?
---
o7 good luck
---
So what is your plans for coming back? Solo PVP in Lowsec?
---
No, I mean I wish the Rokh in-game wasn't so small relative to the other battleships. It's less than half the size of the Megathron. I get that Caldari ships are so much more efficient and use better shielding and better tech than everyone else (Caldari btw) but a lot of their stuff looks really undersized.
---
enjoy your ban
---
i pretty much did everything there is to do in eve, from flying a frigate to Octupleboxing caps and supers in huge tidi fuckfests, from hs mining to ns rorq mining, from scanning to bfg-ing heavens in titans, i lived in hs,ls,ns,whs, i played f1 monkey and i fcd, from doing pos reactions to building supers, firesales, dropping a keepstar, running incursions and i'm probably missing a half here. I also started playing [DU](https://www.dualthegame.com/en/) which is awesome and seems like a potential eve replacement
---
Fly safe on the other side!
---
congrats on winning!!! :)
---
Out of curiosity, how'd EZCO manage the Delve life AND keeping a WH?

Was there much point, or was it just for schnitz'n'giggles?

with this many stabs the ticks are half that.

You'll be back!

nah, if i ever do i'll want to start from 0, it's way more fun than having everything
---
PRAISE BOB
---
Gud bye brooda
---
what did you name your keepstar?
---
I just plexed and could use 5bil :$

Agree with this. Please stay in the North awhile, it was a pain in the ass to move all these ships to Delve and we've only just started the krab-killing.

Winning Eve is an achievement bro. Congratulations. Have fun on whatever you do from now on. o7

thx for the isk
---
There is stuff for a newbro to look forward to.
---
All the best.

I don't have to pay for 10 more days so by then I should know how the camping is going to play out. But none of the renter landlords actually protect their renters, this is well known. You pay for the space and are on your own for the rest.
---
If it looks like the landlords are leaving the region yeah I wont pay em, what are they going to do, evict me from a system they cant defend themselves?
---
Don't live there if you can't defend it.
---
Said the 40k+ coalition who has legacy as backup against nc/ph? Lol
---
That is some completely impossible to understand crap

Fly safe! 7o
---
Hey at least he's trying and adapting, albeit slowly.
---
It's not a poor fit if it works. Fit for the task at hand and all that.
---
Don't live there if you can't defend it. I hope you give the attackers a good fight. Follow the rules of Eve and don't undock ( or put in a wormhole ) what you can't afford to lose.

Criticizing one meme with another... we have to go deeper.

I tried to give you a non-reddit character opinion of the reasons PL did what they did, based on real people who play a game. 
---
&gt;I understand the kind of content PL wants is punching down only.
---
The only thing you know is what other retards on reddit post.  We are more active by basically any metric that tapi or goons or anyone else, so it's pretty clear you don't know jack shit about what PL wants. But that's about par for the course here.
---
That's the joke, NCPL trash talks about us picking on the "little guy" and then they go find the littlest guy they can and slap them around while talking shit about how easy it is evict them. Pot meet kettle, get ready to be sitting on the curb next to them holding a homeless will work for food sign.

Glad you went out on your own terms. Enjoy the slightly more realistic IRL mmo. I hear it has some bad balance and design problems though...

Never piloted a Drake are they fun? I read about people memeing on them.

Somebody can explain me how to make a comment on this website? Because I am poor

Why would a titan pilot want to join with a bunch of scrubs?
---
how many ecm drones was there ? 15?
---
Gratz on winning, should have stayed in wormholes and turned into a spooky goon
---
Can goons not afford a heavy dictor with a focus point script?
---
Wtf? Snuff are an elite small-gang lowsec pirate alliance.
---
Yeah, if CCP could just ban people from anchoring mobile depots in Jita that would be greaaaaaaat.
---
I don't enjoy taking a minute to undock from station, nor hearing my computer cry its last when I try and warp anywhere.
---
Leaving EVE is how you win the game
---
Well, I guess this is goodbye until you decide to start playing again.
---
Mukk fleets are always a blast. Absolution and Astarte are still in my top 10 on zkill from his fleets in 2016.

---
Yeah, that's just a recipe for failure, disappointment, and burnout. It's okay to tell someone that they should wait and gain experience first.
---
Sadly, yes. Cloaking camping is a BS mechanic but you can make a pretty penny doing it.
---
Somebody’s going to promote on a study of social commentary in Jita.
---
Wonderful!
---
Shield tank is actually vastly superior to armor, but only if you have the cap to run your resists. Heating a-type adaptive invulns considerably outperforms full racks of heated X-Type armor resists. The main issue with shield is that no cap = no resists, and since armor gets adaptive membranes as passives they are much more resistant to neut pressure.
---
That was a thing in UALX, where Legacy shield supers were able to survive some of the less coordinated volleys by heating in time. One Rag managed to tank 38 DDs and survive by heating. Panfam was too far to neut the supers, and couldn't neut them while they were tethered to the (dying) Keepstar.

These were my exact words

Praise be

Wait wait come back, CCP isn't finished breaking things yet!?!

Srsly though, gl w/ rl - o7

I thought I was winning eve but it just ends up being a short break. Good luck on moving on and I hope you find what you were missing.
---
Who cares? It was a baller move to get him based on a screen shot. Fuck that guy
---
We're not saying "don't". We're saying "shouldn't".
---
Yes you, as a self-described novice, *can* start your own corp from scratch without any experience or understanding of how corps work. More power to you. But if you don't have that experience and understanding, gained primarily by being part of a well-oiled machine and seeing how it ticks, you're all but doomed to failure. And that failure is going to dishearten you and might make you just quit EVE and none of us want that.
---
We're not telling you "don't do this", we're telling you "don't do this *yet*". You asked for advice and we're giving it, as honestly and openly as possible, so that you have the best chance of success.
---
Wh Life best life. Congrats on winning eve and quitting like a boss. You reminded us all that's it's just a game and therefore should play it like that. Have a good life sir
---
I’m reading ‘novice player creating a mercenary defence corp’ and I’m thinking
---
**SPAI!!!**
---
IME if someone has to ask a question like this then they shouldn't be doing something as monumental as trying to run a corp.
---
If you actually have the experience and the understanding necessary to be able to succeed at running a corp then you have the experience and understanding necessary to answer this question for yourself.
---
His biggest mistake by the looks of things was to be sitting at 0ms. Even if you're cloaked you should be moving. It might have helped in this case, although it's still great work to even figure out the spot in the first place.
---
Chances you'll be back within a year?
---
It's an Amarr ship.
---
I imagine that's slave blood.
---
Black Legion does pretty good mercenary work. Maybe study them?
---
Maybe Unspoken Alliance can have Tribute, once we take it off NC.? :P
---
Uhhhhh you guys just run away from endless amounts of content
---
TAU AD of course!!!!! Like non other FC i ´ve ever flown with there is a perfect balance between real good preparation / overview / adaption of changings etc. and "fuck it let´s go in and kill stuff!", because it is not about the victorys only but having fun too!
---
eeehhhhhhhh waffles had this odd thing for a while where they would. i think they still might but i havent flown with em for years.
---
Right cause that little guy didn't drop citadels all over space that ncpl owned and that little guy didn't sov wand a bunch of shit. No one ever even heard of or knew about them untill they did that. But yes ncpl picked on them, please continue your retard spin
---
Well. Mindless from Outbreak was a blast to fly with
---
In terms of Tacticians I would say Marko D. was one of the best of his time
---
How does it feel to win EVE? Enjoy your freedom my man
---
Free stuff????
---
I love lamp!
---
forgot about this part - i also donated a [cyno alt](https://zkillboard.com/character/2114314401/) for it with a golden monocle
---
i mean, i'm kind of switching one addiction to [another](https://www.dualthegame.com/en/) here :P
---
Hmm so maybe what about joi ing the goons to krab in safe? Or Test maybe? Or what do you think?
---
Wish you luck.
---
“elite” lmao
---
I though grinding structures was something everyone was excited about to really stick it to panfam. Surely that wasn't all just talk on reddit?
---
Rule number 1, never underestimate the other guy's autism.
---
It’s always fun to go out with a bang.   Good luck on your next adventure.
---
Let's look at some goon pets what has lawn, bastion, and tnt accomplished in the last 5 years? I think tnt was in the AT with some caracal that anchored on the FC.. apart from that they all ratted a bunch and paid a bunch of taxes to goons. Looks alot like a pet to me
---
If someone is stalking you while you do this they can uncloak while you are warping back in, and not have to worry about their lock delay.
---
You can almost hear the carebears beckoning you to their empire mission-fleets.
---
Why would you do this D: That looks amazing!
---
This kids is called a sound investment.
---
The citadel spamming issue is not an issue but a feature!
---
We should all feel honored yeah?
---
You never really win eve! Remember this!
---
Hmm... well HS planets are dry, but even on these screenshots I can see that the L5 shows more precisely where the hot spots are. The L4 shows it as well, but it's a more approximated "blurred" version of it. Explains why I have to move the heads manually around the hotspots and still get huge differences in yields evne though the hotspot coloring doesn't correpsond to it.
---
Well... now the question is whether I wanna keep on moving the extractor heads around half-blind or save myself the headache and just max the planetology on all my characters... :D Tough choices, eh?
---
People underestimate the Vedmak, I have flown it in small gang.  It had substantially more tank than the women a d vector I was with and quite a bit more damage.  At the time however it didn't make up for the hull at 200mill and the weapon at 100.   It was essentially as much as a HAC
---
Sorry to see you go!  Did not know you in game but hope your RL adventures are fun!
---
Baittttttt.
---
For how long will you win eve?
---
They prob will be stoked for free titan kills
---
Best of luck. Sad to see a pilot go.
---
That's quite the exit
---
surely you didn't fall for the bait post?
---
But with such assets you could do whatever you want, why are you stopping on purpose?
---
Yeah but who else is filthy enough to RP like dirty Boonies?
---

#equalitynotwithstanding
---
Thanks for helping create excellent content. See ya in a year or so when you get some EVE cravings ;)
---
Long Regional gates make it pretty quick to get to fountain
---
Nah we ran to it. You ran north, away from it.
---
I'm just going to add here that regardless of where you go, success in eve is about finding a place you fit in. So join a corp, and give it a chance, but remember you're not stuck there. If you're not enjoying it, go somewhere else until you find a good fit for you.
---
Hell no.
---
GivePlz thankis for ISK. BTW nice last hoorah.
---
F
---
And to mess with.
---
I like to try new things occasionally. Keeps me interested ;)
---
rude
---
You will be back in 6 months or less, you might not bring all 10 accounts online but you will be back for the eve crack.
---
I know those feels.
---
fly safe in RL and don't get me wrong but: i hope you never come back o7
---
Some of the most fun Ive had in eve was throwing nightmares around lowsec with him.
---
Is that small thing an Aeon?
---
Fucking hell, Titans are huge
---
because piloting titans sucks ass? and that bunch of scrubs that killed 5 caps and 3 forts?
---
Always sucks to see people quit but at least you left in style. Nothing better than a drake to send yourself off
---
Requesting Money Badger Coalition to fight Goonies again!
---
Dang, grats on winning Eve. Best of luck to you in the future!
---
It's not the grind I object to. It's the fact that it takes hours in 10% tidi. I have other shit to do with my time.
---
Sorry to see a pilot leave Eve o/

---
great work
---
I don't doubt that null games suck, but so does waiting in fleet for five hours just to drop on three Sabers and lose half a dozen bombers.
---
So what was your favorite part? If (when) you come back, where will you start back up?
---
Part of the issue with the question, is you're talking about past FC's. So there are plenty of FC's still around, who were also great in the past.   
---
If it's the later definition, then I'd say Asher Elias is one of the best FC's in our game hands down. It was he that defeated PanFam capitals during the end of the Casino War. It was he that got some of the best wins in the lead up to the previous wars.  
---
Also, Jay (everyone's gay for Jay), lead Goons to victory in the last Northern Epidemic war against PanFam.  
---
These (and there are others) are the FC's who make history.
---
i guess you keep staying north then. 
---
Yesterday i had the best fleet in like two years iam totally cool with you beeing where you are. On the other hand delve is courently on fire aswell. I mean we basicly killed three fleets and a dread in less then 2h fleet. So time will tell.... sadly i think at one point you will come back before delve is ashes
---
Do you always expect to get things for free and without effort?
---
But no, not really. You roll off all incoming wormholes, D-scan constantly and fit a MJD. If any new sigs pop or you see anything on D-scan you get out. If you have a cloaked alt on the static it is even safer.
---
Rolling 7 days
---
What about Avocado Law?
---
Didn't know there was a compilation of the filters. Thank you sensei Intigo. Very helpful
---
two years and you were a cap pilot?! 
---
i'm spacepoor btw so it should be this
---
Pl went from going after brave, to going after brave again, to taking a break to gang up on goons with everyone else in wwb, to going after brave again, and then to go after provi.
---
But yeah okay you guys are elite and haven't just spent all your time picking on the little guy.
---
When ones career ends, someone else's begins. Good winds
---
idk ) yeah they jammed me every time i decided to make some movement )  
---
altho i think that i may have survived becuz i was jammed and sat on gate 0 instead of chasing sth
---
Ok, haha, but this would be a more sensible choice when faced with undefended 7day structure timers.
---
Yeah that sounds really shitty which is why nobody does it
---
Showing off the finished part - smart guy
---
Thanks for the info....this helps a lot
---
Which one? Did a search for Black Legion and 70 results came up.
---
Take care bud
---
You need a better computer. But I agree ccp needs to do literally something about anything for a change.
---
Will you still visit r/eve?
---
Last time i checked goons didn't care about killboards.
---
Np! That list doesn't include /reset/, but you can get an idea of how that works if you click links on any Stats page
---
Or add /reset/alliance/ID where ID is the ID of an alliance you often fight on your own character page and you'll see
---
Narciss Sevar was p dope at his game.
---
You're Winner! Nice little sendoff, a sacrifice to the God's
---
Maybe make them one per ship, so they counter long-point, but nothing else.
---
"You killed three fleets"? I find that hard to believe. A fleet in Goons is like over 200 ships. What fleets are you talking about? I guess I wasn't there so can't comment but if you actually killed a proper fleet, it would be all over reddit.
---
They add some sand to the sandbox though. Unless something is completely broken in EVE (no clue about fw plexes right now?) I think it's good for it to stay.
---
#freegigx

considering how much cash they just sold the company for, it's not going anywhere.

Just read this and can’t log on to sisi cause I’m at work, fuuuuuuu

It is a 50/50 crapshoot if he is going to bomb to death an enemy fleet or blue fleet.

don't give anything , you will need them when come back

you will come back, have to come back

---
here you go friend
---
You don't miss anything :)
---
Actually, you seem to have won EvE. You've had your fun, and you seem to leave with a smile.   
---
Bonne Voyage, maybe you are as crazy as most of us, and return some day (you never know ;) )
---
Sure but if you get a nyx you don't have to sit thru 10+ hours of tidi
---
You are leaving, and I'm just coming into the game, I'm into my first week and I'm having a blast. This game is beautiful and I'm sure these years you spent in the game have left you some memories you can think of, from time to time. Was a pleasure and an honor reading your story, have a good life
---
Entry. Haha.
---
Congrats on winning dude.
---
I mean, the appeal of renting is that you have your own system and don't have to share it with a whole alliance.
---
I don't think any does. Pretty much impossible to anyways. Even Goons/Test/PH can't protect a VNI being dropped on with the standing fleets a couple jumps out.
---
Different for Rorqs maybe, but everything else you are on your own.
---
I watched about 5 minutes before my eyes started bleeding, but thats seriously sick man, you also might be insane.
---
You certainly went out with a bang.
---
tfw your move op started on saturday and it's tuesday and you're still not there yet
---
nice try Garst
---
we did tenal to tenerifis via the outer edge of the galaxy (trying to avoid being scouted as long as possible), in an afternoon
---
admittedly that was only about 100 titans but it turns out that when you tell people a week or two in advance, "we're deploying and there will be one move op only, it's next saturday, clear your schedule it'll take all day," everybody fucking shows up
---
Ah yes, a cloaky hictor that can take blops bridges (and also, I suppose, have a bonus to webs to keep the overpropped AB-fit in range).
---
Sure would be nice.
---
So many creative options when doing that, but he chose a cheap vulgar line. Just another retard
---
You’re an idiot if you think Roy is a “brilliant tactician”
---
Ahh okay, so you killed two fleets of b-team frigates and jackdaws defence and lost 1 Cruiser sized fleet yourselves. Not a bad strategy, taking the fight to Delve whilst most of the A-team pilots are busy moving.
---
It seems that most of people post here just to get 5 bil. Well.... I'll do the same
---
Im thoroughly enjoying the lack of PGL on this list .
---
“Goonswarm”
---
“A-team”
---
lol.
---
Wow 5B? Nice one dude :)
---
Good luck out of eve.
---
I'm glad you got to enjoy a part of the game to help send you off. It's better to go out with a bang instead of a whimper!
---
remember that the first tribute war and the fall of the old northern coalition (in 2010) was precipitated by xix paying pl an unprecedented 600b to do it
---
in theory, pl is still a mercenary alliance
---
in reality, there aren't a lot of people in need of the services of a mercenary group at the size, power, and cost of pandemic legion, and in order to stay at that size and power in today's eve you kind of have to own space and use it
---
if it weren't for the goons currently snail-crawling their way toward us, if a smaller group like triumvirate or mangos wanted to hire us to help muscle people out of their space, we'd almost definitely go if the price was right
---
Well, we'll never be as 'elite' as you of course. :P
---
My sentiment is probably biased because quite a number of games started doing it lately. Could have sworn Eve did it 3-4 times already.
---
Instructions unclear. Dick stuck in cucumber...
---
Yes 601 ships actually.
---
Good early wins, are necessary to keep your morale up, especially since your lines members wondered why you're freaking evacuating a whole region with tail between legs.
---
so butthurt he can't mine
---
almost made him pvp
---
Needs to be covert cloak too. If you see it landing you get a bunch of extra time to get out.
---
If i wanted to go from Delve to fountain in a frigate.. I can get there in about 10 minutes.. thats how its closer
---
We didn’t deploy or really do anything in Spire/ER at all until goons showed up. Not our fault they bailed to go to tribute instead of actually helping Unspoken.
---
Have A good one!
---
How do you get 601 ships from 370 in that report?
---
Yet you're here.
---
old school mc-style mercenary gameplay (i.e. mashing your structures with overwhelming force) could conceivably still exist, but there aren't a lot of people in need of the services of a mercenary group at the size, power, and cost of a group like that, and in order to stay at that size and power in today's eve you kind of have to own space, the safe use of which kind of demands that you create diplomatic agreements with your neighbors, which more or less cements you into the political chess board
---
remember that the end of mercenary coalition's heyday was when they decided that diplomatic ties to bob were weighing them down so they split off and created tortuga with kia in period basis
---
that was over 10 years ago, and it's only gotten worse since then
---
pos sov was brute-forceable by a large enough capital fleet, and MC being early adopters of the game with a large dread fleet were more than capable of doing so. dominion sov was similarly cheesable and pandemic legion did so with aplomb, particularly during the tribute invasion in which xix paid them 600b to evict the old northern coalition
---
fozziesov, however, requires a different sort of gameplay that is almost impossible to implement without living full-time in the contested area, which is really not what you hire mercenaries for
---
so in short, the game has changed to substantially favor just recruiting more people over paying someone else to fight your battles for you
---
Probably not the kind of advice you are expecting, looking for, or even going to consider heeding, but don't lock yourself into a single type of gameplay. Corps are way more than that. A good corp will outlive its members' (or leader's) interest in a single style of gameplay. As a leader, your job is to provide your members with content in a complete sandbox in return for their loyalty. Don't cripple yourself from the start.
---
O7 man, best of luck in life
---
Is DU really worth taking a shot on the 60/120€ cost on an alpha product? I'm kind of intrigued, but the price is kinda high...
---
I actually haven't seen any action as yet, just move ops. I guess there's a lot of Goons like me who are just playing with logistics at the moment. The bulk of our forces have yet to drop the hammer.  
---
I actually can't wait to get stuck in. :)
---
There's a solid tradeoff on stabs. You wreck your ability to do much at all with even just one or two. Notice how PvP ships basically never fit one, PvE ships with them are trading off considerable isk/hr and you can still beat stabbed fits with more scram than they have stabs. An Ishtar with 6 stabs is still vulnerable to bubbles, neuts, webs etc.
---
Play, counterplay, and counter-counterplay is a good thing, even here. Plus stabs are one of the few answers to cloaky camping, which is generally considered to have no recourse against it.
---
I don't want your money.
---
You just went from "I find that hard to believe; it would be all over reddit" to "OK it happened but those aren't our good pilots." (Is that why you're pulling SIGs home from Uemon?) 
---
Maybe just stop with the hurf and spin for the moment.
---
Have some wallstreet goon post biweekly videos where they talk about investmemts ingame while sounding like alex jones on cocaine
---
He’s back now, or at least some of them are. They’re all FC’s for the Mangos now, though, the rest of RnK is still dead.
---
There's not much point to trying to save a VNI from a blops gang, it's either dead or warping away long before backup arrives.
---
This is how you win eve by going out in style. Have a good one man!
---
PANFAM wouldn't be there if Goons and legacy didn't form for every major timer
---
Jeez, I really wished you had a smartbomb on you.
---
Ya that was bs I was in same predicament. Most of the time the events go on till a normal patch day.
---
what other people are telling you with regards to joining a functioning corp and seeing how it works before you start your own is very good advice, but they're missing another important bit
---
if you start a corporation and you don't have at least a handful of friends starting it with you, first of all it will be extremely difficult to recruit anyone as no one wants to join a brand new corp with only one member (i know this from experience - the first recruit is the hardest, and it stays excruciating until you have about 10 or so active members)
---
what's more, if you're the only person leading the corp, it will grind to a halt when you're not around. when you're at work, when you're asleep, when you decide to go out with the lads on a friday night, the gears grind to a stop
---
so join a corp and see how corps work, join a wardec corp and see how that works if you want, but also importantly make some friends who might come with you when you start off on your own
---
Enjoy the alpha test. Hope it's not a new No Man's Sky/Star Citizen style of thing. It sounds like you left because you'd done everything and were looking for the thrill of the "new"?
---
We are really trying, but every time we just end up giving them an astrahus =)
---
I heard they brought their rorqs too
---
That's why you stay cloaked while you're warping back in, so they aren't able to do this. Or better yet, if you know someone is stalking you (pretty easy to tell in K-Space), just sit at point, cloaked, and they'll never find you.
---
FTFY: “A fleet in Goons is like over 200 *mining* ships.
---
And pull off the greatest disappearing act in EVE.
---
Proper capsuleer goodbye party. o7 fly safe.
---
You'll be back. They always come back.
---
Off topic but did you really wrote "u're" ? Like you either write "you're" or abreviate it to "ur", "u're" feels wrong
---
See you later o7
---
with proper dual rep config drekavac is very tight on fitting
---
The numbers aren't to the nearest Anything, its to the nearest Boost, Hidden Node, or the Actual Mainframe. You'll never know when you're about to hit a Defense subsystem.
---
Can ur stuff i haz?
---
becouse it's boring when you already have everything
---
Was my first Null alliance. Ah the memories...
---
RZR are actually the armpit of eve.
---
Not remove it, simply add something else to the rotation, so you're not doing the SAME thing Hundreds of times.
---
GF dude, I think you could have taken that entire gang out if it was not for the ECM menace.
---
"Our values make us different!" -Horde Carriers in unison dropping on bombers to save a Horde HAW Dread that dropped on 10 frigates full Theta Style, probably :)
---
Saw the ping for this but just out of my tx, dam looked like fun.
---
he came back for about a month something like a year and a half ago, decided eve is shit, and quit forever iirc
---
Yeah, makes sense for a little balance. The ecm drones made me sad watching this though. Thank god they'll get nerfed.
---
I was in Init for a while and their main FCs, dark shines, Pando, Bliss, were all amazing at doing goku fleet. We’d routinely beat boosh eagles, and also were able to dunk a jackdaw fleet with a clever bubble placement setting up a bomb run that took out most of the fleet. 
---
I honestly think that those fleets were some of the best I’ve been on in the game in terms of how fun the fight itself was, and they’re the only ones I’d even consider interesting where I flew dps instead of logi
---
"Team A (601 involved)"

the game is far from done but it's already playable and the devs do seem to keep up with the timeline they've set. And yes, there just isn't much i haven't done in eve at this point
---
\+1 for video 
---
\+1 for goon baiting 
---
keep on doing the lords work
---
Damn dude how long have you played eve for?
---
So you really have Gotton off the Lawn.
---
Goodnight
---
You talk about the Casino War ?
---
Like others have said on here - it’s nice to see someone leaving on good terms rather than bad.
---
I’ve been playing EVE on and off for the last 13 years. There has always been something that’s pulled me back into it - the people. I’ve made some great friends through this game. 
---
I’m sure you’ll be back at some point ... maybe when you can replace your lost Titan with a faction Angel Titan ;).
---
In the meantime, enjoy DU. It looks pretty awesome. 
---
EVE will be here for you when you get back 😁
---
Please pick a narrative you are making my head hurt. Are you attacking because goons are there? Or are you attacking because they are nowhere to be found? I know goons are grrrrrreat I will not argue that, however we can't be there and not there at the same time.
---
[coalition list i used for the sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/birss7/00_coalition_list_may_2019/)

You've spelled "we don't care" or "it has no influence" wrong ;(. I understand that 1 Tril in a few days sounds alot for people ratting in VNI's, but it isnt ;(
---
More popular = more targets to hunt. Less popular = more sites for me. It’s a win win.
---
 Ok do you know how many Titans goons deployed already?      
---
Scans that i seen so far point to like 800 titans, but for sure i don't seen all.
---
If I win I will roam aroundd starter systems and give it away like it was christmas !
---
It came from playing all that Homeworld multiplayer
---
Could someone take a loot how much of these losses are secretly PanFam Alts ?
---
lmao what.
---
No it wouldn’t. For starters there is still no gate to stain
---
Goons can start officially pulling over a regions industry

i believe i said "a couple of years" as in more than 1, not necessarily 2, but i played since 2015

Nice to see a post where someone tells a story of great battles and a fun end to things rather than the more usual moans and groans. Hope life outside of eve brings you good luck.
---
Now onto the isk lol  /jk. 
---
Im rich enough and sure other people need it moar.
---
Fly safe sir o7
---
How many are titan mains
---
no skin on keepstar, . . . downvote
---
I was actually technically right, PanFam didn't destroy 3 fleets. It's an exception that it's also not all over reddit. If you  actually read the post in context, I said I find it hard to believe but hadn't looked, and was looking for the evidence. The NC guy provided the evidence. It's really not so hard to figure out dude.
---
Safe travels good sir
---
Yes we disavow the idiots who cant f1 and suck with the rest of us
---
5b plz?
---
Fixed! :)
---
I agree with this.  Goons where literally left to build Delve.  Had people just harassed them for a while after as you say just bashing a structure they kept building it would have killed morale so much
---
Scam? Please be some next level scam.
---
&gt;I mean we basicly killed three fleets
---
Fly safe IRL, brother! o7
---
Good to see Unspoken burn.

I think many titan alts aren't subscribed or just not being used. Pl with 61 Titans seems pretty unlikely too.

If anyone has experienced it yet, how come you need to, and can't repackage the Meatgrinder skins ? I just acquired some, but can't put them on the market because of this...
---
You know that many people quit from PL and PL acquired new corporations that don't have to be titan heavy.
---
Not gunna lie, these numbers just confirm goons won eve. Unless literally every power went against them, they probably wouldn't lose.
---
But that would cause the servers to melt and we'd all lose 😂
---
Sadly CCP nerfed them to hard, without compensation.
---
In the mind of beginner, there are many possibilities. In the mind of the master, there are few. Which is to say I think they're reacting to what is seen as your relative inexperience. 
---
You have to realize that "playing for a few weeks" in EVE is nearly identical to just starting out. You've probably been trained on games (and for that matter, other tasks) where that isn't the case. 
---
If you play WoW for a few weeks, you've basically got the game "down." You know where to go, what your class abilities are, and more or less how to play the game. Sure, you've got plenty of room to refine your skills, but you know the basic parameters of what you can do, how to do it, and what your goals are in actually accomplishing those tasks.
---
EVE is...not like that. After a few weeks, you have probably figured out one thing, if that. Usually, this is something like mission running, or factional warfare, or mining with a side of industry. This is not to say you've mastered it, but you've mostly figured out: you know what buttons to press, where to go, what your objectives are, etc. And this is the feeling you get in other games when you've "got it", and so you assume that you've "got it" in EVE. Sure, you've got some stuff to learn, but you'll figure it out. It's a video game, you've played *video games* before.
---
Let me stress that i'm not bagging on you. I was the same way, and so were most players. But this game is COMPLICATED, and I think what people are trying to communicate to you is that a player experienced enough to make any progress towards, let alone have any success in, a venture such as this wouldn't be asking the questions the way you're asking them
---
Between when I was at your level and now my understanding of the game has completely changed, so much that a not insubstantial amount of the difficulty in giving you advice would be figuring out exactly what you don't know, and in the course of finding out what that is, I think most people assume we're going to find out you ACTUALLY don't want to do what you are saying.
---
For example, what do you mean by "war"? From your comments it seems like you mean highsec war declarations. War declarations are only a small part of what EVE players mean when they say two groups are at "war" with each other, and the entities that are involved in such declarations are a very specific type.
---
If highsec wardecs is what you want to get involved with, you should do some research. Highsec politics doesn't get discussed a lot on this sub, but it is a thing, and you should definitely make yourself known to some entities before you just come screaming in with a "pay me a billion ISK to fight for you, stranger!" Who are the corporations you see declaring wars? Who is winning? Are the two groups evenly matched, or is it a dedicated wardec corp preying on noobs. Are those noobs even fighting back? Is there even a demand for your services?
---
Do you have people who are willing to do this with you? Recruiting randos from the trade hubs is probably not a good idea: anyone worth having won't want to do this unless they see you've already got an operation going, and anyone who does is probably going to quit when their shiny t2 fit pirate frigate is blown up on the Amarr undock by a bling t3c.
---
Beginning to answer these questions starts in the place most people have told you to go: join a corp. The people in the corp will 1) give you a group of people you fly with, and feel some solidarity towards 2) help enmesh you in a set of politics that can give you a goal and an understanding of the major players in whatever market you're trying to break into, and 3) help you figure out what you asked actually means in EVE. Do you want to help highsec wardec victims? Or do you just want to get paid to PvP. Do you want to want to operate a bunch of cloaky alts in nullsec camps? Or do you want to just join a coalition and have them pay you to do it. 
---
(the only actual dunk I offer is that if you've only been playing for a few weeks, your leet skills might not be as impressive as you imagine them. Again, it's not like other games where one well equipped/engaged player can aid a small group just by showing up. There are far better pvp'ers in almost any coalition that's engaged in serious conflict, and they fight for free)
---
I've never heard of DU before but upon clicking you link I see it's the first ever MMO. Not sure why anyone would just turn and run at that point but whatever. At the very least I get to tell sadus he's wrong about wow.
---
That's about right for PL.
---
Sure, numbers are lower then they used to be, but 61 can't be anywhere near the real number.
---
Solo roamers need to stay up to date with eve politics now, mate. Had you listened to the last Talking in stations podcast you would have known that going solo into nullspace is considered "farming" and is heavily frowned upon. You should listen to upcoming podcasts to stay up to date on roaming recommendations from the intergalactic council of political correctness: Vi-"I-have-a-military-background"-ly, Sort-"Why-is-a-known-traitor-not-treated-like-a-valued-ally"-Dragon and Dunk-"Bottom-of-the-fucking-dumpster"-Dinkle. A manifest on how to have meaningless but "fun" fights in nullsec is soon to be released.
---
Now excuse me, I have to go puke.
---
your video reco
---
Why not just setup wake-on-LAN? That + remote desktop gives you access whenever you need it.
---
Once apon a time they were actually a pvp alliance with a good rep, a long time ago though(8yrs?).
---
Legacy is missing a lot because they haven't used them. Probably won't for a long while until shield slaves are introduced.
---
Man I love the hacking mini game. It's super relaxing, like a sort of minesweeper. I only wish that the only place to do it where it's moderately challenging is places where I have to mash dscan/check local or otherwise always look over my shoulder.
---
"the T3 is a T3..."
---
What's the problem? Not snarking. Just asking.
---
Small gang lol
---
that's not the cloak trick

[yup](https://sjc1.discourse-cdn.com/eveonline/uploads/default/original/2X/9/9a395dad41a3cccfecd1346e6bc4aa48beb14442.jpg)
---
Mind telling a fellow nuub about the said mechanic?
---
Fawlty , most fun ive ever had.
---
It's no secret that goons can't tackle.
---
Ellatha seem more acurate. I think fuzzwork forgot thera, Shatered  and drifter WH.  
---
IMO, more user friendly database --&gt; http://anoik.is/systems
---
Trace who left and who joined.     
---
I don't say that PL have only 61 titans ... only that they lost many people with multiple titan alts.            
---
PL is shadow of it former self and PH could quite easily deal with PL if they had to (but i don't say that will happen especially that PL is holding hand over PH disband button).
---
Good luck bro.
---
The fuel used is pretty irrelevant tbh. I think the cost can quite easily be covered by the members of they have to. It's a pittance.
---
Those gin losses are also minimal. They take already replaced to a new level.
---
ive been playing this game since 2004 so i pretend i know a few things every once in a while.  the first thing, if you want to do it, then fucking do it.  this is a game, play it.  the second thing, if you dont know what you are doing, you are going to do it badly, bigly.  after you do it  badly, bigly, enough...you will do it badly.  a while later you will do it better.  so on and so on bla bla bla.  if you have the patience, the time, the motivation and the isk you can grow to do it like a boss.  the time between badly, bigly and doing it like a boss is the part where most people get frustrated and begin to lose interest.  your ability to overcome the obstacles will be the decisive factor.
---
having been a part of hundreds of wars over the years including a brief stint in Mercenary Coalition with my main and select alts the most important aspect of success is your ability to make contacts.  people will need to trust you before they are willing to shell out isk for your services as a merc.  how much effort will you put into it, how many pilots can you bring to a planned op, can you form an effective doctrine for your fleets, how can you handle tz tanks...etc.  if you just hit the "help war dude #1" on rando wars you arent going to get a lot of responses because you have no merit until you prove yourself.  this is the patience aspect.   
---
you are going to need a lot of isk depending on how you want to run things.  merc work is not cheap and to begin with you are going to need to be cheap as fuck because (see above)...maybe even start out with pro bono shit.  building a reputation is expensive.  gaining experience is more expensive.  figure out an isk income.  theres a thousand ways to do this, pick the one that is most fun (tolerable) for you.  i run incursions with one alt, have two reaction farms, 1 sp farm, 2 cap building lines and then 1 main that spends it all.  you can have all the plans in the world but if you cant fund them then they are nothing but dreams.  wars are not won with t1 frigates alone.
---
building a successful corp/alliance/coalition is a shit ton of work.  building any of the above is a shit ton of accomplishment.  in new eden, you get what you put in.  work at it, learn to do it better than anyone else does it and you will prosper.
---
this is all just my own perception of how things work.  after 14 years the only thing i can say with certainty is that nothing else matters except how much fun you are having doing whatever you are doing.  if you have fun building a war dec group then do that...if you have fun sitting in a station for months station trading, do that.  go have fun.  some of my best fun was done while i was losing.  go lose a shit ton of ships...learn from every mistake, every loss...dont get stupid serious to where things get unfun.  
---
my main in game is moebeus.  i am a goon.  if you can see past that imperfection and want further help accomplishing what you want to do, mail me.  good luck with your future prospects, whatever they may be.
---
I prefer to call it a tactical withdrawal rather then ‘eviction’. E.R and The Spire are slowly being populated by Panfam meat-shield pet alliances and I for one can’t wait to start the cycle of harassment all over again!
---
does that mean if goons return to delve you will stay and continue to fight? :)
---
\^ Same question. Tengu with depot and refit. Go hunting for low sec DeD sites.
---
Expensive to fly both Isk and time wise (though admittedly a Stratios can be too with the right fit), and tend to be a huge target for Hunters. Its probably Overkill for Low-Sec ratting anything, I'd think. 
---
Not that they're bad Ships, mind you.
---
 Good luck
---
how do people still get baited by your posting michael...
---
Being bought by Pearl Abyss does not bode well for a chance at any *good* changes in business decisions.
---
Not arguing with you about that since we actually agree. It's just that some alliances have used their toys more then others the last 3 months, so these numbers are rather tricky to compare. Hard to tell the real numbers when you are not leadership in an alliance (and even then).
---
The 400 odd billion isk of stuff blown up in Delve in the few days since Goon's super umbrella deployed suggests Delve krabbing isn't safe either.
---
lucky its not 6.9
---
how did you get so space rich?
---
Stratios is your safest bet
---
in null bomber does the trick. With a TP it kills cruiser and battleship NPC just fine.
---
In Lowsec, where frigate and cruiser NPC are prevalent, an astero could work.
---
maybe not include renter alliances when talking about coalition titan numbers?
---
I was there already before you deployed so yea.
---
Im with the imperium so i figure if we dont have enought faxes to deal with with nuets i fucked up
---
&gt;especially that PL is holding hand over PH disband button).
---
You keep saying this and it just gets more retarded every time, PL does not hold any leadership roles in Horde, its been years since any relevant PL member had any power over Horde
---
With BOTS should fight CCP
---
Supers and titans are the only thing that matters these days.
---
Since the Imperium has deployed we've killed multiples of each and lost none, so we are clearly winning.
---
I suspect those goons numbers are massively under estimated. Nearly everyone I know has a Titan thats not used unless war is called
---
I too want 5b
---
Beans did it, the scrubs that they are.
---
Congrats on winning Eve, I've tried but I keep losing.
---
why would you want to stay in a max tidi battle though
---
This might be better advice if there were actually any merc war corps that are recruiting. As a veteran player, I've been looking for this exact thing for the past couple weeks, and practically no-one is recruiting, except a couple of the corps that have merged into pirat, and even then, pretty casually.
---
Helps when there's actually someone to follow. I've been looking for highsec merc war corps for the past couple weeks, can't find hardly any
---
you mean goons?
---
Sad to hear you are leaving the game. Hope you will consider returning one day.
---
2nd post on this in 24hrs

There's really no harm at all in just jumping into it, giving it a shot, and seeing where things go. Preparation isn't always necessary, or the best route.
---
This right here. Don't try new things. Don't see what might be fun. Don't gain new experiences. Be plain, be boring, be miserable.

That's not what this is about. You don't do it in 1 second
---
&gt;so you ran away from tribute 
---
Deployed before you deployed
---
&gt; go pick on a few hundred man alliance with your 6,000 man strong coalition...damn you scary.
---
Only NC. is deployed, NC. deployed because two alliance sized Goon sigs and Test formed for evey major objective

It seems you need urgent assistance from WYES ltd.

---
There’s a disadvantage to both. Shield increases sig radius if otherwise cap stable, effectively multiplying the tracking of XL incoming volleys by 1.2 or worse. Armor tank affects positioning on grid and when needing to outpace the other super capitals for burst projector purposes. Multiplied by TiDi.
---
I had never even heard of this game. Thank you, going to check it out
---
You seem to have had a good time in eve. Nice to end on a high! :)
---
Name changes on the cash store.
---
That's more to do with supers being OP and there not being any viable strategies for asymmetric warfare, what with unlimited instant reinforcements available at the push of a button.
---
I'm willing to bet if supers were nerfed (say, by reducing their EHP massively to the point where they all but require FAX support to survive an engagement, thus limiting their deployment to large prepared fights and forcing more players out of supers and into FAXes) and cynos were easier to counter (say, by making mobile inhibs anchor instantly), Goons' OP-ness would be a lot easier to counter.
---
Yeah, my point exactly. Everyone who expects landlords to protect their renters from blops just has no idea whatsoever how the game works.
---
I think it is fair to say Goons are busy elsewhere at the moment.
---
Wat, surely it's not because fuck unspoken.
---
I have no pride and no ~~gil~~ ISK.

Goons are currently winning a war

---
A question about the details how you create this list. You obviously go through killsmails with super capitals involved. Do you simply add a +1 to the alliance the pilot was in when the killmail happened or do you create a list of those pilots and then check in the end the current alliance?
---
been years since he was a actual good fc

TFW you win so hard you have to retreat back home because your krabbing income is getting fucked hard by the enemy you're winning against.

In the era of injectors this is essentially useless AF. Thanks.
---
No, rule of 6 is not a thing anymore
---
Yes and no. IME, the Rule of 6 applies easily 99% of the time. I've only had 2-3 cases in the last few months where the Rule of 6 has betrayed me, and that's out of maybe a thousand or so hacks.
---
PL had 100 titans during their southern move op. But have lost ISRAD, waffles, peak and RTSQ in terms of actives. Their pickups have been less Titan heavy.
---
CCP banned gaara already for input broadcasting 50 cynos at once, so I cannot fight his living of RMT profits anymore that he did already when still input broadcasting 50 Sentry Chimeras in Deklein long before WWB ....
---
They don’t prevent you from refitting with a depot, do they? Or do they stop you from warping even if they’re just in cargo?
---
When did that change? Is it just for certain sites or structures as well?
---
Came from the right person
---
Congratz on winning EVE, fly safe!
---
"Any relevant pl member"
---
If you go out, go out in style
---
I appreciate your thinking sir and good luck
---
However unsafe the north is right now, it would be pretty hard for it to be less safe than delve. 
---
I suppose joining test would work, they aren’t involved in the war at all yet and the eastern war is a stalemate, so it’s still as safe as ever in Eso.
---
the goons are deployed to kill a few botters so home ground is not protect as it normally is
---
Nice.
---
Glad to have flown with you Xadi. Good luck on your future endeavors.
---
WinterCo Also been krabbing up a storm while they where left alone and have boomed in the number of titans / soups which haven't seen combat yet.
---
And surely you wouldn't need to form your entire coalition to evict shitty dronelands residents? (but you did).
---
Show some dignity and fuck 5 bill
---
2 stabs shouldn’t really hurt your dps if you shield tank, but i guess you’re dealing with dual faction scrams by now which means all 6 lows are stabs.
---
Soul Reaver was a good game ;)
---
True. Yet it makes you wonder about the scale of Botting/RMT when goons get like 2% on the CCP chart ... while NC gets 16%.        
---
Sure there are XXdeath and FRT with bigger numbers, but still NC have a lot of stuff to fix, and CCP big part of FRT and XX to kill.
---
Yes it is.
---
Didn't you see the CCP data about people banned for Botting/RMT?
---
Now wouldn't that be an interesting twist
---
Why are you quiting?
---
Fly save o/
---
Hope, RNGesus loves me :)
---
Okay like i said. I just came back. Who are they at war with now?
---
Wait did Gobbins left PL?    
---
(sorry but my corp kind of left PL and i lost a lot of interest in PL actions)
---
Why not refit them to combat? If he’s gimping his ships for max points you can probably kill a few and then moonwalk out with the overprop AB.
---
Goons deployed north, people who don't read pings are dying.
---
So you're just repeating what the OP said and then plugging your own shitty site?
---
Wow this is a cool spreadsheet :)

more like kicked out

Just commenting for the raffle. Dual Universe, im always reaaaaly skeptical of new games claiming awesome stuff, atleast now i know it exists :D Something to keep my eye on now. Gz on winning EVE

wargod wasn't really a tactical genius, just a really good skirmish fc during a time when that was about all you needed to deep dick a sov holding coalition
---
although could argue that it was genius of him to realize what he was capable of
---
 "NC. deployed because two alliance sized Goon sigs "  
---
150 people is alliance sized these days?
---
Yes, and greater western co sphere were there, surprising considering their young age. I'm guessing you're going to say they are not goons
---
Drf were well represented, they are dead
---
B0t was owned by many entities and even if you like to pin them to panfam you really can't before they release year by year stats
---
Lmao
---
Don't care to learn about a bunch of nerd miners/ratters that actively shun content for years by throwing 800 titans at it whenever it tries to appear.
---
The table does not show the Titans which haven't been used yet :), i bet the Imperium has more than 900 combined...
---
man nobody remembers c4 and that's sad
---
"Lost interest in PL actions"
---
Yeah, thats why you post about them every time a member leaves or a pod gets killed. Pretty sure you care more about PL than PL themself
---
I'm pretty sure you know the answer to that question, and i'm pretty sure you know what roles Gobbins had in PL
---
Gotta suck not being the biggest fish in the pond anymore

Fly safe out there.

with such badposting you belong on goon forums

Hard to say if that's just Tapi paranoia or not. I would say test is more under representated here because FRT use theirs a lot more in China tz.

Go to a alliance on zkill, press supers, see supers

Sad to see you go. I too have been winning EVE lately - at least temporarily. It's been a blast.

Maybe we will see each other on the battlefield again some day!

I've been using anoikis for years. Plz explain why its rubbish. Or are you just talking shit ?

Oh wait in before "baited got u noob"

I wanted to but I don't have combat refits available and I don't have the capacity to do on-demand supply runs.

Expect yourself to be always susceptible to others. You will never be 100% safe in this game, so do not undock something you do not want to loose. Fly cheap, use ships for what is needed.
---
In high security space (systems with &gt;= 0.5 security status), CONCORD (NPC police) will shoot and kill anyone shooting you without reason. Beware that if you are suspect or wardecked, people can shoot you without CONCORD interference. Also, CONCORD will catch and kill anyone attacking you in HS without reason, it doesn't mean you won't die. It's called suicide ganking and plenty of people are doing it, so don't carry super valuable stuff in ships that cannot hold against suicide gankers.
---
Outside of HS, people will basically kill you if they can. Hence why most people team up to protect each others in corporations and alliances.
---
havent done a supply run and no reason to if the camping and such goes up orders of magnitude over the next few days.
---
It was kinda mandatory, given.,,
---
to be fair even the fairly competent wormholers that stop by often cant hold my ishtars

so what numbers to follow to get the hack done?

If you give me the 5b I will double it for you, so you can give away 10b!

Almost... XD

Good luck to your next adventures in RL.

that's why i'm over here reading goon comments saying shit like "that only matters if you care about killboards"

From a fellow EZCO line member who was at the fight it's a shame to see you leave; it was probably one of the more ballsiest things I've seen someone do in this game and I'm glad that at least one lived. Best fight I've ever had in a carrier.

Yes, which shows who controls what space, its not relevant for this use

Bot has a lot of members, but isnt going to form to defend tribute, definitely not in titans

I love the T4R. Excellent vehicle for families. That rear windows, zoinks!
---
nor is MC. what's your point?
---
Ah now i understand, they take their umbrella away so their bots at home die, 11/10
---
search some NPSIs and go fly with them.
---
I've heard people advise against using it, as it just wastes time that could be better spent hacking and looting.
---
These are the kind of people who use Zeugs and Backglasses, so every hack could be accomplished by letting their cats run across the keyboard, so yeah I can see why in their situation it would be a waste of time.
---
I hope you enjoyed your run of EVE!
---
That the ship pr 1k member is useless unless he removes a lot of those alliances
---
I'd come back to the game if I got the 5b, lol.
---
If you're talking PvP you can just undock what ever ship you want, go to LS and get some fights.
---
I have a lot of experience in this field as a member of Noir., Mercenary Coalition and even briefly In 2010 with The 0rphanage. The last being relevant because of how warfare in highsec normally works.
---
Merc work in eve is by and large is a reputation based lifestyle. If you are a novice with no yo few kills and no experience running a Merc outfit or even being a mercenary you are unlikely going to be able to understand what you should be doing fully nor will anyone have any reason to believe you're not just another wardec scammer or jita camper.
---
Firstly join a Corp that already operates by doing what you want to do and learn all you can from them then think about what they do that you don't like. When you believe you have enough experience in this then you can create a corporation and decide what kind of mercenary you want to be.
---
We've all since left the mercenary game because eve no longer desires our kind of mercenary, I hope you have more luck In modern eve.
---
Good luck.
---
o7 best of luck, ingame nick for the raffle: Ddolik
---
&gt;did you really wrote
---
See you in a year
---
It really depends on what you want to do.  Most PVE content is single-player-able.  Trying to find PVP content solo is going to be more time consuming than you're likely going to be able to commit, though.  Though I believe Red vs Blue is still I think, so there's that kind of "recreational" pvp, though I can't speak to the quality of experience with them one way or the other.
---
God give me everything I want.
---
Yea, frig/dessie 1v1s and roaming in a cruiser are both fun lowsec activities. You could be a wormhole camper, or roam nullsec in a Kiki / AF.
---
Bye
---
A lot of people say it got patched out yonks ago, others say it’s still there but not to consider it a 100% rule.
---
Nice work )
---
I'm amused that hk renters are on the list, but hk isn't :thinking:
---
You like to pretend you're retarded don't you?
---
Again
---
B0t have been owned by many enteties over the years, b0t is fucking old
---
Goons got 2% from a brand new alliance
---
Botting isnt goos for renting alliances, they loose isk on it, stop sperging a retarded narrative
---
If its pvp you're after, go with faction warfare.
---
Pve, look into running abyssal deadspace.
---
Ok, but more importantly, are they nerfing the Kiki’s PG like someone said in another thread?
---
you will come back again, no one have ever won eve
---
I'm only here for the 5b
---
Send your eve winning to me and I'll double it!
---
i don't get this thing, wall of shame for a loki tengue loss? occurator? so what any kill mails are going to be put on this?
---
I am not of the ones screeching that Goons are the worst, I know of PanFams large shares in inaugurating the renter pest to EVE. Yet I still doubt the reliability of this data. I saw them bot in Deklein, I see them bot in Delve .... and if its not a full PvE Bot, than its NEAR2 for the afk-VNIs or TACO for the afk Rorquals with ISB broadcast for Excavators ...
---
Yes 2% for goons 16% for NC
---
Sent contact request. I am vaguely familiar with goon's activities, mainly learning about the Fountain War in passing. I haven't had any experience good or bad with them so I am not quick to judge.
---
My Blood Demons Alliance from DeadCo have 25 supers, im so surprised
---
No, 2% for goons 16% for a alliance owned by many different enteties over the years
---
2% from a new alliance
---
16% from a old alliance
---
Without year by year stats these are useless
---
100% of those 16 could be before nc. Owned b0t, or it could be after
---
What you are missing is the fact that as a member of a corp or alliance you save yourself ALOT of work, which you sound like you don't have time for.  
---
The days of high participation requirements of Eve corps are long gone; we're all 30+ years old now and trying to have lives outside of work and spaceships.  
---
Don't try to play Eve as a singleplayer game, just don't
---
This greater western is not a new alliance, goons used it to rent out like half of eve before.           
---
There is no "narrative" here, but just pure data offered by CCP.
---
Unspoken: Everyone Help! Panfam are bullying us!
---
Panfam: lol weak plebs, get out of nullsec.
---
2 Weeks Later...
---
Panfam: Everyone Help! Goons are bullying us!
---
Goons: lol weak plebs, get out of nullsec.
---
Vexor is really nice for the easy ones
---
Piggybacking off this.
---
Step 1:  
---
Pick a timezone. If you pick multiple timezones you need multiple people manning those timezones. If you are the only person leading, you need to play pretty much every day.
---
Step 2:
---
Develop defensive strategies. Probably your goal will be to defend structures. Figure out how to make that happen. It will probably cost a lot of money. You will probably be tempted into battleships but without proper experience you'll find yourself probed &amp; annihilated a lot. The cheapest and simplest strategy for defensive purposes are ECM Griffins. But that's boring as fuck. Maybe you get lucky and the attackers are all flying battlecruisers in which case you can probably act as the equalizing force in the war.
---
Step 3:
---
Recruit like-minded players that are interested in implementing your strategy. Make sure they have something to do when there are no wars.
---
Step 4:
---
Train &amp; promote potential leadership candidates, so that you can at least take Tuesdays off from EVE.
---
Step 5:
---
Build a network of connections and think about intelligence and espionage. Most war targets will dock up when they see you in local. Stalk, then scan them down with a neutral cloaky alt, wait until they are vulnerable (e.g. in warp to a mission) and then spring the trap. Don't forget that they have intelligence too, so maybe sitting on the in-gate and being logged in are probably not the best of ideas.
---
Step 6:
---
Fund at least 1 of my accounts and I'll help you with steps 2 through 4.
---
Trust in the rust skin coming doesn't have a rag skin?
---
Yeah, fuck us !
---
O7
---
I am sure that people are rmt/botting in all groups.       
---
I am also sure that CCP is banning them when they find them.      
---
It is more about the fact how the "people who got caught" are showing up in CCP data.     
---
Based on 2 first assumptions you can translate this to real active botters/RMTers in specific groups.         
---
Unless you assume that for some strange reason CCP is not banning Rmters/botters in Goons for some reason.
---
I'm amazed Jita doesn't have a big anchored cock 24/7
---
I expect that was a joke/shaming.  The Occator loss is legit given the ISK loss.
---
Damn dude, shame to see you go, but congrats on winning nonetheless. Glad you got to go out with a massive bang!
---
Would be better if you just stuck a ship somewhere among blues and the dude who can keep it scrammed for longest would get it? Let's just do that in delve, save you some trouble.
---
Gf, came into the fight a little late but was some really fun chaos. Sad to see another player go, but thank you for going out in style!
---
It's a bit sad to see players leave. But I do hope you have a good life! Fly safe out there! o7
---
The op itself didn't that all that long.  It was about 4 hours of heavy TIDI.  There are multiple ops over several days in all TZ to get everyone up there though.  That's why it's taking so long.
---
No grammar police.
---
you're missing the mark of my joke, yeah
---
One of my best earliest memory from Eve is when I fitted myself an exploration Tengu and lived in it for a few months in deep nullsec. (In my altcorp, without any infrastructure.)
---
Did relic/data sites, trained skills, injected eventually a few skillbooks which I brought with me (back then when we needed all required skills trained to inject skill), and just generally enjoyed the atmosphere.
---
Thanks for your activity chart.
---
in game mail sent ;)
---
F wh down
---
I do not do much hacking, but for me it still held lately. 
---
If i find a defense on a centre node with 6 connections, the end is in one of those.
---
RIP Eve, can I have your stuff?
---
Spodbless with your future endeavours o/
---
Ironically this event was one of reasons (but mostly it's because of burnout ofc) why I suspended my accounts for unknown amount of time, if not left the game for good.
---
I was on vacation in beginning of may, so when I returned home and found out about the event, it was already too late for me to even try to get those juicy 1.1m sp.
---
Also, I mean, daily rewards is evil, try to change my mind. But 16 days long daily rewards with huge payout at the end is pure evil, like Hitler-grade level of evil, and don't try to change my mind on that. What I am to you CCP, a fucking hamster without personal life and with sole purpose to be a number in your metrics on daily basis? And if for some reason I'm unable to do so then I should be denied from low-hanging jucy fruits? Is that should be my motivation? Fuck that shit.

I use a Astero for high and lowsec DED running. It can pretty easily run up to 4/10 sites with no bling and if you bling it out a little 5/10 are no problem.

Also carry a mobile depot for in space refitting. Optionally you can carry a scram/point and web refit as well. Refit more DDA for easier sites and more ENAMs for harder sites (Angels is harder because of the low explosive resistance, carrying an explosive nano membrane for them isn't a bad idea and Guristas are harder because more of the damage lands on you even going fast with low sig.) You could also optionally fit rat type specific hardeners but i was flying around so much and found it a huge hassle. 
---
The only site i've found that was actually impossible (even fully blinged with faction DDAs and augmented drones) was the Angel 4/10. The Overseer battlecruiser simply reps so hard that you can't outsps it. This is a very leisurely ship. It doesn't clear the sites with great time efficiency. I also had no problem with any sleeper caches with this ship (aside from the hidden room and the mine room in the superior sleeper cache.) If you plan on doing tons of explo (scanning relic/data sigs and running them) carrying a MWD refit isn't a bad idea.

---
Ok so lets clear this up.       
---
[Data in question](https://twitter.com/CCP_Peligro/status/1126496159407792128/photo/1)          
---
Point 1:          
---
The data show us top 25 offenders in terms of perma bans.      
---
Most of the time you get perma ban for RMT and botting.        
---
^(if you don't agree with this please let me know)       
---
Point 2        
---
This is a historical data till 08/05/2019 - so basically since the beginning of data gathering till moment of posting.             
---
We are talking about **years of data** , you can see it by seeing there a lot of long dead groups.                     
---
^(tell me if you don't agree with this).           
---
 
---
Point 3                   
---
Data show us that :       
---
* NCPL related bans are related to groups like :       
---
Northern Associates. 6%      
---
Brothers of Tangra  10%      
---
* Goons related bans are linked to groups like :          
---
Greater Western Co-Prosperity Sphere 2%            
---
^(again tell me if you don't agree with this point).              
---
Point 4.      
---
Renter groups by forming date :        
---
* http://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Brothers_of_Tangra

---
^(again if you don't agree with this tell me)              
---
Based on the points above you can say that based on CCP data 16% people banned for RMT/Botting are related to NCPL, while at the same time 2% were connected to Goons.               
---
Sure there are bigger offenders, yet when comparing NCPL and goons you can see who are "the baddies"         
---
Waiting for your response.
---
More salt plz
---
Meh you will come back sooner or later.
---
You dont have max tidi for only 100 titan.
---
May clear skies be in your future.
---
Congratz on winning eve! Enjoy!
---
Sad to see you leave! Sounds like you had an awesome to with eve! What an amazing game
---
Panfam is dead, we cannot downvote anything anymore.
---
What is even the point of joining tnt,bastion or lawn over goons, or test over goons for thay matter
---
Fly safe in real life o7
---
Having quite a high IQ, I understood this logic on first read through.
---
I think you can refit in site afaik
---
"We are aware that there will still be ways for warp core stabs to be used in FW even after these changes (including using them at the unrestricted large complexes and refitting with a depot inside the complex)"

TBH I'm just amazed that your found Razor
---
Thats a lot of botting.
---
Loki with a covops sub,uses heavy missiles, 100mn ab and shoots 600dps for 60km range. No need to refit.
---
I guess you forgot the whole part about b0t not being owned by panfam in all their lifespan, these numbers mean nothing without yeat by year statistics
---
Also i never said grr goons panfam are good. Its you that tries to play this of like panfam supports botters while goons are against it, while the fact is that everyone is against it.
---
Of course renter alliances have more botters than other alliances, and we all know what alliances have playstyles that favor having renter empires.
---
Botters are bad for renting alliances, i know you know fuck all about this so i'm jusy going to point you towards TiS and one of their latest episodes, though is is biased.
---
Again, its you thats sperging a retarded narrative about a good and a bad side here while the fact is that everyone is the good guys and the botters are the bad guys.
---
So I'd take 3.7B people to paint it in a day,  could be done.  :-)
---
Look at super loses, they die fast to 5-6 dreads or even fleet of bombers.
---
F for your free stuff. 
---
Also been a pleasure and had fun. May life treat you well and the sun not burn yo I.
---
Oh no, don't get me wrong i still like to laugh from what they have become.       
---
No doubt here.
---
Im here for the freestyle 5b
---
Goons don’t need r/eve to wipe the north so we are left with everyone sitting on their hands while they do. 
---
It will pass.
---
I wish there were 10 people
---
Congratulations on winning EVE, I guess!
---
I've tried EVE multiple times in the past, never hooked me for longer than a couple months. Always got lost by the amount of sand in the box.
---
Subscribed again a 66 days ago, but this time it's a bit different. Found a small streamer with a very deep knowledge of the game and who has been crucial to my growth. He's been willing to teach in his streams, explaining fits and game mechanics in dept. His killboard is  also pretty impressive, making lots of content during is stream sessions.
---
So now, i'm still in hisec, hoarding as much ISK as mining in hisec allows and increasing my SPs. Actually counting the days that I will be strong enough to move to null and fly (and explode) alongside him :)
---
ISKs would be very welcome! So please, RNGesus, glaze upon me!
---
As the chart says its only Active supers/titans.
---
the numbers for other coalitions are probably higher as well.
---
Don't biomass. On the off-chance that this game survives for another few decades, and you find yourself an old fart with more time than you have any use for. Fly safe.
---
Is industry viable for solo players?
---
I am thinking about starting to research and copy blueprints but looking at the contracts in Jita, it does not look profitable...
---
How do people make money with industry? And do they?
---
well, 100 titans plus a similar number of supers, fax, carriers and dreads, total was a bit north of two full fleets
---
we didn't hit *max* tidi, but we didn't hit zero tidi either
---
Fly safe 07
---
holy hell that made me laugh
---
Congrats on winning EVE. I'll give out goodies when I eventually (hopefully) win as well.
---
We'll miss your excel sheets and posts, hopefully we'll see you still here at the reddit :)
---
there is but it's more time consuming since you have to do everything yourself. i play alone too, run lvl 4 missions for isk and solo pvp in nullsec in faction frigates mostly. isk is pretty easy to make by yourself if you have enough sp. solo pvp in null can be a pain cause most people just ram you in assault frigs and blob but you can always go to lowsec for cheap and quick fights if that's ur thing
---
yeah that's what I'm saying
---
if you post it far enough in advance, make it on a weekend, and tell people there won't be a second chance to move, they'll show up and you'll get moved
---
if you make it clear that there will be late moves and all time zones and etc etc etc that's when shit starts going slowly
---
just go by the individual alliance numbers and be smug
---
Poor little goonie.
---
Sad that you so sad.
---
Go out with a bang they say!
---
He is playing the game
---
Leaving in a blaze of glory. Nice
---
i play EVE with 1 acc ,from time to time, for the last &gt;5 years. 2-3 hours a day at best . mind some aspects of the gameplay  :
---
* everything is harder - logistics \\ pve \\ very hard pvp.
---
* you have no friends so any autistic guy with 2+ accounts playing for 10 hours every day is a threat except if it's a bot or carebear in nutshell. And carebears tend to defend their space in hordes.   pm me if you want some advices
---
Good luck buddy!
---
&gt; Also date founded isnt the same as years of renting, Greater Western is new.
---
Yes but it includes also old data, like you see NA is here and stuff long dead.      
---
So time when GW had a lot of space is here.         
---
Next thing is that it is just GW here, like you don't see goons (like you don't see NCPL directly) but then we are talking about share size of those groups ...           
---
What i am saying ( and i will be saying ) **NCPL need to fix their shit up**.          
---
Sorry but 16% is a lot, especially when someone was constantly saying ** that they are against RMT/Botting, so something is done by goons**     
---
Don't get me wrong but just look at this data.        
---
XXdeath rentals -&gt; dead         
---
Solar rentals -&gt; dead          
---
Legacy rentals -&gt; alive       
---
Goons rentals -&gt; alive      
---
NCPL rentals -&gt; alive       
---
Fraternity -&gt; alive              
---
drone rentals -&gt; alive           
---
The biggest ^(in terms of harm done to the game) alive player that is left is NCPL ...
---
I think that's how one is winning Eve!
---
It's rubbish because its not the one he's known for years.
---
Yes, especially now, with abyssals
---
Also i know ccp is working on more fleetfinder features for the agency specifically at getting people into public fleets
---
You could always try dital as a base of operations  with a bi weekly public moon and connections to hisec and providence
---
Spectre fleet also stages from there i think
---
What's the third rig on this fit?
---
You never truly quit eve. When you someday come back, shoot me a PM and I'll get you set back up, you seem like you truly deserve it
---
I didn't say old data didn't count, point was the greater western have much less years rented and therefore their numbers are high per year
---
Again, you don't know that without year by year numbers, i'll be happy to agree with you when peligro releases those stats and they show that what you're thinking is correct. For now its just speculation
---
To be fair quite a few people were there for the main move op (thousands).  But on the theory that no player's behind should be left, there are many such ops.   
---
Also remember that people like to bring all their toys even if they can't fly them simultaneously, so they go back and bring up the next capital, etc.  I did two ops personally.  First one Titan, Super, Fax, Dread and the second one I brought a Carrier.  So I can pretty much respond to any mainfleet ping I like because I've got all based covered.
---
Everytime I see someone quitting EVE is a sad moment for me. Fly safe forever mate o7.
---
Fact check...
---
Did we listen to the same show?! 
---
Repeated "farming" of weaker/defenceless alliances by powerful entities is frowned upon. That cannot be health of the game...
---
At no point did anyone say that going solo into nullsec is considered "farming"...
---
That was IRL
---
They're at war with a patch of empty space in Tribute. 
---
The emptiness of this space explains why goons have no kills. 
---
The emptiness of their strategy explains why they forgot to leave anyone at home to protect the krabs.
---
A couple of my personal favorites would be MukkBarovian and Wolfsdragoon.
---
So when Goons docked up in Saranen because of being outnumbered 2:1 and went to reddit spinning it is okay, but when PanFam docks up because being outnumberd 3,5:1 and spins on reddit it is the end of civilised world? What drugs are you taking?
---
I cannot remember having read such an organised withdrawal from a game. Typical EvE. :)
---
Everyone comes back, no one ‘wins’ eve.
---
But that’s on trying to go out in this way!
---
I just realised if we flip Meep it is weeb.
---
Eh this is a 16 years of data - he tweeted this day later.     
---
https://twitter.com/CCP_Peligro/status/1126498287396192258      
---
So for 16 years Goons (biggest alliance in game) didn't managed to get to the list of top offenders.            
---
The only impact you see on the list is GW ... 2%.             
---
At the same time NCPL managed to get 16% on the renter groups ( much less that the goons alone).          
---
FRT in short time managed to get 5% ... rest of big players are dead.
---
Sounds like you had a fun last bit of time! Hope to see you again some day when you come back to visit :)
---
Goons havent had that big rental empires for a fraction of the time panfam has, keep screaming about those numbers, they still lack year by year to actually show something
---
Dunk made sure to include "nano-bullshit" for "killboard padding" without mentioning gang-size.
---
EVE isn't fun
---
No third rig, T1 grav cap +T2 nano pump are 350 calibration. T2 launcher+sisters probes+T1 grav is 104 scan strength, just enough to get superior sleeper caches.
---
Report to CCP
---
Didn't Goons put up a fight before retreating to Saranen?
---
That's because Goons were employing brilliant 4D Fabian Strategy while Panfam are just blindly fleeing with no thought.
---
BjornBee streams solo PVP most days, has a lot of fun doing it :) (does fleets too). Good for inspiration and ideas! twitch.tv/BjornBee
---
*star cluster
---
False, each time I build stuff I  +-1.6x the isk I put into it.
---
hahaha nice way to go out.
---
That’s an impressive list of achievements for just a couple of years! Good luck irl!
---
Jesus...... i agree with this.         
---
But if you get Bot numbers + NA numbers + PL numbers + NC numbers ... those will still not get to like 50% of goons numbers.               
---
Goons keeps all chars in the main alliance , NCPL for very long time kept PVE chars in controlled renter groups (and in many cases they are still there).                 
---
Sorry but you will not persuade me that NCPL have nothing to feel **guilty about**
---
If Fozzy Claws were a doctrine you could fight with one could say they tried ... but ...
---
J5A Fountain  &lt;-&gt; F-N (Querious) is like 5-6 minutes in a shuttle, faster in a ceptor.
---
cording CCP Goons don't bot compare the north that much ;)
---
Nope.
---
Garst Tyrell for the Iron Throne imo. He gets a bit angry every now and then but who cares, he brings you to fights to win them.
---
BuT wHeRe Is ThE pRoOf
---
It's not just legacy that's underrepresented. Ours is off by more than a factor of 15. zkill is probably the most imprecise way to measure as it only catches ones that show up on kill mails. Not ones that are docked because they're not at war, not ones that aren't getting blown up because people are careful and so on and so forth. Fairly useless reporting tool for this.
---
Bye! Gl w the irl...
---
Maybe not quite of the criteria set out in the OP yet I would place Kendarr very high on that list.
---
Tactically he is very very good, his situational awareness is really quite uncanny, his motivation was absolutely spot-on.
---
His real strength though (imho) was in how he engaged with and managed "people" and could inspire them to better themselves always and regardless of the outcome of the last scrap, his enthusiasm was very contagious. He is certainly a charismatic and very likable guy, which of course helps in any field and particularly in EvE. 
---
An exceptional FC has to have a natural leadership skill set else he is only as good as the F1 on anchor. Kendarr has it in buckets and it was a great pleasure of mine to fly with him.
---
Well they are looking for any reason they can not to actually fight goons, what do you expect.
---
In CCP data. 5% perma bans for Botting/RMT in the short life spawn of the FRT&amp;Treasury.        
---
For comparison NCPL managed to get 16% on the same statistics in 6 years ... and goons 2% in the same 6 year period.
---
Looking forward to seeing you come back in some time :)
---
I've done a Lot of Bomber Ratting.
---
You can try the recon crusier from Amarr.
---
So what are you going to use the time gained to pursue?
---
"It's ok guys, they may have killed a majority of our fleets and made us run but we totally did not whelp the *entire* fleet!"
---
Couple of months ago it said "Fix the UI" One I could get behind.
---
Just wanted to wish you the best of luck, mate. Cheers and fly safe.
---
That was the first time I used caps in a WH before, fun times.  
---
You have been great Andrew, hope you have loads of fun with DU!  
---
Also to everyone, join EZCO, great corp with great people and loads of fun.
---
Your will to "bet" is based upon assumption that currently supers do not require fax support, which, needless to say is completely wrong as well as expectations of super pilots switching to fax instead of staying in said supers. Main question you should ask is not whether any and all players already own a fax do have an alt or not, but rather how many.
---
&gt; exploring every single J-space system 
---
wtf is that? jump-in -&gt; v-scan -&gt; jump out -&gt;profit?
---
Ask someone who actually knows anything about the game what 'salt' is, then come back and talk to me.
---
The real question is: Why do you have portraits activated on your local chat? Oo
---
That's just you Hila, he just doesn't know you're a renter with a [97% inactive alliance](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99008278/). Give him some credit, he actually upgraded you with that email. You got to pretend you had a seat at the table for a few minutes while you posted this.

r/eve is still better than actual eve
---
ro6 still makes it faster to explore the hacking area and find the actual solution. You can predict the end spot most of the times, and using ro6 to get to the other side without encountering any obstacles makes it faster.
---
Makes you wonder where all that bot rental isk goes
---
That is the strong stuff. +1
---
And you are leaving right before the war... that's sad :(
---
Show me on this doll where I touched your feelings.
---
Yeah I recall the "nano-bullshit" for "killboard padding" comments - in the context of the discussion though I felt it was pretty clear that references were made about larger groups in "nano-bullshit".
---
Not a solo pilot or a 2-10 man nano gang.
---
I mean lets be honest solo or 2-10 man gang cannot realistically live up to the definition of "farming" - that's just hit &amp; run tactics which will demoralise a medium sized group any time soon.
---
As far as RonUSMC on older episodes, can't comment.
---
Ok Giuliani
---
Enjoy winning Eve! i just finished winning eve myself. See you when you resub :P
---
Oh my, you really believe nobody knows why a full goon deployment is a bad thing given the public information on what you plan on bringing? Don't tell me you actually believe every little thing goon leadership says..
---
who needs a home when you are down in delve torpedoing krabs and bombing bads?
---
It's a fit that lets you keep ratting even with the entirety of the Imperium heading north. I'd say it's doing a fantastic job.
---
33 thousand, not million. So quite a bit less than Canada. It's about the population of my home town.
---
Instructions still unclear, cucumber stuck in dick.
---
I take my chances. Fly safe IRL.
---
I mean, it looks like the goon fleets got hazed and had to run away with all those losses..
---
I have yet to see nano gangs with more than 2-10 people.
---
Are C13's popular with day trippers? Explorers? Are they worth hunting in?
---
NC has defended BoT space at the expense of real content for its members on numerous occasions. PL as well - although it was easier before fozzie sov to be sure.
---
"owned by" , "rented by" is easily obfuscated. "Defended by" is pretty clear
---
gigX had about the tactical finesse of a caveman tho
---
Don't forget to add the russian supercap fleet on the Legacy side
---
I was thinking the same thing about the Erebus.  
---
The hull is too ugly not to have more decent looking skins!
---
That's about the top end of what NC gets on a great day.
---
Risk aversion is the meta of mega alliances. If it wasn’t NC. wouldn’t be unachoring their keepstars to save the killmails. Sure at times it sucks but I would say it’s fair to say that the ratio of people that wouldn’t do the things you mentioned is similar across Eve not just our alliance. We just look more like it due to our size. 
---
That being said due to OPs question KarmaFleet is superior to all other new player groups.
---
This is super ignorant to name Unspoken Alliance pets of Goons.  
---
They fought way before any Imperium SIG got involved and they didn't call for any help. We just came and fought alongside them because it seemed fun and stuff. I know it's part of the meta-war, but I'd like to point out that Unspoken did this stuff on their own - and they sadly pay the price on their own. So they also deserve the honor on their own. :)
---
Nothing for Horde Vanguard (TRYHD)?
---
You kidding me? Anoikis is great.
---
Couple of shattered holes have sansha rats instead of sleepers iirc
---
I was visiting that wh yesterday, i almost rolled you out. It's always sad when people go to greener pastures. Always appreciated fights with you and the puns about get off my lawn.
---
Take care and good luck in your new ventures.
---
Thonk about it
---
best of luck in future games.
---
is that all you got, renter? lol You can't afford me. lol hey, I'm all for you pretending you're relevant. I just post facts. Try to spin them all you want. I should post some of the WinterCo eve mails about you sometime lol
---
Who is Ibis and why should he FapInPeace?
---
Oh I agree, but I've also been guilty of focusing so much on the ro6 and clicking everything I can rather than paying attention and getting the 'quickest' route to the core.
---
You know, TEST deployed alone against GotG.  We didn't bring supers.  PLNC brought supers to defend them on every major timer.
---
In High-Sec space you will be relatively safe 98% of the time.
---
Avoid carrying valuable items in your cargo - by valuable I mean few hundred million isk - unless as already advised you are in a ship that can evade a suicide ganker that is willing to lose their ship in order to kill yours in the hope that your cargo will drop as loot and make enough profit for them to pay for the loss.
---
Concord are quick to respond in 1.0 sec systems - lower down the sec status they take a bit longer to respond.
---
I would not worry about getting ganked though - it's not something that happens often and when it does you learn from it - and what to avoid next time.
---
Amusing that B.B.C is listed as being independent, their goon masters say jump and they ask how high.
---
Thank you &lt;3
---
Not really
---
I can hear from your tone that you are far away from done with eve, no matter how hard you are trying right now. All I can suggest is keep some isk and keep your main(s) training. If not, you will regret it later.
---
i give you two years.
---
Sounds pretty dirty, i am all for!
---
Sad to have an experienced player go. Good luck with future endeavors! O7
---
I remember the other guy few months ago who also killed his titan befor leaving, he was from Lawn too
---
Piloting a Titan. My alt has Erebus mastery lvl 4. Now I just need the titan.
---
You forgot the  v-scan after jump out.
---
That wasn't his point. To call TNT, Bastion and Lawn Goons pets kinda makes sense from a certain point of view, but an alliance that just finds itself on the same side of a war isn't automatically a pet. They have no diplomatic ties with the Imperium at all, so it's just stupid propaganda to call them pets.  
---
But well, what do I expect from Panfam...
---
Oijanen fights were defending TEST structures, and frat would absolutely show up when goons didn't.
---
That's fine and all.  I'm just saying that your relationship with Fraternity is extremely similar to our relationship with goons.
---
mad bois mad bois, whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do when you think the memes are true
---
I would try to write an answer but your english is too hard to decypher
---
Easiest money is still getting a titan bpo and selling copies, takes a while to research first tough. But with the amount of titans being stomped out of the ground, proper copies sell like crazy
---
That is some really shitty writing right there.
---
Run incursions until you can't feel your face from the mind numbing experience. Sell the LP, combine with ISK and use to go shoot stuff in LS. 
---
Recommend setting up own Corp for running incursions to minimise corp tax.
---
Yes. Single player experience have improved in my opinion, I used to play years ago and just recently got back. Bombers bar (public whaling - cap hunting) is the first thing that spring to mind, corps can't 're wardecced or wardec unless they own a structure, easy jumpclone access and a much higher plex price means that credit card warrioring during weekends is alot cheaper. Skill injectors is also a new thing. The alpha account system means you don't even need to sub to play.
---
Burn a ceptor 50km behind the gate, warp to him at 50.
---
Personally I find it makes people more quickly identifiable, atleast if I've already seen them and checked out who they are.
---
It's like recognising someone by their face instead of reading name tags.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/br5ptv/all_good_things_must_come_to_an_end
---
It just got that decent looking greenish neon one
---
Good advice. Thanks I'll look into it.
---
You can earn decent Isk exploring in Null.
---
PvP can be found in Wormholes although it's not exactly a fair fight experience.
---
I have heard there are solo PvP corporations that you join predominantly for advice while playing solo.
---
Now think about era when NA+BOT had like 60% of eve rented out.     
---
Somehow this ISK vanished.
---
Seeing as Snuff is cooperating with NC. to kill shit in delve....
---
Snuff keeps a close relationship to INIT. and is currently blue to them. But not to the imperium as a whole.
---
TIL We are allies with Legacy
---
Sorry, I have to call bullsh\*t on this one. Panfam was nonplussed about LXQ being hostile and made a very concerted effort to get it back. the NC super/titan blobs on previous BR's tell a very different story from the crap you just spewed. Also.... Slyce formed 38... which is more, combined, than they've formed in all ops over the last 4 months. Good for them, that's almost 1% lol
---
Just flew a SV fleet with him. He occasionally comes back for whatever reason. \^\^
---
raist varis of ev0ke multiboxing Bridge-Titan, Grid Prober, Anchor and 2-3 Scouts in 2008 impressed me - if you gave him 80 Drakes + 20 Scimis back then he made miracles happen
---
Lord Maldoror - his calmness in the heat of the fight was unprecedented, also coming up wit some innovations to the Meta
---
Hey, to his defense: The caveman couldn't know any better...
---
i could use five billion
---
o7, i'm hope you had a great time and i hope you are happy with your decision
---
lol, report for racism and move on. If you get lucky he'll get a ban.
---
Well this are to be seen - many people went this way and will finish working on the BPO's soon.      
---
Look what happened to super BPC prices.          
---
You can get aeon (8/12) for 80mil, while nyx/hel (8/12) is 200-250mil.          
---
You can try to sell in jita for much more ... but quite often your contract expires, and you paid a lot to put it up on public contracts.
---
500 skill points and i messed up character creation
---
It's not an estimate really. Saying "There are probably at least 800 goon titans alone!" is an estimate.
---
There is just no way of tracking factual numbers from the outside for all groups equally other than killboards. So we have to go with that when talking facts.      
---
But i'm sure the numbers will go up across the board when things get used.
---
I was thinking of doing that to raise my sec status for a potential Pacifier fit. Everyone says the Pacifier is bad, but I like weird little Covert Ops ships.
---
I can also look for PvP content while ratting. I will have to completely avoid Low Sec PvP though.
---
Ah true, pardon me
---
well in HS it seems there may not be such a difference. But in NS I know there was .
---
So the question is : is it worth it to pay for the SP required ?
---
If you really want to fly single player it is perfectly viable, just gain money trough exploration or do abyssals in highsec, and do pvp roams in low and null. But there are plenty of corps where you can be a casual player no problem, (for example, horde. JOIN HORDE!). Plugs aside, joining a corp will allow you to go on some fun fleets if they happen to be pinged at the time you can play, and in horde you can fc fleets if you wish yourself, as long as no ping is already out. Im sure there are alliances with similar policies, brave i think might be another good one for the casual player. Point is, corps offer more opportunities for fun even for the casual player. But EVE is perfectly viable as a solo game, tough playing MMOs solo sorta defeats the purpose in my view, but you do you.
---
DU seems pretty cool, thanks for the rec
---
Good luck in the future.
---
A winner is you!
---
This can be dangerous in eve, looking at some portraits...
---
&gt; we basicly killed three fleets and a dread in less then 2h fleet.
---
You casually forgot to mention, that those fleets were mostly alphaclones scrambled during/shortly after a biggest move op in EvE history so far. 
---
But if it helps you to cry less at nights, you can keep telling yourself how good you guys are. :D
---
&gt; adly i think at one point you will come back before delve is ashes
---
Nothing is burning except a few krabs who deserve it. And you can bet your ass we will undock and defend our lands, which is a welcome change, if you compare it to the guys we are fighting against.
---
hf in rl
---
Don't know if anyone followed LM to Serenity, but the guys I knew all have quit between 2015 and 2017, Mesh Marillion, Shannia Pain, James Caffeine rtc.
---
Best Investment? Buy a bunch of spaceships and have fun with them shooting at other spaceships.
---
Is it just me or they seem desperate ...
---
Is kinda sad actually, NC/PH don\`t matter ... but PL used to mean something.
---
based
---
Does not even remember using supercapitals anywhere close Etherium reach for this deployment.
---
Fair cosmic winds capsuleer! Wherever your journey may take you.
---
The Mittani protects!
---
We have yet to see an actual asymmetric battle, between titans and dreads for example, since the fax rep nerfs.      
---
Thinking back to the goon dreadbomb (wasn't it 200+?) on killahbees Vanquisher that would probably end differently now than it at the time.       
---
If they had not managed to focus the Vanq than at least a couple of regular titans before losing critical mass.
---
Best of luck with IRL - got to do whats right for yourself.
---
Good thing to see you guys still have your sense of humour. Cause there is not much else left going for you now. ;)
---
Vee called me primary and had me podded the first time I undocked for a fleet as a new goon. :v
---
https://zkillboard.com/kill/25760088/
---
Bastion is living in Fountain for example.
---
TNT, lawn have their own fc, own fleet too.
---
All ally in imperium have their culture, history, leadership, rules, and so on..
---
What you say is as stupid as saying NC / PL / PH are the same.
---
The koolaid is strong in him.
---
Well i'm french, so it's all about rioting and surrendering.
---
200? You wish. We can get 200 rorqs on a moon any day, not even counting subcaps.
---
Not sure which group you belong to, but regardles "factor of 15" is simply ridiculous!
---
That'd make goons have almost 10.000 titans or PL have close to 1.000...
---
Tbh i wouldn't mind feeding my supers in a final brawl
---
I liked the super comparisons you do. Fly safe!
---
U know ... u can filter what brackets/overview are shown.
---
Weren't you derping around in ZXB and 5-C last night?  I'm sure I saw you scoot past whilst I was watching GOT.
---
Is that maybe the current rule?
---
Rule of 6 applies unless the Core is one of the 6 connections?
---
nope, I didn't say all were off by a factor of 15 I said ours were. Read carefully.... Just the black....not the white....
---
The irony that you’re just assuming I’m from the north is fantastic.
---
Surprised me too, it must have been why we had to kick TIKLE out of that pocket, because they are our allies
---
No its not because pl/nc/horde actually have their own fcs
---
They are not deployed together most of the time, for example horde is in delve atm, nc is in drone lands while pl is gatecamping
---
Bastion,tnt,lawn almost never do anything on their own and only join coalition fleeta
---
it is useless to explain anything anymore i just stop trying to. Some of them are so god damn mindblown about what actuall is happening that it dosnt matter. Even when you try to explain things in logic that even a special and or young aged person should understand ...
---
They are lost.
---
"Plenty of FCs still around"
---
Only mentions goons
---
This!
---
keepstars letting people not have dedicated super pilots was a mistake
---
I still don't know who "our" are. Usually that kind of post comes from either goons or panfam side.
---
I do that. A lot 
---
I also like making isk.
---
&gt;The emberessing part is you guys crying this much... and iam sure btw. it dosnt count anyways cause something went wrong and we where just lucky or thats not a big fleet or whatever...
---
CALLED it :)
---
No
---
Eh, wake me up when you kill enough to get our numbers only double of yourse. Then it might get interesting. 
---
It is not just about how many titans did we bring, but also about how many more can we field if those currently deployed die.
---
Best of luck mate. Glad to see you go out on a high note!!
---
Combat anoms, exploration, missions.. there are a lot of things to do solo.
---
Can confirm. Major regret of selling my old accounts.
---
I don’t know, I just don’t like the look of the Neon Caille one so I’m a basic bitch with that army green skin waiting to have a police bus..
---
They’re a part of horde, so no?
---
hmmm i thought accoring to test narrative PL was nonstop clubbing test till they freed themselve without goons help from the shackles ...   
---
Iam no denying that you are not true. But iam just confused that you didnt mentioned your own alliance there. Maybe Fairbait then sry for that...
---
Wrong, the butthurt is even bigger if you 3-4 "Nano-Fags" "farm" kills of their 30-man Homedef ... you should have come in 4 Battleships and brawl like man, so Dunk finally gets to drop his Caps on you on the GE-Gate ...
---
Police one will look good for sure, my personal favorite is the Capsuler Elite skin all the way
---
Congrats on winning. I started winning once I started school, and now that I haven't played in several months I've been wise enough to stay away. Shit is addictive.
---
I'll ask your mom tonight
---
His videos may be funny and he is for sure a chill guy, his thoughts on Meta are just awful, he does not understand key points
---
It is like playing age of empires with you ... as long there is one builder alive you didn't win anything. Congrats
---
This guy using light mode discord lol
---
Just because you weren't there, doesn't mean it didn't happen. I'm sure the folks from unspoken have a BR in hand they can post to fill you in.
---
Probably not very accurate, most groups haven't used there supers a long while other than frat. Skillu having 18 active titans is definitely off lol.
---
Good luck for IRL ;) The most is that you had enjoyed playing EVE ;)
---
Yeah i think a very important trait is knowing what you can do and use that potential and from what ive seen from him (videos and being on the receiving end) i'd say he did that pretty good. Is that being a "brilliant tactician"? Propably not allthough i guess that's a thing of subjective definition. But imo he sure deserves a honorable mention when someone asks for great past FC's.
---
Send me 200bil and I'll send you 400bil back.
---
I for one already applied to karmafleet
---
They are in the P.Horde alliance, this list isn't showing corporations.
---
just shoot it.
---
I killed a lot of this stupid depot. but now all my toon are -10, i cant cloak in HS so i forget about cleaning this shit.
---
Many of us don't have kills with supers yet too.
---
Some people have 1 shield 1 armor titan / fax.
---
The number may be double what you see
---
....Stukas!
---
I think pando excels at those. Shines usually does the heavy stuff. Regular subcap doctrines are quite competently handled by all of them.
---
But I lack comparison to most other names if seen here.
---
Honourable mention to Jay Wright. He was super relaxed and was very systematic and calm in all situations.     
---
I think he liked smaller fleets better but also did a great job at managing more than 250.
---
 [Tek Enetheru](https://zkillboard.com/character/393459787/) 
---
Back when he was in Stain Empire. Dunno if he stills FCs.
---
Andrew you should coordinate a suicide roam as a goodbye
---
he is not getting it :) just leave him alone....
---
Look at NCs Titans per 1000. That's insane. A 3000 man alliance can form half the titans of a 30k alliance.
---
It was PH supers that moved close not NC.
---
Everyone is working with everyone to kill shit in deleve. Theres pretty much a standing rule in delve right now to only shoot goons.
---
What doesn't he understand beyond TL;DR BRAVE announcements? Cry about the meta all you like- He cares about his alliance, and his fellow BRAVE bros. Puts into perspective the NC/PL/North/BoB "we're better than you because skillpoints" rhetoric that's been a thing forever.
---
buy a bunch of my 1mil svipuls, but be quick or someone else might get them!
---
Bastion / tnt / lawn have their own fc too. read what i write ;=) and they do also stuff by themself too.
---
you are probably right for the deployment.
---
Except goons in the past fights have only brought 300-400 titans. Just like this last move OP you had about 400 and NC had 200. The graph seems accurate.
---
CCP Peligro‏ @CCP\_Peligro · 9. Mai  
---
BEING ON THIS LIST DOESN'T MEAN YOUR ALLIANCE IS FILLED WITH BOTS NOW - **data from EVEstart**. 
---
The only point I'll make here is that **0.0 and in particular rental alliances have been disproportionately represented in bot bans for as long as I can remember.**  
---
When you can read this, that is what you dont mention in your claims. I even **marked** the **important Part** for you. If you cant understand this i can for sure tell you why there is and never be a direct gate to Stain if this is still a thing :P
---
What stops them waiting on a can while you burn around instead?
---
Row 19 Column T. No, I don't post that kind of partisan garbage.
---
Well seeing as how ncpl’s whole existence centers around fighting goonswarm, it’s one of those unique mindsets where youd think theyd be happy that content is coming to them.
---
No they sat completely behind everyone else, in Tenal. Talking big.
---
Guess someone should tell these Nyx pilots they've been downgraded to regular carrier status. https://zkillboard.com/related/30002355/201905100100/
---
so wait you anchored a keepstar and lost it or got dropped by a keepstar? I'm confused
---
Corebloodbrothers
---
Don't be silly.
---
The SP thing has died with Injectors. There are more SP per RL-player now in Imperium/Legacy-Space now than in PanFam space.
---
But he still wants to be treated like it was an Issue. Whining about 3-4 Nano-Roamers feathering their 30-Man Homedef and not presenting themselves as static target he can throw Caps at is just dumb, nothing else.
---
Sure thing, you do you, wich in all honesty didnt take you so far.
---
But LTRIG is A Winter Co full member and has always been. But I get it you're salty cuz you got fucked and others didnt.
---
Greygal From Redemption Roams was always a blast to fly with. just dont expect to come back alive
---
You will be back :)
---
Congratulations on winning! Needless to say, those are really cool memories you are making as you wrap up you time in Eve.
---
Best to you!
---
That must hurt...
---
&gt; The SP thing has died with Injectors

Implying everyone in the game buys PLEX

"active within the last 3 months"

Treat em mean, Keep em keen
---
I think it should be ambulance/paramedic skins for logis, not police
---
We already have them on cruisers, triage would be nice
---
Good luck and enjoy the new game! o7
---
I was in that battle and destroyed your caps and forts. Didn't get any chance to get some loot, those were some blingy fits!
---
Recently resubbed, so I am losing again, but congrats on your win.
---
I've never seen more than 350 titans deployed by the north at once. Ever.
---
I have never heard of either.  Is it worth getting?
---
6,9 ftfy
---
Sorry but where do you see something else that i stated?         
---
Data for last 16 years, showing top 25 offenders.      
---
While goons and NCPL is not present there directly we have respective renter groups. NCPL have 16% imprint, Goons have 2%.           
---
At the same time Goons alone are bigger than NC, PL and all rental groups involved.          
---
Sorry but enlighten me what i understand in incorrect way - unless you want to say that "owners" should not be held responsible in any case want their renters do.
---
My favorite part is how OP indicate decimal place with commas
---
Spod brain does that to people.
---
I am not assuming anything. 
---
If you are not in Goons, you may as well be dead.
---
And if you are Goons and wrote that, may Mittani save you.
---
PL probably have a similar number, they just haven't really used them.
---
&gt; Is industry viable for solo players?
---
industry is actually best done solo with multiple characters
---
&gt; I am thinking about starting to research and copy blueprints but looking at the contracts in Jita, it does not look profitable...
---
learn2spreadsheets bro
---
&gt; How do people make money with industry? And do they?
---
they do  
---
no one is going to give you the recipe for success, but google "fuzzysteve", "blacksmoke16" and "evebusinessinsider" for starters

Stay sharp my man, keep this spirit up and maybe one day you will actually get enough people to undock to at least pretend you are defending. :D
---
There’s more to eve outside of crabbing in delve and structure bashes in the north ;)
---
More fun to make historical ennemy alias "elite pvp" unanchored almist everything.
---
Ph is closed to goon spirit, except with less people and more pvp oriented.

Hoped we would have got a fight out of one of these :/
---
As far as i can remember it has always been this way. 
---
If the node has a connection to other 6 nodes, it should be empty. If it is not empty then the endpiece is directly linked to the occupied middle node. 
---
But as i have said before, i have done only like 10 sites last month and i did not meet any deviation from this.
---
Is it? 
---
Not for long if we have anything to say about it!
---
Speak about dropping supercarriers because of Unspoken, then proceed to link a BR full of goons.
---
You better enjoy the fuck out of the secret illuminati subreddits while you can.
---
If you think we care about having goons to fight, you are entirely mistaken. NCPL people lives for content, whatever the people bringing it. We would be pretty happy to fight any other alliance.
---
Where?
---
Also, as someone linked the BR above, I don't get the "You move your super to fight unspoken 200 man alliance §§§!!!" then link a BR with 75% of it being goons.
---
Elite PvP pilots: Bought my ship a few hours ago and it already exceeds the killmark limit!

They count from DT to DT. Don't just look at your time zone.
---
I'm retarded please be kind
---
It's almost like Dotlan numbers are meaningless.
---
Now what are you going to do with that free time? =)
---
Don't sell your account. You will come back one day.

you can search for the regular expression "region: .-R000" to know how many are in j-space
---
3 x shit posting XL rigs.

4 Titan hulls, then resell after this war.
---
If I'm solo hunting in Null, what are my typical targets? How would I typically engage them?
---
Ah damn. Shoutout to you for doing the titan/super sheets, they were really informative. Will you be dicking around in an alpha or are you completely winning EVE?
---
there are always good deals in jita local
---
Harpies already sold out in Jita :X
---
It didn't change. Hes wrong.
---
Have a great summer!
---
Rolling for that dank isk! Great way to leave the game!

---
Safety and Health are way too neglected in our current days.
---
Because PvP is more fun than PvIdiot?
---
With the faction analyzer it's combined data and relic analyzer. Anything you use to add coherence for data adds to the relic part as well and vice versa. The implant raises your strength but lowers your coherence, to the point of you one shot stuff with lots of strength and nothing attacks back making your low coherence not important. Just click click click anywhere.
---
This is actually pretty accurate. I haven't used any of my shield supers in the last 3 months except to bridge, but have used them for PVP in the past. My armor supers are relatively new/in build/i've been busy doing shit away from where they live, so they have yet to see any action. Quite a few of my corp mates are in the same boat.
---
Could someone please anchor the entire communist manifesto in Jita?
---
Sorry that they burned bridges with all of their friends while GSF proved itself honorable.
---
And the person to receive it will be banned by CCP cuz RMT :D
---
Fly safe mate. o7
---
Someone has never been touched by a girl before.
---
Buy up all the drone capillary fluids and wait.
---
We lost in a wormhole but we found our way back with russians
---
GL with what comes next
---
I heard NC is vacating a few systems currently. 
---
If you get your timing right, you can have those for cheap. :)
---
Buy 200b in plex. AFK again come back in a year and boom probably gonna be around 500-600b
---
yes
---
Sounds like Bjornbee. He's pulling some crazy stuff, like messing with a gang in a PvP Occator. He doesn't have background music iirc.
---
Got my goodies, but good to know. I always assumed 0:00 game time. This makes a lot of sense though from a practical standpoint.
---
I can't think of a witty comment.
---
Good luck and fly safe o7
---
Enjoy freedom :)
---
nope. Legacy might be blue but we have our coalition
---
Damn, I wanted to reduce these "arguments" to shit, but my shit meeting is funnier than that.
---
Fuck, i really REALLY want that lavacore skin to be made available for paladins, harbingers, and all of the omen bases.
---
I own very few skins because i just dont care about many of them.  Id buy that one in a heartbeat if it were available for the ships i actually want to fly.
---
Only combat alts are allowed in NC I thought, whereas TEST is like all your indy / ratting / krab alts.
---
You under estimate the rate they are being built and last time was only armor
---
It is indeed very simple. You have no evidence on how many percent came though that timeline of 16 years on a year for year base. This is what Peligro is pointing out. for example since it is an overall statistic it could have been that the 16% in the years 2007 - 2009 where 75%; 2010 - 2013 50%; 2014 - 2017 25 % and are now down to 16% at 09.05.2019. Same the other way around like 2007 - 2009 4 %; 2010 - 2013 8%; 2014 - 2017 12% and now finaly 16 %... 
---
this would have 2 possible outcomes.
---
First the number of Botters lowered during the period of the courent holding Alliance or it growed through it. Ofc a mix is also possible. But what you doing is saying that panfam is resposible for for the decade of 2007 to 2019 which is just not true.
---
Next point is aswell a timelinething.
---
You have an alliance which is alive since 2007 and hast 16% of botter. The number of botters according to an alliance funded 2018 is already 2 %... means when you just calculate a steady growing the 2 % alliance would have a count of 24% after the same period of thime.
---
It dosnt help here at all but in our SOTA vince made it crystal clear when we see a botter we should report them to CCP not like in GSF where they sayed basicly we take care of them ourself. So pick a side on this and tell me what the better way is.   
---
Not want to point towards goons cause every alliance got those kind of dudes but a Battlereport with a dude lost 30 chimeras was pre WWB in the north. There are perhaps same lossmails from BoT i dont know about but iam not insisting we dont have botters too. Claiming NC. is full of botters is just not very accurate and as untrue as saying goons is full of botters.
---
Since english is not my mother language i hope you understand what i wanted to explain.
---
Hi! I got 133 responses so I'm still working through the data.
---
I will remember to give you the complete results.
---
I will post the raw results as an edit to this post :)
---
What I was looking for was whether or not online video games might be good facilitators for positive *intergroup contact*.
---
I am testing this by using the *Contact hypothesis*, as it was proposed in 1954 by Gordon W. Allport. The intergroup contact theory/contact hypothesis is built numerous things which for example suggest that; a) humans are predisposed to categorization, often times binary emotions such as good and bad; b) humans are often predisposed to the concept of 'us' vs. 'them' which is maintained through the creation of in-groups and out-groups (i.e., 'we' = in-group, 'they' = out-group); c) this often results in (or is a result of) prejudice towards people that do not belong to one's in-group. The list goes on, but generally speaking it is about how we create and sustain in-groups and out-groups and how the relationship between the two is often negative. 
---
Allport claimed that by making contact between two conflicting groups, the chance of making positive contact would increase if 4 features/criteria were met (n.b., conflict does not always mean direct violence): 1) equal status, 2) common goals, 3) intergroup cooperation, and 4) support of authorities.
---
Recent research suggests however that having all of these factors is not necessary for positive contact but rather that they can act as facilitators. For example, having members of conflicting groups working together for a short period of time could potentially create a friendship between the two (or at least reduce prejudice).
---
**TL;DR:** Prejudice is often based on misconception and misunderstandings, having the two groups get to know each other might reduce prejudice as they would be faced with evidence contradicting their image of the other.
---
You can read about the theory [here] (https://www.facinghistory.org/sounds-change/gordon-allports-contact-hypothesis) as it would give you a much better explanation.
---
Some of the questions I asked in the survey are of no significance to the analysis as such, but might be useful in answering questions such as: Are people who prefer cooperative game-play more likely to get to know people in an online video game than, for example, people who prefer competitive game-play.
---
The questions about nationality and age can be used to see if there is any difference between countries/continents and/or age in regards to player's likelihood of getting to know people through these games.
---
Number of nationalities in the survey: 27 (the vast majority was from the US and Europe)
---
Average age: 25.5 years (respondents were from age 11 to 54)
---
Oh yeah I get that I just think the other alliances tend to have them and use them, there's a ton of goons members with Titans that don't use them just because there's not much else to do with all the minerals. I built one out of boredom
---
https://youtu.be/wuREEonWGJ8
---
indeed.
---
Spodspeed and spodbless. I hope the end of your Eve career opens a new beginning for you.
---
Enjoy the new freedom!
---
Yes, thats why we all play eve
---
You're not technically wrong. The corp just won't do very well.
---
*3 weeks
---
I wonder how much of that is due to frat accounting for 5% of the total botting in the history of EVE in less than two years.
---
Its a pvp game not a hey lets blue half the game and krab in peace game
---
Random can I have ur stuff  comment 
---
No one ever truly wins eve
---
Going out on your own terms is always best. I just really hope for your sake you don’t regret this in a few months
---
When its 15 of them like he had - nerf wont matter!
---
There is a lot of spin, so I'll clarify. It was leaked they were going to invade Tribute. So the north is pulling up every big structure, ripping out every rig along the way, to avoid fighting over things they cannot defend and putting red on the killboard. They are currently running with the narrative that goons will then go to Tribute, find all of the content gone and turn around and go home. I imagine that narrative isn't going to hold much longer.
---
Grrr goons ... (they’re just fun to hate) 😊
---
Ripped of rigs and structures will not drop frozen corpses :)
---
Can confirm losing drone bay and pg nerf
---
Thank you for the fast response!  I am going to outfit my explorer dude with these!
---
I'm gay
---
Looks like you went out with a bang, good shit.
---
Why would we protect the krabs? They should be deployed right now. There seriously should have zero people in local in Delve, other than Penif derping around trying to be relevant.
---
Never knew you but you seem like a decent guy, have fun winning eve :)
---
Thanks for doing the giveaway. I'm a new player I could use some help.
---
Oh look, someone who is utterly clueless.
---
It’s a euro thing.
---
Always enjoyed your threads about super statistics, sad to see you go.
---
Well at least he won't be jammed every 5 seconds.
---
Because the passive earning potential of 5m sp is absurd.
---
Pi, reactions, manufacturing, research, invention, etc.
---
A lot of it is only available to omega accounts.
---
If so farming is negative, just farm 1 char of the 3 on the account to keep it omega for a tiny cost while having the passive income potential of 3 accounts. Then once so farming becomes viable again, spin up the farms.
---
Jita local firesales always seem to have great value.
---
&gt; now it's not self-sustaining anymore
---
Good.
---
This is a ridiculous comment. Goons have never formed more than 350 titans for a timer. Period. They brought everything last time. Are you new?
---
Blueballs tend to not kill a lot of titans sadly.
---
i can recommand karmafleet, Pandemic Horde or any other big alliances newbean alliance... they are all pretty solid. Just find the on which suits you the most or just try some of them.
---
Most of them even have homepages where you can register or first read their offerings and standarts...
---
No all alts are allowed in NC.
---
OP "I am a stab fitted VNI shitbag - basically nothing more than a bot.  But im going to talk smack to this one Goon because lolgons and i want reddit karma."
---
Things not used are useless. Just like goons have 600+ titans on zkill but they cant form more than 350 for a timer.
---
No. I guess you'll just have to wait and see how many form now it's not just armor
---
Nothing, but you can warp of any time.
---
Warping back in needs some time, can't be aborted,  and if you don't stay cloaked they can guess the can you are going to and just decloak, wait out their recalibration time and tackle you as soon as you land.
---
See you back in Star Citizen.
---
Least you went out with a bang in J Space literally!  
---
Good luck with your RL adventure
---
Personally, if she’s not slowly dieing from oxygen deprivation I can’t maintain an erection
---
Penif and friends are no friends of the Swarm.
---
We (INIT) work with SNUFF quite a bit in Pure Blind and have been helping Pure Blind Madness a bit in USTZ against Nu Pure Blind.  
---
Overall, Shines I think has a pretty good relationship with SNUFF leadership and we tolerate each other well enough.  
---
It definitely is an interesting dynamic though anytime a part of a group blues up someone outside the group and that entity then attacks a group member.  
---
My expectation is the (minor) impact on Delve isn't considered a priority at the moment and no meaningful tension results.
---
Yes goons is bigger than the North. Are people still debating this?
---
Tell that to my -10.0 tickered PI alt
---
It's almost like we only usually use the armor ones eh?
---
Seriously are you new?
---
&gt;Mactep
---
Now there's a name I haven't heard for a while
---
Who's talking about the goons? I made a statement based on observation. Take a hike with your need to turn everything into us vs. them.
---
See you, eve winner.
---
Best of luck in whatever adventures you get into in future. Your spreadsheets were interesting.
---
sounds like it was a good ride, good luck further o7
---
Hey if I win, give the isk to the most downvoted comment ITT
---
Man, if only there was an alliance that had ran that test on the test server before being invaded, and then realized the nerf didn't do shit and unanchored everything.
---
They jumped out all of their large assets before the timer was up/killed without engaging.
---
how many years have we been waiting for that?
---
Because paying 200m to plex a account is better than paying 2b
---
Also skillfarm profit goes up and down depending on when/where/how you buy plex/extractors/mptc and sell injectors, profits are have always been super tight and between +-200m per account
---
Ew I feel dirty
---
Get a JF(s) and work for one of the courier companies. Send me what’s left over as compensation for this fine pro tip.
---
Gimmie gimmie, I'm new to eve feed me money.
---
I wonder how many of these are just "drop all the things on that kitchen sink frigate roam" and how many are experiencing something more serious.
---
i guess its like cheese. cheese is pretty cheap, until its 10years old and manky then its expensive :)
---
From someone who has tried to win eve, you're best to unsub from this sub too because that's what dragged me back each time. Just reading about fun shit I probably won't do because I'm not very good at Eve.
---
I suggest sending me about 10-20 Billion.
---
You won't make anything off it but I could finally train out of frigates and into some tech 3 ships or something so I can handle those relic and data sites that require combat.
---
yeah...something Horde is still pissed about &lt;.&lt;
---
keep in mind PH's opinion of GOTG, differs from PLNC.
---
and theres alot in PH who wish we could take a few shots at NC for it.....
---
Yup I remember him, he and VOTFXirtam and Foyle. God what a bunch of nuts lol
---
The Ninazu can still perform amazingly well because it doesn't sacrifice anything to have mids full of injectors.  The Lif however can't fit two injectors without sacrificing so much tank that a Minokawa is better.
---
If I read the posts of last days right, a lot of people really seem to look forward to shoot uncontested structures in TiDi created only by themselves ....
---
No, it is Stream 360 No Scoping
---
Its not about plex, and delve's rapid super-capitalization is proof of that.
---
That is because it defaults back to that when the object you are looking at docks up.
---
Basically, in heavy TiDi a full tank Wyvern has the strongest tank of them all. Passive shield recharge is not influenced by time dilation ... think about it ....
---
Let’s see ... am I (still) addicted?
---
12 years on 2 accounts, 11 years on 1 account and 6 years on a fourth.  Never plex’d. That’s over $7,000 USD paid to CCP.  Yup, I’m addicted.
---
Anyone who has a good investment idea worth 200b isnt gonna post it on reddit :)
---
Boat and the init bomber fcs are artists at bombing runs on occasion
---
They pay for sov, not personal protection. Its basic renter agreements everywhere.
---
Thanks for playing with us!
---
I need to look into the blackglass implant, didn't even know it was a thing, but I might worry about the coherence loss.  But that is a huge perk to strength. I really need to get better at this.
---
The effect of passive shield recharge not being influenced by TiDi is also a factor ....
---
totally owned that rifter coming into the novice plex using my bomber and cloaked hel
---
Well tbh if faxes need so many injectors - for me something is wrong with the whole concept of the ship.       
---
Like how often do you see injectors on subcapital logistic ships.
---
Anyone know if characters with unique/rare names have any value on the Bazaar? I snagged the name of my favourite rockstar back when CCP reset trial account names, but never played with the character.
---
Run trace when this happens and you will see where are problems.
---
They always come back...
---
it's pretty bad. the game encourages blobbing, and everyone joins a corp and thinks blobbing is normal. this game has no sportsmanship culture, and a "fair fight" to the people who play is just similar to "whining" or whatever. the only single player experience you're going to have is cloaky warfare and you'll have to claw and fight and run away constantly for any chance at it, only to fall at some cancerous gatecamp eventually anyways.
---
Keep in mind the Zeugma analyzer is very very pricey, talking 150m+ last I checked. With the implant and everything that's basically around 200m (before even thinking of cargo) for a covops that will explode to an untimely fart. Pretty much only cost effective on exploration t3cs.
---
See you, space cowboy
---
Ccp might have just given people 1m sp
---
There were over 600 on the first moveop in USTZ
---
WOW Vanilla
---
join the warcorps first, learn thy enemy (and all the mechanics) if you do not, you will fail. sorry to be blunt.
---
damn what exactly do you hate so much in the game?
---
He is just salty because he was made to leave Winterco space and now is trash tier darkness pet, even they don't like you, getting wrecked by random small groups because he has no idea what he are doing.   
---
I feel bad for the poor corporations that get tricked into joining his alliance only to suffer his arrogance and ridiculously unjustified ego. :(
---
Yeah it's not a good position to be in. I would never define myself by capital PvP because it just doesn't happen. I have them as a deterrent against eviction and that's it.
---
Ok...
---
If you are a casual goon and have 10 Rorquals Chars/Accounts that do nothing else than chew dem rocks and have all the skills needed for that, why you should not use the opportunity to lower your subscription cost from somewhat 2Bil+ to 200 Mio ISK per 30 days?
---
Sat in station spinning my ship while waiting for skill training to complete.
---
Same thing happening to me, USCT
---
i dont get what you mean, we would fight idiots regardless
---
right?
---
Fucking FSync.
---
Goodbye my friend.  You were always entertaining and never boring.  Always with a new hatched plan or the next large endeavor.  Your corp will miss you.  Your alliance will miss you and, most importantly, your Eve friends will miss you.  Please try to stay in touch.
---
\~Exo
---
I know some people do this, but I can't imagine welping a Titan for fun.
---
had mining drones at least
---
Wasnt the last X-47  battle around 650 goon+ friends titans vs 600 or so north titans? I remember we outnumbered them, but it wasnt by all that much to be honest..
---
Same exact thingy for me :(
---
Keep sperging, maybe one day it will become real
---
That was cool to watch. On a side note, that door riddle sucked.
---
Hunting as in ganking? Very much so. There's usually an unhacked relic site that can be camped. Shattered systems also have more connections, making them relatively high traffic.
---
i guess we could say the same thing about NC. (it was all horde).
---
Good suggestion re WoL. Two reasons not using: 1) has not been reliable for me and 2) only external access to my network I’ve setup is via HomeKit. HomeKit doesn’t support WoL without a hack called HomeBridge. Have not taken the time to setup yet.
---
Funnily enough, we don't care if those remaining spodbrains get blown up. They had several weeks notice to be smart about shit and safe up their shiny rorqs but they refused to listen. We don't even respond to save them, fuck all if they die. We just want the free kills that come with responding.
---
Shit, we'll kill them ourselves for being dumb.
---
The only exception is that Erebus that recently died in 1DQ. He got baited by a fake fleet name/invite, which is against the EULA/TOS. P sure it was Horde. Hope he gets his stuff reimbursed.
---
Its how the modern world does it, go back to america
---
I get what you mean.
---
I don't necessarily mean specifics. But I was thinking something like rough things to keep an eye out for.
---
Letelio Denmun from the Dead Terrorists. Every time we were up against the world and were outnumbered he would somehow pull victories out of thin air.
---
What did you enjoy most in EVE?
---
Hyperbole, my friend. We will destroy and rape anything that stays in our way. 
---
If there are no corpses, even exhaust vents will have to do the job.
---
Yes.  Should invest in ihubs.
---
Oof. Who hurt you?
---
I promise to use the 5B on drugs
---
CCPlease fix your end of the game
---
Nooooooooooooooooo dont leave :0
---
Check if not in one of Goon staging systems, TiDi is a bitch. :D
---
Hi Andrew.
---
A short tale, if you have the time.
---
Yesterday I stumbled across a WH. Inside I spotted 5 fortizars. 4 of which were anchoring. With 9,5hrs to go.. I noticed zero hole control and 4 wormholes available to build chains, nearly all with suitable entry options.
---
I simply informed a few good friends and we mobilised.
---
Whilst some great work from the mighty beans kept use from getting all our fleet in, a compromise was met and we brought in the fleets, formed a temporary coalition and went to reinforcing all 4 fortizars. With each of the forts spread 2 minutes apart over 8 minutes, this wasn't easy to hold.
---
You warped your caps in, was it 13? I forget... And we danced for some 3 hours. I had alot of fun.  Thank you for the fight and sorry about the drake.
---
I was upset when you started safe logging the caps once the fight tipped into our advantage, but respectfully understand.
---
If I am can, anchoring 4 forts at once is a bold move. Assuming guys are going to remain in here, if be careful highlighting how much isk may exist in there... But if they.MUST have 5 forts total, then they should consider hole control as a priority for the anchoring period and maybe not have them share the same grid, so you can make watching them harder and give you more options.
---
My 2 cents worth.gf.
---
Also.please accept this as my entry for the RNG isk Give away.
---
Specifically stated he didn't want a corp. Might come as a shock, but there are actually people who try the corp game and don't enjoy it as much as doing their own thing. The sandbox is what you make of it after all.
---
I go through periods of solo play myself, usually end up joining a corp after a while but don't think I've ever managed to stick around in any one for more than a year. It's nice to have absolutely zero responsibilities or obligations every now and then, especially when you're an antisocial old fuck like me :)
---
Not even just PB but the middle of the region, where literally all the traffic passes through. Big oof.
---
Lol the hidden weeb
---
TIKLE is missing a shit ton compared to the last update because it hasn't used them at all (there's like 30+ afaik...)
---
retards usually get angry when they can't get their dicks at you..
---
I don't know if it helps directly, but faction drones possess a lot more tank and are regarded as a lesser threat than T2 drones. If I expect my drones to be attacked, I always swap for faction drones.
---
posting for money and you'll be back
---
Oh no, I love these active super updates, going to miss seeing them :(
---
yeee corp1. That's what, ten years ago now?
---
Gib 5 bil
---
I mean I've dropped a lot of dreads. Gotten kills and killed every time, so that part of capital PVP is healthy at least, but everyone is afraid of being part of the first real super brawl since FAX changes.
---
woo woop gl HF
---
rip ibis
---
It's a pity market trading ain't your thing, could do some great market manipulations with that amount of isk. You're my opposite though, I like market but don't have that sorta isk lying about.
---
well, this make sense to me
---
Yuh
---
I don't think they had that many undocked at once, maybe? They departed around 20 % damage through hull. I'm not saying it was a good or bad decision, more just relaying what I observed. Also, it was probably closer to 400 on both sides first fight and the same or maybe more on 2nd. By the third all of the late comers had arrived from the south and it was a clear numbers advantage.
---
Yes, i think the same, but somehow it continues to happens
---
kek at including bot and excluding pblrd.
---
I hope you will be able to move on. Us players will always be there for you in case you want to come back. :)
---
Get a good pair of sun glasses, sunscreen and a wide brim hat.  It's bright out there.
---
This. Ive had more fun with spectre and bombers bar than any of the alliances i have been in.
---
Well glad to hear your fights were fun. Would love the isk haha :)
---
Would you recommend EVE to a curious friend?
---
Best of luck
---
Advanced spaceship command V and part of Jump Drive Operation V on my main, which I’m training into a fax. 
---
I’ll probably use it for Invulnerability Core Operation V on my alt, but I may use it for something else if it trains before I can get my main into a fax.
---
oof, rip my dude, I hope you'll have a great life.
---
Shouldn’t be an issue to just open your character selection screen and to login on a character on the other side of the galaxy away from the Goon horde
---
Well good luck out there mate!!
---
What you moving on to?
---
Enjoy your freedom!
---
I wouldn't bother mate - this guy has drank the coolaid
---
Rest in spaghetti never forgetti drake
---
What the fuck is wrong with eating rice
---
Was an awesome fight to be a part of. Definitely one of my highlights since moving to J-Space in February.
---
Wormholes are some of the best content in EVE right now We get sick content every day out here without the nullsec drama.
---
&gt; We (INIT) work with SNUFF quite a bit in Pure Blind 
---
&gt; have been helping Pure Blind Madness a bit in USTZ against Nu Pure Blind.

what else would you do in pb with snuff other than that?
---
&gt; Overall, Shines I think has a pretty good relationship with SNUFF leadership and we tolerate each other well enough. INIT. definitely has a closer operational working relationship with SNUFF than with Goons outside of major deployments. 
---
All the init leadership has some pretty great relationships with hy and tau, saying the groups "tolerate" each other is pretty laughable given that init is *that* close to snuff. You don't tolerate each other, you work together bringing pando, dark shines and numbers. When 2/3 of your fcs were banned it was snuff that unironically was fcing for ya lmao.
---
Its not complicated really, snuff after leaving the imp has 2? blues: wangs and init. . The rest of the imperium isn't one of them, therefore they're free game. The uptick in imperium drops by snuff is quite obvious when you factor in elitist ops joining.
---
Or just run asteros
---
&gt; Nothing is burning except a few krabs who deserve it.  
---
I missed you Bob &lt;3 [https://youtu.be/vC5UTUAxgpE?t=156](https://youtu.be/vC5UTUAxgpE?t=156)
---
Congrats on winning EVE!
---
Yesterday I could not even get the character selection screen. Now I'm trying to invesigate the reasons with Falcon.
---
Cercis
---
See you soon!
---
Very cool way to go out, hope you have fun with whatever you end up doing next!
---
Congratulations on your victory in Eve
---
Wow the wall of shame sure grew since I saw it Sunday. I'm almost surprised
---
CCP will blame our side before they see/find out/realize it’s something wrong with their end!
---
No. We are free of the burden of sov and Tribute will soon be retaken by Panfam the moment the Imperium will go back home.
---
I use an interceptor. Nullfied. Less than 2 second align. Can warp off after someone uncloaks faster than they can target you except for a stealth bomber. Assuming you are paying attention. Just use a regular cloak at a safe spot if you need to sit for a while. Otherwise just keep moving.
---
Message me in 2 months when goons have gone home, the north has been reclaimed, and life has changed for no one outside of panfam and the imperium.
---
Not profitable BY itself at this point. 
---
With a bit of PI, it's still ok. 
---
If you want to use those accounts, it will get your sub price down anyway.
---
After living in FW space solo for a year or two, I made the move back to null to do some roaming - it’s been a while and I’ve died a lot having a lot of fun, lawless space is the best. 
---
Also, delay local )
---
I'm still building up to the point that losing a regular capital isn't painful. I can't honestly comprehend having that much money.
---
If it goes this way I'll just cancel subscription. I don't feel like paying for the game I can't even log in.
---
One of the systems at the very bottom of the map, xx death’s, has 1100 people in it a while ago, and frat systems were p busy, so not sure if something is (or is about to) happen there..
---
And they say we take this game too seriously. :DDD
---
Yeah , we were to busy to play on our goons main characters.
---
Several times lately the rule of 6 hasn't worked. First time I thought it was odd but didn't think much about it but the second time I had to control that it really was a 6-way node (or whatever it's called).
---
Can i randomly be the random person... randomly lol
---
Sorry to call bullshit on this one, but did goons help outspoken? As soon as NC/PL/PH and friends turned their guns goons left. Outspoken was in the way of those guns.
---
Interesting data, thanks for pulling it together
---
Remember before the minigame? You just pressed the hacking module and waited...and waited...till maybe it successfully hacked
---
Ehhhh thats not always true. A stratios properly fit will easily kill most other t3s.. 
---
Theyre actually one of the most fear inducing ships in the game from my perspective lol. Amd cheap compared to a T3 with fitting.
---
take care they may be a bit rusty so dont get  blood poisoning
---
Someone paid for that many accounts or used an alpha in creative ways.
---
Wolfs was a riot to fly under, though watching him try and figure out what to do with any frigates in fleet was just humorous.
---
he fell for the meme
---
No worries, we eat spod and shit pure tritanium.
---
As others have said. Find out about these channels:
---
TheBeehive
---
Bombers Bar
---
Spectre Fleet
---
They run regular fleets that anyone can join and you are guaranteed fun if all you have is 5-7 hrs max per week.
---
Otherwise low sec solo pvp is still a thing so you can give that a go.
---
You won't be able up do Serpentis 4/10 either then, first pocket you might be able to clear though it'll take forever, the second pocket the incoming dps is gonna be too much probably and the overseer battleship reps hard.

Hello Capsuleer, Archduke here.
---
Thank you for contacting the Player Experience Team. This is a mass reply to all players who submitted tickets concerning the XVI Anniversary event.
---
I'm sorry to hear that you were unable to fully utilize the 16th Anniversary of EVE campaign, but unfortunately we cannot provide rewards that you have not claimed in this case, and we can regretfully not extend the event itself. The campaign was following the rules outlined below:
---
The campaign was live from the 2nd of May till the 20th of May 2019. giving players 18 days to claim a total of 16 rewards.
---
The Anniversary rewards were available to be claimed until the downtime (11:00 EVE time) on the 20th of May 2019. as advertised and as per the intended game mechanics. This was shown by a countdown in the "XVI Anniversary Celebration" window, counting down first the days and then the hours left from the campaign. *The Day 1 reward was the first an account could claim, regardless of which day of the event they claimed it on. They could then claim the 2nd reward the day after, and so on.
---
If an Alpha account would upgrade to Omega at any time during the event, they would receive all Omega rewards for the previously claimed days upon their next claim (they would also get a new claim button upon opening the event window, if that was on a day where they already claimed the rewards)
---
We can regretfully not make any exceptions to these rules, and can as such unfortunately not assist you in this case. That being said, I understand that this time-frame may have been too short for some of our players, and I hope that we can further improve our events in the future. We would appreciate your feedback regarding this – I would encourage you to consider posting your thoughts about this on the EVE Online forums in the Event Feedback - XVI Anniversary Celebrations! thread, or to highlight your concerns to the CSM. They ensure that the voices of the EVE community are heard and you can either post on the CSM section of the forum or contact them directly.
---
I understand that this is not ideal, and I do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause!
---
Best Regards,

CCP Player Experience | EVE Online

stupid corporations and their mandatory daily CTAs
---
Logged in to catch some sweet sweet login rewards and noticed that a POCO I'd deployed months ago during a short-lived wormhole stint with RL friends had been reinforced. Shot a PM to the attacker and was surprised when they answered. Offered to come back in and transfer ownership to save them a few bullets, potentially made new friends and might re-sub to start a new chapter in New Eden.
---
The overseer battleship took like 45 minutes but i managed to grind it down eventually. Was given an OPE ;-;
---
If you give it to me, I'll double it.
---
The Spire is left in ruin and Malpais were a nightmare to krab for weeks. This eviction doesn't event feel bad for us , we managed to delay the eviction with the kind help of the Imperium and pissed off Nc high command in the end.  Our lost will never top their lost in this campaing Isk and infrastructures wise.
---
The real true tragedy in this is that ER will now lost its freedom and return to be a renters wasteland for years to come , like it used to be under the DRF. With SkillU evicting Veracruz in the east of the region, the Meobius Group and Silver Dragon will be last small independant groups in the region.
---
I doesn't include Coastal Brotherhood in the list , since they had batphoned Horde a couple time in the past to save their astra , to a point I incline to believe they are Panfam proxies.
---
Beat me to it.
---
Oh damn I wouldn't have thought it was possible to take that down without medium drones at minimum. I usually blitz the site with my stratios and walk off with 50-200m each time.
---
See you in a year when you get the bug. And in 16 months when you full resubmit and regret blowing it all up. Everyone returns.
---
Im literally the poorest eve player lol. Pick me =)
---
imagine being in theran and trusting your esi to a nerd who'll literally say the numbers on reddit without even being provoked lmao
---
Mom, is that you?
---
They made their stand. Respect earned from almost every corner of N.E.
---
You just be quiet and go to unanchor something else.
---
This is why, Goons and Friends has +50% of the people and NCPL are alone. This kind of sh** is the best propaganda that imperium could have to make their numbers still rise.
---
Yeah fair
---
I wont lie i have no clue who you are but me and 2 friends have been trying to run our own noob corp and funding would be great for our frig replacement program.
---
Mains? anyone have a titan on their main?
---
He was real good at fighting outnumbered, we fought goon fleets twice our size and traded well during the war in fade last year
---
Almost certainly got something blown up and couldnt handle it.
---
&gt; Its a pvp game not a hey lets blue half the game and krab in peace game
---
Since Lifeblood shifted the SRP-capable-income-Meta towards Farms&amp;Fields, I am not so sure about that anymore ....
---
The hypocrisy of this post amuses me. Please continue.
---
Seems much better advice indeed.
---
If the imperium is half the game then why backstab the allies you'd need againt them? If they wanted PvP content, why not just attack the guys you have bad "standings" with?
---
Truly, Lawn will not see posting like his again.
---
Me being quite potato with ny skills and stuff i can fit, I've used this rule all the time, and it worked like charm for me. I think this is a great tip to gi e to newbees, and i still use it.
---
corp1, more than that. allstars, maybe about 10-11
---
Maybe thats why they down there to PvPleb and avoid the PvIdiots in Tribute ?
---
can confirm, i run 5x vni and use the tiberizzle method - most people who hunt vnis are not mentally prepared to fight 5 of them at the same time

Look at all. those. shield. titans.
---
what the fuck did you just say to me, you little bitch?
---
Undocked. Died. \\o/
---
Yeah, I run imperial drones since I don’t have heavy V. It’s okay, guess I’ll afk a bit less
---
&gt; for a decade.
---
Considering the pretty expansive number of threads waffles have internally posted for things like running lvl 5's and whoring LP through FW I'd say things moved on a while ago.
---
To be really specific, nobody made fun of anybody for krabbing, people made fun of people for DYING while krabbing.
---
you ever considered that 1k vs 1k battles are boring as fuck and not what most of the playerbase wants?
---
Yesterday [Jita](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bqiu33/jita_local_today/), today Inis-Ilix. Who knows where they will strike tomorrow.
---
Yup, got that one saved for when I eventually get my bus
---
uhm... never came across those.
---
thats just CCP being retarded and not understanding what their changes does when combined with other changes 
---
Pretty sure this isn't CCPs intended state of eve
---
Best of luck to you in RL. Fly safe, be well.
---
Rule of 6 applies but when you reach L5 on hacking and archeology and install one of the faction combined analyzers you don't really need that rule anymore :)
---
The angel overseer reps for about the same amount but has the passive shield regen on top. The serpentis one since its armor doesn't get that. So over time i was pecking it down for about 8.7 dps after reps. 
---
And speed tank mitigates most of the damage, only long range destroyers are even spooky the rest of it only missiles touch me.
---
if subcaps had an SMA with the ability to fit 1000+ boosters then youd see it more often.....
---
Sounds like you had a lot of fun. Grats!
---
Gib 5b and I will finally plex without spending real cash
---
Don't be bitter.
---
Its not just the game that encourages blobbing - its simply human to prefer "power in numbers" - no matter what changes CCP bring to Eve, pilots will still blob.
---
I disagree with the above. There are many fair fights to be found in lowsec for the casual player for example. Eve in null sec though a bit harder to deal with various entities' home defence fleets.
---
I have encountered countless examples of sportsmanship where pilots will honour a 1 v 1 even though they got friends in local if you ask.
---
EVE really is what you make of it. That's the whole point of an MMO on this scale.
---
did you sensor your own swear word?
---
Just had a look at your post history, a shame to see someone who's been actively making content/taking part in the community go :(
---
o7 So long and thanks for all the fish
---
ccplz remove tether, local, let combat probes find cloaked t1 frigates, and make CONCORD respond to jump drive activation
---
why did you bleep out your own swear?
---
Cheers for going out in style.
---
This past week, I hammered out an omni-tank, blaster Proteus to run level 4 missions in.
---
Learning how to fly it in AE Bonus pocket was a nice challenge.  Almost lost it vs Shadow; trigger popped and I was not prepared for the DPS + webs.  Gogo overheating!
---
It's been a blast!
---
I have started an investment into EvEs first palantine keepstar if you would like to donate.
---
I plan on commemorating all donors of 10b+ with a supplementary citadel on the same grid.
---
yeah no i know the guides posted for farming out in gulm and stuff. but the culture of waffles was "OMG WHY U JEWING WTF U JEW", at least circa 2015-2017. Not sure how it changed after they joined PL and how it is now as I've had almost no contact and all of my old friends from there moved on to other corps except Loki who will never leave.
---
Eve Isk per hour sounds like what you are referring to.
---
You could add in apis and it would check skills and essentially say what would be potentially be profitable.
---
I stopped using it a while ago, and I don't think it's maintained.
---
True.
---
Great scam.   Rent and then use 3rd party accounts to harvest additional "revenue".
---
o7 dude, see you whenever the addiction calls you back
---
When are they gonna make the Nyx police skin actually worth buying?
---
Depends on the situation you're talking about
---
Not sure why you got downvoted, this is the next step. Eve has its own network diagnostics/trace route in the launcher. This is almost certainly a problem with your ISP or some hop along the way.
---
I'm feeling lucky, send the isk to DONJUAN v ingame when I won. Thanks!
---
Paid to put in on contract. What?
---
Pro tip: invest all your irl skill points into Charisma and Intelligence.
---
I can respect Snuff, they are the most trustworthy TBH. They will kill almost anyone for content. I fully expect them to be shooting us in the north as soon as good start doing stuff, even though they are currently shooting Goons with us.
---
Ya, I think that's what it was. Shame its not maintained. 
---
Know of anything that offers a similar service?
---
Self rep logi almost always has either a cap booster or ancils though.
---
No, that's some new guy.
---
It was back when tech1 frigates got buffed.
---
I think he removed his channel, can't find any of those cool videos, oh well
---
Fly safe o/
---
I always drag them to the screen I want. You could use ISBoxer for it I suppose
---
Got it. Thanks.
---
Okay, thank you.
---
Same, but since it's always the same client to the same screen I was wondering if it could done automatically
---
!
---
DUAL HYPEEEEE
---
The word of the day here is "dumb" its the idiots that are still in full crab mode. Not the semi conscious crabs but the full on spod brained morons that are feeding.
---
Congrats on winning eve (as if it hasn't been said enough) and I hope you have fun with your newly cleared up schedule. o7
---
Never say no to free ISK :)
---
What's 'eatting', precious??
---
Kb looks active to me
---
I know a guy who can turn that 5b into 1b.
---
That guy is me.
---
congratz on winning eve.
---
QUITTING EVE FIRESALE 9.7B
---
I petitioned to CCP, and they denied the request with a very long answer. I thanked the GM, not before unsub my last account. I just won EVE!
---
at ship
---
How come there was around 250 Titans in the first moveop, including at the very least 45 Ragnaroks and 26 Leviathans? Hmm..
---
I promise to use your 5b gift to whelp a thousand frigates
---
In which moveop?
---
Loki's a fucking boss
---
The numbers are definitely low for imperium, but it's hard to realistically capture the active number of supers/titans in any way but the way OP did it. It ain't perfect but it does work.
---
Good luck winning EVE, I have yet to find a game that keeps me away for long
---
they might only have 13 active titans but they're probably all faction titans
---
I guess you'll just have to go 2nd and turn 400bill into 800.
---
As jin said both to cva diplo and ccp. We don’t like bots
---
police bus is something ive been waiting for since the skin glitch aka one of the best weekends in eve online
---
The results are in and The Mr Beast tactic of giving out free money works super well.
---
Also congrats on winning eve!
---
Fly safe in another land o7
---
Random comment passing by
---
Aeons are supposed to have something in mid-slots, right?
---
So the game, launcher has been working fine for months and then they do a mini update and now is my fault on my end?  Sucking the CCP twig and berries deep much?
---
God speed and congrats on winning EvE, I won EvE a few months ago. Best decision ever and I dont miss it
---
I love you, please don't leave!
---
I still maintain it. 
---
http://eveiph.github.io/
---
I still maintain it. I had some downtime due to my son being born and missed the esi update but it’s updated now. 
---
Faction warfare
---
I should not have used all my remaps in kindergarden. :D
---
I like rice it's good
---
o7 fly safe irl
---
t3 production mats 
---
ladars are hilariously cheap because of Chinese botters/broadcasters in wormholes, they used to be a huge amount of the cost to build a loki, now its ludicrously cheap
---
I like the hacking game, I just don’t like the loot tables. It’s not worth the effort sadly.
---
Gimme some injectors and a titan and I'll show you that nothing is impossible :)
---
Look up the triglavian stuff, new triglavian update/ships coming out in a week so you will see spike in certain items.. I’ve almost doubled my initial investment cash with some items haha
---
... yet you commented...
---
killboard is partially responsible for this, not just CCP. CCP could for instance eliminate outsized warfare on gates. for instance, only allowing blinkin g opponents to pvp at gates. the killboard however rewards 900 pilots taking down 1, and that's why this game blows.
---
tool to use is Eve-O Preview, it saves beside other stuff the position of your client's window(s)
---
urgaypwnd
---
And don't forget all the backup titans
---
Fly safe, wherever the next jump leads you. o7
---
then you need to use windowed mode, and who wants that ugly white line at the top
---
The north reports suspected botters and they get banned, where as goons get told, there is nothing to see here move along. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWCz3BBfmPE&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWCz3BBfmPE&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
wow. great read. thx for that
---
Oh awesome! And congratulations!
---
Can confirm, I've used this method to revert a portrait change from a saved image of the old portrait. It works, eventually.
---
6 months max
---
Is that why NCPL kept attacking their former allies? I get that large TiDi battles are boring but that doesn't seem to have much to do with this.
---
You reap what you sow, and NCPL has sown enemies.
---
I wish I were rich enough, I don't even need a Titan, just need a couple.bil to fund PvP addiction
---
indeed he is. nicest guy irl too.
---
since Tishu disbanded
---
o7 man, have fun with whatever you decide to do next
---
That wh space blob
---
Really good that you spend your lasts fighting and putting all the sp and isk to an actual use. GL with RL fly safe.
---
I wouldn't worry about being a target. The only place juicy targets matter is suicide ganking in hi-sec. Everywhere else, people will try to kill you no matter what you're flying.
---
and wings was sitting on 2% after being a bot alliance for years and years and years 
---
it seems this list is more about the quality of the bots, chinese bots are trash who would have thought it
---
Contemplated it
---
You know there is a windowed fullscreen mode?
---
10 years in and I still feel like I've only scratched the surface.
---
Why have you not try something you never tried on eve ? Like for example I recently left nullsec for the first time and tried WH and it made me log again on a daily basis :p
---
rude.
---
He was also good at feeding while outnumbering the enemy. What made him a famous FC wasn't being good at it, it was taking every fight he possibly could and as an alliance leader had the means to keep going even if he fed fleet after fleet because he didn't have to explain himself to anyone.  
---
In the end we never found out how many fleets he can whelp because of the ban.
---
You don't need an external tool to do this. First, in the launcher, make sure your clients are not all sharing the same settings. Create a new group for each client so they don't overwrite each others settings.
---
In the graphics settings in-game there is a dropdown box that should list something like "&lt;your graphcs card&gt; 1",  "&lt;your graphcs card&gt; 2",  "&lt;your graphcs card&gt; 3" etc. These are your monitors. Select which one you want for each client and then it should be saved the next time you start that account through the launcher.
---
I am pretty sure this all only works if you are using Fullscreen Windowed mode or Fullscreen mode. If you are just using Windowed mode (why?) I recommend switching to Fullscreen Windowed.
---
Without the rmt how will the multi-dollar empire feed  the children?
---
Or run cloaky interdicted t3 with low aligntime. The only time you get caught, most likely will be at the site. Mind you, I don't run sites atm, so idk whats changed. Also I ran most of the time in friendly space, so I had a t3 with brawling capacity against frigates, to hunt neutral scanners.
---
police pursuit erebus? surely this must be the work of the GSM influencing the art department as there is a war going on
---
You should make your corp. Just not yet. You have only played for a few weeks so you don't have the knowledge, experience, or contacts to run a corp. Since you want to make a merc corp join up with a pvp corp and eventually give FCing a shot. You'll meet me people and make friends that might want to help your achieve your goal. 
---
Answering your question, I'm assuming you're talking about defending highsec corps. Most are garbage unfortunately, if you are allying with them to defend a structure dont expect much more from them then one dude randomly smashing buttons on a poorly fit citadel.
---
Shame? I thought it was survival of the fittest at work! Literally a badge of honor.
---
ISK doubling services
---
quality post. you probably should join sma
---
why not tell people to move by themselves at this point already, not like it's very complicated
---
Thanks for you kind wisdom sir
---
I've done several hundred and this is indeed still the case. If a note with 6 connection has a bad node in it, that means that the goal is right next to it.
---
for a moment i thought local was full of naked avatars, but this checks out too
---
Wish you all the best irl.
---
Any tips for a dude wanting to start cap building?
---
don't you need to make a new profile for every account to do this tough? Thats fine for a couple accounts but a paint in the ass with 50+
---
Sweeeeet.
---
Sweeeeeet!
---
what allies? PANFAM is 3 alliances, PL, NC. and Horde, every other allied alliance have been because of a shared interest and something every side knew wouldn't last.   
---
MBC was designed with the intention to be enemies after it disbanded
---
I was just thinking about getting back into eve, it turns out winning isn't forever, the wormholes still call to me.
---
Yeah. Industry is very profitable at high ends, though be aware that many things lots of people want to make (like lots of t1 ships) make negative profits, because people don't understand mining stuff yourself doesn’t make it free. The advice I’ve seen given here before tends to point to the little hidden things, that are used enough to give a fast turnover, but not so much that the market is saturated. T1 and t2 Rigs are good, especially if you can salvage a lot to get your own materials.
---
Especially with the new stuff coming soon...
---
^ is a hater of good supercapital design
---
unspoken is attacking panfam renters and unironically phoned goons to help, not the other way around. That's like complaining that goons would blob someone hard if they attacked delve (let alone if they phones panfam to do so).
---
Undock your dreads and you could have beaten us! Ha ha ha!
---
Why aren't they feeding in to my guns? Ha ha ha!
---
I am elite!
---
Eve Online, more like keepstar online.
---
I am a casual pleb, have only 4 Accounts and 3 profiles (running triple screen setup 27" x 3) 4th Account on same screen as 1st with on-top-replica
---
it depend what you fly. 
---
Personaly, I use a max dps hecate (with combat probe) and hunt Hulks, VNIs, Noctis or salvager, MTU or lost drones when I can't catch someone.  
---
I have less than 10k ehp so, I don't try Ishtar or Gila.
---
tfw Horde has more supers and titans than PL
---
Its a sandbox
---
This is a underrated post
---
I'm about to sell titan now that goons mine less and buy some plex.
---
I too am a spreadsheet warrior, but none of this actually matters unless it is on grid to use.
---
That makes more sense, one profile on each screen, need to look in to this and stop using 30 mins every day on adjusting my screens
---
oh look we have a special snowflake.... to you good sir/madam (or anything in between) i say HTFU!
---
Good luck!  Enjoy that bright yellow thing in the sky
---
This happened with KarmaFleet in Goons as well, it's kind of like, give the noobs the ability and resources to conquer their goals and conquer they will. The old time gates were prohibitively restrictive for new players, and for that reason, I'm super comfortable with the current state of the game.
---
Haha, for a second I though your post was about a stratios, and I couldn't figure out why the 4/10 would rep to much. But yeah, I had the same experience with my astero. I personally use a MWD and just kite everything out.
---
I need I learn to make money to throw away like this lol
---
This is some nice shitposting. Sorry not sorry but this is such a dumb thing to ask. If you are spending that much you should already be knowing what you are doing. And no one is gonna give up on potential profit on helping other traders enter a lucrative market.
---
Just like to say this is one pilots opinion and does not reflect the values or opinions of Razor Alliance.  Don't hate fellow players for playing the game.  Cloaky camping is an issue because the only counter is being able to form larger then the drop.  However pretty much every alliance has to deal with it.  I would love cloaky camping being more active and less afk.
---
Too bad they couldnt keep your frozen, lmao.
---
I can see both of the posts, maybe reddit freaked out on you or something
---
you know... that broker fee
---
It’s impressive what a solo player can still do with a ton of isk
---
So you think it's ok to use selective hate speech to trigger a selected audience of your choosing? And by me not tolerating it I'm a snowflake?
---
S E X  
---
Ok, now I have your attention.

Gonna use those 5b to pay for my student loans. You know, eve university and stuff.
---
Jokes aside, o7 dude. Enjoy life.
---
if(a) then(b) is true when not a OR B is true.
---
So the opposite of (a=&gt; b) is (a and not B) , ie first door is safe and second is deadly.
---
I don't know you but thanks for your story! Crazy to think of this all being possible starting in 2015.
---
absolutely
---
words are wind
---
They're viewable through a direct link, but not on /r/eve itself
---
Actually people who don't want to give up pve for pvp are dying...
---
u do know this reddit thread is ran by nc. right? it comes with the territory goons win in game they win reddit
---
in https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/new/ ? 
---
posted them both 11 hours ago.
---
because if they dont get seen on new they are never going to make it to https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/
---
the GSM decided that CCP should delete all anti Goon posts
---
&gt; Bastion / tnt / lawn have their own fc too.
---
i just love how its the second time you write that in the singular, says quite a lot about them.
---
I'll scroll thru new and see if I can find them. I was saying by clicking the links you provided I was able to see them
---
Have a good one man. See you in one year
---
Ah, fair enough
---
The ratio of supers to titans for Deadco and Holy League is hilarious. You can really tell their numbers are boosted by a lot of ratting.
---
Wish i could upvote you twice ! The moment i realised it changed so much things in my relatiknship to this game
---
Op is a large bundle of sticks and covered in sodium chloride.
---
Recommend that you try and get some antialiasing up in those images. Your text has the jaggies.
---
To you maybe, but there are quite a few people out there that may be the target of such words. To them the words are representative of many other things. I would say using hate speech or slurs is just the lazy way of you guys getting on your opponents nerves. I know alot of you are creative  and can figure you a different way. spreading hate in such a way is wrong
---
Good luck out there. Real sec can be scary.
---
Some turbo-autists like myself don't use alts. My main is my titan pilot, so I guess I count. Don't get me wrong it's also my super, dread, carrier, omni-subcap, ratting, and mining tooniè.
---
Should've been the first one. However they were not all at the same place at the time so might be more to be fair.
---
I submitted a pro goon post that was doing good, then it was removed. So I assume it's just some admin that hates anything interesting to other people and deletes it.
---
I could really use that 5b to offset my stupidity
---
Rice is delicious. Just saying.
---
Sucks for you
---
You can't sustain a fight on a structure in Oneiros/Scimitars either because they can't transfer cap, so it's the same problem.  This meta is either the structure neuts you, or the other players do.  
---
Nobody in this game is sadder than me that the Lif is broken.  It was disgustingly good before people realized neuts were a thing.
---
yeah i was rushing it before heading off to work. first time i've used a clipping mask and i like the way it turned out in the second one. didn't get it to work correctly in the first one
---
this
---
got a link? i like all sorts of kinks. even you weird rock munchers
---
don't, it stopped being profitable when ccp made the rorqual changes, now everyone is building them just to liquidate the ore they mine and so there is pretty much little (if you have everything t2 rigged, low system cost index and max researched bpos) to no profit involved
---
Reddit is just racist against dickheads is all!
---
&gt;saying the groups "tolerate" each other is pretty laughable given that init is that close to snuff.
---
As I said, leadership gets along well.  SNUFF standards for corps and players is literally the floor when it comes to behavior beyond strict gameplay.  
---
The relationship with them is a net-positive but by no means would I want to be any closer to them than we already are.  
---
They might not be TISHU-level bad, but...Adversity...need I say more.  Tolerance is exactly the correct word.

Goons are the laughing stock of the game. Let them have this one, otherwise we'll get a PM saying don't go to r/eve tomorrow if you were nice to them.
---
They did rework the ewar a little bit. Web and warp scramble for example have a cooldown after every cycle, so they can´t hold you down forever, and if I´m not mistaken they removed the targeted neut bomb
---
which is worth about 5x your garbage coalition on a great day.
---
what how do you need isk and have isk to spare
---
r/eve mods are the true winners of the eve meta
---
Have you tried to talk to CCP to fix the problem. It is sad that hull like this is worthless
---
Good luck buddy.
---
What backstabbed allies are you talking about?
---
The fixes you got recommended are standard procedures that you could have tried as well if you googled for a minute. You were lazy/afraid to do something yourself, instead you bothered GMs and took their time from serious problems to solve your stupid issue. You could have gotten a bonus for logging in. Now you dont. Accusing CCP of being unfair to you is downright childish whining.
---
You're a fuckwit.
---
Just because people can inject doesn't mean they will and that in no way invalidates this information.
---
The holes in this data are already well known, it's based on KB info so it's not intending to be a complete picture or a projection it's literally just activity of Supercaps based on zkill data for the past three months.
---
If you don't think that's useful information...I hope you're in charge of strategic planning for my enemies.
---
i actually closed the 2 random whs and critted the c3 static just before we completly lost hole control, we weren't really expecting that good of a hole control (and we almost got in since beens decided not to care about the EOL ns connection 23 jumps from our staging which closed right before we got there) but oh well. The forts would have been within seconds apart but i had my orcas fitted wrong and had to use 1 instead of 4. I was in one of the nags and i just warped as close to you guys as possible which was outside of tether and just tried killing stuff til the end. There isn't really that much isk in there tbh, pretty much every single structure in that wh was funded by me and the 5 forts was just a #alreadyreplaced meme so that's why they were on the same grid, and we did get one online :P
---
There is other groups people look over, such as  [https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99006411/supers/](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99006411/supers/)

i don't always call inty pilots , retarded. but when i do i end up getting ganked by a jackdaw fleet 3 mins later in a shitfit lif.

Help me fund my eve addiction

i got my self a keepstar and got it dropped (since pubh The Mittani holds the keys to every keep in delve)

Yeah, see, you continue to show that you're yet another uninformed rager. Either that or just a boring troll.
---
who will you frame just after the sale?
---
[already did](https://imperium.news/the-imperium-tries-to-steal-braves-halloween-candy/) :P

Totally forgot they were there.. i think i was thinking about private contracts
---
fair enough. and the second one?
---
We need more "good sports" in this game.  I wish I was one of them.
---
o7 fly safe irl mate
---
Again, what allies?
---
Well at least they didn't unanchor them.
---
How is it a shitfit? It’s a bumping lif, all it does is bump something off of tether. Looks correctly fit to me.
---
Because when the good guys show up (Read: That's goons and INIT) to destroy a keepstar, its like that "on your left" moment in Endgame. If "Tanorth" brings the fight or runs matters little, its still going to be an epic moment to see all of us shoulder to shoulder.
---
that was me, i only logged in like once a week since then but was still working on a keepstar and the wh stuff, now i am trully done
---
lol, he actually informed the scout he was in the area cloaked?
---
sheesh, hope goons tortured him a bit first before finishing him off.
---
(also wtf kind of fit is that)
---
How long you gonna win Eve for?
---
sticks and stone may break your bones but you make words sound fucking fatal.
---
well, i got rid of my super fleet a long time ago and i don't really have that much time irl as i used to
---
That's the way to do it. Cloaky nullified T3 gives you scanning and hacking strength on par with a cov-ops, with the nullification of an interceptor. Only downside is warp speed, and speed when moving between cans that are really far apart.
---
\&gt; spending 1bil on a ship and then using T2 invuls
---
Message me if you're interested in FW... I can recommend both Gallente and Caldari corps
---
The "no need to log in consecutively to receive all items" horseshit should have been followed by "...but you must log in 16 of the 20 days."
---
Their ambiguity should favor the players. The fact that they did not specify the necessity to log in 16 of the 20 days would be legal grounds to find in favor of the players. 
---
"No need to log in consecutively" on it's face assumes that you could log in on the last day and all rewards would be received. 
---
Just another dick move by CCP. Another failure to lead and be transparent. More evidence that Iceland is nothing but amateurs with thick skulls being sustained with piss-water alcohol and fetid whale blubber.
---
The absolute state of INIT bantz.....
---
.... mom jokes.

Yikes lad!

it's an ok fit for bumping stuff off tether

---
Enough ISK for a fit, not enough to progress much in the game (considering how expendable ships are).
---
You should write about it on your Tumblr account, or take a knee at your next sporting event.
---
Spectre fleet for days!
---
&gt; Actually counting the days that I will be strong enough to move to null and fly (and explode) alongside him :)
---
just move to ns already, believe me, you can make more money salvaging after a super than mining in hs and there is plenty of those if you pick the right group. As for being able to fight? well, join fleets, die, file for srp and do it all over again, you'll learn eventually and you aren't going to lose much becouse of the srp
---
You're not too smart, are you? The whole idea with a bumping lif is that it's supposed to be disposable. Putting C-types on it or something is the exact opposite of disposable.
---
&gt; spending money on an expendable ship meant to bump ships in hostile space.
---
Brain, do you have one?
---
And mostly a reason to visit that System more often
---
It’s literally a ship decided to die to get a bigger kill.
---
Who the fuck puts deadspace shit on a bumping fax.
---
i can’t read properly therefore, “waaaaaa ccp u suckz”
---
You'll be back.

"this mach in uemon doesn't even have guns lmao"
---
Giving away free ISK... 30% downvoted.  You can't please anyone in this sub.
---
I mean, if NC. actually balls up and fights, I fully expect the price to go up as the amount of spare hulls laying about are finite.
---
You think Darkness has only got 9 titans? We've got at least 10 if everyone resubs.
---
I totally agree, it just doesnt make sense to warp after warp for 30 minutes just to arrive in a extremely laggy 5k player system and die without doing much.
---
i gave out a titan, like 6 supers, shitloads of caps, probably like 400-500b in structures over my time in eve, let the pubbies have 5b :P
---
You literally had extra time. How in the absolute hell are people complaining *still*? I missed like 2 days, but still found 3 minutes a day to load the client and hit redeem, even with my busy schedule.
---
Your laziness to even try and attempt to fix your own problem is just that - your problem. CCP doesn't OWE you or any of us SP or gifts, they did it to celebrate, and handed out what is assumed to be enough contingency time just incase you aren't near your computer for a few days. The fact that you were reliant exclusively on a ticket based support system, and not doing any problem solving of your own is absolute laziness. And you come in to r/eve now entitled to those points?
---
GTFO mate...
---
Some of us have manners.
---
Redalert, you have been falsely pushing the goons are botters narrative for a long time, and have been proven wrong by CCP. Time to give it up brav.
---
good luck with whatever you are about to do 
---
dont you think you will regret this at some point?
---
I have a few friends who are starting to play casually so I recently joined after years of reading about the drama and how crazy the game can get sometimes. So far I have been solo and have enjoyed it as a side-game. I think that if I wanted to really get stuff done I will need to either join a corp or get a large enough squad of friends to make stuff happen.
---
Long time? Lmao
---
I've never claimed "goons are botters"
---
I've seen opinionated standing fleet heroes enough in my time to recognize them
---
By the way Dunk if you're reading, you should bring a nano gang around some time
---
Do better next time. 
---
That was quite embarrassing!
---
How far can you guys retreat before you run out of space?
---
Upvoted due to the last comment, and I *partially* agree with you, but anyone wanting to test this theory would have logged in on like, Day 3, and wondered why they couldn't get rewards from Days 1 and 2, no?
---
Thats what the doctors told your mom
---
zydrine /s
---
TIL Panfam doesn't include horde
---
We never quit, we just log off for progressively longer each time.
---
can't tell you much because of the NDA but it looks awesome, has a great potential and the devs are keeping up with their time line so far
---
Even when I kill Brave standing with blaster frigates and then leave when 20 guys arrive, I still get shit in local and direct convos for "being a pussy"
---
Hehe ok
---
&gt; You just be quiet and go to unanchor something else.
---
OMG i just spit my coffee. So true
---
This +1000
---
Etherium was one of the last true freelands of the game. No renters, no botters, just small groups who where on their own.
---
Even with SkillU stoping their eviction on the west border, -cause they are cool guys and, nothing is gain is smashing littlegrops- with UnSpoken, L A S E R H A W K S and JaG leaving, Veracruz sure will leave too. Funny thing, that the guys who cry about megablops, chestbeat them self about beating independent groups. Truth is, NCPL will not fight anyone that can shoot them back. 
---
Outcome? A Lot of that groups will eventualy make imperium bigger. So, more tears will come and "Eve is dead" posts. 
---
Wish you best of luck in whatever is your new proyect 07
---
Honestly, these "log in every day" events are utter bullshit.  I have a job and three teenage kids.  Sometimes I log in every day in a week, sometimes I have too many commitments.
---
You're going to "celebrate your anniversary" by falsely pumping up your daily unique connection numbers by forcing people to long in every single day.
---
How about a celebration *just be a celebration* and you give away all the loot to anyone who logs in this month?
---
firesales and building caps, ccp broke both
---
If you are looking for someone to pickup your soap, go to r/cleanprison
---
Let's see, they haven't blued half the game. In fact, they have less blues than when the Casino War started, and they were outnumbered then. The North literally shot itself in the foot over the past few years since then. They backstabbed all of their allies to the point where now they ARE outnumbered by GSF and friends. It is their own doing.
---
Quit being such a bitch all the time, it is the fault of PANFAM that The Imperium is as powerful as it is.
---
Yes, though with the wardec changes you may as well make yourself a 1 man corp and avoid the taxes.
---
nah, having everything is fun, until it isn't. i'd much rather start from 0 if i ever come back
---
wow you're sure dedicated to preserving history lmao
---
 **¯\\\_\(ツ\)\_/¯**
---
TEST, GOTG/Deadco for starters. Seriously, get a clue dude.
---
\&gt; rapid  
---
it's not like it hasn't been seen coming for like, oh, coming up on 3 years?
---
I bet if we magically suddenly could run 10 000 pilots in one system with zero tidi, then it would be worse. Because its about 14 doomsday per hour per titan (15 with rapid fire V). If its 500 vs 500 titans and each titan needs 50 DDs to die then about 100 titans die in the first hour. Per side. If we assume 65bn price per titan including implants, then your coalition at 10% tax would need people to rat 65 trillion isk to have one hour of titan SRP. ONE HOUR of titan fun. 
---
Not counting the ratting and refining tax and manufacturing tax and market tax needed to pay for fuel on structures for that alliance. 
---
Meanwhile as is right now, we would need to go 10 hours to have the possibility of losing 100 titans per side, and even then due to server call lag and coordination inefficiencies, we only see 40% of that at most per side. So the tidi makes these once a year battles cheap enough for us to actually DO them once a year :P
---
&gt;Let's see, they haven't blued half the game. In fact, they have less blues than when the Casino War started,
---
Thats what forcing you allies to merge with you does.
---
&gt;hey backstabbed all of their allies to the point where now they ARE outnumbered by GSF and friends.
---
what allies? talking about test? co2? MBC was designed to reset eachother when WWB was done
---
&gt;Quit being such a bitch all the time, it is the fault of PANFAM that The Imperium is as powerful as it is.
---
This narrative is fucking retarded. Its goons fault that Imperium is as powerfull as they are because they adapted to the meta better.
---
It's sad that your post has more excitement in it than my entire EVE career.
---
Funny penif well done.
---
As good as the Game of Thrones finale?
---
I just checked DOTLAN. I see no sov timers in Delve. Guess goons put out the fire already.
---
One more
---
Bringing solo back
---
I would focus looking for general PVP experience and situational awareness. As well as small gang warefare.
---
So look for a lowclass wormhole corp. or a newbie corp. idk if spoopy newbies is still a thing. But if they are check em out I guess.
---
awesome, tell that to /u/Mondschweif when he makes another coalition list
---
Let me quote the guy I was responding to : "the NC super/titan blobs on previous BR' . Demonstrated that we didn't deploy supers.
---
I know reading is hard, but come on.
---
Penif can't be king, he has no balls!
---
3 years same number of members, titan and super carrier numbers quintupled compared to the 7 years prior.
---
Injectors are the basis of eves problems imo
---
6% 'Prospector' implants are worth the cost if you are running in an interceptor IMO. Along with 'Blackglass' obviously.
---
You do realize that it's a satire site.
---
Didn't read mad to me.
---
Could you shoot me a couple bill? I need to buy me my first rorq and the damn skill book :(
---
&gt;TEST
---
No, just no. Working together for a while because of mutual strategic interests isnt being allies, or do you mean snuff and imperium are allies?  PANFAM consists of Horde, NC and PL, and only those. 
---
&gt; GOTG/Deadco
---
No, Horde decided to reset GOTG, NC/PL was pretty clear on staying out of it. When NC/PL have formed for large timers, horde have been there, not GOTG, of course you pick the ones that show up. 
---
Also GOTG made a peace deal with panfams enemy without consulting with them first.
---
Not sure you can call it a "deployment" to your own botting empire. More like moved a couple ships down there.
---
RIP. lol. Well at least a partial of the comment is true. It sucked when he stopped doing vids lol.
---
there is no honor in cowardice.
---
You are a moron.
---
when i was building caps, carriers were 1,6b, rorqs 2,4b, supers 24b
---
now it's more like carriers - 800m, rorqs - 1b supers 13b. In many cases that isn't even worth the ore you need to build it since people that build those make profit from mining and this is just how they liquidate that isk
---
Na+Cl-Na+Cl-Na+Cl-
---
Na+Cl-{|||||||} Na+Cl-
---
a defensive deployment is still a deployment, not sure what your point is
---
Every one of those you kill isnt deployed, is a filthy krabber and have zero impact on our ability to knock your sand castle down. But keep telling yourself that killing that ratting super or mining rorqual is important if it helps you sleep at night. 
---
Hell if anything you are helping our economy because everytime a ratting super dies they put in an order to our builders for a new one.   Ask Jay.
---
\&gt;spending anything on a hull designed to bump a ship then die
---
What if I told you that CCP doesn’t own all the network infrastructure between their server and every one of their players?
---
Wow f1 goon wants to be smart while having no idea about this game outside of ratting/mining/f1
---
No clue. But at the current speed of your invasion we should be good for the next couple of years.
---
my favorite part was probably dying in the titan tbh. as to where i'd start if i came bac, no clue, depends on where PA decides to take EVE
---
That's actually a pretty good way to look at it.
---
You know how I know you’re an idiot?
---
You think in 2019 /r/eve is creative, when their most common insult is “show me on the X where Y touched you”.
---
Half of the eve player base is openly racist so. Take that for what it is.
---
You can check out any time you like... but you can never leave...
---
enjoy your hiatus ;)
---
Do you have another game to move on to or is this a victory for RL (Not Rocket League) ?
---
possibly, not sure but so far the zkill list didn't update
---
Ill do one better, send me 400 and ill send 0 back!
---
This isn't what I meant! 
---
Try something... creative and original!
---
strategic self-mutilation\*
---
horde is in delve? don't they have their own anoms?
---
lol you fucked up, didn't get free stuff, wasted GM time, and now you want support?
---
poor panfam, they have fallen to the depths of r/eve for approval
---
but its safer in delve
---
Why are you quitting?  Was it that you Just had enough, and saw all that there was to see?  Did you feel at any point like you "won" or beat the game?   Do you think you'll ever return to EVE?  What features would most likely make you come back, if implemented?
---
Doot
---
So me asking you to be creative is also me thinking that your original comment it creative and I'm actually just asking for more? Please read more carefully next time the periods between words is where I started a new sentence.
---
At least you went out in style!
---
Frankly guys, it doesn't really matter that this chart doesn't reflect the ships everyone has docked, because the fact that Goons can afford to lose that many supers/titans in comparison to everyone else means they are flush against all you space poors.
---
What's tumblr used for, please explain most knowledgeable one.
---
by SP i do. was faster to get one of my dread pilots into the requisite fleet ships then it was to get them into the titan that my main was just missin dd skills for.
---
lol, updoot is deserved for that self-deprecating sense of humor \^\^
---
Ahhhhhh. Here we have a wild OP who thinks restricting free speech isn’t gonna be used on your gay cunt first.
---
It’s fucking cute how naive it is. 
---
Look OP. Hate speech is just speech you disagree with. And you can disagree with it all you want. That’s your fucking right.
---
But don’t fucking cry to me, when the people you praise for restricting speech uses it against your fucking hate speech (aka anything I disagree with). 
---
CCP is teaching you a life lesson. Telling people what they can and cannot say is fucking stupid. It’s a slippery slope. And it can easily be turned against you. 
---
So fuck off you idiot. CCP isn’t gonna read this, and it isn’t gonna read any fucking logs. It’s just gonna straight ban you no questions asked.
---
gotta say tho, the "noob" corps are usually the more fun ones to be in / fight, as they are more open and flexible (kitchensink or just goodfights)
---
This is also true, I have also learned more about the game living in these corps than I have off in other corps that dont have a good training infrastructure. It's a win-win.
---
Go do incursions with WTM
---
Thanks but no thanks.
---
Not that I don't believe you, I know that NS is way more lucrative than HS but, in one of my previous attempts to EVE, I rushed to Braves. Did the tutorial missions, went through SEO epic arc and moved to null (to catch at the time).  
---
And I burned out. Not enough skills to have fun, not enough ISK to replace my losses, even when some of the losses were replaced with the SRP.  
---
My very basic knowledge of the game made me a sitting duck in space :)  
---
This time I want to have more SPs before moving to null (it's a pain to only be able to barely fly frigs and not really know what to do when you try to join a roam/fleet), the ISK hoarding (while slowly) is just a consequence of having something to do while the training goes.  
---
I'm in a player corp and they are a good bunch, helpful and all, and for the time being, while I assimilate more of the game and its ships/modules/fits/skills, I'm very happy dual boxing a porpoise+covetor, moon mining and all, while watching twitch :)  
---
According to my plan, I should join null by the end of the summer, at that time I will be able to fly a VNI (22 day left! thanks to the 1.25mil free SP hurray) and a Gila to do Abyssals 3+ ... actually any Cruiser of any race. I won't be specialised on them, but at least I will be able to experiment ships and fits, and blow stuff up (and of course, be blown to pieces).  
---
Thanks for the input tho :)
---
Thats a lot of words to say you haven't killed any supers or titans this deployment.
---
Idk what to tell you man.
---
Hate speech is just speech I don’t agree with.
---
You’re an idiot if you think it’s not gonna be used against you.
---
And you’re especially special if you think CCP is going to read the logs. Especially after the whole BRIXCS debacle.
---
Remember, this is just folks that got on a kill in the past 3, relatively quiet, months.
---
What do you expect from panfam? Do the vocal people on reddit speak for everyone in said coalitions/alliances!? It's all propaganda, your comments included :)
---
cool thanks - yet to ever fly through a wormhole - might try it
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee o/
---
yes how could i forget - bsb!
---
These are numbers that were used, or else they would not have appeared on Zkill. My super and titan for instance would not be counted,as they have not gotten kills in past 3 months.
---
I kept getting kicked from a private server in another game for saying "back pedal" (which is English slang for like reverse your course) Someone later told me it was a homophobic slur for some central European country.
---
Thing is, I didnt even log out. I actually died to his fellow alliance mate.
---
open console (or terminal in win) and run:
---
ping 8.8.8.8 
---
keep it running for some time, pay attention on a last number in each row.
---
The less number is it is the better, usually upto 30ms should be fine for playing
---

---
Read this one. way better explained and it even has images!
---
You make the drekavac look even hotter. Thank you kindly for sharing this
---
One day I will go ahead and burn everything to the ground.
---
fake news. delb is on firb.
---
i mean, there's lots of problems. i don't disagree with you that proliferation is a problem. in fact, it has been a problem for many years, just in a different way.
---
can deadspace structures or npcs be cargo scanned
---
So in other words: buying and reprocessing caps is a valid way to make isk? ;(
---
No, but you must be.
---
Mate, rice is epic.
---
It should be so that more than 5 ecm drones nerfs the jamming power of the 6th, 7th, 8th... etc. drone.
---
Something about how their jamming signals get mixed up and they are no longer able to pinpoint the target.
---
I feel like most ppl with skill-farms have a maxed out account to go with it.
---
So they actually can make isk with dreads or carriers or someshit to subsidize the cost.
---
You should spend less time reading sperge on reddit.
---
This is a super/titan list, not Muninn list.
---
Plex and injectors my dude, long term looks good, short term looks good.
---
Yeap
---
I don't know what to tell you either, you're saying you dont agree with it but you'd rather just look past it because you don't feel like CCP would do anything about it anyways? That's a silly way to look at things. Also this whole post was about how I got reported for someone else using hate speech in case your getting a little off track.
---
The only thing that ISRAD hates more than girls is goons
---
Ah, yes, the old adage of making your reps higher than their deps.  Nice escape!
---
I thought I was done, 3 years later and I'm back. see you in space in 2022
---
I mean, CCPs numbers are right there for you to look at. Or is it that you are illiterate? If that is the case, I apologise and will stop calling out your stupidity on the matter.
---
It's better than being a botter.
---
No don't sink that much isk into a titan BPO, it takes AGES to break even. 
---
What group you in? If goonswarm (and test I think) you can set up large scale manufacturing and reactions that you ship to market via alliance services (20-40% return on investment each cycle, easy), because we have tons of public structures for everything an empire needs. 
---
In NCdot or anywhere else AFAIK you'd have to rent a system and then pay to put up your own structures to do this manufacturing in (though I guess you could theoretically tax those structures to recoup some of that investment quicker).
---
Put your DDAs back on and loot a meta scram from a rat
---
Well I’ve only encountered drifter holes from 0.0 beacons. So Sansha holes might exist. I still haven’t seen it all TBQHF.
---
You will be missed mate. 
---
Pshtz is recruiting if you ever come back.
---
And what does those numbers show? Without year by year stats they are worthless. B0t for one, have been owned by multiple entities over the years, without knowing when the bans happened you can't really pin them to a coalition. 
---
Greater Western etc is owned by Goons and have a far shorter and smaller history of renting, still on the chart.   
---
I know you want to take this numbers and say GRR PANFAM, but you can't without literally diving into the most retarded narrative there is.
---
Not as well as lquid
---
This is redundant. If your scan window is open as you jump it automatically V-scans fambalam.
---
after srp &amp; insurance u retards are actually putting isk into penif's wallet
---
tfw a 16k alliance have more than a 2k alliance?
---
I remember seeing a great one that was just a pair of floating eyeballs on a black background. Nice little bug in the character creator!
---
What made you want to quit? Personally stopped playing several months ago because of the participation grind in goons made it not fun. It wasn't necessarily a grind either, just got tired of doing fleets for hours and nothing happening.
---
Maybe video game chat activism isnt the best idea for you.
---
" What happened with your super fleet? "  Stuck in asset safety after they unanchored the keep it was in?
---
i have 4 100% Indy toons in NC. that haven't been online since december, your intel is a bit off. 
---
There are 2 corps that i know have a no pvp in main corp rule, but thats pretty much it
---
What do you do when you're flying your subcap and they are pinging for titans? No titan content for you i guess
---
Why do you say that
---
After my wife died in 2008, penif would bring it up every chance he got. I'd already been contemplating suicide, but the last fucking thing I was going to do was let that shit stain drive me to an early grave. Instead, I left the game for a while. He hasn't changed a bit, I see.

u/stainguy does everything he can to make it look like panfam is the big bad guy that supports botters while goons are the good anti botter alliance, its one of the most retarded narratives there have been
---
Well, anyone has a guide on how to use isk/hr to find what blueprints are profitable?
---
Here's to hoping. Would be nice to get a rebound since ccp just screwed me (and many more out of the last anniversary bonus). I promise to spend most of it on exotic dancers.
---
lol ccp data show this.      
---
Your narrative is "NC did nothing wrong, CCP fabricated those values and they actually prove nothing."
---
They're gonna piss off a lot of people with their mass email response. See Below:

**Senior GM Archduke** (EVE Online)

May 21, 12:43 UTC
---
Thank you for contacting the Player Experience Team. This is a mass reply to all players who submitted tickets concerning the [XVI Anniversary event](https://www.eveonline.com/article/pqvk05/xvi-anniversary-join-the-celebrations).
---
* The campaign was live from the 2nd of May till the 20th of May 2019. giving players 18 days to claim a total of 16 rewards.
---
* The Anniversary rewards were available to be claimed until the downtime (11:00 EVE time) on the 20th of May 2019. as advertised and as per the intended game mechanics. This was shown by a countdown in the "XVI Anniversary Celebration" window, counting down first the days and then the hours left from the campaign. \*The Day 1 reward was the first an account could claim, regardless of which day of the event they claimed it on. They could then claim the 2nd reward the day after, and so on.
---
* If an Alpha account would upgrade to Omega at any time during the event, they would receive all Omega rewards for the previously claimed days upon their next claim (they would also get a new claim button upon opening the event window, if that was on a day where they already claimed the rewards)
---
We can regretfully not make any exceptions to these rules, and can as such unfortunately not assist you in this case. That being said, I understand that this time-frame may have been too short for some of our players, and I hope that we can further improve our events in the future. We would appreciate your feedback regarding this – I would encourage you to consider posting your thoughts about this on the EVE Online forums in the [Event Feedback - XVI Anniversary Celebrations!](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/event-feedback-xvi-anniversary-celebrations/156410) thread, or to highlight your concerns to the CSM.

Wait what
---
I have won Eve for 5 years until I decided to give it a try again last month. Decided to stay.
---
He's subverting your expectations
---
Exactly.
---
I’m saving hate speech is a fucking joke dude.
---
To me, anyone who argues that we should report each other for hate speech is hate speech. 
---
Because it’s fundamentally against free speech. To be able to report others for their speech.
---
Ontop of that. To get political. The argument the dirty stupid republicans use is that Once a country (or entity like CCP) starts managing speech. It will first use it against its own special snowflakes that wanted it to!!!
---
And what you’re telling me. Right fucking now is that this new form of reporting people for “hate speech” has been used against a vocal opponent of “hate speech”.
---
So yeah. According to your example the conservatives were right. If you restrict speech (Even if it’s in order to protect minorities and cunts) it will first be used against people like you, who complain about this shit because they complain. Then it will be used politically offensively against everyone else.
---
Hate speech is a joke because it’s just an excuse to govern what people say. And it’s defined so loosely that it was used against your SJW ass before me, who pretty much openly hates everyone.
---
Yeah okay retard
---
Yeah fly thru E-O usually led to such a fate
---
no it's true
---
Lmao. How retarded are you.
---
Its not NC.'s job to ban botters, just like its not Mittens job to do it. No alliance supports botting, as it won't bring more profit than having real players.
---
A bot doesn't invest in the local market
---
A bot in your corp can lead to a wiped corp wallet
---
A botting corp in your renter alliance can lead to a wiped alliance wallet 
---
As said to you about 100 times, i have never said NC. is the good guys, nor that goons are the bad guys. Its you that is trying to sperg a retarded narrative about sides in this. 
---
Your problem is not understanding statistics. I would recommend taking a math class or something because this is fucking embarrassing.
---
I haven't seen a definite counter-example yet and I do a lot of exploration.
---
Fly safe Traveller o7
---
I hope you don't biomass, just in case
---
Warp to Me is good for beginners and has alpha capable ships. I have a Rokh I'm planning to fly with them on an alpha alt. 
---
Some null-sec alliances also have Incursion sigs which are usually newbie friendly. In goons they allow a few newbie cruisers per fleet which don't take many skills at all. I'd assume other null blocs have this as well but I wouldn't quote me on that part since I haven't been part of them.
---
Anyways, welcome to Incursions, and be prepared to be ROLLING in isk.
---
Oh nice! I heard of that one! Is it actually in a nice enough state to play now?
---
Except he isn't in INIT and you got flair baited. He's a shitlord of the north embarrassed by his own flair.
---
&gt; oppressive ewar of citadels
---
It is pretty useless now, so ya, CCP did nerf it into oblivion.
---
POS EWAR is far far far far far more oppressive.
---
Sorry its borderline impossible to seperate his posting from actual INIT posting.
---
Keep in mind that CCP added w-space systems, so both numbers are probably correct for the time they were published.
---
You had two spare days and events in Eve always work like this. People are always going to reee about not getting enough free stuff, but why did you miss three days in the event?
---
Invest in me. I’ll do a collateral backed loan for like 50b. Repay in a few months with interest. Lmk
---
What is this fax fit for? (serious question)
---
Hate to see you go! It was fun and hope to see ya soon!
---
Ahh , nice gj dude
---
You were probably literally remembering wrong since I've never had the rule of six be wrong in my experience of hacking hundreds of relic sites. 
---
Here it goes: 
---
1: If you have a node connected to 6 other nodes it should be save to land on EXCEPT WHEN
---
2: The system core is right next to it
---
So to paraphrase a node connected to six other nodes should never have a defense thingy on it except when the system core is in one of those 6 connected adjacent nodes.
---
I take it your name is based on "things to do" but not yet accomplished?
---
Sansha holes are normal C4s though from the perspective of region and class.
---
It is not, in fact, consecutive.  [Definition of consecutive](https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=consecutive)
---
It's called a daily login campaign, which kinda implies that you log in daily.  While yes I think it's stupid, they could be doing worse things with their time.
---
PS: Legal threats (and I'm stretching this to include yours) are absolute top tier salt :popcorn:
---
And living in delve! Lol
---
And here you go proving my point... 
---
INITposting smh
---
*fires BFG*
---
"STOP OR I'LL SHOOT!"
---
Reading comprehension next on your list of things to do I see.
---
Looks like a bump fax for me.
---
I mean.. you could restate what you are asking into "how dare you not log on every single day", but in the same breath.. he is complaining about said event.. so it's a wash.
---
afaik yes, there used to be some semi-exploits based on the fact that that was possible - [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1aq9tv/free_tip_for_explorers_out_there/) maybe?
---
Just my two cents - my 35th birthday was over the course of the event. As I wanted the skill points I had to bring my work laptop to an air BNB and log in everyday. I wish they had a bit of flexibility when the events are so long. Should just be 16 log ins during the entire month. For weekend events, I get the strictness though. That being said I did everything I could to log in and claim my rewards.
---
I feel there's a meta-joke about the irony of not following simple rules to claim these rewards, kinda akin to those scams based on an obscure ruleset tailored to make you fail.
---
Except this is not a scam and the rules were fairly simple.
---
The invasion patch is releasing in seven days. Have Triglavian Invasions been available for player testing on SiSi at any point yet?
---
It's rare for supercaps to be called in as reinforcements after fleets have already left, so that doesn't happen too often. More commonly the titans are pinged first, with supporting subcap fleets after that.
---
\#cows
---
All games with daily login rewards are trash and you should not play them fyi
---
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9K6D3zDOis) you go
---
Hey! I made onion news
---
Says from the guys who unanchor Even planets if they can and blops over 200 people alliance who foght even outnumbered and outgunned.
---
yup, [DU](https://www.dualthegame.com/en/)
---
I have had this rule fail two or three times, where a node surrounded by six other nodes without being adjacent to the system core contained a "defense thingy".
---
This isn't to say the Rule of 6 isn't the case, it's just that there's a small chance that whatever system generates the puzzle grid can occasionally fuck up in \~&lt;0.1% of cases.
---
It's not really all that big a deal, though.
---
I do this quite a lot against roaming ships, but I'm not prepared to fight a potential cyno on something larger than a frigate. I've killed quite a few frigate cynos but against a Tengu there's a good chance I lose a VNI and part of the troll is denying all possible kills.
---
Actual humor appears to be on yours!
---
They just shouldn't have done a daily login event that was as stupid as this one anyways. Daily login garbage is the sort of thing you find in a P2W F2P game, not EVE Online.
---
I refuse to believe it without video evidence TBH :P Lit. have been hacking for 4 years as my main income and made tens of billions of ISK. It's probably that your brain interpreted the grid layout wrong or something distracted you.
---
Maybe, maybe not. Shit week in the real world. I'll bring a better round of back and forth neener neener next time so we can fling more imaginary mud.
---
are34 was fun to fly with, but alas he won eve.
---
So I'm to understand that this is by character, not by kills? I would be curious to see not just who has the most supers, but who is using them the most.
---
no since you only get like 60% back at best
---
Why not join a corp? I love getting people like you more involved in the game, there's not a huge time sink inherent to being in a corp or alliance.
---
Pay attention to Jita local, you find the best deals there from honest businessmen.
---
What a save!
---
Don't forget they cheast beating for extra points
---
No, it just disproves your narrative that goons are full of botters. Rental alliances are havens for botters according to the chart, and GSF has rarely had rental Alliances. PANFAM, on the other hand, has owned/operated rental space since at least 2010 in some way or another.
---
What made you decide to "win" EVE?
---
&gt; Who wants half of your MER?
---
Like those people won't PLEX-whale for a titan the next day
---
I've never had a narrative that "goons are full of botters" 
---
Its not profitable for renter alliances to have bots amongst their ranks, it is easier to get away with though since there are less control
---
in imperium we have pretty much everything under full srp, in case of logi it's often twice the ship's worth, it all depends on where you go. As for being lost in ns, yes, been there too, [this](https://github.com/bperian/vintel) helps a lot with getting to know the region and that makes everything easier
---
See topic named hubris.jpg
---
Expected penif thread
---
Leaving extremely satisfied
---
So where to next? I’m gonna miss talking to Emrod and the crew during ustz
---
see now I think your getting a little of track my local conspiracy nut. again this whole post was how I got a warning for something I didn't do...now that we are back on track lets talk about hate speech in how it originated. Also please before we get started if you have any questions please feel free to ask. and as a last point if you're so passionate about it why cant there be change. The words that can be used aren't a problem but its the fact that they are used against people as a whole if you really dislike someone and wanna be vocal about it that's fine. When you used words to describe hate for people as a whole that's just lazy, its not the rest of them your mad at
---
when you expect 1 or 2 destroyers and find 10 titans and 20 supers
---
Warp to Me will still require you to fly mostly T2 modules, so there's some skilling up for you to do even if you do go as an alpha.
---
there is a lot of features missing but it's already playable (there are still some major bugs but it is an alpha, not early access and the devs are keeping up with their timeline so far)
---
Options:
---
1. Join a huge nullsec alliance. Karmafleet or Horde mainly. You're just a cog and no one will notice if you show or don't or when you do. Stuff is likely happening around the clock anyway.
---
2. FW, it's cyclical but tons of solo / small gang stuff is available. LPs make it self sustaining for dessies/cruisers down. Frig fights are very short and frigs are agile so they are more blob tolerant (you can usually bail/avoid/kill before blob lands.)
---
3. Abyssal, it's mostly a solo activity.
---
4. Exploration (decent way to fund stuff solo with low-ish skills.)
---
5. NPSI fleets when timing works out.
---
can't, busy ass fucking your dad right now thanks though
---
This response shows everyone that you haven't a clue about the political stage. You should honestly just shut up.
---
PANFAM decided to stop showing up to help their ally, resulting in the aforementioned peace deal that was actually offered to Killah Bee before Sort, so to say it was done without consulting is a lie.
---
As far as TEST goes, they were allies. They were blue to each other, and following the Casino War PANFAM decided they needed more room for their botting empire so evicted TEST and CO2.
---
A treaty with PANFAM isn't worth the paper it is written on, pure and simple.
---
The numbers tell you how many nodes away a GOOD node is. Good means either a bonus tool node or a hidden yellow sphere node that may be a bonus tool or a defense node so only open those in case you have no other options.
---
u won, dont biomass ur toon tho! maybe one day ul get bored and ul fly with us again o/
---
no, he still used the fucking word dip shit, bleeping out letters after you swear doesn't mean you didn't swear...
---
Oh yeah I guess that makes sense. Very interesting

It’s a cloak trick, you are visible for just a flash and are already flying out of the bubble at 2k/s by the time the dictor is chasing you.

Penif is still a better pilot than anyone in goons.

I'll take things that never happened for 500 Alex.
---
I was kinda kidding.
---
Ah it can work, as a 2 week to month old character i started a wormhole corp with 2 newb buddies. 
---
We recruited some newbs and some older characters and ran shitty low skill doctrines and after a couple years made it up to C5.
---
That said, we had 3 active people to start with.
---
Any details about planned releasedate?
---
posting for possible isk
---
Good riddance.
---
That does actually sound quite doable, add stront for reinforment requirements ala. POS system, and do the current vuln system.
---
Put jump clone in NPC null stations. Or any of the freeported raider stations.

You really think it's retarded to shoot hostiles? Reaching new levels of wut on reddit.
---
Facebook is just a scam of a platform, your not missing much
---
yes doing jack shit during a fleet is often boring, have you tried being useful ?
---
easy tiger, this isn't 5th grade anymore. you can use adult words.
---
Worth the wait, totally!
---
Nah dude, you're just dense af.
---
Always hate seeing people leave the game, even for someone I don't know. Good luck mate.
---
It's literally all the Lif can do now so v0v
---
no shit, hence me wondering why he would swear, then star out half the world shit, like he's somehow not swearing
---
There are still bad guys in space that need killing dude...
---
The permafrost event was total zen for me, I did it in a Astero with stable active rep plus AB, I just orbited and hacked while my drones killed the rats.
---
Only thing I thought to worry about was suicide, but I watched out groups coming in and no one ever scanned me.
---
Also hacking totally gets a bit better with a Frostline or Zeugma scanner &amp; a blackglass, load that all up in a Astero with a T2 emission scope sharpener, you are now in the hacking endgame.
---
5b when?
---
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
---
Early testing with the Lif when it was released by Mukk showed that the LIF made an excellent earth mover and was easily capable of driving larger capitals off of tether on structures due to the shape and size of the model.  None of the others are as good at it as this one is, hence Elowenn calling it a snow plow.
---
How is low sec DeD and rat payouts compared to null? 
---
Why not just go straight for null DeD sites or ratting if you’re already doing the cloaky T3?
---
you do have a point
---
Man, oddly enough you are one of the people i ended up missing the most....fucking stockholmed
---
Best of luck, and have fun in IRL.
---
I have two dads, which one?
---
What made you decide to quit out of curiosity?
---
Also put me in the raffle for the 5b please! I'm space poors :(

Congrats on winning eve.
---
Wow. you got a non-combat support ship with T3 combat ships... good job buddy! You are elite!
---
Y’all probably distracted him with a girl in local.  I know how y’all are!
---
take care buddy!
---
wtf is this
---
for people who don't want to click that link
---
Some pr the pieces, such as environmental effects, are there. The sites themselves weren't up last I checked, but that may have changed in the last few days. I'm kinda hoping we need to figure out the combat on Tranquility instead of Sisi myself though.
---
dont sign you're poasts
---
EVE mobile.
---
Don't bother with support tickets; ccp said get "stuffed"....
---
Both, we've formed what i like to call the Night Train, I'm the caboose.
---
It can happen, but it is rare. I remember hearing about a character name Pantie Snatcher or something similar go for several bill just because of the name. This was before alphas and injectors were a thing however, so it is probably less of a thing now as people can more easily "reserve" names with an alpha account.
---
o7 good luck with your new life

because people will feed like crazy then
---
Some items, such as BPs, can't be repacked. Skins probably fall into this category as CCP likely never anticipated them being un-packaged. Your best bet it to submit a ticket.
---
itll bite them in the ass metric wise when the event ends, not to mention the unsubs.
---
Well at least I didn't delete my comment so I got that going for me.
---
Eve with no supers and caps.
---
I think he's talking before that, Fred0 days when razor formed and could carry their weight.  They were a pretty good PvP alliance but the usual internal BS when he stopped playing, others took over and eventually they became a bloated carcass (one word... Bovril...) and now are not much more than a renter alliance hiding from universe.
---
You hold onto that.
---
Make sure you delete this one too. Thx for your service.

They can be great for day tripping, or just living in fro a couple of days before leaving to dump loot. Generally though this requires you to have seeded the hole in advance, as there are only 25 in the game and can be difficult to come by. This along with there only k-space static being a NS means they don't get huge amount of traffic, though they can be decent hunting if you want to live in one for a time. It also means that if anyone wants one there is a much larger chance they wind up in the hole you are in, as oppose to say hunting in a C3. WiNGSPAN offers a WH locator service for a fee if you are looking for one fast, though there are other options as well.
---
See you when you get back.
---
Hope you're well man.  Fly safe o7 (quiet)
---
clearly not.
---
You win

What's that thing next to the Pope-lady
---
It’s a known edge case, it’s just very rare. I’ve seen it as well once or twice
---
Don't know if this is a bit late, but I published a piece about hacking (and PI) today which has tips on the subject:  [https://ashyin.space/how-2-krab-hacking-pi/](https://ashyin.space/how-2-krab-hacking-pi/)
---
Maybe I'm just in the wrong... but wrong or not, I'm not registering my accounts for a few months. It's all I have to get back at them for this stupid event.
---
I have always used the list on Anoik.is. At the very least, it is a third source.
---
http://anoik.is/systems
---
I see nothing wrong here tbh.
---
You literally had to login an account to the character select screen once a day. It's less effort than even VNI ratting.
---
"Show me some pitty, I'll pay you."
---
just wait till enough nerds bitch about it, maybe contact kotaku or some other 'games' news outfit, and watch that sweet SP be awarded.
---
where's the fun in that?
---
Umm.. guns?
---
I just assume there is a Strat at the site all times, you just have to work fast and be ready to warp, and drop ec-300s and pray if you end up scramed.
---
I think it's been 4 years ago now, short only by a couple of weeks.
---
Reminds me of the two VNIs we caught in Provi a few days ago.  Both of them tackled.  We jump the hole, start burning the 3 jumps to get there.  I'm first to land on the first VNI.  It warps away.  Wtf?!?  Then the second warps away.  Fucking seriously?!?
---
Went home, rolled the hole, got a fight on a gate, only managed to kill the Phantasm, spent the next 10 minutes camped in the dead end system, bouncing the safes I'd made the last time I'd been camped in the system 5 months earlier, went home.
---
That was it for the night.
---
Hoping to get chosen, newish player here. I have played off and on but only trail accounts or free alpha characters. Never really spent more than a few days doing stuff. Would love to know what made you stick with the game so long that you were able to pretty much do everything.
---
Goons always there to cuck a bro
---
Today I leaned women are things.
---
&gt;This response shows everyone that you haven't a clue about the political stage. You should honestly just shut up.
---
Yes, you should. Did you start playing in 2018 or something? 
---
&gt;PANFAM decided to stop showing up to help their ally, resulting in the aforementioned peace deal that was actually offered to Killah Bee before Sort, so to say it was done without consulting is a lie.
---
Not relevant, Sort still did it without talking to his allies, KB got it offered to him but never discussed it with leadershi/sort. 
---
&gt;As far as TEST goes, they were allies. They were blue to each other, and following the Casino War PANFAM decided they needed more room for their botting empire so evicted TEST and CO2.
---
They were allied with the intention to evict goons, no more goons in the north, no more allies. 
---
&gt;A treaty with PANFAM isn't worth the paper it is written on, pure and simple.
---
Lmao stop embarrassing yourself.
---
In before the raffle
---
:(
---
Or how about they just don’t force us to do these shit dailies to boost their numbers. It’s not a gift; it’s a penalty that you pay if you don’t meet their objective since everyone else is getting it. (I got the reward on all of my accounts, before someone just says I’m salty bc I missed it.)
---
Thanks for the link, will probably use this, will have to do some web-scrapping to get all these systems into an Excel sheet for data tracking on my long journey.
---
You're not entitled to free stuff, if you can't do the event, your loss.
---
Or, it is a demonstration of someone else's success, in that the pilot who lost a ship was able to fly something they could afford to lose.  Some people just make sure they can afford more interesting explosions than others is all.
---

Please, you've only got mental gymnastics lvl 4. Get on my level.
---
Yeah, it's going to take a long time, but I plan to not burn myself out, maybe explore 10-20 holes a day or something, more if I want to. It's going to get really grindy near the end, but maybe Bob and RNG will shine on me.
---
there's a button on the character select screen that opens events...
---
where is the women on this pic
---
Looks cool but I'm not much of a consumer of mobile games.
---
Good luck in the real game.
---
wingspan is trash lol. keep sitting on highsec exits and popping 7 day old accounts around jita.
---
sincerely, a wormholer.
---
It was just an answer to the guy saying nc pl ph are not the same because they have their own fc ;D
---
Anyone have information on the income of a Sansha hope compared to a normal C4? 
---
Are there sleeper sites in them or just Sansha DEDs or what?
---
The relics and data, same thing?
---
Hey I’m in this photo
---
Thanks for the info, appreciate it.
---
Yeah but over 16 days - a lot of people plan trips or attended events. I was lucky the hotel I was staying at had internet (it was pretty out there int he wilderness) or I would havebeen screwed. Someone from my corp missed it because they had to fly to germany. If you are doing an event for 16 days, it should be a bit flexible encase someone is out of town for a single day they shouldnt lose the million...
---
still my beating heart
---
This, I don't play every day but I can turn on my pc and go as far as the loading screen np for these events. It takes a few minutes.
---
I plan on just jumping into the system as counting as "exploring" it. Basically just jump into every unique J-space system at least once.
---
got 15/16 on two accounts as well. That last day was pretty stupid. Kinda easy to make it right, especially with the apparent large group of pissed players. Gonna bite them in the ass when those accounts dont continue their subs.
---
This was the easiest event ever.  I followed the rules and got my rewards with two days to spare.
---
Lone player? Easy:
---
Exploration
---
PvE sites, both non scan and requiring scanning.
---
Lvl 4 security missions, or at least lvl 3.
---
Need to relax? Some mining in a safe spot lets you earn isk while otherwise occupied. 
---
Abyssal sites are another solo option.
---
If you want pvp, there are options for solo fun. Group stuff is still there, as NPSI fleets are still a thing. 
---
*There's lots to do as a solo player if that's your thing. Don't get forced into being part of something larger if you don't want that.*
---
Nope.  Offline mod = empty slot when it comes to heat accumulation.  But heat doesn't wrap around.  OP is in a Wolf, which has 5 slots.  If he put his guns in 1-2-3-4 with 5 empty, they would overheat faster than if he put them in 1-2-4-5 with 3 empty.
---
what about "IFFA COMPACT" thing?
---
An excellent question, one to which I do not have the answer.  I would presume he, and people in similar positions, attempt to create revenue streams based on their fans, such as through website ads and livestreams, but I've never looked into what the various Alliance heads actually do for a living.  If you ever do, let us know what you find, I'm sure much of r/eve would be interested.
---
Glad you had a good send off, fly safe in the real world and look for pings in that Corp you call a family o/
---
Probably gotta get hidden by mods, just so you know. Mine was. Bullshit.
---
some of the people have T2 BPCs
---
you never get that
---

hi, im a new player and joined a corp, im wondering if i should stay in high sec place where i started or join my corp in a null sec. im doing security missions right now to know how to pilot my ship better idk if going to null sec will benefit me since i just started. (dont want to get killed too much too early in the game)
---
thanks!
---
you are lying about STEP 5
---
That's a exotic dancer(male), you ain't fooling me

The nos is online :)
---
you wouldn't have gotten me say goodbye otherwise
---
You speak many words little newt, but can you walk the walk when the skies are filled with thousands of capitals on your docks? We shall see what your mettle is like, will you even undock your faction capitals this time or are you just all too scared?
---
I didn't see the NOS.  I'm bad.  And who are you?
---
Good luck winning Eve. Most of us don't make it.
---
No it got downvoted to oblivion
---
These comments though... Why can't you people not be toxic for 5 seconds?
---
Well shucks, such is life son.
---
"If you give people free stuff you should be flexible"
---
I have been getting varying degrees of packet loss at times when pinging Tranquility the last couple weeks. Reboot router, reconnect to Eve, no more problem. No trouble with anything else, streaming HD video just fine. Its weird.
---
Really?
---
You're mixing up CO2 (rip) with Goons
---
Maybe if we poked you in the eye you’d see clearer.
---
UA has the respect of PH. They undocked and fought well, even on the initial shield bashes.
---
It’s the Online community of EVE. You’d hope for a bit of a reasonable response, a better strategy is not to raise ones expectations too high.
---
Any corps that get plenty if both lossmails and killmails. Horde or Brave would the nullsec choice. Maybe someone else can recommend low sec and hisec options.
---
Once you get the basics of the game you need to start leading fleets. Horde will let anyone do it, and will have backseat fcs along to help. I suspect brave dies the same. Once you get the hang of it, start your corp.
---
Any corp that will let you whelp fleets and have experienced people to learn from is a good choice.

Is Hilmar's obsession with fucking mobile games?!

Congrats on winning EVE
---
Because it's much more intimidating when a thousand capital ships land in enemy territory. If you've seen the last war, the sheer numbers were absolutely scary and this time will probably be worse for the enemy. It's fun to watch PanFam shit themselves. :)
---
I'm in the alpha as well, just didn't have much time for it.
---
Sign should show 'AU' ;)
---
I had some Jewish friends once, supposedly they are pretty serious about using the Lords name in vain but it’s common place for them to use “G-d” or “Gd” to reference God without actually using his name in vain. 
---
So I guess some people have a personal preference on how they like to use words, and bottom line is that’s their prerogative.
---
First of many
---
This is not the EVE 2 we were asking for..
---
You even think that matters? "Looks mum, we killed a tiny tiny spec of dust from behind enemy lines yay! we actually did something whilst our home in the North is about to be taken off us completely!" Yay!"

How would you even know if she's trans? She looks like the majority of the cis women I know when they don't wear a bunch of makeup.

Space poor wormholer btw, I'll make sure your ISK explodes gloriously.

I’m only approaching it from my own direction and in that frame of reference it works.

That all changed in 2008, or late 2007 even.

Hey thanks for the reply! Unfortunately customer service doesn't deem issues "stupid" or not. I am a paying customer so they will see my ticket and it will go through the motions. I did not waste their time as they are paid and hired for this exact job! I also doubt that they simply assume that I will "google that shit". That is a very narrow and strange way to come at assisting a customer. In fact, I bet your bottom dollar that they are trained to deal with utter retards like myself, my issue was stupid according to you but I highly doubt I 'bothered' them. To add on to that fact, a healthy customer service experience brings a customer back 75% of the time, no matter the business! Again, thanks for your reply. I hope you have an excellent day.  
---
Say....you seem like the sporting type. Want to 1v1 me in game? I can sense a little bit of anger inside your post, why and wherefrom I cannot say, but maybe a 1v1 tussle shall give you a release? What do you say, bud?
---
There's a difference between starting a corp with friends to have fun and trying to start a successful corp with complete strangers that gets off the ground, though.
---
Dammit, dont do this, my margins on augmented drones are already shit with the elite drone AI market.
---
It is so much fun to see gang warfare play out across our fictional galaxy.  I'm looking forward to the further refinements of the various tribal leaders in extracting wealth from their local populations.  How long until they actually become recognizably civilized?  Will they institute real laws of any kind?  Even just Texas Law?
---
Get Shat on scrubeenie

I’m sorry does that say 600+ titans on the first line there?
---
thanks for the addition

---
Sorry you are getting down voted. I appreciate your post though. It was echoed that their wording was a bit iffy.  Maybe next time the syntax will be tighter.
---
If your Corp or Alliance currently holds one of these sexist try hard edge lords flailing in thr comments, I hope you'll show them the door for good.  Theres really no need for this in our community, period.  Nice to see some Fanfest pics!
---
Yep, which is why i mentioned that caveat.
---
I’d honestly play it just to see how early phase of Eve felt like..
---
[How does it feel to be less dangerous than renters?](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99008073/)
---
True lol
---
Time to install the chinese in the north.
---
Though I'm no nurse, you could do worse, than make your boy a pilot.
---
No, you fabricated the data, unless Init associates aren't part of the imperium now. Fuck off. No one finds your shtick funny anymore.
---
lol wow gottem haha
---
Unless you went on a trip over the weekend or whatever. It's the same with the holiday rewards over Christmas. Going to visit your family over the holidays? Say goodbye to a part of the rewards.
---
I guess I simply don't understand why they don't give a bit more leeway. I mean, it wouldn't hurt anyone at all while making it less punishing for people who don't have access to an EVE client for a couple days.
---
I guess if you’re poor
---
But the fact that the pilot can afford to replace it only matters to the pilot. It's like bragging that the ammo I used to kill a ship is already replaced - no one cares but me, and the person who died certainly isn't comforted or upset by my ammo expenditures.
---
Its many different things for different people, For me i enjoy being a part of the spectacle and being a cog something bigger then myself. 
---
Yes it can get a little boring in TIDI slugfests but theres usually witty banter thrown about or funny jokes in fleet to liven the mood.
---
I will also point out that TIDI grinds are a very small portion of what you experience in null corps.
---
Baitarus?
---
rice is 10/10 with rice.
---
Is there moderation to handle some of these comments? If not are the official forums moderated better? 
---
Maybe I'm just better off staying away from public eve communities until the cultural shift kicks these idiots to the curb.
---
They give you extra days, they aren't giving extra extra days for people who are clearly special cases. Just stop complaining about free stuff already please.

Ah a Minmatar sacrifice to appease the god. Very excellent.

but... they did?

TL;DR:
---
The world doesn't stop and start at your convenience.
---
Like I said above, it isn't the customer services job to assume what I know or to gauge my "laziness". The ticket system is also the only system of communication with a GM, I don't follow your logic. What system should people be reliant on if they have an issue in game?
---
SAD!
---
Yeah but i bet wingspan got that free 1m sp
---
Blue on blue?
---
Well I would think that 99% of people probably toss their issue into Google to see if they can solve the issue on their own, without having to wait in a queue for assistance?
---
If you truly believed that your route was the right way to go about it, then why delete the OP?

*screeches in incel* That statue in the upper right corner is blatant feminist propaganda. The females and gays are coming for muh EVE!!!

Is it time for my obligatory "WiNGSPAN is the purest form of wormholers" statement?
---
The article did give me a good chuckle tho ;)
---
yeet
---
You know, I don’t actually believe some of these comments.
---
I just wanted to share some Fanfest pictures. Over the years I’ve had a chance to talk to a number of female pilots [NOT: people on the Sisters of EVE tour], they are as razor sharp as you’d think you have to be to thrive in that kind of environment.
---
My assumption was that we, as a community, would be over the tragically dumbass concept of sexism when it comes to having women in our community. I don’t even know why I have to type that here. This picture is as non-controversial as it gets. It’s two people engaging in cosplay at Fanfest. How the fuck is that even an issue?
---
Don't bother arguing with him, Bo is trying to take marina fargofoods role as the most retarded goon in the sub. They're both Karmafleet so i'm beginning to see a pattern.
---
whatever dude...my engrish is broken as eve is...i was in sabre at first moments to bubel the sick bee
---
Have a good one in real life.
---
I have already bought my own first real life Keeps.. Fo.. well more like a jettison container couple of years ago. Next I need to upgrade my minmatar corvette to something better. 😬
---
The issue I think most people have is that you couldn't claim the final day reward on 05/20 if you claimed 05/19, because you had to wait for the next downtime, and the event ended on 05/20 at downtime instead of 05/21.
---
I'll probably be downvoted but I think it looks fine if you wanna get your eve fix but don't have much time. 
---
I'd be interested to know if there is going to be an in-game shop(99% there will be) and what it's going to sell.
---
That's the issue I have with the whole situation
---
&gt; They give you extra days
---
I literally have no life, just work, EVE and Reddit. Somehow I managed to end up a day behind. 16 out of 18 days of logging in is a very strange and arbitrary daily.
---
Add to the fact that if you missed out on the 1m SP you basically got nothing for the other 15 days and I can’t imagine why people would be upset.
---
What is the beehive?
---
We are used to seeing a couple of VNIs in every null system, but we could not believe our eyes when we came across a fleet of 20+ VNIs with built-in quick gtfo mechanism.
---
FYI: this got shadow banned by an r/eve moderator despite making it to #1 within the first hour of posting. Thanks to everyone for the discussion. I’ll spruce it up and repost it.

This seems hilariously petty.

It's already not 'every single day', that's the point.
---
Very much this.
---
&gt; As I wanted the skill points I had to bring my work laptop to an air BNB and log in everyday
---
It wasn't every day, it was 16 out of 18.
---
meh, [had worse...](https://i.imgur.com/IWE5YTn.png)
---
Yes I agree with that, it's a poor event.
---
They have Sansha combat sites (anoms and sigs) and Sansha data and relic sites. I think they get a full range of Sansha NS combat sites, but unlike nullsec, you don't get instant farmable respawns (because no ihub).
---
Free Cloaking V!
---
That was sweet. 😘❤️
---
Literally one of the few times I have to agree with this guy... F
---
If they haven't been useful up 'til now, what makes you think they'll be any different in the future?
---
I know. I'm agreeing with you. I circled around to agree.
---
The PI'er in me says: NO!
---
The little troll in me screams: YES!
---
What do?
---
GIVE US SARUM AVATAR SKIN
---
Thanks, but I am not computer savvy. I'm not sure how to make sense of the results.
---
we fought a war to get that space
---
I have to ask, the one on the right- is that a wig or real hair? I mean that it a very flattering manner, very thick locks of hair. Either great wig or genetically blessed.
---
NetEase strikes again.  It went over so well with Diablo fans.
---
Good luck in your travels.
---
ooof straight through the heart.
---
Oh yeah, those jet pilots? 😂
---
Also, I really appreciate the effort that went into the costumes. Amaar Victor!
---
I love Russians, they’re a fun bunch of people lol
---
they are
---
I mean.. I wouldn't totally send thousands of marine legions to wipe out all competition.. even if they are allies. Buy muh coolant and robotics. RIGHT KENNY DREIN? @kennydrein
---
I get what you are saying and I partly agree. I also feel like it would be good for the game if hundreds of titans were just erased at once. At the same time if tidi wasn't a thing I'm sure our tactics would change instead of just flopping our dicks out and waiting for tidi to hit. Especially with citadel timers not being effected by tidi I think it would be pretty interesting
---
I &lt;3 you.
---
Congrats, but that's also kind of a bummer to see such a high value player lost.  I've been stuck in the 1-5bil net worth range due to my constant and embarrassing solo pvp losses. My last one was a 120mil Garmur to a Venture!
---
I'm not all bad though, it had at least 5 killmarks.
---
I think you can. I'm roaming everywhere in a cloaky Loki without a care in the world. I like not having CTA's, or dealing with some wanna-be tyrant/spacelord FC screaming at me, a grown-ass man, because I didn't align to the next gate fast enough.
---
fuck that noise..
---
wtf
---
Same, should of used those 2 spare days they gave you.
---
when I did it they only used two guys to kill me, one was in a carrier but only two
---
Game o thrones and eve online. Kudos
---
I honestly don’t care about other people apart from my own alliance, I don’t support the whole coalition bs..
---
I’m playing to the audience, sue me.
---
I got it on all my accounts.
---
On the other hand, maybe let’s not be childish and admit that 16/18, advertised as both “May 2 - 20” (typically used to indicate “through” the second date) and “through until” May 20th is both confusing and a bit odd.
---
Yeah there's some specials in GE standing... That's not all of us though. Some of us just like content and will float around Catch in billion isk vindis just to see what jumps us (just not near SF territory - because then the answer is a cyno alt).
---
The problem I had is the launcher wouldn't launch one of my accounts. I created a launch group that launched all my accounts. I thought I collected all of the rewards. However, the launcher was skipping one of my accounts but said it started it. Didn't notice until it was too late.
---
Kind of frustrating. But this is CCP, bugs come with the territory.
---
It’s a wig. To engage with the cosplay.
---
To be perfectly honest I don’t think the costume needs the wig.
---
I hate people quitting. But GL. o7
---
It’s cosplay at Fanfest.
---
Sanctioned by the Sixth Empire too.
---
\&gt;  it should be a bit flexible encase someone is out of town for a single day they shouldnt lose the million... 
---
\&gt;&gt; giving players 18 days to claim a total of 16 rewards.
---
Not my design. This is an expression of the Sixth Empire.
---
Nothing is disproved at all.  The ban chart was for \*all offenses\* and obviously does not include anyone who was smart enough to not get caught (or for that matter, got a warning and wasn't caught again).  
---
All we know from that chart is that over that timeperiod X people were banned from each entity.  All reasons are unknown.  Methods for investigation are unknown.  You literally can't say anything conclusive about anything from that pie chart.
---
It works. I'm a fan of going all out for costumes. That's why my viking outfit had 95 pounds of chain mail and not the fake 20. (Was not the best call, eventually got heavy after many meads).
---
Sounds like you won eve, good luck to you unknown spacefriend.
---
I was seeing visual delays in drone movement and cycling of effects while running sites. seems like a momentary delay every other second or so then the client would catch up.
---
It had 2 spare days.
---
Sounds like how I remember vacations.
---
Except they said I could log in on May 20th to collect my day 16 reward. I did that, I was not able to collect.  They blatantly lied in their event advertising. All this does is piss off players. If they want to screw over players with lives, I'll be unsubbing all my accounts. This is my last straw with CCP. 10+ years of BS from them, I'm done.
---
Yeah, I'm in the same boat. It visually looks great, but how the systems work is still pretty up in the air. It doesn't help that I can't read the text in the trailer. :D  
---
I think you *could* abstract EVE Online into something that would work nicely on mobile, but we'll have to wait and see how they approach it.
---
I mean, rage at Dunk all you want. He's a big boy. You aren't going to hurt his feelings. But he's not wrong about kitey bullshit. It's one-sided content. Fun for the kiter, boring for the kitee. It's about as fun as catching someone and getting a cyno dropped on you. 
---
I mean, everyone enjoys the game differently. If you like flying that stuff, by all means, do it. Just don't expect other people to be super excited about it.
---
My GF was in the hospital, some players are in the military, or work as EMTs, nurses, etc that have 24 hour + shifts, some people have vacations or their internet goes down, etc, etc. A 2 day leway is not enough, especially when CCP lied and said you had 3 days of leway. They literally lied about the final day to collect. I logged in on may 20th when they said you could collect the reward and was unable to. They let you collect the may 20th reward for literally LESS THAN HALF the day.
---
They didn't and they lied about being able to collect the reward on may 20th.
---
The first "daily" they made was to kill a single rat to get the rewards every day.  This time you don't actually have to log into a character.  It's getting slightly better.
---
Same. I went to collect on may 20th and advertised and was unable.
---
I get what he's saying, but the fact that they didn't publish 11:00 May 20th anywhere is kinda BS. While I realize most of us are upset because we "assumed" they meant thru 23:59 20th, they could've just avoided this whole situation if they had just been more specific.

If the counter play to this was dropping your own marines and orbital bombarding theirs, I would be down for this shit in a heartbeat.

This seems like a pretty cool idea. As long as there is little to no cost to having a "standard" number of soldiers to guard you PI, if you want more than that, you start to pay more than a small number.
---
Idiot rocket league player tries to demo goalie in wrong game
---
I did the event as advertised. They closed it early on may 20th now allowing MANY players to collect. There's no downside to CCP to just give us the stuff. All they are doing is pissing off players, which I guarantee will cause people to unsub and  be bad for the game overall.
---
&gt; That's why my viking outfit had 95 pounds of chain mail and not the fake 20.
---
I don’t have the talent to build a costume or I’d do that. People who can and then go all the way are *fucking epic!*.
---
95 pounds of chain mail. You absolute BOSS! :-)
---
Some people have lives that take them away from computers.

Takes time to update. example - [https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99007362/supers/](https://zkillboard.com/alliance/99007362/supers/)   ,  More than half of the Ranger Regiment titans in that list left the alliance some time ago

The time window is what many people have an issue with, through 5/20.
---
lol
---
Its a bonus. A gift. If you cant login 16 times out of 18 days, blame your life, not CCP. The rules were clear.
---
CCP:  The players think the mobile game EVE: Echos is dumb.  What do?
---
Pearl Abyss:  Rename it to something else and market it towards Asians.
---
Yup, woke up before DT just to be sure (am USTZ), couldn't claim 16/16.
---
&gt;we  
---
Implying Razor or the rest of your dumpster did shit. Literally carried by Legacy who had goons to back them up.  
---
Also implying FI.RE is anything more than just the halfdead DRF whale merely being kept on live support by dinos milking out the dronebux.
---
My mum broke her arm, I'm a full time single dad with a 9 to 5 job, not staying at home to look after the old dear. I feel screwed out of a pretty good set of rewards... Been online every day since 2006. Don't think all cases where the same. I didn't appritiate the generic response.
---
This is exactly my issue, it was unclear communication with their player-base, and they won’t acknowledge it.
---
Dust 514 was the shit. I really wish it would make a comeback on PC.
---
This is a game for asian market, dont go grabbing pitchforks. Its simply a game for different people.
---
It’s a FAX dumbass, all this one was fit to do was to bump shit.
---
Ok. So you didn't used the API or so. Thank you for the reply.
---
Scout out the area before moving somewhere... at least from zkillboard. Check who lives there and at what timezone and what kind of fleets they run &amp; how good they are at pvp. And use the ingame map stats "shipkills per 24h / podkills" etc to check how active pvp zone area is. Or use out of game map tools like dotlan.
---
What morale drop? Leadership making plans and moves based on reality is somehow bad? If anything, my faith in the decisionmakers of ncpl has been bolstered.
---
I'm thinking about returning to the game and being some kind of wormhole drifter, what is a good plan for that? looking for ship suggestions and loot handling suggestions. My character has almost 40 mil sp. I was thinking stratios or cloaky t3c.
---
Get over a million SP? The most they've ever given out, period? Even for massive server issues. More than the summer of rage? And to be denied because they lied about the final day you could collect? No. This is a classic case of people who got theirs saying fucking everyone else, I got mine.   
---
There's literally no downside to CCP just giving it out. They lose nothing. You know what they lose by not giving it out? The goodwill of many in this community and probably a good amount of subs. I unsubbed over this false advertising. Done with CCP's bullshit after 10 years of it. This was my last straw. I know I won't be alone.  
---
You want to say good, let the players leave, you're not looking at the big picture. Loss of more players is bad for this game. I've been playing since 2007. If CCP and players like you are ready to throw away players over something stupid like this, then the game will die ever faster.
---
IRC? Thats awesome(co)! Some of my best eve memories were 10/11 cobalt edge.
---
"I got mine, fuck everyone else."   
---
This is what you sound like.
---
They sent out a mass auto reply telling everyone to kindly suck a dick. Classic CCP move. It would be less of an issue if they hadn't lied about the final day you could collect.
---
Thanks for the giggles.
---
Annoyed because CCP can't read a calendar and didn't allow people to collect on may 20th as advertised.
---
12b+ for me to get the equivalent in SP.
---
Hell of a lot better than the spew grab.
---
Plenty of us with you. I'll be unsubbing if they don't make good on their advertisement.
---
I'll be unsubbing if they don't collect. I know I won't be alone.
---
Bumping is an exploit. Reported shitheel.
---
So, basically a middle finger to the entire USTZ. CCP knows they have a worldwide playerbase, they should have planned accordingly. There's obviously enough outrage here to do some damage, so the "fuck you, i got mine mentality" from so many players isn't gonna help.
---
They didn't advertise that properly.
---
I'm presuming it's just a way to call them Chinese/Asian, which I guess is supposed to speak for itself.
---
Took about 30sec each morning.  Never affected my career/life
---
Goodluck, buddy!
---
I wonder if they would try again to merge platforms. Can't wait to get my ass handed to me by a 8yo asian on a cellphone.
---
I could use more isk to blow up submarines in this simulation.
---
LOL
---
"Lied"
---
Turn down your sense of self entitlement please.  They didnt lie.  The event ran from DT day 1 to DT day 16.  Which happened to be about 4 am pst for US folks.
---
That's not very nice
---
implying our coalition with xix. I remember spending 16 hours in multiple fleets every day. And hey I remember test's 20 man frigate fleet waving us in local. Yes we were exhausted by the past wars. DRF was scattered. XIX and RZR stayed together. But I do not shit talk about your war in north because I was not part of it. You are not part of this war so do not speak, please.
---
Same, I play during dt switch and it was an easy event, flew to get my son during it and still didn't miss a day, people can preplan if they want to. How hard is it to open the window once a day and hit claim, even if you aren't going to play until after work or something else, did it on multiple accounts myself and added 10 minutes to my wake up routine. Group accounts in launcher, launch group, go brush your teeth, shower, come back claim then close each account really quick takes like 5-10 minutes if you have a laggy computer/lots of accounts.
---
I dont know if this sounds rude, I really hope it doesnt, but I want to say it because seeing this makes me happy. I think it's really adorable to see an old lady dressed up in amarr clothing. I dont really now why, but its cool to see old people enjoying a game that I enjoyed when I was 15 :)
---
MadOnline (TM)
---
They were making a joke :)
---
Very well done
---
Yeah, always be moving, then if there's something weird you haven't thought of that gives away your position, you still are unlikely to get dropped right on top of.
---
You weren’t really helping the effort there.
---
Bjorn bee's public channel. He is a chill twitch streamer that does public fleets most days at 18:00 out of jita.
---
Search bjorn bee on twitch to see vids of previous roams.
---
Be honest.  Is this something you think CCP could actually pull off?  Think before answering about their track record where new features are concerned.
---
I love how many players think that pissing off a ton of players with lives is a good thing. You do understand all this does is piss off an alienate many players and cause them to unsub. I will be unsubbing over the false advertisement from CCP here. 10 years of BS and I'm done. I know I'm not alone. If you think that's fine, then enjoy your game dying even faster. Shit like this is why Eve is in decline.
---
Good response.  If you didn’t get all your “free stuff” ... HTFU.
---
Thanks for the advice man. I'll keep in mind the locator service.
---
I love all the people that somehow can't comprehend not having computer access for 24+ plus period. You really just can't imagine people not living like you, can you?
---
Didn't want your stuff anyway!
---
Then you don’t get all the free stuff.
---
"Oh, you can't login at 4am? Fuck you then."  
---
That's what you sound like. There's no downside to CCP extending this reward. Literally all this does is piss off players and cause people to leave the game. If you want to keep playing the "fuck you, I got mine, get good scrub" card, then fine, but all you're doing is causing players to leave the game, which is bad for it overall.
---
Have fun in what ever you do next. And also you can always come back to play casually.
---
You're not alone man, we just have to fight through all the "fuck you, I got my reward." players and show CCP they'll take a revenue hit if they don't do something. I've already unsubbed.
---
b-but they made a game that wasnt for us!
---
i say pitchfork time
---
\---E
---
Not sure how that's funny to you? Like, how can you not see this angering people enough to leave the game? You think less players in Eve is good, well, good for you.
---
"I only had to eat one turd this time instead of two, so it's an improvement."
---
Are you literally trying to claim credit for winning a war because you toasted the fucking sov when it was basically over? That's some next level mental gymnastics there. Also please talk about war in the north, i already got you on the hook after all.
---
"My name is ReedIcculus and I have no idea how to put myself in other people's shows or imagine a world where I don't have 24/7 access to a computer and internet."
---
They didn't close it earliy, you misunderstood the text.
---
If people leave because they are to retarded to follow basic instructions amd the easiest event in the games history then k.
---
You are not entitled to free stuff.
---
No never check it what could go wrong lol.
---
Well, then you don’t get all the rewards.  HTFU
---
I'm brain-draining my main and starting over fresh somewhere else. Will feel like a new beginning. Nice.
---
I see many older faces at Fanfest. I’m not the youngest there either.
---
It is a game that, for the player to truly enjoy it, you have to have lived a little. It needs a level of maturity on the part of the player.
---
There is a system, I haven’t visited it yet, where people have put up a cemetery dedicated to the pilots we have lost over the years. In EVE you can build a cemetery to honour the memory of lost friends. How many places allow players to do that? 
---
My firm conviction is that we have not actually scraped the surface of what it is possible for EVE to be. The things we could build there, the things we could do there.
---
Another thing with an older player base is: you’re not going to easily offend people who’ve been around a while. There is a depth of perspective. The conversations can be epic.
---
The hangovers can be quite legendary.
---
“Hey, where’re you going?” [someone standing in the street at one of the pub crawl pubs]
---
- I’m going to the art house cinema
---
“Why don’t you join us for pub crawl?”
---
- Didn’t buy a ticket...
---
“*pfff...*" proceeds to hand me a beer. “Here, grab this one, I’ll get another.”
---
It is a meeting of the minds. Few things are so stirring as talking to people who vibrate on the same frequency.
---
yeah i know how that feels. last time i fought your gang the same thing happened. ;)
---
Go to null.  There are low level sites in nullsec that will be able to give you the same piloting experience as missions will.  You will also have safety in numbers whereas hisec gives you a false sense of security as you can still be killed but noone will be there to back you up.  If you joined a good corp you shouldnt need to even bring anything with you, just change your home station remotely (you can do this once per year) and self destruct your pod.   This will take you to your new home and a good corp will provide you with some basic ships for beginner mining, ratting, and even combat ships for standing fleet pvp.
---
Its OK when not everyone can win.
---
Otherwise winning would be meaningless.
---
Yes bitter scotch, keep that salt flowing
---
Sorry to hear that you are leaving. Can I have your stuff?
---
its quite sad we're at a point people who buy caps can't even move them by themselves
---
Really a bad decision from ccp... it should have been givent to everybody in 1 clic. Ccp should remember that this event is to thank the player, not to got artificialy more number logged.
---
Have a great day
---
How long is a string....
---
It depends, if you like exploration, sure. if you like market warfare maybe, if you like hunting in 0.0 maybe, if you like hunting in WH maybe, if you like missions sure. and so on.....
---
If anyone unsubs EVE Online, because they didnt get free 20 days of skills and some SKINs and other useless things, then they are dumb as fuck and wont be missed.
---
I would say the only people with a reasonable argument are the ones who's only login avaliable times were when the login server was having issues and unable to login to claim that day do to CCP software issues.
---
I myself had this issue but was luck enough to have the 2 extra days to compensate. Sorry to all who's rl schedule prevented them from claiming all 16
---
unsubbed
---
I am a player in the military. It took me literally 2 minutes as I was changing to log in and claim. Those that couldnt log in for the rewards, knew they weren't getting them. And everyone you listed there knows thier lifestyle precludes a login reward (no clue how many events I've missed in 10 years).
---
You missed a day, or 2. It happens. Life happens.
---
It's a damn game. Move on.
---
Project No...... No wait nevermind
---
leave space violence out of this
---
&gt;Ccp should remember that this event is to thank the player, not to got artificialy more number logged.
---
Nope.  The event it so artificially boost the number of logins to get more money from their owners.  Dressed up as a "thank you" to the players.
---
says the guy evac'ing an entire region lol
---
well, it also started at downtime so it was kind of expected
---
you also had 2 extra days... which is why most people aren't showing a lot of sympathy
---
1 million SP is hardly a "bonus".
---
&gt;My GF was in the hospital
---
Then why the fuck do you care?  Some things are way more important than a free stuff in a video game.  Like your GF's health.
---
Then it would have to be a lot more expensive to scramble local fleet comms, rename it "Mobile Fleet Communication Scrambler"
---
Yikes make you really wonder how many are inactive. Id say this is probably less than half of the gross given PCU over last couple months....erm years.
---
Lol dude still salty about? Dont let me down, thought u were cool dudes.
---
Yup, those are the options.
---
Thank you! Will try that tool!
---
sisi
---
:( I'm still traumatised
---
The Autism is real with this one
---
Thanks for the 5 bill, mate.
---
I have been playing since 2010.  Again, you don't know what happened with the deal offered to Sort, this much is readily apparent.  And with TEST, you yourself stated they were allies.  As soon as it was no longer convenient to have them as friends, NCPL stabbed TEST in the back.
---
As any diplomat in the game who they would trust the word of, NCPL or GSF, and they will 100% of the time state GSF.  That is because GSF doesn't break their word, NCPL does it on the regular.
---
Sorry that you don't know anything about the game, it must really suck to be you.
---
Well I’m by no means “expert” but from what I’ve seen float around is that mobile games seem to be really profitable and cost way less to develop and maintain compared to pc MMOs.
---
This brings me to the idea, if Eve mobile could be successful enough that they would be willing to invest those profits into Eve 2, that would be nice.
---
Unfortunately I don’t think it would actually happen, specially as Eve is such a niche game unless there’s actually a way that would be great.
---
Nice job getting so far in EVE! All good things must come to an end, true, but one thing: NO.
---
It is a bonus. What the hell is with all the butthurt children in this thread, you didnt get free stuff cause you didnt follow rules, your problem, now go play the actual game. 1 milion SP is 2-3 injectors, thats just a bonus. One nice skill to 5. No big deal. HTFU.
---
Lmao, your narrative is always funny.
---
Have fun in your future endevours.
---
Lol, bye.
---
&gt; but... they did?
---
Sure, 2 days over a period of 2 weeks. I mean, I got my rewards, so whatever I guess? Still don't understand why they don't give a few more days. I mean, it would literally hurt not one single person. What would the downside be of letting it run over 1 month? Have been logging in every day you get your rewards now, have been on vacation for a week? You get them a week later.  
---
Especially this time, as it's an anniversary event and CCP was probably hoping to get a couple former players to look back in.
---
I a. Having a blast too
---
Be nice
---
Good luck bruh. Thanks for the fun stories.
---
I just used teamviewer to claim rewards when I was away from pc. Takes 5 minutes per day.
---
But that's 9 fighters, so it's like ... 11 people? /s
---
Will they be releasing it globally at all? It looks beautiful and we should all be able to play it!
---
no I am not. I am trying to say that we had 5 cta and strat ops in a day because of that war. We won that war with hardwork. Also I am not going to insult you because of a reddit comment you made, I will keep my level.
---
Cool story, renter. do you have any screenshots to back that up? I love the 'pet references' considering we out form'd slyce by a factor of 20 every CTA. How many ihubs does 'literally triggered' hold? zero? how many do blades or lorde or weekend warriors or any other alliance in winter hold? zero? interesting. pretty much the definition of pet trash tier alliances. maybe formups tell a different story?. Blades max forms 12, lorde  11. LTRIG forms 2. even iron crown out-forms you. ask Noraus for an ihub, come back and let us know how that goes. Even blades can't hold their own ihub where their keepstar is anchored lol but hey, you guys like being 3rd class citizens in winterco. by all means, stay renters.
---
Some of the rewards seemed like a stretch just to hit 16 days of 16 years
---
Gunnery towers to protect the colony from aggressive AI rogue drones? Orbital bombarding to soften up settlements so that sabotage has a higher chance of success and reduce their yield/planet exhausting industrial efforts? Marines to strengthen your defenses?
---
&gt;"Fuck you, I got mine." Mentality is pretty ugly.
---
so is crying like a baby goat (or something else that cries in a terribly pathetic manner). ask yourself if throwing a tantrum and unsubbing is the rational  thing to do. if you still feel this way, good riddance?
---
Hows your cobalt edge deployment going?
---
I'm butthurt you cant spell calendar.
---
While this will obviously get flooded with microtransactions, if you ignore them for a second you have to admit this is a very well thought-out and solid concept. The graphics, UI and gameplay elements look actually usable and effort clearly placed into-them, rather than being a quick cashgrab copypaste like everything else in the mobile industry nowadays.
---
Just because mobile gaming is cancer, doesnt mean that everything is. I know I would 100% gladly be playing this myself if it was available in the west and didnt have chinese mtx system.
---
Hate to burst your bubble (not really) but your hard work didn't win anything.
---
i need dis
---
ccpls
---
lol fuck off with your entitled attitude... we don't need any more of you retartds weighing down this game with your entitled attiftude of not log in dail;y... your the type of useless not show up to CTA, you are bad
---
its retarded to smugpost about killing a triage in yool 2019
---
I don’t see a problem....I was on business for a whole week during this and still managed to login each day and collect rewards from 8 omegas.
---
I’d love to. Life does not afford me all that many chances.
---
so do you, writing this didnt make you win anything other than losing your precious time. Please do not write without knowing, seeing what was happened.
---
I love this strawman argument. Like, do you have no empathy at all for people with lives or ability to see why players would be mad they didn't get the largest SP giveaway in game history because they had RL conflictions? This isn't some measly reward. This is over 12b in free SP for me personally. The game will lose players over this and will be worse off. Play your moronic "entitlement" argument all you want. There's no downside to CCP to just give out the reward. They lose nothing.   
---
By denying so many players all they do is create more angry players that are hostile towards them.
---
pce, enjoy playing with vnis and multibox rourqs
---
Yes, a joke at the expense of trans women. One of the most marginalized, alienated and brutalized minorities. Its not funny or acceptable.
---
It's sad how shortsighted most eve players are. You really need to feel superior for clicking a button like a good monkey, don't you?
---
and thats whats wrong with the game
---
Then you wouldn't feel accomplished getting it
---
Then... you don't get the rewards?
---
It's a bonus, an addition, not something you are entitled to.
---
Nah, i was amused so that's a win in my book.
---
I forgot that everyone lives in the same timezone
---
Nice to see some Eve players are humans with empathy instead of "fuck you, I got mine. I'm elite for pressing login like a good monkey."
---
Thanks! We have always prided ourselves on taking any reasonable fight. Never cared about losing ships, losing fights, etc if there was a possibility it was winnable. 
---
Look forward to future fights, thanks for not joining the sperging
---
go on then.
---
Yet so many players are defending this event. (Noticeably only the ones who got the free million sp) It's kind of sad.
---
Same
---
Do you really think CCP should be responsible for vetting every single exception over the course of an event?
---
Nah, you set a strict time slot, if some people have "life" stuff that interfere's, sucks to be them, that's life.
---
I stopped at 15/16 I guess it felt like a kick in the teeth, but then again I admit I delayed a lot, bye bye 20 days worth of free SP.
---
100% agree. That's why I didn't play for a year. Just came back for the war tears
---
So fuck USTZ people specifically? Much better.
---
Is that a trans-woman, or are you assuming that?
---
As an outside observer, the only person acting out of line in this particular string of comments is you, but I also recognize the fact that I don't have all the info.  I saw the two woman, and I liked the picture, then I saw his comment, and I chuckled.  Did I ever think that either woman was a man?  No.  Nor did I feel like the joke marginalizing or alienating.
---
A difference of opinion is a difference of opinion but keep in kind mind that aggression won’t typically bring people over to your side.
---
Isn't this supposed to be a thank you to the players that supported CCP? This was a pretty big middle finger to myself as a 10+ year Eve vet. Lots of people feel the same. Funny that the only people I see defending this were the people that got their free 1m sp. This isn't a trivial reward, and you are incredibly shortsighted and lacking in ability to understand other peoples lives and how they might feel about this move by CCP. If you want to say "fuck you" to all those unable to press a button like a good little monkey to give CCP good log in statistics, then enjoy your game with less players in it. It's bad for everyone.
---
I'm done interacting with complacent fuckboys today though. L8r
---
There were plenty of days that I couldn’t play but found the time to log in to claim my stuff. Some of the stuff did seem to drag it out though.
---
I wonder if this is alluding to triglavian caps?
---
I dont even live in null and dont have cap skills. And I have great time playing the game.
---
Is it `free stuff` if I resubbed my account specifically for this?
---
&gt; dont go grabbing pitchforks.
---
Damn, I was hoping to break out the pitchfork. Maybe next time.
---
Funny, I actually am consistently #1 on KB for whatever corp or alliance I am in. I show up to the majority of all fleets, CTA or not. But, nice strawman moron argument. I'm also an FC. I play this game quite a lot. I just happened to have a RL event come up during this event, something that rarely happens. And for this I am losing 12b + in free SP? That costs ccp nothing?  
---
I'm not "entitled" I pay my subs on many accounts every months. I'm paying for this service. I can stop paying just as easily, which is bad for everyone. I'm not alone. Eve will lose players over this, which is bad for the game.
---
Maybe get over your "fuck you, i got mine" mentality and learn to see the bigger picture. CCP fucked up here, this was a poor move by them and players have every right to be upset. We pay subs to get these rewards. Many players subbed specifically for this reward and didn't get them. Stop being retarded and use your head for once.
---
And you're talking about strawman? Empathy is a a fucking strawman argument.
---
Its a event that gives you free stuff, of course you have to do something to get it. 
---
L m a o
---
There will definitely come a suitable occasion. Also please dont take it out when Triglavian Invasions fuck witch null residents. That would be great.
---
You didnt even need to load a charcter, juet get to charcter select scren. Take like 5 seconds.
---
Way to reply to yourself, Captain Outrage
---
Clearly your priority is wrong... hope whatever shit group you part of dies if this is atitude you have
---
"Yeah, less players in Eve. Fuck you, because I'm superior for clicking a log in button like a good monkey!" That's what you sound like. If you think less players in eve is "good riddance." you're fucking retarded.
---
Yes. When you sub you pay for omega time, not those items
---
If you buy a pizza and get a free soda for it, the soda is free because thats not what you paid for.
---
If they raised their prices during this event you could say this
---
Yeah, pretty shitty think to be penalized for by CCP. I pay many subs every month. I lost over 12b+ in free SP due to false advertising. How so many players are blind to being able to comprehend something so simple is insane. A lot of people call me entitled, but you guys just enjoy feeling superior, you somehow feel more entitled than everyone else because you clicked a button like a good monkey. It's sad.
---
something something module teirecide
---
Shit I just want to be entered into the five away
---
2 days is fuck all.
---
please don't post garbage facebook memes, tia
---
Obviously a fake video, since it's got marshy shooting brave, and we all know he only ever shoots goons
---
I'm so tired of explaining what having a life is to you entitled neckbeards. Jesus christ. Learn what empathy is. And maybe learn to see the bigger picture. This is giving many players a poor experience and poor perception of CCP. It's causing people to unsub. It's bad for the game. These rewards cost CCP nothing. Get a fucking brain.
---
Salted Carmel?
---
12b+ in free SP is nothing to shake your finger at. It's also the principle of CCP once again fucking up and falsely advertising. I've dealt with 10 years of BS from CCP, last straw for me. Others aren't alone. If you think players leaving over this is a good thing, then enjoy your even more empty game, I guess.
---
Everything announced in Eve that has a date/time is going to be EVE TIME and everything will always end or begin at downtime... Not sure why this is so hard to understand... The event did run untill the 20th at downtime, as they ALWAYS do, and as they are always advertised to do, if you logged on on the 20th and punched your computer because you couldn't accept that's on you... Read and understand the rules before blaming others for your oversight.
---
You weren't penalized by CCP.  You were given two choices:
---
1. Complete the event
---
2. Care for your GF
---
That's it.  Bitching and moaning that there isn't a choice 3 doesn't make a choice 3 appear.
---
And CCP isn't penalizing you.  You made your choice.  It's the correct one.  You just don't always get everything when you make the correct choice.
---
There's a lot of mobile arcade games that would make great minigames inside EVE. From traditional Tower Defense to a more modern Clash of Clans type of thing. There's a game called Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberium Alliances that I thought was pretty cool both graphics and gameplay wise. Wouldn't mind having a minigame like this as an extra layer to do 'advanced' PI.    
---
I'm guessing the main excuse is getting it working with legacy spaghetti code. They could probably outsource up-and-coming game developers to make minigames for them for cheap, but getting it integrated and running with the decades old code of EVE would require a lot of manpower and resources that CCP management wouldn't be willing to give.
---
Sorry, you didn't press a button for it. So, I'll be biomassing it instead.
---
The joke was implying that she is a trans woman. It was a joke at the expense of trans women which implied that trans women are male.
---
I had already stated in my first comment that she looks cis to me.
---
Once again. The joke was inherently in refrence to trans women and was the only comment which made the assumption you are claiming I am making.
---
If it's out of line to call out inappropriate and biggoted behavior on this board then I will continue to be out of line until I'm banned.
---
boy bye
---
MONEY
---
That hasn't been CCPs motto for 5+ years.
---
Classy.
---
I agree, you could say that 16 out of 18 is pretty tight compare to most other event and other game event but thats up to the experience team i guess.
---
The challenge for many i guess is that when they say the event run to the 20th of May that's not "true" for allot of players. Taking myself as an example, if i log in 9 am on May 19th that's the final time i get rewarded in the event, there is no "May 20th" as if i log in before down time on may 20 i am still technically on May 19th and after down time the event is over.
---
All itll tell you is maybe where theres a problem, but what to do about it is a different question. The problem isnt CCP from what I can tell, it's a bad hop somewhere between US West and TQ
---
ah gotcha.  I fly through null alot, and I have 350 days until I can fly a kestral on equal footing to older players despite the amount of injectors i've already purchased, so the idea of those same players getting even more SP tilts me.  
---
I'll go back to playing games where everyone always has equal footing.
---
And then get counterdropped by bus in police skin. Nice.
---
You could always stick up plex, and queue a years worth of skills to come back to if you change your mind, but best of luck!
---
So if Netflix said they have Batman but when you pay for it they don't have Batman it's ok because you payed for Netflix, not Batman?

---
&gt; Get a fucking brain
---
You're right.... it stops and starts at down time... ohhh wait.
---
I literally was. "Oh, you didn't log in? No rewards for you." CCP said, Do this or be penalized. Literally by definition. You're a moron.
---
I heard they released classic WOW, maybe you can go relive your preteen years there instead of on r/eve. You sure as hell complain like a little self entitled cuck.
---
Here's some empathy for you: I'm sorry that you feel like losing login rewards is non-trivial when a loved one is in the hospital.
---
lol. I'm done here, you're an idiot.
---
Sucks to suck
---
Lol."I don't like your opinion over a video game, so I hope you and every person in your group has a shitty experience." What a garbage person you are.

PodLA will end up farming him anyway, he will be top on their KB, just not the way he wanted, lol

Obligatory did you just assume my gender, or is that just some slang the SJWs use now?

Are you honestly so high and mighty that you can’t see how you’re acting?  Yeah, their joke was mildly offensive, but you're wholly offensive as well.  If mild offensive humor offends you, please go back to Tumblr, if that platform still exists.  There is a downvote button for a reason; you do not have to call people douche-bags when you disagree with them and then go edit your post to make yourself look better when people call you out.

Once you start huffing at a wormhole gas site, how long until it despawns? I want fresh gas sites to spawn.
---
Whoa there.
---
First off, you're the one coming off entitled.  I go, literally, months without internet. Ive missed completing every log in campaign until this one. I've missed 90% of the in-game events. That's the life of those people you invoked.
---
Second, if you "have a life" then you understand that shit like this isn't for you. If your panties are in such s trust over not getting done SP, in a virtual world, is time to re-evaluate your priorities. Those of us with lives understand login campaigns cost us, and then, nothing. And we aren't entitled to those rewards.
---
CCP will gladly give you sp for any Omega time you weren't training, because they understand people have a life and can't log in all the time.
---
Stop complaining because life handed you a bad series of days. It happens.
---
Wtf are you talking about
---
As soon as I saw the big reward was on the last day of. Laiming, I knew this was going to be a huge mess. How do CCP keep making such simple to avoid mistakes like this?! I got the full SP on my subbed accounts but somehow almost missed it on one. Like you said, it's a thank you to the players for 16 years. But it wasn't. It was a thank you to the autustic min/maxers and a fuck your to anyone that has played for years and can't login everyday.
---
Not until august, but yeah I'll be saving a ton of money and time to go play WoW. Unironically that's my plan, but thanks for attacking me personally for my interest in a game? You sound like a garbage person irl.

---
Has anyone else noticed the increased amount of hospitalized friends and extreme overtime since this event was coming close to an end? 
---
Click login push claim, you failed to do that? Oh noes 1 mil sp AKA like $8. If you're in the military like you're all claiming or doing all this crazy overtime and vacationing just fucking buy a plex and stfu.
---
And you just know the genius who came up with this response is completely unable to comprehend the fact that people might not appreciate coming back from rl to see they couldn't in fact get their 16th day.
---
Yeah, I'm glad some people agree. But, most of the community seems happy to say fuck you, I got mine. Kind of sad.
---
the whole concept is to get people to log in consistently every day in hopes they will do more than click the accept box and log back off, if they spread out the rewards then people are more likely to not try to complete the entire event and just settle for getting a few of the nicer things and not all of them.  Unfortunately this type of daily activity doesn't actually lead to increased players in space just increased log in numbers which look nice on a executive summary of the event, but in reality don't have an impact on the game at all which is why most games that feature "dailies" actually require you to do something involving game play beyond just logging in to get your reward.
---
Enjoy your summer. See you in the Fall! :)
---
I'm so tired of people acting like this is some trivial reward. This is over 12b+ in free SP for me alone. It's the biggest SP giveaway in Eve history, even more than for massive server issues or the summer of rage. It's complete bullshit. This was an extremely poor move by CCP and the amount of morons defending it is insane.
---
I said that because WOW is the cookie cutter, spoon fed MMO, which is what your attitude has suggest is needed for your safe space.
---
I am garbage IRL though, cannot attest that. However, i take solace in the fact that im not some sweaty man baby crying over a video game and playing the victim on reddit. so i guess my life is pretty rad.
---
how many hands does it take to hold up your gigantic epenis
---
Hey man it doesn’t matter, people will always find something to complain about.. 
---
Few months from now some random will pop up, 
---
“Why did you give the rewards around that time for only 18 days? I was deployed on the moon fighting hitler, I couldn’t make it and log in every day.”
---
Something somewhere went terribly wrong for eve when a single alliance has 600+ titans and most likely 1000+ moms. How could you even begin to fix this?
---
Or are the majority of people really ok with this?
---
I use The Judges hands i bought from some serb.
---
Probably legacy and imperium would have to unite to help him hold his large ecock, that Bhaalgorn must be the size of a titan..
---
Only CCP could manage to fuck up giving out 1,250,000 free SP so badly that people quit the game over it. 
---
I got my free SP but knew this would happen as soon as I saw the big reward was on the last day.
---
its slang hunni

diminishing returns \* 17 skills isn't very diminished at all.  Yesterday I decided to try and fit a hookbill, I can't even fit it without giving up a lowslot and 1 rig.

Hi Jester - industrial player here that has definitely hit your site and APIs more than a few times. No questions, just want to say thanks for everything you've done over the years for EVE and the playerbase. Best of luck in your post-Eve endeavors.
---
I'm not smug I just think the instant karma for being cocking was funny.
---
that is how you know you are doing something right. well done
---
read your endless rage all over this topic. you seem to have problems well beyond "clicking log in like a good monkey!". seek help.
---
I stand by my method of "It never hurts to ask"
---
Just don't be upset when they say "No" since you know fully well they're going to.
---
&gt;  invest those profits into Eve 2,
---
Hilmar said there won’t be, there can’t be, an EVE 2.0.
---
After a send off like that, do you really think you won’t be back again? Or are you just making sure that you won’t be tempted?
---
I always find myself crawling back to Eve
---
Publishing GM communications, this can only end well.

I don’t really care what they do with the mobile version.

Not wild about the music they use.

This is r/eve. R/eve isn't the community.

Idk who downvoted you for this, but that cosplay sounds awesome
---
Oi I'm a logi goon. So that means f2, f3 and if i'm in my Basi maybe even the elusive Control-F1+2
---
Well that’s unfortunate then, once Eve is done dying as everybody says, I guess our last hope for something as close to Eve would be star citizen if we don’t outlive the release and dual universe which I have mixed feelings about as well..
---
Then they should have read the rules.
---
I might go Omega now just so you aren’t missed.
---
Little Goon, that’s no way to talk about your brilliant leader the Mitanni. Because this is literally what he did, and the results speak for themselves.
---
Slaves and slaver hounds to boost production... And the possibility to "free" them (aka let them work in your own colonies... ;) )
---
Soomeone so salty about their place in eve they downvote my name or init automatically because that's the only thing they have left.
---
Oof, lmao
---
Pure curiosity here: what are you up to that doesn't have internet connection and a laptop once a day?  
---
I know there are things (obviously) I'm just wondering what it was for you.
---
Sorry to see you leave.
---
Don't biomass just in case.
---
Then get your fitting skills up a little bit and you're there. You're literally the same skill as everyone who flies hookbills. Me training rocket spec to 5 vs 4 gives me a negligible advantage. I can't go invent new skills to help me. And yet I could fly a 2m sp caracal and whoop the most elite hookbills in the universe.
---
I mean CCP should have given you all day on the last day listed on their promotional dates. Really the promotion ended 05/19 not 05/20, because there is no physical way to claim a reward for the day of 05/20 (after downtime), unless you hadn't claimed anything between 11:01 and 23 59 on 05/19.
---
if you ever have a fair fight in eve somebody did something terribly wrong
---
Looks like they're having an issue with SSL/the certificate.  It'll probably be fixed reasonably quickly.
---
give me a 1mil sp and i'll do that, Although honestly i'm not even sure what skill i'm missing that makes my fitting so rough on the hookbill.
---
Have fun
---
Let me clarify again because you obviously missed it the first time.
---
"Returning player..."
---
Shits changed since I was here last as I said in my fucking post.
---
And people have given awesome answers.
---
Thank you :)
---
Thanks :)
---
You only take a break from eve unless you extract down to 5 million SP. So, therefore I am willing to help you win. I will humbly accept all of the the injectors you fill (free of charge). Lol. Anyways good luck IRL.
---
What is the symbol on the shoulder?
---
I personally use eve market data. But I haven’t found that it lets you input multiple things at once.
---
Your data are incorrect because everyone knows Provi doesn't have caps.
---
Shit that reminds me I need to check my PI.
---
More scary for the server than for PanFam.  The server can't unanchor itself and run away.
---
They are the new PanFam buddy in Etherium?

Seems logic. Now whithout US+LHK+JaG, PanFam run the place and they need a new home.

It is funny you make the assumption that he can empathize with your situation but you instantly assume he is on 24/7.
---
He wasn't being a dick head, you are.
---
Sucks to lose out but they set out the rules ahead of time.
---
Yeaaaaah. As a gay guy with a fuckton of trans friends, I can assure you that you are literally the worst type of person.
---
That's not the Space Pope!
---
It's called microtransactions
---
Buy all the Harpys, Jackdaws, Muninns, and Eagles on Jita. Wait a few days, then sell them at a profit.
---
Depending on what alliance you're with, if any, there's war profiteering to be had. Market PvP.
---
Still a thing.
---
Star Citizen’s ambition is decidedly less grandiose than EVE Online is.
---
Try having a 4000-pilot fleet fight with all those polygons.
---
I’ve seen their game mechanic, I’m just not convinced. They have a salvaging ship. They claim it’s one of the larger ships in their inventory. I can park three of them into my Iteron Mark V.
---
Their ship is a salvager. You would go on a mission, with several players in one ship, and do various activities with regards to salvaging. Really?
---
I don’t even know whether there’d be an opportunity for a meta game like EVE has.
---
EVE, warts and all, is so far ahead of what everybody else is doing that nobody’s even trying to make something like it.
---
That’s why I feel like there should be features that go beyond PvP and PvE. It should be a place where you can build more things [that can then be destroyed], that would derive their use from having a positive impact on EVE as a society and therefore would be worth defending / maintaining.
---
Give EVE pilots tools to build content and they’ll find entirely new ways to create meaning.
---
EVE features should be tools that allow for building new narratives in the game. About how they work, about why they are used, about who is using them.
---
If it’s done right this would create interdependencies that support one another. I’m not remotely assuming this would be easy, but it would cement it as a viable third place because people of all stripes can go there and be something they can’t be in the real world.
---
Star Citizen... I like their ambition but they’re never getting there. The only reason they’re still doing what they’re doing is that so many people gave them so much money that they could build something resembling a universe. It’s not been seriously tested [that I’m aware of] as a viable place to have the kind of epic adventures that EVE Pilots have.
---
On the mobile side, I can see where that would generate revenue, and I understand that importance. Not at all sure how that would work and what the player gets out of it other than a close association with a universe they don’t really understand.
---
I never thought I would agree with a goon, but here we are

Still, you had fun, and that's what counts. Probably many can't even claim that much. o7, Pilot!
---
Just as an example so you get an idea, bought bunch of Kikimora blueprints at 60-80mil a piece and resold them between 160-190mil within 2 weeks, not sure what the current price is tho.
---
I also bought like 30bil worth of crystalline isogen at 160k-180k a pop and resold them when they spiked to around 290k within a few weeks.. There’s some really good opportunities if you’re patient enough..
---
Doing well in school is more important than 1mill sp. Good to hear you prioritized the important things in life.
---
Wow, fascinating.
---
Thanks for keeping this critical issue alive.
---
I would think that is a unit badge.
---
I did not get to ask that question, I’m not sure. On uniforms I’d take something like that as a unit badge.
---
It's a mass reply. And I'm anonymous anyway. Not too worried about it.
---
I just want better mobile integration do get my marketing fix while working
---
I did not make that claim?
---
Fun random side fact: In the original 2009 demo of Walking In Stations, a crude RTS-like game was demonstrated in the corporate office (I believe it was turn-based, can't remember...).
---
...okay, that aside. I think if they did this it would be super cool, but they might need to slightly buff PI output if it were implemented. Especially if there are randomized NPC threats that you'd need to arbitrarily set up defenses against. Right now PI is a bare trickle of income; if I need to start spending a portion of my com center's fitting on arbitrary defenses, it might need a tweak to avoid a market upset.
---
Don't you have phones?
---
So from what I see here...
---
penif does what penif does and accidentally smug talk Intel into local. Goons manages to kill him with said intel, penif is a chillboi about it, and someone thinks it's a good idea to come to reddit to smug about the kill. In the end, Goons looks dumb on reddit and penif gains points for being a lolbro. 
---
Is this the state of the Imperium? We have to smug about free bumplif kills and expose that half the coalition doesn't know what a bumplif is?

---
&gt; It’s not been seriously tested [that I’m aware of] as a viable place to have the kind of epic adventures that EVE Pilots have.
---
You can literally do this *right now* in Star Citizen. The basic gameplay loops are already available.
---
The game ain't done by any stretch, but your information about it seems to be entirely incorrect.
---
Do You dont have phones?????
---
I’ve heard people complain about dreads having exorbitant insurance payouts. What’s the price of a dread before and after insurance?
---
First, you had plenty of time to login so stop it with the excuses. You chose not to take the time and that's entirely on YOU. As to the time it was litteraly nothing, I actually timed it one day. Starting with my PC turned off I was able to turn it on, log into 10 accounts, collect rewards, and be done in less than 3 minutes total. The only way it would take you any longer is if you ran more than 10 accounts or have a non-SDHD, but in either case that would add at most 2 minutes. No matter your exam schedule you had 5 minutes each 24 hour period. You made the choice not to open your hand and take free stuff ccp was begging to drop into your palm. 
---
Second, login rewards are dumb because it doesn't actually increase player counts. Most people were logging in just enough to collect and then closing out. They weren't sticking around to play. Events where you have to actually load the game, kill some shit, and get earn rewards increases players playing. Not only in the short term but potentially in the long run. Way more potential than not having to even load the game.
---
Third, you didn't even have to login. You just launch, collect, close, walk away. You didn't need to get into the game to collect.
---
CCP gave you 18 days to log in 16 times. That leaves you two days to spare. Leaving everything last second isn't really their problem.
---
Maybe you'll be back. I've quit 3 or 4 times so far. Last time I gave all my assets away and had to start over again when I came back 20 months ago.

It's almost like CCP never does anything wrong or is completely flawless in all respects and anything that happens is the player's problem, right?
---
U/deltaxi65
---
Yeah, because we got over a million SP for free for doing probably the simplest task CCP could have handed us. It's free shit. No chance in hell I'm gonna complain just because some people can't follow some simple rules to get free stuff.

Honestly I would sign in anyways just to make sure I had skills being trained while I was at work. This was just a bonus.

God, Lol, this is cringe af, did you sign the the last jedi and GOT petitions as well? You seem to be missing the point - you had the t&amp;c's, for a few weeks in advance - you failed, suck it up princess!!
---
CCP fuck plenty of stuff up. When they adjusted anom spawns in null it doubled static respawn time in wormholes, for example. Completely unrelated yet somehow got fucked.
---
People being unable to follow some simple instructions and log in for 16/18 days? Not CCP's fuckup.
---
Come on CCP  
---
You should know that if you give a bit of extra time for people to claim rewards/do the event nobody is going to be upset.  
---
Instead it would be "Wow, the event should have ended a day ago, but for some reason I can still claim my reward! This is unusual, but works for me" (overwatch does this)  
---
We are here to celebrate the anniversary, are we not? You only made quite a lot of people (I assume more than 500 players were not able to claim their 16th day in time) sad/angry for missing out.
---
P.S. I missed the cut off point by exactly 39 minutes.
---
Good but I’m a spoopy wormhole boi, if I ever wanna come out to null I’ll hit you up though!  Too many supercaps for my taste :)
---
I haven't touched eve in an equal amount of time.
---
What happened to cause piracy to fade as you say??
---
I don't think anyone who got the rewards claimed to be elite for logging in. They called you an idiot for being unable to follow simple instructions. You in particular, multiple places in this thread, it seems.
---
...it's the internet. Humans are inherently awful. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Dust 514 during the beta was the bomb. But the end-product wasn't as good as the beta. One of the reasons CCP failed with Dust 514 was the marketing.
---
I was at a beach retreat my friend invited me to for his birthday. I only have a desktop, nobody brought laptops or anything so no eve access. It was only supposed to be for a night, but my GF got really sick and we ended up in the hospital for a second night, so I missed the two day window and couldn't collect on the third extra day.

That was my favorite part of pub crawl; it was for everyone, even if you forgot to buy a ticket. Running across random groups and just hanging out while drinking.... massive amounts of beer was great! Some of my best memories were after the 3rd bar, where I broke off, accidentally started wandering around, met up with more nerds, and got totally sloshed.
---
cool for you? Like, if you feel like being that vindictive to a stranger for no reason that you'll spend money on a terrible company, all the power to you. You must be lovely irl.
---
All of their events since ever have all started and ended at downtime. Anyone who couldnt figure that out, well, i fear for your future.
---
I hope so. That way CCP feels this in their wallet.
---
This is such a lame hill to die on
---
Have you heard about our Lord and Savior Boosh? Come onnnnn
---
&gt;  You would go on a mission, with several players in one ship, and do various activities with regards to salvaging. Really?
---
Yeah... one of my big concerns about SC has been the constant marketing which can be paraphrased as "and you can get your friends to do the boring stuff on your ship for you!" 
---
Elite Dangerous is trying that but for the most part you just don't get crewmembers. Everybody wants to be the pilot, almost nobody wants to be the door gunner. **Certainly** nobody wants to be the guy running the salvage turret.
---
SC is doing lots of things because they can or because it makes sense in the universe, but none of it seems really *fun*.

They got nerfed a while ago. The current payout is around a 500mil gain, and an unfit dread is around 1.2 bil. Before the change though, it was not unheard of to lose a fitted dread and have it be cheaper than losing a faction battleship.

veracruz is owned by goons, if you weren't aware.

fuckin lol, been waiting for this one
---
That's literally it though. Didn't log in during a log   in campaign, you don't get the rewards
---
It’s for bumping caps off tether. Because Faxes have such huge models they are good for that
---
How are you penalized? You didn't a reward you aren't entitled to. They didn't punish you for not logging in. You didn't have anything that was yours taken away.
---
Life, your life, caused you not to log in for enough days to not get your last reward, not CCP.
---
I actually timed it one day. Starting with my PC turned off I was able to turn it on, log into 10 accounts, collect rewards, and be done in less than 3 minutes total. The only way it would take you any longer is if you ran more than 10 accounts or have a non-ssd, but in either case that would add at most 2 minutes. It doesn't matter if your gf was in the hospital you no doubt left her side for 5 minutes a day. To eat. To sleep. To piss. Most hospitals have free WiFi so that's no excuse. If that one doesn't then use your phone. Walk across the street to McDonald's. Litteraly anything.  You totally could have found 5 minutes each 24 hour period. You made the choice not to open your hand and take free stuff ccp was begging to drop into your palm. 
---
You are the neck beard idiot that doesn't seem to understand 5 minutes out of 1440 in every given day isn't a large sacrifice to give. Now if you were the one in the hospital in a comma then maybe but even then that isn't CCP's problem unless of course that is why Guard left was to track you down and beat the shit out of you.

what is wrong with you
---
But Batman is a free gift for Netflix subscribers so they never need to give it you dingus.
---
It was 100% provoked. We would do it again.
---
Oh man this should be good. How do you recommend changing the bumping lif fit Mr.Spartan546?
---
Haha I knew it!
---
Yeah, that is just a reskin of Echoes isn't it?
---
Let's see Penifs lifetime isk killed in Delve VS his ISK lost in delve.
---
Indeed, taking care of corp buyback and input items one by one, is not the way
---
Finally get to read this shit.
---
Link to the rules? The advert I saw didn't have a fine print and only said the event ran until 20th May.
---
Nah you're marginalising and alienating that user.
---
o_O
---
I literally make all my money from relic sites.
---
Rule of six worth nearly 100% of the time.
---
Also one more tip: The goal node is most likely to be on the other side of the field.
---
If you start in the bottom right corner, there is a good chance the end node is in the top left corner.
---
That doesn't always apply but the likelyhood of it happening is fairly high.
---
The cardinal rule of everything applies here; it depends. If you want to do exploring and maybe some explorer ganking, anything more than an astero is probably overkill. If you want to widen your engagement range but make explo less easy, neut stratios is a beast against lots of active tanked ships, and t3cs can punch way above their weight. If you want to do ratting for long periods of time, you can use a legion (or confessor in c13 hole) because lasers use very little ammo. More advanced tactics would be using a orca or bowhead and carrying around other ships in that, so you can do ratting and mining all at once, or using a nomad dread with alts for scanning and pve. Loot handling for all of these would basically just be scanning down a hisec connection and hiring a hauler to take it to jita for you.
---
Try remoting in with your phone next time.  Plenty of us did that.
---
I drove halfway across the country (24 hour roudtrip drive) to visit my parents for Mothers day but still managed to snag the rewards.
---
It sucks that you missed it, but as others have said, its a bonus given to players who logged in.  If you don't log in, you don't meet the criteria for getting it, simple as that.
---
Honestly if I was in a position where I was away for more than 24hrs for this event on multiple occasions where I knew I wouldn't get the rewards then I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up and would have just accepted what I could and been happy with it. That's just me though, I don't get my hopes up for anything so
---
I had no idea he still played , well done
---
In 1DQ. Will be sold out in a few hours
---
All online games run events based on the server time.  EVE is no different.  CCP says the event runs until downtime on May 20, it runs through downtime on May 20.
---
Imagine them having to list every date / time zone on their email.  Understanding the time difference is the responsibility of the player, not the company.
---
&gt;You didn't like my answer?
---
the answer that didn't answer the question?
---
It's the children part in your question that explains it. My generation failed our children so badly that their issues are coming home to roost. Our kids grew up thinking everyone wins, life is fair, and you are entitled to other people's success therefore you don't need your own.
---
I’m not harping on Star Citizen. Why would I not want it to be a success.
---
You did not really address my concern though. You’re talking about gameplay loops, and that’s a thing, but that’s not what emergent game play is. You can test ‘[feature.set]’ in Star Citizen, you can’t test Star Citizen, because that does not exist [yet]. There is a difference there.
---
EVE Online, if you haven’t seen them you want to see early game play pictures, it looked fucking hilarious, it wasn’t recognisable as a game [by today’s standards]. 
---
But what it did was something Star Citizen has not done to its great detriment: it launched a game. It was a feature set. You could play it. It wasn’t awesome, but you could enter the game universe and do stuff. It was there, it’s been there ever since.
---
Star Citizen has the makings of a game that’s made by a perfectionist: it wants to be perfect on launch day. It is a critical and lethal error in judgement. Star Citizen has been in development for 7+ years now [is it more?]. You still don’t have a game. 
---
I read the original Kickstarter. They were going to raise some money to launch a game. Then, with some extra money, they had stretch goals. What happens: people start throwing wads of cash at CIG, so much that they went apeshit. I just read the Wikipedia page: “*Star Citizen is an upcoming multiplayer space trading and combat game*”. In development since 2011, so 8 years.
---
Think about that for a second. 8 years is about 10% of the life expectancy of the people who have been waiting for it for all these years. And it’s not even close to being released yet.
---
If it had been launched after a few years of development with a core set of features, those core set of features would be the game play you would have been enjoying for all those years. Over time, and seeing how much money people have been throwing at it [$90 million?], they would have added blocks of features to expand the universe, to give players more and more content, and to allow them [and this is crucial] to build their own stories inside Star Citizen, based on existing, actual game play.
---
None of that has happened. It is ‘in development’. It is not a released product. 8 years of nothing but demos to look at.
---
Truth be told: EVE Online is also in development. But they provided a feature set and kept adding to it. People have made epic stories in EVE, its history is being written as I type. It is a living universe. It has its dramas, it captures the imagination. It is being studied by actual scientists [I’ve talked to them on several occasions], its players are some of the smartest people I’ve ever met [outside of a professional environment]. And they could do all that because EVE is an existing universe. It is an actual, exhibited, work of living art in MOMA in New York. I [all of us at Fanfest] have been addressed by the then president of Iceland. It is an entity all unto itself.
---
And all because a bunch of lunatic Icelanders decided they should have a dark space game with a player-driven market. They built it and, as it was feature complete at some point, they just pulled the trigger on a hilariously underpowered system to host the first players, and they unleashed all merry hell on the universe. They built it, they released it. People came and added their stories. They made and make what it is: EVE is real.
---
By the same virtue that EVE is real, Star Citizen is not real. You get to look at the slowly rotating fantastically beautiful and tasty cake as it is rotating in the display case of the bakery, and you can open the door and smell it. But you can’t take a bite. 
---
8 years.
---
By the time you finally get to board that fancy and super expensive space ship you bought, you’re much older, you’re only then ready to really start telling your stories because only then will you have something to tell them in.
---
EVE is how you do life: get on with it. Do something, anything. Get it under way. Make it happen.
---
Steve Jobs said: real artists ship. You can’t build a reputation on good intentions.
---
You can test game loops. 8 years in you get to test basic game loops. That is so painfully said, I cringe at the thought alone.
---
I don’t want Star Citizen to fail. It looks amazing. The artwork is fantastic. That doesn’t make it a game though. I don’t see how they’re going to make it work [not in the short term]. When it’s going to be released [hopefully before your kids graduate high school], you’re going to board your space ship and go, after all those years of anticipation: nah, it’s good, I’m done. I don’t really need it anymore. You will have moved on. Star Citizen will never have delivered the spell of magic you were promised and have been looking for all these years.
---
After all this time you get to test basic game loops. You have no idea, and I say this without a shadow of a hint of sarcasm, how deeply sad that makes me. You should have had so much more by now.
---
Hope they do a special and we could buy some of the others skins.
---
&gt;dont want to get killed too much too early in the game
---
Dying is a regular thing in eve. It is unavoidable, and it’s best to get used to it early. If you do nothing else in eve, learn to me okay with fucking up and dying like an idiot. [trust me, i know](https://zkillboard.com/kill/68290298/)
---
Goons are on that BR. I never said Panfam didn’t deploy supers, I said they didn’t deploy them until after goons arrived.
---
I missed out on the mill skill points due to RL. I am  not mad though, that's life. Their policy was explained and I cannot be mad.

Just means a month longer for command ships V lol.
---
I'd apologize for not giving you a formulaic response to a formulaic back and forth which is pointless, but you're just looking for a response that fits in your tiny box so you can pull out a prepared troll response, right?
---
8 years ago would have been right around the time their rep went right into the dumpster

When he says it's a max formup and doesn't say what it's for, little hard to be useful other than forming up, isn't it?

😅 Jita scammer right there. Should've followed the rules in the bio boys 🤣
---
The mentality that you are entitled to things, don't have to earn them, and everyone around you owes you something is by far way worse. As you are showing right now. You are so pissed off and salty that someone tried to give you a present but didn't give it to you in your preferred way and you think the issue is them. Society is fucked.
---
no, this is called discussion, a thing two reasonable humans do daily
---
if you're new to this, i'm open to answering questions
---
Having logged in probably 90% of the 14years I’ve been subbed to this game, I’m not bitter to miss out on the free SP for all my accounts. 
---
How did I fuck it up ? My laptop charger broke 6 days into the event, while working away in the Swiss alps. I tried to get Mrs Skywarker to log in at home, she did ok, got me some junk, but she missed enough days to get no millions. Flying home tomorrow \o/
---
You're a really bad troll, dude. Like, classic WoW defined the entire genre and was incredibly difficult. It's cookie cutter because everyone copied them. 0/10, try harder.
---
I've found that a consistently good measure of a person's character is how they react to being given free things.
---
Which of the 4 types of space have you lived in most?
---
If the answer is, "high sec," then join Horde and get more PvP experience. That said, I imagine that most of the PvP in HS that isn't null groups fighting over the PLEX market is probably pretty straightforward. Just bring a blob that's within an order or magnitude the size of your enemy's blob and you will never need to fight.
---
After 16 years in eve i have not seen one that have played over 5 years and have managed to quit and not come back, so i recomand you to not biomass or empty your char, just keep it.
---
It’s true but I don’t have to like it.
---
Hugged to death
---
Okay so in that anaology:
---
If you get a netflix subscription, just because of a batman toy give away, and then Netflix tells you "You have 18 days to redeem your free toy."
---
\*insert 19 day wait\*.
---
the "Where the fucks my batman" argument is invalid.
---
&gt; and got totally sloshed.
---
I’ve not gone on many pub crawls and I know why.
---
I did go [on a few](https://imgur.com/1dSwOie) though.
---
The next morning my hair hurt. I had an amazing time but the light of the morning Sun alone was too loud.
---
Goddamn I had so much fun.

Yea, except anyone with a working pair of eyeballs has observed your pattern of conversation is literally shit pot stirring.
---
&gt; The PI'er in me says: NO! The little troll in me screams: YES!

Always krab

When the hell was 12 billion in free so given out? Holy Christ this common core math is horrible. It was 1.25m sp. That is only enough for 2 skill injectors worth, you can't extract half an injector. Injectors are 1b each. This is simple 6 year old math. 1 + 1 = 2. 2 billion not 12. Not even close to 12. Not in the neighborhood of 12. Not in the same star cluster as 12.
---
\^ this. so much this.
---
That and they released a F2P shooter on an EOL platform and didn't port it to anything else.
---
thoughts on expanding your horizons outside of highsec?
---
The distribution of rewards was what was problematic this time. Days 1-15 together are like 700m value together, then day 16 is 2.5b at once.
---
If people had any kind of RL interference that fucked them over massively.
---
I screwed-up past Christmas :(
---
Managed to get them all this time though.
---
I **really** dislike this penalized distribution method.
---
See you on the other side o7
---
Honestly as I welcome a mobile game. My time to play eve has shrunk quite a bit and it makes me sad its hard to stay connected.
---
If your girlfriend was in the hospital, and hence you missed some meaningless Internet prizes on an MMO spaceship game because you presumably put her before said game, it sounds like you had your priorities straight, which is good. Thumbs up for you.
---
Doesn't mean you should get the meaningless Internet prizes anyways.
---
My advice, don't. You will be hunted and targeted
---
[Mfw i read this post](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/687/455/4e5.jpg)
---
I'm never sure about the 'quit and give everything away'. Maybe you'll want to drop in in the future, and you'd like to have that stuff. Good luck IRL and in whatever gaming you choose to do that isn't Eve.
---
That said please consider this a lottery ticket.
---
It totally has been their attitude since we'll forever. They even wrote, produced, and made a music video about it. Goggle it.
---
Congrats on your successes and hopefully you have much more success outside of EVE!
---
I guess that confirms it's a bunch of gank alts.
---
Yes! Shoot me a pm and I will send you the official GSF botting program
---
I haven't played eve since 2008, probably earlier than your birthdate, stay mad.
---
&gt; but the crew on Alien/Aliens got their job and liked their job
---
I don’t need to parse your comment but, if memory serves, the guy in the boiler room of the Nostromo weren’t all that happy with their contract, if memory serves.
---
Other than that I totally agree. They’re building a ship with a specific feature set that is going to require several people to be on board that ship [I don’t know how many exactly but it’s a decent number] and then do stuff like salvaging?
---
You have a module for that in EVE. You drop the salvaging rig, it collects space debris for you to harvest. Thank you. To make -that- into an entire mission, or sequence of missions, honestly, I don’t see that working in practice.
---
I don’t know if that’s how they still do it, but I saw one of their early planetary landing sequences [ripped straight out of Aliens btw], which is a gorgeous landing sequence, it’s beautiful enough. But it takes two minutes. Two fucking minutes. To land on a planet. Do these people understand how hard that sucks to have to do that all the time?
---
EVE doesn’t do that [not going to explain docking/undocking to an EVE pilot] and for obvious reasons. There’s no fun in having to wait for so long. As a sequence it’s awesome. The first time. The third time you have to do that you’re going ‘oh no, not this again’. The 10th time you’re ready to buy a contract on the head of the developer who implemented it.
---
It stated that it ended on the 20th, which it did.
---
You make it sound like the event started in 2004
---
it's ok ill just dock up when i see a neut enter local :)
---
No you are he moron. They said here is a free gift just login and take it. You didn't. Please Google entitlement it might wake you up. You are so far down the entitlement rabbit hole you might run out of oxygen soon if you don't pull up soon.
---
Only 2 bil per month
---
Btw using the term shield slaves may be unwise. There is basically 0% chance of two implants both being titled with the prefix ‘slave’. And so armor slaves would need to be renamed, or shield slaves(ie, shield eho increase by a %.) would need a new prefix.
---
To be fair to CCP, they could have said "Log in any time at all in May and get all the rewards from the event." And on June 1st there would be a post boo-hoo-ing that they couldn't log in from April 30 until June 1st and hOW DaRE ccP DIScrImINAtE aGAiNsT peoPlE WIth LivES?
---
As you give more people free shit, the likelihood of somebody complaining about how the free shit isn't good enough approaches 1.

You ain't getting Eve 2.0 ever
---
Unironic, who?
---
200 bil doesn’t get you far these days for most worthwhile market manipulations.
---
Look, I know this may be hard **but**:
---
Doing something you shouldn't be doing &gt; getting penalized
---
Not doing something you should be doing &gt; not getting rewarded
---
You aren't being penalized for your GF being in the hospital, it caused you to not be able to fulfill the necessary requirements, that were *the same* for everybody, which led to you not getting the reward. Just because your situation was shit doesn't mean you are still entitled to the reward, eventhough you were not able to "click a button like a good monkey". To be quite honest, only needing to be a monkey that clicks a button to get a reward, and you not being able to do that, says more about you than about us.
---
...okay?
---
I think your argument is fairly ridiculous, seeing as how you're comparing EVE (a game with significant history after launch) to Star Citizen (a game that hasn't launched yet).
---
I'm not holding my breath for Star Citizen, but if it launches I'll certainly still be interested in it if I'm even remotely still interested in EVE. Assuming EVE is even alive at that point.
---
&gt; I don’t need to parse your comment but, if memory serves, the guy in the boiler room of the Nostromo weren’t all that happy with their contract, if memory serves.
---
I don't remember specifics except that they wanted a bigger cut if the mission was going to make more money unexpectedly, especially since it was higher risk to the crew and more work. That seems fair but my memory is possibly wrong since I've not seen the movie in years. 
---
Generally speaking I just picked that as an example where the crew wanted things to be nice and safe and boring so they could get back home and spend their paychecks.
---
&gt; The 10th time you’re ready to buy a contract on the head of the developer who implemented it.
---
Dude I've been playing elite:dangerous off and on since launch, and they *finally* implemented an auto-undocking computer as a basic option on all ships, to every player's relief. Prior you had to manually fly your ship through a slot in the side of the station with bigger ships commonly getting "stuck". 
---
At the same time they introduced an "autopilot" for flying between points-of-interest in a system, because some systems are so big that you can spend literally [30 minutes flying from the system-entry location to Hutton Station](https://www.gamerevolution.com/features/14049-a-look-at-the-infamous-outpost-in-elite-dangerous-that-takes-30-minutes-to-fly-to). In Eve we take flying between the sun and a station for granted, because it's way more intense when you have to have your hand on your joystick and throttle the entire time. In E:D it's realistic and gameplay that makes sense, but it's not *fun*. With the new autopilot it's fun again because at least you can go make a sandwich on long hauls.
---
Sometimes the new autopilot will mistake and pancake you against the side of a station, but I do that anyway when I'm drunk flying so no major drawbacks there. It's still way better than manually docking/undocking *again*.
---
I know you might not believe this but the earth really is round. Because it's a huge ass sphere we can't all live next door to one another. So the smart people got together and created timezones. This makes life easy for everyone with a pulse. In the timezone that Eve is developed in the event ended on the 20th. If you live not in that timezone, the vast majority of humans do not, then you need to do a little math and figure it out. Or you can just Google timezones there are a million conversion sites that can work it out for you. Or if you are running a computer made in the last 20 years there is a built in clock you can use.  CCP has made life simple by telling each and every player the current Eve time. You don't even need to login, just open the launcher and there you go.
---
Multiple accounts. Way to show your stupidity.

The rook works very well with selectable damage type and pretty decent dps. It doesn't show on dscan so you can run sites in relative safety. Alternatively you can pvp fit it and blow up people who come to try and run the site you're in if they aren't using combat probes.
---
TIL asking questions you can't answer is trolling
---
sorry i expected too much from you

Imagine having tightass rules for what is supposed to be a celebratory event.
---
Imagine having login events in fucking EvE.

Unspoken were fun adversaries, but unfortunately once goons showed up (whether at your behest or not), the gloves are off for them, and you're caught in the crossfire.

Just when you thought shitposting couldn't get less creative.

The absence of a reward is not a penalty.
---
Wow, I had no idea of that mechanic, that must suck big time.
---
&gt; but I do that anyway when I'm drunk flying so no major drawbacks there.
---
I’m not going to chide you or comment on drunk shenanigans. All reports or claims of the things I may, or may not!, have done while under the influence of an exuberant amount of beer are pure hearsay and slanderous and I will never admit to it in a court of law!
---
I cant believe you are proud of running from a fight, we are deployed on your border and you are running.  Keep up that elite pvp, your members should be proud, hey I hear you kicked a 200 man alliance out of Etherium Reach now there is an accomplishment you can be proud of.
---
Productive response. Really just a great reply. Kudos.
---
Just sayin' that drunk-eve is a bad idea, but drunk-elite is an *extremely* bad idea. 
---
You just wake up floating in space with no fuel and your air running out according to stories I've heard from other people and definitely have not experienced myself multiple times over several weekends in a row.
---
Got that blanket response to a ticket I submitted, and that wasn't even my issue.  I started late, knew I would only get 12 days rewards.  Logged in 9 days in a row roughly the same time of night, 9 pm to 12 am Eastern, with no issues at all.  Logged in on my 10th day, in a row, no claim item button. Submitted my ticket.  36 hours later, I was able to claim my 10th day item, on the 11th day, and the 11th day item on Sunday. So in effect, I was shorted 1 day, due to a glitch in their system. Was not a timing issue, or anything else. I was no where near the "good stuff" at the end, and was not expecting to get it. I just wanted them to fix their glitch on Friday.
---
Looks good for a mobile game. But it's still a mobile game, so I wont be playing it.  I get that it's for a different audience, but it never leaves a good taste in your mouth when the developers spend your money for things the current community doesnt really have any interest in.
---
There was a FC who i remember as a good tactician, but cant remember his Name. FC in Systematic Chaos, 10 years ago- always swearing in italian. Maybe someone remembers
---
\*Looks at 10b wallet\* But... but it's billions...
---
They gave you two extra days. They didn't lie it ended may 20th just like they said. Eve time is a thing and it's how the game is operated. You claim to be a 10 year vet but you haven't heard of Eve time or taken 5 minutes to figure out what time that translates to in your particular timezone? Again that is on YOU.
---
Stop being entitled, take control of your life, and start figuring some shit out. Right now you are losing your shit over a game. What the hell happens when you leave your parents house and enter the real world, dude you are screwed. 
---
Timezones are real and clearly you aren't in the correct one, so goggle it and figure it out. This is something you should have done the first time you saw the Eve clock and realized it didn't match your own
---
Oh you, people including myself speak on this board like within a group of friends. If you are my buddy you bet I'll give you shit for it, and it's all in good faith with each other and we all laugh about it.
---
Our friend OP is merrily replying in the threat and has the confidence and spirit, i doubt OP needs you to whiteknight yourself into hemorrhoids. 
---
Peace out space nerd
---
Now this is spicy
---
For some reason I never got the popup to claim the final reward- despite logging in.
---
I can already imagine the next event:
---
As a lot of people were unhappy with the last event, we reevaluated our rewards versus the time spent. We came to the conclusion that this was massively unbalanced so in the next event you have to
---
-look at the EVE icon on your desktop two seperate times in a period of no more than 790 days
---
And that's it! Rewards include several titan hulls, as well as a few billion SP.
---
&gt; stories I've heard from other people and definitely have not experienced myself
---
An experienced and responsible space pilot doesn’t get caught making newbie mistakes ;-).
---
That’s something I believe they did right in EVE: no worries about air running out, no worries about the ship not having enough fuel [other than opening jump gates]. And they were right because that’s not what it’s supposed to be about.
---
It has a room in a live physics environment, sure, but in EVE that’s not the important part.
---
In EVE it’s important to stick with the fleet, and not wake up when they are 20 jumps ahead of you while you’re sitting in a system that is now loaded with reds. Not that I would know that, of course... But you hear stories, as you do, of people getting caught that way. Yes, that’s my official statement.
---
This ... exactly ... everything in eve if it has something to do with a reset or renew of something usually comes together with "downtime" ... if anyone would have logged on at any of the other 16 days he would have figured out that something wasn't there before downtime and suddenly after downtime it was ...
---
CCP sent a mass mail to deal with player entitlement.
---
If people are actually quitting the game over 1mil SP- They were a small nudge from quitting anyway.
---
As a RZR member I support that.
---
So supers and titans aren't important any more. Got it.
---
Life is hard dude. You can't please everybody. Seriously you can't. CCP gave a 2 day window but had they given 80 there would still be people who screwed around missed it and cried grrrr CCP. 
---
Just take the free gift you didn't earn, say thank you, and be greatful they gave you anything at all. They didn't have to give you anything yet they did don't piss on their leg over it.
---
You had more than enough time to get the rewards
---
Stop fucking whining.

Eve was released before WoW but w/e

It's understandable ... absolutely NOBODY was interested in that game ... really 0 people ... UNLESS you own a PlayStation, then suddenly you felt the  urge to play Dust ... sell the PS and boom not in the mood for Dust anymore ... they knew that ... that's why it made no sense to bring it to the PC, nobody ever would have played it ... waste of money
---
dude pls. i can't find any FW corps. i must be looking in the wrong places. gallente specifically.
---
Check back in and let us know how it is on the outside o7
---
Why do the days matter were talking about whether it's free or not can you literally not read?
---
Last time you were whining about this you said you were on track to get the rewards and were just defending others... Sounds like that was a lie and you're still just salty because mom pulled the plug to the router and wouldn't let you on.
---
Bro there's this thing called TeamViewer. It's free and you can use it to access your desktop on your phone. All you had to do was go to character select and click a button.
---
Did CCP break your mom's arm? Did hey make you produce children? Did they make you a single parent? 
---
Your circumstances are not CCP's responsibility. Just take the free gift you didn't earn, say thank you, and be greatful they gave you anything at all. They didn't have to give you anything yet they did don't piss on their leg over it.
---
It actually is quite productive. Next time there is an event, you will know it is from DT to DT. CCP doesn't have to say it because everyone should know, and since you seem to have missed the memo, now you are caught up.
---
&gt;diligently downvoting any posts about the huge titan force that moved up north.
---
Is it that? Or is it the fact that the method used to get this huge titan force is retarded and slowly rots the game from the inside?
---
&gt;Is Panfam really that scared that they won't even try to fight for their space?
---
You call it scared, we call it "not feeding supers and titans in a slugfest we can't win".
---
&gt;Is the reddit spin enough to keep your member morale up so they will keep playing despite being evicted?
---
No, but burning goonie krabbers in Delve while they grind through empty structures is.
---
&gt;What happened with your pride Panfam?
---
So what is it? Should we adapt to the meta and play the smart or should we stick to our pride and feed all our shit for no reason?
---
&gt;What happened with your super fleet? 
---
Safely out of reach from goons.
---
Unspoken is dead, and we have killed them. Who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there to clean ourselves?
---
See, what a helpful response. But instead you had to escalate with some typical edgelord "I fear for your future". Just because our sides shoot each other doesn't mean you need to be a cunt.
---
It's still only about 5 bill tops per toon. Just because you have multiple toons doesn't mean everyone is claiming 12B+ in free skill points. If this meant so much to you then you probably should have been there for it.
---
the ceo of final ultimatum, duh
---
I love the idea that the ap will fuck up like that :) we need this in eve. Accidentally in ec-p8r instead of torrinos

And then? Are they going to fight an empty patch of space in Venal? Or Geminate? Imagine how fun it would be if we had left all those structures up. And fought dirty over each and every one of them. We would still loose, but it would take possibly in excess of a year to clear all that shit. Imagine morale after grinding structures that you always may or may not get blueballed on, gor more than a year.
---
If there was a period when the servers were indeed down and it was entirely CCP's doing then yes they should make it right. But anything beyond their control is beyond their control and not their job to fix.
---
My internet provider crashed my service for 3 days last month. Life without the internet sucked I was forced to talk to my family. It was a fucking nightmare. I also lost 3 days of Eve play on all my Omega accounts that I paid for. But when my isp fixed their shit I didn't bitch at CCP about my missed 3 days of play time and demand they extend my Omega time. It wasn't their problem to fix.
---
sorry, your elite pvp brain is interfering.  They are important if they are deployed if they are not they are worthless, did not think I would have to break it down for you.
---
Congrats on winning Eve dude. No one ever really quits though.
---
No, that still applies. The fact that you didn't already know it ran from DT to DT makes me question your ability to apply logic or reason to much of anything. Since this might be too much for you, I think you are stupid for needing to be told this.
---
I just didn't think you would get it on a second pass, since we have already established your inability to take a hint, so I skipped it on the second time it was pointed out.
---
Perhaps third time is a charm?
---
a HS "Merc" CEO who has his head shoved so far up his ass that scientists mistake his intestinal tract for a Möbius strip.  This individual is on par with Texas Law levels of stupidity.
---
Does this mean there's hope for a fight?
---
Friends don't let friends drunk titan bridge
---
Ccp is so dumb. They make eve-lite for phones when really all the people want is actual eve on our phones!
---
&gt; first day of move ops
---
When was that?
---
Sir i see you are having a stroke have some QUAFE and relax.
---
Our great leader Vince Draken is up there with the best of them.
---
I appreciate this humor. I don't understand the hurf blurf about having to participate. It's literally a very important part of null life at every level
---
It's definitely a bug, like the AP can't do the math to plot a route to the destination. The results are hilarious except for the whole process of converting your ship into a fireball.
---
'glassed'?
---
“Scientists mistake his intestinal tract for a mobius twist” this is the most intelligent insult I’ve ever heard, take that upvote 😂😂😂
---
Ccp really just needs to put eve on our phones. If I could log in on my phone and mine/mission/trade it would be awesome.
---
They could open up eve to a massive world of phone users.
---
Instead they want to do eve-lite 2.0.
---
gotta save muh killboard
---
3rd!
---
Think about it this way: if you've got the reward and kept playing, you could lose those skillpoints by losing level 5 subsystem skills multiple times in the future. But now you won't because you quitting.
---
It's an 8 not a B please forgive
---
Thank you for this post. I was so worried you might be a goon.
