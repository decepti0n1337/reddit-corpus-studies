ACs or Rapid LMLs.
---
---
---
nonsense is the 6 hour strat ops, one after another, that get nothing done or at best some trivial bullshit structure blown up for reasons. "fun!"
---
Having played through crap like BCs online there were very viable counters to them, they just happened to be the most cost effective ship for the job. Supers online exists in a bubble where there are two viable comps, supercap spam or 100+ bombers/harpies/kikis with a wing of booshers - neither of which are fun to fight.
---

---
BCs, Ishtars and T3Cs online were never that oppressive at a small scale - nobody really would from a 30+ man prot fleet for a few nano shits but forming a nyx or two is laughably easy.
---
I personally want to "retire FW missions in place" by massively nerfing the LP payout until some resources for a total rework can be allocated.
---
I used to run a small JF operation for a smaller group.  High-five!
---
I don't have a strong opinion either way on the no-maintenance supercaps, but it'd definitely be an interesting change if keepstars charged rent for every docked supercap and impounded them if the owner didn't pay up.
---
This would be stellar. Although driving 4 hours.from northern Minnesota is most likely not happening for me
---
More like FUCK YES TWINKIES!!!
---
You're forgetting a few things.
---
First, the industrial part of the game, which CCP made extremely difficult to move.
---
So no, the blocs would not just move.  They'd do a crop-rotation-like thing where they ratted like crazy in one area while keeping other areas fallow so that they recover.  Because they can't move their industry.
---
Second, if you're trying to get people out of the blocs, making the blocs move is a terrible way to do it.  Because you leave players with the options of 1) constantly getting stomped into the ground by a bloc, or 2) joining a bloc.
---
&gt; Do you also believe that it's "Everyone versus everyone"? And that it's a future dystopia?
---
I absolutely love how, in this supposed libertarian wet dream of a universe, it's the socialist empires that dominate.
---
&gt; if you put different resources in different parts of space, I can bet you my left nut there will be people hitting convoys transporting goods. 
---
Unfortunately for your left nut, we already have this.  Ice and top-end moongoo are limited to different parts of the map.
---
Need all factions to agree farmers will swap to cal gal warzone
---
Then somewhere else will be Jita.  After all, Jita wasn't always the big trade hub.
---
I’d love to see pirat bring a good fight. Someone commented they put the fort there for one yet they bring arty nado’s..
---
I never cease to be amused that, in this supposed libertarian wet dream, the socialist empires won, because it turns out that funding your footsoldiers lets them fight longer.
---
As a former jf pilot of many years, go figure it out. Im not gona dime them out.
---
Wont they just death clone to station and accept mission? Undock and warp to citidel  ship up and  complete it.. once done just death clone back... it adds to the process but still...
---
In theory they could pull 3 missions with each alt : drop npc corp, enter station, jump to next station, death clone to last station. And then indeed death clone again.
---
But then the op aspect of FW missions was to chain accept a whole bunch of missions and chain blitz them. Death cloning will indeed work but only for one mission at a time.
---
As they should...  since the ideas come from a 10 man echo chamber.
---
This is an awesome initiative, all my respect.
---
I'll share this with the rest of Stay Frosty, we may very well use our staging in the Amarr/Matari warzone to add to the (hopefully) rising pvp content in the area and support this proyect the only way we know, with explotions!
---
look for a newbro friendly mining corp. theyll have orca links (increases efficiency) and will haul ore back to base for you (more time mining). just keep an eye open, and make sure theyre good people! get paid for your ore!
---
I literally don't know anyone with one account. This guy's smoking actual meth
---
Now if you really want to make it stick, just see if any bored nullsec entities will provide f1 numbers.
---
PS - if you are really courageous you would do gallante/caldari
---
(i also bet a number of people behind this agreement have ample supplies of both minmatar and amarr FW LP, in the order of several months worth of supply)
---
Only if you assume jetcan mining.
---
Siege Green Was in Amarr FW before, they had a few Amarr FW alt corps after Siege Green went Neutral/Pirate  
---
We just created an alliance and put the alt corps inside and set a few more objectives.
---
Free SP like this is amazing for training non-mapped skills though.  Keep training your 2700 SP skills, but use free SP on ones that would be 1800.
---
can you make it longer im sat on about 15 to 20m lp for each factiom
---
Unfortunately we don't decide for our gallente/caldari colleagues.
---
And yes FW players have stockpiles of LP. Until now Amarr was high tier and us low tier. Amarr LP market crashed.
---
The usual circle would have : Minmatar already cashed out their LP because their tier was low and prices high. Amarrs stockpiled waiting for tier to drop. Farmers switch to Minmatar for better isk/lp. Pendulum switch in favor of Minmatar.
---
That's a well discplined bot.
---
No, the curse is deceptive, you want it to b good cause it looks cool and sounds great, but its fat, slow, unbelievably thin, and weak.
---
Pilgrim also looks Federation, but it doesn't care about the Treaty of Algeron b/c it can Cloak. =)
---
I don't think the kind of thing you're describing is something we've had since respawning anomalies started being a thing.  Also, it's significantly obviated by separating your combat character from your farmer character, because why have a commute when you can just work remote?  Injectors make separating those two easier than ever.
---
AFAICT, the large empires of old were large because of the moons.  Once you had the moons, you had to figure out what to do with the space, so you might rent it out, but the high-end moons were why you defended it.  You complain about empires not taking up enough space, but I'm not convinced that the old way was better.  You're just as likely to see a bored empire trample random upstarts into the dust now as you did then, but... back then, they wouldn't have had any space in the first place, because, to get it, they'd have had to claw it away from someone or another's moon empire.
---
I guess I'm having trouble figuring out what you're really looking for, and the best I've got is that it sounds like going back to the days that belt ratting and belt mining were the only ratting and mining.  (... which is so long ago that I have a decade on my main and it isn't something I really remember.)
---
The stratios is a better pick for the same role tbh.
---
Respect the shit out of this. Good on you guys for putting aside your differences and taking action.
---
Go with a stratios my dude. Better tank dps and bonuses to explo.
---
What ad
---
OH MY GOD
---
What's stopping them from pulling missions in the HiSec hubs? Most runners I know pull out of HiSec for exactly the reason of system ownership. But good job driving more players from the already mostly dead FW area of space, bravo.
---
For someone who leaves under the rock, could you please comment:
---
0. Is this another shitpost or something real?
---
1. Is this driven by CCP or players/community. I assume 2nd, but did not know this is possible technically.
---
2. Is this happening? Above people wrote "no", then... this is just a shitpost?
---
P. S. No trolls plz.
---
P. P. S. I know they'll troll anyway
---
lol just go to nullsec, land of the carebear
---
To fly the ishtar. They make more off rmt in an hour of subscription
---
This! The only reason I don’t fw is because it’s a pain in the butt to do anything else then. And get rid of the war dec. and allow me to be in fw while in another Corp.
---
500plex doesn't equal 1b isk though. So they are saving even less then that. According to the prices above 1b isk of plex from ccp costs around $7
---
If they leave then you won by the "I just want them to go away" metric then you can do whatever you consider fun, you either care about the isk or you don't, if you're a poor I can see how this is a problem but if you are a poor why are you trying to defend a system when you can't afford 40 shitfit thoraxes?
---
Win or lose I'd rather fight than just log off but I'm clearly in the minority. :p
---
Whoops, forgot I had that unofficial addon for cloud2butt running :(
---
&gt;can some one explain why they are doing it
---
Spite. They're mad that other people are playing the game "*the wrong way*", aka not *their* way, according to their own bullshit made up bushido.
---
I'm gonna laugh when CCP adds Amarr *and* Minmatar agents to all the stations to prevent this type of coordinated griefing, and the ~ELITE PVPERS~ whine for 10 more years.
---
FW is already dead, this will just hasten it's final demise.
---
or you go super hard for a few months, RMT out on a weekly basis, and when you get banned you already have another set of alpha accounts waiting for you.
---
*&lt;keels over in hysterical laughter&gt;*
---
I mean c'mon dude it's not rocket science. [You check the dps values of the waves](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17cNu8hxqJKqkkPnhDlIuJY-IT6ps7kTNCd3BEz0Bvqs/pubhtml#) and then you make a fit that can tank that number in pyfa.
---
Moongoo can be alchemised so that's not really an issue and ice is even in high sec so not sure how it's limited to part of a map
---
So fucking Goons actually won? No more pandemic legion, northern coalition, red alliance and else?!
---
Can't take shots if everything around you is blue.
---
Reminder: Im gay
---
Take your updoot
---
Depends on what you enjoy doing, but it's not a goal I would recommend to anyone new.
---
Obviously I don't know how they've got their event handlers set up but it seems like a relatively easy thing to do from the perspective of a developer looking from the outside.
---
I always thought it was kinda sad each race didn't have a light cruiser type like the Stabber, though I suppose T3Ds are in that role now.
---
Players taking action in the game- Instead of just "CCPLZ" on reddit. 10/10
---
Unless im missing something major, I think its better if CCP and TQ are swapped. CCP inviting Serenity come come diddle the old broken down players of TQ in the poop chute while TQ players can only watch and accept their fate.
---
just remove them then or make some change "Destroy a lv5 Ihub" "Destroy a citadel" something like that not just crap pve
---
Not since Vile Rat is gone :/
---
Whew that's a relief, I only studied in rocket surgery
---
Lowsec is the realm of non-consensual PVP, wtf are you even talking about?
---
Back when I lived in Low-Sec, I didn't bother with any Jackdaws that showed up because there were only tqo situation when I ever encountered one which wasn't running a mission. One of those situations was in Tama, so I expected it to be looking for a fight. They were too slippery to engage and they wouldn't bother me when I was doing any sort of PVE stuff to pay for the many ships that I lost.
---
Most FWers I know (and I know a lot), just run a few missions in order to be able to afford to PvP. They may use alts or may use their mains. I would argue they are the majority of mission runners. So, out of some misguided need to spite a small group of players who were "playing the game wrong", you've just driven a lot of content from your area of space. Good job.
---
&gt; make your pvp more attractive 
---
  As someone who's pvp'd in FW sov for years- It is already more attractive than nullsec in various ways:
---
 Newbie? Stick to novice sites.
---
  Combat is concentrated within 20km sphere deadspace sites, with one gate to get in. 
---
  Most fights are dessie/frig- Great for people to get the hang of tackling/brawling/kiting before graduating to faction/cruisers/ and up.
---
[See here for a list of banned scams.](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Scams_in_EVE_Online#Forbidden.2Fbannable_actions)
---
We've actually contacted a few nullsec groups to ask for help when it comes to controlling rebellious groups who do not follow the treaty. Gives null content with citadel explosions and keeps us in lowsec happy with this agreement
---
&gt; What we are doing is the FW equivalent of asking Null Sec alliances to voluntarily unanchor their keepstars to fight super proliferation. 
---
That's cute.
---
All they got was 3 sabres? What a bunch of scrub tier shitlords.
---
Really wish the people who are abusing these systems cared enough about the health of the game to stop.
---
I’ve been decloaked before by effing up on my safe before. Wasn’t wanting to lose my strat less than 30 min after getting it. 
---
However solid advice and I did have a cloak.
---
You are right so I'll just make the point: he's a little bitch.
---
The first fish to fry has to be botting. Which is significantly more disruptive to the game than most admit or believe. Obviously ccp won't do that. But if they did...
---
Large blobs need to be discouraged. How the best way to do this is out of my wheel house. But it has to happen.
---
People need to pay upkeep on big shit. From cap up and all shit anchored in space.
---
Holding large amounts of are needs to be deincentivized.
---
Large blocks need to be looked at since they have been the beginning of the actual end. I mean, shit, force a version of the stock system to be utilized at Corp and alliance levels. Can you imagine the endless entertainment that would spark?
---
The entire game needs to be redone at this point with a careful eye on what made eve 1 become so boring and hopelessly static.
---
/&gt;handmade isk
---
&gt;Mission runners never give us content anyways
---
You have no idea how wrong you are. Maybe they don't give you content *while* they're running missions, but so what?
---
When the people organizing this "mission blockade" realize that it's had the *opposite* effect of what they wanted^1, remember I told you so.
---
1. Probably the real intent is to for them to starve the LP market so they can gain financially. Not surprising given it's EVE.
---
Artillery tornadoes are too fragile and have too abysmal of tracking to fire more than one shot at a target.
---
Autocannon tornadoes are out-performed by all three other attack battlecruisers.
---
The one place at present where Tornadoes function reliably is in gank scenarios where a group of tornadoes can 1-shot kill lone enemies coming in, and then either die to CONCORD or sit and wait for the next target (with no other risk of being backstabbed and dying before getting to fire their shot).
---
you're still locked in place, it's just that the rest of eve is moving
---
very fast
---
Oof my bad
---
Good to see data sites getting looked at. I still do them out of habit but plenty of explorers don't even bother fitting a data analyzer anymore. I'd rather they normalize the value of cans a bit rather than adding more jackpot items but both would raise isk/hr hopefully to the point that they're viable again.
---
Hate Triglavians? Think they should die horrible painful deaths? Join Marlo industry’s your one stop shop for triglavian genocide.  Tell them xeno sent you
---
The thing is that is your opinion. But the big blocks disagree. And they are, well, big. I don’t think CCP are ever going to be convinced to actively go against big blocks because they’ll fight them with unsubs. Not possible (or arguably healthy) to go against the majority here.
---
A better approach is incentivize conflict and make small block life easier.
---
Supercaps ruined the game.
---
You dont have to be sneaky most of fw space is empty af.
---
no, something that *works*
---
Genius move, I hope it works out for you guys!
---
Yeah fuck you pvper scum you'll have no more instawarp jackdaws to hunt now
---
I like my name too much.
---
LoL, would resub just to watch anthro and his boys mess you up.
---
So... now I can make an Isk printer alt in Gallente/caldari … ah, thanks for the advice
---
Hmmm..... Maybe it's time to resub... Could be fun
---
"...but I poop from there :("
---
You have a very myopic mentality.
---
You drive off those "instawarp jackdaws" with this mission blockade and you'll find the content in the area, which was being funded by those "instwarp jackdaws", dries up even further. Good luck and have fun with turning FW into even more of a content desert.
---
I'll still do my 4 missions/day out of the HiSec like I always do, but I'll be taking my PvP elsewhere. And I'll enjoy reading the whining in a few months. That'll be gold.
---
The issue is that there is a major benifit to abuse mechanics, in general humans will go to where the benifit is. It takes people like these to stop that.
---
Well back in the days where moon mining the R64s and renting out the useless sov you essentially had a hard cap on how many members you could sustain, disincentiving the strength in numbers playstyle since you had to split the income with more people.
---
The `commute` issue is also less about the commute for the miner or ratter but more about the commute that the `police` need to do. If you can have everyone working across the road from the world's biggest police station there's no surprises that you can't do much in the ways of disrupting them.
---
I don't really care about smaller groups owning sov, I more so care that there are objectives to do within sov - besides slapfights with your neighbors.
---
Those daws are typically alts from non fw players but ok
---
Artisanal rmt, fuck me.
---
My man, if you check the numbers for excavator kills you can easily see a massive spike. Like 500% or what was it? That was done by cloaky ships. Most people I saw roaming around did it in cloaky ships.
---
Now, does this mean that everyone was only flying cloaky ships? By no means. Does this mean that a shitton flew cloaky ships simply because they were massively OP in a no local environment? It sure does. People will always go the easiest route for the maximum gain, its human nature. Thats why cloaky ships were used in such abundance.
---
And Ive never said no local is a bad thing. Instead I said it needed balance, if you for instance remove cloaks and d-scan immunity then atleast there is a counter. Because this was what caused the BO to fail, lack of counters.
---
Will you stop creating strawmen and then beating them up. It gets old fast.
---
This.
---
And for multiple reasons I can think of. But you can definitely scare the shit out of some wormholers with a Curse, but just on a roam, no pve.
---
Standings required.
---
&gt;We've kinda wrung dry most of the sources we could hope for.
---
Have you tried unblueing people?
---
FW was the best pvp and the most fun Eve had to offer.  I hope this works!
---
Your conception of good money is about to be radically altered.
---
It's on the Internet, it has to be real
---
Where's the betrayal and sabotage that eve is known for when you need it?
---
Look up the tragedy of the commons.
---
Tldr; it's in each individuals' best interest to get as much out of the system as they can but if they all get all they can than all their efforts are wasted.
---
&gt;Having 4 people online at that time is above average.
---
Then join another corp :), If you tell me your TZ i can recommend some great WH corps that are actually active.
---
Players want to blame anyone but themselves for creating an ecosystem where fun has been optimized out if the game.
---
This new ways clearly better. 
---
The subcaps are so squishy, it make sense for the supers to jump in first and make sure it's safe for the newbro in a Harpy.
---
I'd rather fight versus a similar fleet but that carries too much risk, better drop 20 supers
---
i quit eve long ago and FW even longer before that but i approve of what all you guys are doing. good luck and i hope you guys are successful.
---
IFW &amp; Late Nite 4 Life
---
It looks Kinda star trek-esqye, but what it really looks like is a Vasudan ship from freespace.
---
They would be sooo much easier for ccp to catch.
---
Yes. Bombers are still used sometimes but jackdaws are where its at
---
We learned that Merk is the high sec pubbie of our hearts.

So a game streaming service?
---
Inb4 'Goonswarm Civil War 2020'
---
Poor gankbears had to pvp when trying to kill miners. 
---
Eve is dead
---
Most of eve has rules and policies now, but good try.
---
We live in a society, societies have rules, if those rules aren't enforced society collapses.
---
Wow so if I have a perfect hulk trained pilot with a transport alt, would that make more, not sure of the differences between the covetor and the hulk
---
Has nothing to do with docking titans
---
People still do FW
---
&gt; GF P I R A T
---
The acronym is particularly appropriate, because from what I’ve gathered on Uni comms most people turned up to see P I R A T Get Fucked.
---
\*sees top damage\*
---
Well, that's his login quota for the year.
---
Why dont you just fuck off than?
---
FW could be so much better than it currently is. They really need to make it so you have to fit real ships or even fleet up to do the missions though, not gimmick ships.
---
All I got out of this post was "fuck people for being humans and doing what humans do; build tribes."
---
uh, no it doesn't.
---
That's a curious way to let yourself save face when confronted with what happened.
---
You seem to misunderstand the CSMs roll... they aren't a decision making body.  
---
They don't have control, they aren't approving anything... it's a presentation and feedback session. It's a focus group.
---
I agree, more risk and balance the reward for it. To me was sad to see the end of blackout.

The must read for novice plex warfare is : [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z7dkJrFiKZo4w\_xVgJSmWCUyvKQ8Ha8Q/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z7dkJrFiKZo4w_xVgJSmWCUyvKQ8Ha8Q/view)
---
About blinged pirate frigate just deny them content. They will let you alone.
---
As for regular plexing ( aka not running away neither going full death wish), pick a ship which fits you and stick to it. Usually if you take a kiting ship ( hookbill/breacher/navy slicer etc) people will think twice before entering the plex and give you the high ground.
---
Also don't worry : we all suck at pvp before getting good ( or less bad at least XD).
---
Fuck off dude
---
What happens if I undersize the AB? 
---
What happens if I fit multiple ABs?
---
I think just reducing Siege speed reduction by 20%/level is more workable. Disable MWD during Siege if that's a concern.
---
Whadya mean “just deny them content”?
---
Anyway, usually I use a neut-drone Tristan; works well, but still gets shit on by all these blingy bois and such; best I can usually do is make them sweat a little
---
Everyone had been crying about local for years, CCP does something and the river of tears flowing from Krabs put a stop to it.
---
Perhaps we can have something like 10 second local delay.
---
man, if they wanna make cash? Just make a lite eve client for mobile, where you play the actual EVE game itself on a UI adapted to mobile.
---
Neut Tristan is good choice since most people expect a kiting Tristan. Only thing it doesn't work against all fits and you give up the possibility of escape usually bestowed to kiting ships.
---
By "deny them content", I mean just warp to a safe and then come back to the plex once they leave. They will usually come back too but will soon give up if you keep doing it and consider you are not worth their time.
---
No idea. Did that one fleet and decided that it wasn't worth the effort.  More actions per minute required than VNI ratting, less safe b/c everyone knows you are mining and if they cloak up in system you can't just move over or go afk for half an hour, and not any more isk except on the very good moons which are even less safe. 
---
Now that you have to rat in a myrm/domi/ishtar, the equation might have changed a bit, but I'm not in null anymore so I haven't bothered figuring it out.
---
Synda is hot They even have daddy Progod as a bonus
---
No

Belonged to someone that got kicked by his corp.

It's like poor people. You know they exist but you only start caring when you take a different route to work and drive through the slums.
---
Just give it a week or two and people will go back to not-caring
---
Honestly I didn’t know about the pve until like a year after running pve sites. So many ships lost...
---
You are in a hive mind alliance, what did you expect.
---
God forbid somebody shoots the other one to slow them down, right?
---
Wow... the fact that I was in FW for years and never did one pve mission both makes me sad for the wasted time and proud at the 1-5 win-loss ratio in the pvp to pirates and not FW
---
Unless you burn the whole region to the ground any loss is a non-issue for the alliance
---
but i if i haven't got a reason to log in to begin with, i haven't got a reason to stay logged in after i've got my 10k sp.

As a long time test member, i dont like our foreign policy either. Lets reset and get a good damn scrap goin'  i might resub

sounds totally american to me... it used to be all russians fault, now its the chinese xD eve cant escape real life
---
Thanks for sharing then and supporting the initiative :)
---
My poster was vouched by leadership when posted in the Discord but i was still waiting for the green light from both leaderships to post the text going with it on Reddit.
---
its not that easy, the reason amarr-minma warzone worked great for lvl4 farming, was because of they ewar, in cal-gal u have ecm and damps which will fuck you a bit more
---
He was ratting while in a op? Ratting with hotdroppers in local? What?
---
What's the requirement to place an Athanor?? not for moon mining only ore processing....  
---
I just want to be able to compress ore at hi-sec system where i hang out and make it public too, because there is no public facilities that does it...
---
It tickled, didn't it?
---
every exploded cap makes the game a tiny bit better, doesn't matter who's popping them

That’s part of fixing it?

I mean what you said was a distortion of what happened and actual facts.

Maybe then you wouldn't be broke? XD
---
A sotiyo in Delve belonged to a corp who's CEO decided to hand it to NC after getting kicked. It was then made available to everyone not Goons.

This isn't Conman. I thought you quit. 😑

He fed dreads into a supwrblob once I hear. One at a time 😄
---
I've had to deal with your kind at work. The actual effect inevitably turns out to be: lots of meetings on how to hold better meetings, followed by more meetings discussing why the first meetings didn't help us improve the quality of our meetings. The end result being no improvements, but a lot of pointless meetings.
---
I wish people would just shut up and let me get on with my work.
---
Good luck!         
---
Can you add to the list lowsec gate to Stain?         
---
I want to my region to be alive again and not filled with alts running burner missions.
---
Drop another.
---
Technology isn’t allowed in the room thanks to Brisc
---
Then drop raitaru or astrahaus especially if you don't need capitals to dock.
---
Yea, if this was maybe a few years ago I could see them using it as a buzzword, but at this point if you start throwing around “cloud” if better be something that’s not traditionally handled client side and is highly scaleable on standard server stuff.
---
So I was trying to figure their pitch.
---
For each anomaly cleared in the last hour in system, delay appearance in local 1 second.
---
Wat
---
&gt; If I had a dollar for every time some “management coach” tried to tell me how I could be running my business more efficiently... 
---
... you would probably be so rich that your business is not your main source of income anymore :P
---
Same goes for most of the people whos business is telling people how to run their business.
---
In a world without IRC and Discord, you might log in to kill your daily tutorial rat but stay logged in because you realize your guildmates are online and doing stuff. I wouldn't be surprised if applies to a lot of casual players.
---
He is a business coach, no humor required for that job.
---
They pay before you tell them, so probably yes.
---
Depends.
---
People who's job it is to learn and teach how to run businesses will understand how to run businesses better than people whose job it is to do other things.
---
Much like and English teacher knows more about the English language than someone that just speaks it.
---
I mean if you don't want to follow the rules that help make Delve what it is and you can't even bother to pay attention to the fits that pinged 6 times a day, maybe Goonswarm isn't for you?

Have done this, can confirm its nerve-startling and thrilling a bit every time.

Sure they know  how to run a business in theory, the difference is how well they can apply that to reality.
---
To use your example: Take an English teacher from Germany and watch him trying to teach English to someone from China.
---
Actually the design isn't as bad as you make it out to be. It isn't necessarily great, but it isn't a dumpster fire either. The Alliances are the worst part of the game since they break every system they come in contact with.
---
Pretty sure these days you need to do either something with "the cloud" or "artificial intelligence" to look cool.
---
Wrong rigs.
---
Yeah, I've had several. Two of them got blown up just recently, a Vigilant and a Deimos. Both like 12 years old. The former was called "In Memoriam Fountain" because I bought it from there and flew it out solo mostly unfitted in a a nerve-wracking trip, while the latter was "Corpse Wagon" because I liked to collect frozen corpses with it during roams.  
---
Of the ones that remain, I suppose at the top of the list there's the retired "Old Warhorse" Dominix which has 60+ kill participations from back in the day when I went onto fleet ops with it.
---
I agree with no vision part, i dont rly care about coaching part. Part with jumping around with topic is right as well, they should focus on problems.
---
I like how you pulled the i am a diplomat and thus i am superior to all, card. The rules are for all. 
---
You knew it and chose to put your self entitlement above the rest. You got what you deserved.
---
The only good reason to go full cloud (which is kind of like going full retard tbh) is control of the platform on which it runs for security. 
---
There's a laundry list of bad reasons tho. And if it's not for security the most common is that people think the cloud is some magical place where all your shit is and think its more impressive than it actually is.
---
Get the fuck OUTTTTTTTTT
---
Tears and refine to salt
---
Here's hoping someone doesn't biomass yourself.
---
Injectors.
---
No, go away
---
Did you even read it?
---
It's ex CCP employees, not current ones.
---
CITADELS ARE TOO CHEAP TOO
---
You don't have to worry about that. If they get more expensive, less people will use them and cheaper ships become viable.
---
They're the good kind
---
Where's the best place to run l5's? They're lowsec only I assume? May have to put a char in a lowsec corp and try em out.
---
Still gotta find and communicate with someone else. Maybe you decide to go out and do something proper after.
---
Hell try making a team of 12 work by a protocol to enhance efficiency and clarity. Even if they all agree it is needed, you are never going to get everybody work in the same way.
---
You're a retard.
---
This is just you being a moron on a different sub.
---
I think the reason was they didn't want your help.
---
I have questions. How do you lose sniper Tornados in highsec? Why didn't you use Nagas? Or Oracles?
---
CCP don't want to  remove mining rorqual and will remove all those supers and capitals that people injected into and got the hulls.       
---
Imagine yourself the effect this will have on all the people that paid CCP to get into them.            
---
Blackout costed CCP a lot of subs now imagine the effect when CCP remove the hulls.       
---
Like the whole issue with capitals is that **almost every one injected into them**.
---
I think you wanted to say Panic.
---
&gt; Why don't you play anymore? Why are you then so busy with EVE?
---
 He's busy *professionally coaching people*!
---
&gt;I mean if you don't want to follow the rules
---
Goons, Rules. One , not both. Like I said, y'all a cultural shadow of your former selves, but everyone is tbh. Melting pot vs a mosaic.
---
This is a dumb idea.
---
It's one of the best (if not the best) brawling AFs mate.
---
Never get post like this. If caps are so cheap, get a dread/super/titan catch and fish for unprepared rorq/ratting super response fleets.  You get your fights killing cheap caps with cheap caps.
---
If it's their job to directly work with the company to improve operations...then they know the reality. It isn't just theoretical.
---
If you come in as a lean-six sigma consultant, at the high level certificates you have to have real world experience applying the principles.
---
Let's expand on your example, by also limiting the course to University level courses for Intermediate and above learners, not school age children.
---
open your eyes retard

Just a number...

The mobile version is a separate universe. No basis in current new eden.
---
You're an actual moron.
---
Rather than sperging like an incoherent child, go back and read the conversation thread.
---
Your initial response indicated botting, and various transgressing activities, were some kind of new phenomenon. They aren't. You've already conceded this point yourself.
---
You've then gone on to agree with my point on the harm being driven by demand for the good. I never indicated that it is or is not worse than it was previously, that's a fallacy you've insinuated. I simply said you'd need to look at the price movement data to be sure. All I really said was literally everything in your little shopping list of transgressions has happened before and the new flavour of it is Chinese players.
---
Remind me: how exactly is the botting situation with Chinese players worse than how the botting situation would have been at Russian peak (Darius Johnson and Team Security were implemented specifically for this stuff by the way c.2012) when a significantly greater proportion of those players existed in the game at the time? You need only bother to look back at bot banning history to see how significant the problem was in the Russian alliances had been and how many characters have been banned, vs. how many Chinese have been banned (though accepted the latter is still work in progress).
---
And I'm picking on the Russians but really, the problem existed in a hell of a lot of communities in the past, and one of the big drivers was the easy passive income via tech moons, etc., that used to really concentrate high wealth in the game. RMT was big game before botting ever was.
---
that's kinda half the problem - there's a whole lot of bugger all going on these days.
---
I can comfortably let you know that just about every management consultant I've come across has been full of shit and are still full of theory despite having worked with various groups.
---
Attributing net fiscal change in businesses to culture changes is like saying you performed better on a specific day in sport because the weather and humidity is just right; it may certainly have played a part, but there are a hell of a lot of other factors in play too.
---
Our group managing director used to love getting new ones in to give talks and provide tips all the time; Lean Six Sigma, GTD, Agile, just to name a few. The net uptake was mediocre and more than anything, it promoted a culture of people giving things a touch just to keep them moving, rather than actually making material progress on projects.
---
Ultimately it always fell to a few people who specialized in making projects move to identify those and get them moving. Ironically the blocked pipes methodology is another management school of thought.
---
it doesnt change his point from being right, the one thing he missed is the peanut gallery of non mixex expertise thats in that room. You dont have a mix of all the different aspects of eve. You have a gaggle of the most popular assholes in eve with maby 3 views out of 15 regarding the different playstyles and professions in eve. Missing most likely about 70% of the population due to lack of proper representation.
---
I always cringe when i see pvp lords talking about industrial or mining or mission changes as if they have done any of that shit in the past 5 fucking years. CSM was created as a community oversight due to top level corruption, and has evolved into a popularity contest to get insider information and for fcs to give thier 2 cents on subjects they arnt qualified to give opinions on.
---
[removed]
---
Not that I necessarily disagree with your point, but your random capitalisation makes you look like a BOOMER.
---
FW is the perfect place for the diamond NPC AI. The respective NPC factions launch random attacks on neighboring enemy systems and send faction diamond NPC fleets to attack the enemy Sov. And the capsule pilots have to support them or help their own NPC to fight them. For this you get a bounty and LP. These attacks must be so severe that only active played omega account PVP fleets have a chance to act.
---
The first one talks about how adding an ISK cost to *building* capitals is ineffective.
---
The second one talks about how adding an ISK cost to *owning* capitals is effective.
---
One of these things is not like the other.
---
Out of genuine curiosity, how would your proposed solution look in practice?
---
Gal meta is hecates with dual sensor boosters and ecm scripts. Cal meta is jackdaws as they have mental range anyway. 
---
It is a fairly easy swap, but hopefully Cal/Gal mil can work something out. Though they lack the unity they use to have.
---
Holy paragraph breaks Batman.
---
You say that as if mutual masturbation d be a bad thing...?
---
Are they shouting?
---
Are they just really bad at conveying emphasis in the writing?
---
Do they think these words are acronyms?
---
We may never know.
---
Eve, where EVERYONE tells you how to play the game for them.
---
Can bring my Drake? 
---
No! Its a fucking armour fleet!
---
&gt; EVE is not a RW job 
---
Excuse me!?! :D
---
It is as it will lead o the same thing - ability to deploy capitals on grid.              
---
If capital is expensive to build - you pay for owning it once  but more.      
---
If capital is expensive to maintain - you pay less for owning it but in long term you pay much more by having it.          
---
Small groups will not be having capitals as they are expensive to maintain and are used rarely ... but at the same time people in small groups will not invest in them as they are not used often.
---
Even hauling can make for great eve experience posts, remember Jared Dale?
---
So how many focus groups have you run, blowhard? The CSM isn't a meeting where equals are discussing future plans. It's a focus group, where users are being told what a future product is and what they think of it.
---
The CSM isn't there to make decisions. We have no power to make decisions. We're there, basically, to point out flaws in what CCP show us, and that we've seen elsewhere.
---
&gt;But muh serious spaceship business!
---
Well, in FW they're rather clearly harming the FW people. If mission runners farm LP in missions and run the LP-to-isk ratio into the ground, that means those doing FW can't sustain themselves using the LP they get from their FW activities (since they obviously have ships blow up on the regular).
---
yOuR mEeTiNgS aRe NoT oPtImIseD cCp!!111
---
your posting is clearly not optimised, retard
---
That is even worst for small group as people will need to pay more in long run to own one without ability to use it.          
---
Sorry but if you are in a blob and you throw capital fleets around replacing them will be more costly in what i am proposing.          
---
If you are small group that slowly build your capital fleet and use it on rare occasion - then my idea is still better as people will invest in capitals as even if they are laying on station you don't pay for maintaining them.
---
Was it Matterall? I heard he knows The Mittani.

re: critique of your critique
---
your communication style on this board is shit. 
---
it reeks of wannabe. 
---
if you know how to talk to people (the thing that you pretend is your job) then you wouldn't post this.
---
So just do them in the pub to start with and you'll get more time in the pub AND more real meeting time.
---
Win win.
---
You presume that CSM is actually there to help decide direction and offer a feedback system to garner player opinion, I could play the commercial card and say, you are a typical software guy and you are looking at the process rather than the controlling stakeholders desired outcome. It's not really about consultative progress on a dictating a road-map , it's about showing player consultation for existing strategy. 
---
Theoretically good ideas should come from CSM, but the AP's to take these further happen behind the scenes, away from CSM scrutiny. Really CSM is more akin to "client focus groups" than anything else..
---
CSM is the equivalent of that 90's management style where every department elected a "non exec" representative and sent them to a monthly meeting. Occasionally a great idea would emerge, but it would only move forwards if it aligned with existing strategy. Most of the time it session would devolve into someone bitching that the on site canteen ran out of bacon sandwiches too early on fridays, while Glenn from finance tried for the umpteenth time this year to change the stationary requisition procedure.
---
Good post. It's a shame so many retards here are pounding on you for whatever reason.
---
Or link to ADMs. But yea, there is a middle ground here CCP can consider rather than going for the extremes.
---
What content? FW Mission Bots?
---
&gt;big blocks win as they have bigger subcap numbers
---
You can fight subcaps outnumbered and win. You can't do that against supers.
---
Its always been know that the AT was run on devs own time and they were not paid for it
---
https://i.imgur.com/qqmacUJ.jpg
---
You need to understand that the rules aren't arbitrary, they're decided after some (autistically deep Goon) analysis of what's needed to stay ahead of the meta.
---
Also I'm not sure what you mean about "harsh capital ratting rules".  Fireside last weekend Mittani said that you should consider carriers to be like battleships now, i.e. disposable assets.  That doesn't sound particularly harsh to me.
---
Rorqs, Supers and Titans are a different matter of course.  The goal here is to be reasonably competent in order to discourage the enemy.  Personally I have a no-feeding policy (which I waive when I go on a Havish Montak fleet).  
---
Feeding makes the enemy happy.  Don't do it.  Goons have provided the tools for you not to do it, including fits, an umbrella and infrastructure.  There's a lot of work involved in maintaining that which, no doubt, you are not involved in.
---
I'd be interested to know how many paps you have too.
---

So refund some skill points.

&amp;#x200B;
---
Anyone at this point who thinks that the game should stay as it is because they trained into something isn't someone we want in EVE anyway. I'll happily trade the 10k current bitter vets for 75k interested and engaged players.
---
Or peeps just get off their asses and use their assets.
---
The reason shit is cheap is because there is a bigger supply then demand so just make shit die more that the demand goes up again and suddenly you find much healthier markets.
---
This is capitalism 101 demand and supply.
---
That's something I have been thinking about for a couple weeks now. Items getting damaged slowly over time would be an option, this means you would have to disable the free instant repair of Upwell structures though and maybe tie it to a service that needs to be fueled seperatedly.
---
The biggest issue is how to prevent people from gaming the system (like keeping their capitals in repackaged state or in contracts until you need them).
---
That is the REAL bot problem in EVE that doesn't even violate EULA (why ffs??)
---
I've always found the anal degree to which a lot of large alliances create and enforce their rules to be pretty petty. Yeah, some structure and order is necessary but at some point it crosses the line from sensible restriction to a power trip for basement dwellers and it all goes downhill from there.
---
How about false information tactic?!
---
stuff the log with fake logs, append a hash to each log which only the devs can sort out to mark fake and real log entries
---
bot's don't know fake and real unless they break the hash salt and will panic (heck .. gms could probably trigger false logs from server side to check for a real bot easier that way)
---
this way you would still provide basic functionality of the log file itself and confuse bots using the log only
---
The increased demand for minerals will also spike the sub-cap prices. I am not ok with this.
---
Second galaxy on android is basically eve on mobile.

---
No, those two are not the same thing.
---
One sets in place a restriction before the capital is built. The other, after it. One hinders or prevents small entities from creating capitals in the first place while the other associates a trade-off between expanding the capital fleet and improving corp or alliance structure resources.
---
Years ago before I upgraded to omega everyone(in the online com) was telling me how exciting this game was. Now I'm waiting, sometimes days for pings for fleets to happen but nothing happens and if it does nothing goes down, I travel 10-20 jumps to come home with zero km's.

No, the corporate coaches in question failed to grasp the actual issue at play and were instead more focused on ingraining their program ideologies.
---
Since then we've swapped to a system where by proposing consultants visit for a day or two and provide a written assessment as part of their pitch based on their interactions with the teams, to see if they actually managed to get to the bottom of the manager's psyches.
---
I'm not saying all of the problems are nonsense (I still use elements of GTD and Agile for my own personal time management, and Wunderlist is probably the biggest takeaway I had from all of that), but I am saying that, from my experience, 9 times out of 10 the coaches were full of shit, flinging as much of that shit at you in a vain hope that some of it would stick and justify their meal ticket.

That is mostly about how high you set the maintenance cost, but capitals are expensive enough both in materials and skill time (if you don't want to use injectors), that you should be able to afford the maintenance cost as a capital owner.
---
If you are in a blob and throw capitals around, in a lot of cases you do it in an environment were your losses are not really affecting you, if you have any at all (for example in your umbrella region). With a maintenance cost, using these ships still costs you.
---
If you are a small group, your capital fleet will consist of a few core capitals maintained by the more wealthy players or corps and capitals that you build for a deployment and that you actually want to use and lose at some point, to avoid paying maintenance for them forever.
---
Hmmm but the ones causing the serenity problem on TQ aren't Chinese I think

Fair enough, but the toggle would be in the same place as the current joining mechanic.

Add at the bottom of your pi spreadsheet to login alpha and sort skill queue. That way when you get you get the itch again you'll have better skills and only be doing it after you finish your to do list ]; )

You may want more than 1 alpha fw though, 1 PvP and 1 focused on Logi skill set. From my experience Logi is much more fun and always welcome.
---
It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

Shield Curse, be invisible to d scan. Kill anything that has active tank, Kill anything that needs cap to shoot. Exterminate small frigate roams solo.
---
Anything you can't kill you mwd away from as you are fast as f'. Anything that is faster than you then neut their tackle off and warp.
---
Try avoid buffer tank missile and artilery ships. So drake nvy issue ect &amp; Macharials are a bit of an issue unless super actively tankez.
---
Laugth as noobs try to fire kinetic and explosive at your ammar ship, you got 90% resist tank.
---
Buffer battleships are now an issue due to damage control neding no cap. Avoid buffer tank
---
You are aware that the majority of Capitals are actually for combat and just dont get used right?

Won't CCP be able to check against the server logs? The client doesn't have to know if it's a false or a true entry.
---
Then again, i know next to nothing of coding and it probably is eadier said then done (on a big scale).
---
Alliances would be a thing either if it had in-game support for it or not. It's just a bunch of people agreeing to cooperate. Really no way to avoid it, especially in a sandbox.

If you're referring to botting problems, it didn't start with the Chinese and may or may not be exacerbated by them but I can't say for sure until there are solid stats. For the RMT problem, it certainly didn't start with the Chinese either, although it seems some of them are heavily invested in it. Although tbf I don't think the RMT problem is in any way worsened by the Chinese, I just think that Chinese RMTers have more cash, not necessarily there being a significant number of them. If you have solid evidence to proof how prevalent Chinese RMTers are, please prove me wrong. (ex the RR purchase, if it really was RMT, would be an outlier, not a representation of the population)
---
As for the blue donut problem - the biggest offenders in TQ would be Legacy and the Imperium, both of which actually have mostly US leadership. So that would be an EVE mechanics problem.
---
Lots of people still don't know this, but the biggest reasons Serenity collapsed was: uncontrolled botting (serious oversight of the Chinese company in charge), RMT (because of uncontrolled botting and hyperinflation, there was no real way to get to the top unless you yourself bought isk or botted in any reasonable timeframe. Also serious oversight by the Chinese company), and literally the whole galaxy under the PIBC banner. 
---
From my experience on Serenity and from Chinese people who used to play on it, the average number of players a day barely pushed a thousand if it wasn't in the hundreds. That's how bad it was. \~So, I'm not saying the Chinese are not at fault for the state of TQ right now, I'm simply disagreeing with people that say Serenity will happen to TQ just because of the Chinese. Not only is TQ much more heavily policed with a serious CCP conviction to fight against RMT and bots, but there is simply not as much a need for RMT, with items beings hundreds or thousands of times cheaper than the ones on Serenity. As for the big blue beautiful donut, the biggest offender would probably be Legacy.

perhaps they are trying to do some sort of economic damage to you guys? being a dick at the top makes people want to hit back, and given that one of your main strengths is your economic backbone, it makes sense to try and target it.
---
Well most of the highsec missions dont really generate that much isk to economy (LP stores). Ones that generate quite a bit like old incursions are hard capped to certain amount of characters. If you want to fix mining value, i think the 1st place that is going to need a good whack is null mining.
---
That's what he said in his post. There is no focus and if so, then what you describe would be option a).
---
Fights at this scale in k-space end up being like an asymmetrical heavy armor brawl.

One side is very tanky but lacks DPS, The other side has lots of logi and a sizeable numbers advantage, but not enough to ignore the first side's tank.

You can change the words of any sentence to change the meaning or truth of it. If you changed it to your example people considering it racist would be irrelevant if it was fact. That is the problem these days, people don't care about what is true just if it hurts their feelings.
---
I live in jspace *because* there is no local. If you’re implying I live there to make isk, you’re mistaken; null ratting and mining makes way more isk than wormhole life ever could. I live in jspace because it’s more exciting- more exciting to pve and pvp. There should always be risk, and currently the rest of eve has absolutely zero. My personal opinion is that all of eve should have no local. D scan exists for a reason.

Get rid of Keepstars in highsec. Titans and supers shouldn't cost this little. It's fucking stupid. Titans used to mean something now we just throw them around like nothing. Make faction Titans actually something to use. Not just a status symbol same goes with all the other faction caps. Asset safety is dumb. Don't do waves of bans. Fucking do it asap. Listen to FW guys hit just us in nullsec.

More importantly, that sotiyo had indy jobs that had been running in there that fellow imperium members were running, the loot belonged to those people and it was organised that only certain people were supposed to loot it, random greedy rorqual trying to profit off his own groups misfortune deserves the commissar.
---
Csm execution is a joke and we all know it.
---
Ah, that explains it, moons ain’t gonna mine themselves ;)
---
Holy koolaif
---
It was mostly the other side of the fence crying for drastic local changes.       
---
And i think it would have been better received if it was better though out and implemented.
---
(there were plenty suggestions to get inspiration from, yet ccp went with the "remove local" meme.)

---
I don't think he agreed with you...
---
Oh damn? Really? I was afk for the past week, but if that’s the the fucker deserves a blacklist for goonfucking.
---
That’s just fucking over your coalition. I’m happy he got commissar’d for that.
---
Here is my AAR:
---
Yesterday I came home from work and logged in my Main in his bold Ratting-Hel as well as my 11 mining alts. Found me a nice system with a Colossal and 2 R64 Moons nicely upgraded to sport 5 Rock Havens too. After properly setting up NEAR2 and TACO I warped my Rorqual and 10 Hulks to the 1st moon and docked my Cyno-Toon in his Falcon on the Athanor. Checked jumprange to secure I am under the umbrella. After fully setting up on the moon with my Wetu I do 2-3 Havens until "insert random series" starts on Netflix. I turn up the warning sound volume for NEAR2 and tab out. Grabbing Popcorn ... 10 mins later ALARM goes off, I tab in and see that some retarded and autistic wormholers have rolled into my neighbouring system ... Sabre on dscan. I pull my excavators ... palms sweaty. Bubble goes up. Tab in Falcon Alt and join standing fleet &amp; comms. Scream for help "Chelp Gais, im tacklid, chelp pliis!!". Ping goes off and a lot of bored Nerds join the fleet with their Supers. 
---
I get yelled at to both not miss the moment to light the cyno because of Inhibs but not to early to not get volleyed off by these cowardly kiting Lokis. FC tells me I can light, 4 times the number of attackers pours in in Titans/Supers/FAXes, one guy confidentally bosoning my cyno ... cowardly retards retreat to Wormhole, we bubble it and camp it with 40 Ratting Supers. It was a good day ... docking Rorqu and Hulks, made at least some peanuts (just some Billions) during Netflix.
---
I agree with you. Last week the typhoon fleet issue was more expensive than a Machariel and close to the Phantasm. A quick look to zkill shows which one people prefer. So there is a limit to how much isk/lp ratio can go up. Otherwise we fall into a skimming pricing.
---
And while being so expensive, the Phoon Issue only manage a 1300isk/lp ratio. So less than datacores and less than drones or ammos.
---
My 0,002 iskies is : people will earn less LP but will sell it a stable rate in a longer period for products worth the competition ( ammos, drones, republic shield extenders, datacores). The extra LP no able to be absorbed by the market will be dumped into upgrading our ships or at worse rate in items whose market has less competition.
---
Which is already the case : one of U'K doctrine is the Phoon fleet issue just because beyond the RP, it's a bloody efficient way to dump your extra LP. Dock with ship, upgrade ship, undock. People presently selling Fleet Typhoons probably do it because they wish to cash out faster than in more lucrative but more competitive markets.
---
So removing missions won't make the isk/lp skyrocket because otherwise as in any supply and demand economy, buyers switch to the next product ( from Republic fleet or Caldary navy shield to the thukker one for instance). What removing missions will do is remove the inflation bubbles/crashes linked with tier 5 and intensive farming.
---
So no magical cash out with 6K isk/lp but a more stable market with a yearly average indeed closer to the max value an item can have without pushing customers to look for a replacement.
---
What do you think ? Looks like you thought this over and probably longer than me
---
Oh look its an uncreative copy paste response.
---
Man you sure do got "it".
---
Simple. Rules are rules, break them and you get punished. It like warping to a bridge black ops de cloaked, When told not to.
---
In this case these cases they normally have a salvage guy on stand by they can trust to not just fuck off with the loot, he clearly wasn't the guy.
---
sheesh, who pissed in this guy's cheerios
---
drugs and no life is bad ....
---
I know you’re a brainlet but did you even watch the video
---
No. Let's say for example you only look at the plex price. It's mostly defined by CCP's offers and so on. It's also strongly coupled to skill extractors, multiple training licences, and skill injectors. This means that offers for them also affect the plex price. You can see how it react in the short time but also long time prices are affected. As an example, the very high plex prices at the beginning of the year were mostly caused by the booster which made you inject SP without the drawback. This caused a big demand increase in injectors which meant a big demand increase in SP on skillfarms which meant people bought more plex and MTLs. But at the same time CCP did no offers at all for those. For reddit it was of course all bots and so on. But it's very difficult to differentiate how much of the effect is caused by what.
---
he actually clicked twice .... but anyway, yeah
---
You're absolutely right. Famous players should stop playing once they're too famous. Can't have them enjoying the game they're famous for...
---
We're not as big as Goons and we don't exactly lack a handful of rules, but MCAV seems to have no issues with just not being massively anal about literally everything.
---
Except sex. We're very anal about sex.
---
so bots exists because of logs.... ok, good thinking
---
imagine having to pay someone to be a member of your corp
---
Oh hey, toad is on there. He just pops up everywhere.
---
Noone ever claimed that man, not sure what made you think that.
---
Lol this is so true. "Here is a template on how to speak your mind and get better feedback in a meeting." How about I just state my point in one sentence instead of following a 5 page checklist? Maybe that way we can actually get some work done this year.
---
Oh, you are talking about a sprint.
---
Scrum is the name of the framework.
---
QA is part of the story. That's why you use cross functional teams. The plus makes no sense there.
---
Deployment can happen whenever and in the best case automated and quickly (CI/CD).
---
The length of the story depends on how you, the team, and the PO cut them. If they are too big, try splitting them in smaller ones.
---
Implying awoxing people is “fun”
---
So you... pop a DD, giving the rag a cooldown?
---
Ok
---
Let me know too. I’ll even go 1v1 with you.
---
IME that seems to be a problem largely restricted to corps that recruit anyone with a pulse, and who give consideration to those without one.
---
Fleet PvE with mission style payouts has a long history of being run by either bling T3s or capitals.
---
of course authorized blueshoots are fun, cripes
---
Thats democracy for you.
---
Dude, awoxing is great fun. What are you talking about?
---
this wasn't an awox, but awoxing is hells of fun
---
Not more then the people abiding by it, they aren't banning FW missions they are making it nearly impossible to blitz them by making it so you can't dock to get missions.
---
I havent read a legit /u/Lords_Servant post about recent developments. I wonder why.
---
All focus groups ever feel this way. If you dont have power then its not a negotiation, its just "we listen and if you say something we like we will use that to support our own point, but the rest, go fk yourself".
---
Nice initiative. Hope you prevail.
---
For a long time now, EVE has survived in spite of its developers, not because of them.
---
Nope, i blocked youtube on this network :D
---
Yep. The latest csm minutes prove they have zero interest in solving the botting problem with real solutions or complex ones. They haven't even put basic work into it.
---
Option 3 :             
---
- CCP will not invest Dev time as EVE is in maintenance mode.
---
Guy was being a tool when a director saw his fit was shit and told him to fix it.
---
Brent is correct. Rabbert is full of it.
---
OR... try fitting your ship right?
---
Hei there,
---
I messed up my reps with every faction so I never really tried faction PVP ; is there a way for me to come get some fight without taking care of the ISKs or the payout? I can already take care of my self,
---
Cheers !
---
Do it the Persian way. Discuss an idea on both sober and drunk states. If it passes, implement it.
---
I was just making sure if I missed suitonia signing up with CCP or something. 
---
It may seem a bit pedantic, but it's not a devblog if he's no dev.
---
Lol you greatly underestimate the idk/h these fw things bring in with so little effort. With the impetus drugs I was doing 800k LP/h in calgal jackdaw with no alt assistance, so a bunch of rorqs for one insta warp jackdaw. Far from cute cause one of these alts is worth many null farmers in terms of money making power.
---
You are an idiot.
---
The little Sotiyo that could. 
---
F
---
Please keep this attitude. Isk is isk and i will gladly take care of those 25+m isk data sites she you. Def not worth running.
---
It really beggars belief that people cannot understand that. Follow the rules == you are fine. Break the rules == commissar. 
---
It really is not hard to follow rules.
---
Oh my bad, you are right, didn't even realized I typed that.
---
in other news, water still wet
---
That is fucking absurd....
---
I read "idiots" as "pilots" the first couple of times. Not that there is a lot of difference.
---
Actually the CSM is a bad mock of players.  
---
"CSM" is the abbreviation for "Customer Service Manager" also known as "ticket-whores"  
---
 or "that sorry bastards that have to keep customers calm and happy who before got enraged by bad decissions from higher up".  
---
And thats what the CSM is, a cheap customer-service-alternative that doesnt even cost the company health-insurances or shit. Opiates for the players so they feel like they would have a saying about anything CCPs game-design- or DEV-department shits out.
---
Would you say PL fell into that category a few years back?
---
Yet there weren't many nullsec entities with stricter rules in some regards. Self sustainability and for instance. Or their approach at elitism.
---
I also don't see the problem with following a few simple rules to keep everyone happy. It's not like they require you to hand over your first born.
---
^
---
I'm not disputing the content of your comments! Just trying to avoid confusions.
---
CCP can't handle the balance of the existing ships and mods, and you're asking to add new ones.
---
best titan pilot in the game :eggplant:
---
I don't say you are wrong, the problems i see :             
---
* dev time ^(aka this will not happen then)       
---
* increased complexity of the game ^(aka something what CCP want to remove due to NPE)         
---
But i like  your basic idea.        
---
Could argue how you obtain some stuff but i don't see CCP interested in it as it complicates module tiercide that is already overdue for years now.
---
Make it X to kill someone. Make it 1/2X to get killed. At least a lot of ships would get destroyed.
---
Actually, I don't think they need to tweak mods at all: keep their parameters the same, just slap a "light" or "medium" tag on them.
---
But I thought the logs dont show anything
---
yea it's modeled after reality - when shit gets tough in my country i can just roll an alt to earn my money in the largest, safest blob and then go back and be a rebel in my own space.
---
&gt;If a carrier pilot is buying gyrostabilizers or heat sinks that I might want for my assault frigates, what is he doing with them? Fitting them to his own assault frigates?
---
I don't seem to understand, can you elaborate a bit more?
---
Also, I underlined those concepts to explain along the post how the new changes would affect them
---
I just underlined them to explain how the changes would affect both those aspects
---
Definitely a 2nd semester MBA student with this shit attitude and superficial grasp of these concepts. lol
---
Easy ! Best time of my EVE life was the 30v1 when I gated my Naglfar within Syndicate. They were 30 cruisers to frigates vs my capital. It was fun as fuck and both sides ended up havng a good time (one guy even sent me 3 bill to come back)
---
False equivalency, but thanks for bringing up multiboxing. I also believe that multi boxers should be banned as they ruin the game
---
From what ive heard of it tho, its a straight up "pay or dont progress" game.
---
So which rorqual was you?
---
What are YOU insinuating?
---
No, he is goon minion #25384, who didn't get a new killmark on his titan
---
So why not drop more caps and have even more fun!
---
Keep an eye in the listed systems.blap anyone trying to flip the plexs (except defensive plexing).
---
God fucking dammit...  
---
  
---
OP is pathetic....
---
Where to start, where to start.  
---
Title had nothing to do with the post. Bad OP!  
---
Complaining about your own post content. Bad OP!  
---
Massive gap in the post that looks like there should be an image there which I waited for longer than I want to admit to appear. Bad me (and bad OP)!
---
Also, I have no brave battles, just sweat covered panicked battles. Do they count?
---
When CCP divided the rigs into the different sizes, all rigs became large rigs, even if fit to a ship.
---
Stat bonus applied normally. If you had a hanger of 500 rigs, they became large rigs.
---
They're worth it when you're going to be shooting 1 target for a long time. For example, whaling, structure bashing, etc. Not farming conduits
---
You are missing some points here.          
---
* Turning all faction/ded/officer mods to S version will be unfair for many people.        
---
Many people don't like small ships.           
---
* Some people did grind for the better mods and will now need to do it again. Questionable "pleasure"            
---
* Giving upgrade to the currently fitted module can be easily abused, like T2 invul for frigate will use less materials than one for battleship or capital. So if i refit my ships to get the most expensive mods in the biggest size ... i can generate insane amounts of free materials.          
---
Like current T2 module cost 1mil ... but if it gets upgraded to capital version the materials in it will raise to like 300mil +
---
They could either make them all directly comparable, or this could allow easier balancing, as they could adjust the tiers to make them all competitive on each ship type.
---
But making them comparable at least makes it the same as now, expect with a better economy around the whole thing.
---
Run a couple of decayed mutaplasmids until you get a good roll, and voila, low-priced, slight upgrades.
---
Obviously fake news. Everyone KNOWS Mittani never logs in 😂
---
&gt; creatively work on ability to acquire all sizes
---
We need more loot in data sites, right?
---
Otherwise do it the same exact way we already do different size things, like guns, active tank mods, and neuts.
---
This would probably be the best way to do it.
---
Or have it be everything unequipped is large, everything equipped is that ship's size.
---
Provided that large mods would be the hardest to get, this avoids any risk of the market being way too massively fucked up while the stuff gets found.
---
The rorq has come to steal the loot that was drop by the structure.
---
For what it's worth, there are at least 2-3 people on almost every CSM that don't do anything but market and industry.
---
&gt; If a carrier pilot is buying gyrostabilizers or heat sinks that I might want for my assault frigates, what is he doing with them? Fitting them to his own assault frigates?
---
He might be butting them on his nag instead of on a frigate.
---
So his nag can justify a high price, but your assault frigate can't.
---
So this change would make frigates more economical. So that the cost of the increase in power would be similar for all size ships to get that extra gain (in regards to total fit cost).
---
You specified carriers as an example, but which percentage mods are shared by carriers and basically anything else? I can only think of drone, resist, and maneuverability stuff. Of those, resist is the most important.
---
My point is that applying this across the board to all modules is a mistake.
---
Besides, frigate pilots will still be competing with the Abyssal runners and their massive amounts of ISK.
---
No there arnt.
---
Thats ccps issue but as proven doing smth against ratting and mining will just kill the game quicker so make war not Blackout
---
This is actually a smart change. I was thinking about this recently too.
---
But it may be too much, and can increase confusion.
---
Maybe leave all t2 and normal meta the same, but have the DED, faction, and officer split up.
---
To bad this isnt a government, its supposed to be a group of people in the game that represents the players and the different aspects of eve to ccp.
---
Who cares if the FW LP market is cyclical?..Hell I KNOW it is because I used to PLAY the FW LP market. If it's low HOLD and wait. When it's high SELL SELL SELL! It's just like the real world!
---
At least this plan shows some understanding of real economics though. Most player REEEEEE! Save us CCP! plans most surely don't.
---
HiSec is (probably) (mostly) fine at the moment.
---
There was some concern about allowing ABCs to be mined in 0.5 systems, but the MER has removed this as a real concern. Probably activities that add *material* to the game are much healthier than activities that add money to the game. There's not a lot of money being added to the system from HiSec, nor is there a lot of material.
---
Yeah I can only imagine the eye rolling that went on when an ideas guy threw "encrypted memory" on the table for a project like EVE.
---
Yeah, that seems like a system that would be impossible to abuse!
---
I'm sorry if that answer was not exhaustive, but I never was for the Upgrade with the hull on patch day: even those mods get downgraded, like the rest. 
---
As for the fairness of it, this subreddit is obsessed with reducing the gap between new and existing players, yet no one is willing to make a sacrifice...we are gonna end with an old guard with titans and no one to shoot, like it's happening right now...And I don't understand the "pleasure" aspect of it, pretend you ship got blasted to pieces and you need to fit a new one, or keep mining, and it will be on the market sooner or later. TII will still be affordable, it's the bling you will need to wait for...
---
It wasn't a jump freighter. It was an empty Charon who was given 5+ minutes to get off of grid and was still sitting there when triage ended for the FAXes that warped to save him. Freighter pilots that can't watch for bubbles in 1dq1 are lucky enough that some people will try to save them, don't put those FAX pilots at greater risk by being a potato and not getting safe asap.
---
Wrong
---
He tried to use his little bit of space power to tell a director to fuck off and some other dumb shit. All he had to do was fix his fit and not be a dick about it.
---
amen! 
---
I mean not outright banned but not allowed, like with the alpha/omega limitation.
---
CSM isn't a workshop or isn't a business meeting where decisions are being made together. If you ask me, it's not exactly a focus group either as a focus group implies random sampling of people. 
---
CSM is a group into which people hopefully choose expert representatives reflecting their Eve balance views and interests. In turn, here is a few things CSM does.
---
1) Steer CCP from bad ideas. This gets overstressed a lot and while I think it's important, I don't think it's the only job of CSM. And I think most of these ideas are so obviously bad that no matter who gets elected among the top 25 candidates, this task will be done. So this isn't something for particular CSMs to take credit for.
---
2) Be a slight influence on what Eve problems CCP is prioritizing the very precious devtime.
---
3) Provide a marketplace of ideas for solutions to Eve's problems, which may or may not be used at some point in the future.
---
4) Represent the interests of Eve population in matters of community consensus. Represent the interests of people who voted them in, in matters of a clash of interest between playstyles.
---
None of these tasks are in such a nature to yield a "things to do" or "decisions made" list at the end of the week. CCP absorbs what they do from the meetings, and moves forward. It initially might look like they don't care at all about the meetings, but only in a year or two you realize how much influence the CSMs of the past years had in hindsight. And that explains why CCP keeps paying tens of thousands of dollars each year to bring people in Iceland.
---
Ah, just noticed its not an active fit. 
---
Fair enough then.
---
also I don't think it's a fallacy - just a point you're not considering here - which is the absence of singular identity (subsequently accountability) as well as the lack for basic needs and immortality. Rest of it is modeled after reality :))
---
Imagine having to do that in 2019
---
Yeah, because battleships need to be more expensive for their relative power.
---
Looking on this in a bit different way. 
---
Why do you want to put officer mods on the frigate?        
---
Why faction mods should be cheaper for frigates while offering the same ?             
---
Simplified example.           
---
T2 mod have 20km range.             
---
Why the same range should be for the S module and for the XL module?
---
Wtb more content astras
---
Don't forget that it was specifically pinged that loot and salvage were nationalized.
---
They could make them available on one of the test servers and go from there, tq isk from teams go into a prize pot and relaxed rules re: implants?
---
Ive never done it myself, but in principle you want inertial stabs/low friction nozzle joints to get you under 2s align time in propulsion mode, a small amount of shield buffer, a mwd/ab just in case, and missile guidance comps with range scripts. Maybe a sebo? Depends on your max missile range. If you fit inertial stabs instead of nozzles, use hyperspatial rigs for faster travel. Im not 100% sure on dps needed so you might have to have some ballistic controls and find the balance of dps and align time needed.  Get as far away from the target as possible, spam dscan, shoot with your insane range, gtfo. Repeat over and over until you have made enough LP to damn near ruin the market.
---
in fairness, that's probably about the only really noteworthy thing going on in eve right now. also, from what i've heard it's also completely cancerous given the cyno changes, structure timer mechanics, and such.
---
Time for a coup.
---
To start from the bottom, I was careful not to include tackle mods in the proposal, as that would considerably influence the engagement profiles, and create imbalance.
---
In terms of range, you would share it will smaller ships, but your DPS would be quite higher, as it's already based on bigger drones and guns.
---
The faction mods for frigates **will be offering the same only against other frigates,** as their DPS and tank is lower than a bigger ship. An officer fitted frigate still won't be able to solo a cruiser most of the cases, but will drop juicer loot...that you can only use for frigates. It's like giving shinier wooden swords to kids: they won't impact an adult, but it's nice eye-candy for their games :) 
---
Also, as I said in the article, officer mods will still be more expensive, but they can be gained and lost just by offering frigate content. I really like frigates and the impact they have on new players
---
"Content" would be a fight or ship to kill. If they can't kill you because you warped away, you denied them "content".
---
Actually this wont happen on Tranq. Even if all Chinese group together they will eventually have to fight Imperium
---
&gt;Have existing highsec sources trend towards light, lowsec towards medium, and nullsec towards the heavy.
---
This is the aim of the new distribution, yes. If all you do is rat in hisec, the best you get are TII mods for your battleship. If you go low or null, it gets more rewarding.
---
Shit, I don't have time for Eve these days, but maybe I should make timr now and resub. Am-mil was always home for me.
---
skilling spree shouldn't exist, that's the short and long of it. They tried it a couple of years ago and saw some more people log in but ultimately didn't help the game in any tangible way.
---
Yeah i totally agree. The good health of eve starts with an active highsec population.
---
the cult classic of getting smashed with the devs afterwards is a tried old technique that never gets old!
---
I really don't like the Rng element the mutaplasmids include, and still people are competing for the same mod, even if they intend to use them differently. I really would like to have "weight" categories: pig PvE rats can have their share of the market, small PvP frigates can have another
---
I still have an Iteron V with large rigs fit from before the change. It’s stats are proper for that rig type, just the size is wrong
---
Alright let's do some double checking here. Unlike you, who works for some spitfuck IT consulting smallshop who seems to get off on hating your clients instead of providing value and making money, I happen work for a Big 4 Professional Consulting Service and my clients are government agencies such as DoD component agency Directors. 
---
All of your criticisms about the room and structure are a complete joke and entirely illegitimate. Cry more about the tables and chairs why don't you? Snacks and coffee are perfectly appropriate for an all day seminar. No Technology? No wonder your clients take years to come around because you haven't shown them a single work product or deliverable on a computer screen? What a joke.
---
Why are you surprised that they come with an agenda? The CSM is basically a community elected consulting group. CCP still drives the bus, but they provide advice and guidance. You misunderstand the roles and relationships. Would you get upset if your client showed up to a meeting with an agenda for what HE wants to discuss and is paying YOU to discuss with him?
---
This pot is trash 0/10
---
PBUH
---
It's possible to lose your hawk in T4/T5 abyssal, but it's so cheap and such a trivial part of the isk/hour that it's basically like losing fighters with super ratting. If a dread spawns and aggros a fighter wing instead of you, you can lose 2-3 fighters and that's basically the same price as an abyssal hawk.
---
As we already have a lot of guns for all sizes of ships, having the mods tied to ships is really that confusing? Also the TII variants are the easiest to balance, as you can make blueprints available before the actual patch. I would love new content centered around frigates, but even a reskin of the existing ones would be a huge step forward in terms of facilitating small ship gameplay
---
Making stuff cheaper is not the answer. Its actually pretty nice atm - want more dps, tank, utility than others - you spend a lot more isk. More risk, more excitement.  Blue stuff should be rare in pvp, dont make everything blue in the fitting window for everybody and thus also boring. Leave some excitement, rage, risk and joy (for the killers and looters).
---
&gt;So this change would make frigates more economical. So that the cost of the increase in power would be similar for all size ships to get that extra gain (in regards to total fit cost).
---
That's a very clear way to put it, thanks!
---
Many would puss outta nullsec if not for asset safety
---
Maybe down lowsec stain guy will get his gate
---
You are forgiven, this time :)
---
I'd recommend, fix your security status a bit and then don't take the first best wh entrance near jita. Alot beginners do that, and they are fished by hunters there. Take a quiet system maybe something like 10+ out of jita ... way higher chance to have nobody there. :)
---
Well, not quite.
---
Right now highsec drops plenty of ded and faction stuff.
---
t2 doesn't drop at all.
---
&gt; Also the TII variants are the easiest to balance, as you can make blueprints available before the actual patch.
---
What?
---
No u
---
We all agree to stick on alphas in noobships or T1 cruisers in Yulai and then just let mains kill them.
---
Or have one citadel that has select red alts on the ACL only and no market besides the specific hauler that brings in ships to kills.
---
" The majority of Amarr and Minmatar Faction Warfare players agreed through their corps and alliances... "
---
Liar.
---
Tell that to people soloing Minor conduits in Rattles...not all battleships are created equal. 
---
In my idea, if you want expensive battleship mods, you fit a T1 BS, take it to low, run some sites and come back. If you die, content and fun were had, if you live you can bling your lvl4 rattle and make more money.
---
Can I place a gas into rorqual's ore hold?
---
Going to make Amarr/Minmatar FW alts just to piss you off now. thanks for giving Eve purpose for me again. o/
---
just as bad as streamers using their cult of personality to do his bidding. i dont blame the streamer/popular guy - it's the idiots who follow him.
---
Lets just delete r/eve
---
Not the worst idea given Reddits new "bullying" policy.
---
so when we had poses there was nobody in null sec?
---
This is not new information.
---
I don't really see the point. In most cases they will be dead before they can ramp up.
---
And then ramp up over 30mins to 100kdps
---
We've also switched all development to the ZX Spectrum.
---
So basically you're Bob from office space, good to admit early in the post so we don't waste too much time reading.
---
Yeah but unless we go through the trouble of kicking them out it's fighting the same people every other week.
---
And remove null too! No super and titan proliferation anymore!
---
Well if you are trying to do it in space with real pvp pilots you need to be more prepared
---
WH space is, in my opinion, such an experience in eve, that if it was it's own game, there would be a steady following of players that love the shit out of it.
---
If you ever want to dip more into WH space, and get that kind of excitement more often, hit me up.
---
There are plenty of old players in highsec. Like you. Problem is you refuse to grow up and end up using the 'noobs' as a shield to protect yourself.
---
It uses missiles. Missiles can be firewalled. If there are a few Levis in a blob of a hundred Titans that doesn't matter much. If you have many of them, people will start to use firewalls though.
---
Additionally most groups are armor heavy in their Titans. People give different reasons for that. Although the trend goes to mixed groups of Titans (and supers).
---
But with a Guardian-Vexor you get 5 more drones....
---
Full ramp up is like the deathstar, and boom it's gone. Structure killer. One can imagine right.
---
\&gt;  There are plenty of old players in highsec. Like you.    
---
And the criticism was on their attacks on new players. 
---
\&gt;  Problem is you refuse to grow up    
---
The problem is that they attack new players.  
---
The problem, apparently, is your reading and comprehension.
---
Did you miss word "brawling"?..
---
Get ze luger
---
idk someone said something about a waffle...
---
He is right in some areas though. There is a lot of talk at the CSM meetings, many problems are correctly identified, but then there is no action. Zero. None. Even cheap changes like nerfing an overpowered ship (i.e. Svipul) take SEVERAL YEARS.
---
Would be fun if it had the ramping up mechanic and no upper dps limit
---
Exactly. If the opposing militia owns the system, we can't dock to its npc stations and have access to the mission agents.
---
they canceled blackout
---
they needed to endure, to not give in, to show that they believed in their vision and that they were prepared to die on a hill 
---
but they caved. and now they are lost because they let a select few players dictate to them decisions they are not allowed to make
---
I feel like it wouldn’t be too difficult but the big issue is how does ccp determine which ones are real or not. If you put something like n extra word somewhere it’s not supposed to be then it’ll take a week maybe more for the botters to find it and counter it. They could keep doing that but then it just turns into the Cold War oh back and forth though that might just work as well
---
That jab at Xi though... nice.
---
Even if it could ramp up forever it would still reset when the gun runs out of charges and reloads
---
Full ramp up is like the deathstar, and ~~boom it's gone.~~ boom its reinf for 9 days 21 hours!
---
Life is good again, the sounds are back and close to their original duration.  Thanks all!!!
---
and he liketh the salt.
---
No point In having low either that gets rid of all capital ships and makes battleships relevant again!
---
Just start with C4 space.
---
DELET C4!
---
Even if you say regular missions it will still depend a lot on how you run the missions. I don't have the expertise to give you the rundown on different methods. Following video/podcast might be interesting for you https://youtu.be/ZMWj2boHpR0
---
If we dont have caps we may as well let people spawn ships. Crusers are so freaking cheep that the rest of the game is pointless if they stay "top dog"
---
What? Please seek help.

---
### Technical:
---
* Addressed distance in space rounding error.
---
* Fixed an issue where logs from the client would indicate when a cloaked ship on grid initiates warp.
---
I don't think they're damaging the game, but I do think that the low risk of highsec needs to be low reward as well.
---
u/stainguy can dream
---
The same calculation engine that estimates that the 10k SP I got this morning in skilling spree was going to save me 5d 4h 37m in training time.
---
What is punishment for bluing too many people 101
---
Drifter hole spawn rates should be cut in half for this exact reason lol
---
Sortof.
---
Just did two fast highsec (0.6) sites; a Relic and Data, both "Difficulty: IV" (whatever the fuck that means).
---
Relic had 6 cans; one of which was empty, and the other five had a market value of 237k.  A bit better than I remember.
---
Data had 4 cans; Two had Calm Filaments.  The decryptors and datacore inside, along with the other junk, was 4.5m on market.
---
I don't know, you sure about this?  Next you'll say "Go to nullsec/Wormhole" which I will, but just from this I'm getting 20x more money with a third less work on Data sites.
---
And boom you're hitting the dps cap lol
---
You need a base standing 0 with out bonuses from skills to be Abel to join
---
RIP my Battlecruiser 5 skill 9/11 never4get
---
Level 4 missions will generally give you around 20+ mil ISK in bounties (let's say 20-30 depending on the mission, I assume this is fairly consistent between the factions). If you are running them at "max" speed but not blitzing, so you kill everything, you can do maybe 2 missions per hour (or 3-4 of the shorter ones). 
---
I found clear speed in a T3C is slightly slower than a marauder or pirate BS, but the extra speed CAN make a difference depending on the layout of the missions. 
---
Marauders have the fastest clear speed but you need to practice a bit with the bastion module and MJD'ing in a triangle shape to drop right on top of acceleration gates. Mistiming these two modules will make you waste a lot of time by either being locked in place or dropped somewhere random on the grid, away from your targets and the gate.
---
Salvage increases your payout by I'd say 20 to 40 percent depending on salvage drops, and again assuming you salvage everything, preferably with a noctis alt that just jumps in on a pile of wrecks gathered together by the missioning ship's MTU. Otherwise the extra time spent salvaging might not be worth it.
---
Aryth is pretty much permanent CSM member and he's mostly economy guy, for example. Not sure about innominate, but he is also administrative guy iirc.
---
Single cap booster, inject right before spool.
---
The spool will probably be long.
---
Being a dick is one thing. Awoxing someone because he doesn't follow the fitting rules is another.
---
The players play the game because of the game, not because of the rules. The rules are just tolerated for the sake of staying in the corp/alliance. That's the perspective of a simple member.
---
hur dur derp
---
Yeah but it's one dread instead of 2. Very usefull when short on pilots.
---
When the price normalizes that is.
---
I'm not really sure how I'd feel about a book featuring nerds staying docked then ranting about the game dying on Reddit.
---
So Goons destroyed him. what the actual fuck is that? Stop saving people then, I don't want to be saved, please don't come. It's like you call the police because someone tried to rob your house, and after arresting the rober, they rob you because you we too dumb and left you door open.
---
&gt;pve'ers need to die. in eve, if you dont fight, you die.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;You do realize than PVEers aren't fighters ? Why not asking PVPers to die too ?
---
Yes, pvper die. its kind of a given hence me not pointing out the obvious. no they are not fighters (even if most do pvp and pve not everyone is all or nothing. but pve in eve, is NOT FUCKING World of Warcraft. PVP is everywhere. and the new people joining the game (last 2 years) complaining about the fact they die doing pve in nullsec has ruined the community
---
&gt; You do realize than what you just describe is the supercap umbrella in a nutshell ? And most of the time, fax/carrier/dread are alt accounts. 
---
no, its not. im part of NC. who run a 3 or 4 alliance inside one standing fleet umbrella. i know whats its like. to farm. to defend. to attack. 
---
eve has brought peeople closer....but im talking. no more 2or 3 random guys can go mining. its bigger, and more refined to one system at a time.  thats what i mean by pul people even closer.
---
im sorry local or no local. if me and 6buddies went rorqual mining, its not an issue to have 3 recons on field. 12 rorquals. a scout on each gate, and a gate + 1 from that (choose a system wise) and just have eyes around
---
Goons stopped mining before cyno changes because thierleadership knows theyre line members and pve'er are dumb as fuck, and they wanted to have the changes come in to give them instruction on how to play to be safe.
---
they mostly proberly left because 'its too hard' or 'its not fair'
---
same for all groups of course.
---
 
---
&gt;the fact is.eve has lost its skill requirement. any fucking idiot can jump into a super/titan/rorqual and make isk, fight. win. defend themselves. this needs to go back to these things are kind of skill trapped. idiots with them die off. only brave souls who are'brave/skilled can own these things.  
---
&gt;Fully agree. EVE died the day that Skill Injectors was released. Whatever CCP will decide, we just have to buy few injectors and apply... The stupidest decision of the millenia.
---
Funny thing, 2 guys can have at it about useless shit for hours, but we can agree on one thing.
---
Skill injectors ruined the game, but got CCP paid. i wish they would limit them in so many ways not just have it when and ever people want. but they wont. it makes too much money.
---
&gt; If a new Blackout happen one day, I hope that this time CCP will reflect on all ramifications. Or they remove the intel of BOTH sides at the same time, or they boost the rewards in nullsec to compensate the fact that preys won't have any efficient way to mitigate it, but not just shutdown the prey side... because as we saw, it effectively "shutdown" preys... 
---
people still mined, hell. when local went, i immediatly went out, bought 5 athanors, rigs etc. i was planning to mine my moons in blackout, PURELY because of blackout and cyno changes was a challenge, i wanted to do it, i wanted to know it worked. unfortuantly they ended blackout before my first pull xD
---
but travelling i my pilgrim to bring the cyno to bring it all home. i land in an enemy bubble. i declock, fuck fuck. oh wait. local. oh its empty.
---
in blackout, doing my non pvp things i got excited, and paniced. but then realised ccp turned the boring mode on (local) and knew i was fine and just slowboated to the gate 70km while i switched onto my other toon. this is where my passion comes from. i miss the panic that blackout gave, the challenge, and all the crys i hear about it just sound like 'im weak plez help' or people who just should not have in eve what they have.
---
Reintroduce the possibility of one-cycling structures again, and these thingies will see use even if a bit more expensive.
---
That's called war.
---
propaganda
---
Nah fam, thats me.
---
Trig guns typically cycle quickly but hold large quantities of ammo, so in theory no you’d be constantly boosting to keep up.
---
haha in this if you dont undock they just blow the station, but i dont want to spoil things.
---
/r/memesbannedinchina
---
I imagine that some of the logs are client specific. The server tells you that thing X happened and the client does Y, Z, and Q.
---
Also would probably make debugging a nightmare for support staff.
---
It's probably going to end up like Pirate dreads now. To exspensive to use for any thing other then a collection ship or supper safe ganking.
---
Only works until you have to go on reload, also only works if the cycle time is longer than the cap booster cycle time.
---
Not much of this matters when CCP doesn't give a crap about both the CSM or anyone's opinions other than their own.
---
Markets are NEVER destroyed so long as they exist. They are ALWAYS cyclical. Always. The only thing that might change is the wavelength of the cycle.
---
Even then we complained about CCP. You add a bunch of new regions to the game and they’re empty wastelands??
---
FC Where's The Undock Button: An NC. Story
---
Yeah... a bunch of wankers won't stop parroting some douche-nozzle using the word CONTENT over and over in place of FUN, and the phrase ISK Efficiency is being conjoined with complaints about botting, while prescribing it to be the fault of one nationality, as if that somehow isn't racist :/
---
Imagine feeling patronized by a word.
---
Proper shitposts now
---
I mean, being an asshole is still being an asshole regardless of the words used. So...
---
Eve  is already dead bro  accept it
---
"Local is primary"
---
Death by dino ascii art.
---
Or wtf ccp
---
Different right clicks
---
We shouldn't have t2 stuff drop.
---
Leave it how it is.
---
I think it shouldn't really change how things drop. Just have the current drops of X module be split amongst the sec area (or at least the sites and such) based on size, for deds, and then have just multiple in the faction stores for those.
---
Never met another player irl, I'll be there
---
Also the problem is how fast would the guns actually cycle and then add in tidi it mite take over an hour to ramp which surley be dead also lets not only think big
---
The ant-sub ramping will be awesome all fitting uses will go to tank and tracking whats the point for damage modes also whats gonna be the point of the other racial bonuses like armour repping?
---
&gt; Release blueprints to NPC vendors
---
Why are you suddenly changing how T2 stuff works?
---
YOU MUST BE THE DIRTY YANKEE, GERMANS WRITE IN CAPS.
---
agreed, the limitations really shit on a players ability to do other things but faction war fare for a specific side
---
I AM A YANKEE YOURE JUST MAD YOU LOST THE WAR
---
This was a sarcastic post usually, sadly too much smootbrains in this sub so you have to explain sarcasm by repeating facts that are known for years. Its like demanding a proof from me that the floor is actually wet after I said "Its raining".
---
Is that so? Nice...
---
They're not useless.  Someone will find a use for them.  Maybe you don't find a value in their increased stat, but I suspect you're alone in that regard.  Hell, Titans should be "useless" for PvE, but your alliance has no problems using them.
---
This is r/eve, where everyone is 100% serious and  everything is 100% facts.
---
v. cool
---
Yay for scannable traces, nay for dumb ass loot volume change
---
I see no way one could loot it now
---
This is also why they send out ridiculously underpowered patrols... they mined the ore themselves, so the ships are free.
---
I hope they use some sort of Triglavian jump fuel and stront. :evilgrin:
---
And then the doomsday’s fired, alphaing another titan off of the field.  The fleets sat there while the dictors busily popped more bubbles on their respective sides to prevent accidental warpoffs
---
This repeated for 14 hours until the defending side got bored and left, leaving the massive space station in its reinforced invincibility bubble and would not return
---
Riveting, movie when?
---
Need an r/eve safe space. Mean redditors making people feel bad about only having limited brain cells or an abnormal amount of chromosomes
---
I imagine it's to prevent people from ninja looting them in an industrial, now you need a freighter which is a lot more conspicuous.
---
Some of that footage looks strangely familiar O\_o.
---
I got goosebumps watching it.
---
There useless not because the bad but because there to expensive for what they can do.
---
The faction supers at least aren't gonna get nuked the second they try to do what there good at.
---
Yes titans should not be use for pve. At least unless the current ones. Should really be more for escalation's. But they can do why not , it's not like CCP would see the problem big people show why it's a problem.
---
I mean you can put the stickies thread on top every day, or hell it can be the only thread on here and people will still post separate threads.
---
Source; same questions every day about “I’m a new player how do I join a Corp” or whatever
---
no.. no its not.
---
god i hate that term.. Technically all mmo's are 'in the cloud'.
---
:(
---
Yeah, except your 500th shot is going to miss. RNJesus said so
---
Holy shit, players cooperating, CCPlz add yet more padding to the sandbox!
---
Dude you've never been to a WH right ? ^^
---
Fair point. But I feel like anyone playing eve and going to r/eve for questions/answers has probably played other games and visited the respective subreddits and should know how to use a basic search function.
---
But this is 2019, where gamers need that instant gratification and self-importance. 😃
---
Make! Eve! Safe! Again!
---
#1 underrated comment right here
---
&gt;Single cap booster
---
:Laughs in wormholer:
---
The dreads have appeared in abyssal sites for a while now. This isn't news.
---
So really what you're asking for isn't that the mods remove posts/comments that say "imagine" - but rather than they just remove posts by people who are "being an asshole." Because that's clearly something that's never open to interpretation whatsoever, depending on who the "victim" is.
---
400k m3...that means the ONLY way to deal with them is having titans on field and stand by to bridge freighters.
---
no
---
FW joining requires faction standing **without** skills. Hoover mouse on the faction to see what your base standing is.
---
That would break the mascarade.
---
yes, because 12 trillion in Jspace is = to 512 trillion in null. 
---
clearly all of the isk is fauceted in Jspace.
---
Yeah, but that caracal that the dread is dropping is certainly gonna feel that dmg in about 5 minutes.
---
No. I was just posting a silly one liner on a silly thread. Don't read so deep into it.
---
They're
---
Perimeter, as in the system?
---
Faction dreads just for there hull are like, 50 billon last I check, And there only slightly better with a unique bonus.
---
Marauders are 2 bill fitted compared to a well fit tech 2 bs being around 2 / 300 mill. but have tech 2 resistance and the powerfull bastion along with much better stats.
---
A jump frieghter is around 8 times that off a normal frieghter. But can travel 10 light year's in a second where a normal one needs to gate.
---
I don't knows but a slight bonus for 25 times the cost just is not worth it.
---
Are you a retard? Like seriously? I am talking with someone regarding bots and BO. You come in with your straw man argument changing the subject to how its ironic that Im stating assumptions are bad while making a assumption.
---
Like what is wrong with you? A diagnosis I need to know about?
---
If you have something to say about what me and the other guy was talking about, then present your argument. Dont try to win the argument by changing into something else, thats the definition of a what you are accusing me of.
---
Also, if you are stupid enough to think that all assumptions are equal then I have no fking idea what to tell you. Go bother someone else now.
---
Interesting, on hoboleaks there is also an item called [kredits](https://i.imgur.com/2S2iOOH.png) :ohdear:
---
\~\~PBUH\~\~
---
censored post ?
---
You do realize that the majority of people who roam Nullsec from a wormhole (C2/C3/Thera) cannot bring a dread in right? There are plenty of capital fights in wormhole space but they typically take place in c5s.
---
at the start the MC is asked to hold section 8 perimiter from the invaders. I think thats why its the title of the book.
---
/r/SelfAwarewolves
---
the book is a fiction with a MC, but i will laugh m y arse off if i find the arthour somehow added TiDi into the story somewhere, im only on book 2 so far out of 4
---
"why won't he feed a hostile fleet" is what you are saying.
---
Why would this be sent to the client?
---
he doesn't realize, because he's a fucking idiot.
---
That is exactly the point.... FW LP for FW pilots. We are tired of the very pirate groups we are fighting benefiting off the back of OUR work.
---
They should really make them more affordable. I mean, they are far from being OP and basically just gimmicky more than anything atm. Atleast make them cheaper so we can kill them.
---
Probably because youre a gweilo.
---
The chinese are subjected to hardline anti-westerner indoctrination in their culture. You can see it in the AoM/FRT conflict communications leaks too. One side not too subtlely accusing the other or being race traitors etc.
---
Yes that's the problem, why use a 50 bill dread when you can use 25 normal dreads.
---
He’s a bit slow
---
Wait what? Fishing for banners?
---
let's think other way round.
---
rep cooldown. or lock cooldown for logi
---
eg. you can't simply 24/7 just keep reps on one ship, but you'll be on cooldown after certain time.
---
**Best video you have made this year by far :)**
---
&gt; Edit: downvoted because I’m not rich fucks like you all. Nice
---
No, downvoted for wanting the deterioration of faction warfare to continue because it benefits you personally.  Navy ships aren't that expensive, if you're worried about cost in them you probably need to be taught better ISK-making methods.
---
Git gud. Only drooling smoothbrains mine in highsec. EVE isn't like other games where you need to grind for a long period in order to progress.
---
This is the best route. If you try to do everything on one char it will take you forever, thats why you have specialized chars. You can even create a new account and keep it in alpha, nowadays you get a lot of starter SP and you can put it in FW or NS or whatever to try things out without it affecting your main account. 
---
Cause if you stay long enough you are most likely gonna need a second account, might as well get a headstart on it.
---
Fuck snuff
---
He is a Bastion Alliance diplo mining in Delve who don’t need no Coalition Mandated Fits. Nevermind that Bastion has fountain space that they can use outside of the super umbrella where there are considerably less rules. In Fountain, you have to make the effort to save yourself, but can fit however you want and feed fountain core to your hearts content.
---
Since you mentioned the link to EVE I thought you were thinking about the system.
---
Ye no doubt. And everyone knows which one is gonna die the fastest. Both dreads and FAXs are as you say, highly expendable.
---
Maybe consider that they're less the police, and more the mafia?
---
&gt; Which are elected in a democratic fashion. CCP should never have allowed voting to be a thing, they should have picked out people themselves and rotated them around ensuring all aspects get heard. 
---
I have always been a fan of random lot systems. Actually, kind of wish my own government had a house that was chosen by lot.
---
Pussy ass bitches be whining more than normal, htfu everyone and go enjoy the game
---
if you don't want to fix your standings, join a corp already in FW.
---
you do know echoes is still under nda right? which means commenting and reposting could bring legal on your head.
---
Given the power of anticap forts and keeps (and sotiyos to an extent) These could only feasibly be used on medium structures. So idk really. Maybe for space cleanup after the owners are already gone.
---
I think your spot on 
---
Smaller teams perform
---
Larger teams debates 
---
Someone have to drive a meeting with a given agenda and clearly visible goals.  
---
I feel CCP use CSM as a focus group and have been since the start.  They do take input but more often then not they do as they please.
---
I have a life too, and *do* have billions upon billions of ISK in reserve, so clearly the life part isn't the problem, eh?  Also, nothing below battlecruiser even approaches 200m a pop, and only the Brutix Navy gets close to that number in the BC tier.
---
&gt; I do nullsec relic exploration, but that takes a while because Alphas don’t even get a fucking prototype cloak
---
Well, it's worth pointing out you're trying to regularly fly and lose moderately high-end ships on what basically amounts to a trial account.  That's kind of supposed to be hard.
---
That said, null explo is fine income, although you want to make sure you're in Sansha or at least Gurista space because they have the more valuable loot.  Low-class WHs can be lucrative as well, they spawn pirate sites and can sometimes have a pile built up that you'll rarely see in kspace.  You also want to try to get to more low-traffic areas of space, so there's less chance someone's come through and cleared sites recently.
---
it's no accident that he's called "cable"
---
Have you ever fought wormholers?
---
Huh, I like this.
---
Not to mention people have talked about their experience on reddit and elsewhere of their impressions of the game.
---
just saying, there is still an nda in place. be aware
---
I'm guessing those dreads will appear when the invasions will spread to nullsec. It would be great if CCP could add them in the form of a capital escalation, so you can't solo every site with a super. The more supers, the more npc dreads...we can only hope.
---
No, there is no way. The reason is, if you could cloak an alpha character every system in the game would have some alpha alt account sitting cloaked in it at all times.
---
Then buy a sub. This would be far too abuseable.
---
Nope
---
Most armchair generals usually never do because they don't have all the facts. That is not me trying to insult people who armchair it is just the nature of it.
---
Fair enough but if they wanted to sue someone they should sue the person who posted it in the first place. At any rate it's been available for awhile now.
---
Well then explain how rather than just saying that
---
except for when you cyno in bombers/dreads 3-4x a day anytime anything BS sized + undocks.
---
Not all of us have the money to
---
People who live there care enough to enforce very simple requests. Cop a shitty ass attitude and enjoy the resulting space lasers.
---
you didn't mention lp
---
PI/PP? Dunno what you mean by PP but I’m assuming by PI you mean like getting materials from planets; I thought Alphas couldn’t do that
---
Ok, so don't use it?
---
see what johndrees said above.  that's how.
---
Then give the cloak a timer; long enough to escape a bubble, but then it won’t be filled with AFK cloakers
---
Just give the cloak a timer
---
Belts can already be strip-mined until there's nothing left same with sanctums and Havens running out of enemies to shoot. I don't see any reason why everything else should have infinite resources completely passively
---
so you basically just found the solution to not only your problem but also to the so-called "problem" of cloaky camping.  congratulations
---
So why doesn’t CCP implement it if it would solve both problems lol
---
How did that go?
---
Orrrrrr, and hear me out, you could buy the game...
---
PP was CCP's rename for it last time they messed with it, it didn't really stick but I wanted to be clear in case you'd seen it mentioned in CCP materials.
---
I thought they gave that to alphas in the revamp but it looks like I was wrong.  Which I suppose makes sense, you could theoretically spool up near-infinite PI farms on alphas since they require so little logged-in time.  At any rate, you can run 5 planets apiece on your 3 characters per account with only a couple weeks of SP apiece, so if you do ever go Omega that's a good revenue stream to add in.
---
Then what are you crying about?
---
Don’t have money
---
Isn’t the game subscription based?
---
&gt; Why?
---
I think you missed something
---
Don't really know how you drew that conclusion, but okay.
---
Literally everyone I’ve met in-game has said that the prototype is shit and shouldn’t be used
---
I do agree with you 100%. I propose csm's purpose be changed for ccp's and their benefit.
---
Cool story bro
---
Perhaps you should question why one guy has so many people telling him the same thing?
---
i too enjoy this type of fit for lols on the occasion. lately ive been running it with structure tank as it get tons of hitpoints without the haste of lasting long enough to rep. really it depends on how close the incoming DPS is to peak reps. as the incoming dps gets decently greater than peak rep power, the longer you'll last vs larger gangs/amounts of dps. For me I'm usually whelping if im in a cane and that means larger amount of incoming dps. this make all the difference in getting that last kill or two and it burns to the ground xD
---
You got it in one. Since the information only matters when the ship in question does something that interacts with the world, the fact that information about it exists SHOULDN'T have any in game effect, so they SHOULD be able to send fake ones at will.
---
The server is the only place where the logs that differentiate need to exist.
---
Best idea would actually be a bit more complicated. How I would do it if CCP was to hire me.... 
---
Create a ghost fleet of bots that are capable of spawning anywhere they want. They roam around, just like a normal player fleet, even using a ceptor to scout. 
---
That is where the magic happens, because the bot will choose whether or not the scout or fleet will choose between "normal jump", "pre-send".
---
As such, this roaming fleet will run around gathering data on suspected bots, while providing a cover for the activity to prevent the bot developers from catching on too quickly.
---
Everyone complaining about capitals ruining the game.... CCP fucks up capitals balance even more with chaos changes...  proceeds to give players one more capital ship.
---
fine for you maybe.... sys k remembers :)
---
Or literally a frigate with webs
---
That was the problem. The weapons very clearly display their Meta level, so you know if you find a stack of Laser Mark 1 and then a few Laser Mark 5, that the 1's are vendor trash.
---
But there are no vendors to trash them. Just Sell orders that nobody will want.
---
&gt;Only will remain the High Sec agents with their lower payout, ending in practice FW missions as an isk printing machine.
---
You don't think that by severelly cutting the LP supply, you will raise the profitability of hisec agents? Although in that case all FW mission runners will fuck off to highsec, which will fix the problem
---
They did solve it with blackout.  Sadly the krabs would rather krab in peace than hurt botting. So here we are.
---
Waaah change game because I'm a high schooler and mommy won't pay for my sub
---
So how is that not fair, if said "Nick" puts in the work to steal the loot?
---
They do change their product around the feedback. I'm curious how many focus groups you've been involved with where the participants were told about changes being made in the room.   
---
Idk if you're a new player or just haven't really payed attention to the CSM minutes before... but CCP does take them seriously as a feedback source. It's not the only source, it's not the dominant source, it's not a decision making space. The CSM summits are also not the only interaction, it's an ongoing communication with devs. Granted, some years are better than others.
---
Sounds like what a little bitch would say.
---
so... wormholer btw?
---
He can still steal the loot just makes it harder to do
---
Your suggestions for improvement are comfy chairs and dry erase boards? Holy shit I'd want my money back. You should have just ended with lack of clear vision and no product owner force ranking the PBI by value. CSMs talking to a dev team is like asking the DMV for a forest service pass.
---
Exactly. Good enough for Brave but apparently not for Goons...
---
Brilliant.  
---
Can alphas also fly capitals too?
---
So you are saying Dunk is a clown and he should die (in-game)? 
---
See I also can reach arbitrary conclusions based nothing you said.
---
Oh I'm not saying people wouldn't use it or I wouldn't, just why ? You can by 25 normal dreads instead.
---
We do.
---
And you are missing a question mark, and possibly a semi-colon.
---
Happy to help :)
---
I don’t care.
---
If sleepers are there go somewhere else.  They are stronk.
---
You were still swimming in your daddies bollocks last time i lived with my parents dickhead. In fact i've probably got skid marks in my gruds that are older than you, you free loading cunt.
---
They can fly battleships, which feel like caps
---
Breaking the memory reading breaks bots and doesn't negativly impact legit players though. Blackout while fun was something that would never be able to stay around all the time. Adjusting it would have been better than rolling it back completely though. But that is ccp. Say you are going to work on iterating and making quick changes then sit on something for 3 months just to do nothing like what you said.
---
How it is now, there is no real risk to the person "ninja" looting it, while the group running it has to put capitals in a vulnerable state to run it. Its almost as if CCP wants people to work together and control the grid in order to extract the value of sotiyo instead of one person with a dst loot it.
---
It was to easy to do so before, the wreck being so big you could decloak loot an warp of well before any one could stop you.
---
So the ones running it just stopped bothering.
---
Just what this game needs; more caps.
---
In w space. Mass limits matter. So expensive stuff scales.
---
Because you freeloading self entitled alpha cunts are killing this game. The more you're given the more you demand. The more you get the less real people want to sub when they're paying for fuck all.
---
Its hard to get tangible proof of it happening when the sotiyos are rare and happen all over new eden, and when the loot is scooped before anyone can get in place to observe the wreck getting emptied.
---

Let me guess; communism has never really been tried?
---
Hello, sir. I believe you've mistakenly applied data to an argument without thinking it through.
---
Divide the 12,000,000,000,000 by the amount of wormholers. Keep this number. This number is the generated ISK per character in wormholes. Now do the same with the 512,000,000,000,000 but divided by the amount of nullseccers. Keep this number. This number is the generated ISK per character in nullsec.
---
Congratulations! If you've completed these easy steps you should have two numbers that paint a much clearer picture of the "problem" represented here.
---
You've obviously met a lot of incompetent players.
---
I agree rootEVE .. WreckingShot is an IDIOT!
---
No.

Then every nullsec system would have 25 cloaky campers.

Yeah I remember taking my Myrmidon to fight some; after a long fight I killed them

What are the minimum requirements for doing solo emerging conduits in highsec? I'm using a Cormorant but it's not enough, those rats are tough! What type of ship should I use? Cruiser? Battlecruiser? I'm alpha

An advanced cloak means nothing. It's just a slightly less shitty cloak.
---
Fair
---
It has niche uses.
---
Like while you wait for other things to train.
---
Wait fuck I’m retarded; I meant improved
---
Did you read the minutes? They didn't think people super or titan rat using bots. How could they not be aware of that? That shows they aren't putting any real effort into combating bots. Whatever detection and prevention tactic they use have not changed in a very long time if they aren't even considering the idea of super botting.
---
I don't think blackout was done to disrupt bots. It was just a positive side effect of it. If that was the goal they would have done more to keep it inplace or to at least spent that 3 months coming up with an alternative. Instead they did nothing.
---
Eh, I suppose

CCP needs a health &amp; diet program for their CSM members....

Must have been a false positive. Don't you just love censorship?

Your use of words is not OK, even though you meant it in a completely innocent way!  It hurts my innocent ears and eyes if I hear/see the bad words! Save me from the bad people because my skin isn't thick enough to ignore words from random people I don't know on the internet!

&gt;It is grueling, conflict-ridden, slogging work to slowly, over months and sometimes years, to finally get the arrogant shits that run IT shops to realize the damage that they personally have been doing to their own companies for years. Sometimes decades.

Happy Cake Day!

If u have only an hour its a waste of time to play to plex ur account.
---
Play Faction warfare it will give u some fun and maybe even enough isk to buy plex.
---
If so, why are you accusing someone of scripting without any "*tangible proof*"?
---
Pre-paid debit cards usually have restrictions against using them on overseas purchases (CCP is based in Iceland). However, I've gotten around that by buying the subscription on Amazon. 
---
Also, you can pay for a subscription using in game money earned from PVE activities.
---
InDePeNdEnT AlLiAnCe
---
They are not entirely wrong, it is shit, and given a choice, you should probably pony up and use the better one. 
---
However, you are missing a lot of the picture. It is used. Its cheaper, and its easier to manufacture, and uses less skills. Yes, you shouldn't prefer them for any reason other than price, and the difference of a couple of mil is seldom a big on a ship fit.
---
What may be a factor is availability and current skills. Prototype cloaks fill market needs and give people a trainer cloak that is more available than the advanced version. Anybody can buy a BPO and start mass producing prototype cloaks, but production of advanced cloaks requires an invention process to make blueprints and then requires the advanced materials.... on top of the prototype cloak, which is a production input.
---
This is why they are quite abundant at trade hubs, and find them less well seeded throughout the universe as compared to prototypes....even though the prototypes are shit and you probably shouldn't use them if you can avoid it.
---
The only person this change affects is you. You have no idea how long I've waited for this to be finally implemented, and how much pleasure it gives me to see you stopped.
---
Perhaps I'll just consult an interior designer next time I want to change the look of my office.
---
People need sp
---
This I *kind of* agree with, risk that came with a Sotiyo ninja looting attempt was indeed quite small
---
all good brother errr I mean grrr gon hat gon
---
I mean wouldn’t nullsec explo be a better income source even with only an hour to play?

Oh okey. Thanks for the update!

Can I be on a list? I like it when I'm on lists. Lists are fun to be on. I should make a list. I'll put you on my list if you put me on yours.
---
I'll pm ya. Cheers!
---
Hey, you still had the guts to post your idea on this sub, which is starting to look more like Monte Kali every day I spend here. You're also willing to admit that you might be wrong instead of declaring how everyone's problems will be solved if CCP just listened to you.
---
Keep having ideas, keep taking criticism, and keep learning. I think that's all any of us can ask of each other.
---
So a pre-paid debit card wouldn’t work since I’m in the U.S?
---
Anyway, I’ll probably just devote a good amount of time to nullsec explo to plex my account; it’ll suck ass but whatever; how long does it take to train up to advanced cloak anyway?
---
I mean, I dont think it would be worse than the current system we have.
---
As someone who never experienced what outposts and POS' were like, can someone give me an explanation?
---
They need to bring in Trig Fax soon too
---
I think I'm not being clear enough, so let me try to recap in a single comment:
---
Before the implementation of my proposed system (patchday) have NPC vendors sell blueprints for all sizes of mods, but until patchday you can't produce those new mods. These blueprints can be sold in hisec, no need to restrict that. You can still invent/research as you wish, so blueprints for TII new mods will be available by patchday.
---
When patchday hits, all existing mods get resized, and the production of TII mods is enabled. It means that already on patchday, you can have industrialists churning out TII new mods. For the rest of the blingier versions, you can then obtain deadspace lights in hisec, medium and heavy in lowsec/null.
---
No retouching of invention, blueprints or TII dropping from anywhere!
---
 Hope it's all clear :)
---
Yeah you need to join a corp and get region intel, have another alt scout ahead, watch dotlan, check region stats before travel (ships killed, jumps, etc) - basically up your intel game before traveling.  Then, sometimes you get blown up anyway.  Solo roaming nullsec blind is going to end in tears.  A cloak would help with that sort of thing a little, but if you jump into a bubble - you're gonna have to decloak to burn out of it, or just sit there cloaked until they get bored and lose interest and hope something doesn't decloak you.  As far as gate camps you'll also have to decloak to align warp, or again wait cloaked until they lose interest and hope you dont get decloaked or AOE'd.  Personally I don't bother with non covops cloaks because of this sort of thing, but they have their (many) uses, including the prototype cloak.
---
yeah like trading a few DST for faction caps is never not worth.
---
yea nullsec exploration worst thing u can do with 30hours per month... It will take you like an hour to make 100mill with alpha skills and you might die fast with no cloak. 
---
You want to play this game like most of the people? To earn monthly plex and do only pve?
---
This is stupid. Let people steal from each other.
---
The Maila keepstar got stolen in front of a Horde dread and loki fleet. I'm sure someone will nab an armored cache.
---
Cloaky camping is used to get around third party intel systems that warn PVE players to hide before threats arrive in system. While that sounds nice, in practice perfectly safe ratting both causes stagnation and is an isk faucet that increases inflation. Particularly when botters are taken into consideration. It's a highly controversial discussion topic.
---
Also, your "solution" would fuck over stealth bombing fleets, who often have to wait cloaked up in big battles until an opportunity to bomb presents itself.
---
It doesnt increase risk for the one who steals, it completely removes the ability to steal. 
---
It negates the risk for blobs to get their stuff stolen. 
---
It incredibly increases the difficulty to run them without being part of a blob, to the point where you need multiple titan bridges, a freighter alt on top of the players and assets you need to actually run the site. And you probably need all the above within enemy space.
---
This will give nullblobs the monopoly on sotiyo loot and nerf small independent entitys yet again.
---
This is no court. This is an online-game.  
---
TL;DR: No proof needed for accusations.
---
Alphas can’t have multiple chars up so I can’t have an alt Scout
---
My shitty computer probably couldn’t even handle it anyway lol
---
Took a fight that we weren’t guaranteed to win, which is probably a foreign concept to a lot of people here
---
Because everyone who's better than me at anything can't possibly be doing it without the aid of cheats, duh.
---
Aren't trig weapons one size larger than what we are familiar with? small are actually medium, medium are actually large and large are actually extra large?
---
like frig/DD use medium
---
cruiser/BC use lerge
---
battleship uses XL
---
see this is the problem with this subreddit.
---
Take a fight. One side loses and gets blamed for being bad.
---
No one takes the fight, this reddit blames them for being cowards.
---
The eternal cycle continues
---
I'll scout you out for a price. Payable once you get the loot to Jita.
---
I dont believe in the good thoughts of this act. I am sure that the CEOs of these corporations have large capitals of fractional assets. And they just want good prices in the market. This holyshit for good gameplay - is lie. Just killing factional wars for solo players. Solo players now just stop selling them their junk in Amarr.   
---
omg 4-6 people decided that we do not play eva correctly. I hope the caldari don't think of such shit
---
Tackle it.
---
That is what generates income, just like convincing someone they need your services. However, I don't think that agile has a correct to it. That's sort of what it is about. 
---
My work sounds like this: We aren't doing agile correct  please help us. 
---
My response is "you really can't do it wrong. You're probably fine."
---
They say "We aren't and it is terrible."
---
I have never told anyone they were doing agile wrong. But I have told them their meeting was a total waste of time and an exercise in dominance rather than work.
---
So you are the guy that thought having no table at the group 3 day training would make people pay more attention and get closer together.  I really hate that guy in my work.
---
Everyone hates them.  They only say oh wow that is a good idea because they need to put some more bull on a report for how they improved the business.  
---
I learned nothing from the training, except that it is a waist of time and the best way they could reduce costs would be to fire that guy!
---
Then you dont understand that he actually ran sotiyos himself. In fact he ran more of them himself behind enemy lines than sotiyos he stole the loot from. This also wont really be possible anymore. The chance of a sotiyo spawning in a system under the influence of a blob is also a lot bigger than the opposite as the majority of null is under their control. Like legacy would have like what? 8 regions to safely run them in? If you want to run them behind enemy lines you will need titan alts around the universe and have to hope for a spawn within dead regions.
---
Oh no
---
CCP hasn’t given you a freighter with the same slot layout/fitting specs as a rorqual?
---
It's possible to have fun, and not worry about fake killboard scores. GSF used to embody that.
---
I swear, this subreddit is one of the most bitter places I've ever seen. Not without cause, mind you, but it's still a big turnoff.
---
As far as SKINS are concerned...really, how hard would it be for the devs to use something like Warframe's cosmetics system? Color palettes, patterns for each ship, no "limited-time" SKINs aside from seasonal and/or event-exclusive versions, and - most importantly - REASONABLE. PRICES.
---
Well, it's good to know Ex-CCP still use's CCP's dev methods.  IE, pitch old technology as something new and exciting years after it's the norm.  Bet they think balancing once every 2 years is the way to go, too.
---
Took a fight, knowing being outnumbered. Tried some ballsy tactics. vOv
---
Unlike most fucks do these days.
---
They have exactly one combat use that I have seen, home defense/honer brawls in wormholes. In that situation you can both afford it and can expect it to not get instantly nuked. It is still a vanity item even then but at least there they are occasionally used.
---
It kind of reminds me of walking into motorcycle gear shops and seeing the novelty helmets that have no hope of actually doing anything useful in a crash and the little dish of "DOT Approved" stickers for sale at the counter.
---
Some people care more about saving a few bucks or avoiding a ticket than actually protecting their real life brain from the real life pavement. Seems c heaping out on a cloak is exactly the choice people want to make.
---
People just relate chinese players and botting as synonyms more than other players, in poor taste obviously but the problems of botting have been far and wide longer and impacted on TQ before the players from Serenity got over here.
---
Everybody just blame the likely suspects because that is what our community media has doctored onto us to think.
---
Fact of the matter is the chinese players are just behind on the meta game of hiding their side of illicit activity in game because it was such an openly known and accepted concept on serenity. 
---
However, the botting problem could still be far more contributed by non-chinese/non former serenity players who have been on TQ the whole time and have the benefit of keeping their activity as low key as possible and they are just taking advantage of the stigma around chinese players to point the blame and attention away from themselves.
---
\&gt;and a wreathe
---
wut?
---
Screw that, you can build twenty five for half the cost
---
Oo shit, I think I should've known that. My bad
---
eh they really arent obligated to tell us why, but i wish just for the sake of the game's health they iterated on all these projects they began over the years and kinda just...left...
---
Read the last angel on spacebattles
---
oh no they took a fight and lost some spaceships!
---
Haha look at these idiots fighting with spaceships instead of multiboxing rorqs under a super umbrealla. It's like they don't know what EVE is.
---
It's kinda sad seeing people shoot down ideas not because they're bad, but because they know CCP can't be bothered to take the dev time to do something.  Even something relatively easy to do.  That says a lot about the really, really sad state of CCP right now.
---
Mmhm!
---
You have my downvote
---
Nope, I am not that guy. I'm the guy you love who kills the three day meeting.
---
I am the guy who wanted to look at the content of the last three day meeting, map out how it went, and figure out a way to make it a one hour meeting that doesn't need a table next time, so that everyone is in and out as quickly as possible with as little wasted time and energy as possible.  I'm the guy that advises your boss to time himself and STFU and stop ranting for an hour in a weekly staff meeting which you grudgingly attend.
---
Ok your hired
---
Good for him if he ran them, this doesn't stop him from running them, it just increases the danger of running them.
---
Why does needing a freighter make these impossible to run.
---
Also if he ran them in enemy space what difference does it make if legacy owns more space? You don't even understand what the term 'umbrella' means. It refers to an area that is covered by a super cap fleets jump range. Not 2 jumps or 10 jumps or whatever it is from TESTs home to the edge of Cache. These were not run with titan alts, these were titan mains moved around to kill them, exposing those fleets to risk. 
---
Seriously, this is the most insane debate I have had on this subreddit. You believe risking a freighter makes these easier to run. Forget evreything else, about who is doing them. Break down that for me, how is using a freighter less risk than a DST?
---
You're not going to make 3b a month playing 1 hour a day. Maybe if you had a high SP account, but not as an Alpha.
---
Trig Guns dont miss :P
---
Red neck standing by
---
FRIENDSHIP!   ...is what I would say, if I had any friends.
---
All things change for better or worse, they get better, get good, they get bad, then they get worse and then it all starts to get better again after hitting bottom. Nothing lasts forever and even our best efforts to reach our farthest goals can put us farther behind than we were in the beginning. Nobody truly controls their destiny but we will always be to blame for our fate. Before the end, it will all seem so inevitable yet we cannot resist ourselves to choose differently.
---
And if it was blue the DST can dock just as well. And in your theoretical it not requires a titan and a freighter and those both combine to be less risk than a DST?
---
Thanks, I got that feeling from a lot of the messages... 
---
I tried to come up with solutions to streamline the transition as much as possible and to require the least development hours, I hope this gathers a bit more traction
---
Wouldn't you like to know
---
Emerging counduit question. I haven't played since before start of summer. My main has 90m SP. Assume emerging conduits in high sec are something I can do easily with a decent fit ship? I'm off on medical at the moment and just really looking for something "low effort" to stretch my brain and such and not take 2 hours. I'm guessing most of what I have available is rattlesnake, Tengu, Machariel. I saw a few Praxis fits so that would be an option as well. On the right track? When I logged in there was 15 or so in the system I was in.
---
NC committing to a fight, that is a foreign concept.
---
Level 4 sites in high sec are, I think, weird. That's the scanning difficult (I know that much) but I don't know how that effects the drops. The pirate sites I see are almost always level 1-3. 
---
As I understand it, there's some sort of sliding scale to high-low-null sites. High gets the smallest sites, low gets medium, null gets largest, but I think that you still get high sec sites in low and null, and still get low sec sites in null. 
---
Wormhole space (once again, I think) gets all of them, but you also get wh sleeper sites, and the sites that appear in wh space are random instead of region specific.
---
 Yeah, go to wormhole space. Relic sites tend to be worth more, not less.
---
I hear you folks saying that CSM meetings are not there to set tasks and timelines, I really do. But my takeaway from that is "CSM is not supposed to be very productive by design".
---
Guess that's understandable for what started as PR stunt.
---
Instead of being carried through one?
---
They are not useless, they have been used on occasion as a powerful force multiplier in high class wormhole brawls.
---
Really massive blue donut isn’t a problem? Only RMT and botting? Fucking smooth brain
---
I'm guessing to get the next real combat scenario the value of loot from specific factions will need to change. If another area of space becomes more valuable than delve/fountain it's likely the imperium would go take it.
---
It was a great fight, leaving asides the memes and all that, it was one of the big fleets I've enjoyed the most.
---
We outnumbered with alts.
---
They outnumbered with mains.
---
dont sell into buyorders like a smoothbrain and you only lose your ship if you are really fucking retarded
---
Does anyone have a full list of everything they've started and left unfinished since the game began? I know there's supposed to be a lot, but I've never seen a clear list of how much there actually is.
---
there are a lot of ways this could be made to work and aslong as it's a actual price worth more than the SP that have to be destroyed, i doubt people will game the system.
---
Maybe 300k m3, let's jf's get it atleast. That's 10 bil risk so I'd say that's fair.
---
depends on your context of "unfinished". Otherwise go through the past few years of patch notes and search for the string "Will be iterated on later" or something like that.
---
I'll give it a look; there's a C2 and a C4+ hole right next to my highsec home point, but quite reliably in highsec at least data sites have more money than relic sites.  Even the absolutely tiny data sites are 2-3 mil each, which is more than the five relic sites I found here that probably totaled less than a million in loot.
---
I'll keep you posted, and will probably record my foray into the hole(s) as proof of my claims.  Though I wouldn't be surprised if there is a link between scanning difficulty and loot quality.
---
Well, *that's* gonna take a while...
---
exactly
---
As I understand the magic wand waving woo woo bullshit, it's a nano-bot system that specializes in a particular function.   For example, a thermal hardener would be tiny bots adapted for harsh temperatures, or armored little bots for kinetic/explosive.  Kinda like a high end intake mod on a car.  We just lack the current technology to make that mod fit on a semi.

Lul you’re really doing something with your life, enrolling in mandatory levels of education and playing a video game. Don’t forget us little guys when you make it big
---
I wasn’t aware AP classes were mandatory where you live
---
This is what we call risk and reward
---
Oh noes, was hoping it would take them longer to implement this new system. Muh escalation interception (o´･_･)っ
---
Hope it will still be doable somehow. @Krabs pls adapt without adding any infosec to the process of buying escalations
---
And a normal dread probly would off done the same job just as well.
---
Nice vid.  Vids like these make me miss Eve sometimes.
---
Don't try to fit a ship for fighting and exploration at the same time. What you'll end up with is a ship that's not good at either fighting or exploration.
---
You want to go exploring. Fit a cov ops frigate. You want to go fight then fit a ship specifically for that. Hybrid builds just don't work.
---
A new copy pasta in the wild boys. Get your discord bots ready.
---
Wow AP classes?? Next thing you know they’ll be handing you your doctorate
---
I looked it up. Sites are region specific. High sec sites just appear in high sec, low sec sites just appear in low sec, and null sec site just appear in null/wh space. The sec level of the site effects how many containers appear, high sec gets least, null/st gets most. The type of containers that appear depends on scanning difficulty (level of site) with high levels getting better cans. 
---
So a high sec level 4 would have a low number of cans, but a high probability of them being good cans. There's 3 levels of cans, the higher the level of can the more likely it has better loot.
---
Ok you just have to cover a what was it 85km sphere with dictors? You just need or 32 dictors to cover that surface area assuming you arrange them perfectly. How can you not see how absurd that is?
---
Could be reached by just making the remote reps more cap-demanding.
---
I mean considering how I’ve consistently gotten high grades in all my AP classes, and scored high on the SAT, I basically got my pick of whatever college I want
---
This is EVE, not a MOBA
---
Wait, what?  They are gonna limit dreads to a single cap booster too?
---
Or just have the dps scale per siege cycle with a cooldown
---
Yeah they do? The don't have good tracking
---
Fucking dope video man, that just hyped me to restart making some again. Nice music choice
---
love the goon in the south ratting in his blue umbrella, giving shit to an alliance for undocking and taking a fight with similar/less numbers.
---
Just wait, Mittani will tell you when you can undock and blob and spin it as "GF"
---
Goons don't undock unless 5:1 odds right?
---
its true my ego is quit large
---
deposit it without docking in a hostile citadel and then asset safety it out. Who cares about the cost of the freighter itself?
---
how would you calculate that statement...  did u do a petition?
---
Thanks, that sounds like a good summary of what I had pieced together so far.
---
Honestly, I think that Citadels aren't a *bad* idea, but they shouldn't be something alliances and corporations can put everywhere with no restrictions. Historically speaking, a [citadel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel) was the defensive core of a city, like the keep of a castle. Those weren't slapped down everywhere someone pleased, the builders had to pick and choose their location.
---
A Epiathal can’t fit a cov-ops cloak.
---
Ah
---
First thing’s first. Find your local CODE agent, acquire your mining permit, familiarize yourself with the New Halaima Code of Conduct, and accept James 315 as you saviour and supreme protector.
---
Adding another long-term project to my list. EvE is taking up a whole lot of my time.
---
Being unhappy is a prerequisite for playing eve
---
Hmm seems like a trap
---
Suggestion: Stop suggestions.

---
I wish toonblob was better at being villains.
---
Nothing is next. This is it.
---
You will never find a more honourable pilot in new eden than one who flies under the banner of James 315!
---
Praise James!!
---
Ill check up on that tomorow some time, only thing we can think of is when a self admittedly toxic guy who has since left was made recruiter for a week or so by accident. Sad to hear it was a bad experience if it was indeed us. 
---
All the other guys listed are good people so please check them out if you're not interested in checking us out again :)
---
But I already am a member of a mighty corp
---
i like your optimism. wish i still had it.
---
Oh no, you don’t need to join the CODE. You just need to get your mining permit and accept James 315 in to your heart.
---
Are you dense? I know how tackling works. Tackling a dst stabbed dst means you have to catch it in a bubble then scram it so it can't MJD. Or hit it with like 3 navy scrams. So explain to me how you are going to cover the entire surface of the huge lootable surface area with scrams.
---
han ok thanks :)
---
And people don't. Because they're shit. Which has already been said.
---
If they’re cloaked then it’s impossible to get them, unless you combat probes them when they were decloaked. Idk what these people are talking about, the only way to get decloaked is if you just warp to a celestial at 100/0 and then don’t move at all. Even just warping cloaked to one celestial and then bouncing to a different one is enough
---
Trefiddy
---
everyone is StainGuy's alt
---
That’s... actually fair. A good set up should not be wasted. But still, you also need to give credit where due.
---
I’ve been listening to Winter World by A.G riddle which is really good. It’s not way too sci-fi (or anything like eve tbh) but it’s a great read if you like space ships
---
&gt;Are you dense? I know how tackling works.
---
Obviously not.
---
Literature Role Playing Game. Probably.
---
&gt; Obviously not.
---
I just explained to you what is needed to tackle a dst and you are still telling me i don't know what tackle is and how it works. So yes you are about as dense as it gets.
---
Thank you for the kind words!
---
1. I'm not offering this as as service, or promoting that I do this as a management consultant. 
---
2. Business/product owners should talk to customers. This group is far too large to have developers wear both hats and would be a potential cause for why there is no clear vision.
---
They simply respawn and you go again. What if, if you strip mines 100 belts, the asteroids that use to be 10,000 m3, are now 9,000 m3.. and after several months of mining, the system is basically shit. This makes resources not infinite. Alliances need to move to new regions to get fresh rock. Moving creates conflict. Conflict upsets the blue donut, which makes eve pilots happy
---
Neither have i, but i can see how these systems interact logically.
---
You're welcome. Glad I could make your day better, even if it was only a little bit. :)
---
Serious question from a newbie.
---
How do those huge ass battles even go down? Like, literally just have a shot caller telling you who to target?  I was always curious into possibly getting into a big battle like that maybe one day... but I just do exploration right now, tucked away invis majority of the time in wormholes. Lol
---
Those battles just look like a huge cluster... probably fun though.
---
OP might be engaging in self-fellatio, but most of this (I didn't read it all tbh) is pretty standard good advice. 
---
Pointless meetings are a huge time suck.
---
'bout trefiddy indeed my brotha
---
The way I see it, if nothing changes, then nothing is going to happen. Either CCP needs to cause conflicts in some way or some large betrayal/drama/something will need to take place for any major wars to take place.
---
I think if the same percentage of pilots and entrepreneurs were failing at their job we'd have a lot more plane crashes.

---
Why? Who's gonna win? Tell me, tell me!
---
The funny part is a guy I was talking to about it also said it's possible internal fighting could cause issues
---
did you manage to bring it to safe ?
---
Not much, just the places with a sec status ending with .0
---
Lol:)
---
Ye, nobody wants to take responsibility for anything. Not even those with power. Feels like all of Europe is like this, just look at EU.
---
They appear to be shooting nerds. Lots and lots of nerds. That is what that BR tells me.
---
Tried that, name doesn't exist mate
---
They didn't specify FAX or Dread, but I believe the context was something along the lines of, "add capital cap boosters to a list of modules of which there is only 1 allowed per ship" (e.g., Triage, Siege, etc.). This list to the best of my knowledge is not dependent on ship type.
---
I got a naglfar i got from a buddy just before he ehm went "KIA"
---
I don't do team building. I think teams are built when coworkers believe in each other's ability to perform. No trust falls. Meetings should be working sessions. As long as there is product from the meeting yes, if not no. Stand-ups can be useful for fast paced daily work to keep a team together in software, but only if strictly time limited and held to discipline to keep them fast. Not that you care, but I don't do what it sounds like you have been subjected to.
---
The problem is that at this point in the games life cycle it becomes clearer every year that the CSM is just a customer service mouth piece designed to give lip service to players and convince them the company still cares when in fact they could not possibly care less then they do right now and have no intention of changing that mind set. Hilmar has checked out entirely to the point that he has already found a new company to buy a large stake in and is simply hanging around CCP headquarters waiting to collect his sale bonus check from PA. And Falcon isn't helping because has no idea what to do at this point so he simply follows along behind hilmar like that yappy little dog your grandparents own barking when ever hilmar tells him to hoping that buys him enough good will that when he leaves he takes falcon with him. Everyone keeps making jokes about Eve dying but the sad truth is its already dead, CCP just hooked the body up to a life support machine and are now making their way out of the hospital  while the players all stand around the comatose patient hoping for miracle that isn't coming and PA is going to have to be the bearer of bad news who explains they are pulling the plug over the next few months with the release of a huge number of new pay to win mechanics and items.
---
I think it's the rare spawns in relic sites that make them worth so much. A single can can have a 14 stack of intact armor plates in it, which is worth a lot. More cans means more chance of that happening more often.
---
a 14 stack?  Most I've ever gotten of blue salvage ever is one or two of them, and I can count the times that's happened on one hand.
---
you seem to have not even read what i said, this is for people that are already ahead and in a nullsec sov alliance, at that point you shouldent be needing to catch up.
---
For those of us who arent as sharp, what is this
---
No offence but I don't think you know what you're talking about. Removing logs would change literally nothing.
---
try again, slowly this time
---
1.0 and -1.0?
---
so instead of just feeding those that are already ahead they should have to actually do something that is hard to do!
---
thx cap. u can stay in sell orders a few month and jerk -0,01 isk every 5 min 24/7 if u want. 70-80k LP for tier4 with 5 lvl skill "combat connections"
---
I said the debit card itself, not amazon; do *you* have a reading issue?
---
That's not how trig guns work. A charge is used every time the gun starts up. Once started it keeps cycling without using additional charges
---
It looks like ccp is going to be giving away isk like they do other random things ie accelerators/skins/skills for login rewards
---
That makes them useless for debugging actual problems.  "5 minutes before the crash this happened" doesn't tell you why it crashed.
---
Not for emerging conduits. You can definitely rat other combat anoms in a frig/cruiser.
---
nah just chasing butterflies
---
A fucking prepaid debit card would work fine on Amazon IN THE US, that's what the second sentence means.
---
This!
---
It is for 90% of activities
---
So begins the age of disposable dreadnaught brawls
---
Correction: 5 titans to each 1....there that's better.
---
&gt;Breaking the memory reading 
---
It should be noted that this is impossible.
---
The person running the bot has root access to their machine.  You can not hide the contents of memory from them.  Nor can you detect anything they do not want you to detect.
---
They literally control the kernel.
---
Yep defo impossible to steal things that require a freighter to scoop
---
https://youtu.be/9LdXH5V9MUE
---
Lmfao ECM burst the dread. Reset the damn ram up everytime
---
Ok. Let's play that out. If elected I ask ccp what decisions we will be making in the meeting, they say none, then I say I quit. Can we just skip to the end and say I already quit? Because that was my point. No one should be willing to go there for three days to do this unless it is some sort of super fan experience I dont understand.
---
Nope... Modules have durations, modules have ranges, modules have effects. You don't get to decide how much your Nos or Neut drains. If you turn it on, it drains what it drains.
---
The cycle time and cooldown are a balance mechanic. Being able to fire it more often would be too much.
---
Positioning your booshers to split enemy groups is a skill. You are asking for that skill to just straight be removed and to empower booshing (a already pretty strong strategy.)
---
Where you want to run them depends on a ton of factors. Faction, risk, isk, convenience, etc. I have setups for each faction but I generally run minmatar l5s in a pocket next to the war zone. I'm not blue with anyone in the area but I don't have an issue since I'm smart and careful.
---
Moongoo isn't being alchmised.  It's being traded in Jita.  As is ice.  And nobody's "hitting the convoys".
---
So making even more stuff be traded in Jita isn't going to suddenly make people hit convoys.
---
&gt;That's why you seed fake data 
---
The client has to know which data is fake, or the client will be showing it to the player.
---
If the client knows which data is fake, the bot knows which data is fake.  Because they have absolute control of the machine the client is running on.
---
&gt;WoW memory bots have been eliminated
---
I've got some bad news for you....
---
I think the nose-diving player numbers speak the loudest for which "crowd" is right.
---
That's exactly what I was looking for. I don't mind spending a few 0.01 iskies to not have to sit there and add up how many more I need and buying 10+ times per item
---
Fighting memory reading bots is an arms race. You can do things like add a fake and if the client follows up on the fake you know it’s reading memory and you can ban the account. Then the guys who wrote the bot add fake detecting code and doesn’t work anymore. Then you write smarter or different fakes and the thing starts over again. Your hope is that what costs them with the bans you issue and the changes they need to make is greater than what they make bottling but in a game like eve in which new accounts and alts are so easy to roll, I don’t know.
---
Elicit?
---
i've seen a few caimans ratting, but Goons......lol
---
Sorry, I had to remove your post because your reddit account is under 2 days old. Feel free to message the mods via modmail to get that sorted. Thank you for your understanding!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Eve) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
Ah yes, it's the fault of the players for playing optimally, not the developers being boneheads.
---
I'm Red Leader. Ask Paedrigh McDonough.
---
yes that is right.. the gates.. in wormhole systems... we block them...
---
*sigh\**
---
Well this also might encourage a fight over grid control instead of just welping a bunch of dst's... Which to me would be more entertaining than playing whack a mole with looters
---
Lol, Goons won't give you a fair fight. They will drop caps on a venture.
---
To be fair, it's the same thing everywhere. Just that in EU we like to be perfectly fucking sure we have to make the call ourselves because nobody else can.
---
Is this abyssal space?
---
i have a massive deja vu right now 
---
i could swear i already saw this before , maybe not with the memes but the "stealing the rattle "and everything
---
I mean the chat logs buddy, that way people can't use log scrapers like near2 to instantly get an alert from the other room or something that somethings up, would actually have to have people being at the keyboard for up to date intel
---
Nope. Unless they were being a right prick about things.
---
While not violating nda, cause i want to play more. i will say it was alpha so obviously not everything will happen as it should. limited players, so full release should address this.
