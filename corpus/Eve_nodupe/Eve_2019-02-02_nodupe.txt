Asking me how many years it spans suggests that you’re not interested in having a conversation about it based on anything besides mindless droning.
---

---
I answered that argument already.
---
---
---
I don’t know about that, just wanted to point out accurate description.
---
So what I managed to fish out of this is:
---
CCP is full of shit because they changed their policies between wizardhat and gigx
---
Orvolle, not far from Couster, and has gates to both low and null, the Fed Navy station is pretty well stocked. 
---
I can  guarantee that a decent percentage of this sub knows exactly where it comes from.
---
Wouldn’t the attempted anchoring of the NC KS say otherwise? 
---
*Ackshually
---
Double cycle time but half cost? I mean if we're shit posting may as well go full autism 
---
Wew.
---
Beebrain is *strong*.
---
Read it again. Then maybe read it a second time, since you didn’t bother reading it the first time.
---
Thanks.
---
Yeah i agreed with his initial points and explanations.
---
His suggestions arent.. bad, they just dont hit the root issue with capitals.
---
I do agree that HAW have no place on Titans and should be dread only weapons. Not because they're "OP" but because titans are the largest ships in the game and have no business shooting subcaps.
---
Its a similar dynamic with battlecruisers and never being bonused to rapid light missile launchers. Battlecruisers have no business fitting and being bonused with an anti-frigate weapon as theyre supposed to be a counter to cruisers. I would view Titans and HAW the same way. They should strictly be XL weapon focused.
---
their poster use is to bash structures, but they're hot trash at that
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
you can bomb with them.... and that's it really
---
dreads are the last thing that need a hard nerf atm
---
Nope that's pretty much what you said.
---
Because old policies that got mittens a temp ban and your friend a permaban changed and got gigx banned without getting mittens banned retroactively, CCP is full of shit.
---
Actually everybody hated Goons but nobody had the balls to try and take them on. It wasn't until the spectacular failure of the Viceroy program and Low Sec Voltron kicking in Goons teeth that people were like "hey, maybe this will work."
---
So they started fucking with goons, some more people joined in, seeing how easy it was. The casinos then started bankrolling people to hit SMA, who Goons decided to try and bail out in the midst of all this.
---
Queue more spectacular failures, and more people joining in. Most of the people who hit the CFC did so voluntarily, after seeing the giant bleed. Any isk was just an added bonus, and an easy way to create a broad coalition.
---
Tl;Dr the catalyst was the CFC getting shit on by low seccers. Most alliances joined in as volunteers to help dismantle the CFC, isk was a bonus and a way to say "we're on the same team", not a driving force.

Read. It. Again.
---
You look like an illiterate moron right now because I didn’t say that they “changed the policy.” I’m not mad that they “changed the policy.”
---
I clearly explained why, and you’re insistent on repeating something that literally only you said.
---
not sure why my monitor is getting so much attention (it's just 2 monitors without the bezel) but here's some of the eve backgrounds I use  [https://imgur.com/a/Q7xoyjO](https://imgur.com/a/Q7xoyjO) they're a bit amateur hour hour but if you like them, feel free
---
they're so cheap already why
---
Are those all optimized for the C49?
---
Yeah, sorry, I didn't notice you wanted an argument instead of a convo.
---
don't tease me.
---
Be like everyone else and put spy alts in horde and test.
---
I still remember when people were complaining about PLEX rising to 350mill isk...  
---
Try being outformed in pure logi numbers alone (with enemies bringing 50/50 logi/dps).
---
If you were at all interested in a conversation you would’ve read what I wrote.
---
And then you’d realize why I said the “changed policies” view doesn’t hold any water.
---
And why I keep asking you to go back and read it when you say stuff that shows you haven’t yet done so.

I don't think a fight of this size was expected today from either side.  A minor brawl maybe, but who would of thought bad guys would have formed 400 dudes and good guys would have to call for help? 
---
You said you were traveling 9 days, now you say you would only use it 3 days a year. 
---
Used laptops can be very affordable, and if your goal is just to log in to Eve you don't need very much hardware. After your 3-9 days of travel where you "might want or have a need" there are 362-356 days you could also be using the laptop to run eve, as many of us do.
---
It sucks when you miss limited time events, but CCP has a long history of limited log in rewards and time sensitive events. It is up to the individual to decide if the time commitment and rewards out weigh the sacrifice of personal time and family interactions.
---
Still not sure what you are looking to gain out of this thread. You have stated you don't want the presents, and any extension of the login window defeats the intended purpose of the event, I.E., rewarding your dedicated fan base for making time during a busy season. 
---
Or maybe CCP thought a little gesture or gift would help cheer up those players who don't have the "burden" of being with loved ones during the holidays.
---
good luck man! :)

I'm never settled. Too much to do in this game.

---
CCP need to do simple things...IMHO split the fighters into 2 distinct types capitals fights and sub-capital fighters.. none of this anti-fighter fighter nonsense.   Buff the EHP of fighters, debuff the speed and application... if a fighter goes 8km/s I expect it to have the same characteristics of any subcapital that does that speed... it applies to nothing and can not turn.  If you want to apply dps to an interceptor you have the exact same issue as a all subcapital ships do.. bring friends; i.e. rapier, curse, latch, cerbs etc.
---
Support fighters I would switch to not control the grid i.e. TD, damp, ecm and paint.  I know this would go down extremely well with the community at large.
---
PanFam is NC and PH and pets. 
---
Same thing as N3. Which was NC and pets. 
---
I like the name of the trade wars, cool screenshots!
---
Shit isn't meant to be argued with, it's meant to be flushed.
---
It sounds like you just don't know how to navigate around other people. Were all those losses to pvp? Specifically the mach? But yeah general advise is to join a corp. Seems like your not interested in pvp but I really think you should try it out in small gang and fleet action. Wormhole corp maybe. It's usually good money and good friends with lots of random content splashed around.
---
your posting is as horrible as your idea
---
But if the loser try to name the war it make the winner pissed off maybe we would have seen a lot of post/thread on reddit about "muuuh German and Japanese are renaming the waaar they are mean, it's World War II and that's it"

---
Damage cap is fine. You don't want mega blobs clearing entire regions in a matter of hours. Damage caps were introduced for good reason and calls for its removal are shortsightedness.
---
Suppose we want to create a capitals &gt; structures &gt; subcaps &gt; capitals rock/paper/scissors. Right now it's more like capitals &gt; subcaps &gt; structures &gt; capitals. To get what we want, we'd need to buff citadels vs subcaps and nerf capitals vs subcaps.
---
So introduce new buffs for anti subcap fit citadels in sov null space vs. subcaps and fighters. Take moon mining outside citadel gun range. Increase bubble range a little to make room for bubble traps outside citadel gun range.
---
Voila. Now you have to bring capitals to kill citadels in sov null. Fix capitals vs subcaps, and now every entity players can use have an actual balanced use.
---
Isn't SP farming as only activity becoming ISK negative again though?
---
Hence why I said shit posting 
---
You'd be better off putting up a survey and having people put in their net worth and then calculating the avg persons wealth based on the results then trying to ask CEO's to guess at what it is.
---
&lt;3 T1
---
Additionally, delete the NSA, increase sig on SS fighters significantly and maybe buff base carrier scan res slightly to compensate. Now carriers have to make fitting choices.
---
Want to lock fast and have good application? No shield tanks for you, and then lose damage as youre armor tanked.
---
Want a decent tank? Youre sacrificing lock speed or application for it.
---
Then, remove EWAR fighters, or at least siren/dromi (can keep the damp, ECM and TP drones). They should utilize their own mod slots for those functions. They should not be able to do it all without subcap support and make no sacrifices in their tank, application or damage. Hell, carriers now get a hi slot tank (links), hi slot damage mods (FSU) and a hi slot 500% SEBO (NSA). There are no fitting decisions being made, its just fit max tank, damage, application, lock speed and drop a few carriers and you have everything you need for 95% of the subcap fights in the game.
---
Sure sounds it.  All because leadership had the nerve to start cracking down on "ironic" racism and sexism, and it was infringing on his god-given right to drop hard Rs or something.
---
There wasn't a lot of 3840x1080 backgrounds so i screenshotted a few of my own, that's all 
---
Mi fit is an antitackle, i keep it at 30km so i can shoot my missiles and use my warp disruptor.

I scanned him down, and got to disrupt range and well, everything followed its course.

Yeah guess I have to start doing that too. It's so hard to find wallpapers for that monster...
---
ITT: Assmad goons.
---
I don’t mind World War Bee because really it was all about us. The truth was losing that war turned us into what we are today, we needed to be shaken out of the empty husk of a coalition that we once were and turned into the hyper power that we are today. If it wasn’t for WWB I couldn’t see Goonswarm surviving till today.
---
Patch notes in a few months: "Re-added local to resolve bug that caused stations and gates to randomly warp around systems."

And tell all of Killah Bees contacts at CCP that we are going to go to the timer! haha , I THINK NOT !

*Brisc Ruble would like to know your location.*
---
Yeah maybe the math works out for 1 account at 120 USD a year... but with 4 (which is the recommended amount by most non-Zerg alliances. Main, dread/fax, super, titan). Then you’re paying almost $500 a year, which is quite a bit of money to spend on some dying game.

---
&gt;  in tyool 2019 there are very few viable subcap doctrines that can't manage to kite haw titans
---
it's almost like that's because of them in the first place hmmmmmmm
---
Don't gloss over the highsec carebear part. It's an causal part of your dissatisfaction. But take heart, because acknowledging the problem is the first step to fixing it.
---
Here's what I got:  
---
1. You use excessively blingy ships for routine tasks.  
---
2. You believe losing ships is a bad thing.  
---
3. You are quite risk-averse.
---
4. You lack creativity.
---
5. You are heavily focused on accumulating ISK.
---
6. You are worried that you are trapped in an echo chamber.
---
1-5 are all common characteristics of the highsec carebear. The normal life cycle of the carebear is to grind ISK for the sake of having ISK, always with as little risk as possible, yet nonetheless suffer a series of expensive preventable losses, and then quit out of frustration and/or boredom.
---
Does that sound familiar? Is this the the kind of future you look forward to? I don't think so. You need to find a way to break out and discover what EVE is really about. Fortunately, 6 leads me to to be hopeful about your prospects. Yes, you are trapped in an echo chamber.
---
EVE was never meant to be a universe where you could expect to keep your ships forever. Losses are routine. Death is a part of life, since we are immortal capsuleers. Most importantly, our universe was made to enable us to interact with many other players, some as friends and some as enemies.
---
So the first thing you need to do is plan to move out highsec and the disingenuous sense of safety it offers. You need to join a corp or alliance of experienced players who can serve as role models. You need to fly in fleets and talk on comms and explore everything there is to do. You can still go krabbing, but you'll be earning enough to afford your losses, and you'll gain the practical experience to avoid dying stupidly. EVE is immensely satisfying when you free yourself of artificial constraints and overcome your fear of dying.
---
Dank. 
---
When they redesigned capitals they should have spoken to players that liked flying subcapitals.  It was complete madness what they came up with... It was also so obvious what would happen.  
---
Alliances who are terrible at the game... and I mean terrible .. now are mostly off limits to small alliances.  Bastion, TNT, Test etc.  The skill level in these groups has not improved; they are still as terrible as they always were.. in fact the guys that were OK in these groups doing the skirmish stuff; generally quit too.
---
Now CCP are in the situation where any nerf they do get will cause a massive amount of rage and threatening to unsub accounts.   However, if they don't I feel more and more subcapital players are simply going to quit.  You need the little fish in the game as well as the big fish (imho for a healthy game).
---
My Alliance alliance for example was at one stage kinda healthy with activity... Now people just play dota and pubg.  Hydra USTZ is now dead too (healthy EU).. RIP Chessur.

Looks great. WTB ORC capital mining ship.

Actually TiDi worked pretty well for me. It was slow, but everything worked, and no black screens, modules that didn't work at all etc. It was pretty smooth.
---
I jerked off to this
---
Wow, those are great, thanks for sharing
---
Sounds like CODE found someone...
---
Every fight they have had this week?
---
I hope they keep it and actually fix it.  It was done for good reason, to reduce strain on the main servers.  Going back now is basically giving up on the game.
---
I agree with /u/Tevo569 make spy alts.
---
Then drag bubbles from between the beacon and all gates in system. Spread out your smartbomb fleet in each bubble, with the majority of the force on the beacon itself, so they can warp to whichever  bubble they need to get to. Counter to the counter to the counter to the counter...
---
Why don't you start by defining what it means for you to be "good at it"? What does good mean? And what is it?
---
Some people would call 5 losses in a year a stellar record. What is it you hope to achieve, exactly?
---
hehe antifa man bad lol
---
Alternatively... remove dps from citidels... maybe just enough to stop grieving .
---
Mind blown I know.  Want to defend a citidel undock a fleet.
---
Maybe then we would get rid off systems with 20+ structure in there.
---
While I am at it... Keepstar.. 1 per region.. fort one per constellation... astrahus 1 - 2 per system... Offline citidels... no dps or timer; it dies.

There were gambling sites. People bet ISK, the hosts of the sites would get advertising revenue.

The hosts also made loads of ISK and funded things, such as the first max skills character and the Casino Wars.

Is it possible to have launch groups use certain setting profiles when launched in different groups? I. E. Account 1 launches with mining settings when launching the mining group and PvP settings when launching with the PvP group? 
---
Just get Pearl Abyss to monetize it.
---
Charge players $X/mo for local, but let each play pick their own price. You can only see people who paid equal or less $ than you.
---
Almost two years and still havent fun a space family to belong to. Can never find a group that I fit in.
---
it has more to do with booshers creating a weird sort of teleporting grid control meta actually
---
anyway if you get haw titans dropped on you and you don't have a boosher available to whisk your entire fleet to safety immediately in 2019you're actually stupid
---
reason for them to exist: it's a fun way to troll people who are waiting to bridge from your titan
---
Also a yearly sub is $11 a month.  I don't think 500 nuPlex ever gets cheaper than $17.

The absolute worst thing I ever did was fail to buy Plex the Frist time I won eve. I remember when it was 350 and I was astounded thinking it could never get much higher.

Got to ask i see you have been recruited to Theran alliance.
---
So what are they like? active community?
---
I ask because ive been in the rookie chat alot lately and seen how many brand new players these guys have been recruiting. 
---
Ugh tell that to the claymore I bought a couple weeks ago.
---
I wouldn't even say it's because of the "risk" but because of the inevitability of it happening unless you know the area extremely well and is a good fc in the first place (or you just outbob them I guess).
---
The problem is not nerds being risk averse, hell i'd say the adversity to risk is it an all time low given how easy it is to make money individually nowadays, it's just not fun to go out and either turbodunk or get turbodunked, nor does that build skill.
---
I don't know much about them honestly, since I joined 2 days ago. Pretty active, they have activities going on pretty much 24/7.. They have some newbie training programme, which they teach people and stuff and everyone is so nice and willing to help, I even got few donations from them before I lost most of it lol.. Great experience so far, glad I ended up with them.
---
Do you want to end botting? Then CCP needs to utilize anti-cheat software, common in today's gaming industry (Steam, EA, Blizzard) to scan your PC for installed or active programs commonly used by botters, and disallowing you to complete login. I know some of you are under the impression that programs like Near2 and TACO are part of the problem. That's fine, ban those too, I know how to use local and my intel channels. These are a convenience, not a preventative for getting attacked.  
---
Anyways, ban input broadcasting software, botting AI programs, if VPN software can be detected (I don't know, I am not a software engineer/programmer/hacker) then those all should trigger the anti-cheat software and not allow you to log on, period. If VPN can be detected and blocked, then maybe even limiting the number of active accounts from an IP address.

I don't really understand the defense of rorqs based on "but muh response fleets", the rorq nowadays is effectively a structure bash, might as well turn it into a structure already in some sort of pseudo passive mining pos and let nerds fight over that

That's a better way of putting it.

Nah. Artificial hard limits are bad solutions. Imagine nobody else being able to get a keepstar because the largest alliance maintains/defends one in every region.
---
they’d team up and destroy that keepstar, but yeah i get what you re saying, in a world where goons exist it would be unfair
---
what about a siege that lets you end early if you sacrifice SP?
---
This actually depends on where you live and how well set up you are in the game. For me grinding for sub IRL vs grinding for sub ingame is appoximately same amount of time spent (both about 4 hours per account), so yeah, PLEX going up means I'll probably pick some overtime instead of actually being online.
---
&gt; but people aren't going to read a book about game balance
---
those people are the ones who don't care about balance in the first place, trying to appease them will bring nothing but headaches.
---
Had enough for a blops, not enough for ship scanner to put on hunter.

And people still do it wrong every single day.

The meta as someone already explained would be smart bombing BS's at the warp in point.

10 bill cash 30 bil assets. I also have a plex storage for long term investments.

Since you're trying to move part of market from Jita, can't you set these systems to share node with Jita as well?

Giving people motivation to kill them is a much better solution than hard limiting them. A hard limit suggestion will never be taken seriously by neither CCP nor the majority of the player base.

If rorqs can tank 150 bombers and are OP then how did this happen with a cap fleet backing up the OP rorqs? [https://zkillboard.com/related/30004388/201901302000/](https://zkillboard.com/related/30004388/201901302000/)

So you want to fill a rig slot up with a rig that gives you more rig fitting? What single rig takes up so much calibration you can’t fit a second rig?
---
Holy shit this.  Get a job.  Pay for your sub with IRL isk.  Making EVE your job is a fucking terrible idea.
---
Fuck off and take your politics out of the sub.

removing asset safety would be dope, and im pretty sure people would shoot citadels all day

Real Talk: I always thought that the war was named after a pretty good Brad Pitt movie (i.e., War War Z). One in which reemployed the  story of  Goonswarm in the "modern" sense (in eve years). That is, the people came against a threat to their existence and even though they could of simply gave in, they fought through it, and are stronger and more together than ever before.  That's why I always liked the name "World War B"
---
Hell, I'd be kinda honored to be called that name.  Maybe, I'll finally get to fight in the "War for the Last Samurai" so I can leave eve with class and honor, fighting outnumbered and outgunned. Where my avatars punch above their weight along with my friends, despite the fact that we are not going to come out of it (in a one character for one ship kind of way)
---
I enjoy(ed?)  the game when it was much simpler. The constant bitching back and forth kind of ruins it for me. Accept people for where they're at, and have fun that you all play (or played) a game that you can have fun rivalries, and shoot some damn spaceships (or rats or rocks, idk, do you). I just enjoy(ed) playing with people I enjoyed, and could "shooting the shit with"

But I digress.

the citadel caps are bad enough we do not need more cancer caps

Anyway it is far too late now for CCP to even think about limitations. That discussion should have been had when talking about supers / titans being able to dock.

&gt; 2 hours

What
---
I should have clarified. Rorquals are *capable* of tanking that much. It depends heavily on the fit, and how much bling is on the fit.
---
[This guy](https://zkillboard.com/kill/73365009/) tanked 120 cruisers for a solid 20 minutes until he ran out of cap boosters.
---
I played EVE for a few years, but I've been out of it for a few years now too and I'm thinking of returning. I know EVE's "been dying" for a decade now, but what's the actual state of the game now? Do you think it'll still be going in a few years?
---
&gt;There are entire corps that make it their life mission to kill high sec mining bots.

You do realize that CODE. is a trolling roleplay group and not actual bot hunters right?

this remind me when i first play EVE. Low on isk, wandering thru wormhole with my relic scanner T1 frig (with out in-depth knowledge about it only mimicking from youtube video). Blapped by cloacky Protheus and he gave me twice ammount of my ship. "welcome to EVE &amp; fly safe" he said :)
---
I had more luck to newbies. One day I've found week old player belt mining in Venture in lowsec; tackled it, opened convo, typed to not panic, that he'll die soon and if he stays in convo I'll explain what happend and how to avoid that in the future, then after "ok" followed with getting a kill. After about hour long talk, few links thrown and getting him to try exploration instead as something more engaging and profitable.

Like 2-3 months later I've got evemail saying that he created new "main", which he's using for pvp. Last time I checked, he was in one of Provi alliance and quite active on zkill. I don't regret any part of that, even dropping a blops on tutorial-fit mining frigate, and I hope I'll get to shoot him again, this time on more equal footing.
---
Helping new players is great, feeling good that you help is good, but getting a message few months down with them bragging about their progress is just plain amazing.
---
It's been a while since I've seen someone mention Nexus Fleet. I was with them from when they first moved everyone into Stain to near the end. My recollection of why Nexus Fleet fell apart was a shallow leadership pool. When someone inevitably burnout, there weren't enough experience leaders to pick up the slack, and things slowly fell apart from there.
---
just put all the mittani speeches in a text to voice and record it
---
Also worth checking are pyswagger and esipy, which further abstract the API requests for you.
---
They've been working on it since bots showed up after they made the game 16 years ago, and the issue has only gotten worse. Hell, we have progressed to the a point of alpha bots mining in BS's in highsec.
---
Love it. Awesome title, awesome picture. 
---
CCP should just set Perimeter in perma-reinforce for the next couple weeks tbh
---
Ain’t happening, move along. 
---
Why would you link to tvtropes without warning,  you monster.
---
I was 8 articles deep before i managed to escape.
---
Because the bot writers have no motivation currently to account for a delayed local as its a one-off type of even currently. If they intentionally add a local delay bot writers will then take that into account when creating the new software they run.
---
&gt; Nah. Artificial hard limits are bad solutions. Imagine nobody else being able to get a keepstar because the largest alliance maintains/defends one in every region.
---
I would find that great... when goons are able to defend a keepstar in every region.. from the rest of eve.. 24/7.
---
How would reworking asset safety (presumably you want full drops of everything that was in the citadel including access to all line members stuff because your a sicko) how would that motivate people to kill low power spammed citadels with nothing in them?
---
Hauling pays that much on some days.  Granted, that doesen't include the hours of fatigue cooldown.  
---
How about an Implant instead? 
---
Speaking as a Spike my perfect Magic game is a blue control game where I lock you out from doing anything for two hours and when the game is over you quit Magic forever. 
---
I'm with you right up to the VPN stuff. There are people who play this game that can ONLY play via VPN because of internet issues, this would prevent them from playing entirely. But Eve is looooooong over due for adding a functional, effective anti-cheat software. It lets you go after, botters, broadcasters and intel scrapers like taco and near2 all at once.
---
Also T2 relic/data coherence rigs and scan strength rigs.
---
“Some dying game” the day people don’t say eve is dying is the day it truly dies.
---
Pls buy more plex for us grind plebs 1.8b does hurt.  
---
Just fucking delete it. Make the game pretty much the wild west. It would be glorious. 
---
My point was if they made the window wider, it might satisfy/excite/engage more people.  I got a survey, I wanted to tell them that because there was no "what other feedback do you have" box.  I found the window, over the holidays, actually caused the event to bum me out instead of get excited because as soon as I read it, I knew it would be a thing I couldn't finish, as I was not going to buy a laptop/try to get my inlaws to let me install Eve for a booster and some skins.  I assume that was **not** the point of the event. I know many of the CCP devs do read reddit.  So I decided to put this here, because it seems like there are very easy ways to look at altering the event slightly in the future to not *accidentally* make some players get frustrated instead of excited.  
---
Re: 9 v 3 days, I don't WANT to play Eve when I travel to see my family.  I joked about my inlaws, but I actually want to spend vacations with them.  I've also never totted up how many days a year I am completely without a computer, as most of those time I don't care about it.  I am guessing the number of days I want to play a game while traveling is some number between 0 and Days Traveled - 1.  Hence pulling 3 out of my ass, and my thing about the window being a bummer for me.  The window of the event made me think about Eve in a negative light, not a positive one.  Unintended consequence, again.
---
Re: Window length, I think widening the window has no impact on those who don't have other obligations, and does help those who do.  I assume the point was to get people to actually play, not just drive-by log in.  Drive by logs don't add anything to the game.  Getting someone to play does.  So my logic is widening the window excites those who have hard stops in time while still allowing for completion.
---
I care
---
It takes less time at my rl job to get the money for a month sub than it does in game. I realize that's not the case for everyone, but I personally couldn't play Eve if I had to farm plex every month.

---
Accidentally killing a newbro is the worst feeling
---
Eve veterans are very good about using new players for target practice because we want to blow something up, but we don't usually want newbros to quit entirely, so we replace the loss. 
---
30m to a season veteran is almost nothing and we know it's game-changing to a newbro, so we pass 30m along to ensure we get to shoot the newbro again on another day. Or even better, maybe the newbro will one day shoot at us. 
---
Eve is for making spaceships explode!
---
And he's giving up a lot of yield to do it.... but in the end he still died.
---
I’m kind of in the same bot I pay for my subscription but I feel like all I do is mine or try to learn new mechanics which doesn’t really seem that’s even happening and with a baby on the way I have very little free time so when I do play I feel like I’m lost and trying to figure out what I should do and it just wastes time and leaves me frustrated.
---
I would LOVE to talk to SkillU. Can someone from leadership ping me on discord? RonUSMC#5465

Eve has sound? 
---
Lol, thank you carebot.  Your words are a soothing balm.
---
Nah. Then mega blobs would create loot trains region to region. There are always multiple sides to balance issues. Extreme suggestions tend to not consider one or more side. The balance should be just enough to motivate people to kill more citadels (especially unattended ones), but not so strong to lure mega alliances to blob out every citadel to loot them.
---
What needs to happen is something like, upon a process which would require the attacking entity to control the citadel grid for a week (so they need 24/7 control much like wormholes), if the process is successful, then upon death the citadel also drops perhaps %30 of all loot like how ships drop loot. The "process" can be a mobile anchorable structure. So if it's kept alive for the entire week, then the citadel drops loot.
---
I haven't really played in a long while, but are those a fuck ton of Feroxes?

Can we just integrate near2 into eve???

&gt; low power spammed citadels with nothing in them
---
You don't know what's in low power citadels. The average loot is more than enough to motivate people to kill low power stuff in wormholes. You never see unattended low power citadel spam in there, because people kill them for loot.
---
If there is truly nothing in a citadel, then its mere existence shouldn't bother you anyway.
---
aH yes am hiGhSEC man am coolEST NUllsec bAd

Depends on how much hardware they have hanging around for this. If they have say 5 of them, then 1 could just be on Perimeter constantly for the next week or two.
---
indeed... however we also had a hard limit.
---
Nothing preventing goons putting 1000 keepstars in single system if they wanted.

people are acting like pussies... they say omg what gigx did was so bad... he deserves the ban, but if i put 99% of those people in gigx place, after many years of struggle and fighting for what he managed to acquire they ll make worse threats, hell... i d smash the guys head on the desk if i were near him if that happened to me, but people cant face the truth

Ive had lots of experiences like that -- the negative ones always tend to stand out more though. All the new guys i help end up on my watchlist and i check up on them from time to time. A surprising number of them are still active.

---
Yes, there's still enough interest to sustain EVE for the foreseeable future. And if that's not enough, Pearl Abyss were so confident about the game's prospects that they recently bet hundreds of millions of dollars on it.
---
Wormhole trigger sounds are very important!
---
CCP essentially won the lottery with EVE online and created a game that is only fun because it allows relatively unrestricted player interactions. Based on their other games having basically 100% failure rate it surprises me people still defend their competence.  
---
I am 100 percent positive that the issue is on your end. I say this because no one else seems to be having this problem. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that it is a problem with the launcher.
---
I would much rather see a huge reduction in where the diminishing returns on it hit... so it really is a “hop into the game” mechanic, not a “hop into the endgame” one, ie:
---
0-5mil sp = still full value
---
But 5-20mil sp = 400k
---
20-40mil sp = 200k
---
&gt;40mil sp = 100k
---
The numbers are a wild speculation on where the ship breakpoints are admittedly, but I feel like making it a mechanic where a newbro can get on a fleet doctrine, or that first barge or explo ship easy but be restrictively expensive to say have a carrier pilot in a day, might be a median I can live with.
---
Tried on 3 different networks, with a fresh install of the game and launcher. I m not saying you're wrong, but I don't  know what else to do. It will probably run fine in a day or two. That's usually what happens. 
---
I don't use 2FA if I can help it. Will it not spit out the correct code for you?
---
Run a traceroute. Sounds like you aren't communicating with the server.
---
I said [two years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4ryy0q/eve_average_player_count_now_at_2007_levels_is_it/d55cyl6/) that EVE devs were focusing on fan service development: development of more and more features for a smaller and smaller number of EVE's player base.
---
This is just further down that track. For every player with 12 alts, there are 20 players with none -- that's the math that gets you to the 1.5 account per player average which we know is factual from Quant's data. And of course, all the advertising space will be great for placing some ads hoping to get some of those 20 to add some alts...
---
oof
---
Pseudo csm campaign. 
---
Already did, traceroute checks out. 
---
Yeah sorry hunting people praying they're either a broken bot or afk is not really fun. Should be active human error or reflex involved.

This one was hilarious I thought. Dude gets caught in hisec mission, cries then gets ransommed for basically everything then tells the guy he has more shit which the guy promptly demands as well.
---
At the end, sets the guy to red like "This guy robbed me he needs to be taken out"
---
:P
---
What's the EHP of T1 haulers that service NPC mining fleets? I'm wondering how povvo my ship can be and still have a chance at taking them out.
---
And even the ones that don't outright fail during development and actually make it to market, they kill by failing to support them adequately or they just decided to discontinue them due to revenue from the project not being what they thought it would be. There are days I look at their track record and wonder how they ever managed to make Eve in the first place.
---
big groups that can field caps would only have their idiots die but small groups would be annihilated.

You can just extract your main character and continue playing, and just buy SP when you can afford it.

I get the right code on TQ.. but not on SiSi
---
Why would that matter? My connection at home is a lot slower, but reliable. No issues with other games either, aside from updates taking awhile. 
---
You have decent ideas on balance especially null mining and rat scaling, you should run for CSM.
---
I can only speak of individuals in Theran and they are all very positive. If your timezones match then go for it!
---
Also, I don't see how it could be easily pinned as a problem on my end if the launcher with communicate with Sisi but not tranquility. Especially after a clean install. Am I missing something there?
---
I have sat in coms and listened to active non-afk players who get dropped manage to not light a cyno in time or fail to notice the jammer entirely until they try to light long after the anchor timer is over only to find out they can't light it.
---
We used to have a guy called Saveus. Saveus was a military vet with a vendetta against Veldspar and only Veldspar.
---
I have had nothing but issues with trying to update games using hotspots. During my laptop days it got to the point where I would go to the college library at the school I was attending just so I could use a wired connection to update games.
---
So yes you want access to line members stuff. Gonna be a big no from me.
---
Abyssal scram wasn’t a big enough buff?
---
Thank you very much! I'll go look at getting into abyssals,  and look around at the other professions, thank you!

How old is the account you're trying to use on Sisi?
---
I think they released a new version of chat in Eve. Not sure on the specs, but after the change, local chat has been erratic and full of glitches. 
---
CCP made a promise after a bit that If by end of January , if local chat wasn’t stable, they’d roll back to the old platform 
---
Never said they weren't creating content. I just asked if they would take the fight without all of their spies.  Simple question. I have found my answer though. 
---
kekata bomj
---
Wait. Is that image on the right actually real? I thought it was a photoshop that was supposed to be funny..
---
Guess what. I also want average %15-25 of null line member farm to be converted into killmails and content (over PvE ships they use). Currently it's about 4% in ultra safe regions.
---
Line members won't die from losing 20-30 percent of their stuff if they lose their sov structue. They can also evac before losing it. They can choose moving their stuff to lowsec before going long term afk. If not, they can pay the 30% if their stuff gets destroyed. Hell, asset safety already demands 15% of asset value to be activated. Just revert that 15% to the offenders, and this game would see much more content and lots more citadels would die.
---
These people are living in nullsec. Nullsec is supposed to be risky. Not the safest place in New Eden you mega empires currently make it to be.
---
Why not just remove calibration and watch the world burn!
---
My boyfriend joined eve after much nagging from me, he now plays more than I do lol
---
I gave him 100m to start, knowing he had a lot to learn.
---
He immediately blinged out a firetail and proceeded to do the starter missions. Including the one where it destroyed your ship to teach you about loss.
---
I had a little chuckle and gave him another 100m :) 
---
I think itd be cool if instead of giant fleet battles in hisec we just have giant instanced matches on another server so it doesn't disrupt commerce n stuff like mining. 
---
And itd be cool that it wouldn't even have to be space ship fighting if both sides could select battle type it could be like a mortal Kombat tournament or even chess. 
---
Its a idiotic idea. Peoples whole state of mind seems to be "Hmm.. my 100m isk ship can't kill a 8b ship.. nerf pls" 
---
Not to mention, if this were to happen, they would just jump in on a beacon and warp to site. Panic would last long enough.
---
Lol if this is allowed then let's just do IRL casinos for ISK. We can even use the Eve deck.

A meme is a meme. Imagine if a neonazi invented a cure for cancer, that'd be quite the predicament for those who use stuff based on the politics of those who made that stuff.

&gt;Decide to go on a pilgrimage to this "Jita" I keep hearing about, route takes me though a 0.5 region where I warp into to immediately see 3 or 4 ships attacking another vessel. I decided to visit Jita another time. 
---
That's probably Niarja, it's like that all the time. The gankers mostly target freighters or other expensive-but-defenseless targets.
---
I've never heard of the casino joke as anything as a big joke. vOv
---
I suppose you got ganked out of boredom.
---
If you're traveling in something that isn't easy to gank, or worth it, like a venture, you're fine - especially in highsec. Just don't use autopilot. Take the gates manually.
---
Don't be afraid of blowing up. It's worth it in the end. You either learn something or get some ISK.
---
The worst thing you can do is not play the game out of fear of blowing up. Makes for a very boring sandbox
---
Would just like to point out. Rorqual's are not the tankiest ship in the game. This might come as a shocker, but they are capital ships and have a capital sized tank \*Gasp\*. Which btw, was nerfed with the limiting of the Dual ASB Rorq. (Rip). 5 idiots in bombers should NOT be able to bring down a capital. When you fly one, you'll agree with us too.
---
What a time to be alive.   Plex, drink, welp, repeat. 
---
I love playing cards, i also love getting isk out of my buddies betting on stupud shit.
---
The alliance tournament really needs EVE bet again.  It was such a bigger event when that was around
---
I’m 6 years in with &lt; 1b wallet, and 150b assets. Slow accumulation since I started. I don’t actively try to make isk anymore, I just live off what I have and station trading.

---
&gt; expensive-but-defenseless

That's not really the qualification. Can it be destroyed using ships worth less than half of what it can drop?
---
Autopilot a cruiser with 2 bill worth of fits and see if it survives. 
---
but it's so damn convenient
---
I've flown my fair share of capital ships. Rorquals have tank rivaled only by FAXes.
---
I'm not saying 5 people in bombers should kill one. But one *mining* ship should not be able to shrug off a 75 man battlecruiser fleet. And that same ship should *definitely* not have a 7 minute invulnerability button.

I dunno what the ehp is but you can do it super easy in a polarized Hecate and those have 600dps, so just align out and blast. When the rats land you took too long and should probably warp.

Try heading through some lowsec areas. I still try to solo PvP (albeit just like most people I do have a cloaky scout generally with me to scan / keep my stuff safe). Sometimes I'll just jump through lowsec sitting on gates in battle ships / hacs /hics by myself hoping for a fight and get nothing so I just go back and dock up. Then I just take a t1 frig / destroyer / faction frig out to hit plexes for fights in FW space and I actually get content.

The issues I mainly see with "leading Spikes" is that they do not expect, but DEMAND everyone else to play like a Spike, too.

Sounds like an idea that might work best in NPC null and even then after some really hard establishing work. Sov null would require some very good connections to people.

I should clarify.  The tool was not related to Eve, it was a data visualization tool used for analysing a variety of data types.  It was written in java.

My comment intended to express the value of letting a user organize their interface arbitrarily. One of my workstations had 8 monitors and I could place interface boxes on them as I wanted to without having them locked within a root window.

Imagine having a 19 inch monitor dedicated for the chat interface, another for the fleet window and inventory etc.

That is actually not a bad idea, and scale the costs upwards with number of clients per single machine or single IP group / range. Like really upwards, multiply it x5 or x10 per each. 
---
This would be good for everyone. CCP would get money, PA would get money, legit players would have a very low cost chat, only ones affected would be bots / multiboxers.

No more than 3-5bil liquid ISK

My crowning achievement as a Timmy is turning the tables on a Spike player at a local tournament. I'd won game 1. He managed to lock me with no permanents on board but after I'd combo'd off to 1 trillion life total on turn 3. We then proceeded to play 200 turns of magic until the judge called time. I knew I couldn't win but I also knew that I couldn't lose. He didn't have the few hundred hours to kill me with combat damage because it was a sanctioned tourney. I offered him the draw but he didn't accept so I took the 1-0-1 win.   
---
Said spike player stopped coming to the store I played at after that tourney.

True or not, idgaf... You need to pull the stick out of your ass and lighten the fuck up. It's a fucking meme.
---
TankGu/RailGu/Stratios the only considerations for this IMHO. 
---
Didn't CCP say somewhere that they are going to put an end to SP farms ? Did they never get around to it ? Or did they change their minds ? What happened to that ?
---
And yes, mobile depot with an integrated analyzer like the frost one is great if you have the PG/CPU. 
---
Cloaky nullified is great while traveling
---
I feel like it took a Johnny to start the booshing bomber fleets in this game.
---
So some shit will quit and GTFO as it should have never been in the 1st place. So that is a negative thing how ?
---
I love that this has become a profession
---
Y'all don't have to be in groups which are prone to be in TIDI situations.

Ferox market looks like it's going to be nice soon.

The enemy of my enemy is a guy I always enjoying punching in the face.
---
Asteroid &lt; Stratios &lt; T3C
---
That's the spod rot.
---
I heard it was all because of the high ranking goons fucked one of the bankers wife at one of the meetups and it just spilled into the game. 
---
Yeah these guys came out of no where It feels like. We kill a bunch of them in Fruleger, it's hard to tell which ones are new to the game and /or are returning to it.
---
Now what if I told you for only 3.50 I could make that goose sink... But if they are a witch-goose, they will still float...
---
What's that that? Oh, The method, yeah; we're just gunna tie a bunch of rocks around your goose until it dies. Really we just don't want that shit in our village fuck off with your witchgoose bullshit. No one can read eggs. 
---
Too many Rorq pilots injecting more Rorq pilots
---
If they remove local I’ll be back in a fucking heart beat hunting botters. 
---
Local is in a good place right now.
---
Pick up mobile cyno inhibitors for the duration of the event. Will at least give you guys a chance to get out.
---
We should start betting with eve-famous corpses.
---
Injectors were here before the korean overloads arrived, and its not pay to win, pay to fly things faster maybe, but it doesn't give people the brains to fly what they buy.
---
&gt;Actual human playerbase has been steadily declining for quite some time
---
Zero proof best proof..
---
They've had almost a year.  A....year....Apparently they don't know how to work with AWS.
---
I don't think you can apply these categorizations to Eve as well as you want to.
---
I'm very competitive when it comes to video games in general, but I cannot identify with the "Spike" archetype you describe. My primary goal when playing is to become better at the game. It's what makes online games fun to me, I usually have less fun when I'm not trying to be optimal in whatever game I'm playing.
---
I've never enjoyed "rudimentary tactics". If you said "proven" tactics or something, I would agree. I would never use a fit that hasn't been either extensively theorycrafted, tested on sisi or proven to work by another group. In fact, you have to be in a somewhat competitive group to pull off more complex fleet concepts. However, if there is a simple way and a hard way to achieve the same outcome, I will always choose the simple way.
---
Also I've never cared about expensive lossmails. For myself, I hate all my losses equally. It doesn't matter if the ship is 15m or 1.5b. The thing that matters is *how* I lost it. If it's because I actively fucked up in a fight, I'm gonna be mad at myself and try to never make that mistake again. If it died because of an FC decision or because of a genuinely unwinnable situation, I shrug it off. And when someone else loses an expensive ship I roll my eyes and don't say anything, because I think what other people do with their spaceships is their own business.
---
Also I have never enjoyed "blobbing". I would not enjoy staying in a group like you described, pinging more dudes after already outnumbering the other side 2:1. I know lots of people thing it's silly, but I want to win by having better tactics, better piloting and better fits than the opponent. Not by having more dudes. 
---
So what class of player does that make me?
---
My focus on winning and constantly improving would make me a "spike", but at the same time the most fun I've had was in a wormhole brawl with a blinged out armor T3 fleet with tons of varied roles including a dread. 
---
That would either make me a "Timmy", because everything is blinged out and optimized or a "Johnny", because of the complexity of having DPS Legions, neut legions, guardians, bhaalgorns, web lokis, a web vindicator, booshers, links and a dread all working together in the same fleet.
---
But then again, that fleet composition wasn't chosen for the sake of complexity, but because every part of that fleet had an important role that had to be filled to get the optimal value out of our numbers.
---
?
---
P2W hasn't actually arrived in Eve yet. Injectors don't make you a better pilot, or make the ships you buy better they just let you fly more ships. Idiots using injectors to fly ships they don't understand is a prime source of fantastic killmails. P2W means you can buy something with money that is better than anything I can buy with in game currency and that is not the case with Eve.
---
You can catch real people who are warping between sites too. You warp, you instantly align to a safe. Everyone does that.

All I know is this thread title was the best part of it.
---
4 accounts with 6 useful characters, 3 are hulk pilots 1 is a hauler, 3 can PVP, 1 has trade skills, they all have planetary interaction skills, between them I can fly anything except titans
---
I just got back. Eve bet is dead? What about that site that let you game let with the spots to win ships/isk.
---
&gt;I decided to visit Jita another time.
---
I LOL'ed.
---
Today they were targeting incursion ships.
---
ITT I realize I am quite poor.
---
As far as i can tell they are FRT renters.
---
They must be spam recruiting everyone in High sec. Most of the guys isee from them are under a week old
---
What you can't spam Reddit like Evemail?
---
buying the ability to fly a ship doesn't make it any better than my ship. I'll happily fight a newbro who wallet warriored their way into a shiny ship because I'm relatively sure they have no clue how to fly what they just bought, and I've been flying mine for years.
---
So... You want in?

Seems like you already had one.

You do realise stone toss is a literal neo-Nazi right?
---
The thing you want to look into next is called a “clone bay”.  Instantly change clones whenever you want.  No need to risk those +5s
---
Nah. Killing newbros is good. Just srp their ship and convo them. Make sure the srp is worth more than their ship.
---

I think a better title would have been “Black Rise Matters”, but to each their own.  
---
Eve has a pretty astounding GG/GF culture you don't see in many online games.
---
I feel kinda dumb now tbh. completly forgot about that lmao
---
all you gotta do is awox a napoc with an imp geddon apparently 
---
They have multiple servers.  When a big fight is going to happen, the FCs are supposed to notify CCP so that the target system(s) get moved to their own server.   Even then some fights get so big there’s just not much else you can do.    
---
   
---
Which leaves you with a couple options: join in; temporarily move to a different region; or duck and cover until the storm passes.   
---
  
---
As for the rest of what you are talking about - think it through a little more.  We play this because we like spaceships.  If I wanted to play chess, I’d go to chess.com. 
---
I remember these words.
---
ok
---
That like calling the CFC "Redswarm Federation" because both had Goons in them.
---
The summer war, with everyone vs everyone  (PanFam + Frat vs Legacy in the southeast and Goons vs GotG + PanFam in the Northwest) 
---
CFC doesn't exist anymore. 
---
So calling past things also past things is whichever fantasy you like. 
---
How much isk can you make doing FW, and is it fun?
---
I’m still mostly living off of EVE Bet winnings. It was the best isk/h in the game.
---
That was a long time ago, doesn’t really qualify as “recent”. 
---
its really good
---
Check the market because that's not true anymore for a while.
---
Considering the cost for extractors and multi character training each character will give you less than 200M isk a month doing sp farming.
---
I was under the impression he's a libertarian

 Take your blob and go back to nullsec ty
---
I remember 2 years ago when my first nullsec adventure started, that Circle of Two pilots would routinely come to hellcamp my vexor with carriers and big fleets and say I'm retarded for not understanding nullsec politics, I ended up not playing EVE because of that, I guess the saying is true, "He who laughs last, laughs hardest"

Where is Co2 grave so I can dance on it?

That's awesome. Probably my best moment was in a draft where I beat a guy who natural cast [[Emrakul, The Aeons Torn]] and swung at me twice with her. Still can't believe I pulled that off.

&gt; Like most classifications, this triumvirate of archetypes is an oversimplification. All of us care about facets embodied in these archetypes to some degree.

Allright, what's the difference between the CFC and the Imperium?

If the name-change happend in or after the fallout of WWB I would have respected it, because it went trough some major changes during that time. But that's not what happend.

It is the war we always have.

It had nothing to do with oversight, it has to do with nations/states gambling regulations with regards to video games.

I’ve posted this before but I stand by it. CCO should delete local and encourage bots. Bots are just a better form of rat. It would be very fun to hunt them down.

What you do is just set up a second slot as a farm in jita.

Using AWS is also pretty weird.  They already have server farms and data centers.  Why would you outsource that?

AWS is good for rapid scalability, but it's expensive.  And why do they need scalability for just chat?

I don't get it.

Ganked in .9 space and taken to structure? What were you flying?

redirect hko village to local
---
To be honest: I hope not. Eve is has never been a game with fun and challenging PVE, it has never been, there is no foundation to build on. We would get some patchwork, nothing else. CCP doesn't have the ressources to build a completely new game with regular big expansions. But exactly that would be necessary if you want a PvE experience, which can compete with the themepark MMOs. Instead they should use the limited resources they have to improve the foundation they already have - a PvP and risk management oriented sandbox game.
---
Botting in Eve is a problem like crime in the real world. It can not be eradicated. But the police/ the security team can constantly fight against it and keep it at levels, which most people can live with. It's a neverending task, and you'll never satisfy everyone. Thanks to those who attempt it anyways.

Yes anti man bad, fuck every kind of extremist, especially those using violence

because its not about speed, its about quality
---
On a more serious note, CCP has demonstrated an opportunity for more engaging PvE gameplay with the release of Abyssal Filaments and Frigate trios. It’s on them to implement such gameplay in all regions of space, rather than accepting the complacency of the player base to keep farming the status quo into stagnation. 
---
launcher have never given me any problems, sounds like you need to fix your shit
---
&gt;And no, I didn't submit a ticket. The wait time is atrocious, and the last few times I did, for similar issues, the support folks couldn't tell me what was wrong or how to fix it. It's always { timeslice} this or "failed to connect" to that.
---
Of course they can't explain when its your fault.

yea i love the boosh raven too but why is piggles trying to remove the GTFO launcher anyways

is he mad about that chain GTFO from hakonen(which was fucking hilarious btw) still?

aha i found u pgl alt
---
I have to kill every frig that come through though, they could be alt scouts.
---
If they chat back and have a story I give them 10m-25m + SRP. I've even checked up on one dude a week later, he had joined a WH corp \o/.
---
"Trying" changes - spitballing them and seeing if they would stick - has gotten Eve into far more lingering trouble in the past than anything else. Zeroing in on Titans only and ignoring the rest of the capital ecosystem is just dumb and such myopic obsessing will - not might - will throw yet more things out of balance. We've seen this same script being acted out with different things time and time again.
---
As for the GTFO specifically, I think you'll strain to use two hands worth of fingers to account for all GTFO uses in major, serious combat since its introduction with the Citadel release. How this even entered PGL's calculus is beyond not just me but apparently the remainder of non-TEST eve as well.
---
You sound like a perfect eve player. Welcome.
---
As much as it's easy to join the hate train for Progod, at least he's trying and getting more of a dialogue going on the subject, hopefully next on things that might need looking at are boosh chaining fleets 
---
Oy vey, only on reddit will you find people who think beating up neonazis is a bad thing. Nazis give up their right to not get beaten up in the streets when they subscribe to an ideology that preaches hate and violence against innocent people.

---
Doing FW can be quite profitable, if you have the alts to farm multiple plexes or you blitz missions. Look up L4 FW mission blitzing. 
---
so your justification for capitals being ok, is that you need a booshing fleets with 200km+ lock range to pve a structure, where capitals can t touch them? doesn t sound like there is any intereaction between the players, in a scenario where pvp should be the main thing. If disputes for structures are now decided by fleets where one can not touch the other - EVE is dead.
---
I don t care much about rorquals but it s probably the most regular killed capital ship out there, it s basecly made to be tackled. And I don t see the benefits of making it easier for 100 dudes in bombers or 24 in Drekavaks / Leshaks to kill a single dude who just wants to make some isk.  My guess is they are there to generate content. The problem comes back to the issue of the capital umbrella being way to strong against subcapitals and Cyno s making travel to a combat grid way to easy. 
---
I consider the scenario where someone jumps in a HAW dread to fight 50 dudes in subcapitals alot more interesting and fun for both sides, but unfortunately the dread can volley subcaps so fast off the field that you re basecly forced to jump in other capital ships to kill the dude and the whole fight is over in a minute... I really think the game could change for the better and be alot more fun for many pilots, if capitals were tuned down. noone wants to fight something that kills you in 2 volleys giving you hardly the chance to react.
---
preach
---
one time they said cap fatigue would make life more dangerous and we all said that it would do the opposite because enemy caps cant get to you now which in turn will make cap umbrellas more safe and we were told that wouldnt happen l m a o 
---
I'm okay with PVE remaining an easy, relaxing activity. I'm NOT okay with PVE being an activity you can do while afk (VNI ratting, for example).
---
I would emphasize the economic problems due to Injectors/Rorquals a bit more but other then that you are spot on. 
---
Some times its easier to lobby the goverment then adapt to the market.
---
I thought the EVE Onion was a site with parody and satire articles...
---
Is this stuff legit? I know the tweets are real.
---
rorquals are fine.
---
remove excavators - they are the issue.
---
They fixed various bugs that allowed people to train SP for free, aka "ghost training".
---
But SP farming as a whole -- using a subbed account for nothing but training and extracting brain goo -- was never a thing they wanted to put an end to. Free markets, arbitrage between plex and injectors, that's just normal eve stuff. (Plus they make more money from a farming account than from a normal one, because the farmer buys both plex and extractors. Also farming keeps the value of MCT certs high, which is another thing they can sell.)
---
Or maybe start with removing PANIC from Rorquals.
---
i put alts into theran then rf their jump bridge and awox blues with this fortizars for hours upon end until someone realises and boots me out, only for me to do the same thing the next morning on a new alt.
---
They're complete trash and really arent a good place for newbros to be going.
---
drones are already easy to kill
---
Well lets see if my response doesn't get downvoted to oblivion
---
I will agree with you that I approached the capital balance the wrong way.  I said those things because I think they limit doctrine choice, which limits content options.  While I especially agree that Rorquals should have their local tanks nerfed, and generally agree with most of your points, I didn't mention them because I felt they've been said before, and I wanted to talk about things that don't get talked about often.  Clearly that wasn't a great idea.
---
That being said, your second paragraph is ridiculous, and you're just making shit up.  I've used boosh fleets before, we even had it as a doctrine, we got rid of boosh rokhs about the same time you did and turned it into a cache doctrine because it's situational at best.  
---
However, I also know how to counter boosh fleets, which clearly you do not, as I watched that fight.  It is not difficult to disable a boosh raven fleet, especially in the time alotted, you should have been better prepared.  You didn't lose the Keepstar because it's invincible, you lost the Keepstar because you half assed dropped a Keepstar while most your FC team was still coming back from semi-AFK and you didn't anticipate what they would do.  You have to bring a specialized subcap fleet to counter them, you didn't do it, you lost a keepstar, it happens.  I fucked up a dread drop, I lost some dreads, it happens.  Don't pretend like just because you lose a fight that the meta has all the sudden been discovered, you're not that infallible.
---
Boosh fleets are good, especially the ravens (which you guys countered like two years ago with the rokhs anyway), they have a niche, but they're not invincible, and a well prepared enemy will counter them easy enough.  You guys were fielding boosh rokhs for most of 2018 and then stopped.  Why?  Did they suddenly become not good?
---
And I had no problem countering your capital drops with subcaps on 3 separate occasions in December when you tried to knock out our fortizars in Oijanen.  Each time we used subcaps to pin your cap fleets and kill 60 billion isk worth of Fax.  As much as they may surprise you, I'm not actually trying to increase all of my own play styles, I'd like to see some of the other FCs get some turns and I have my reasons 
---
heh, i remember it being used like twice in fights i have been in
---
because I want to field fleets with less than 100km range again.  Basically I want zealots back.  Sue me.
---
You're using your own keepstar fuck up to prove a point?  Yea very scathing indeed.
---
Dear CCP. Why oh why can you not utilize virtualization and memory balooning to automatically migrate high-load nodes over to more heavy hardware instantly? Surely we'd be OK with a bit of hang while the VM hosting the instance is migrated. Just send out a server message so everyone knows it's moving the same way as you do when there's a server restart.
---
I know, it'd probably be hard to implement perfectly and I have no insight into which resources are really drained in big fights (I'm guessing CPU, memory and IOPS), but god damn how nice it'd be to always be in reinforced mode when the party goes through the roof.
---
If anyone can do it, it'd be you right? Right...?
---
Useless. Should go back to calmil FW.
---
Please clap
---
While you are right that the boosh ravens are strong, you forgot to mention two very important facts here:
---
A) They only work offensivly, for defense they are garbage. You will not break enough faxes before LR titans reffed the objective. 
---
B) They can be countered e.g.  by chemos, yes you might feed a bunch of T3Cs but taking out the CDs will render them very vulnerable. 
---
*stands up even more behind my height adjustable desk* Debate me, you are wrong. 
---
I've been toying with this idea for a while as well, would people recommend a Tengu or a Loki?   Can fly both pretty well, and have good missile skills and projectile skills, and I think I have decent or good rail skills too.   I was thinking of day-tripping in C2/C3s and don't mind semi-blinging a ship, or pimping a Statios if that is the ticket.  
---
I think it'd be cool if instead of a giant market we just ejected everything we own into space and biomass
---
1 HAW Dread vs 50 Dudes even in Cruiser won't do anything assuming you have at least 5 Logis and even without 5 Logis, you can always warp out against 1 HAW because no hard tackle.
---
1 HAW Rev has like 2800 DPS at 34km optimal and that's roughly 4-5x mainline BS. 
---
Long story short 1 HAW Dread vs 50 Cruiser = 1 dead HAW Dread.
---
yeah just be more like init! - korean parent #1
---
zealots are fast just move out of the GTFO range lmao
---
I don't remember that at all.
---
I remember that it was pushed as a way that smaller cap fights can happen without cap fleets from all across the universe converging.
---
Which is true.
---
the drones aren't the issue, the instant "i'm invincible lol" button is when combined with the huge retarded fuck off tank of rorqs, *combat* drones being monsters on rorqs, etc.
---
Amen on that!
---
i mean i dont care getting stomped on spearfishing in delve with some crap; and agree on the rorqpart for sure. A Solution is to dont make a rorq able to run both at same time.... and or make it open the same efffect like the mobile cyno inhib with it to force a bit better resonce like running cyno activate the paladin effect and get dunked by 80 supers :) 
---
you still can have multiple cynos in system to get your force in but also be able to distract em. This even pushes the minigstuff at a lot more risc and reduce the inflation we courently have... at least a bit.
---
Watcha gona do about it, let some dinobrains upvote another "balance" thread on reddit?
---
Wasn't the cultural revolution a goon thing? Why then did he care since your post makes it sound like he was against goons
---
Remove PANIC, suddenly Rorquals can be dread bombed. SOUNDS LIKE CONTENT TO ME.
---
I am confused. You do not see the benefit of making a Industrial Capital ship easier to kill by 25 other players who are flying the highest dps subcaps in the game? 
---
Elaborate ruse to get test to fly ravens 
---
heh
---
fuck rorqs tbqh i'm still going to be poor but at least i won't deal with rorqual cancer
---
Managed to pop one in a Catalyst running ~550dps. Yay me
---
Iirc, your ship will try to emergency-warp, and will be removed from space after 1 min. That is, if you don't have any timers, and dont get any in that minute
---
Botter detected :) 
---
the point here is active playstyle. there is no problem for a single guy to mine a bit and make even a lot of isk with it.... but you know there are dudes running like 20 rorqs at once and you are basicly kind a chanceless to get on him.
---
This pushes the market crazy as fuck which in the end fucks the poor lone dude again who trys to make some isk in a normal way.
---
Aha, a goofus bot-aspirant! A Code-compliant player would have docked up.
---
yeah fatigue was a good change.  The sad truth is that Phoebe probably was going to save dominion if we hadn't already all jumped aboard the "occupancy sov" manifesto that TMC pushed.  It was already sort of working.
---
aside from pissing off fleets waiting for a titan bridge, only time i remember GTFOs ever being used was that time that PGL nightmare fleet got chain GTFO'd in hakonen
---
a classic
---
60 seconds, or upon warping out and landing in a safespot 1m km away
---
is this just a long winded post you jerking yourself off?
---
Man, he's got you here. 
---
Like, fully. 
---
no?
---
No, but I do want to have your rorqual if you don't mind
---
When doesn't he!? smh
---
Trade war is a great name
---
&gt; However, I also know how to counter boosh fleets, which clearly you do not, as I watched that fight.
---
&gt; Of all capital balance problems GTFOs are top of the list?
---
during C-L i GTFO'd progod (in a munnin fleet i think) in 99.9999% tidi, or at least i tried. i don't remember how many i got.
---
not really, when the rorq is basicly garanteed to be tackled and can hardly fight back. It s a very one sided fight, where one guy is just beeing clubbed down and has no chance to punish his attackers.
---
Delete local? Yes please 
---
Tolerate bots? Fuck no, there are enough soulless VNI pilots around without robots taking their jobs
---
Its not worth the standing loss imo.
---
Most rewarding for new players is exploration and salvaging if you look for isk/h.
---
I'll het right on that. Thanks for the help
---
Adapt to invulnerability xd
---
It will always be The Casino War for me. 
---
To show just how deep I am in to the glass of koolaid I will state that The Imperium even had the better outcome from it all, particularly if you look at where they, The Imperium, are now versus where those still actually present in the game that relied on the casino cash are.
---
but it's true.
---
It isn't real, alas.
---
Some people learn from mistakes and analyze what went wrong instead of crying about it and begging the dev's to change the game to suit them? Damn, that's crazy, huh?
---
We really do live in a society
---
what does it matter if the rorqual dies or not if it loses 4 or 5b in drones?
---
I disagree. PvE is boring, that's a fact we accept. Why enforce an Asia style grind then, where you have to do the same sequence of "click here, wait a few seconds, press that key, watch for event XY and move your mouse over there if it happens" over and over again?
---
The AFK VNI fits very nicely in the "manage risk/reward" Eve environment. Reward is relatively low, but getting it is very convinient, you don't have to be bored. The ship you put at risk is neither expensive not extremely cheap, the risk of actually losing it is very high. But this risk can be lowered A LOT by cooperation with other players (massively multiplayer!). I think that's a great design - for this game and probably for this game only. In most other environments such a thing would be terrible.
---
Rorqual…
---
Farms 150-200m isk/h
---
Has 800dps drones which go 6k m/s
---
Has 40k+ dps local tank and 7min invul on top of that
---
Has self links
---
Has remote reps, that each rep as much as a scimi out to 180km
---
but naaah.. theyre fine...
---
I agree that logi would be an issue if a haw dread cannot volley people as fast as it does atm. If damage or aplication was towned down maybe a Module could help out here, a capital point that makes it slower to target or decreases logi effects(not stackable) I just think that a scenario where it s more of a grinding down then destroying ships in 3 secs would make dreads more engageable then they are atm and make them better content creators of epic battles. And that s what capitals should be, Epic battles. Not just bubble, cloak, light cyno drop the hammer and have a lopsided fight that lasts 40 sec s.
---
Then hit fringe, good for a titans worth of ore 
---
we would but we already have boosh rokhs.  Except we don't according to Mukk (we do though).
---
just a little point right now its fairly easy to kill drones using cloaky camping and bombing.  those drones are worth more than the rorqual.  now if killing a rorqual was only 3b instead of 8b with the drones?  mmm, ya, no invincibility sounds fine.
---
Trust me! I am a doctor.
---
why stop at the drones, just kill the rorq too
---
It takes a village, and it seems PGL took the job of village idiot :thinking:
---
No like, I've actually done it.  Defending your space last year actually.
---
no1 cares about drone kills.. i dont want drone kills, i want interesting fights.
---
but if the guy sitting in a rorq doesnt have any problems tanking or fighting off the guys tackling him, fights dont happen.
---
completely ignoring that 90% of the time a cyno goes up and tons of caps jump in...
---
You must first complete any active warps. I got a fritter caught a few weeks ago in niarja. I had no combat timer when I logged, but I was getting bumped. I died over 15min later. Petitioned but gms explained that I was trying to warp when logged, and that needs to complete prior to timer starting.
---
#sadface
---
You make a really strong argument. In fact I basically agree with you. I just think that this low barrier to entry is making botting worse. If we changed anom mechanics to be more complex the bot software would adapt, but surely the more complex it becomes the easier it is to detect. 
---
Man I hadn't made the connection but that was always one of the best pastas this game ever gave us. D'you have any more of this stuff?
---
AFK ratting, AFK mining, AFK anything is not actually playing the game. It is exploiting an outdated system of software mechanics that has not been updated enough to keep up. Multiboxing is multiplying that exploitation x whatever the number of AFK accounts is being ran.
---
When you either observe or actually actively play PvE it is significantly different in behavior and overall effect on the game, especially the economy.
---
It is very easy to tell a difference between an active player and a bot, whereas it is very difficult to tel la difference between an AFKer and a bot. AFKers are botlike, double or triple this if they are doing whatever AFK thing it is on multiple accounts.
---
Therefore, no loss. When an AFKer account or multiboxer account that behaves and has same or similar effects on game and its economy get banned, then fuck it. It is good riddance. the game is way better off retaining some newbs then entire armies of these botlike AFK accounts. 
---
FFS the botlike multiboxers and AFKers can't even be called players, since they don't actually play. So if they quit and GTFO or get banned or whatever, it is not a loss of a player.
---
Loki &gt; Legion &gt;&gt; Tengu &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Proteus
---
Ok, so you say that capitals in the umbrella are OP, but then you point out that subcaps won the objective even with defending caps on field. Which is it?
---
As to point 2, completely irrelevant, that has been how cynos have always worked. In fact, subcaps can do the exact same thing with a bridging Titan.
---
Most of your other points were equally laughable. Please come back and post AFTER you understand capital mechanics and the overall meta.
---
I don t even have one rorq and can t stand vni ratting because it s so boring. I like solo pvp in fw and small gang fights where people shoot each other and the odds are kinda balanced. I dislike killing procurers or covetors because it s just one person bashing someone else pretty risk free. Same applies to rorqs it just needs more dudes.
---
I have absolutely nothing against nerfing the mining yield of a Rorq and making them push buttons on a regular basis, if it helps the economy. I am absolutely for it if it increases prices for capitals again, because dreads and carriers are way to cheap for their effectiveness and the insurance is to good.
---
 I can t offer you a solution to a guy with 20 rorqs but I guess making them push more buttons could help. 
---
And what exactly is wrong with doing that to prove a point over yours? 
---
If you haven’t jerked yourself off before, I very much recommend it. Few other things in life are so self-gratifying 
---
&gt; I said those things because I think they limit doctrine choice, which limits content options.
---
I disagree.
---
as a line member the LAST thing I want to do is have 90 different doctrine ships in every staging structure. let alone the cost/time of training to actually fly them all.
---
know what limits content more than having only a handful of viable ships? only having a handful of viable pilots because you're all training different rando shit because you've got a million doctrine requirements. that shit'd piss me off as some one with literally all Vs in every subcap skill in the spaceship command section of the skill tree. as a new player who'd have to waste hours of time training and/or farming for injectors - i'd just quit and go and find a game that wasn't so obtuse.
---
"more options" means sinking a lot more isk in to ships i'll rarely fly - which i simply wouldn't do, which means i'd just go on less fleets. That's not good for content. Newer players would be in the same boat not because it'd be frustrating logistically, but because they just don't have the deep pockets or breadth of SP us veterans do.
---
Removing PANIC would mean Rorqs losing their main tank mechanic. Which would force CCP to improve the rest of the Rorq tank. Which would cause them to be super tanky cap ships, something we don't need. A more interesting option would be making panic unusable during cyno and vice versa. 
---
You PANIC? Cool, you got an invul period, but the other guy can drop a cyno inhib, so your backup has to fly there. Or you need an exterior cyno, that CAN be killed while you're invul.
---
 You cyno? Cool, you probably have reinforcements coming, but you're taking damage and might die within the cyno timer.
---
Right now, Rorqs can be invul AND have reinforcements on the way. Last time I checked, EVE wasn't supposed to allow players to have their cake and eat it too.
---
I meant currently solo, cuz i cant find or dont want to find a good place and give up freedom
---
Well this is a new argument.  Why not just remove the other ships then?  Save everyone the hassle.
---
If you could actually make a point without getting your space balls in and being political in a neutral topic, it'd be really nice. 
---
Oof the flair bait.
---
gosh you mean like you shouldn't be able to tank 1v100 long enough for you to get 99 caps in and make it """fair"""?
---
Cause the point is stupid.  They didn't lose the keepstar because boosh ravens are unbeatable.  They lost because they fucked up and forgot to bring a booshfleet counter that actually works.
---
This is all your fault and you should feel bad about it.
---
Just wondering what these glitches are. I'm returning from a 3 year hiatus and I never really dived that deep before so I'm not sure what everyone is talking about with errors in local chat.
---
Sorry for the n00b question.
---
I agree on your thing with the problem for small skirmish stuff... i once play a long time in low sec and feel with you that you since then in 2007 mostly get stomped on. 
---
It is hard getting cool fight's since then :( 
---
The sad truth is that ccp want all pve to be in abysmal deadspace, so they are hunting bots with that in mind. I see this being a grander plan to rework pve in a more effective way of getting our cash.
---
There is a time and place and in our face on reddit is neither :P
---
Isn't the booshball-raven vs structures under capital protection a thing because of shitty citadel hitboxes? And isn't that also a doctrine that isn't really counterable if you don't dedicate a good portion of your own forces to doing it? 
---
The problem with EVE's combat is that it doesn't require as much skill as other games do. At least not in the "fight" part of it. So where one can usually balance ease-of-use against power, EVE can only balance power against power. This problem is only exacerbated by TiDi. 
---
This is precisely why the booshing ravens did what they did. Try countering an enemy that just randomly appears on the battlefield, can hit you from outside your range and then do it all again at even the slightest hint of trouble. Now do it in TiDi. Now do it in bad TiDi where your modules just don't work half the time. Sure it's *possible*, but is it *feasible*?  
---
how about using a AB fit and burn around while tank ?
---
Interesting. The other thing I'd as profoundly missing from the discussion is the impact of injectors towards capital proliferation.  Myself, I don't consider people human unless they have a fax alt.
---
Should you tell him or should I?
---
Nothing about my post was political.  He pointed to past fights, I pointed to past fights.
---
The guy had RL emergency and just walked (ran) away from PC with Rorq and drones on field. 
---
It's a sad loss but what would be sadder is if he ignored a RL emergency b/c pixels
---
100% test is too retarded to use them
---
You know, the booshball tactic is high on the nerf list of CCP. Consider this as a method of the past.
---
i don't. progod is full of shit.
---
Cause then you get gtfoed....
---
What is the difference between a rat and a VNI bot? It would push the bit creators to make them better. I think it would add very interesting gameplay. Have you seen the open ai in dota? They’re unbeatable. What about Starcraft? 
---
from my experience it depends where you live. I made very bad experiences in Highsec, where most people just go about their business on their own, market trading, mission running, mining you see alot of scams wardecs and you have no idea who s gona shoot you next. lowsec and Null corps can be amazing, because it s a group effort to keep your space safe and the sense of community is much stronger . In an enviroment of constant danger you know exactly who s gona try to shoot you and people look after each other.
---
I considered flair bait.  I actually thought I recognized the name.  Different hardin
---
It's one of the reasons i groan internally when deployments are announced.
---
literally last night i encountered this shit.
---
ferox fleet was pinged from our home station. the FC kindly took us to the staging station at the end of the op so we'd have our feroxes there for future fleets.
---
about half an hour later.... another ferox fleet ping, from the home station, where my ferox no longer was.
---
yeah, it's a ferox and it's cheap - but i had a perfectly good ferox there 2 hours ago now i don't. it's infuriating. it's shit like that that makes me think 'fuck it, i'll just go and play another game instead'.
---
That's what I wanted to hear.    Feeling HAMs and maybe a HML refit.  
---
Nobody is roaming around to potentially boosh some drones off of an AFK rorqual. If the rorq pilot is actually paying attention, though, the drones get dropped in a Wetu and the rorq has a PANIC, so time wasted.
---
Get out of the large F1 fleets and go join DKS or something, and actually experience the other side of this and you will understand.
---
Are you in Horde?
---
Capital umbrellas are fine just bring 300 ravens to kill anything in hostile space
---
he's a goon
---
hence why he's complaining about having to put any effort into this game besides logging in, hitting F1, and then logging out again
---
If you want interesting fights bring 200 dreads .... Otherwise fuckk off from my space
---
Admittedly I'd like EVE to be more casual, but I require TEST to have 4 separate stagings with like 5 bil worth of ships, so yeah 2 feroxes ain't hard.
---
Monitorfleet!
---
Tbh, China wouldn't be talking shit if donny was fighting them with hundreds of space battleships
---
It’s great, I cant keep up with demand I’m making so much isk
---
I really think deleting local would be a bigger blow to botting than any amount of countinued ambivalence by ccp.
---
AWS looks pretty on your resume.  
---
I'd like EVE to continue iterating on QoL improvements, like having a vaguely decent starting overview. It certainly doesn't need to be "more casual" though, that's probably the last thing it needs.
---
I don't think you know what the GTFO does.
---
well it's a job if you have a bunch of accounts and not enough isk making alts. if u only have 1-2 toons plexing isn't a job at all assuming you have decent sp on at least one of them. but if it costs 2b then yea, i can see what op is saying
---
I think we're talking about a similar thing.  Like I think it would be easier to run a corp/alliance, and therefore take less time to do it, if the corp hanger system wasn't so fucking terrible.  Things like that.
---
We differ over the definition of p2w.
---
To give you an idea of how there is debate over the exact meaning of p2w I refer you to this link:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8w417u/what_is_your_definition_for_pay_to_win/
---
For my position I contend that p2w is "Pay to win is any system where a player can purchase something that is not superficial or cosmetic," to quote the definition by the author of the thread I have linked above.
---
However the point is not to argue the definition of p2w or the relevant impact injectors may or may not have. The fact remains that injectors were not present in the game previously and yet they are now and can be purchased directly with irl money.
---
I would argue that it sets a precedent for the introduction of other p2w mechanisms which will eventually undermine the value of skills sets, experience and wealth as valued by older players of the game. Once aspects of a game can be monetized by p2w there is no going back. It only gets worse.
---
The process of p2w is insidious. It begins slowly and proceeds in steps over time, each step being a small increment, carefully restrained in impact as to prevent significant outrage on the greater part of the playing community. I believe this is quite deliberate, a company does not seek to disenfranchise too many customers at once. In the case of each step of p2w they most likely carefully estimate the relative costs of losing customers as balanced by the extra revenue p2w provides. If the estimate is profit positive then they proceed with the p2w step. 
---
Each step paves the way for further steps in p2w. Each step being mild enough that it can create divisiveness in the community when the topic is raised in forums such as this. This in turn, along with the precedents created by prior steps, allows p2w to progressively become accepted, if sometimes grudgingly, by the majority of the player base, especially since those who reject it the most have a tendency to leave and are replaced by players who accept it as a status quo or who have been convinced that it is a necessary evil. 
---
I was thinking about rewatching battlestar galactica I haven't watched it since it finished years ago.
---
This ends too soon
---
Good shout, that was so good. 
---
it’s because PGL is a retard, it’s really that simple
---
Perfect post, elegant colloquial summary of whats floating round in my head :)
---
Лиза - петушара, секрет Полишинеля.
---
"thank you mukk i think to balance booshers we should just give them a weapons timer and do nothing else.
---
thank you next" - ccp 2019
---
Haha yeah, I meant that I should be able I should be able to do the same stuff I do and spend less time doing it, because a lot of the stuff I do is dealing with corp and alliance shit that's unnecessarily tedious.  Poor wording.
---
it’s not really a new argument it’s just one that gets ignored because “htfu”
---
Update: The Wormhole adventure actually went pretty well.  I put down a marker at the wormhole entrance because I was afraid I would get lost or something, then I found my way to a mining site and started mining something called Dark Orchre (I thought the name was cool).  I got to mine 96 before NPC pirate showed up.  There was only one ship so I figured id try and fight him (BAD IDEA) He tore me a new one in just a volley or two... I panicked and jumped to another area near by but there were four or five pirates there so I bravely went home.
---
rorqs are only too safe because caps/supers have no real counterplay. a rorq without a super umbrella is not safe at all! it just dies 7min later...
---
complaining about rorqs being too safe is like complaining your radiator is too weak while having your windows open all the time!
---
you can't break supercaps with fax support when fielding only subcaps without 4 times the numbers. so give subs a buff relative to super, that automatically decreases the umbrella safety which also indirectly nerfs rorq safety
---
The tengu is the best bet for clearing c3 sites due to missile range and active tanking. The loki might be good also but I actually haven't tried to make a fit for it.
---
The issue is c3 relic and data sites hurt like a bitch. Even with a blinged tengu you're going to be pushed to your limit in terms of tank. If you're dead set on trying it, bring blue pill and a set of crystals might not be the worst idea.
---
You'd have better luck with a rattlesnake, but that's a bigger target and can't scan so.
---
The other issue you're going to run into is storage. Missiles take up a lot of space. Blue loot will add up. Your cloak and mobile depot and probe Launcher take up a lot of space. If you have an alt who can fly a blockade runner I recommend it. Carrying spare missiles, stashing your blue loot, hiding cloaked when you're in site so if you get ganked your blue loot is safe.
---
Now as someone who's done this in the past, my advice is steer clear of relic and data sites and just run combat sites. Sleeper data and relic sites aren't worth much beyond the blue loot and it will enable you to have a cheaper tengu. 
---
Absolutely. With any of those individual points there are a ton of possible solutions / nerfs / buffs / changes which can steer them in the right direction. The problem seems to be people being hung up on any individual solution (i.e. HAW Titan's should be nerfed because of XYZ situation) rather than acknowledging that more broadly stuff isn't dangerous enough. 
---
I'm just hoping that if we can all agree on the fundamentals, it at least puts us into a framework where we can assess if any proposed changes are going to be improving or impacting the health of the game. 
---
Also, let's face it. CCP is almost never going to directly implement community suggestions for multiple reasons. Hopefully we can at least agree on the underlying principles and let CCP implement it in a way they feel is achievable. 
---
 bestest TEST has been a good boy and wanted treats from papa goon
---
https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0243qz
---
Plus the fact that even though people have more alts, the playerbase hasn't increased
---
one of your produest wanks ?
---
this dude looks like some weirdo incel lmfao
---
HAW dreads are not that good. You folks are so caught up on them now because you see people like Lussy jump one into a group of awful newbro pilots that constantly faceplant themselves into dual webs. But that's not at all what happens on a daily basis. The other capital classes are so much worse for stifling subcap pvp. 
---
what? The Rorqual already have insane tank without PANIC, you can easily tank 50+ bombers as long as you have booster. 
---
they also have the ability to save almost all their value in a mobile depot. 
---
Just remove PANIC, no need for buffs
---
An industrial tanking 100 ppl is fine plz dont nerf my baby
---
Implement a change where junping your caps to a system in tidi. Is affected by that systems tidi. 
---
That's what they are like in j-space!
---
Dreads are really not the issue. HAW dreads are pretty well balanced.
---
The issue is with carriers/supers being able to apply to anything grid wide and volleying anything that is not brick tanked
---
Thats what I was thinking as far as tengus go. Ammo is always a problem so looks like i will have to settle on stratios and play smart about it and skip the c3s....
---
They'll just have a scout on every ingate on their system. When they see you decloak on gate to jump the bots will warp. 
---
Holy shit I thought I was the only one re watching stargate, this is great
---
I’ve never heard it called that before ??
---
Hey boosh fleets are cool, but what do groups do if they cant form enough ravens to break a fax? Use one of the one, maybe two other doctrines that might actually work in super specific conditions? Or just eat shit anyway because titans will still ruin your day?
---
Just because something gets needed, doesn't mean something has to be buffed.
---
Rorqs can already fit massive tanks, why would a nerf of PANIC mean that had to be buffed?
---
tbh the craziest thing and its something that pgl said in his post as well is that the balance "team" is a joke. balance needs to just happen more often. balance should be an ongoing thing not something that happens once every 6 months, especially when the change is just tweaking a few numbers.
---
the fax changes that happened late last year was literally just changing a few stats on modules, after 2 years of fax being the way they were (and still are) lmao
---
what a cunning stunt
---
Flair bait is stupid 95% of the time.
---
It's good when it points out bias.  It's stupid when it's just "durr hurr, I'm not even in that alliance".
---
Stratios can't deal with c3 sites in my experience, although it's been a long time since I tried. The Nestor is an option if you're looking to do drone boats, but like you said, big target. Although once you're in site the lack of covert ops doesn't really matter since you can't cloak until you get off anyway, and a Nestor isn't actually that expensive compared to a well fit t3c, especially since you don't lose sp (fuck that mechanic) 
---
The only thing I'll say is that c2 site isk sucks. C3 site isk is such a step up, in the same vein that C5 isk is ludicrously better than c4 isk.
---
There's no easy solution to the missile problem though. It was the thing that basically made me spin up an alt for the first time, and then later join a wh Corp.
---
Best of luck to you though, whatever you choose. If you need help with fits or whatever feel free to pm me if you don't feel comfortable posting them publicly. 
---
Yeah this was my advice to him.
---
hehe unwashed retards who most of the time gang up on random people and/or cause random property damage are bad lol 
---
Its so fun catching something juicy on a moon just to have your tackle perma jammed/webbed down
---
Why even mention boosh Ravens when the only place they can be used is offensively and on a keepstar grid...any other grid they will have to be to close to the hostile fleet. 
---
Pretty sure CCP is reslonsible for running 99% of the bots in Eve. They profit from this shit. Any 1st year economics student can see why.
---
HAWs are stupid and broken.  
---
Dreads are weak.  
---
I guess if you combine the two you get some kind of weird balance.
---
Bot witch hunts are ruining this subreddit tbh.
---
No, that would not work. Today it's not difficult to adapt bots so that they can simulate a grinding player perfectly - including variations in reaction time etc.
---
For better detection some anti cheat software in the client would probably help. Of course this has problems of its own and is not 100% effective either.
---
Absolutely. There is very little reason that there shouldn't be fortnightly changes to module stats tweaking things as the meta changes / things develop. 
---
Yes, full skill / module reworks should happen less often, but simply tweaking numbers in a database (i.e. battleship cargo hold?!) should not be any where near as rare as it is. 
---
She was in fact a witch in the movie, not sure what you're trying to get at here
---
Learning from one's mistakes? Gosh, who'd have thought right? I guess that's why everyone else adapts and you whine to the devs.
---
They are indeed fun.
---
I think you should, actually, or the 4b isk ship that tackles itself for 5 minutes at a time would be pretty worthless.
---
can we please stop reposting actual nazis thanks
---
a fucking google results page is your playerbase count proof? 
---
While launching specific accounts for specific playstyles is cool, wouldn't it be even cooler to launch specific characters on specific accounts for specific playstyles?
---
Lets say you have 5 accounts, but on each account there is one miner, one pve'er and one pvp or support. It would be cool to launch all the miners with one push of a button, or all pve'ers.
---
Do you think they could be implemented eventually?
---
Imagine being so retarded you dont notice an inhib being anchored, so you dont light your cyno in the solid minute you are given
---
That's pay to ADVANCE, pay to WIN implies that spending money gives you an advantage over a regular player that can not be obtained without a purchase. By that definition being an Omega player makes the game Pay to win which it most certainly does not
---
Why is PLEX price skyrocketing like that ? 
---
Yup, if you flairbait and then call someone retarded for not knowing what alliance your random reddit account belongs too, they are not the retard. You are.
---
I didn't figure they could but I'm just coming back from a few months off and looking for some fun. I've run lvl 4s til im blue in the face and have it down where I make a few billion isk a month, i also day trip but i just wanted some excitement. I took a gnosis out recently off to "whereever" before i took a break and ended up dying to a null sec gate camp but was alot of fun just being out there.
---
I thought about joining a wormhole corp but my schedule is so erratic with work and home im afraid to be a pain in the ass and unreliable. Hate flying these bigass ships. I love cruisers but making money out of them is proving to be tough so I thought I'd give this a shot. C3 is aiming high but yea c1s and 2s isk is pretty bunk. I make 100m an hour rolling SOE lvl 4s. I dont guess i want the isk to be super awesome but I need some fun damnit. And the 3 null sec corps ive been in have been horrible experiences. PL was bad, TEST ended up siding with goons during their little north vs south war and being a pawn was shit, but Yulai Federation was probably the worst. Danger zone were some cool guys i just never wanted to side with "the biggest alliance" so i bolted. 
---
This is a really good summary of the issues facing eve at the moment, hopefully one of our elected pencil pushers sees this
---
Personally I don’t agree with nerfing faxs more (I think that’d just be a big bonus to zerg alliances) but hey nobody will agree with 100% of things.
---
Seriously, the last League tournament was pretty much the largest event in history, excluding things like the Olympics. It peaked at 200 MILLION concurrent viewers, shattering even Super Bowl viewership. Gaming has never been bigger.
---
Welcome to eve online :) you won't get this kind of adrenaline rushes in any other mmos. But you should definitely join a group; older players have knowledge they are eager to share, and this game is as deep as the ocean, it's easy to drown yourself if alone. 
---
They are not new.  They have been a thing ever since capitals were introduced.  In fact, they used to be even more OP than now.
---
based and redpilled
---
So, ive always wondered this,  but without the pvp element, what are you really mining for?
---
New players don’t play this game... this must be an elaborate scam
---
If anything means keepstar. Then sure. 
---
[removed]
---
Except he is doing the opposite of learning from this mistake.  
---
To clarify, the mistake being; losing the anchoring keepstar to subcaps while having supercaps, titans, carriers and subcaps on grid.  
---
If they had learned from said mistake, they would discuss counters to the booshfleet ravens in this topic.   
---
But OP didn't. Instead he brings up booshing ravens as a clear and definate counter to titans with support on grid. He goes as far as to claim that TEST is in the wrong for not having booshing fleets. All the while ignoring possible counters to booshing ravens. OP even goes as far as to suggest that PGL should not request balance changes, because he does not employ this "absolutely critical" doctrine himself.
---
So yeah, "some people" surely do learn from mistake and analyse what went wrong but not OP in this post.
---
BOOM HEADSHOT!
---
And this is why you are literally the DBRB of TEST. You can not think ahead or out of the box. 
---
\- Those titans on grid are probably focussing on other stuff that is on grid. After all there is a reason they are on grid and not for the sole purpose because somebody brought a Raven fleet. So they can shoot Ravens while melting to capitals or they can shoot capitals while bleeding faxes to the Ravens. Obviously you are targeting the T1 battleships in this situation. 
---
\- Oh geez Mukk refitted his Ravens to better match the doctrines on the grid. How dares he adjust things!
---
\- lol. 
---
If only the balance team was as dedicated as old school runescape :(
---
Strongly disagreeing... Any neut in a wormhole is a valid target, as they can probe a way in your system to unwanted tourists. But killing him doesn't prevent you from being honorable and spending some iskies on the poor newbro... And explaining to him why he died. 
---
Stargate Atlantis is one of the best shows ever.
---
so as you point out, blob is still the actual problem
---
not the caps or subcaps
---
remove player owned ships from overview.
---
remove fleet broadcasts.
---
let pilots pilot their own ships.
---
problem solved
---
Sounds like you're in a very similar position to where I was in eve. I started, ran l4s and was bored as hell, then started day tripping into nullsec and wormholes out of lowsec holes because hisec ones are always camped. That got me a taste for pvp and better isk for more risk and that led me to day tripping and eventually to joining a wormhole Corp.
---
I will say this however, despite how erratic your schedule may be, you'll be able to find a home in a number of wormhole corps. Plenty of them don't have huge activity requirements, just show up on the occasional fleet or scan the chain sometimes, and they offer a great way to make isk.
---
Some corps I can recommend for are
---
-Sinners Trajectory(Chain Smoking), they're good dudes, and great with new players. I know their ceo and he's a standup guy.
---
-Stranger Danger, exact same deal, but they're more EU than US. Whichever fits your schedule better.
---
-Of sound Mind. Sound is one of the big wormhole corps, up their in scale with the other big 5-5 boys, but they've got a culture of teaching Newbros how to kick ass in wormhole space. Their Corp culture isn't for everyone (it's something of a safe space, which lots of people like, lots don't.)
---
-No vacancies, one of the big four of wormhole space, maybe even the big three, their culture is less newbro friendly but they class themselves as wormhole business casual. Meaning they don't expect crazy activity of skill points.
---
I'm not sure where your sp is, and there's dozens of corps I haven't mentioned that all fit the bill of allowing for erratic scheduling and don't require alts. Taking a look on eve jobs is a good way to look for yourself.
---
But anyway, if you're going nomadic, stratios and sticking to c2s and relic/data is probably the way to go. If you're looking for more profitable day tripping, make a tengu and go scan lowsec. Carry refits to be insta warp and cloaky and you'll be fine in low. That way you can find a c3 because there's tons of c3/ls, and sell the loot between wormholes, since there's a lot of blue loot stations in low, and just run back to hisec for more missiles whenever. Or see if you can find some in lowsec. Plenty of lowsec areas stock ammo, admittedly at a markup. 
---
One thing CCP, and listen to it carefully ok?
---
\&gt;&gt;&gt;Don't expect big profits without investing!&lt;&lt;&lt;
---
Srly why You going that current shitty fashion of doing as less as possible in game? Well EA, Bethesda and rest such approach is just backstabbing them now.
---
Why instead of hiring true balance team, more artists, devs etc You just introduce injectors (cancer) and doing skins (cool but it's just small addon).
---
Also instead of investing in EVE You try and waste $ on doomed from start projects like fps...
---
There's so much to be done in eve, more than ever and yet developing process is slow as never before.
---
That's why players fly away, im also not investing any more because i see no constant big updates.
---
Balance is a joke, incredible joke tbh. Wormholes are left for years and groups having fun in them are just bored and left, PVE is stone age, mining is just visuals instead of at least adding some variety like ring mining and comets mining, incursions same as WH, FW... ,NPE is still crap because it needs true campaign where newbies will learn about game and mechanics by playing that long story campaign (thanks to jump clones possibilities are limitless because You can put newbie even in caps in some Abbysal space so they will get boner, so much epic missions to make), UI is outdated and overcomplicated as fu.. srly this and lack of campaign is the biggest flaw of eve because it limit new players incomming very much.
---
Overall i think that eve needs a lot more invest, problably dedicated team for every big aspect for game like team for WH, team for PVE, team for Null and caps etc so there will be constant like x2 per year updates to those game areas.
---
&gt; Those titans on grid are probably focussing on other stuff that is on grid
---
I would not base any strategies on this hopeful assumption.
---
I want to expand on this a little more. Since I thought about it. 
---
What I said is true. But there is a way around it. If person D also joins the limited engagement by shooting person B aswel. He will be in the same limited engagement and is free to rep person C
---
lol, what?  This is such a wrong post.  You're clearly not an FC at all.
---
- The titans are very quickly going to eliminate the 680 DPS glass cannon battleships sitting in prime face rape range, unless there is another capital fleet on grid, but that's now what he's talking about is it?
---
- It was Pando.
---
- Lol
---
Skill injectors and Rorquals. That’s why we are where we are today.
---
Skill injectors for removing the effort/time in training super/capital toons, and rorquals being essentially unkillable under a capital umbrella due to PANIC is also a secondary economic problem which is magnified by the first.
---
If you really wanted to fix the game you should have started with those two first. 
---
As it is right now you’ve started with things that fucked your objectives, which obviously everyone is going to take apart. 
---
You're smarter than this guy.
---
Before we had skill injectors and rorquals, titans were still king.  There's just more of them now.
---
There's also a lack of dictors and hot wings in his post. That world have help him get more traction. 
---
still am, won most my fights last year.
---
I err... Uh-what?
---
I dunno. I never had a issue with TIDI. The way I see it. We can play the game in slow motion, or not at all cause the servers caught on fire. 
---
I'd think tracking mouse movements on the client side would go a long way towards providing a useable data point to the Security Team. A bot will never be able to match the random nature of a human's mouse movements across the screen. Not perfectly anyway. Obviously they'd need other points to key off of, but it all starts with monitoring the client itself via some type of anti-cheat system, like you mentioned.
---
I am totally fine with a pack of goon jackdaws turning up just to watch HORDEbrain posters explode in local and Reddit.
---
And every random wormhole that spawns in system too? The bots will be able to instantly scan them down and warp to them, right....?
---
OP, think about skill injectors, rorquals/panic, super capital proliferation. I don't think the problems in this game can be attributed to sirens, burst projectors or HAW titans.
---
#TIPIKAL TAPI BEGGING TEH GON 
---
Make certain skills (mostly cap and advanced stuff) not injectable!
---
I know alot of damage is already done and it wont happen cause skill extractors/injectors make CCP money but its an easy fix. New players or low sp pilots could still "catch up" while injecting the 20th rorq toon wouldnt be possible.
---
Remove panic mod for rorqs.
---
Remove ref timer on low power structures.
---
Give caps a spool up time to lock cynos/give cynos a spool up time.
---
Give anomoly rats much much more tackle/diamond rat/AI.
---
I think you're totally right. There isn't enough demand to replace ships to even out the crazy supply the market has from intense krabbing.
---
* Cyno counter play needs to be a thing. Give cynos a spool up timer where the ship is locked in place and the beacon lights but nothing can jump to it, giving whoever is being dropped on time to react and shoot it/run.
---
* Lower supercap EHP and all capital rep strength. Let em die faster.
---
* Lower capital gun tracking. HAWs should be able to hit BSs and if your lucky BCs, and cap guns shouldn't be able to hit subcaps at all.
---
* Lower fighter speed so they can't effectively chase subcaps around a field but can guard an area on a grid effectively. Don't nerf them into oblivion but give them a role and counter play.
---
* Nerf Rorq mining output dramatically. Buff rorq mining boosts so the optimal way to mine becomes 1 rorq and a fleet of exhumes. Also nerf PANIC and rorq local tank.
---
* Nerf the capital production bonuses on engineering complexes. Make caps take longer to build and be more expensive.
---
* Lower the insurance pay out. Caps should not be less expensive to loose than many battleships.
---
* Don't listen to me because I'm talking out of my sleep deprived ass.
---
Live wallpaper of TEST zkill losses
---
When there are 50 dudes sitting on a single dude and they are unable to kill him then yes, there's a problem. A very big one
---
I don't doubt that VNI bots exist. I've seen them over the years, but I don't think carriers and supers bot. They just warp out when a neut appears for logical reasons.
---
Indeed, and they also had entirely different utility as there were no HAW/bosons/GTFOs. Back before skill injectors this wouldn’t have been such an issue, since titans were so few in number, relatively speaking. 
---
But do you actually see that skill injectors/Unkillable rorqs has brought all this about? You can’t fix an issue by treating the symptoms, you need to fix the root of the problem. 
---
We're talking about how he got ganked in a 0.9 system. Probably his school system. In a noob ship. 
---
Yeah. If you want to rely on random wormhole spawns. Sure...
---
No doubt, balance changes should be coming within days when an issue is seen, specially stat changes, instead of being delayed for months for that 'one big update'.
---
Progodlegends only agenda is pushing eve even harder into the blob wins everything meta. Just a coincidence that he is one of the mains FCs of the second biggest blob on the game lmao
---
Wait did you just say Titans weren't as big of a deal back in the day because they didn't have HAWs/Bosons/GTFOs?
---
I rest my case.
---
I'm a 9 day old noobie. The bots I found were really bots. Also known as NPCs.
---
It did for a short time. At least until larger groups realized how insanely oppressive it is and just started stomping on anything by moving their capital fleets to sit on smaller alliances faces, or simply built new captal fleets all over the map after the rorqual changes. As it stands now, there are very few - if any- small groups left in null having all been stomped out. Nullsec now feels far safer and more bland than it ever did pre-Phoebe. It was probably one of the single worst patches ever IMO.
---
Hey, mining is very fun. Ask goons. Oh wait
---
No
---
Why not? :(
---
The other problem with throwing balance updates in a single big update is that they end up changing too much. They try to adjust a bunch of different things all at once, more often than not creating a whole new set of issues that would have been caught ahead of time if the changes had been introduced gradually one by one.
---
From what I notice shooting people in highsec. Theran alliance does a bad job at explaining their wardecks. The amount of hate I get when I shoot a new player in their alliance is insane. 
---
I feel like you'll be better off joining a newbie alliance instead of null renters. 
---
Generally logging won't work either, because the gankers will just agro you to get a timer with a cheap ship like an Ibis.
---
&gt; unfortunately the dread can volley subcaps so fast off the field that you re basecly forced to jump in other capital ships to kill the dude
---
This is just totally not true. If you have enough to kill a rorq, a HAW dread is easy. 
---
I think part of that point - fortnightly balance changes - is by far the best solution to a lot of these problems. Not because they'd inherently solve problems, but because it would free CCP up to be less cautious (which in the current state, is well warranted) with balance changes like these.
---
If there were fortnightly patches with very simple changes - no new assets or anything ,just attribute changes, it would minimize the risk and effort involved, but if a change didn't work out, it's only up there for a week!
---
Not sure what wardecks are and null renters hhaha, I don’t get mad when I get blown up tbh, but I moved back to high security for the mean time so I can live a little longer, but I still get blown trying to get to Jita from time to time.. I would of probably joined a newbie Corp but I set my home at their base so now I have to wait a year for a new home :(
---
I 200000% disagree.
---
WH space is a fucking nightmare to learn on and I love it. There is PLENTY of opportunities to bring more complexity to the game and even more advanced sites or challenges.
---
Make sites that require more people, mobiles depots to switch on fits regularly, prevent warp out, bombs that get launched randomly on the grid. Make it just harder and you will get that content. 
---
It is not because some players doesn't have any inspirations in EvE system, neither in it's PvE that may have been wrongly noted as inexistant, that the game has no PvE opportunities.
---
You can always build up new mechanics and bring more difficult chalenges.
---
I'm sure part of us would love to know there are some fights that are only accessible to well organized sized fleet (5 - 15 - 40 - 100 ?)
---
the actual problem is blobs
---
remove player owned ships from overview. remove fleet broadcasts. let pilots pilot their own ships.
---
no.
---
That's not how homes work. You can only change it remotely once a year. But you can change home station at any time if you travel there yourself. 
---
Amen. Game is stale as hell
---
i was pretty shitfaced last night and i thought i would be sneaky by avoiding new caldari and instead going through perimeter to avoid the tidi... perimeter was where the actual fight was happening x_x
---
i agree with what ur saying . but i hate that ur proposing this . coz ur allience got boinked in north
---
Funny isnt it?! easy fix would be to make the belt spawn +500km off. In that case i can even warp to the miners rock instead of burning cause i landed 80km off.
---
Hijacking comment but, CCPlz in the new settings panel add more than screen fps, it doesnt have to be stable at all mark it as experimental and everyone will be happy or sth (FPS limit lower than screen fps is in client settings file but not in eve settings so its against eula to change it)
---
Did somer blink once. Won a JF. And never toutched it again. 
---
I don't think it does anything. Think it's just there to provide flavour to the game.
---
https://i.imgur.com/cAiblrw.png
---
that's not what we're talking about dumby
---
It's not like it's a recent problem either.
---
I remember when the Svipul was introduced, basically left untouched for a year or 2 (refresh my memory here). Or the amount of time it took to finally adust T3C's e.t.c. e.t.c.
---
I generally won't undock for less than 2b an hour
---
What if I told you. You can do both? 
---
&gt;Skill injectors and Rorquals. That’s why we are where we are today.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Skill injectors for removing the effort/time in training super/capital toons, and rorquals being essentially unkillable under a capital umbrella due to PANIC is also a secondary economic problem which is magnified by the first.  
---
&gt;If you really wanted to fix the game you should have started with those two first.  
---
&gt;As it is right now you’ve started with things that fucked your objectives, which obviously everyone is going to take apart.
---
This is wrong, stupid and ignorant. How do you stupid people still think injectors and rorqs are the core of the problem? Yes they speed the process of the problem up, but that doesn't make them THE PROBLEM!
---
1. Injectors: all it changes, is that you have to pay 50bn to fly a cap decently instead of waiting for 1.5yrs. Period, that is the difference, nothing more. **So with injectors we have the problem now instead of in a year...** That's the only difference injectors make. (I would be happy if you clearly show how I am wrong, but after 1 year of whining, noone ever was able to show how injectors make the game otherwise unbalanced)
---
2. Rorqs, they mine alot, and they are pretty safe, I give you that.
---
1. They mine alot, this got nerfed alot already. And I think it can be even more, but compared to hulks, they "only" mine twice the amount of hulks, which is alot, but that alone does not break the scale.
---
2. Rorqs are multiboxable: this is quite a problem, but honestly, mining is quite passive, and I nor any other person seem to have a good idea to make it more active, therefore less multiboxable. Anyways, this is also possible with standard mining barges. So the problem does not arise from this.
---
3. Rorqs are too invulnerable, well ye. Actually rorqs themself are pretty vulnerable thanks to the "siege" and the changes to mobile depot and active tank nerfs. BUT they become invulnerable with the capital/super umbrella. HOWEVER, **everything within a super umbrella and a cyno is basically invulnerable.** So the only way to make rorqs more vulnerable, is to give subcap/hunter groups a tool or more tools to actually outplay these capital drops. This would solve basically all problems, large scale capital battles vs subcap fleets vs supercapital fleets as well as the "unlimited" safety for rorqs.
---
I remember when there was no Plex. And I sold a 60 day game time card for 300 mil. 
---
Asset safety should cost more but decrease to current levels as time goes on. This makes defending destroying structures more meaningful, but won't hurt people who get called away from the game for a few months.
---
(its why ravens work) i probably put it in the wrong comment thread though
---
CCP rubbed out any in game isk/equipment out with a EULA change so EOH, EVE-bet and alike got rubbed out. 
---
Oh you life saver, you spared me so much future headache.. thank you so much for this info
---
ya did, but that's all good homie
---
This. Why be a dick when it takes 2 minutes of your time to make back what means the world to a noob?
---
daer seagull saying we were going to get a dedicated balance team?
---
Really, I am pretty sure, some had always problems... And large scale spamming was, as I remember always really hard on the system.
---
However, they said, that mostly the large scale changing of local participants were the main problem. That's why jita with the most players joining/leaving local had the most problems. So people that are in jita gotta answer this question....
---
Because if local works now with the new system, it would be quite nice for future development of the game, as far as I heard from CCP
---
no because even if you drop your titans in range of the ravens they just reposition tot he other side of the structure, you need multiple squads on multiple titnas positioned around the structure at compass points including up and down to even stand a chance at threatening them, this gives you multiple points where hostiles can either bump and remove your assets from fax range or force you to split up your faxes onto multiple engagement areas - both of which are gonna leave you in a bad position hence why they arent done
---
Clickbait
---
Just stretch out the game and move the center point to 1 screen. 
---
Snuff always have been always will be Snuff aka undependable and not worthy of faith or trust. You only have one thing in EVE that is your word. After you lose that you are worthless.
---
Oh good lord this post. Right lets answer some points
---
&gt; 1 With fatigue, the ease of saving things with FAX, and the balance point between Dreads and Titans + Triage, large EVE polities have "Capital Umbrellas" in which they can abuse their capitals with minimal risk.
---
Yup welcome to a culmination of multiple changes to the game that make this possible. Jump Fatigue introduction, FAX introduction, Rorqual super buff and subsequently only minor nerfs, Skill Injectors
---
Not any one of the above is to blame for the current situation/meta but the combination has lead it there.
---
&gt; 2 Within a capital umbrella, capital movement is way too fast. Cyno -&gt; Jump to cyno -&gt; Arrive anywhere in seconds. This particularly punishes subcapital skirmishers.
---
Its been like this since the introduction of cynos but only now its a problem? I think its the case of everyone is expected to be in at least a capital and the push for everyone to be in supers/titans. I remember when PL/NC were infamous for dropping supers and titans on anything that moved.
---
&gt; 3 "End game" capital combat between large capital fleets is very boring and static. The titans try to load grid, and then focus doomsdays. Play-counterplay is limited to a few gimicky tether effects, the Capital Emergency Hull Energizer, initial positioning, and gaming resists if the enemy has only brought armor or only brought shield titans.
---
"End Game" capital balance never took into consideration the numbers of supers/titans that are available in game. There is a famous quote from CCP stating there would only ever be a handful of titans in the game at one time. Now there is a handful of titans on every staging keepstar AFK 24/7!!!
---
&gt; 4 Rorquals are too safe under a capital umbrella with their panic invulnerability.
---
Plenty of badly piloted rorqs die every day in New Eden. 
---
I personally would argue for rorqs to have shorter cyno cycles similar to how recons have, because at the moment it goes like this:
---
You are tackled, You see a cyno inhib onlining, you light cyno. The FC now knows he has at least 10 Minutes to get help to you. You tank for another minute or so before panic. The FC still knows he has at least 5 minutes if not 7 to get to you and all he has to do is make sure the rorq is coming out of indy core and all will be well with the world.
---
But when the rorq doesnt get a cyno lit before the inhib goes down....Now its a whole different situation. Now you are warping faxes to save the rorq. Now you have to counter dictors landing on the in cyno preventing you form supporting the rorq. You also have to waste a minute or so of travel time before faxes land on the rorq. Now there is far more risk involved.
---
You make it so that a rorq doesnt have a SAVE ME button for 10 minutes with no counter. You will see a lot more edge case rorqs dying. FC's being pushed to get fleets in before the cyno dies with sub optimal numbers or bad compositions.
---
&gt; 5 Skill injectors hypercharge EVE balance problems, and synergize with ratting and mining capitals under a capital umbrella to create runaway economic effects.
---
Yup only point I agree with 100% here.
---
&gt; Progodlegend doesn't touch these problems in his opening post. Instead he has prioritized asking for nerfs for titans' abilities to kill subcapitals.
---
&gt;I just don't get it. Of all capital balance problems GTFOs are top of the list? The opening post doesn't include the word Rorqual.
---
Every man and his dog knows that rorqs are broken. Its been brought up multiple times over the past few years about how rorqs ruin the game blah blah blah yet nothing has been done about it. 
---
&gt; The Init Booshball Raven fleet was on the field. The Ravens kept the keepstar at damage cap while dancing away from the fighters, far outside of HAW range. Panfam was forced to send out our subcap fleets to chase the Ravens. We got split up. Our subcaps were outnumbered and failed to coordinate. We didn't support each other. We were overwhelmed in a sea of baddies.
---
So the same tactic you perfected in CVA space and one that I remember you actively counter with a chemo Mach fleet on an Init fort when they first appeared is being touted as the best answer to all of this? Also on that keepstar fight you focused a lot on the support fleets while leaving your fighters to focus on the Ravens for half the fight...... You chemo'd the TEST bombers vs the init ravens.
---
What happens if Command Dessies get slightly nerfed by say long points preventing MJD or the Radius being made smaller etc. What then? Relying on 1 gimmick to counter an ever growing problem with super cap proliferation sure sounds like an easy way to kill 
---
1: the meta
---
2: Innovation
---
3: Enjoyment of the game
---
&gt; There have been no TAPI Rokh fleets.
---
I seem to remember the D-G rout started as a Rokh fleet vs a Boosh Rokh fleet over the athanor in system.
---
It would be great if the large null fcs could drop the egos, get together and talk through this. The community is so fragmented right now, if we can't agree on what needs to be addressed, CCP won't have a clue.
---
Ok so since it's now time to talk about the H-5 Keepstar fight, lets talk about what went wrong.
---
You don't use your supers and titans to kill a boosh fleet.  You use a specialized anti boosh subcap fleet (a combination of interceptors and nullified t3s) plus your own subcaps and a light fighter blob to keep constant pressure and follow up on kills when you successfully disrupt them.
---
Instead, you use your supers and titans to kill the subcap fleets that are screening for the boosh fleet first.  You guys tried to kill the boosh fleet but couldn't because their subcap fleets kept you from using the right tactics to do so, but all you had to do was bring either Horde or someone else in a large tackle fleet, and then tackle the normal enemy subcap fleets and annihilate them in like seconds.  You could have probably split your super fleet into two halves and done this twice based on numbers.
---
It would have been tough, but with some more prep and some more hyping very doable.
---
As much as i agree with some of the points raised, CCP aint doing shit about injectors and we all know this. It's a sad state of affairs but it's the truth :(
---
That's a lot of words for saying it's a pretty shit game which we only play because there's no alternatives.
---
lol.
---
&gt;remove asset safety
---
In what world does this do anything but allow my alliance to descend upon Eve like a locust swarm, reaping every large or XL structure for its delicious creme filling? 
---
So if want to move my carrier or dread or titan or super , I have so sit there with a cYno for prob. 30+ secs because otherwise people start crying again and basically scream in local to inform everyone that I will move at least a capital ship in here ?😂sounds like a Great idea for everyone who wants to move a capital ship 
---
probably a plex sale coming up then, 
---
How to counter boosh ravens:  Slowboat fighters to them -&gt; When they MJD you MWD after them with the fighters 
---
&gt;Wasn't the cultural revolution a goon thing?
---
This was 2012 or so.  GSF and TEST were blue/in the same coalition at this point, had shared forums/service/fleet access.  He was bent out of shape about GSF forums/fleet moderation.
---
Well either you can dock where the cyno is, you open it on a safe spot (as it only shows up on grid until its active). Its the point to make it more dangerous. And if 30 secs is too long for you to wait why are you even playing eve. And you have 30 secs to react kf someone opens a cyno on you
---
heavy webs on lets say a vindi for example will allow a cap guns to pretty much insta pop a BS
---
He said titans were fewer in number. Read it again.
---
Winter intel? :) I'm in there.
---
ho yes it's easy to simulate the random nature of moving a mouse.
---
What are you trying to say? A counter has a counter so it's not really a counter at all?
---
ccp just needs to hold a fanfest out in international waters and have a casino there 
---
maybe graduate from ibisfleet lol
---
and a 2nd year economic student can see why not.
---
Yeah as far as book condition ratings go that's about right.
---
&gt; this dude ~~sounds/writes like~~ is some weirdo incel lmfao
---
ftfy
---
İts good as long as you can read it
---
Actually with ABs the ravens tanked titans okayish in one of those lowsec brawls.

I prob. Spent more time waiting then you will ever do in eve but having a delay on the cYno is only good for someone who doesn’t want the ship he has tackle to be defend otherwise it will just fuck everyone up that doesn’t use a cYno to defend rorquals which is the main prob. People crying about .. if u want to have shiny killmails u need to risk something .. 
---
Not part of super umbrella shit btw 
---
Capital umbrella this.. Capital umbrella that.. sounds so whiny. The one thing I can really agree on is balance issue of skill injectors. CCP needs to change the diminishing returns of injector usage and or make them similar to accelerators with expiry terms. Rorquals are very safe in null but those slow squishy excavators are not, and they cost more than the ship itself. Fight outside the umbrella, split the cap fleet, attack multiple targets to run up there fatigue( I miss the old Fatigue model before the changes) Maybe mobile cyno inhibs need a slight buff in hp and spool time, something to consider asking for?? Back in the day, if u didn't want to deal with skirmishers ud just dock up till the leave, now crabs have teeth so get creative and be opportunistic.
---
fuck no.
---
i'm not looking for sympathy.
---
I'm just illustrating that the logistics of having to have a million ships in a million places is a turn off. I infinitely prefer home defense to bullshit deployments.
---
firstly, home defense is significantly less logistical bullshit to deal with - and secondly, i actually have a reason to care about the fleet and the objective.
---
at least deployments, currently, aren't so logistically tedious because we have a narrow number of ships that we require, if that were to increase it'd just be less incentive for me to bother and instead i'd just go and play other games or do other activities.
---
like i said, i appreciate that using the same ship over and over can get monotonous - but not as monotonous as constantly moving a bunch of shit back and forth that does little more than gather dust because the doctrine is nearly never called for because you have so many goddamn doctrine ships
---
the industrial won't have to tank 100 people if those 100 people are shredding your barges instead.
---
Actually pointing it out yourself just ruins it. More enjoyable to silently bask it all in while someone chimps at you for the fake spaceship game alliance you rep on a fake discussion board.
---
nope. In WH they are 50% dropped or destroyed. 0% asset recovery
---
In the current meta? Probably not much. It would mean that the consequence of a goon invasion is certainly more impactful. 
---
In conjunction with other changes though perhaps it would actually allow some counter play. What if goons attempting to do that meant that your home was actually vulnerable to fast raids destroying structures instead of week long timers? What if it wasn't possible to simply out capital blob the invaders doing counter play but rather requires a significant force still at home?
---
That said, as with everything I pointed out in the post, it's about acknowledging the underlying theme (eve isn't dangerous enough at the moment) rather than getting tied up over any one suggestion (such as this one). Certainly in the past when a station was captured and the loser had to fire sale their stuff it didn't kill eve. 
---
Did you ever tried it in 10-15% tidi?
---
They still mine like 3.5 times as much as a hulk IIRC.
---
U NO SAY!
---
You drop one titan each time the ravens relocate? That's one way to do it i suppose.
---
Wouldn't recommend testing on TQ though.
---
&gt; Rorquals are too safe under a capital umbrella with their panic invulnerability.
---
Lots of people are saying that Rorqs are a problem, because they survive too easily and mine too much.
---
But:
---
- good mining ships -&gt; cheap ore -&gt; cheap ships -&gt; more fights
---
For everyone. Of course that includes the big blocs, but everything that helps smaller alliances will also profit the big blocs.
---
Then there's people posting about "But muh pvp content, can't kill the Rorqs." Are you kidding me? If the pvp content you're looking for is defenseless miners, maybe you shouldn't pvp. Attacking a Rorq spawns a defense fleet, there's your pvp content.
---
IMHO mining is a necessity for ship production, which is necessary for pvp. Why make it unnecessarily hard? The Rorq isn't the problem, the capital is.
---
Nnnnno. 
---
There are a lot of booshes in there. In that fight we had like 20 i think.

What about a DOTA 2 style compendium?
---
Yeah and I'm saying it's too safe.
---
What timer? In what circumstance, when under a capital umbrella, is there a reason to not immediately light the cyno if tackled?
---
Dread is throwaway glasscannon, no more, no less, theres nothing wrong with haws be it on tit or dread
---
Tbf this idea is prob. 1000000 % better then the test one like couple minutes ago , 1 point I don’t like on it, this might be all good and fine for most situations but imaging bigger fights where even the tankiest ships wont last long , means half of your fleet is stuck and can’t react because they don’t have capacitor and the initial cYno died 
---
Then put the cyno offgrid and warp the fleet in. 
---
Wish granted. Let’s make it 50 instalocking podding rats.
---
first, please stop with this dumb remove local meme. it will kill nullsec faster than ccp can churn out another police skin and the only place you'll be able to kill krabs will be hisec mission hubs. second, all these "issues" are significant revenue generators for ccp. more toons (esp capital ones) means more subs and more extractors sold. safety means income for them, people will hoard throngs of characters and isk and ships to no end because this is human nature. i understand what ur saying and would like things to go the dangerous direction. it will not happen because it directly equates to them making less money.
---
Randomness of it would be the giveaway.
---
Thank you.
---
Just skill logi and be taken with a kiss on every fleet until you catch up on some of the dps ships if you like that better.
---
Well actually they won't drop 100 feroxes because they aren't just sitting next to a titan to bridge all day. The point is with current cynos all allied jump capable undocked ships within range can just immediately drop. This includes ratting supers which will destroy most small gangs with just a couple. Inb4 defang my NYX.
---
So they did not have to buy and maintain additional hardware. AWS is expensive but so are hardware racks.
---
&gt;  Though I don't think tether is all that relevant on moons. The range that neuts and ECM go out to on the other hand ..if we catch something on a moon we are fighting a structure too.
---
It's not the tether per se, indeed (they could dock immediately if they couldn't tether anyway), it's that a moon mining athanor is still a functional structure and you have to fight on its grid.
---
Either put the belt out of structure weapons range (500km?) or make it impossible to fit anything else on an athanor if you have a moon mining laser on it.
---
And having no local doesnt mean you will catch somebody who is prealigned (its highly unlikely, unless you bump).
---
100% drops from a citadel, pos is roll of the dice
---
good means has all pages and cover still attached, looks about right
---
We all believed the singularity would happen when bots surpassed human intelligence.
---
It turned out it was the humans who regressed to the intelligence of bots.
---
So you are saying that all this is for your sake because "You want"
---
With our current setup this is not possible due to several reasons (but this does not mean, that it is a bad idea and not worth to investigate further). In our past attempts to use virtualization we ended up with a quite reduced performance, so we are currently not using virtualization to run the game servers of Tranquility. The main benefit of a reinforcement request is also to separate the fight system from other systems on the same node (which share some resources together). This is easy during downtime, but with our current code later only possible by disconnecting all players in this system. 
---
Which resources are drained during a big fight: CPU of a single core and maybe memory bandwidth (not so sure about this one).
---
&gt;5 supers is good small gang content
---
Ok
---
&gt;Buff rorq mining boosts so the optimal way to mine becomes 1 rorq and a fleet of exhumers
---
Excuse me, sir,  but it sounds like you're trying to turn this into some kind of multiplayer game.
---
While you're at it, let's go back in time and change CCPs policy on using multiple accounts and multiboxing.
---
Yes sure antifa is all about being against neo nazis, they are total heroes. Nah mate it's just the commy version of skinheads.
---
Glad you put it in black and white btw, political violence is wrong no matter your conviction :)
---
Beat up the wrong thinkers! 
---
Just form more people
---
Loved Farscape
---
How about instead of that we make siege 30 seconds long.
---
Yay, someone ran with my idea!
---
I have no idea, but asset safety is one of those things I never expected would actually be implemented in this game, which is known for making you actually lose shit when you get blown up.  
---
Asset safety is a massive mistake (Amonst many, I suppose). I get that it makes it easier for people to leave their shit wherever when they can't play anymore, but honestly, that's *their* problem.
---
Fascinating argument. I applaud you.
---
Yeah, this is indeed difficult to answer. If you know the system, where the fight would be, and you made already preparations for the fight, then it is probably worth to send a request, even if the other side does not show up.
---
But yeah, sending too many requests could again lead to worse performance, if we are running out of dedicated nodes (although in some cases we can avoid this with manual intervention).
---
the influx of carebears might as well kill the game.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/amdld3/an_idea_to_help_balance_capital_ship_power/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
I just posted this idea I had as i woke up this morning.
---
Alright supercap blobs! Get your downvotes ready!
---
When the CSM proposed to CCP to add more fitting options to capitals and supercapitals (capital sized, plates, extenders, cap boosters, neuts, etc) they said it was because they wanted to fit their ships like other ships in the game. They argued that if the ships were able to be fit like subcaps then they would use them more, and therefore they would get in fights and die more often.
---
I will go officially on record and say: there is nothing wrong with that, and I think we all agree they are being used more. 
---
My argument is that if you want to be fit like a subcap, be used like a subcap, and fight like a subcap, then you need to travel New Eden like a subcap.
---
Here is the proposed changes:
---
Remove the Cynosural Module I.
---
Allow JFs to jump to covert beacons. 
---
Allow supers to jump through the new Ansible Jump Gates. 
---
Right there you fix like 90% of the problems with caps and supers. No more "get out of jail free" supercap/FAX umbrella, Rorquals PANIC will actually function like it was designed (give defense fleet 5 minutes to be on site), small groups can kill stuff, and large groups can still build the freedom to maneuver and defend their space with supers. Lowsec won't be endless cyno bait. Invasions will actually be difficult and matter. Dreadbombs will need to be brought in by gate, just like the defensive fleet.
---
Oh... I almost forgot. No more jump fatigue because there are no longer cynos to jump to. 
---
It will change Eve. No joke it will change Eve. A lot of people will not like it. However, it's really how supers and capital travel should be balanced compared to their power.
---
Well have u ever been part of a fight bigger then 150 people ? The Tidi be immense and it prob. Takes 10 mins to load system + bumps and bounces will prob. Delay your fleet by like 20-30 mins + the fighting grid will be bubble fucked as hell so u won’t be in range of your friends 
---
Oh I presumed his argument is a troll. 
---
A carrier fatter in me doesn’t like “nerf caps application to sub caps” point.
---
I do think that lighting a cyno outside of tether range should be an activity you have to defend.
---
Well if entities like goons and test and the north have at least 1 fax pilot each , how hard will it be for them to have a subcap alt or Main on standby on a titan .. it’s not the way atm but if it change pilot will adapt 
---
I mean if you decide not to read what I actually write and just invent your own version of English where you say the exact opposite of what is clearly written, then I guess, yeah. 
---
Wrong. As much as I hate that it was them, Goons decided they wanted to be a super power in this game and recognized that to build a super power you need a good foundation. And like it or not, ore is the foundation of everything in this game. They concentrated their people in Delve and pushed them to mine more and more. They put in the work to protect those miners with a supercap fleet. If rorquals didn't exist they would have done the same work with Orcas, Hulks, and capital freighters, and they would be just as far ahead of everyone.
---
Eventually others picked up on what they were doing and started pushing their own crabs. Careful planning and dedication is what has led to such an imbalance. Rorquals and injectors were just tools. Tools that are available to everyone. It;s like claiming a gun is overpowered because you only brought a knife to the fight. CCP can't balance the power of organizations. That is for the players to do.
---
If you truly feel the Rorqual is overpowered, bring one down to Provi and try to mine with it. I bet you never get the ore hold completely filled. Goons, Test, Pl/NC can rorqual mine all day long because they have the organizations to support such an endeavor, not because the ship is overpowered.
---
Just gonna point out that it isn't really vs Shoot First since no more than 3 or 4 of us arrived on grid (in cyno blew up mid bridge). Nice music though, what is it? Well played anyways. Hopefully we get to actually shoot each other properly next time.
---
How are the view angles for Netflix and chill kind of activities? I’m trying to choose a monitor and I’m stuck in analysis paralysis between IPS and quantum dot VA.
---
Then what I am suggesting in the main post doesnt matter much since the spool up time is 15 seconds in a system with no tidi and you would need to load the tidi system anyways if you are jumping in with my idea or not. Jumping out might not be as fun, but again, its not much worse than how it is now at max tidi. Why should capitals be allowed to leave a fight within a window of less than 15 seconds if they already committed to the fight? 
---
If its a moving op that got dropped, why arent you getting tethered or docking up? You wouldn't have the cap to jump out anyway and also have fatigue. 
---
Just one simple question:   
---
If stuff is "too hard to kill right now", then how do you explain the rise in total destruction month after month after month since the rorqual/alpha changes compared to prior levels (before Nov 2016)?  
---
How can it be the fundamental problem of not enough destruction when said destruction has risen in comparison to the aforementioned timeframe?
---
It must be covops and it must be fittable to something combat capable, so really a T3C is your only option. Maybe a Legion so you can use lasers and not have to worry about ammo.
---
Multiboxed spider monkey Nestors
---
Just go marketing? all you need to make a shit ton of isk. 
---
Yes ban most of your player base for grinding isk to afford pvp ships that sounds healthy for the game.
---
You know the game is tottaly shit when Qclick null monkeys ask for cap nerfs.
---
Lol a damnation fleet 
---
So, the entirety of the tenure of Eve Online, aside from a small slice of wormhole space, was a mistake? Because assets have *never* been at risk in a structure. Never ever. Hell, if anything, assets are *more* at risk now that you can get partial loot from Engineering Complexes and reactor-fit Refineries. 
---
i-it's wrong when they say it but not when we said it years ago
---
I hate to break it to you, but we already keep a significant force at home when we deploy, in the current meta. That shit's already done. There's a reason we tell our dudes to get two titans per character.
---
Always down for a good ole brawl with you guys, you know where to find us.

---
&gt; I thought about joining a wormhole corp but my schedule is so erratic with work and home im afraid to be a pain in the ass and unreliable
---
There's a lot of corps which don't require fixed schedules. As long as you're able to show up if something serious happens (like someone trying to evict you), most will be happy to have someone who's keen and fun to fly with when they're available.
---
There are. Incursions. But there is a reason most people don’t do them. They are boring and repetitive as hell, require the player to put significant assets at risk and they’re super easy to gank. The issue with organized PvE is that without a supercap umbrella you’re gonna have a hard time not getting hunted and killed. 
---
How does a command destroyer's MJD work? Can it jump a target that is being warp scrambled? Can it jump if it is being warp scrambled?
---
Well why don’t u bring enough people to actually Win the fight .. 
---
Ok your idea I can’t jump if my cYno is already destroyed , but I don’t have cap either to use another one , means everything gets delayed which can make a difference 
---
The main issue is , you try to only see your point of view , so you try to change the game to your advantage , so u can avoid to get countered , but in the bigger picture it will hurt the game 
---
Everyone starts out bad at this game. We improve through experience and losing ships.
---
Alright, so the rorqual gets nerfed into uselessness, just like your fantasies dictate. What happens then? Hint: we still got more supers than you. You're already too afraid to use what you got, with infinite* rorqual ore coming in. I'd recommend thinking at least one step beyond what you're asking for.
---
&gt; I require TEST to have 4 separate stagings with like 5 bil worth of ships
---
yeah, fuck that. that's completely unnecessary. I wouldn't be sinking that much isk in ships that'd barely see the light of day.
---
i have a fraction of that for our doctrines, and most of them still don't get undocked with any frequency.
---
It's in reference to the current sperg on reddit right now! but it's just all in good fun!

&gt;Remove asset safety.

---
You are acting like this was announced in an expansion patch note blog.... This was an idea I had thats up for iteration and improvement. Not everything is a yes or no answer... There is a solution to just about everything, but its never a perfect solution. 
---
I think its pretty mature to talk about your mistakes and how you learned from them actually. More so than publicly crying about how the game needs to be materially altered to paper over your own deficiencies.
---
r/masterhacker
---
No and no. 
---
Specifically, it takes 5 seconds to cycle (or 'spool up') with good skills. When it starts spooling up, you lose directional control of your ship - it starts going whatever way it was pointing at the time at max speed (unless you previously set that speed to less than max). If you get scrammed or die at any point during the spool up, it simply doesn't trigger (no ships are jumped), and you get the full cooldown. You also get an aggression timer as soon as you start spooling. You get a massive sig bloom as well for the duration of the cycle, which stacks (additively) with the MWD sig bloom. 
---
If you make it through the spool up without getting scrammed, you and any ships in a 6km radius around you are teleported (or 'booshed') 100km in the direction your command destroyer is pointing (it doesn't matter where the other ships were pointing). If any of them are scrammed at the moment the cycle ends, they stay where they were. Allies, foes, drones and such (even missiles and bombs) are all booshed (there is no way to 'opt out' except by getting scrammed or flying out of range). 
---
Capitals, ships with active cynos, freighters, anchored structures such as mobile depots are all unaffected by the boosh. 
---
No but everytime people try to change capital ships or cynos it is because they lost of it against one of the major superumbrellas but their solutions and changes effect everyone not only those ..
---
Well it is shit to lose against a super umbrella but it happened it’s shit to lose a VNI to a kitchen sink fleet aswell, just thoses don’t try to change everything to their advantage afterwards 
---
Then SOMEONE really really really owes me 60 bill they took from my wallet for no damn reason. Yes, I had a CYNO toon in the eve casino corporation that had NOT YET developed their platform.
---
&gt;  I have to travel my carrier or dread 300 jumps
---
Don't be poor, carriers and dreads are cheap...
---
&gt; just roll their static to get rescuing withing minutes 
---
uhm no, we can't roll for a specific hole, we rage and hope we get lucky, it *could* take minutes, more likely hours
---
Yes its amazing, hop in!
---
Remember when you could buy a 60 day gtc from markee dragon and get a 1B isk credit to blink? Those were the days.
---
&gt;Structures have ridiculously long reinforcement stages which makes it a significant time investment to do things.
---
I'd add to that: structures have more than 1 timer, so defender has to win only once, while attacker has to win all rounds.
---
Nobody ever comes to defend on first rf. Attacker has to go all in (structure won't rf itself duh).
---
It's also often customary to skip/blueball second timer as well. Attacker still has to go all in, because if you half-ass it, you might get overwhelmed.
---
why atlantis though? You've got an off-worlder girl who didn't really have any personality, who they tried to compliment with another off-worlder, who's personality can be summed up by "it's a ~~jaffa~~ revenge thing". The leader is kinda generic too, though at least makes decent decisions for the most part. The only person with unique personality is the science guy, everyone else just feels like slight variation of SG1.
---
I have fond memories of SGU, but i'm about a month away from rewatching that, so I may just be remembering a rose-tinted version.
---
What I find hilarious is the fact that the loss of a T3C, a ship that is considered "blingy" at 4-5 bill, is reason for a serious SP loss, while cap and super losses, ships considered "shit-fit" / "poor-fit",  at 4-5 bill, or even their hulls cost more, cause no SP losses.
---
Also, I don't get why a Rorq is allowed to activate a cyno and its PANIC module at the same time. It should be either or, invulnerability or fast reinforcements. My impression always was that, in EVE, you can't have your pie and eat it too.
---
A little inconsistent there, aren't we, CCP?

I hope you're not serious.

I havent lost a capital in a very long time, or if I have lost one recently, I dont remember or care. I'm not some bitter cap pilot that just lost some ship and now I want to change the game.

I am a vet player who wants to see this game become fun again like it used to be. Its kinda sad when people are using capital fleets as their standing response fleets, and drop on small gangs that are going after VNIs or some other small shit.

Tranquility is quickly turning into what Serenity was for years.

Why aren't you already going after every pinata in w-space? Too much effort?

I'd say it is still needs to be done. I dunno, maybe do a gradation, 50% safety in hisec, 25% in low, 0 in null/wh. Get the stakes back to the game

Haha fking nice dude! Isn't it a good feeling when you pop them, then just ouruze cruise away?

Jajaja don’t be poor bla bla bla that’s just an example if if I want to my faction super titan it’s just a pain in the ass +  what’s the point of having a Jump capable ship that can’t jump anymore. but no u don’t need to role your nullsec/lowsec static to get another region ? No?

CCPlz why won't you make it easier for these poor whiny souls to kill whatever they want wherever they want at any time :(
---
Sorry your shit 😐

I'm quickly finding this guy is the kind of person who wants the perfect answer to a specific scenario that he may find himself in.

I'm new to the game, how much bots are a problem ?

Are there unstoppable armies of bots that have control over some territories ? 
---
Moving to the cloud is great, long term savings are significant and reliability is typically better.

Well if I want to defend something I make sure I win , what’s the point of giving the attacker a fight if I don’t want them to come back ? Oo

It’s no like everyone is waiting for your roaming gang to appear to get a fight

Please let me know where. I'll come visit in a cata. Will bring booze!

Anyway a man can dream.

CCP has no balls to go back on their bad design decision, gotta keep those subs (and i'm pretty sure around half of them are bots nowadays)

Not at all, I'm saying that that OP does not take the counter to the counter in account. Contrary to what was the comment i replied to suggested.

Nah mate, I work 40h/week and intend on keeping it up. It's gonna be extramunal studies :p

Maybe worrying to you. Even if you're on the level, and I doubt it, I think it's awesome and it appears I'm not alone. Sorry again about your spendy ship but if you're looking for sympathy you are in for a dose of reality.
---
Well why would they give u a fight , you go with a small gang after ratter and miner and they kill u with caps where is the difference in the end ?u kill shit that isn’t able to defend themselfs against u and the do the same to u?
---
he had a family (of spicy chicken wings)
---
Actually , Brave has capitals sitting and waiting for a roaming gang in their standing fleet... So yeah, thats a thing... Also, you have to consider a balanced approach, not the 'I want changes that guarantee me to win every fight I pick' approach. Thats not how life works.
---
Hell, we have FC ships in eve now, why not a Cyno ship to go along with a change like my suggestion? Give it a really strong tank on a cruiser hull, you gotta have cyno 5, and all ita good for is to show up and light a cyno and not die as fast. 
---
Ooh, or how about brick tanking a HAC for a cyno, and using the assault damage control to make it borderline unkillable for the 15 seconds needed? 
---
There are solutions outside a generic thought process. 
---
Good luck in life sir.
---
you take that back
---
Get vaccinated please
---
Well do u really think a brick tanked hay with assault damage control with last against 200 bs when can easily alpha active tanked faxes ? 
---
Im not totally against your idea delaying the cYno , I just think 15secs is a very long time especially in big fights were most stuff gets alpha‘d.
---
Most solutions support small gangs but not the bigger picture 
---
Dude, this sub has *eve players*. So I'm not sure what you were thinking people here would react like; give you sympathy? Rally in support? Petition ccp? 
---
Instead it's obvious that you're only going to get mocked.
---
Seriously what were you expecting would happen?
---
"There's just more of them now" is an interesting way to hand wave away the wild supercap proliferation we're seeing
---
keep digging
---
The issue isn't that CCP can't make more engaging PVE. They have. It's just that they haven't re-addressed old PVE, and it generally isn't worth giving up on it for the new, engaging stuff when you're already set up to do the old stuff in the background while you also have fun watching netflix or chatting on comms or playing a Xth account in a gate camp or whatever.
---
Anoms can stay how they are, mechanically, as far as I'm concerned... so long as the bounties are nerfed or the respawns are lengthened so that they aren't the "best" option for anyone who can tolerate them. They're too lucrative relative to highsec incursions (group effort, some level of coordination, risk of mistakes or ganks of expensive ships) or WHs (more risk, more logistics, more interesting PVE) or abyssal (more risk, more interesting PVE, frigate abyssals require coordination (usually)), etc. If anoms got nerfbatted and CCP addressed some simple concerns with FW and FW missions, I think the whole ratting ecosystem in Eve would be 200% better.
---
I would base it around ADM activity.  If you activity increases at 3am eve time then the window is around then.  I have personally experience being TZ tanked by people who were active the same time as me... If you want to TZ tank me .. fair enough but you will have to get up in the middle of the night to rat.
---
removing PANIC would mean that a dread bomb can kill the rorq before supers get on grid.
---
&gt; Dreadbombs will need to be brought in by gate
---
I don't think you realise what a massive advantage this is for the defending side. A number of well placed bubbles would make effective deployment of dreads impossible. A few decently placed defending long range dread/titans off the gate would stop any attempt of a dreadbomb in it's tracks  
---
Fewer fights would happen, because attackers would need overwhelming odds to make it trough the gate to the target. People will choose not to fight instead of landing on grid with whatever made it trough the meatgrinder.   
---
Dammit... I won Eve a few years ago, but I want to rewatch Stargate and it'd be so easy to get back into Eve while I'm binge watching it.
---
I'm not convinced he Is retarded. Lets put a scratch-n-sniff sticker on the bottom of the pool and find out. :)
---
I mean that would be assuming they instantly bash it when you go afk and how much do you realistically have stored in the staging? 
---
You could always keep enough for fleets and keep the rest atleast a mid out so its barely any time to move the front if needed and won't be  gone instantly :shrug:
---
Think about the time needed for someone to see the cyno, register which ship is the one lighting the cyno, giving the broadcast to lock it up, time to actually lock it up, and hope that your guns arent in the middle of a cycle so you can get on it quick. 
---
That all happens fast, but by the time it is all done, that 15 seconds is probably about up. Most capital fleets click jump as soon as the cyno is available. I dont think 15 seconds is too much. 
---
What piñatas? J-space residents have never had asset safety. Thus, they keep their loafers light. (Hard Knocks got the hubris and was an exception to this.)
---
The funny thing is, if no asset safety came to k-space, we'd do the same thing. The handsome and intelligent person who chose Delve as Goonswarm Federation's home took into account a possible future where asset safety was removed in a horrid kneejerk, and we find ourselves with centrally-located NPC space with which to store our assets. Funny, that.
---
Asset safety is, first and foremost, a *compromise.* For all the shit y'all give CCP, they understand one thing perfectly well -- players will engage in tedium bordering on self-harm to mitigate risk. So, rather than all but require players to engage in meaningless asset jenga to mitigate risk, they put in asset safety.
---
Given he wins only with THE biggest blob backing him, effectively, he's one of the main FC of the biggest blob.
---
injectors makes it increase exponentially, instead of having an alt that trains for 1,5 years without doing anything, you have a rorq day one, that easily makes back what you injected it with in that timeframe.
---
When you have injected it, its also a free omega, you just turn it in to a skillfarm, which you couldn't do before. 
---
 If you doesn't understand that you should redo maths
---
No problem. I'm certainly not creative nor ambitious enough to do something like this myself, but once in a while I wish one of my ideas would come to life anyway. Lol.
---
I'm sure an extended version all the way up to PA "King Arthur" knighting CCP while talking about skin sale numbers would be welcome on the sub too ;)
---
It is not like you can choose to engage right?
---
Its about fun not who has the biggest dick
---
You used to atleast be able to deny them access before citadels being added for as long as you held the space. Now they just go back to where they can be cheaply moved back after a short period.
---
You weren't at risk of the assets dropping before but atleast you could be denied them. iirc didn't PL even pay goons after B-R to move assets they had trapped there? Something which we wouldn't see today.
---
Oh, I didn't know we were discussing my life. I thought we were discussing your hilarious ship loss in a video game and how delicious your salty "everyone is wrong but me" tears are.
---
IWI was imply in a dirty RMT network and the casino who create ~~casino war~~ World War Bee just blown up eve nullsec economy, imagine if a few player get hundred of billion every day by not playing the game but just running a casino out of the game.. It's like having rorqual, but 10x the isk/hour and no one can hit it.. The timing where all of that happen was during the Cs:go casino shitstorm so they might saw a shit storm coming to them (even if EVE Online is an unknow game and would never had the attention CS:GO had..)  CCP mixed those thing and took down Casino for ever, along side banning/locking assets from the IWI bankers involved in the dirty RMT network (hey lenny).
---
I'm in the same boat
---
No1 drove you away. You got kicked out right after WWB, then got kicked around when you thought you could farm Geminate. Now you're getting your butts kicked in Perimeter and complaining about NC.
---
If rorq panic gets removed, so should void bombs. You can not require a guy to invest 10 billion isk,  sit still, not be able to move and take away his ability to fight back or tank, and not receive outside reps. Well you can, but it will cause rorqs to not be used.
---
And yet, that's not the same thing as no asset safety, now, is it? What you want is for assets to be *lootable.* That shit has never happened; don't pretend like it has ever been the case.
---
How does a gtfo prevent that over, say, sig tanking being gutted so hard a ferox tracks everything 
---
i dunno about you but having the biggest dick is a lot of fun for me
---
I think CCP should add a structure that fit in a ceptor, with a small anchored time, let's say 1 min, and once fully deploy, no one can light a cyno. so if you are not bad, you can deny any super/titan coming to help the shit you are targeting, using logi ships to keep the structure alive and it's "free" kill for any small/medium size gang well prepared.
---
Oh wait it's already in game but no one use them properly they prefer crying on reddit "muuuuh need balance"
---
We were talking the general use of them, you keep nitpicking shit to fit your narrative. Of course it boils down to the situation. The point is that you have to choose on the spot while eating losses. Ravens or rokhs can disengage and move around at will, your capitals not. Having to switch from ravens back to shooting capitals takes time which can be vital. Just like the tanked Titan of Sort that tanked while 3 PL titans died. 
---
I hope you understand what I mean.
---
I think they're shy on balancing stuff because the game is so interconnected, and the ultimate effects of the changes take a while to manifest.
---
&gt; biggest *metaphorical dick
---
Titans dont make your wang any bigger irl
---
&gt; This would give the about-to-be-fucked party to react to the cyno, and if the cyno dies in the period if time, the jump is cancelled and you dont get the capacitor back.
---
Better, every time someone light a cyno, CCP should add an auto-warp out because a titan landing, targeting/firing his DD is too fast for any small/medium size gang player, because they are leet.
---
Not bad for a used book if the binding is intact. Good find!
---
¿Por qué no los dos?
---
Because then that noob plays eve expecting people to replace his loss and cater to him instead of learning the hard way.
---
The best lessons are learned through trial. Sure the OP may know what he can do to prevent a death next time, but the next time he happens to get caught and doesn’t get 20m thrown at him... then what?
---
Imagine null being so dead you have to go to highsec to pvp
---
That’s really a lot of words to show that you have no idea whatsoever of what you’re talking about. I bet you’ve nerf even flown a hic. 
---
Because they are like cars, how else will you compensate? :)
---
I would like to subscribe to your newsletter
---
&gt;you can't break supercaps with fax support when fielding only subcaps without 4 times the numbers. so give subs a buff relative to super, that automatically decreases the umbrella safety which also indirectly nerfs rorq safety
---
Most Sub cap gangs that hunt ratters/miners are not a CTA sized fleet, they are small skirmish gangs.   Balancing the game to allow a small roaming gang to be able to kill/ignore Supers/titans will break the game when you have taperium currently with 50k pilots.   
---
I personally think a rorq in panic should not be able to have a cyno lit,  you light a cyno and your Panic will not work until the cyno goes down, an invulnerable cyno is broken.    
---
Cyno prohibiting panic will force the Rorq into having to use it's head, light a cyno for supers to come in and not panic or panic and make supers come in from another cyno or gate of which can be countered by killing the cyno, bubbling towards the offgrid cyno/gate etc.    
---
Give HIC ADC lul
---
Well, to start with it's more fair to be saying that you're risking ~2b isk, not 10b isk given the fact you can depot your excavators if you're paying attention. 
---
Second, I'd say it's hardly like they can't tank at all, they have stupid tank still even though they require injectors to deal with neut pressure (either via neuts or void bombs). 
---
Thirdly, I'd say they are mining ships. You put them in the field to make isk, and you risk them to make isk. There is zero chance that if panic was removed that rorqs still wouldn't be widely used. The acceptance of making eve more dangerous is the fact that more stuff will die. 
---
Want lots of rorqs out? Cool, defend them. This is (was?) EVE. 
---
Could work 
---
Ty :)
---
This is going to sound counter-intuitive, but after 6 years of Eve, high sec is the scariest place.  I've lost more in high sec than I ever have in wormholes.    
---
When a rorq gets caught. They have to use capacitor to tank now. Even with two cap injectors it's almost impossible to tank. Go watch some bombers bar videos. You will see how fast they melt now being nueted. 10 billion because the drones, the ship, and the fit. 
---
If you enter a long warp and a fleet jumps in before you land you don't have to set down a wetu. You can pick one up after you click warp. If you landed and set one down, doctor jumps in and bundles you, it can kill your wetu before it anchors. 
---
You seem to know nothing of the mechanics. So please, either go away or learn them. 
---
Oh shit ive been watching sg1 too. Nice to see fellow fans
---
Give them the best experience by holding them with your entire corp and have them write a poem in local to be set free, then shower them in isk of course.
---
Why is the Proteus considered so bad?
---
How are you watching farscape? 
---
Viewing angles are great, but i wouldn't us it to watch netflix, you los half the screen to black bars (although that said it does support 2 inputs, so you could split the screen in two and watch two things at once). Basically its just an impractical toy for gaming haha
---
I just think there should be more consequences for losing your space. It's the reason why I live in wspace I'm not saying I think it was perfect I still thought there should of been more consequences back then sov but there is even less now it's kinda a joke.
---
A "hardcore mmo" where any suggestion to make there be actual risks everyone starts screaming about how there shouldn't be any lmao.
---
Nice job!
---
You need a large number of paints for the titans to apply with LR guns. We learned this testing for the tri keepstar defense. After a few hours of testing on sisi, without a 4+ paints, even at range the battleships were able to easily sig tank.  
---
Idk about them killing fax fast enough, you’d need a lot of ravens. 
---
I'm well aware of the mechanics. I do fly rorq's myself. So now we're getting down to the specific scenario of being caught in warp in the 60 seconds before the Wetu's anchors? And you're trying to tank a bombers bar fleet of say 50-60 bombers? 
---
Well yes, in that case you will die, you will lose ~10b isk. Can you tell me why you *shouldn't* though?
---
You know he wrote that just to get more ppl to watch his twitch stream
---
Just get a rorq alt /s
---
He is set back 20m? Which is a big sum when you are starting out. Sure, only fly what you can afford to loose yada yada. But can you really expect someone that is playing for a week to follow that?  How is he even gonna do that? In my first to weeks I had about 10mil on hand, the rest was bound up in a venture, and my mission running thorax (don't ask). When I got blown out of the venture and later the thorax, I just quit the game for a few months. There are also things you will probably not learn by trial. Example 1: My mission running Thorax ; Example 2: My mission running Brutix ; Example 3: My mission running Mega. All of which with railguns and Iron ammo. All of which with cap rechargers out the ass. All of which with horrible mission clearing times. All of which eventually died horribly to a gank. Nobody told me why they sucked. I wished somebody had at least done that. When I eventually figured out how to actually fit the fucking ships I was flying, my own train of thought that led me to my old fits was only barely comprehensible to me.
---
TL;DR : If you blow a noob out of his ship, he will likely learn little if you don't tell him why you did. And they will get really frustrated because they quite possibly lost a big part of their assets.
---
What is this war about? 
---
Like when everyone said rorq changes would introduce a giant capital meta and now everyone has a super or titan. *Shocked pikachu face*
---
Depends on how you think it about, really. Yes, there are tons of bots all over the game. A big problem I see is that there is already a decent chunk of the player base uses them, every big alliance has some form of botting, whether or not they know about it or turn a blind eye is a different story.    
---
          
---
     
---
Go try and buy something in a market hub, 9/10 times when you buy it, a bot has already put another sell order before your market can even refresh. If you roam thru null, and you use wormholes (not setting off their near2 program) you can catch some but the ones you catch are most likely afk. This is because the bots have such a quick reaction to someone entering local, that you even with a hyperspatial jackdaw, can't get on the grid before they warp out. There are even people botting data and relic sites.     
---
It's annoying in my opinion, everyone is doing things the regular way, and these cunts are making big money being 100% afk.      
---
      
---
And to be totally candid with you, I think that we just have to contend with the fact that bots are here to stay sadly. Look at how they ban for example. You could easily track down who the owner of a bot is, but they don't. You can add an anti-cheat software, to look for suspicious movements (i believe many bots move the cursor on the x or y-axis only) literally every other game has one but they don't. Maybe they are thinking of shareholders only and see that their bottom line gets boosted pretty well when they do a ban wave. Anyone with half a braincell is going to either stay away from the game or eventually quit. The sad thing is I've had a few people in recent times quit the game because they felt like it was futile to do anything effectively because bots just ruin his fun gameplay (market bots in this anecdotal case)
---
So the loss of your farm lands, tens of trillions of ISK of infrastructure, and all of your income isn't enough consequence? Spaceships aren't the only thing in this game, you know.
---
Can you just reinforce it for the next year? Its gonna be a hotspot for a while.
---
What you described is exactly how I learned and why I have played for 7 years. The resources available for new players to learn is abundant. Everything has been min-maxed and theory crafted to perfection. There are even guides, fits, and everything for newer / lower SP characters to utilize.
---
What I’m saying is that Eve Online can be a difficult game and if you quit because you lose a few ships while learning, then the game probably isn’t for you and that’s alright... this game isn’t for everyone. I’m not against counseling a newer player on what they did wrong and how they can be better... that’s what we should be doing. Throwing isk at every loss they have is something that I don’t think is necessary to their learning or continuing the game. 
---
GIVE HIC AN AEON EHP AND A TITAN DD OR ITS UNFAIR CCP
---
Time to spend some of that dank pearl abys isk
---
If they're already pounding on someone it's the best time to hit that gate. They aren't worried about you.
---
Have fun in wormholes, they are super cool. Make sure you read up on the sites in there before you go messing about in them, the rats are incredibly powerful. Also, DO NOT FORGET to bookmark the wormholes you travel through if you intend to come back the way you came. There is no better way to practice and understand scanning than wormholes.
---
How do the Gila and VNI compare for ratting? Is either a viable PVP ship?
---
Bro I linked this in an incursion fleet when everyone was celebrating about a dude upgrading from a Rokh.
---
Who lost all their income the north? I can't name any group recently that lost their income unless the group actually died most just move across the universe and start over like normal where the cost to line members is more minimal then ever with asset safety it's not even trapped in the stations you lost.
---
Man, I miss this game. 
---
Holy shit dude, make your drone window larger!
---
You give them too much credit.
---
More like 2023 - 2nd decade of EVE 
---
We lost all of our income when we were evicted from the North in 2016. Losing space means losing your income, both as an alliance and for line members who rely on the space to make the money. You know, that thing people do with rorquals and hels/nyxen that everyone seems so upset about. That's a consequence, and it's much more relevant than little Timmy losing his Drake because his structure got blown up.
---
Again, there's more to the game than spaceships. Quit fixating on them.
---
Can you point to some examples? What‘s a good example of CCP experimenting with engaging PVE in the past?
---
And you could very easily do the same to the defending force. Preparation, planning, and leadership will win the day.
---
True
---
This also doesn't affect balance. It's just timing. Even as a noob I can see this.
---
I did eventually come back. And in large part because I learned of all the stuff available to new guys. But it would have been a lot easier if I got started (again) with more than 5 mil in the bank. And I completely agree with you that the most effective tool to teach somebody something, is a fiery death at the hands of a ship half their size. I just like to follow that up with a donation and a Join Horde! Most guys listen to you a lot more if they don't perceive you as the bad guy.
---
It does tho. 
---
When you can literally press pause on incomming DPS, its a balance issue. 
---
Hics should get isk field generators so people within yhe isk bubble get iskies. 
---
Anyone can do this anyway, without skill injectors. The issue is then with Rorquals, \_not\_ injectors. It's just pushing the problem around. That's extremely obvious.
---
I agree with that. I’m of the opinion that CCP is their own worst enemy when it comes to player retention and new players joining. It’s not wardecs, ganking, botting, or any multitude of excuses that players make for why the game is in decline or why new players don’t stick it out. I believe it’s because CCP has little reason for players to start playing in the first place. The vastness of New Eden and the innocence of being new may be enough at first, but when you start getting into it.. the game is pretty trash :)  
---
that doesn't stop me needing to move a bunch of ships to places i have little interest in having them, does it?
---
I've been playing eve since... Forever..
---
The safety nets increased.
---
The loss potential decreased.
---
The way ease to obtain resources decreased.
---
Result:
---
Megacyte at 500 and corporate lifestyle pvp blobs.
---
But remember, you are here forever ;)
---
I like this. It’s simple and adds an actual level of intelligence needed. Only issue is if you have multiple rorqs and only one panics, you’ve got a few other ships all cyno capable 
---
no. 
---
The issue is the combination of Excavators, Skill injectors and PANIC
---
Ah it wouldn't be eve without a cunt chiming in! Thanks buddies I totally needed the snide comment at the end! 
---
what
---
Another frustrated mukkboy post.
---
This is a false statement because you haven't accounted for multi boxing. The amount of accounts logged in is the same but the real player count is dropping.
---
Its random. Besides 1h per day is way too little.
---
Nah but legit, good luck.
---
Haha yeah. I’ve actually been “winning Eve” for a few months now. The combined blows of CCPs lagging behind changes that need to be done, more safety than ever, and a seemingly smaller playerbase has me uninterested but wanting so bad for all that to change.
---
I think if I were to actually join a group where I had a sense of pride in them and cared about the successes and failures it wouldn’t be so bad... but meh.
---
I’m one of the “bad guys” that everyone rejoices when they leave eve :)
---
Brave Sir Robin.
---
The GM was technically correct, but to save you possible future headache, this probably wouldn't have saved you.  E-Warps are not 1m km straight forward;  the game picks a random direction, which your ship then has to align to... something a bumper would prevent just as when you were online.
---
More importantly however, combat timers can both start while you're offline but in space, and be extended, and when you log off to try to prevent a gank, you leave local.  Even semi-competent gankers will notice you're no longer in local, realize you're trying to safe log, and suicide gank you with an ibis or something to give you a timer.
---
Your best bet to avoid suicide ganks is to not fly expensive (really do this one), bring a friend to web you, or hope the ganker fucks up a bump by helping you align to a celestial or bookmark, then swapping your warp to that target.  Alignment requires your velocity vector be within 15 degrees of your destination IIRC.  It's fairly forgiving.
---
Well, thank you, we can all use a little luck in life. Have a wonderful day!
---
It's a good way to learn but it comes with drawbacks. Honestly if you pick amarr/caldari you're probably fine with standings because who the fuck goes to gallente or minmatar high-sec? It sucks. If you want to learn pvp tryjoining a fw corp, many are more than happy to help newbros.
---
For hauling from jita to lowsec I recommend using ghsol , they work with few major alliances, and is an alternative. 
---
That was fucking hillarous. Good job to EveOnion.
---
He’s a Eve news reporter ! Think of him as j ,, j ,,, jer,,, jimmy from South Park 
---
Better to remove extractors from shop
---
Will never happen, PA / CCP are after the big money
---
Sure, but what i'm saying is that even the most organised and motivated entities in the game will mount fewer attacks due to the increased difficulty of mounting a successful attack. Especially because defending will simply be easier with your plan.  
---
We will have fewer fights in total, which is not what EVE needs.
---
I was also amazed at amount of access given to the corp that recruited me (new player). How do you revoke access? Thx 
---
Link km?
---
You've got quite the EM hole there bud, Blood Raiders are EM based for damage.

You've just spent far too much time crabbing, and now the crabs are rising up to fight their nullsec oppressors.

Make Hics Invul against damage when targeted by fighters .. ccpls 
---
What is "Triage"?
---
oh didnt die today just a normal everyday tough for anyone going trough tama
---
I heard this complaint several times in the past years. Didnt CCP Seagull promise a dedicated balance team and faster balance changes like 2 years ago? What happened to that?
---
This depends on how you balance it. 
---
20-40man: If super/cap dmg on subs become neglectable, well then you have to disengage as soon as caps are dropped, but at least you CAN disengage. Look for another target, and eventually you find a suitable target with caps enough caps on red timers. a 30man bomber fleet can do this quite well
---
small gang (&lt;10): sorry, if you can easily kill a decently tanked rorq, on their own turf and support, the game is not balanced again... just in the other direction. look for targets that match your capabilities, prepared rorqs have no real offensive except for support, but their defensive on the other hand can and should be quite good.
---
large fleet (bombersbar, 100+): with nerfed caps, and maybe more specialized anti cap weapons, these groups should be able to hold against caps more or less. of course they should bleed ship, but also have a chance to take quite some caps with them. as they are optimized for the sole purpose of hunting caps
---
Important here is, that if this is balanced okeyish, it will automatically adjust a bit for smaller groups. As it's more dangerous for caps to engage in a small gang, because they cannot disengage fast enough, so traps are becoming alot more effective. And 100 man fleets are assembled and run through WHs fast enough that this is an actual danger with every engagement.
---
CTA fleets (250+): This needs specific balancing, ofc. 
---
I would always say, that you should NEVER overbalance, because that always risks that you just invalidate stuff ppl worked for, for a long time. So: not Rorq balance AND cap balance AND anti cap ships etc. Rather make it step by step. Noone with a clear mind will doubt that a cap balance will have no impact on rorq safety, so why not just try that...
---
you are a moron
---
\#MEDA , i like it.
---
except for:
---
&gt; Nerf capital application against subcaps, etc. 
---
no, you just said MEDA....that goes for your kitey shit too. (found the lowsec kiter)

imagine having this many terrible opinions in that short of a post

WORST IDEA EVER, POST FAIL

&gt;*** - XIX really good now, they grew up since we kicked them from Drones, and now we can't fuck them alone at the moment. Scouge. not so good as we expected. We dont asked come FRAT to that timer it were Scourge idea. We dont take fun with it.
---
&gt;And i can understand Russians. why they named Scourge "faggots", i saw 3 or 4 BR Scourge against XIX/RZR and cant call them really good in pvp.
---
hahahahahahahahahahahahahaahaha ok dude
---
Null is a dangerous scary place and only the bravest toons should venture there..
---
Alternatively:
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/CrowdedUninterestedInternPJSalt
---
Streaming ratting (daily) in his titan.  Knowing that the defence fleet will provide instant FAX reps and the chance of a suicide dread bomb killing him being remote.  I honestly don't get why if you want to rat in Null why you would join anyone but goons.. it's like porsche "accept no substitute" for safety.
---
((I in no way begrudge goons for there methodological precision of taking full advantage of the current game mechanics.. Amazing organisation.  I am annoyed at CCP for allowing such game mechanics in the first place)).   
---
THIS MAN GETS IT. 
---
Triage is a module used by old carriers "Triage carriers" and FAX.
---
It's basically like siege for dreads, but instead of increasing your DPS it increases your healing. It does a bunch of other stuff to protect your ship as well. If you're interested "Triage Module" in game. 
---
Also, others EVE books from this shop marked are "very good".
---
"The burning life" seems really very good condition. :)
---
Hope its will be interesting.
---
WHAT?
---
&gt; The best counter to titans is to just not engage them.  
---
K. 
---
no it's not. its a linear increase of an exponential curve. that is not the same thing. Rich eve players were always eligible to earn more wealth than poor eve players, it just goes faster now. 
---
Also the wealth of being an "older" eve player is now buyable with isk, which is again buyable with simply playing the game. Rather than just wait.
---
BTW, if it was really exponential, why don't goons have 4000 titans yet? they definitely got the isk and the minerals... The argument of skillinjectors broke the game is just lame and is simply without a logical causality.
---
Both Gila and VNI can be pretty oppressive in PvP if you field them in a fleet or as fleet dps-support.
---
Gila got a huge bonus to damage and since it buffs medium drones the application is quite well for any shiptype, so you need no speed modules or tracking for drones and can go fulltank in mids. That makes a Gila superior to VNI if you look at new players since they got higher basedamage and benefits.
---
VNI uses heavys and needs come tracking / navigation computers to apply in PvE against small stuff. Armortanked with Neuts its the better PvP ship, I'd guess.  
---
Gila does not necessarily lead to Rattlesnek since they use different Weaponsystems and Drones, sure you can level Drone-assistance skills but need to invest into Sentrys and Heavys seperately. Also you need Cruise or Heavy Missile() skills wich see no use on a Gila.  
---
So there is no real connection besides shieldtank and general drone stuff.  
---
Beginners might be better of with a Gila since it has was better dronespeed, application and damage for less skillpoints involved. If you can upgrade to Omega and get some skills required for T2 you can consider VNI but those ships are usually throw away and not fit for different combatstyles where you need to tank *harder*.
---
you sure? even with boosts? It's too high for sure, and it should be lowered. I think it could be lowered to the level of a hulk, or maybe a little above, because it's much more passive than a hulk. Which makes hulks only limited multiboxable while rorqs can be endlessly multiboxed (while not attacked)
---
I don't have a rorq myself, so I had to look it up on someone elses calculation. Because with all the boosts, implants etc I simply fail to do it myself XD
---
I can't believe im in a alliance with retards like you this whole comment is saying "it's ok for rorqs to be immune to a whole fleet long enough for my alliances capital defense to drop" it's literally a 4b mining structure it shouldn't have a panic module
---

I know im in the unpopular opinion minority, but i actually really liked SGU. its the stargate "universe" where the goodguys dont always win, and escaping by the skin of your teeth becomes "so close, yet so far" instead.
---
Ships are already available on playing cards, on drive thru cards.
---
Ah so to confirm, we shouldn't make changes to local because then everyone and their mother is going to setup elaborate bot-based "defense camps" so it's totally not worth it all then? 
---
This is such a defeatist attitude. Even if you were able to prevent 5% of botters from pursuing it due to complication/cost, then it's worth it, period. That is, assuming you actually WANT to get rid of botting. This mentality that if we can't fix all botting in one fell swoop is so overused.
---
lmao wtf is this disinfo ? babbys xix first steps at reddit propaganda?

not if that's what I was doing in the past and getting consistent sites

Problem is a computer would rely on a pattern to create that randomization. That pattern can be detected. It can't possibly match the normal, yet randomly complex movements a normal human would make. A pattern from a real human would look more like a snowflake to whatever analysis system they were using. 
---
Unique, random, but no patterns.
---
no it's not. and noone ever made a clear causality chain why injectors broke the game. If you want to try, just do it.
---
I love how 95% of the ppl are simply stupid, cry to ccp that they should change something in a certain way. And then, when they get it, they cry again because it broke something while not solving the problem they had in mind...
---

You mean the time where our coalition was fractured and we lost a supercap superiority we didn't even have in the first place?
---
Besides, if we had supercap superiority then, why all the rorqual angst now? I thought the whole point of rorquals being evil was the fact that it let us catch up and lap you guys.
---
&gt; With skill injectors it's trivial to bypass the historical restriction (time) leading to the proliferation of high SP ships (supers, titans, etc). 
---
In a game like eve, with a running time of more than 15yrs and a time based training, it is trivial to give newer players a catch-up mechanic. This is actually crucial for the balance between newer and older players, and eve is in dire need of new players
---
It's awesome that you're trying to create some propaganda, but I'm afraid a lot of it got lost in the translation. You could've posted the russian version of this as well so that we might have a chance to decipher what this means.
---
I love nightmares

I think another thing in the era of easy cheap Rorq minerals is that caps just need to be adjusted to cost a hell of a lot more to build then. Over the last few years this parity has been lost in that caps *should be expensive as fuck*, and they arn't anymore relative to the kind of isk and mineral end-game players can pull in.

The Tengu is PvP fit, so if you do find a Gila or sonething running a site, you can kill it. But also has the ability to do C3 sites. I fucked up in the video, as you will see, I turned my Booster off, but that is the hardest site in a C3 and it does it with relative ease.
---
If all you want to do is run sites and no PvP get rid of the scram for another shield mod or something. Hope this helps.

Also sp loss on death in a cap/ super. Or remove sp loss from t3c

For problem 3, how is this different than subcap fights? Genuinly curious, as I’ve never FCed, but is there more to subcap fights beyond just a pure numbers game? Like to maneuvering your fleet well make a huge difference?

There’s actually no point in having these kind of discussions on reddit - it always ends up in a circlejerk of reee troll posts and insults rather than any rational counter arguments.

Gj removing your other dimwitted comment

what makes you think human have no pattern ? What makes you think bots can't create each their own pattern ? It already exists and is called a "seed". Typically you use entropy generators to gather random numbers (eg the ns value of the last non-clock interrupt), and you create a series of pseudo-numbers from one random number.

Sounds a little bit like the sleeper catche sites.  Which have AOE damaging clouds and puzzles. However it's been a long time since I've done one, so I don't remember if it has that flavor text. Those sites will kill an exploration frig very quickly if you do the puzzle wrong. But the solutions should be on youtube.
---
Is it not painfuly obvious he's trying to get people to his twitch stream?
---
There’s a really simple solution to rorquals.
---
1) remove PANIC
---
2) change industrial core so it doesn’t prevent warp but massively increases mass to make them align much slower (or something similar)
---
Excavators will keep rorquals relatively close to rocks so they can’t really perma-align like carriers can.
---
Good pilots can still get safe if they see intel spiking. Bad pilots will get caught and die as they should.
---
That's one way to put it.
---
I think it would be more accurate to say they were farming DRF while their allies were losing all their space.
---
Whatever the case may be, Tri tossed CO2 under the bus.

Agreed, this was the argument for why skill injectors were introduced in the first place. Even with injectors we still have people asking "am I too late" and "is it possible to catch up". 
---
I'd love to go back and never introduce injectors but instead make an official in-game character bazaar that's easy to use. It was interesting trying to value a character based on what you need it for and deducting "useless" skills.
---
I'd still like to see injectors balanced though. On top of the existing diminishing returns  system there should be a second diminishing returns based on skill class or skill multiplier. It wouldn't affect most subcap, industry and support skills but would be a second barrier to injecting straight into a super or rorqual.

those triage fits .... yikes

I also just subscribe with my debit card. I feel like I'd be screwing the people who really can't afford to pay real money if I used my huge isk income just to save a couple bucks. For all their foibles CCP has a great game I don't mind paying for (well, having thousands of fun goons to play with, makes it a great game). 
---
I remember this mission... she tries to gate away, gets alpha'd by a hail of cruise missiles.
---
Is the isk really worth the losses? 
---
that does not work that well if your screens are differend res (1680*1050 and 1920*1080) 
---
That was the game we all love? Who?
---
The vast silence majority of the players love the game as it is NOW.
---
Almost any experienced players used injectors and get profit for them (which are the really source of any of the issues you exposed), now a few of them whine all the day because of the consequences.
---
But those consequences were cristal clear to everyone the same day that CCP presented injectors.
---
Anyone knew that injectors will be useful mainly to experienced players with a lot of isks, noobs simply don't have the money to pay them or don't have any idea on where to assign those SP.
---
Solution?
---
- Limit the use of injectors to alpha with less than 5M sp
---
- On Omega or Alpha with more than 5M sp turn sp injected to injectors and give to those characters the opportunity to reassign all the sp remained
---
This will significantly drop the number of titan/super/capital pilots and will drop the prices of injectors for alpha characters with more opportunities for new players. 
---
got it! thank you.
---
They introduced "Team Size Matters" which made some alpha ship changes (frig/dessie/cruiser) late 2017. But after that they pretty much stopped.   
---
The problem was that the devs on the balance team were actually part of other teams aswell, like working on citadels etc, which were a higher priority. In short there was never really a dedicated balance team.
---
&gt;We're at a point where bots and players are legitimately hard to tell apart
---
What is this bullshit?
---
The only thing that has changed is that players who bot are feeling the heat (from other players bitching, not CCP).
---
&gt;there aren't really any tools available for players to accurately and consistently prove someone's a bot
---
What would you expect? This is something CCP has to solve, which shouldnt be too hard in at least some cases given that they have a massive baseline for what is considered normal "autist" behaviour. When the bots go beyond that, they should be flagged and auto-banned.
---
is this what a nano gang is?
---
Because its bonus (warp disruption range) scales very bad with its main weapon platform (blasters). Its slot layout doesn’t help either. Its only use (ar least what I love to do with it) is do cloaky. Ganking around null. You can use blasters for face-melting dps, or go with rails and keep range from cyno bait. 
---
But to be honest, the loki is better for that aswell.
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **6th Cakeday** Stukya! ^(hug)

suiciding 5-10b in dreads to kill a 10b rorqual is dumb and will only cause the other rorquals to make more isk since now 4-6 capital hulls just got blown up
---
You had the largest super fleet and the most guarded space in the history of Eve. When it really mattered though, to truly use it, you all didn't.        
---
       Also, I'm unsure at what point in Eve history was rorqual mining considered "the best or only way to get rich". You would be mistaken to believe its the only way to make money.     
---
    Rorquals are bad because they are good at too many things.

How does CCP profit?

Your coalition fractured after the start of that war, not before. 
---
As soon as the fight was brought to your door the fat and lazy said "Fuck this, I don't want to actually fight people.".
---
I'll give you C02, they switched sides, but going into the war CFC absolutely had more supers. If the first sign of pressure didn't break the lines, you'd have won.
---
You could say that you were out numbered, but communication between these entities was limited. It was a bunch of random alliances paid to shoot Goons, not a cohesive group that fights together all the time.
---
Either way you really should think before drinking the Goon-Aid. 
---
They dont post the lists of banned bots because they dont ban many bots. Not much "hunting" going on.
---
As I recall, it was TEST who turned on CO2 after CO2 engaged the DRF in theoretical war before becoming entrenched in a losing war that Gigx didn't expect. This was in turn ended in a very sudden way by Judge

Suicide? Rorqs are still locked in place. Cyno inhibs give a good chance of making it out, depending on how turbo afk or spodbrain the rorq is. Dread cyno goes up, inhib goes down. So you risk a cyno ship if the rorq cynos too, but at least it's a better shot. Right now there's no point.
---
just imagine acl'd hangers  
---
Show us on the doll where Snuffed touched you.

Because it's obvious he wants to nerf the 'higher skill' Titan gameplay and leave papa Goon's blob style use intact.

---
Yeah :D
---
Sounds like the solution would be covered in a large part by moving to j-space. Wormholes are fun dude, you should give it a try sometime.
---
Agreed
---
Personally, I think making Rorq panic's stop all current active cynos (on the rorq) and prevent new ones from being lit would help. Maybe adding a 30 sec 'spool up' to cynos, like on entosis.
---
Also null local needs a delay of some kind.

Correction. Ban the stupid bots and **not** players. AFKer multiboxers are not players. I played this game 3-4 times now since it launched all the way back in 2003, hell, I think I still have the original CD somewhere, but am too lazy to dig through boxes of old shit, and never had any issues affording to welp ships. Only morons require botting / multiboxing.
---
In addition, while there was always botting and multiboxing in this, never, ever before has it been on this scale and proportions. The game ran just fine without them for many many years and when they're gone it will run just fine, in fact a hell of a lot better because we'll have more actual players instead of player owned NPCs to play with and against.
---
No, he's dirtying the pool, there are bigger problems, if he's genuinely concerned about constructive dialogue, he'd back some of the suggestions mentioned here. 
---
The thing is, this was always worked into Eve's design fundamentally, with the way 20% of the time training a skill gives you 80% of the benefit, apart from level V prerequisites.  A new player can train up to all IVs relevant to a given ship in virtually no time and be completely competitive with veterans.  Past a certain point progression is mostly breadth and flexibility, not depth/power.  It's always been one of the most prominent misconceptions about Eve.
---
If anything I'd be inclined to point the blame at capital proliferation/dominance in this case as well.  The above applies best to subcaps, while capitals have very long up-front training times with lots of prerequisite gates.  With everyone pushing for more caps, new players will naturally want to fly caps, and compared to subcaps this inflates the required skill training for basic competence dramatically.
---
Basically, capitals as line ships instead of flagships pushes new players toward longer frontloaded training times, which exacerbates the gap with old players and demands skill injectors, which open the way for more capitals pilots, which reinforces capitals as line ships...
---
I have only one question. Why is his mom awake at 5am?
---
something something pos code
---
You're the moron. Game has been awesome for so many years, in fact much better then it is now, without all these shitty ass multiboxers and bots. Sure, they were here but no where on this scale and this harmful before.
---
We used to have cyno alts, trade alts, scout, scanning alts etc. Which was OK. Nowadays you have 5-50 Rorq or VNI alts instead breaking the whole fucking game economy.
---
Nah top one was in belt with rorqual mining. 
---
Well, you're going to recall whichever version of the narrative you choose to recall.
---
Whatever the case may be, CO2 had to choose between being blue to Tri, and being blue to Test.  They made their own bed.
---
Coming from the guy living with his parents, and asking to be paid ISK to be in an alliance, because he is space broke. Good one.

---
rally points
---
I keep saying the exact same thing, and I always hear that, but now I'm starting to realize I've never actually met anyone that didn't like it
---
I don't think Capitals are too powerfull tbh. They are meant to be one Pilot against many Subcaps, if you look at it ISK wise there is no reason to not let them apply against smaller ships if they fit properly. Also a reasonable gang of small ships with ewar etc. can kill a Super / Titan if you look at bombers bar.
---
The Problem is the Age of the Game and that single Capitals can outperform certain fleetnumbers. If you stack up capitals the subcap fleet to counter them needs to exceed some thousand dudes and thats not feasible for those "muh elite PvPers" who refuse to become part of a powerblock themselfes because they want to kill ships with their two multiboxxing and inputbroadcasting buddys, also looking at bombers bar.
---
Capitals in a Fleet are hard to deal with so you might look into that "stacking of capitals ships" but saying that they apply too well is weird because they individually don't against a small but reasonable composited fleet of usefull logistics and electronic warfare all within a 1v1 ISK ratio.  
---
20-30bil ISK of what a Super is worth can pay for a nasty Bomberfleet with Falcon / Pilgrim Support and T3C logistics.  
---
Sou you have same Investments on both sides.

This could be something that comes along with logi on killmails. Why stop at logi? Make it so if you are in a fleet, on grid with something that gets killed, you get credit for it just as the killer and damaging parties would.
---
But to be frank having to add a new instance of data tracking in-game for any of the hundreds if not thousands of fleets that go up and down every day would be a coding nightmare.

They explicitly say that their whole process for banning bots involves tracing the money back, which is why they'll go radio silent and then suddenly ban thousands of accounts at once.

This kind of chest thumping doesn't impress me in world of warcraft and it's not going to impress me here, if you have something substantive to add then add it this is just pointless babble.

It's adorable to me that you think bots and multiboxers are a new phenomena. 
---
Read point two. Part of why supers are strong is cynos. 
---
Buff cyno inhibs. Nerf cyno + PANIC. Maybe even both. 
---
Nah I thought it was cool. I liked sitting on the couch watching tv.
---
Remind me again why they removed it? Was it legacy code updates or something?
---
Or alliance contact tags, had to log out and log back in 3 times to make sure my alliance contact tags I set actually updated correctly rather than randomly disappearing like they do if you stay online.
---
I still think the only jump-abilities there should be is bridges and JumpFreighters. Blam, all of a sudden caps are good for slowmo SOV-crawling, but no more "Oh, surprise! We re everywhere!". Subcaps d be the thing to use when doing stuff 20J away in enemy territory.. We d eventually have real border-fights, dreads in trenches n stuff.  
---
Else, what are all that crybabies about the Rorqs being "unkillable"? Rorqs die all the time. You just can not demand that every ship you manage to drop a bubble on is killable by a small gang. Yeah, a Rorq is a nice, big target. But to get that KM you HAVE TO hold that fokking grid for a while. And, yeah, there might be ppl coming to shoot you in return. Thats why its called PvP and not PvR. If you can not deal with a groups respond-fleet you re attacking the wrong group at the wrong time and/or you prepared bad.
---
As a newbean looking to get into PVP and combat in general, is a neural remap in order? If so, how should I remap?
---
Da, tovarisch.
---
I think?
---
1. Activate bridge cyno
---
2. Bridge in brick tanked buffer maller with jump cyno
---
3. Activate jump cyno
---
C) Conditions shouldn't make it so that only one type of fleet is effective, remember Machs online because of void bombs?
---
 Ok so its bonuses are incongruent for PVP applications, why is it bad for wormhole PVE then?
---
No, we did not have the biggest superfleet. We won B-R5 due to being allied with the Russians (who were semi-relevant at the time.) If you think that we did, you're just wrong.
---
lmfao
---
What are you talking about? If we catch wind of asset safety being removed, we'll forcibly evac every single member of the alliance by unanchoring and reanchoring our keepstars. CCP can't introduce such a huge change as removing k-space asset safety without enough warning for us to pull our shit up.
---
If a mobile depot is put into armour during the anchoring stage, you'll be able to destroy it even if it fully anchors without going through a reinforcement cycle. Chances are groups are starting to hit the depot into armour, waiting a while and then killing the depot in the hopes to get the drones.
---
No, we didn't have more supers. You're thinking of the fact that we won B-R5, a thing we would not have done without the support of the then-relevant Russians.
---
Shit, nonconsensual watch lists were a thing back then, so you guys have hard numbers due to having a list of every supercap pilot we had. Feel free to dredge up those numbers and prove me wrong.

Where I get hazy, does each P3 product need its own P3 factory planet, or do the feeder planets move slow enough that I can mutli-purpose 1 P3 factory planet?  Same question with the P4 planet, can it double as a P3 planet part of the time?
---
Thanks o7
---
Ghost Site would be my guess.  Nothing interesting happens during the first 1 to 2 minutes then big badda boom along with NPC's that tackle you.
---
Also, you missed my point entirely about Rorquals. Don't strawman.
---
Only a small percentage of the player base used it and took up a lot of development time to keep it working.
---
My take on it is mostly from sub cap point of view as I haven't flown a cap in over a year, more then a year. I got so sick and tired of all this shit piling up in NS that I decided to leave it in Dec 2014 - Jan 2015, but I did keep some alts and still logged on here and there when some of my old mates did. Love playing with the guys. That was the only and exclusive reason for me doing so.
---
Once they stopped logging in on their caps, I did as well. So nowadays my cap interaction is limited either to occasional forays (being in fleet) to try to catch them or fuck around and run them around on pointless chases a bit.
---
So I do understand my opinions are my own, and people do and feel different about it, but here are mine:
---
1. Capital game play has made people log off, many permamently, due to how shitty from every aspect it is. This is primarily what happened with us, and it is from all aspects. Imbalance in combat as well as cap vs cap as well as whole process of obtaining caps, their cheap ass production costs and botting / multiboxing that has led us to the current rate of proliferation. It is all tied together.
---
2. Combat wise caps have flat out too many defenses, too much EHP and do too much DPS, they do not scale in a linear fashion with sub caps, they don't even scale on  a half decent curve. It is a fucking cliff, its why its called the "**balance gap"**, due to that cliff. This cliff is the primary reason for all the combat issues and needs to be brought down on some sort of a curve. The curve and where things woudl land is of course up to CCP based on how many of X ships types they want in a fleet taking out a cap.
---
3. Caps in general are too immune or resistant to sub cap style Ewar. There needs to be more available as far as point and various ewar options for sub-caps vs caps.
---
4. Need more then just nano meta to effectively fight them.
---
5. Fighters are too effective vs sub caps and have too few ways of taking them out for sub cap fleets. Need more options here.
---
6. Alternatively, instead of straight out super nerfing cap DPS and EHP, could bring up the sub caps, but then imagine a VNI with 5x hit points and 3-4 x the DPS. It woudl not work out at all in the game as ratting in one would go to whole new rediculous proportions and its too much to change entire game to fit that. So it is better to nerf caps rather then to buff sub caps to such huge proportions.
---
In addition other things can be done as well such as allowing some battleships to equip and use XL weapons much like some BCs can use L weapons now, just flat out remove sensor arrays, completely.
---
Some people will argue that then caps will be nerfed back to uselessness as before, but the gameplay before was 100x better then it is now. So while I do not want things to go that far, if it does come down to it, I'd rather have it like it was with the caps being termed as "useless" then how it is now, because it was just plainly and simply better.
---
I have some ideas for continuing the full scene (But what also gets caught in a stop bubble?) but the entire scene is some 3-4 minutes long, which is waaay to much for a single gif. 
---
Lumiooooooooooooooooooo
---
The problem with your assumption is that bots and players cannot coexist. The current state of the game is proof that they can. This is a big part of the likely reason that CCP hasn't taken drastic measures to remove them. 
---
Contrary to popular belief bots aren't destroying the game left right and center. So damaging the game to remove them isn't a good move to make. Mutually assured destruction with bots isn't a good game to play.
---
What most of the solutions suggested here amount to is cutting off your nose to spite your face. You froth with hatred for bots i get it, but i don't blame CCP for not wanting to seriously damage the community just to take minor shots at bots that won't do much *if any* damage to the botting.
---
In this case the wrong thinkers are the ones who genocide and the creation of an ethnostate by force aa central tent poles of their ideology. Vs the guys who think that is a bad thing and are willing to stop them at any cost.
---
Hitler himself said it after hia ascenaion to power: had they been fought in the streets and smashed to bits, they would have never succeeded in taking power.
---
Holy shit. Are you really whining over having to buy a second fucking Ferox?
---
Of course! people forget this is a video game and not a job. Have fun and just try and disrupt their money making bullshit as much as you can. A calling in a way :). For people that get passive income, they get really salty about it.
---
I mean that's what happened before there were athanors...
---
Nice try Hilmar. 
---
“removing PANIC would mean that a dread bomb can kill the rorq before supers get on grid.”
---
Maybe I don’t understand the point here then.
---
htfu
---
but you'd know that if you'd actually read my posts.
---
All you achieve with that is everybody is just getting +1 account to have a brick tanked jump cyno on stand by. That is no real deal for all these heavy duty crabbers and wont change anything for engagements between small gangs and big blocks/umbrellas ... Change my mind\^\^
---
How does it feel to wake up every day with your head so far up your own ass
---
I laughed because it is true that goonswarm is only about 30 real players with a 1000 bots each, but it would have been funnier to go the other way and belabor the fact that Mittens only actually logs into the game about once a decade. Throw in a joke about a his newly discovered strategy called POS bowling. How he's really looking forward to walking in stations. How he can almost pay for an account entirely off of his hundred dollar media empire. That sort of thing.
---
I don't see anything there about decent small gang content, but since you're a test mongo you probably can only kill procs with your gangs anyways
---
I did. Like three times because I wanted to be sure.
---
Africanized ~~Incursion~~ FOP Rats
---
Ah yes! Makes sense. 
---
I see no use for reinforcement anyways. Rorquals abuse it by saving 70% of their potential loss. I wish ccp would actually remove it.
---
Why is there no cyno inhibitor module for a hic?
---
I’ve read both Templar one and empyrean age. They’re good eve reading. however the ratings and reviews I saw on the burning life labeled it as the weakest of the series, and might be explanation for how untouched it is compared to the other two. 
---
The Eve community as a whole is pretty awesome.  I think that a lot of us are older and have moved on from the Teenage Angst years. I find the social aspect of this game is what really keeps me playing. A lot of cool nerds out there. Even if they're Goons, PanFam, etc...
---
I can't even play the fps games anymore do to the toxicity. It's not that I can't handle it, it's that I want to reach through the computer and...
---
I feel like removing local would be the single best thing to do with the game. 
---
i won't tell you to try a 4th, that clearly won't help.
---
let me make it simple; demanding people have a large number of different ships, most of which will never be undocked or called for, in a bunch of different places that they won't be most of the time is a pain doesn't promote any kind of interesting or worth while gameplay.
---
know what i'd rather be doing than wasting isk seeding shit i don't need in places i won't go to? i'd rather be having some fun.
---
The problem is both, because injectors dramatically accelerate the scale and timeline of a problem. Instead of it being a bit of an issue two years down the line, it's a big fucking issue, *right fucking now*.
---
RIP nulli never forget
---
I talk about my mistakes and learn from them all the time.  One of my strengths actually.  At least I don't blame server lag when my dread bomb fucks up.  
---
Yeah, pretty much.
---
i would add no thetering  while u got npc timer or aggro timer
---
Fake. Was obvious after the logging in part - Mittens never logs in. 
---
Yeah, she turned a guy into a newt. Luckily he got better.
---
To add to this you won’t be able to safe log because the bumper will have you locked. If you have attempted to warp to a celestial (station or gate) and then you close out of the game (not safe log) then after a minute your ship will warp off to that celestial (happens even if you’re being bumped), land, then warp back to a safe within 1 million KM from where you logged off. If you login during the first warp to the celestial you are forced to warp back to the spot in which you logged off at... so you can’t cancel warp and try to dock or jump gate.
---
If you log back in and find your ship sitting at your safe and then log off again you will warp another 1 million KM away from that spot.
---
There’s some grey area exploity stuff that can and does happen between all this, but unless you witness it you won’t know it’s happening.
---
When you’re being bumped it’s difficult to counter-bump unless the bumper is really bad. Having a proper Webber to web your freighter into warp is good, but there are good gankers that can and will counter that... best to just leave the hauling to some poor idiot that will take 20m to move 1b+ worth of cargo. 
---
Welcome to Dave land, enjoy your stay
---
That I agree with
---
Having to run 2 engines side by side instead of keeping manpower on the one engine 99% of the game runs on was deemed unnecessary. Can't blame them for doing that decision but man do I miss my CQ... https://i.imgur.com/45I0m3D.png
---
I don't find PGLs balance push infuriating. In fact I see it as a good thing. 
---
Whether he's right or wrong, not comprehensive enough, missed this or that, it started a conversation.  A conversation that needs to be had, publicly within the Eve community.  PGL has brought things into the open and is providing a platform for discussion. Discussion, Civil Discourse, and debate are all very good tools to help get a point across.

HAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Wait. The rorqual can hardly fight back....so his 1k DPS with heavies and smart bombs and heavy neuts etc.?
---
So he should have the ability to tank upwards of 40-50 bombers or other pilots. A 7 minute invulnerability. All because he is a industrial ship?
---
Yeah and as we clearly see... nobody lives in wormholes. I think we should give wormholes asset safety.
---
Simply because there are better alternatives. The proteus performs very bad when engaged. It’s also one of the slowest choices which doesn’t help either. When doing exploration your only risk is being ganked which means you will want the best option to defend yourself.
---
As for actual PVE, the sleepers (who inhabit combat sites) are simply too strong for the proteus, the limited tank possibilities combined with its poor range and speed make it a bad choice for PVE purposes.
---
Piotr getting shit on by Garst, lol
---
Incursions,Fobs,Burners missions,abyss sites,Event Sites
---
To add to that... The guys that timezone tanked us, couldn't even form 2 or 3 people in that timezone. Only issue is that well.... My ideal wednesday isn't waking up at 8am, phoning in sick, and shooting a undefended structure.
---
Not really, no. You need quite absurd amount of dreads (about 60) to volley a Rorqual that doesn't press PANIC in time, in case of supercap umbrella, with people ready to jump in at any time, 10-man dreadbomb (total value about 2.5x value of a Rorqual) needs about 20-27s to kill one. If you even have to login supers, that is more than enough time to react if people are present and listening to what's going on, but probably not enough to react if you're relying on a ping.
---
What PANIC changes is that it allows time to form up and organize a response fleet before going, instead of forcing said response fleet to be ready in first place, and - in case of players that struggle under stress - allows them some time to calm down and clearly communicate what's happening. Basically, it reduces error margin for reaction significantly, by literally extending time of a gank to the point where being prepared puts nearly no constant effort on defending side. So no, if you're ready to deal with drops, supers will load grid before Rorqual dies even without PANIC, just sometimes you won't be able to kill dreads fast enough to save a Rorqual - unless you're not ready to save your miners, in which case they're dead before you can react and best you could hope for is to have revenge kills on still sieged dreads that effectively cost much more even after insurance.
---
More about "how long does it take to kill a Rorqual without PANIC" - full 255 man bomber fleet needs 4 volleys (20s) to kill one, 5 gank supers guarantee one-volley on active tanked Rorqual (single gank super takes about a minute due to salvo cycle time), you need two doomsdays to kill a Rorqual (single titan takes about 2 minutes), 20 carriers take about 30s for one, blops are a joke dps-wise in relation to caps. Anything else can be spotted gating and get everyone ready and setup to go in case they tackle something (or encourage active reaction and trying to intercept the gang moving in your space).
---
The best idea on /r/eve I've seen in a while.
---
Universe might be my favorite flavor of Stargate. The writing, sfx, and concept was so good. The only thing holding it back from the top spot is it's brevity vs original Stargate's long run. When it ended so abruptly I was legitimately angry.
---
Basically this - PANIC doesn't change much if response is present and ready to go, it only saves people/groups that are unaware of what's going on, unable to react immediately or unwilling to put constant effort into keeping themselves safe.
---
Isn't that good thing? If you get outstrategized as a group and can't get escalation threat going, you have to actually be good in order to have some advantage?
---
there are not many alliances in eve that will have supers on grid within 5 minutes.
---
You can even do the same shit with Enjo or Punisher in other space.
---
Add a forth gun to dreads and a lot of the cap problems are fixed. Dreads are balanced vs subcaps, being stuck in place for 5 mins means subcaps can control the fight vs them, but they are horribly underpowered vs the things they should be good at - melting fax, supers, titans and structures.
---
Last time the dreads got a buff was the last time we saw any tent being made to the super umbrellas of 2013-14. Since then things have changed but dreads have remained the same.
---
Some peeps forget that they actually memorize the rf Status so if it gets rfed and you dont repackage the next round is a kill 
---
I like how the argument against boosh Raven stems from
---
&gt;We were outnumbered
---
&gt;we got split up
---
&gt;We couldn't coordinate
---
&gt;We didn't support each other
---
But no, it's the boosh Ravens that are too strong. Not the complete and total failure to know how to fight together in a cohesive fleet.
---
I’m not farmiliar with big fleet tactics, and I don’t understand exactly why rokhs are much different from the ferox doctrine that we already use. They are both sniping hybrid shield tanked doctrines (If I’m understanding right), and even if ferox fleet comp doesn’t have booshers you could add a couple without too much trouble. What makes rokhs different than feroxes?
---
As far as i am concerned we can go back to barges + boosts. 
---
I'd like to leave the rorq some yield herself, but it doesn't need to be more than a Hulk.
---
also, you can remotely set your home to your racial starter school station at anytime. even while your normal remote home change is on cooldown.
---
Go play another game
---
Condensed killboard warrior salt in one post
---
Huh?
---
I'm pretty sure PANIC and the retarded local tank were designed with a gating subcap response fleet in mind, not immediately jumping in super alts from staging. But maybe not. Maybe CCP wanted this after all. 
---
Yeah remove it. With panic and cap umbrella it's unnecessary.
---
No problem. I find it interesting - as a phrase it's relatively new, roughly originating in the 70s. 
---
There is something installed on your machine that is interfering.   It might be a virus scanner or a bad driver.  It could even be a hardware fault in the machine.  It could just be a bad configuration of something you have or the fact that your internet connection is garbage.  
---
In 4 years of playing I’ve never had to reinstall the client.  
---
if you dont approach the economic issue behind caps, there are no nerfs that will work aside from taking away all their weapons. rorqs + injectors + the ease of new engineering complexes in comparison to old super / titan pos manufacturing = runaway capital meta.
---
He's not wrong though.
---
Its maybe just me but i think there are escalation days, faction spawn days and dread days. I hate ratting but when i do it i run 100 havens in a row with 4 sb machs and some days i get tons of escalations with no faction spawns or dreds. Some days i get tons of dreds with no faction or escalation.anyone else noticed?
---
One of the books is absolutely terrible, like Dan Brown level horrible with its writing, never mind the plot. I believe it was the last one in the series.
---
&gt; I see no use for reinforcement anyways. Rorquals abuse it by saving 70% of their potential loss.
---
That *is* the use of reinforcement though. People were doing this to save blingy mods off their tackled wormhole dreads long before Rorquals were buffed.
---
I don't like the mechanic either, but it's not "abusing" just because it sucks.
---
I’ve only read the two in pic by tony, and the ratings and reviews kept me from reading the burning life, which isn’t by him and is probably why it is bad.

r/woosh
---
He’s suggesting PANIC should be removed so that rorqs become killable.  
---
You all aren't the only ones use rorqual's. Of course it helped increase the wealth of your line members but the same is true for everyone else.
---
Its always funny to watch the rat fleet rampaging in a system. They sometimes reinforce structures.
---
Neural remake should only be done once you know what skills you’re going to train for the next year or so. You only get one remap per year so use it wisely. If you like to change your mind a lot on what you’re training then remapping isn’t a good idea. 
---
You're out of touch. I'm not wasting my time arguing with someone who should probably play a different game.

---
I agree being allied to the russians is a major addition that put you over the top. There were however many other things that helped seal our fate. You've always outnumbered us, but at times you all haven't been willing to fully commit to break critical mass. What makes PL special is its precision and well trained super fleet. Obviously we're more cohesive but there is a critical mass that we just can't deal with. Same holds true with NC.
---
  or is it?
---
Please try to shove 500 supercarriers through a gate and tell me your results.  Talk about disincentives for deploying anywhere. Did you even think about this before you typed.
---
It is too bad he didnt just fade away when Nulli Secunda did.
---
Pretty good advice tbh
---
Blasters are very poor for PvE in general as you'll spend most of your time travelling to get into range and applying turret damage well at extreme close range relies on support modules like stasis webs and tracking computers. Blasters are only best on paper for peak DPS in optimum conditions, but application is very poor under most real conditions.
---
No and its not raw its sped up. raw is 01:15:00 long and why would i record coms?

The main reason I don’t do incursions isn’t any of that, it’s because you have to work with 40 other people in incursion comms, which are the worst comms on the planet.

I’ve been kicking about the idea of an active module for a while, coupled with a buff to mobile inhibs (in pretty much every way), and we might have a nice wee shake up. Not perfect, but not this current mess we have.

---
Agreed. Rorq panic is quite strong, why not make it harder to fit/have some debuffs when it isn’t active. Many things in EVE are you get something but you give something up. PANIC is a straight 100% upgrade, 0 downsides. Why not make drones mine less while you have a PANIC fitted, that way you have to choose between efficiency and safety? Some debuff while having it equipped (not active) would be good. Or just not allow them to use a cyno within X time of panicing/panic within X time of cynoing
---
Also agree with having more tackle rats in sites. Would also help with catching botters. Ofc they could just fit a warp core stab or two, but then they’re making less ISK, which is better for the game.
---
Don’t think removing local is a good idea, that would bring null too close to wormholes, and those playstyles should be distinct.
---
Terrible idea... 
---
in nullsec, this is called volunteering to be primary target.
---
and i've seen FCs call this with joy
---
It took a dozen rorquals working for a week to mine enough ore for a Titan, and there are more investments required to even build one
---
You saw the rorquals mining, capitals roaming around, but you didn't see decade worth of investments from those alliance accumulated
---
Meanwhile, it took less than 20 mins for a few dreads to blob a lonely Titan down
---
The problem with EVE is not "shits are to easy to acquire", but the game itself perfectly demonstrate the risk-averse nature of players, or modern cavemen in general
---
If you just make shits even harder to get in EVE, players will just form even larger blobs to compensate

or. give marauders a module so when they go into bastion mode, and activate this module, they act as a cyno inhib. kill the marauder and you can cyno titans on them.
---
but if you don't, marauder now has a use outside of wh ratting
---
"today" probably being the relevant part in that comment!

It's not, it is just some random common rant strapping together

My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your post gave me cancer anyway.

This

They need to up frigate velocity. There is no reason that in sanctums/havens that a frigate should only go 500ish m/s. Those little shits should go 4-5km/s, and should prioritize pointing the ship on grid.
---
kids with disabilities need some content aswell 
---
We've outnumbered you in bodies, sure, but not supercaps. Not until we got stuck in down here in Delve.
---
I don't know if even CCP would think that - I have hard time imagining any group that would use Rorqual and not have at least one bridging titan.
---
true,  but its still more use than it is now.
---
for example, your fleet sitting on a titan, cyno goes up. marauder and fleet all go in to the tackled target. lets say its a rorq.
---
fleet in, marauder activates module.  no help is coming for rorq unless a different cyno gets lit from outside the marauder's range.
---
yeah its not that useful, and is probably more expensive than its worth.   but to be fair its still more than it has now. which is nothing outside of ecm resist....
---
b-but black man bad!!
---
Wealth doesn't build titans, there, Chester.
---
Cause your alliance is made up mostly of people that cant even pilot their own ship.
---
You guys would lose capitals quicker, the ability to remake them would be slowed. You guys would feed more miners, meaning they will stop playing because they are risk averse little fuckbois.
---
That is how
---
If they were serious, they would target both botting and input broadcasting. Both would lead to a DRAMATIC change in the MER. You're right, they may not care, but players who DON'T bot and DON'T input broadcast do. They see CCP doing nothing but lip service and it turns them away from the game.

Pretty certain that any immobile blops BS is gonna get straight-up volleyed by a super/titan.  They are... not tanky.

If you can't get supers on grid within 5 minutes, chances are you're unable to form proper response to a dreadbomb regardless of how long it takes and having PANIC or not changes nothing for them. It changes a lot for groups that have big supercap fleet available - because lack of PANIC means small mistakes or taking just a little too long to react can be effectively punished.

Good! So let's say the effect "scrams" the BS instead of immobilization. It can't use mwd/mjd and warp out. But it can orbit a titan under his guns. I will edit my post. Thanks.

For supers, you can actually tank the fighters if you have a proper buffer tank, logi and ewar on the fighters.

I deployed to Querious to shit on a USTZ group, Imperium Divine and their allies Axiom Vocation Alliance back in 2017. Both groups outnumbered us, Feign Disorder. We had about 9 people, each group had 30+.
---
We started invading their pocket, W-IX39. We were taking their SOV, hitting their structures and it was a fun experience.
---
Want to know what this USTZ group did? Changed their Vulnerability timers, ALL OF THEM, to EUTZ. They knew that noone in the area could take their SOV or hit their Structures then, because QFC would protect it.
---
We still harassed them. Found their JF, https://zkillboard.com/kill/61959204/ because they were still active during USTZ. Found out timers they were showing up for and ass blasting them, https://zkillboard.com/related/30003998/201704280400/
---
In the long run, group that are huge pussies like that fully integrate into some large alliance so they can have their safe space. I guess that is what eve is
---
Plot twist, those FCs are just goons who found a way around having to burn the spy every time
---
This 1000%
---
While I realize this is going to be down voted to hell due to flair. We (the player base) keep electing the same people to CSM, and expect something to change. It's nice to think that CCP is here, reading reddit for balance ideas but they aren't. They do however listen to the CSM. Want change, vote in someone new. If you don't we aren't going to get away from the invincible rorq spam, and the fort building that is current citadel mechanics.
---
I know it can be configured that's hardly the point.  I guess it's less annoying for new players since they aren't doing nearly as much.

---
The range. Boosh Rokhs hit to 300km. Feroxes hit to about 140.
---
And that would be ok.  If the athanors were killable with one timer and vulnerable 24/7.  Oh and the time of that one timer had a wide window of when it could come out.  Oh and if the athanor died everything in it dropped (or was subject to loot fairy).  Oh and the defenses of the athanor could be Incapped....
---
I could go on but you get the point.....
---
Although bots can be dominant in money making arenas, there tends to be enough demand for materials gained in such activities to allow real players to still grind out some isk. And don't even worry about pvp. Bots can't pvp at all, you won't have to contend with a fleet of bots(or if you do, they just don't have the flexibility to deal with anything that you would do).
---
If you're using Megacyte as the barometer for the health of the mineral market, you're badly misinformed. The current mineral basket has Zyd and Mega hideously oversupplied compared to consumption of other materials, so of course it's in the toilet. Adding moon mining to highsec (with ample nullsec ore moons) didn't help either.
---
Why are people complaining try to drop anything in a home region expect to get wrecked or bring the numbers to deal with the after effect. Escalation of force that’s all this is you attacked enemy replied not your fault if you can escalate higher.
---
Everyone wants an I win button and if not we will bitch and moan about it on reddit.
---
And try out things like the new abyssal pve, that would be hard for bots to do and there are some fits for relatively cheap ships that can run the sites 
---
Eh, that's a lot less likely to happen.
---
I don't think that is [true.](https://zkillboard.com/kills/w-space/)
---
I see. Thank you for sharing that insight.
---
Makes sense honestly. Bannimg one bot doesn't really make it that difficult to repair the damage. They can just make a new account, get restocked from their buddies or corporation, and get right back to botting.
---
Banning everyone connected though at the same time? There's no way their corrupt buddies can help them.
---
Thanks for reminding me of this proposal. I edited my post to include it. In the edit is my answer to the proposal. Here is a c/p
---
-----------------------
---
Edit - Bad idea #4: Give Marauder bastion the cyno inhibition effect (as reminded by Arenta As reminded.)
---
I have also seen proposals for the Marauder bastion to act as a cyno inhib. I think this is another bad idea. Remember, people hunting these capitals operate deep inside hostile nullsec. People use nimble, fast warping, hard to catch ships to be able to begin to operate in that space. Marauders can't do that (except situations like wormhole ragerolling directly into target pocket). Marauders can accompany neither to non-covert or covert fleets operating deep inside hostile null. Meanwhile, a cheaper/smaller/faster ship would reduce the risk the attacker is taking. Blops is the ideal ship, because it costs a good amount to be considered a risk, and it can accompany both covert and non-covert fleets as long as there is one covert cyno in the fleet.
---
Thats how I found out about one, I logged in one day to find out my athanor had been reinforced. I later sold its location to some russians.
---
But thats the fun part.
---
Blops works for me.
---
All I care about is it isn’t as spammable as intys.
---
Still marauders need some buff.....
---
in the tv adaptation she wil have blue eyes, brown hair and have the body of a 14 year old boy.
---
You combine 2 problems, which are connected, no doubt. Of course there is a problem about the role of capitals and supercapitals. But even if titans (just as top line example) were still much rarer and only used in large scale warfare, there would still be a cruicial need for them at any level of nullsec alliance.
---
For years, new player alliances like Brave and TEST (old, newbro TEST), had little chance to graduate in terms of power level due to the constant threat of old alliances. This allowed the alliances like PL to farm those smaller alliances into the ground, while driving players away, out of these alliances. This probably cost us hundreds of players. 
---
Not only, but for sure also thanks to the skill injectors and rorqs, new player groups like PH, TEST, BRAVE, karmafleet, had the chance to catch up so fast that they weren't farmed hard enough that they stay at limited size...
---
And honestly, anything, really anything, that buffs newbro oriented alliances is a good change. Nerf/Buff the mining situation (buff the smaller stuff, nerf rorqs etc)
---
Hmm i see. I was thinking about trying the proteus because i only have Gallente Cruiser 5 (&lt;3 Ishtar) but i guess i'll start looking into training Caldari Cruiser 5.
---
Mittibittimuffins/10
---
We do it with Enyo and Ishkur, Harpys sometimes time in PanFam Space...
---
So im speaking from exp. but I fit properly.
---
Replace all fighter MWDs with MJDs like on LR Fibos? 
---
Retains long range mobility (no one likes burning fighters for hours) while limiting how well they keep up with fast ships. Also rewards actual skillfull use of timing, prediction and fighter positioning.
---
well you could also limit the frequency to use skill injectors
---
once every week or something. 
---
but ye, your are right, some kind of brake wouldn't be that bad. and usually new players who need them do often not have enough isk to bump a new character up asap
---
I would actually say, give diminishing returns no matter how many SP you got. A new player has too little isk to inject anyways, so there is no need to give a new character 0% diminished return as 99% are alts anyways
---
who?
---
There's a point that tether replaces POS shields (being an actual weaker form of it since aggression matters and you can be bumped) and asset safety the safety of a player built station where having to firesale would have been the worst outcome for the nullsec player.
---
Neither of those was as convenient and spamable as citadel's though. Maybe they should be separated into different structures again, with convenient staging, bubble cage removing PDS and tether safety not being on the same 500m structure.
---
It's a joke about American politics. If you want to know more, knock over your trash bins and dump out the contents, then soak it in kerosene. After that, light it and breath in the toxic fumes while laughing hysterically and occasionally pissing in the fire for good measure.
---
This is the best way to replicate the effect outside of the US.
---
there isn't any point in hyping up a stream if you don't actually stream.  it's not like he's going to make any money from streaming to 150 people for an hour twice a year.
---
well, the thing is, you want subs to bridge in. but well. you could do that also offgrid, as they should be fast enough. so yep, 100% behind your ideas. cyno inhib buff would already be enough if more or less reppable, only hull tank is shit...
---
Nah, this one was on us. We forgot to submit the request.
---
Oh yeah I see
---
That’s what most ~~rallies~~ riots are anyway, right?
---
Indeed. Same trash fire, but with a sense of community of course.
---
When half of the EVE player base can't even English and one forth of them are too cynical to talk to anyone?

Nah

Dude if you don’t know what the fuck you are talking about just don’t say anything. Ffs

Agreed, but IRL as well. I have teleconferences every day at work and the comms discipline is fucking terrible. I have to choke back my impulse to yell at my coworkers to use PTT or get the fuck off the call. 
---
The rate at which you get those dings and pop ups drops pretty quickly as you complete the first few levels.
---
I haven't gotten one in several weeks. :shrug: 
---
It’s a joke - and I’m mining for salt!  Found a vein!
---
its incredibly easy to tell a bot from a live person, it should be incredibly easier for CCP to tell by just looking at account stats or using their brain.
---
eat my ass 
---
So basically injectors. Everything else is a symptom. Maybe injectors could be seen as a symptom of CCP's retarded management.
---
&gt; The AFK VNI fits very nicely in the "manage risk/reward" Eve environment.
---
That depends on how you look at it, afk VNI is absurdly effective effort/reward way of making ISK. The only thing that can't be produced/bought/created in EVE is mantime spent playing, and balancing how much active effort is required to get a reward is big part of balancing PvE.
---
As an example: total investment for ratting super is ballpark of 60bil ISK (assuming you inject from scratch and pay first month sub) and this makes around 300mil/h with full focus on the game. For 60bil you get 5 from-scratch VNI alts, and - both time assuming you go for lowest effort to stay subbed, they make about half of ratting super can. Difference is: VNIs require close to no attention paid to the game, therefore allowing for much longer time spent making ISK, as long as you can just be at your PC and connected to the game.
---
Result of that balance point is: relatively speaking being able to be online longer while paying little attention gives you advantage over people unable to spend as much time playing, but willing to offset that by putting more effort while online. Some time ago (not that long even, 2015-2016) DED running was the high-end nullsec PvE with best reward-per-time-spent, not to mention faciliating huge risk factor (expensive and vulnerable fits); now it's just impossible to outdo VNI spam. As baseline: now you can try as hard as you can, but if you've got full time job there's no way of competing against players who can keep VNI farm running around 14h/day, and that can be seen as a problem.
---
Does the system cost index affect my job installation cost when I am the owner of the raitaru? 
---
Here is a game changer.
---
Revert the 15% fee to the attacker in forms of loot drop, in case attacker maintains 24/7 grid superiority (e.g. they defend an anchorable - perhaps also with damage cap so people can't suicide dreads).
---
I was on a fleet the other day where a spy in our fleet (what a surprise) started giving info on our comms about our fleet and what we were doing, then said "shit, wrong comms"... it was like a mic drop. 
---
Christ, this.
---
I do gifs like this when I have time, because it’s a lot more engaging than actually playing the game some times. 
---
Ultimately, the problem is lack of communication. Is something not fixed because they dont know about it? Or do they not want to fix it? They have a long history of staying the fuck away when shit is starting to hit the fan.

Well, that's why I depot my scanning loot once a while

That 'athanor' would be getting reps from 50 fax, and have 50 titans sitting on it.

You’d also have to give the Marauder a covops cloak for this idea to work

No I do get it.  It was a way better system than what we have now.

Make the next project discovery analyzing mouse movements to find bots
---
In the current era where people can and do volley ratting carriers with bomber fleets, I am a bit surprised at the nuanced point of your argument.  
---
There is a fine line between:
---
"We cannot have good  hunting and fights because of game mechanics"  
---
and  
---
"We cannot have good hunting and fights because of bulk player choices"  
---
that's a shame - i'd love to know what you find fun about wasting a load of isk on a load of ships you're seldom going to use to put in a station you're seldom going to visit.
---
After what has just happened in FIFA Belgium and with the controversy over CSGO.
---
-

CCP acknowledges that it is possible for gambling addicts to buy enormous amounts of plex, regardless of any mechanism to remove said plex back to RL currency.

So any notion or idea to restore EVE Bet etc is not possible without risking a media / legal shit storm

You roam around in an assfrig blob with logi, thats not the same as a solo self repping wolf.

I’m known as Manni torani on the Goon forums from when I owned the character, but I sold that character back in 2015. Not sure who owns it now. 
---
Hope you can make it to a meet sometime.

Its really fucked up that necessary balance decisions are now tied to CCP's bottom line. It seems difficult to come up with a dumber dependency.

Dr. Thingymajingy (forgot his name) was the generic comedic relief science nerd who'd stumble from one accident to the next.

Yeah I am sure they will go away fairly quickly.  Just a bit annoying to get barraged with pings right after coming back.
---
If I'm fleeting up with a friend and he picks up an agent mission that has him kill 12 rats but instead I do the killing, does it register on his PC as a completed mission or does it bug out and only register if he deals the final blow. And how often do level 1 high sec agent missions bug out?
---
Then the 50 man fleets shouldn't be able to teleport around the universe until they find free kills.
---
Yeah the rorqual can't fight back for shit, you're either being disingenuous as fuck or a complete retard.  It's immobile and unable to tackle, which means people keep at range and stay aligned, which means the only outcome with reasonable play is a Rorqual dying helplessly.  Without panic and in a climate of 80+ man bomber gangs, it's dead inside of 60 seconds.
---
And let's not mince words, that's exactly what you're asking for, a return to times where every connection was a free kill, and it's not for the good of the game, it's because zero risk charity frags are what you enjoy.
---
The current "capital umbrella" theories of PvE defense didn't develop in a vacuum, the theories developed as a response to and in a time where a disproportionate fraction of the player base spent pretty much all day scanning and rolling chains, where you might see the same group pop in from a different wormhole every hour or two, and where basically the only counter able to inflict damage to the gangs of 30-50 nanos was a promptly executed cyno drop as they're taking the warpin, because they're burning to 80km off the instant they land, remain aligned to the hole and have eyes on the hole.  And they're absolutely fleet warping the fuck out of there if anything that can even apply damage to them shows up on grid.
---
It's not intrinsically bad for more, better equipped, better organized players to be able to translate those advantages into a kind of safety.  It follows logically, it's intuitive, it's what players expect and gives purpose to many playstyles.  On the other hand, pretty much every tear-soaked post from J. Random Ganker contains at its core a demand which is wholly selfish and can arrive at no end but diminished appeal of the game: I don't care what you have to break or how this affects other playstyles, I just want free kills.
---
Yeh that's exactly their reasoning, and why they don't bother banning individual bots. It's admittedly a little frustrating when you report a bit and still see it floating around, but generally (granted this is a little optimistic) it'll get nuked in a big wave. 
---
Great job! I especially like the part where you put an ounce of effort into any counterpoints.
---
Not sure why you are being down-voted, but to my knowledge scalable, seamless VM management is not really there yet.  I beleive most systems that work on such a premise currently operate on multiple duplicate instances all accessing a central DB or such.  
---
This is not really feasible for eve, since you need both Client -&gt; Server and Client -&gt; Client interactions.  If you instanced the VMs like currently, each Client -&gt; Client interaction would have to pass through some middle interface, similar to how we have system -&gt; system session changes.
---
Has anyone done the alt in an orca for long-term wh camping? I heard it used to be done.

This post gave me gaids.

But we did go through some changes. 
---
As a community, we all agree on the fact we don't want to hear your voice.
---
how many of those did you outnumber your enemies?   
---
Can't smug when you dock as soon as you have slim chances of winning
---
1. It's not a lot of ISK.
---
2. Sometimes it's a strategic advantage to have a staging that is prepared to go at a moments notice.
---
3. The nature of the game requires preparedness and staging in various arenas is a core part of that. 
---
4. Not everything is convenient to 1DQ. What a fucking shit game it would be if it was.
---
5. It's unbecoming to have this argument here.
---
I bought the boxed edition years ago.
---
Countered fuckin hard - well played.  RIP Lif.
---
I swear we're good
---
Maybe they could give it a mobility bonus... like an MJD one for getting out of bubbles quickly. Oh wait.
---
Leshaks, rohk, and rattlesnakes are common enough for rorq hunting groups... a 2b isk ship is not a lot to ask to negate an umbrella.
---
Hahahahaha phucked in the ass

This is good copy pasta

I thought Snuff was Elite? Loosing to DeadCo??

Insto-gratifaco crowd is here, thats why all PVE ships have to die within 10seconds of an elite pvper wanting to hunt them.

That's gonna be a yikes from me dawg

So 200 vs 80 and yet darkness didn't kill the cita?
---
Damn. Was hoping it was streaming again.

You should split it between various people in CCP for better effect
---
gf see ya next round 
---
One of the few, my smart friend. I started playing eve 2 months ago and shortly after got the stargate itch. Absolutely love this show
---
Where they trying to kill nullsec ?
---
lol rekt
---
I couldn't be unhappy with that, Farscape died and the two main characters just walked right into the biggest Sci-fi show on the market and kept going.
---
She was? Since when?
---
The issue is that as soon as you make subcaps be able to fight off supers without caps then you will see it being abused where you see a fleet of these cheap subcaps be able to destroy significantly more expensive capitols. 
---
It is nearly at this point with dreads after insurance, people want to nerf the fax out of existence so dreadbombs can/will kill supers regardless of mistakes made by either side and faxes used. 
---
Look at the recent dreadbombs on NC by both snuff and PGL, both within NC super umbrella and both had similar numbers if not pgl had more.  Snuff didn't make mistakes and NC did and paid the price for it even with faxes and due to the sub cap advantage was able to extract a Significant amount of caps. 
---
Pgl's dread bomb was mistake ridden, trickling in dreads missing out on alpha, cynos being lit everywhere and anywhere because the cynos kept getting popped (another reason why invincible cynos are broken) and even then we still came very close to loosing a few supers

I think you missed what we were doing there.  For GF's.  Not to kill the cita.  Why would you kill it if its just going to provide killmails for us.

Okay, thanks for the explanation
---
Thanks. What about "GTFO"?
---
wow great shots! Fight was fun
---
the salt, nice :)
---
That’s what you think. 
---
Thats exactly what I had in mind. If you d needa gate caps, ofc you needa fight over grid-control on both sides, if its a contested maneuver =&gt; Yay! Combat!
---
In my very personal opinion capitals shouldnt be stuff that should be able to get moved over regions in a glimpse. Yeah, I m aware that d be a kick in the nuts for current meta, I m sorry. ;)
---
&gt; That is not for either of us to say. Passing judgment on other people's playstyle like this isn't a good look either. This is the hill you wish to die upon?
---
What playstyle ? This is not playing therefore not a playstyle because these are not players. they are just mobs established via account creation and often, though of course not always, skill injectors.
---
I never said that the bots / multiboxers / shit is a new phenomena. In fact I specifically stated that it isn't, you need to L2 read. 
---
What I did state is that it has not been as widespread and not the status quo which it is today. And that holds very true. We have continuously dropping number of active players that is being artificially padded, replaced by, multiboxing and / or bot accounts and I stand by this.
---
Maybe if they had put really any features into it beyond looking cool...

Yeah it can be annoying at first, especially for those of us that have been around for a while.

I'm pretty happy with the new screen I got 10 days ago :)
---
More please
---
"more options" means enabling more players to actively participate on an actually meaningful level, while I do agree with you that having 90 would be way too much and out of whack, having 10 or so would be awesome.
---
Seems like every time a VNI dies or someone docks up when a nuet enters local or they are out bid by .01 ISK it must be a bot.
---
what about nerving resources... if you mine to much or to many persons the constelation will run out of resources. (won't hurt the little miner, but you won't see bazillions of rorquals in one system, they have to spread out more)
---
That was a lot of fun. Many thanks for bringing the content Snuff!
---
Very little has changed re-sig tanking.  You are just realizing that Sig tanking was grid-based speed tanking, which has been replaced by grid-based agility tanking.

and which one of those is the reason you find it fun?

Yes/no? You can make a lot of ISK from these, if you kill them and scoop the loot. On the flip side you can lose a lot if you die!

Regardless of that, it’s fun!

You know, one thing that might help out is if they had a second testing server(not the entire galaxy, as that would be quite an investment for this.) you realistically only need a few systems to do this.  Then, on said test server, do balances and changes daily or weekly and actually test them.  This sort of continual testing could be the games saving grace.  In other games, Rust and to an extent Dota both come to mind, there is balancing and updates that happen on a weekly(or sometimes longer) basis but they are frequent enough that mistakes can be fixed.  Now considering EVE is much more serious and has much more time and money invested into it, it would not be wise to push those to the full release every time, so a frequently updated test server might be the way to go for that one.  I am by no means a professional and I have no real standing in the community aside from simply being in it, so I don't expect this to make it very far, but it's an idea.  And I am throwing it out there.  So that's all I got to say.  About that.
---
because people want to play for free.
---
without putting any effort in.
---
But with multiple fax, if they cyno up then they cannot Panic and you focus damage onto it. Some high DPS ships will be able to burn through a torque relatively quick.
---
 And once/if rorqs lose there current relatively untouchable state then more will roam specificly looking for them.
---
That's the point though. People aren't looking to spend real cash on PLEX so they can turn it into piles of ISK. They're complaining about having to earn piles of ISK just to keep playing.

Maybe so but Logi getting credit for kills would be amazing and really promote different play styles.

How the hell is that titan alive, gotg step up your game
---
Yeah definitely a shame that they got removed. I haven't watched AT since eve-bet got removed.  Such a shame that a minority ruined it for others
---
Dodge the boson makes that hard u guys could have had 3 titan kills if you around. 
---
Yeah, I think lowsec would probably end badly for us :)

If you ask nicely they usually let you through.

This is a good post Mukk. For me a lot of what wasn’t addressed is the bleed over of subcap engagement abilities and tools to capitals. The addition of HAW’s, NSA and how it combined with support fighters allow for carriers to have no negative choice in fitting... there are actually a lot of options. The idea that I think needs to be brought back into the spotlight is that capitals should require subcap assistance to be effective against subcaps. XL guns with 99% webs, carriers with webbing/pointing alts or mids with tackle/sebo’s instead of full application mods. Support fighters are pretty bonked overall.
---
As far as FAX go, reducing the tank bonus of both resist and active rep varieties, and reducing the effectiveness of EHE on FAX. 
---
There are a ton of changes that can be made to bring caps in line or more fun for both the cap pilots and for the players playing against the caps. 
---
Thank you for coming, fun was had. See you next time, gf.
---
lol will try that next time
---
auto pos guns were never a big deal unless you were in a solo bomber tackling something on a JB or if you warped into a pos bait cyno. They were powerful when manned but did almost nothing to fleets except annoying people
---
Did you disagree with me!? BOT! THERE'S A BOT! CCP WHY! EVE IS DEAD
---
Snuff still bad. Can only defeat NC.
---
You should probably be buying and fitting feroxes in increments of ten tbh
---
Why weren't you in a super, you could have tanked them
---
In my high-grade halo Thalia I get like two from each site it's crazy.

One thing eve taught me that's viable for work, call discipline.

Didn't really brag. I just brought up the question of why people are so willing to slave away on a game that is meant to be fun just to pay for their subs.

Its a special type of doomsday module for titans that teleports the victims from one part of the solar system to another.
---
I know I'm biting the bait but it really annoys me how any time people suggest changes you're somewhere in the comment thread saying "well if you look at it this way these changes ACTUALLY benefit goons so why are you even advocating for them, just keep the status quo as it is"
---
I've seen it on proposals for rorqual nerfs, fax nerfs, cyno nerfs, citadel nerfs, and probably a whole bunch of others. 
---
Let me be clear that anything that drives conflict is good thing. Your alliance "descending on eve like a locust swarm" sounds like a ton of fun for you and everyone else. It's almost like making citadels actually worth killing would give you guys a reason to play the game beyond krabbing in complete safety. Hell, it might even make the rest of eve blob up like you also tend to advocate for. 
---
fucking LOL

she teleports out as soon as you activate the cruise missiles the first time you see her, but the second time it should work. However if you use an arty mach you can double dip on the bounty and get the +3 implant.

CCP would not allow it there is a software that allows you to do this http://i.imgur.com/it4aMsm.png it more or less lets your capture screen regions and display on other clients or a new blank client. it was great for multiboxing but CCP put a stop to it shortly after they "stopped" input broadcasting.
---
&gt; What playstyle ? This is not playing therefore not a playstyle because these are not players. they are just mobs established via account creation and often, though of course not always, skill injectors.
---
You are doing it again. Just because you consider their playstyle degenerate doesn't make them less of players.
---
&gt;I never said that the bots / multiboxers / shit is a new phenomena. In fact I specifically stated that it isn't, you need to L2 read.
---
&gt;What I did state is that it has not been as widespread and not the status quo which it is today.
---
What you said was "back in my day it wasn't a problem."
---
I wonder how one would go about solving it. Maybe one could use machine learning.  One could build models using data from known bots. What I can't figure out is what kind of data would be needed. 
---
Antifa isn't just a reaction to fascism. Antifa are communist, and not the 'grr commie' right wing kind of way, I mean actual literal communism.
---
If you don't believe me, you can go to an Antifa rally and look around, or you might be interested to know that early versions of Antifa in Germany were directly funded by the Stasi of East Germany.  
---
And yeah considering that both ideologies killed millions of people, and both groups are violent morons, I think we can equivalate the two.

This isn't a troll comment, I genuinely want to know. Last time I heard about proud boys it was some cringe video of an initiation ritual where they ask you to name off cereal brands or some shit while being hit. Gavin McInnes made it I assumed as some sort of weird publicity stunt/edgy political LARPing group. Now I see people acting like they're the Hitler Youth. So maybe I'm out of the loop but can you link me to some stuff about violent acts/vandalism that Proud Boys actually did? when I look into it all I hear is he said/she said. Is there reporting/police report, that sort of thing, about actual incidents?
---
The weird thing is there aren't even ads as far as I can tell.    Idgi.  
---
can you just be cool man, this is a sub for a video game lmao
---
Yes that's probably the reason.....

Repost with BR

The more time I spend in Wormhole space with the game’s default sound/music on, the more I’m convinced Eve is secretly a horror game. D-scan sounds like a deep, scary heartbeat, and the music is just eerie. Fun stuff. :)

Mmm, delicious carebear tears.

It's the closest thing to achievements EVE will ever have. If and when I have time to start playing it again, filling out the Activity Tracker is going to be one of my goals :D

For anyone who hasn't read Templar one, it's actually very good

An idea that doesn't come down to "spam more cheap disposable ships" and gives expensive, worth-hunting-for stuff both solid use and actual risk. That's one of more reasonable ideas I've seen.
---
I'm guessing covert cyno mechanics stay as they are, so - ignore any kind of cyno inhibition? That'd allow people to bridge in T3s or Stratioses directly under inhib, which might actually be fun thing to see being used (both defensively and offensively).
---
Sorry, you’re shit. 😉

No bubba. Rip off the bandaid.

I mean, she said it's a fair cop.

Not British but it sounded to me like she wasn't admitting to being a witch, just that the process was fair enough so v0v

And why would you want to do that? Maybe it's just me, but I think if you aim to attack a capital ship, you should expect to face a capital response.

Terrible comment without further elaboration.

1. Have alphas in cargo expanded gnosis ready to dump next to rf'd depot
---
2. Alarm clock and blow it up
---
3. Loot excavators and put them in hostile citadel using upwell cargo deposit
---
4. Firesale or asset safety them
---
5. Profit!
---
Yup. I see nothing out of balance with covert cynoes.
---
Actually, my point was, the more valuable and powerful a ship, the more its loss should hurt. If a T3C loss costs SP to its pilot, a super loss should cost that also. I think, what you just said makes my argument stronger.
---
We'll drink a round in honor of you and your birthday.
---
If you’re trying to krab this is what id do.
---
- find dead Ls/NS region
---
-Have cyno/scan/drifter tackle alt
---
-look for quiet Enpty C5’s
---
-Cyno Your naglfar onto the wormhole
---
-Use smart bombs to kill the cyno and pod him back to get an interceptor and meet you (you should have scanning/ drifter tackle ships /PVP maledictions &amp; a cloaky interdictioned blueloot hauling tengu. &amp; maybe a rolling typhoon).
---
- Roll all your connections Except the Entrence. Keep your eyes on the other side while you’re krabbing. You’ll see when wormhole corps get in local is when you should consider laying low.
---
- Do all the sites (pull alt to tackle drifter)
---
-Cyno your 10Bil in blueloot to the nearest NPC buy station.
---
-Profit
---
&gt;Antifa isn't just a reaction to fascism. Antifa are communist, and not the 'grr commie' right wing kind of way, I mean actual literal communism.
---
1. Antifa isn't a reaction to fascism, its a proactive effort against it.
---
2. Antifa is an umbrella term used to describe the people who are against fascism (since the term is literally antifastische action). This includes communists, but also anarchists, social democrats, some liberals, and so on. Its a leftist political bloc, but it is not necessarily communist.
---
&gt;or you might be interested to know that early versions of Antifa in Germany were directly funded by the Stasi of East Germany.
---
You're falling for some hard right-wing propaganda. Original Antifa movements originated in Weimar Germany during the paramilitary street fighting that happened during that time. They were affiliated first with the KPD, but broad-based antifascist movements such as the Iron Front and others who fell under a broad anti-fascist label.
---
Also, if you're going to talk about how East Germany/Stasi funded antifascist efforts, you might also want to consider the climate in Germany post-WW2. Very few Nazis went to prison, even in the higher ranks. The SS formed their own pensioner's/veteran's league (HIAG), which had thousands of members some of whom served in the West German military post-WW2. In the 1960s, German students engaged in mass protest and political violence in part inspired by the fact that Germany had not come to terms with much of its Nazi past.
---
&gt;And yeah considering that both ideologies killed millions of people, and both groups are violent morons, I think we can equate the two when it comes to Nazis and Communists
---
Not even close.
---
Tell that to GOTG and their northern allies.
---
It's a fair cop means that you're caught doing something wrong and you know you're guilty.
---
Way more. Numbers obviously help, and in a situation where you have mirror fleets numbers create an obvious advantage...but beyond that numbers are not the end all be all in sub cap combat. There is just way to many variables on the table in these fights (which should go without saying due to the sheer volume of ships available.)  
---
Fleet Maneuvering is one of the big "skill checks" in taking that step from being an FC to being a good FC. This is one of the biggest reasons why Good FCs can take out a group of Spartans against a pile of nerds led by a generic FC and walk away with a W, sweet frags and egos.  
---
The biggest issue imho with subcaps is that CCP destroyed the old HAC &lt; BC &lt; BS &lt;  HAC balance that kept the variety of these engagements healthy. Its gone, and probably wont ever come back. This of course was doubled down on by Drones as a legit weapons platform, essentially turning fleet engagements into fleet dancing while groups of drones snipe stragglers and lower SP dude from fleets with near perfect applications most of the time.  
---
So ya Subcap fleet combat is static these days, and largely unfun...but so is everything else in EVE except min maxing dank ticks or spod harvests.
---
Was always funny to see the random frig blap on your KB when they wandered too close.
---
Came here to say this.
---
Best gif/meme/video in a while.
---
that could be fair if rorqual actually was a industrial mothership instead of a t3 barge with insane tank .
---
You do know that CCP devs don't play their game right? They probably don't even know what a kill mail is.
---
Boosh Ravens work once, when you don't expect them. They are easily countered.
---
Well... Give a few seconds for ppl pointing out who is the cyno, then add the abysmal lock-time for BSes... That cyno might actually go through there ;)
---
Balancing with cost, you say?
---
Thats the point: There ll be NO jump-capable ships anymore. And I d like it.
---
Stop making sense. There's no room for that here. 
---
Wh eviction they killed all the shuttles that dropped
---
If I had a penny for each of these threads....
---
Probability, it’s possible to go 10 years without an escalation. 
---
The rates haven’t changed and flying smaller ships does nothing. You’re just having bad luck. 
---
my bad, sorry.
---
Imagine nullsec weebs then.
---
You sir are correct about the old and new PvE, however, it is worth pointing out that the old PvE does not require a lot of or huge time / resource intensive changes. A total effect of really small accumulated changes can work very well in these, in fact let me give you some examples that I have seen on here (reddit), as well as the official forums and even several alliance boards. Thei quantities and somantics do vary a bit but the main things remain the same. Also, PvE needs to encompass combat, mining and explo.
---
So here are some things I have seen that would work well enough to make a dent but are not very work / resource intensive:
---
1. Vary respawn times and locations of anoms, this includes all 3 types, combat, mining, explo and generated by either server (such as DED sites etc.) as well as agent missions. You don't even need to vary it a lot, just incrimental, small changes will do.
---
2. Impliment a random spawn that will respectively contain some webs, tackle, ewar, etc. that will be relatively easy for players to deal with. Again, doesn't have to be each and every time, just random intervals. Make the spawn tackle appropriate to mission / anom mobs, if its a cap size anom then spawn some HICs, DICs, if sub cap then scrams, webs, painters.
---
3. Drop more loot and reduce bounties, and by loot it can be something like overseer's thingies. This will make things more interesting and add more and another gameplay layer at the same time. It makes no sense whatsoever to receive Concord Bounties in areas of the game where Concord has no presence anyways.
---
4. Limit ship sizes some more, so that anoms that were meant to be completed in a fleet, actually are.
---
5. Make a mini game or captcha once in a while on PvE agents which would be activated once in a while. If you fail it, take an agent standing hit. This is not PvP, the half a minute necessary to complete this will have no impact on the needs of PvP and immediate response. While bots such as those running hauling and combat missions would be affected.
---
Stuff like this you can find in a lot of places, a lot of it is not heavy resource intensive and while it will not solve the issue, it would make a difference especially considering cumulative effects.
---
&gt;So maybe I'm out of the loop but can you link me to some stuff about violent acts/vandalism that Proud Boys actually did?

not even 10b destroyed, is this really woth a reddit post?
---
I miss the og svipul
---
I would like to add something. To me it seems that there are not enough ways in the game to actively "inturrapt" a cyno. That is a large chunk of what is missing in the current cyno mechanics.
---
I can sum it up in one sentence.  
---
Eve went from "fly safe" to "mine a lot"
---
Well u want to travel like 3 days to get somewhere sure I don’t 
---
Yes, cuz Scourge post in local message that ppl who can create won fight with more then 50% are trash literally. 
---
But it seems that they have a huge problem with self-concept.
---
Oh neat someone pressed f1 on a cit and blew up some lokis. Check it out, guys.
---
My issue isn't the low amount of a isk involved its more the linking of a killreport and no other info
---
T2 blueprints 
---
What?
---
They are playing the game though. Their required inputs to interact with the game in that manner is very low, probably too low and needs to be adjusted upwards but they still are playing. You just don't like it is whats happening here.
---
Great fight! First big drop for most of the VO pilots. 
---
Much fun was had!!
---
Why are people so obsessed with 'fixing' marauders when they have their niche and they perform it fine. They suffer because of their price and how they are outperformed by much cheaper ships (eg carriers). None of these retarded fixes will want to make someone take a marauder into nullsec.
---
I like the targeted anti-cyno module idea. Not sure making it blops-exclusive is the right approach though. Really any ship that can fit a cyno should be able to fit an anti-cyno, then let the interaction between spool, tank, and target determine the viability. But it's a really good idea, because counters are always better than nerfs imo.
---
Except for fighter application. Nerf fighter application.
---
GTFO is an absolutely retarded mechanic once you factor in the way TiDi interacts with structure timers.  It should not be a free win when it takes the entire timer for the GTFO'd fleet to warp back in, because only one mechanic is affected by the TiDi.
---
Yes
---
I have been told that blops can bridge to any type of cyno. I have not tested it myself.
---
AAR from SFAQL perspective: 
---
No Forks Given[SPORK] had been trying to clean out a bunch of random trash citadels in the area when they ran into a Domain Research and Mining One. Figuring Domain would drop caps to defend it we, amarr lowsec people, prepared a trap. 
---
On the final timer a battleship fleet of SPORK, WSKY and WRATH hit the field first, engaging with an Armageddon fleet. Domain escalated with two triage, hoping to bait out some dreads. WSKY responded with a couple dreads of their own, prompting Domain to bring in their dread fleet. This was the moment we were waiting for, and the rest of our capitals piled in. Partway through the fight GSF showed up with a hurricane fleet, turning the fight into a good old fashioned three way. Unfortunately the citadel was able to repair during the fighting. 
---
GF's were had. Thanks to Domain for bringing the fight.

---
People are busy burning this at the stake and you're here making moves.  Tell your boss to give you a raise
---
If a mobile depot has been reinforced, it must be repackaged before redeploying to get it to reinforce again 
---
Big blocs can report it, but half the time CCP still doesn't do it.
---
But why 50 ? That is the question. It should be like 5-10 pending ships / fits. 3 even if specialized battleships.
---
How did you do that with the little eve clients? 
---
This isn't really feasible, though.  It is a war front that can escalate to large fights multiple times a day, trying to blame players for not telling you 24H in advance for every fight that MAY escalate is kind of ridiculous.
---
Wow these guys are still mad we wouldn't feed their server wide pick-up dogpile our super fleet lmao
---
Build a bridge and get over it
---
Reinforcement is sometimes used as intended by people exploring in hostile space - you can drop a depot in safe, drop loot there and go back for it next day in something like instawarp ceptor to avoid losing everything to a gatecamp or something. Usually depots aren't worth enough to justify permacamping them for 2 days. Rorquals abusing this mechanic is silly.
---
T20 scandal, led to the CSM being formed...
---
https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/07/arts/07eve.html
---
It really doesn't, it's very reflective of how CCP handles bot reports. They take them and then that's the end of it. 
---
&gt; there aren't really any tools available for players to accurately and consistently prove someone's a bot 
---
If you are able to see corp transactions, it's very easy to find people who are ratting non-stop. CCP doesn't seem to have the option of checking this though so it's up to corp directors/CEOs to tell them.
---
No they aren't. Double this if it becomes difficult to tell them apart from bots. When they are botlike then they absolutely aren't at that point.
---
Its hard to bubblefuck a MJD, but yeah, still wayy too easy to catch and kill
---
When i was new lots of years ago, me and my noob friends decided to go into nullsec with our mining brutix's... Because thats where you find the nice ore, right... We got blown to smithereens and then I got convo'd a few minutes later (prolly after the guy stopped laughing at my fit) he gave me 75mil and apologised for not checking how old my character was... Ahh the days before skill injectors...

They can play, just have to keep their employment a secret.

If they played before they become employees, those chars get frozen.

It's a programm called, EVE-O Preview
---
Next time when you click the translate buttom, click it once more to translate it back to russian, so you can see yourself how cringy it is before you bring it to public.
---
Btw, being mad about someone quite often mean they are doing good.
---
were you the newbro in a venture in Goinard attempting to mine? 
---
I think a lot of the player base were interested in it.  The massive issue was CCP said they would pretty much shut down EVE development for several years to get WIS up and running.  Given this was at a time when EVE was stupidly buggy the player base revolted.
---
I likr the idea of making the widow useful for SOMETHING again. 
---
I'd also like to see Jumpdrives on marauders to let them be some kind of superheavy tackle.
---
You think the problem is only cap vs cap?
---
What about how oppressive the concept of a cyno is to subcaps? People will drop a cap/blops on a cruiser/frig.
---
Thanks for the answer and nice video

Sounds like something a bit would say!!!!!
---
Not even close in the sense that Nazis killed 6 million and Communists killed over 50 million (in more than a dozen countries) if we are being generous here?
---
I'm willing to grant that the Nazis were not really nominally trying to "improve humanity" whilst communism was at least nominally trying that but consequences matter. Why does communism get a pass for its millions dead when Nazism doesn't get a pass for its? It's not consistent. And I think this is a hard sell. Try telling a corpse that his death was for the greater good

should be totally fine to run the missions together and the final blow should not have to dealt by him. Havnt run a lvl 1 mission in years but I would assume they bug out rarely
---
Eve lore is low priority nowadays. Chronicles don't get written, nothing gets progressed besides minor events we can't even see the results of, and stuff just gets implemented with no lore justification.
---
The Drifter attacks gave hope to lore buffs, then it got cut in half and the latter delayed until after Citadels for about 2 billion years, then after that released they just went "OoooOOOOOooo spooky mysterious Triglavians! They're the rivals to the drifters!" With no real justification or even foreshadowing.
---
Wormhole lore is still considered abandoned. Empyrean Age Empire War stuff is a laughing stock both mechanically and lore-wise. NPC and their corps barely get name-dropped when an invention comes in to play, it's always an Empire military science division or Upwell Consortium.
---
Proper roleplayers used to be a major group, that even caused an entire section of null that they favored to be named in their honor- now most Eve roleplayers are of the "I take my Alliance loyalty too seriously" type.
---
The only lore taken seriously now is player lore- and let's not even get started on how *that* is going.
---
I guess you were in the 3% that even turned it on... 
---
He will get the completed mission. I’ve never had mission agents bug out. I’ve run hundreds or thousands of missions run by a character that didn’t actually take the mission now and never had an issue with that. 
---
I've heard of that, but mach is just so good at the mission I've never bothered trying it.

It's legit been years since a group afk camped amamake.

Why would we downvote this? It is hilarious.

I have a much prettier copy at home that I would be willing to donate to a good home 
---
Yep
---
I got 12 chars i skill exctract 10 of them each month making 40 large skill injectors and selling them.
---
40 extractors 16.494 bill
---
Make them into 40 large skill injectors  and sell them for 34.120 bill
---
So a profit of 17.662 bill
---
6000 plex for 12 subs is 22.060 bill
---
So i have to grind 4.399 bill each month for 12 subs which takes me about 8 hours.

Aegis sov was also the devs... stain guy alt spotted.
---
Apparently you don’t remember all the self-righteous posts during SOV changes lol
---
You're not dumb to miss it. One day we might see it return or something like it if they can figure out how to make it more than a resource heavy tech demo.
---
So you whine about antifa supposedly being "communists", defend actual neonazis, and then you're surprised when someone calls *you* a nazi?
---
[Hmm...](https://i.imgur.com/VAujUBj.jpg)
---
That is a shame... With a universe like EVE, and having the PLOT taking a back seat is just sad! :(
---
But then, every time CCP gives us some lore, one asshole just writer down shit in the topic... --"
---
b-but antifa!1! the 50 million!!
---
Reminder that the Soviet Union actively engaged in political purges, the starving of citizens, the holodomor, and all sorts of things. Pretty disgusting that you'd not only support that but brush it aside. 
---
Well said sir o7
---
Killed a bunch of very obvious and very shit bots, got shit at from diplos for killing blues 
---
The sad part is, since he mute half of /r/eve he won't see that much of reply...
---
Yeah the mach would definitely be a better option, but for poor people like me back then who couldn't afford the mach, the scram was the next best thing.
---
&gt;Not even close in the sense that Nazis killed 6 million and Communists killed over 50 million (in more than a dozen countries) if we are being generous here?
---
6 million Jewish people, 150k-1,000k Romani/Sinti people, millions of Slavs between 1941-44, hundreds of thousands of Poles, Yugoslavs, and others, numbering some 14-17 million people. This is on top of launching a war which was responsible for 70 million deaths worldwide as well.
---
&gt;Why does communism get a pass for its millions dead when Nazism doesn't get a pass for its?
---
It doesn't; Stalin, Mao, and many other autocratic and totalitarian communist leaders find little support in modern leftist circles. If you are around leftists at all, most of them will identify as Marxist/Marxist-Leninists, Social Democrats, Anarcho-Communists, etc. You will find very few Stalinists or Maoists these days unless you go hunting for them because they are generally ostracized.
---
There is a whole field of study that is devoted to understanding the Holocaust as an act that cannot and has not been replicated by any other entity in history. Given the scale of the murder, how far outside of its borders Nazi Germany went to murder "undesirables" and so on, there are many academics who seek to understand the Holocaust as a uniquely historical occurrence. It is inarguable that Stalin and others engaged in genocide and political repression, but likening those to the Holocaust is in pretty poor taste. There are additional fields that look into communist genocides and atrocities around the world.
---
Also, I'll reiterate again. **Two of the major tent poles to fascist thought and politics is 1) an monoethnic state and 2) establishment of that state through murder, genocide, and "ethnic cleansing."** You cannot have fascist thought that is not steeped in racialized ideology, while comparatively you can have communist, anarchist, and leftist ideologies that do not pull towards worldwide revolution or class warfare.

If I was the one in charge of the gallows at Nuremberg, I would have told them that I only wished I could pull the lever a second time for each of them.
---
Chinokk goes to Tama?
---
Nah I doubt it would be that complicated. The info is already there. They'd just need to add a new tab in the fleet window and pull all killmails generated in fleet to that
---
Woah where did I defend nazis?  
---
I ASKED about Proud Boys because I was out of the loop when it came to them, I never defended them.
---
We left capital balance to the devs and look where it got us.
---
Also do you ever actually post about EVE or are you just using this sub as a front for your high-strung political schizophrenia?

Something something ualx

this is the exact video that came to my mind when i opened this thread.
---
Nice strawman, sweetie. I never said anything about supporting the soviet union or being a communist.
---
Can you neonazi slimes find someone who isn't a terminal smooth brain to argue against me please?
---
You're not dumb.  I liked it a lot, and friends did too.
---
The problem, is that it wasn't built into something uniquely useful.  Imagine being able to do things like watch station cams on your CQ screens at the trade hubs and watch Jita Burns as it happens, and watch news of breaking events, like when TEST decided to destroy all of the competing fortizars in Perimeter and install the first high-sec keepstar.   Or, mini-game diversions like card games / gambling while you're waiting for your corp-mates to fleet up.  It's easy to imagine games /activities taking place in just the CQ that would attract a lot of players.  Being able to personalize your CQ with screenshots of battles you won, or kill marks, or storing some of those unusual in-game items you received during special events.  The possibilities in the CQ alone are endless.
---
If we could actually leave the CQ and interact with others, the game could open up in more ways than one could imagine.  Eve would be able to attract a lot of players who get tired of being "a spaceship in space" constantly, and want something with more creativity, social interaction, and variety.
---
so many questions, so little answers
---
Mhm. Sure thing, sweetheart. :-)
---
Imagine unironically calling someone sweetie in a political argument.
---
Nice millenialposting, sweaty.
---
Seriously though, do you just come here to push your political views on other people? I looked at your post history and it's almost exclusively politics. Why don't you just **go to a politics sub?**
---
Then make your own gaming company and do it your way.
---
I have no problem with the current capital balance other than Faxes may need a nerf. However, I am not going to tell them how to do their job, as they are the professionals, and we, well, are not. I would hate for Hilmar to show up at my job barking at me trying to tell me how to do my job.
---
i would use CQ and i miss it but i feel like so much of hte game is so much in flux right now that its hard for me to really care about any one thing. id expect it to come back, be left undeveloped again, and then get forgotten about. it seems like they just spend too much time trying to do too many things.

---
Seriously though you want to quote where I defended fucking nazis?  
---
I really feel sorry for you. Looking at your post history, you almost exclusively post politics in here, and when you do post about eve, it's purely negative. You're a walking ball of stress, nerves and neuroses, polluting the thread anywhere you go with complaints and paranoia and pessimism. I can't imagine living like that.
---
where does the loot go 
---
Even easier: when the notification pops up, right click &gt; turn off (for both options)
---
Good
---
Sweetie, if you're going to reply to every single one of my posts two or three times each, can you please make sure your replies aren't terminally stupid? 
---
You raise no points worth discussing and everyone in this thread is dumber for having been exposed to you. This is getting old.
---
#NazBol go home
---
Nope. The data is there, it was under used and would start to hog more dev time. And we all know how much r/eve loves to manage CCP Dev time 😉
---
interesting
---
Actually I'm raising a specific point. This isn't the place for politics. Quit shitting it up with your unsolicited opinion.
---
Pretty bold accusations for someone so triggered that they're rage refreshing a reddit thread and spam replying to every post. :-)
---
You'd have to be doing the same thing in order to recognize that, and respond so quickly yourself.
---
Again, where's this quote where I defended nazis. Are you a serial slanderer, because if you are, why should anyone take you seriously? You never passed up on an opportunity to baselessly call everyone a fucking nazi.
---
I believe they are also either strongly discouraged or outright forbidden from involving themselves in major blocs.
---
In which a sad little alt righty gets systematically shut down and can only cry "t-this isn't a politics sub!1!!" in response.
---
Sad.
---
Well, you're a retard then.

but the whole idea about abyss is for people to die in there.

Seriously though. Best fight we have had in a long while.

With excavators inside it's a bit more than 40mil
---
You realize that is for FRT FCs, right?
---
Maybe read the pings before you shit post?
---
this is your brain on spod
---
Mmm, yes, keep going! Neonazi tears fuel me.
---
How shit is your rorq fit if 5b in excavs is 70% of it’s worth??
---
In major roles I think. Pretty sure they can be line members if they want, but I think they can't be on mic.
---
Just gave me an interesting though on how it would interact with tidi. Would it be 15s in the tidi system or 15s in the non-tidi system. The former would mean you couldn't light ongrid. The latter would make the change irrelevant. 
---
Wow, that scalated quickly
---
&gt; I'm gonna fuckin' tickle your nose hairs with my fuckin' shoe.
---
Hmm, maybe that's it. I knew there were some extra caveats stacked on top there.
---
I think you're an actual paranoid schizophrenic so I'm going to just stop here and wish you a nice rest of your day.
---
but then he'd have to press more than 2 buttons, can't have that
---
While I applaud the attempt to make the marauders relevant, the task of TRUE interdiction should go to the interdiction cruisers. Just make another script for the existing interdiction module, to go along with the scram and disrupt scripts already out there. .
---
For me personally, when i've mentioned this idea, its not to "fix" marauders. Its to expand their roles through the use of specialized marauder "modules" (i.e Bastion). So instead of only Bastion, the idea is to expand on what is currently available to the marauder and provide it with several roles.
---
Current Bastion = PVE boi/solo pvp max tank brawling fits
---
T2 Bastion (or a new module that does the same) = Cyno inhib+more resists while removing the gun range bonuses
---
Point Defense Module = kills fighters (this is just spit balling an idea and in no way something i've put thought into and doubt it would ever happen, but just an example of way to have different roles for a Marauder but setup through modules). You couldn't have a T2 bastion and the Point defense at the same time for example.
---
To play devil's advocate and provide anecdotal evidence/scenarios, a Marauder with either a separate module for cyno inhib (like a T2 bastion, or a new module altogether) can be quite a bit faster than setting up an inhib.
---
Many times i've gone out with our gang to kill a capital, with 10-15 guys. We normally end up either 1, forgetting a cyno inhib, or having to spam them everywhere because a carrier slowly wittles it down.
---
Most of the time when hunting, we are 3-5j away from our entry point. So having just a couple dudes on field to distract the carrier/rorq until the marauder lands and insta-jams cyno's wouldn't be a difficult prospect.
---
No one is going to be roaming 30j with a cyno inhib marauder and going through bubbles in this scenario.
---
Having something that can arrive on field and immediately prevent cyno's (but be a focus on enemy damage, essentially acting like a tank in other MMO's) would be very useful as a way to prevent someone from opening the cyno while the inhib is onlining and just perma-cycling the cyno until they can get a response fleet setup.
---
Sure, they can light cyno before the marauder goes into bastion, but its a lot different from them seeing an inhib go down and seeing the green circle appear as an indicator. Whereas if you warp a group of 5-10 dudes on-top of them, its harder for them to recognize the marauder immediately and since bastion is instant, would be alot easier to block cyno's than waiting for an inhib. Obviously it comes at a cost of the marauder and that you're a sitting duck. You could then do initial tackle with marauder, and also lay down an inhib so the marauder can go in and out of bastion as needed to hold tackle or escape if things start to escalate.
---
Combine this with ascendancy's and/or hyperspatial rigs and you could get a pretty fast warping marauder to make this even quicker. 
---
Wow, big words from a little kid. Am I supposed to cry now? Come back when you actually have a legitimate argument.
---
Oh no, challenging game play has sprouted up, better start asking for it to be nerfed.
---
PI
---
hehehehehhehe
---
oh i'll fill it out =D
---
Yeah makes sense, would be pretty cool because you are sacrificing to get that inhibition. I only say this because with every capital balance thread there is a marauder suggestion thread :) And each suggestion is usually OP as fuck or literally shoehorning features onto a class that isn't compatiable.
---
You could "soft immobilize" effect similar to what burst projector has - unable to warp, take gate, jump out, bridge out, take wormhole or cloak up without affecting subwarp agility/velocity, basically making it stuck on grid until module cycles down. And from far enough there's still risk of said blops being volleyed by likes of arty Ragnarok or beam Avatar (which takes a lot to set up properly if cynojam effect is 400+km wide).
