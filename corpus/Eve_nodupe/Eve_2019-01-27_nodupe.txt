no weapons timer in PVE

You see what happens when you get out of your vehicle, but it's not the real police.
---
No. PANFAM were forming to defend an Azbel, PGL cried on the meta show saying he didn't want to fight on that grid after all, PANFAM wanted content so they warped to KS trying to provoke a fight
---
Create a character first, just like you would in any other mmo.
---
Same,  every fucking time
---
I had one of those mid-grade snake implants drop from a rat that killed while mining. Usually don’t check those wrecks but now I always have a MTU posted up pulling stuff in Incase something good is there. 
---
Ok first I’ve never played an mmo game of any sort and second is thee supposed to be a button for that too? There is a place where I can create and manage accounts, but nothing else. I’m sorry for my idiocy
---
You are outnumbered by whom, Olds? Lols, i've head rumors you can't even undock from NPC station which is camped by the Olds  unless Garst is online. TRI strong :)
---
My basis is that it's not a problem. There are ways to recover sec status already in the game which require people to be undocked and potential content drivers. 
---

---
An example of a better change would be to move the wcs check in fw plexes from the gate to the timer itself, thus unfucking gate sliding while also removing stabs from all plexes not just the 3 gated sizes.
---
why can't I be both?
---
There's covert propaganda and then there's this.
---
Did you download the launcher?
---
Test is having a bad new year
---
I'm currently the ceo of Amarrian State. Previously I founded Dirt 'n' Glitter and before that was a member of Fweddit during thier time in Amarr fw. Non of which brought up sec status as an issue whilst I was with them. If anything we are happy the be those flashy red baddies.

Winning eve. Man what a champion

I went to steam searched EVE Online and got the the one that looked like the game. Is there multiple things I have to download?

People have haulers not in NPC corp?
---
While we're talking about repairs and drones... How about letting the ship repper slowly patch up your drones in the bay?
---
It's silly having to deploy repair drones or using remote reps to patch them up after a fight. Or sitting at a Citadel and letting the repair ray slowly mend them. 
---
because this is a pvp game? 
---
You know you can rearrange the sidebar and add and remove things from it at will right?
---
afaik steam launches the game through eve launcher these days.
---
But not 100% on that.
---
r/woooosh
---
Join goons, it's the only way.
---

---
Bots recall drones dumbass. Not sit there and keep mining.
---
That might make ships like the Ishtar relevant again.
---
you do apparently 
---
Agreed the RNG is garbage but I still love seeing officer mods turned into t1 trash tho.
---
One of the things you could do, particularly with solo or small gang pvp would be to look at how old a character was, and that would give you a generic idea of how skilled they were likely to be. 
---
A week old character in a Vexor was definitely less of a threat than a five year old character in the same ship. That's largely gone with the ability to skill into anything with enough RL cash.
---
 It's also massively contributed to the overwhelming meta of maximum supercapitals and caps that now (arguably) stifle and dominate null and lowsec.  
---
Earlier, groups like PL could make up for significantly less actual players by flying very skill intensive ships, and being able to field more Supers and Titans than any other group could bring to bear. 
---
Other groups simply didn't have the older characters required to field so many of those ships, especially with them being much more expensive. 
---
As we are now, a player can skill into a number of supers relatively quickly, with Rorquals being as they are now (rather than a system wide booster) money for null groups is meaningless, players can use that money to skill inject more and more until they can fly everything, especially Titans and supers. 
---
I'm sure its good for CCP, but it has totally transformed the game, imo for the worse

Jesus that's what you're worried about? Idk what wz you're in but I have seen 0 farmers with WCS in a plex, large or otherwise, since the change, and I've also heard no complaints about not having magical immunity to points if you spam the gate button hard enough. You could've gone with citadels, LP store balance etc. etc. Any number of the issues plaguing FW and you went with the one favor CCP did us this year. Talk about a waste of dev time.
---
Yes I agree, it sounds worse.  When they announced skill injectors I lost interest in the game.  Reading this makes me not so eager to come back.
---
Recovering sec status via ratting is far more time consuming than it is to lose. You are promoting people to warp away from fights if they know it’s a neutral instead of fighting which is exactly what your against from the sounds of it. Defensive plexing larges with wcs hasn’t been something i have seen many complaints about as there are far more afk profitable things to do than that so I would hardly call that an immediate concern however I do admit would be an easy change
---
The game can still be fun with the right group, but it really depends on what you want from EvE right now. 
---
I hope CCP can 'fix something' or I think we are very close to the end game of EvE
---
Jame 315 was right all along.
---
You're gonna need to hop on discord and find a patient mentor if you wanna give this game a chance. 
---
Kind of.  they were being manufactured from parts bought from firesales from the maila keepstar.
---
Ok so that explains it, if you were in a group that had more people or did anything with the general militia (whether those be public fleets or just chatting in militia) you would have heard it brought up. 
---
FW is plagued with so many problems, however this is a small QoL problem which if fixed wouldn’t affect a single person other than those enlisted in FW. I’m not sure if you’re completely against this idea, or is it something you think require so much work that it’s unthinkable? 
---
&gt; I think we are very close to the end game of EvE

Earlier this morning we found a pile (and I do mean PILE0 of hangar containers just... sitting in space, in the C2 connected to our home hole. Turns out someone had unanchored some structure in a dedicated PI hole or something. We spent the next 2 hours gleefully looting the 50+ cans that had shit in them and launching/destroying the 150 T1 ships that popped. https://zkillboard.com/related/31000415/201901261500/

Google “Eve account management” that’s the web based account info where you control your subscription/buy plex etc. Download eveonline, run the launcher, make a char.

Depending on your goals, I know that dread ratting doesn't sound bad to me lol. But yeah basically, wh sites do not respawn the way nulsec sites do... you can easily do all the sites in your home hole and run out of stuff to do. Wh corps will roll their static holes until they find a decent hole to farm, then roll everything in there and farm it. But its a bit of work, and it may take a bit to find a farm hole etc. You can def make bank dont get me wrong

---
If the citadel has the BPOs in research/build when killed they are able to drop.
---
I dont get it they abandoned that shit because they moved south and could careless about wasting isk to protect it.  
---
I guess when you need a morale victory anything will do.  
---
The fuck are you smoking?  Monochrome neocom is still widely regarded as one of the worst UI changes in the history of...anything.
---
I agree. It's ridiculous that you're fighting for the State and they call you criminal when you get into Jita because neutrals (more than Gallente or Minmatar militians) get into a FW plex you're capturing. They didn't enter to say hello. Militians accept that in the enemy empires you're not welcome, but in your own empire... do not makes sense.

Tbf, while pred is a major shit lord, I have to agree with you on your smug post here. It's pretty damned sad and gay for Erre to always call half of new eden anytime he wants to fight someone basically GUARANTEEING he will get absolutely no fight. I'm pretty sure erre is actually scared of Pvp and just wants to be the area's snuffbox accept he can't do it himself, so he calls everyone and their mama's baby brother's sister's cousin's roommate's next door neighbor and their cat. It's really fucking disgusting. Grow some fucking balls erre!! 
---
No wonder why the system is laggy as fuck
---
That was my point.
---
When you tether, it reps your ship, your modules, and your drones.
---
So why not let us run our local rep and also have it slowly repair the drones too. It won't be super speedy or anything, but it'll keep you in the fight longer if your drones mend while recalled. Or save you from having to sit with drones deployed using RR and more rep drones to match the damaged ones.

Anyone trying to tell you these changes have any real effect on actual sov influence gamewide is kidding themselves. Here's [today's coalition map](https://www.verite.space/maps/coalition/coalitioninfluence.png). The source of coalition members isn't well maintained anymore so to be clear GOTG/Panfam and Legacy/Imperium are the same teams when it comes to geopolitics, "Galmilistan" are now Legacy members, and every group marked as "neutral states" are either honorary members of vassals of the larger group next to them.
---
The real changes are quite simple: 1) The intensity of control any group has within its sphere of influence has increased immensely due to jump fatigue, and 2) about 2/3rds the number of people play the game so there's a ton of empty space (see: most of skill u's sov)
---
I was told to be colorblind, though.  Wasn't CCP just helping by making it all black and white?
---
Why be Near2 ur pc when you bot and be Far.

I actually didn't know that. But that makes it even less sensible to change the position of existing items - if people want the agency up there they can move it themselves.
---
A year's PLEX is 20 billion ISK. A year's access to James 315 territory is merely 10 million ISK. The only way to live well in highsec is to obey the Code, so the permit is worth the extra investment.

---
Station trading is the realm of rich veteran players with a strong understanding of the economy, the manufacturing tree, and the politics that influence supply and demand. As a newbie you'd be better off doing some planetary production for extra ISK, and to spend the rest of your time playing EVE to get experience.

Are you aware that you joined Frat renters?
---
It is an unfair advantage. It should be banable. 
---
It reads "OR provide you any kind of unfair benefit/advantage."
---
It 100% gives players who are doing PVE an unfair advantage over PVP ers who are hunting them. You should not be able to use a 3rd party program to alert you with audio that someone is coming 3j out when you are alt tabbed out the game.

Its against the EULA.

Honestly making it so you could only have 1 active rorq per grid might not be bad it's not the rorqs themselves that are really the problem it is as you said the cap umbrella. This would either force people to expand out or use other miners

---
all near2 does is read a log generated by the actions of actual players sitting at their computer. CCP has said multiple times this program and types like it that read OUTPUT are not bannable (they do not modify input) because any player can use them (all clients have logging!), therefore it is not an unfair advantage. 
---
Aight, so the fuck is that fit?
---
Ahhh yeah you must be a lawyer in real life.

No unfair advantage there. I can see that now. Yes. Very fair and level playing field there. Silly me.

Sorry I don't want to give away my unfair advantage to you. I want to kill them dam excavators when you go to poo. 
---
The idea was that I'd become part of, or link up with, some players in the fleet. Then I'd protect the miners, or do incursions with the fleet. So there seemed like there was always something to do!
---
But now I have no battleship I'm in a Venture (the first ORE ship lol) getting down in them rocks, it's quite fun, you make bets on which of the AFK miners will die first lol

Battleships-&gt;Other Battleships-&gt;Amarr-&gt;Paladin preferred

I just followed this for an incursion build tbh
---
Possibly for POS shoots. Fitting a set of Polarized launchers and faction BCUs boosted (maybe still does) a Hound/Nemesis above 1000 DPS. When you are short on numbers, you compensate with expensive fit. What he didnt expect was me in the middle of venal randomly camping a kickout station.
---
Doesn't help that battlecruisers aren't analogous to cruisers IRL to begin with. BCs are a post dreadnought development, and predominantly have similar displacement and armament to dreadnought battleships. But traded armor for engines. 
---
&gt;So there is no basis, and it is nonsensical to suggest that there should exist a class of ships of subcapitals, or tier of battleships that fit capital guns.
---
Why not? Given there's no basis for basically anything going on with ship "classes" in this game in terms of size, and placement relative to other ship classes. Most of it is quite arbitrary. There's nothing stopping them from coming up with some name for a new class of ship as needed. Heck I just say call them monitors if anything. Odds are if something like it were added, it would spend a lot of time siegeing out structures.

it's true we're poor, we're struggling to afford bombs. pls send isk to The Crumb Dumpster so we can buy more bombs. There are needy drones in Delve with no bombs - you can help.
---
You're not just going to be able to walk in null and grab a spot. If you want territory have you be able to take it from someone and hold it. It might only be the shittiest most unwanted spot in null that you can take, but you have to aim low before you can go higher. The "blue donut" doesn't reach every single nook and cranny of null.

That's because people dont trust the dirty minmatar stations not to fall apart. Amarr victor

Sameeee just a few days ago I lost a 2 bil hawk and was literally like.... Already replaced
---
I’ll get the EMT on standby.
---
The problem is that, despite everyone who insists otherwise, isk has always been a balancing factor. Other than very specific places where what you fly determines whether you get a fight you want (i.e., facwar), bringing a more expensive ship &gt; bringing a less expensive ship. Faction gyros make you do more damage. Faction reppers make you live longer. Drugs are good. You can't buy your way into skill, but you can buy injectors to fill in those SP gaps. At the end of the day a good pilot in a shitty ship *can* win against a bad pilot in a good ship; but most pilots aren't all that good. 
---
Y hours today may buy you a bigger ship than it did 5 years ago, but that shrinks the space of effective ships. Many, many ships have been made totally obsolete because their clear upgrades are cheap and everyone can make money. 
---
As for losing hours of krab time when you get popped - many people playing eve have made it their mission to not get popped. Trillions of isk have been devoted towards creating defensive structures that all but ensure that if I'm losing a fight I can be saved, and if I can't be saved - I just won't fight. 
---
At the end of the day, what happened is that people realized losing ships sucks. It's more fun to make the other guy lose his ship. Most people playing most games don't *really* get a kick out of winning an even fight; it's fine just to win. Eve has systematically changed from a game where loss was accepted as a common part of life that couldn't be avoided, to one where losing a ship or a fight just means you needed more friend, bigger ships, and a better intel network.

If a single rorq makes 200mil/hour, it take a day of mining to replace those excavators.
---
Yes. Then I’d strike right after desert when they least expect it.

Really? Shocked there's been no movement towards Power BI Desktop

tapi needs daddy goon to bail them out yet again

gota save that KS somehow...

This is new and exciting.

The other day I killed a t1 tackle frigate that dropped a deadspace neut. Couldn't go back to grab it tho :(
---
Im nit saying its amazing and i dont actively hunt them but i do think theu can be better than a lot of people give them credit for, especially if you are a null industrialist and want to do your own invention its better than importing your datacores. 
---
More than likely if he appears inactive it might be because he doesnt get kills either. 
---
&gt;I use all the damage reduction I can
---
What damage reduction?  You few a no tank paladin.  It has literally the most armor rep/s in a subcap and you fit no tank.
---
At this point what is the advantage to being in Test instead of just joining Goons?
---
Neurologists make a lot but I’m not interested in medical school (should have added that part). I’m headed towards research as a neuroscientist. 
---
Shocking
---
Deer are historically under-represented in the IT industry.
---
BOPE and Hirr surprise me for different reasons.  PVP on easy mode for BOPE I guess, and legacy ties for Hirr?  I thought there was some bad blood between upper echelon members of Hirr and Test. v0v That was nearly 10 years ago I guess.

What difference does it make? The bounty system is utterly pointless and broken, so who cares who holds the top spot?
---
I actually love the lack of effort in both your module placement on all your ships and in the video editing lmao. Amazing video +1.
---
Bless your soul.  If you can't even figure out how to create a character on your own this might not be the game for you.

It’s more representative of what happened to panfam last year.

You get to see more explosions? I think. They just also tend to be more of your own explosions.

Yo dawg, I heard you like icons. So I got you Icons for your Icons.
---
&gt;ture list perspective but in what ways have playstyles changed?  Do people still do the same activities?  Is it less or more safe to mine, rat, pvp, grief, wormhole, explore, live in null, live in lowsec?  Is it less or more profitable to mine, rat,  pvp, grief, wormhole, explore, live in null, live in lowsec?  What do you miss from the game that used to be there?  What do you like now thats fun that didnt exist then?  Are big coalitions still a thing?  Any blue donuts?  Is faction warfare active?  How is manufacturing and the economy?
---
I wants some T1 cruiser action :)
---
I vote he records this action or mods banana him from the sub
---
You have a really good attitude dude.
---
why dont nc and horde just blop test even more with bringing pl too
---
It's just the AFI's and the bastion module, that's all I had as actives. I think the incursion fit just assumes you won't be the recipient of a significant amount of damage so they allocate most of the low slots to dps
---
The only real use of bounties is putting them on your friends so you get a ping when they die
---
:(
---
Cap umbrellas are cool, but they aren't instant. Rorqs make them incredibly strong because they give the cap umbrella an extra 7 minutes to figure out who needs to be in a FAX, sort a cyno to the system if need be, etc. etc.
---
Making it harder for the cap umbrella by requiring a faster response time or more correct steps to get on grid (preventing cyno inhibs, avoiding drag bubbles) are all components of moving away from the intense safety that currently exists.
---
Are you ok?
---
Isn't that what HORDE are doing, calling NC and friends to help fill up ferox fleets?
---
isnt the venture the capital ship?
---
&gt; Legacy vs PanFam
---
  At this point it's only TEST vs PANFAM, but OK.
---
That’s the issue, it’s still downloading. The play button doesn’t appear until it’s done 
---
How you didn't already know is beyond me. :P
---
Two-hour delay before you're made fun of.

If we ever do actually decide to call in the Imperium you might as well pack your bags.  Let's be real, Sort Dragon is the only reason you're not homeless right now.

Used to be a feature on zkill, but then folks had to go adding 300+ characters. I killed it, meaning to temporarily until I put some sane limits onto it, but then never really brought it back... maybe I should... 
---
en24 is a shithole of a website 
---
Then why I haven't learned where the damn market icon is after all these years? I never click the right icon the first time, never.
---
Pity that it's completely wrong.
---
No.
---
plz do :D
---
You've probably been told already by now, and this goes for even being in a corp not at war, but make a tanky travel fit. Switch to that when you move between incursions. You can/will be scanned and ganked if you're too squishy.
---
your site is trash, stop shilling it
---
"Jokes on you we have a new Alderaan ready to go already"
---
Heh you're right, I herpaderped and forgot that in kspace only shit in build drops rather than everything. In that case, damn i wanted those dreads :(
---
I got like some 700mil implant from a Dread Gurista in a Rock Haven. 
---
Usually those drop faction ammo or some 30-50mil faction module. I don't even think I noticed it until after I dumped the loot into station and noticed the isk total amount was way higher than I expected.
---
You realize we were removed from the deal, if Imperium was going to evict us Sort wouldn’t have stopped him. And I’m pretty sure it’s expired for everyone but GotG anyway 
---
So... you could enter one hole twice without exiting that hole. I wonder if you'd get polarized for that? :)
---
the joke  
---
your head 
---
There are a couple of threads about this in the subreddit. The *rumors* I have heard have been that some folks are moving to Curse, and that the Imperium may be pushing out some dying entities to make more room for themselves.
---
So far it has been yes. But from my understanding other alliances that's in Legacy such as Brave, Evictus., etc. has declared war on NC. and Horde. I'd imagine this is to bolster numbers if the Keepstar is contested tomorrow. Which is obviously how it should be, seeing as TEST are fighting against more than one opponent.
---
I did not mean for my comment to sound like I was against that. What I meant was it could've been fun to see PanFam vs Legacy, not only TEST. Afaik Horde and TEST are pretty close when it comes to members, but it seems to me that TEST can form more than Horde. Haven't looked at the numbers for the rest but I'd imagine other Legacy alliances will even the gap at the very least.
---
Once the Imperium starts wardeccing as well it's obviously for a certain highsec timer. Which is meh imo.
---
Hey, send me a message! I’ll be on some tomorrow and I can help get you started. I run a mining/PvE Corp and we’re all about helping new players get into the game.

I know that deposits of P0 Resources move around as you extract them, but does the resource density of a P0 on a specific planet change over time? As in, the number from 0% to 100% on the scan tab of planetary interaction.

OR you have very good logi pilots.  You get plenty of dps slonked on you, but your 6 scimis got your back.  
---
Hopefully. I think this could become fun unless someone throws themselves on either side to tip the scales too much. Good job to TEST for going up to Geminate / Vale(?), fighting alone against a coalition. It only makes sense when now TEST's own assets are in risk, that they call in their own. Let's see o7
---
Warptome does shield tanking with Scimitars and Basilisks logi cruisers for remote shield repair. That's why there's no armor mods on the fit, just shield mods in the mids. It also frees up your lows for tracking computers and heatsinks so you can max out your DPS. Sucks you lost your bling fit. You've got the right attitude by posting this and having fun with it. Replace it with a Nightmare and jump back in fleet.
---
Excuse me RELNT actually joined Horde yesterday.. I think.

No, it was all stuck in paused industry jobs

Gobbins we told you not to post on reddit
---
AFK in a punisher, worked for me (and 500 others)
---
You must be new to eve. CCP is in the business of mentally fucking their players. It’s a test to see how pissed off they can make a player base as they continue to pay for shitty/retarded updates. This can be traced back throughout the years. I think they got out of hand in 2008 yet statistics prove me wrong. I do know this, they had 500k subs around 2013-2014. Wonder how many subs they have today.

Even worse is he is in BSC, op please join any other corp, I'd recommend chatting to Eylon Egnald if USTZ or Mekwell if AUTZ, both are recruiters for Winnie Blues and VB crew, I'll even set up an alt to go do high sec incursions with you if you enjoy that, but nullsec is the good stuff :P
---
Funny enough there was somebody selling it on the goon forums about a year ago. Curious how that worked out for him. 
---
A nightmare is a lot better at more than half the cost too
---
the lowsec keepstars were the only real freeport keepstars
---
&gt;Everyone wants to be the one going "look at these idiots; let em take a little more armor off before you light the cyno." Sure, if that's fun to you, go right ahead. It feels hollow to me.
---
That and nobody wants to look bad or uncool in front of their internet friends, or on a public website like this. Nobody wants the be on the receiving end of a dunk and then have to relive it on reddit with a bunch of pubbies inputting their opinion either, so the result is people flock to naturally large groups where their big, expensive ships are safe, they can krab in peace, and when a ping goes out they get ina doctrine ship, shoot a structure or red dots in a zoomed out screen, get a nice killboard, and if they lose their ship it gets replaced by the alliance. 
---
Space used to be so valuable in its own right. Different stuff in different space. Battles still favored subcaps besides the yearly MAXHYPE. People were way more spread out, and active, and krabbing wasnt the real way you made income, it was moongoo starbases which attracted fights. You didnt just fight over space you fought to nix a groups income so it was more on the line.
---
Lowsec was important and active because you needed to buildstuff there, and you had to travel through a ton. Fw was alive. Alot more action happened since subcaps were more important and not big tois.
---
No bullshit asset safety. You used npc stations to dock your shit. Because of this it was super important to defend your stuff. No afk vnis, you belt ratted. 
---
Everything was more costly to lose and more satisfying to win. Much more players spread and lots of fleets going on of all sizes. Better in general in everyway.
---
I never understood why this isn't a thing already. Logi drones don't repair enough that it could ever be considered game breaking. Maybe blaster ishkur with rep drones?
---
In drone lands you dont want to use 100mn fut. Too much debris will bump your orbit.
---
Go with a 10mn omni-resist active tank.
---
Adaptive innvuln, pith Ctype med booster, large battery, 10mn enduring.
---
4x dda, 2x omni lows.
---
Season rigs with EM and whatever your next lowest resist is.
---
Different drones do different damage, so it's best to omni tank.
---
Orbit structures at 10km and kill web drones first.

Where does that fit in with Vily's post about "2000 Imperial Legacy for the armor timer"?

Wtf
---
It appears there are some really big block alliances which dominate New Eden in terms of economic and military clout. Imperium, TEST, etc.
---
At this stage of the game, what is to stop a couple of the big alliances forming a "Super Alliance", wiping out everyone who opposes them, and therefore basically "winning" eve in so far as eliminating all null sec opposition and monopolizing certain key areas of the economy?
---
Having achieved that, presuming it's actually possible, would this hypothetical "super alliance" be in a position to lobby CCP  for a new server game, i.e. one where every one starts from scratch again? 
---
Essentially: "Well, we won, at last, yah for us, lets do it again!"
---
They bring a lot of warriors. So many warriors that DHSJ declares victory without undocking. Reddit agrees, GF DHSJ you gottem. [Blue Ribbons For Everyone!](https://imgur.com/a/8oalI8y)

A high-grade implant dropping from a Guristas ship. Sold it 630 million.

I bet it would crash if he took a screenshot
---
Despite the size it's not really easy for anybody to move across the galaxy and just win eve like that while defending it from everybody else with the way sov works today. You also can't do the old days of moving an entire super fleet across EVE as fast as you could recharge jump cap so power projection is a serious issue now a days.

A rapid torp fit without a web..

Texas laws states you cannot film CCP employees while they are doing their job. I’m surprised this footage leaked!

Why dis post get gold

I can assure you 50% of goons either bot or input broadcast. Lived in delve for two years. 
---
Test got the advantage of witnessing first hand how PGLs master plan to fight northern supers comes together piece by piece
---
Thats the right answer for hisec incursion travel, he also posted a WTM link above, which is a hisec incursion group. Suppose it could be my fault for not checking that he joined a null alliance, but the name just appeared to be irrelevant, so I didn't bother.
---
do you not think I dont roam? the only place I EVER get a fight out of is like brave newbies space every else (especially delve) its either a fuck ton of rorqs which you cant fight or get a frag and then a bunch of caps show up and then you just pack up and leave 
---
Yes. And we’re still in Geminate, while Test is going back home. 
---
So, I don’t see why you think I’d care. Their deployment was fun while it lasted 
---
TEST.  lol.

madlads

What question was even posed? Go fuck yourself, with your trash Alliance/Corp.

Not to worry. I've built 10 more Feroxes at under Jita sell price :D

and why are you hiding your scores??? :D 
---
&gt; I don’t see why you think I’d care
---
because you're posting here about it.
---
Legacy Official Spokesperson Here; Providence has recently been dropping Carriers on the rare elusive solo battlecruiser player, as you know in the past 2 years this species has become incredibly endangered and is close to extinction, so has become a rare commodity around catch and surrounding regions, and there are several poachers dubbed '2018 capital pilots' who like to mount printed out killmails of a solo battlecruiser that was looking for good fights on their basement wall. When their mother comes downstairs to interrupt them, they point to it and exclaim how elite they are, and tell her to stop bothering them. This is thought to be a religious practice amongst recent capital owners.  
---
Unfortunately, due to extreme overfishing and lack of suitable habitat for these BCs, extreme competition and intra-violence between poachers is occurring, as poaching groups move to take out the competition attempting to take their trophys. TIKLE in particular are such a hunting group that has fallen on hard times recently. Due to their aggressive practices, they have had to resort to hunting smaller game such as [solo GoonSwarm frigates fighting the biggest hardcounter to their ship.](https://zkillboard.com/related/30001168/201901260600/) TIKLE is thought to be the latest causality to 'Spodbrain' a once rare degentrative brain disease that literally causes the brain to smooth, very similar to [Kuru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru_(disease)).

I'm sorry, I have to call bullshit on this one. You are a 3 day old player, in a 5bil ship, in jita, writing a shit post about an alliance you weren't even in for an hour, never came on comms, never came on discord, everything about this screams awoxer.

Your attitude suuuuuucks. Can I never join your alliance?
---
Kills made on Jan 26 hardly count, it's very likely all TIKLE pilots were smashed off their faces and barely capable of flying super capital internet spaceships, much less the much more skill intensive frigates that would have been more appropriate 
---
Please stop posting.
---
Citadels did break a lot of gameplay styles, especially behind the lines BLOPs, DED-runner hunting, casual nullsec roaming, station games fights, and faction warfare. They have increased the QOL in wormhole life, and is the way forward from removing the spaghetti POS code, though, so there's that. They are far from perfect though and still need major tweaks in their killability and reinforcement timers.
---
Hordeling does't know how reddit works. lol

careful, you don't want to beat seraph for the "worst poster" award

TIKLE smashing Provi in the face. I'm proud of you cunts.

Aaaaaaand he's gone. Boy that escalated quickly.
---
Speaking as someone who's never been in Tri, but always respected what they were doing, you must be very new to EVE if you think this is the last you've seen of them.
---
To sum it up this way, Tri basically goes through cycles of existence where they get a bunch of super aggressive PVPers together, burn shit down, piss off too many people, die, then come back a little while later, sometimes with a *completely* different group of corps, and do it all again.
---
I think this might be the 6th or so iteration of Tri we've seen, though honestly I've lost count. Regardless, they'll be back again, just a matter of when.

the public incursion group who takes anyone is one such fountain of wisdom

I'm a goon lol
---
I guess you had to check for active wars. Big oopsy yes :)
---
It's been attempted before, unsuccessfully, by BoB. Even though the balance of power is tilted heavily at the moment, there is very little to gain by conquering all of nullsec, and everyone is well aware it would probably kill the game as it has on Serenity. 
---
&gt;would this hypothetical "super alliance" be in a position to lobby CCP for a new server game, i.e. one where every one starts from scratch again?
---
Owning sov doesn't give you authority over CCP lol, even though people on this sub sometimes forget that.

I used one before I could fly a Vindicator on that toon.  Warp to me was a real scrub outfit at the time, but much has changed in the last 5 years.

Who are you sharing data with for these to work? Because you can share with your corp, do you have to share with others using the app?

Will/can this revel my location to anyone?

as Haidere1988 Northern Coalition. wrote in the thread on the fight tonight
---
"Keepstar has been reinforced, Jita ferox market was fucked, GFs were had. Will come again."
---
Yeah, they go alright, need to get a BS alt set up to do some incursions with them again, I moved the guy I had running with them into doctrine BS alt (since I'm a newbro that mostly flies dictors, so having that BS available is very good) with my nullsec alliance 
---
There is no additional tabs for wallets at the moment. It is something that is requested often by players.   
---
That's a lotta warp ins.
---
Nice call, the fuller their bellies the harder it will be for them to escape. 
---
Black Legion can not accomplish anything outside of Delve. Fixed that for you.

True. Horde would have lost in the same time a single VNI. Tbh, that would have cut down Hordes Tax Income by 100%
---
Darkness bubblefucked all the pipe up to north Deklein yet they still mine with rorqs and exhumers there, even with the constant harassing. Not the smartest people, huh?
---
Good job on killing that bot fleet!
---
You're assuming how a person acted based on Reddit and not in-game. No further comment.
---
LOL a brand new player who was somehow able to afford $1100 USD in skill injectors to get into a paladin and runs to reddit to shitpost an alliance he was in for 1 hour. riiiiiiiiiight, at least now we know who was behind it.
---
So did we. For awhile. It didn't work out, no hard feelings, but I hope you or someone is successful helping him understand a better more sustainable way to EVE.

You could export all transactions into excel and set a pivot table grouped by transaction type like bounties

First week of eve, i'd been given a couple herons in brave and had zero clue what I was doing. A few jumps out of staging (furthest I'd ever been since getting there) I had a large true sansha tower bp drop from a data site. Didn't know what a tower even was until I asked in comms and people lost their minds.
---
I'd rather they remove tether entirely from citadels, and only give it to the new POS replacement FOB structure. The only reason for tether to exist (imo) is so titans can bridge people in the same way that you can by having it inside a POS shield. Once there is an alternative for someone to park their bridging titan on, no reason not to remove it. If you want to safely move caps, you need to have these structures as a temporary base instead of being tethered on a astrahus with 3 timers.   
---
Also would bring back station camping for good fights, bubbling citadels, MJFGing idiots off of them etc. 
---
Lol wow!
---
Had no idea EN24 and/or Twilight Winter was so disliked or something here.  I have no knowledge of any of them or their history, but I sure as hell wont be quoting them anywhere anymore if it gets this hostile and edgy just for a post on Hordes expansion from them.  I guess it's reddit - only for the pros.   "social media". Ouch.   
---
Well. Have fun with it kids.  Some of us past 45 going on 50 cant keep up with this level of hostility. Too harsh for my taste.  Outta here.

Oof. I can't fly my hyperion around anymore fr the same reason. I'm literally always at war. Currently with 87 corps/alliances.

Also, some cans in data sites have a Takhmal item that costs around 80mil. Unfortunately I don't remember the item name, but for that price it's always worth to scan the data sites and take a look at the cans with a cargo scanner.

if you are currently in a group attacking the TTT and have lost access i implore you to speak with your leadership and ask them to come to their senses. 
---
If roaming is dead, and everyone is suddenly extremely risk averse m, I’m really curious what our standing fleet does all the time. Because you pretty much just have to look at the kills happening in geminate to see that people still roam and die in all kinds of ships expensive stuff. 
---
Everyone talking about icons being moved, and here I am with almost none of them in their original locations. 
---
did i post that somewhere? Cause i was thinking at least 2500
---
lmfao
---
I got back to the the game after 3 years like some people over here.
---
Call me strange but I loved to do HQ incursions on HS.
---
But where's everybody? TVP is dead, I don't see the public Russian fleets, nor the German ones either.
---
So... Incursions are over for me?
---
pl were present bumping tapi links and fcs so they couldn't get clean fleet warps
---
bless

Why only dumb people care about kb ?

CVA #1

Lordmopp strikes again.
---
Filthy blobbers
---
Where do you get $1100 usd from? Lol injectors are only 900m, 900m is like $9, 15×9=$135 the paladin is like $40 more and that's not including the free bonus in bundles
---
So I went a little hard on the plex? People go harder on star citizen *sips tea* I also skipped half a year of loading bars for less than half a week's pay *sips more*
---
en24 is simply an awful news site nowadays. We have Imperium News (wether you like it or not coming from Imperium) and New Eden Report to know about relevant stuff. And also, we all know that Horde is now a multicorp alliance, that has been around for some weeks, so nothing new to see here.
---
Require SSO to add a toon to an aggregate view? 
---
I had to look up awoxing, and I know next to nothing about the corp I'm in. Plus I made a few friends last night talking with people, if you go on the alliance discord, public, I'm right there. Crispy0Snake as Graves Rift "can I tag along with someone, just wanna use my battleship to get isk" no one responded so I thought I'd swap to my coercer until someone popped up, like I said, and my ship is destroyed not long after I send that.
---
Why would I want to awox the corp anyway? That'd just sh*t on the other guys in their lil miners. It's a really fair corp imo, and I'm glad it exists
---
My account income is 99.9% selling plex at jita, which is where I bought injectors and the paladin, and left my coercer. Everyone I spoke to last night knows that I'm a new player, and we all got along well
---
Also shitposting is not "I didn't know the small corp I joined was at war" I'm not blaming anyone in the corp for what happened, I'd rather die than cast an emotion over losing ~$40
---
Imagine dying to the provi superfleet in your revenant
---
hahaha how the fuck can you die to cva like wtf hahaha
---
Yes!!! 
---
Guess you've quit by now. 
---
That awkward moment when you die to CVA
---
ah, and now that I finished reading the article, I must reinforce the point of the site being awful because it clearly is lowkey proHorde propaganda, something that shouldn't happen in a NEWS site. Guess Horde needs these newbies!
---
100% not a bot fleet dude
---
tether alliance, wew lad that's a good one.
---
Thanks for clearing that up. I dont know where to find good news about EVE, although I have visited and seen INN, Talking in stations, and a few other sites and podcasts on EVE.  But I haven't found any site that just reports straightforward day to day news on EVE geopolitcs/changes and events.  There was one guy who did weekly YT reports on changes in EVE commenting on the EVE sov changes maps but I think he hasn't posted for a while.   
---
At any rate, like the NC dude I found it funny that we almost emptied Jita of Feroxes at sane prices, that was all.   
---
But sure, I knew Horde was a multicorp alliance already, I just didnt know how many new corps had joined lately, and thought it would be interesting to hear comments about the corps joining or get some insights into who they were, their history and why they joined etc.  EVE geopolitics adds fun to the game and makes it interesting to follow commentary around the game.  But the level of cool necessary here just isnt for an oldtimer like me, I accept that just fine :D  Thanks again. Have a good one. 
---
Warp To Me are a US TZ (i think) incursion group, and there's another big one whose name is currently escaping me
---
I'm still convinced that every person in game and in this sub reddit are an elaborate computer program, or AI hell bent on keeping me from reaching my true potential while I sit in my cave eating tendies and drinking mountain dew. The man cant handle my true autism so it has to keep me distracted. Keep up the good work guys!
---
How/why did this happen? Can someone please ELI5?
---
Nobody gives a shit? Perhaps? Chest beating over blobbing provi jesus what year is this? 
---
DARKNESS can't even krab well
---
First week after mordu ships were introduced. Warp to belt. See strange wreck with loot still inside. I approach and loot it. Orthrus BPC, 800m isk. Thank you, unknown dude that didn't loot the wrkeck.

how much for revenant hull ? just curious btw

Your toy is misbehaving.

It is ok Marshy, we love you and all your different reddit accounts !

Are there 3rd party apps that do this sort of stuff?
---
I'm kinda newish to this but how are bounties pointless and broken? 
---
Sell Revenant to me pls
---
CVA has supers?
---
100b on the km, possibly more though? 
---
CVA Revenant now!
---
nice fit (not)
---
wow avree you're so tough
---
Just form your own alt-corp. Gives you a lot more options for controlling your cash flow.
---
Til ~50 guys with subcap and cap alts (rough numbers in mumble afaik) against a full coalition in their home region = blob
---
As I said, you can follow Imperium News and New Eden Report. The last one haves both website  and youtube channel, and they post here in reddit as well. I prefer INN since they cover most of the relevant stuff and they do it in a professional way, something that I value even if we are talking about a 300b gank or the destruction of an alliance. Of course NER does a professional job too but INN is generally updated frequently plus they write a variety of interesting articles while nothing is happening.   
---
And yeah, it is interesting to know about these corps but if you look around you'll find other posts where we talk about it. EN24 in that article didn't do anything but be proHorde, something that shouldn't happen since it's a NEWS site. It doesn't even happen in INN. 
---
I don't see whats wrong with it in the context of doing incursions?
---
He's joined a shield logistics fleet/group, if he armour tanked like the Paladin should, he would die on the sites. 
---
😂😂😂
---
when vendettas came out they dropped to 80bil,  cant see them coming up from that point,  they might have held that value due to the trouble getting bpc's 
---
Maybe an input broadcast fleet? Hard to know when they warp out to the pos as soon as you jump into the system
---
WHAT THE EVERLIVING FUCK WERE YOU MUPPETS PLAYING AT. HOW MANY FUCKING REVENANTS DO WE NEED TO FEED TO CVA?
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Sweet mother of God...
---
It's my old ceo. He just uses eve-o preview. Cycles through them all. Hence using mackinaws. He can't keep up if it's hulks or covetors 
---
Some highsec pubbie will haul that to jita for 5M per round trip. 
---
Luring the enemy in a false sense of security. Provi did it again. Well done. Seems to happen annual. 
---
i WILL confirm this.
---
CVA kills  snigwaffe revenant - eve is become an epic place :smile:
---
its almost like brave camping PL supers 
---
it would have lived if it were an armor super
---
HEY! You leave the cat out of this!
---
Karma farming.
---
You people have major problems lol
---
For a renter alliance, you really really care about your killboard. I'm glad you didn't get a chance to convince this guy you're the best thing since sliced bread, I'll take a failfit new player with some balls over a bunch of whiny renters any day.
---
PL will come, they must. 
---
Delve is where line-members have it easiest to make large amounts of isk. 
---
Its the pandafam leaders that use alliance taxes and rental income as their personal titan fund while they send their line-members to do ADM fleets with VNIs and barges. 
---
I told him WTM will accept anything on that list which is true. I recommended he start with a starter ship.
---
I didn't know there was a fucking Paladin on that list lol
---
Well done CVA!
---
Dying. Haha
---
Do the job input materials get stuck in the industry jobs immediately after the shield went down, or is it possible to cancel the jobs and save the stuff before the structure amor is gone? 
---
I know the latter is possible at least for blue print copying jobs.
---
Revenant, topic-starter what is the price?
---
FC whats a fleet warp
---
Pot calling the kettle black.
---
Almost every body dont care about that
---
3% broker fee? It was not supposed to be much much lower? Hope it will be down soon!
---
I am struggling with EIPH now. Even with all skills sett to level five it wants me to buy some items. It's giving me a profit of $60,000Isk/hr making Manticores, which can't be right. I'm also trying to build the components but buy the reaction materials. Is EIPH capable of this? 
---
Vni and Ishtar do the same amount of damage so personally I'd go for the most isk efficient hull, since the vni is cheaper it makes more sense to use that. 
---
Ishtar is a great ship for say lvl4 guristas missions due to the resistance profile.
---
I think it's nice as well, I wished it always showed what I want.
---
I like that there's a Walmart ad on the killfeed page. Fitting for those guys lol. 
---
r u ok op
---
i think it was bound to happen at some point, when you drop them nearly every weekend for few months... :3
---
Some ten years ago, jump into a 0.4, find a wrecked Providence. Cruise over; the wreck is *full* of Mexallon. I was only in something little so I couldn't take much.

For those that don’t understand, I thing he‘s unable to move the D-Scan out of the probing window. Or complaining about not having it in the solar system window... vOv

Someone in waffles just lost a revenant to a bait cyno raven. Things could be worse!
---
Catching mission runners are not that hard.
---
Problem is gallante is in T4 atm and it gives like 500m\~900m isk/hr and even more for input broadcasting chinese LV4 farmers. They just replace their ships even they loss a lot.
---
SUPPERS, NOT EVEN ONCE.
---
Quality reply
---
Yeah it's kinda weird hows rats shoot fighters but not drones. 
---
I don't like carrier ratting personally I think the APM is a little too high. 
---
If fighters where a little less dumb (they should find their own targets) it would be nice, maybe some sort of pre-mission briefing mechanic could be added (cag). 
---
Can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.
---
Downvoted. No Procurer on the killmail
---
&gt; I don't see whats wrong with it in the context of doing incursions?
---
using marauders in incursion fleets is dumb in general
---
any battleship with extender rigs and two deadspace invulns will meet the 100k ehp requirement, but that doesn't mean that spending 1.5b on a paladin that brings nothing to the table that isn't brought by a shield apoc (lmbo) is a good idea
---
and if you're clearly gonna pay2win your ship anyway why not take a minute, ask around, and get one that's actually good (like a nightmare)
---
anyway if you're gonna go all paypal warrior why even bother running incursions in the first place tbh
---
pepega
---
I would like to know more.
---
why they don’t use cloud instead of metal?

An alliance that size should be able to....
---
Some of the waffles guys have  been droping 2 revenants on a regular basis in providence for the last couple of months. 
---
So it's only natural that they get caught at one point. 
---
Was hoping for the pair to drop, however we are not complaining about only catching the one, with the wyvern as a bonus. 
---
One niddhoggur  did manage to mwd  out of the bubbles and warp of.

It's the second Sniggwaffe revenant that dies to provi. 3rd one soon?

Shout out to Marc for using a rev like a baller, not just in an n+1 superfleet
---
Our stock of corp Revenants is still okay tho
---
will this be srp'd ?
---
their capital system under a cyno jammer no less ;)
---
Not mine. One of NC. 's  I think
---
I think each of these tools has an option for you to create a map which only you can see and map away solo. If it's a shared map for a corporation then only you and corp mates can see your location and map. 
---
Will take that rev off your hands. Trade it for my aeon 
---
As if Horde does any thing alone???
---
yes please! 5 is enough

rite

2010 called. It wants his memes back
---
I was a few months into the game, training skills and I went to do some vexor ganking only to find out my cache ran out of hulls. While pondering how to restock vexors I scanned a t1 frig with 30 large skill injectors inside of it and blapped it with a destro. 
---
Marc is a good lad, before he moved it to provi I busted his chops for being risk averse with it, but boi did that change fast. 
---
[lul](https://i.imgur.com/2VgohuM.png)
---
I mean so is tapi and goons?
---
Yikes, that's almost as bad as getting baited in your own staging system and losing a revenant, leviathan, and some other crap
---
Hey dont make them remove our content! Its amazing how many awful fcs you can shove in 2 regions
---
0.3%
---
my thoughts are you need to find the undock button.. no not from stations, the button to undock your dscan. then you can see everything without the solarsystem aswell.... Go join a wormhole corp brah we'll teach you how to use d-scan properly :P
---
To be clear, because you seem an alright dude for helping him out, he was not booted for killboard. We have never once booted someone for killboard. We have tons of people with bad killboards and don't care about that. We care about attitude.
---
He was booted for being openly hostile towards several corp members, and despite the attitude he's displaying here, which we absolutely welcome in BSC, that was not the attitude he held in corp chat.
---
End of story.
---
You finally caught him :D
---
Please give me back the 2 minutes of my life I just wasted following that link. tia
---
Show me on the doll where BSC touched you.
---
Goons. You were supposed to balance the force, not make Serenity.
---
better get some BL FCs man
---
You guys love your war decs lol. Let's fly together in corvettes in Jita and hold space hands
---
seen less shit on toilet paper
---
Which is almost as bad as losing 250\~ dreads in under an hour
---
yawn. too old. but can I have back my minutes having to read your comment?  thanks. 
---
But COULD the site owner see the data and know where someone was? A dozen scanning/relic/data ships come in and out of any j-space systems a day, if some of them are sharing the connections they find publicly, anyone could find a path to any system at will.
---
Although that would be cool, with many people mapping you could probably chart to anywhere in a dozen jumps or less.
---
full FSUs and shield tank to kill a T1 BS. 
---
ah welp i got distracted and missed the point sorry :P
---
just bads all the way down \o/
---
Horde is in the same coalition with NC and PL.Test has its own coalition that even outnumbers PANFAM yet they cant do a single thing without Goons
---
Every waking moment for months, honestly brilliant
---
We all just need to get it together.
---
Third is already dropping, fourth and fifth ones are ready to go SoonTM
---
or stop worrying about what other people think and just enjoy the game.
---
No, the website blows.  you are just being obnoxious.
---
Thats wayyyy to logical, this is eve. Please refrain from use of logic, forward thinking, and preventative measures.
---
It's probably because he doesn't publish his kill feed to Zkill.
---
Lordmopp unironically is the spookiest man in Provi. He's had a dreadbomb up and ready every day for the last 2 months... That's commitment, props to him, it finally paid off!
---
do you even know how reddit works?
---
Thanks for letting me know I will and you can do it on the weekend and I have a meeting at the church for the day. So much for the quick response, I love you so much and have a great day
---
You guys are basically saying: "Hey, I wanna beat you up. But I need my daddy, my uncle, and my brothers to do that. But you can't bring your daddy, because then you'd be a loser."
---
Who are you again? I remember your name, but not who you are.. 
---
a literal nobody
---
False sense of security? 
---
We are under no illusions that Provi can absolutely dumpster us in EUTZ/RUTZ, we get 10-1 outformed... We didn't even bother pinging any faxes/assist.
---
Also, Lordmopp is legit good at/committed to dreadbombing our every move. There's no sense of security here haha
---
Provi is getting better of late. Rather scary actually. 
---
wat
---
Tell Marc I still miss him. Has he told y'all the story of how he wound up getting the boot from here? It's pretty goddamn tragic.
---
I joined after the neocom got changed, and i approve of reinstating the old neocom.
---
MARC, you wank. I'm sorry you got robbed by poors; good to see you're still up and about though.
---
Probably so, but that doesn't stop me knowing your name. Not some ex-wormholer? Hard to keep track :(
---
I've been all over. Lowsec, then wormholes, now nullsec.
---
Why not fly a Nightmare cheaper and much more effective in Shield Incursions.
---
gotta be honest I thought this was a flairbait at first 
---
you know you’ve hit a nerve when the dinos are making replies like this 
---
it’s funny because PanFam is a coalition, legacy is a coalition. And her legacy can never fight without batphoning another coalition. 
---
Weird, huh?
---
The only thing one can flame BL for, is losing a bomber toa bunch of dumb afk multiboxxing miners.
---
I mean, you could just state your in-game name lol
---
For whatever reason, I remember you as either IRS, or using IRS flair. 
---
Or I've lsot the plot which is possible, idk. 
---
I've picked up 1 billion ISK MTUs on a few separate occasions.
---
The pilot who owned them died, their wrecks were looted and I guess they didn't bother going back to get them.
---
2 of them looks like Marauders and one of them was a blingy Vexor.
---
No, never used Shekel Squad flair nor was I ever in Shekel. I've used XIX, Red Alliance, and CODE flair.
---
Off-topic: why are Citadels with no Access Rights visible in the Starmap. Not just like POSes, hidden? 
---
I'm just an Eros Blossom Nid in the wind.

Would you mind repeating that, in English perhaps?

Huh. Losing my mind then, I guess. For some reason I thought you had and was trying to remember who you were. 
---
Rip me I guess. 
---
Blob? What. 
---
Do y’all really think you’re outnumbered by TIKLE? It’s like, at most, 50-60 dudes. 
---
The Broforce. Hasn’t declared war just needs to remind you to watch yourself.
---
tell us again how you are doing lately? :)
---
Don’t need a cYno if you are out of range
---
What's wrong with it? I don't know much, so I'm curious
---
Daddy goons, little brother legacy and our drunk uncle lumio.
---
With level 3 at best and no weapon system skills.
---
Good luck killing anyone with that, doofus.
---
Technically the best person to answer your questions is /u/Zifrian but I can at least begin to ask some questions.
---
First, don't assume T2 ship production is high margin.  Often it's not.
---
Second, if you have T2 component blueprints, make sure IPH knows that.   Check under Edit -&gt; Manage Blueprints.  If you do have them and they aren't researched that alone could account for your low margins.
---
Third, if you click "calculate build/buy" it will assume you're buying things that are cheaper to build than buy and building things otherwise.  The list on the right will be all the things you would need to buy for the production run, not the things you need to make.
---
If all that checks out, it may just be that the market you're in is *bad*.  I just did a quick check and *very* few ships fit my production criteria right now.
---
Make all caps bpo to bpc and drops in DED sites or Level 5 Missions or something.
---
Thank you for the information but I can't seem to find any of those two ingame (tried everything)
---
Goof job Provi! And tip the hat to waffles for actually using it
---
Awesome. Thanks.
---
EVE became risk free kindergarten with partial pay to win model. New player activities consist of bothering GMs with things, which are part of the game since the beginning and shitting up reddit with " \*insert gank corp name\* just blow my shit up plz ban! "
---
Big coalitions are still here doin their ... whatever they are doin. PVP is shit, PVE as well due to bots and mining is OP (in a rorqual that is). 
---
The Serenity shit server merged into Tranquility so we got all them usual features like bots, chinesse ISK farmers and shit like that. Due to this, losses matters little, ships are cheap and you can see armies of titans and supers basically wherever you look. 
---
Faction Warfare is still fucked up.
---
Recently there was war declaration tweak to reflect the needs of the whinny bitches mentioned in the beginning.
---
Lowsec is kill.
---
I miss old EVE, maybe except the learning skills (and even there iam not realy sure). Things - if there was possibility to remove them - i wouldnt miss for sure are injectors, skins, alpha accounts and plex. WTB old trial and subscription based EVE, but thats not possible anymore so ......
---
Yes Grand Ayatollah CCP Falcon (definitely not community rep) pls stop this UI change.
---
okay i respect this
---
o7
---
Ok thanks
---
I'm not exactly sure what there is to "learn" from building anything to be honest, Industry is 10% about number crunching 98% hauling and 1% clicking BPCs and setting a number of runs of items A to Z
---
TAPI IS THE MOST BATTLE HARDENED PVP FORCE IN THE ENTIRE GAME BTW
---
Damn!!! That would have been fun!

Haha yeah when I was on sisi I was looking at it thinking its such a clusterfuck to get to anything.

Insurance should not pay, if there is a killright to the pilot. Only an idea ;)

25 years of training in MS paint has finally paid of eh Edible?

10/10 accurate description of the events (rev pilot)

I hear there's a really stupid guy in SC who derps around caps and supers, you should defo go kill him :P

Looking forward to the SNUFF reddit thread saying that lowsec is dead and it's all CCP's fault next week.

I wonder why Black Rise is dead

Always be careful when you want to join corps and are in hi-sec. If they are a null-sec alliance they are 100% war decced. Go to the nearest null entry to their space before accepting the corp invite. Didn't they mention this during their recruitment process?
---
Sorry you had to learn this lesson the hard way. 
---
The same one's that when transferred to Ghost Legion blocked SNUFF and other alliances based on political ties to The Imperium despite said alliances having never fired a shot at the Keepstar and were part of contracts to defend it in the past?
---
If this is the exact same then that's sad tbh. 
---
I’m afraid there’s no such things as a woman gamer, i am sorry.
---
Dunn, you are back and playing again? Are any of the other CORIM guys playing again as well?
---
Kind of makes me want to come back to the game. Flying with you and Snake was some of the most fun I had in this game, though I don't think Snake is ever coming back.
---
A pretty bad shitpost even.
---
mobile tractor 5
---
I thought there were tons of dinoposts about how TAPI and Goons are completely separate and legacy is a strong independent coalition that don't need no imperium backing despite the goon sigs being far more effective and causing far more disruption to Geminate than they ever were. 
---
Wow this is only 25 years of practice? Imagine what he could do with 100!
---
MSpaint is is the only way to explain something to the average eve player.

Plexes are there as part of an agreed 'controlled warfare' section of the cluster, agreed between the empires and Concord to be for the purposes of system control. Non-participants have no business being there.
---
I'd actually go a step further and just ban non-participants from the plexes. But there's certainly no reason Concord would look unfavourably on FW participants clearing out non-participants from the plexes.
---
Take a look at that Corp killboard, it’s clearly someone’s newbie Corp, and they really need to work on their onboarding comms and training, because their newbros are getting slaughtered. Either way, I’m not sure why anyone would care about a killboard that’s already showing a stellar 48.4% ISK efficiency.

I don’t know anything about Theran Alliance other than that they are frat renters/pets, but if this salty poster here is indicative of how they train their noobs, then Jesus Christ, those newbros are going to win eve in a month or less.
---
Nice vid funny to put firerock launcher lol :)
---
he wouldn't be wrong tho
---
&gt; However, being able to constantly bring back up into a fight with literally no way to stop it is definitely broken.
---
Any non-gated site (e.g. green combat sites, ore/ice sites, anything you combat scanned down except deadspace) is already like that, you have to stop people at the other end. Do you think most of Eve is 'definitely broken'?
---
Being able to slide the gate even if someone outside the plex's class is camping it is good because the whole point of plexes is to allow class-limited engagements.
---
I doubt this is done with Paint. Quality is too high. 
---
Honestly their are many steps a rorqual pilot has to do to be saved properly.  Making sure drones are secure.  Joining correct fleet joining correct coms.  Checking for cyno inhibs.  All while trying to tank as long as possible before blowing the panic.  So if the pilot is not on his or her toes it’s easy to kill/steal drones or the rorqual itself.  Convince me otherwise.
---
When I was relatively new to null, I had a troll blue supercarrier come in and steal one of my faction spawns at the end of an f-hub.  I was in an active ratting VNI.  I looted the wreck as he was gloating about stealing the kill and it contained a High-Grade Slave Omega.  Sold for about a bil.  He mad.
---
One less space poop in the universe.
---
TNT cant even win a sov war in an empty region :)
---
Test has Vily, which is better than anything goons have.
---
Change my mind.
---
Games is too much oriented on farming, the more you farm, the more powerful you/your alliance become. No interesting gameplay and room for anything fun unless you play all day long.
---
Too much minerals can be farmed, they should drastically limit the amount that can be mined. Rorquals would still have the advantage of clearing it fastest.
---
Botting is said to be a problem but the real problem is the game is made like it's intended for bots to farm, not humans to waste their time on those shitful time wasting activities. 
---
They could fix this by making farming more automatic and at most the players would have to defend the farming robots from roaming pirates that can come to loot it (PVP roamers)
---
Muh killboard!!!!
---
Is that a T2 hamster?
---
It s good to see this big toys fighting and not rusted in hangar ;)

Just pixels. Props to Waffles for taking the good fight

Never joined FW myself, but when I fly into a complex then in hopes of getting a fight... I like this idea a lot.
---
hey how much for rev ))
---
it's really good 
---
That’s the thing - I don’t know how minimal this will be. You’re essentially turning off standings in these plexes but nowhere else in the same system - I get the feeling this isn’t going to be something that can be easily coded. 
---
is this the log in initiate hack of 2019?
---
Goons have boat
---
This guy gets it.
---
  EVE is ,blobing,capital blobing,multiboxing,boting,playing something else
---
It was actually the neighbour’s dog, not the cat. We put some peanut butter on the F1 key and the dog licks it. The dog even anchors better than some of the other line members.
---
There is no such thing
---
The jobs get stuck once the armor goes down because that is when low power mode happens. This only gives 1-2 days to cancel the jobs. It looks like they were building fighters in batches of 250, which takes around 2 weeks per job. It also looks like they were building some other things that I haven't figured out.
---

---
Wat
---
killing gankers that are already in the process of tanking isn't tremendously useful 
---
suicide ganking a bump machariel belonging to gankers who are holding a freighter in place with it is a great way to piss nerds off tho
---
Wait... so if someone puts a bounty on someone else for 10,000,000 ... then if you kill that person you only get 1,000,000?
---
For real?

&gt;a mod that is basically half a titan
---
people put those mods on titans fyi
---
there's an abyssal trading website out there I think, and there are channels, but honestly the forums are probably a reasonable place to start
---
if you're rolling your own mods, just make a post in the sell orders section called "u/darkislife1's abyssal emporium" or whatever, keep it updated with what mods you have on hand, and bump it daily. enjoy your sales
---
Find the anom they where in. Sooner or later they will have to return to run it. Drag bubble that one
---
[That was exactly the answer he was looking for](https://i.imgflip.com/2ih485.jpg)
---
Nobody should give you public advice on this because it would just make dumb botters update their scripts. Look at zkill, find bit hunters and talk to them privately. Also bubbling a bot is one thing but you also need a plan to kill it once the alarm rings on the owner’s phone and he comes to the keyboard. If you don’t know how to catch it I sincerely doubt you have the tools to kill it.
---
self respect
---
Do you want other people to play the game with? It sounds like you don't.
---
I think youre too stupid to open mouth or even type. You were not saying that when you were receiving SRP based on my work, or when you received free region and half because of me. When you needed place to rat or build, you were all "Fafer, Fafer" lol, 
---
Wow. If Pathetic Legion, NCDock and Gobbin’s ignorant slaves could fight as hard in-game as they are concern trolling in this thread, they might be able to win a Titan battle. 
---
Now you can buy a good super. Like an aeon 
---
1. Anchor a bubble between the site and the POS a few hundred KM off. 
---
2. Or try to log off a few hundred KM off the POS in a sabre. Log on, bubble up, and hope they land in it.
---
Check if the system is cyno jammed. if it is, covert cynos get will still work. Black Ops BS and covert haulers can bring in more ancorable bubbles to keep it tackled as it burns. Multi scram Arazus will help keep it tackled too.
---
You must be new around here

When I first started playing the game, I found myself for the first time in Gallente low sec, ratting through the belts and got myself a named Expanded Cargo from a Battlecruiser. At the time it was the same as t2 and sold for 30 mill, which for me was mind blowing. 
---
Was early 06 IIRC
---
Tbf other than the bad fit, the revenant doesn't need much in terms of application, but highs and lows are bad on that, yes looking at that crew that setup that shitty fit. I am just not a fan of that fit at all and yes I know who came up with it and all that blah blah blah.
---
Yes, that’s why the current bounty system is worthless and in high tidi fights it causes problems
---
"fair fight" jumping faction supers on a raven... lol.

Is RA doing well?  I read this subreddit maybe twice a week at a glance since I stopped my subs 3 years+ ago and it's just interesting to read all the political moves and such.  
---
I'm still trying to figure out who is who over in that mess over in the east since Tri imploded (using Dotlan) 
---
And watching Darkness rent out all of it's space, until the 'surprise surprise' moment comes when Goons come knocking again and Sort bails on his coalition partners (least that's what his moves are making me think after he had to hand over all those faction citadels without his allies knowledge).  
---
But thanks for answering, always fun to look back into the sandbox every few months and say 'hey, what's going on?'  
---
Can Limited Sleeper Cache's spawn in high sec? Also what area of space do they spawn the most or is it totally ramdom

---
i guess they didn't like my free food :3
---
No to get the 10 m bounty youll have to kill a 100m ship.
---
That's funny coming from someone who needed to batphone the rest of Eve to try kicking us out of our homes and still failed miserably. Have you forgotten how long we kept you logged off during UALX until we got bored? The SPHERE video was cute, but let's be honest, you guys are a husk of the boogeymen you once were.
---
No, what they're saying is that the second largest coalition constantly has to batphone the largest coalition to fight a smaller coalition.
---
You spelt Horde wrong.
---
imagine thinking ccp has the budget to hire student interns 
---
reminder there are about a dozen people left actually working on eve at crowd control production games 
---
&gt;Black Legion  
---
lol
---
Dude, I know, I might be stupid, but not that stupid 
---
Did you have to use black on purple
---
yeah but you did rage out at us for killing that B0PE guys rattlesnake bots when he was in PL (it was free blops frags, when we blopsed drones, because he had his bot on a clean 5 minute timer.)
---
You never talked about your cooking skills, but if they're anything like mine at your age, no wonder!
---
BL freeing those supers when they were thought to be perma trapped in two nights of SpecOps was probably the best fun I had ever in eve. 
---
Thank you Elo!
---
Miners don't go to Valhalla. They go to Veldhalla!
---
I never saw a better AAR before
---
The amount of minerals/ISK in the game increases more in a month than it used to do in a year. CCP doesn’t care. They used to tightly regulate the economy. 
---
We didn't, we jumped in with carrier, 2 hics and supers ready and he instantly ejected the second we started agressing
---
Nice nidhogger skin
---
Shut up
---
This guy has never hunted bots. 
---
It’s pretty easy - find the pos they warp to, find the amok they warp to, figure out their “reset timer” and anchor a bubble in the Anom. 
---
Botters don’t have phone alarms. If you want practice, you can go to Esoteria or Impass and do work on the Gila and VNI bots. Branch is also pretty good. 
---
There's more supers than active players nowadays
---
Thanks, it's the Bitch Out Blossom I think. 
---
Why don't you got to Hedliner and tell him he is bot enabler because he has rentals.
---
As for the shit story, if it was bot go report it.
---
And yea you guys weren't able to follow simple instructions "dont shit where you eat" so you got your bitchslap.
---
Trash like you is always more dangerous to allied income then to enemies.
---
You just fucked up the first step. Stay secret.
---

---
Rule #1 of secret order club, You don't talk about secret order club
---
I mean it's not like it's active or anything. It's just an idea at the moment. I don't think I have very much information on my characters or anything so even if I did do it, no one would know it was me.
---
True lol 
---
You can avoid this by using NPC stations, which can't be shut down or destroyed.
---
Couldn't afford more color, need to save for a super.
---
We're just going to ignore that Goons were on your side and jumped their super fleet down from the north to UALX? That's the biggest super fleet in the game and a 36,000 character coalition you're pretending doesn't exist
---
Invite them to fleet
---
I thought only Brave is allowed to do that.
---
I can't hardly stop laughing. I don't know what I feel worse for, the deer or the servers with the deer. 😂🤣

As always, hit me up for any commissioned work you'd like (yes I take payment in ISK) whether its a cool hull, a dumb photoshop or alliance and corp logo design.

Player retention doesn’t generally happen by people being left alone. Getting people into a corp where they can learn the game is doing wonders for people.
---
Shit post shit corp 
---
Will there be a super secret order club house?
---
Just kidding, reddit is probably the worst place to ask for people on this.
---
Have mineral prices dropped correspondingly?
---
I was just looking for a place to start
---
But the rest of eve dude.
---
It was just 2 tiny entities fighting the rest of eve and they still won!
---
That's what happens when you have hyper-concentrated wealth. I saw a fit avatar for sale in Delve for 60b. At those prices the return for mining is trivial. The market is tapped out. These goons won't go to other alliances in other regions where they can make more money because they don't want the commensurate risk. They'll happily sit and earn pennies in 10b isk ships.

The loot got stripped to fund the hunting of the Rev's twin bother I think. Probably eyes on a Hel next though, hopefully it'll live more than a week. 
---
You have to actually ram them out of their instawarp, that's the only way.  I have caught jackdaws/hecates this way with a jackdaw and a caracal.  I've also lost 2 jackdaws this way.
---
If I buy Omega, train all the skills I needed for the ship, I wanted to fly, and then don't subscribe the next month, will I still be able to fly it?
---
You absolutely could wait to be engaged sure. You just are limited on what you can engage though. For instance if you are in a brawling ship on the button and a kite slicer that’s neutral slides you are dead if you don’t immediately spam lock and scram. 
---
And have you not read any of this thread? Flagging anyone entering a plex as suspect is exactly what is being asked for
---
I are what words good..... Comment 
---
The Gallente hate me, but I have a couple of escalations that end in Gallente systems. Assuming I get through the gates ok, once I'm at the site will they still find me &amp; destroy me?
---
The bot needs to be updated to remember panic.
---
If the ship require you to be in omega to use it then no.
---
How do you get forced out of npc sov?
---
Do you have download everything checked on the launcher. Since I turned that on i still get a black screen but it’s definitely better.
---
So how are nc horde and pl going to outblob tapi and pets and imperium? All those whiners in imperium should look at there own damn blueball and see why we panfam have to group up cause imperium is the cause of the blue donut
---
What you could also do is to start station trading in smaller trading hubs like Dodixie or Amarr where the competition is easier, but there is also less volume exchange compare to Jita.
---
&gt;why won't provi let me fly my expensive space turd without ganging up on me
---
Jackdaws are really hard to kill as you said.
---
But hecate fits blaster and don’t use instawarp mode while shooting, so if you can get super long point ships like garmur and lachesis lots of hecate missioner just fails to change their mode on time or get bumped on rocks/NPCs.
---
T3Cs are easiest, all you must do is warp to mission site with them, they always land on 0m or 10km so always decloaked on gate.
---
Biggest threat is Jamming NPC rats which randomly switches target and missioner’s griffin alt.
---
r/fittings
---
They're just bullies. 
---
Nah they don't hunt you down.
---
Yes, I've seen them all around. Since it's a sleeper thing, there's probably no region preference.
---
I don't think eve has lost that mechanic. I think you, as a capsuleer, have become much wealthier than you were. 
---
You should be relatively fine, just swap to long-range ammo when you go into rooms with the neut towers at range and focus them down first. You might have a minute or two where you are low on cap, but don't panic; everything will even out with the neut towers gone. Once those are down, swap to the ships and take care of them. If you have drones with you, you can drop them and kill any tackle frigs around you while aligning out if you are wanting to take no chances.
---
I flew with TDF for a while. They seemed pretty active.
---
I don't think that changes. 
---
I think it won’t happen in current state.
---
Gallante LP’s price tanking well due to Vexor Navy Issue, So farmers are always happy in T4 gallante.
---
Before Snuff purged Calmil on black rise, Calmils bashed i-hubs and pushed systems......When Galmils stopped to defence their system intentionally.
---
(of course after stocking their juicy lp enough)
---
but there is no real calmil left, so gallante is tanking T4 even there is no one does real gallente FW.
---
I could get behind this if reinforcing it a second time meant the structure didn't go into low power. I like entities fighting over structures, but if you set up bubbles and kill everyone the in rock without a tether, I fear they will not undock
---
BOUT 6 INCHES

being in NC. you no doubt understand the benefit of a seemingly unending amount of batphones?

This is a multi-layered content production. When we are about to lose something important, a bunch of us on break will decide to come back and jump in. Our High Command knows this and these seeming losses are just the setup to some sweet, sweet content.

---
It looks like it could be apart of an eve animated series. Very nice job!
---
no advantage to join horde or NC. either, please all join goons 
---
Yes, the site owner technically gets your info. However the eve developer's agreement specifically bans using or sharing this info for intelligence purposes.
---
For a solo wh hunter/explorer you are fine using the public versions of these services. For a corporate/alliance, maybe look into self-hosting your own Pathfinder instance 
---
Well if I'm wrong and it's not a simple fix, then I agree that there are much bigger problems that I'd rather see addressed first.  
---
just ask them to stop.

Where is the loot from?

As a goon I agree with you

At trying to fit into an armor fleet in order to be primaried first while ignoring their native hull bonuses?
---
Was a poor man too... No Ascendancy Omega :(
---
Can you explain why for the new guys (def not me)
---
God dammit, I'm sitting in fleet in a dread all night and do nothing, then I log off and we kill a rev.
---
i'm not pretending i don't care though.
---
It seems my point flew over your head. Doom was acting tough and said we'd be homeless after he orchestrated a massive blobbong (sic) from every entity in the game besides goons. 
---
If you want to talk about the lack of capability of a "strong independent alliance" - check a mirror.
---
Did goons help us? Absolutely! Would we have needed them if it was just PL coming to invade? Not likely.
---
So why was PL decced too? Clubbing dino brains in low/null was fun enough.

are you salty that they got better friends now?

Am I the only one that still calls them the CFC?
---
All i know is. If a rev is on grid. And a niddy leaves it behind. You should be kicking that nid pilot.
---
Not if the skills you're training are omega-only. For example, alphas can't train Heavy Assault Cruiser. So if you subscribe for a month and train HACs, then drop the subscription, you effectively won't have the skill trained anymore, and so you can no longer fly a Muninn.

let em put fuel in the structure during the anchor period,  and then as long as fuel is in structure(can be refueled any time) its online
---
but if its low power and reinforced, then fueled. its still low power until it repairs.  if it repairs then if theres fuel it goes online.
---
good?

Thats very reasonable. I have always felt they should require fuel blocks to even start.

If your corp is only you and your alt, then I wouldn't put one up at all. I'd go join an existing corp with existing assets.

So you built them in an Azbel with Test tags on it and make it a target? That's some shit planning
---
Sooka bliat’
---
idk current evidence seems to suggest otherwise.
---
Yikes. Thanks for the info.
---
sad but true
---
What's worying me most is that I'm not even cap stable in a normal environment. According to the ship simulation, I have about 3 minutes before I run out depending on the ammo I'm using. Admittedly, in most missions I can toggle my repair on/off instead of having to keep it on constantly, so cap has never really been a problem in practice. However, using Radio M's, I only get 162dps (drones not included), which might be insufficient to whittle down the neut towers in time.
---
"if 3/4 of the game teams up together we'll win a fight"

Lol.

I like this guy. Brings a energy I haven't seen in a long time. Keeps Corp chat fun.

If your adjusted Gallente standings are terrible (-5.0 or lower) then faction navy NPCs will shoot at you anywhere in Gallente space and make mission running a pain. https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/NPC_standings#Faction_standings  
---
Training Diplomacy will raise this.
---
Because if you feel the need to bring up what specific games you play and explaining that to a girl you just met they likely figure there isn’t much else interesting going on. 
---
Most women aren’t repulsed by video games or EVE itself but if you make that one of things you decide to lead into a potential relationship with there are red flags there everywhere.

dont jinx it
---
1920 x 1080 pieces like this generally take 4-6 hours. If a piece gets more complex , like some of my commissions, it can take 15-20 hours depending on the level of intricacy. I had a pin up nyx last week that was about 20 hrs but you're talking about multiple textural overlays, custom skin, hand painting and beauty retouching a pin up model and so on. 
---
Yea for sure, ill throw together a contract for my revelation, for your aeon.
---
I must confess..
---
It's very nice.
---

Olds are very patient, they have been camping pb for forever, also; they killed my first billion which i spent on importing shit in my DST. Good times!

I admit last I played was several years ago but Dixie seemed to be drying up.

I like to set up an IFTTT custom macro that sends a message to my Alexa telling it to say "Hostile spotted, GET SAFE". I'll upload the code to stackexchange later today.

Deal. However, my aeon is in the 9UY KS so....
---
Ownership is all that matters. Provi member, btw.
---
As I said, this is for **future** purposes. Putting it up for myself, right now, isn't very sensible.
---
I'm not Meizu Kho.
---
Uh huh 
---
Astra
---
&gt; You really think you'd be having more fun 10 years ago having to rat for an hour to fit a t1 frigate to PvP with than you do today ratting for an hour to fit a faction cruiser?
---
On the other hand, with ship value inflation there is no actual replacements on higher end of that spectrum. Sure, we've got faction titans, but due to lack of any actual use advantages those are almost never put in any real danger - even if they move around, they go with full supercap fleets or jump Keepstar to Keepstar. Several years ago getting to titan for average quite decent player was about 1000 man-hours of grind or finding good way to circumvent that (that's equal to over 6 months of full time job), so getting or killing one was feasable feat. Now... well, now your average 10-alt Rorqual mining op can make that in 50-80 hours.
---
So while on lower end of value spectrum your argument makes solid sense, there is currently no good comparision now to how valuable and effective 5 years ago was hunting down moving titan or managing to pin down and obliterate full faction battleship/T3C fleet.
---
Hahahahaha fool!
---
Uh this is so sweet! Do you have footage of the ferox bombing as well?

Anyways I'm glad to see another full-length dread video from you! Always make time to watch them :)

---
sorry its only unfair and broken when the OTHER SIDE has overwhelming batphones and supercaps.
---
oh shit my bad i'm new
---
Thanks Tom
---
For starters you shouldn't use near2
---
My view on it is, Astra has insanely better defences, and as your corp grows, pve or industry  folk no matter, you will become a bigger target. 
---
So I would fit out a nice Astra, and talk to your corp about getting a mandatory defence doctrine. It’s more than fair enough to ask that of your members, or they’re not worth having.  
---
Even if they have little interest, someone is gonna shoot your sandcastle. Also it might get your crew interested in pvp, and some great experience. If you don’t think you can handle the defence as a corp, call in some support. At the end of the day, if you lose your Astra fighting as a corp, giving it all you have, you’re guys should be hyped for the next opportunity. 
---
I completely agree with your reasons for getting a raituru as well, and it does make sense for your Indy / pve guys, so use the rait for those purposes and your Astra for when you inevitably get wardec’d. Have your defence doctrine in the Astra I would reckon, and maybe some stealth bombers in the rait. A backup doctrine in the rait would be very beneficial as well. 
---
Logistics is easy with a DST, blockade runner or using Red Frog and other hauling services. 
---
I understand it’s a lot of money we’re talking, so how about I gift you an Astra and some fits? If you’re not ready for the plunge yet, just let me know. In game char ‘bill deburg’ (damn Reddit). 
---
Hope it goes well for you bud and I’d be happy to talk over tactics  etc if you wish. 
---
Edit: would you consider moving your Corp to a WH? ) a nice wee c1 or c3 nobody wants, you can do industry, mining, group combat sites, PI, and even go out looking for trouble in some frig fleets etc. 
---
open volume mixer, mute whatever it is you're getting pings from.
---
job done.
---
wh space
---
Why use it then
---
I'll mail you, in-game, and we'll continue this conversation. Sound good?
---
Don't be bad
---
I'll mail you, in-game, and we'll continue this conversation. Sound good
---
ITS OVER 9000
---
These are awesome. Machariel anyone? ;)
---
How do you still not get the Nidhoggur though ;//
---
Awesome bud, I might not be online for the next couple days (work), but maybe tomorrow eve. 
---
Thanks for sharing. I enjoyed the music, especially the Linkin Park remix
---
The shortest answer: neither
---
CVA here, give us more :)
---
I was trying to clarify the fix that folks were suggesting - just the neutrals getting a suspect flag or everybody getting a suspect flag makes a difference. 
---
Define mattering. 
---
As in we didn't kill your excavs? 
---
If you don't have any - cool story. Mining drone deaths don't matter to a person who doesn't use them. More at 11. 
---
If you do - congrats for not being a brainlet. 
---
If we did kill your excavs? Link your lossmail &amp; thanks for the salt. 
---
It doesn't matter because we didn't stop mining in Delve completely and bring about the collapse of the Goonian empire? Wasn't our goal.
---
So, define us having fun blowing up expensive drones *mattering* for me if you could.
---
Oi
---
Noice!
---
Would be even better if my boi can transform
---
Warping around 7RM (then horde staging) looking for invaders to pew pew, dread guristas BS in belt, pew pew occurs, high grade crystal omega drops... heavy breathing...
---
Because they want it to perform well and not cost an arm and leg. "The Cloud" is garbage for workloads that are single-thread heavy, don't scale up and down dynamically, want to have predictable (and low) latencies, and run 24/7. CCP's game server workload is the absolute worst case for AWS.
---
the first dread I bought I tossed a fleet support HAW fit onto, and ended up accidentally fighting 20 scourge machariels
---
didn't kill anything but was doing ok until I ran out of cap, then I died.
---
Ooh also a great hull, and thank you!
---
When Panfam batphoned Frat, Trumpy, Skillu and whoever else was there is was fine.
---
When Test batphones rest of Legacy and Goons it's dirty, unhonorabru blobbing.
---
Stop crying.
---
He was in the corp for a day dude.
---
something something super secret spy stuff
---
Alrighty. Let's lengthen that with some reasoning. I'm here to learn and understand these sort of things.
---
Yep ik ty! I already have some posts up in the forums but no one seems to be interested in the 60bil mods lol
---
yearly tradition
---
That's literally the opposite of what happened.
---
Goons and Legacy had just a NIP until Panfam, Frat, Trumpy and Skillu decided to start World War Ree.
---
hmmm
---
I don't know why I find this shit so funny but it makes me laugh a lot.
---
a yearly tradition, so we'll have to wait a little bit.
---
Doesn’t really matter either way if a militia member is suspect in a plex. Your already consenting to pvp against all of the enemy militia and any neutral who is sliding into a plex is already mind set they are going to attack whoever is in there so makes no difference. 
---
Thats highly dependant on what you are flying and the alliance you are in.  VNI is often dead before help could arrive, a tanked super with cyno in delve will in most cases live long enough for help to arrive.             
---
              
---
If you want to avoid near2 then i suggest running combat sigs, hm loki was best last i did it, ticks are lower but loot leaves you in the 100m/hr range. No-one can warp to you without probes  so you only have to dscan when neuts are in system. Most gangs didn’t have probes or didn’t bother when i ran them. 
---
Most high sec free ports charge a pittance for services. NPC stations usually charge what? 2%? It's far less then what you'd spend on just fuel alone. If you want a structure just to have one, then it really doesn't matter which one you pick now does it?
---
Get to know your neighbors first, don't piss people off, remember that a fleet of a handful of people can kill both structures easily.
---
Shocking that TAPI is getting battered even on reddit. Morale must be shockingly low. 
---
Speaking of cant winning a war, who's couch is co2 on right now.
---
Eh, to an extent, I suppose it really doesn't matter. I'm just trying be as objective about it as I can and take into consideration the needs of potential Corp members. Gotta be a good Tyrannical Ruler and all that.
---
Indeed. Best start behaving myself or saving for a Fortizar. XD
---
I'm using 2 vnis to be specific and I'm in test for the moment I might join goons though since I've heard delve is pretty safe
---
They on there own stil have way more guys than we do
---
Production raitaru in hisec is a waste as your rigs won't work nearly as good as in nullsec or whs.
---
Put down an astra if you want it to be able to defend itself against a super small group.
---
Put down an unfit raitaru with just a clone bay if you want a home for your corp and then replace it when it dies.
---
Because you've said there is no specific use you wanted from those structures, and unfortunately, both Astrahus and Raitaru are very specialized.
---
From your description of yourself and your corp, I boldly presume you won't have the necessary patience to maintain your structures regularly.
---
Yeah, both Astrahus and Raitaru are pretty cheap and won't be a big deal just abandon them, but still, just my suggestion
---
Lol. Hard to tell if this is a troll to make people crazy about NEAR2/AFK VNIs or a person really wanting to configure it for min effort.  
---
Either way, I hope everyone gets what they want. :-)
---
I've gotten 4 true sansha spawns belt mining in .5 this month, one dropped an EANM.
---
Lasker I have always enjoyed watching your solo dread fights.  I happened to had been asleep when that fight in Tama happened due to time zone differences and missed out. 
---
/cheers
---
I just found the stiletto killmarks.
---
That's the result of the "elite alliance" mindset that was cultivated by Panfam for years.
---
They have more players, you have more "elite" players.
---
But you’re also slowing down their agility and warp time.
---
RuneScape
---
yeah as a test member we get help from goons way more often than our own coalition helps us (not that I'm complaining I just don't know why)
---
That would've been sick! Great idea my dude 
---
Nice to see this die after it blobbed our 10man crapacal fleet. Had a nice fight going on then boom. Blobbbbb
---
Unless you are manufacturing hundreds of billions of isk worth of stuff, then you'll either just want to use an NPC station or just build in Jita because the 2% or so that you save won't be very relevant. If you are, then you'll want to be in null sec in an Azbel or a bunch of Raitaurs with T2 rigs. You'll probably spend north of 50B fitting everything, but at that point, you'll have enough isk that it's not an issue.
---
Unironically the doodling accurately captured many core characteristics of presented shipmodels
---
you can read reddit, but not intel?
---
sad.
---
The only reason I stopped trolling you while in PL was because penifSMASH told me to stop. Your corp was trash, as evidenced by people like Rocket X/Rekking Crew being threatened with a purge at the time if they didn't go on bope fleets (All of which were join or be purged, regard Lee Chanka). Not to mention the countless feeds/stupid losses/idiotic fleets coming out of Bope. I never used BOT space to rat or build, and any pveing I did was typically exploration in hostile space (Typically Amamake region) so I could at least have the chance to find content. 
---
People like you are the reason pvp alliances die out, because all you ever did was enable trash players, spies, botters and rmters to seem like they have legitimate value. You did not, your corp did not, still does not and I will enjoy farming you if we cross paths, now that I no longer have to pretend to give a fuck about trash like you. Enjoy ruining whatever trash-ass alliance you're currently in and your dank income streams. 
---
Jan 18 then Jan 27, must have been a week ban or a good ruse. I could use a vacation come to think of it
---
Don't affiliate yourself with "Vader" yet, my young Anakin
---
just turn it off, no more pings
---
Was input broadcasting a permanent ban? I think it was a 1 week ban for 1st offense right?
---
Are you the rorqual that got jammed? Or are you the other dude with three rorquals that got nuked on a ping?
---
My afk ratting Curse had 6m ticks, if that helps.

Time to settle in

I hear Astero and Recon cruiser are a good combo for catching mission runners on mission gate.
---
I think so, yes.
---
Elite players dont matter if its 5 vs 1
---
Good job exterminating the swarm of crawling metal beetles.
---
What is this? A jpeg for ants? 
---
here. we. go.
---
Great advice.  
---
The just remember to bookmark everything (did you bookmark that exit), bring an extra set of probes,  and make a good safe and remember there is always a cloaked T3c someplace. :-)
---
south east rarely gets pinged, usually i'm interrupted less than once every 2 hours, and it's usally just a flyby
---
Rorqs def need nerfing. They are too strong for the true PvPers to fight.
---
Only 55 have been killed in the past 6 days.
---
Oh nice try sir! 
---
Guys, I'm not sure what happened but when I was in fleet somehow I was warped to the target without me doing anything! He must have broadcasted to my PC as well! I AM SHOCKED!
---
Obvious troll is obvious
---
Nicely done. 
---
I need more of this ship art. can you please draw more?
---
Yes, but you've got to say the secret word.
---
:D
---
I'll keep you in mind when something big happens again. 
---
Thanks.
---
For sure, ever loss has some good lessons in it (and probably some of the wins too, although they are harder to find). Hope you enjoy.
---
Glad you liked it, thanks for taking the time to comment.
---
My first ever HAW Dread fight was me in a Rev against 12 frigates...
---
Just a reminder that every time someone posts on reddit they have had the though process that what they are submitting is a good post.
---
Raitaru, but I'd wait with putting it up imo. Let it be a corp event with the guys you recruit. :)
---
Thanks man, appreciate it. Sorry you missed the Tama fight :)
---
Who cares about the cheater who got a temp ban
---
OOF
---
Living up to their tried and true nickname of tr0pa de shit.
---
So when am I getting my 130bil back?
---
this, but unironically
---
Thanks for actually answering and not being retarded like the other commenters
---
Only 55 of thousands active in the game, the number of rorqs dying probably needs to be triple that for minerals and ships to actually be worth something again. 
---
Well done Edible.
---
TIL one week is 9 days
---
I'm curious about the dual injectors on the Phoenix, and the necessity of an ACR to fit them; do you find that the sheer volley of the Phoenix is enough to generally overcome the (relative) lack of application from forgoing the second Rigor Catalyst and the option of a missile computer?
---
For the Moros, did you find that the higher base tracking of the blasters- and the ability to include a TC- meant that you could use the rig slots for tank? Also, considering the Moros is bonused for rep cycle time, why not go triple nanopumps for better cap efficiency?
---
I think you're imagination is off.  And says something very strange about you.... 
---
Lol I was not banned fucking retards. Its unreal the shit you swing here. 
---
Most of GalMil cashed out and left low sec for null/wormholes/wherever.
---
This looks awesome. Do you have more designs? I'd love to see the pixel version of all the ships. 
---
something something never trust reddit :/ 
---
on a side note... fuck input broadcasting and anyone who uses it :P sorry not sorry Marshy
---
They were never banned you fucking retard
---
This is the second ship I've done. Did the Astero a few days ago. It's in my post history :)
---
Delve is only safe-ish for well tanked capitals, Theta squad ain't going to bother helping you in a VNI, you couldn't survive long enough. Esoteria seems to have less ships lost than Delve does. Esoteria doesn't even usually make the top 10 most violent regions on dotlan where Delve is usually 3 or 4.
---
Oh and Delve isn't safer because no one roams there, it's because they have a massive cap umbrella. You will get pinged all the time in Delve, there's always people roaming through.
---
TIL if you aren't banned you have to log in every day
---
lol what a retard outburst.
---
ofc penif told you to stfu because thats ceo job to tell retards to stfu. 
---
Regarding Rekking Crew, both me and Rocket knew we are not cultural match, but they had problem getting into PL into desired corporartion. Since I knew him, and also because it would be disaster if tehy went to BL at that time. I took them in to merge, Rocket soloed a titan and suddenly he wasnt a dark horse but hero. Snigg took them in, as anticipated, and Rocket went to create the Rekking crew, and was fantastic addition to keep dropers in PL alive after Mr Blue left. I consider this great success and great play.
---
My corp, with help from few others, lead by Lee, the best sniper fc ever, that could shut down system with 15 people, took a region with max 40 man tornado fleets from ra, defended by PL contract. When we came in PL, we were long time in upper quarter of kb, and if you were to divide kills with active members, a lot of time first which is quite a feat. Nothing lasts forever, but achievements stays and does matter. You can have opinion when you achieve something. Copycating ISRAD great posting talents and their patterns speaks good for them, because you learned something from them like a parrot does, but you are pale. And you did take isk for SRP.
---
So I recently got into a Blops ,  and have been trying to drop in certain areas. But for some reason on Dotlan , I can never have my jump range map show npc kills. First i enter my jump range ,  then make it show on the map of a specific region. But the filter is stuck at sovereignity and will never switch onto NPC kill ? Help . 
---
grand slam right there
---
disgusting
---
I know what you mean re:  "blasphemy". I put a lot of time/effort/thought into all  my characters names,  and the corp is named after them.  Thats been my main project in EVE since I started in 2014.
---
    
---
It might be easier to go join another corp - but I won't abandon "my baby" :-)
---
Nice double post you fucking retard
---
I know someone who got banned when they weren't and it was a month. Alt tab too fast and you get banned. Even submitted a video and ccp doesn't care. If enough people complain, you can catch a ban.
---
get rekt horde
---
I think some dudes decided to shoot some other dudes
---
posting is free, but maybe it shouldn't be
---
MATAR VICTOR! 
---
so he was never banned for BLATANT Imput broadcasting and numerus reports? man CCP is doing a great job, i guess when you have 75 paid characters you are allowed to do whatever the fuck you want 
---
/u/finnthedogg is obviously input broadcasting &gt;:(
---
My brain was tickled by the quality of this post.
---
I guess you could create some alpha clones if you really really wanted to, but that is a PITA to manage, since you can have no more than 1 alpha logged in at the same time.
---
Theres some issue on the reddit mobile app right now that gives you an error when posting a comment, but it actually goes thru.
---
That's exactly the sort of thing that someone who was banned would say.
---
This just got interesting.
---
I beleive this is the guy from rekking crew that posts vids on YT of him volleying ratting carriers and the such from a pos in derelik, jumping into catch/provi no?
---
&gt;"Guys, I want to start a secret society"
---

---
minor infraction warranting a warning at absolute most
---
not just on mobile, Reddit servers are a bit fucky rn 
---
Buffer Gila? 
---
Imput coradcasting isn't input broadcasting and the more you report it doesn't get more true.
---
How much LP is required to hit T2?
---
Makes sense
---
Well you see what *actually* happened is he tabbed through all 75 clients really fast and ~~lit a cyno~~ hit ctrl + v and then enter on all of them. Pretty simple stuff really. Are you sure YOU'RE not a bot??
---
The narwhal bacons at midnight?
---
Was testing tank on a super, it bounced off of it on and onto his titan which had been bumped off tether.
---
have you not seen the post of him posting the exact same text w/ the  exact same typo on all his toons across like 4 differend chats at the exact same time? 
---
Why can't we all just rorqual mine in peace
---
Someone shot someone and that someone shot someone who shot someone and did the shoot on someone.

welcome to eve players
---
Are you just acting dumb or are you legitimately this dumb.
---
Let me ask you a question. Have you ever been in the driver seat of a Subaru?
---
Temp ban
---
Great work!
---
Which part do you think is particularly pro-Horde? It certainly wasn't my intention; I wanted to look at the trade-offs between 'single' corp structure like Horde used to have vs 'multi' corp structure that they're building now. I have written opinion pieces *and* news pieces, and whilst I don't intend the former to be neutral, the news pieces should be.
---
To say that INN isn't biased is... a bit of a stretch. I love reading INN, there are some great writers on INN, but even Mittani has made clear that the point of INN is to put forward the Imperium's side of the story.
---
Either way, I'd like to hear any constructive criticism and I'm sure the rest of the team at EN24 would as well
---
Farming rigs?  
---
This article was written 3 hours after Relentless Destruction joined Horde. The move towards a multi-corp alliance started with the CO2 corps sure, but wasn't something we'd really written about other than "oh, this happened".
---
So you're saying we can go back to reporting to prolong your vacation, eh?
---
Do you really not understand jokes, or are you normally this thick skinned?
---
I meant anything you do mattering. 
---
Go for it. If external harassment is your thing :) CCP police this shit not you..
---
Its like you never experienced the old school DD's that did this to an entire system, be happy its been nerfed down to what it is now.
---
probably just a fun roam that got intercepted, not al fights are reddit worthy
---
First of all, the disrespect of putting corvettes on kill mails is absolutely fantastic. I always try.
---
So fast... post was made before a big part of the killmails finished loading :D
---
TFW you take a nap instead of going on a stratop and don't get bosoned.

A lot of rorq pilots I have talked to look at that mod as a save my rorq button and completely forget it can cover any exhumer in range until after they are dead.
---
Im pretty sure it was the grid not the system 
---
Maybe just maybe a 1k alliance shouldn't have total super cap dominance in a 36k coalitions (42k when you include the drf and renters) space?
---
Never banned eat shit lul
---
If it's the first time he's banned for this he won't be permabanned. Falcon also told butthurt people to report him properly instead of crying on Reddit.
---
No if anything in that situation it would make sense to call him thin skinned not thick?
---
Not involved btw ignore me 
---
Yeah and that caused him to get an advantage how?
---
Very cool
---
never warp 1000 people on one spot infront of a bus

'member when people complained that Titans could use single target DD's on subcaps, I 'member
---
There's just no counterplay.
---
Please spend your time more on what you think CCP should do according to your interpretation of their EULA and make yourself look more like a moron.
---
If your reports got him banned.. you see him away another week?
---
If your the idiot you are.. you will see him for a much longer time in delve.
---
Ahh yes thank you
---
His narrative is that he wasn't banned, he just randomly decided to take an exactly 7 day long vacation right in the middle of his deployment to delve to try and disrupt the money making. Which was conveniently scheduled for just a few days after being reported for blatantly broadcasting chat across his characters in local....
---
IMO best looking ship in the game, good work!
---
Yeeeaaah.... That was very well played ;)
---
GF, we'll get you next time.

Mar5hy's official statement on the matter:
---
&gt;This has been hanging over my head since Thursday when I stumbled away from my PC with a vague sense that I had done something horrible. I didn't know the extent of how much of a shitheel I had been until today, when images of my mistake went up. As many of you now know, I accidentally left ISBoxer running after logging in while typing a single line of chat - except that I was so smashed that I didn't recall exactly what I said (as anyone who was there can tell you). When I came to the forums the other day and saw threads complaining about my behavior - not remembering what I'd said - I assumed that I was enduring the usual anti-Mar5hy trolls, and posted something like "deal with it\~" in my usual "Don Crew" way.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Then I landed, and saw the article listing my actual quote.   
---
&gt;Christ.   
---
&gt;I feel absolutely ashamed of my behavior in that chat channel. It's one thing to play a villain in an online roleplaying game - when I post on these forums or on twitter, I usually do so as 'Mar5hy', and do my level best to convince everyone that I'm an unrepentant space villain, as that kind of facade provides an in-game advantage to me and my crew. But I am not that character in real life, as anyone who has met me can attest. I went way, way, /way/ past the line on Thursday night by accidentally input broadcasting in a chat channel. I, as a person, am not the entity that I play in EVE; I am not actually a sociopath or a sadist, and I certainly don't want people to have to read the same line of chat over and over in an internet spaceship game, no matter what I may say or do within the game itself. CCP may say 'EVE is Real', but EVE is not real - and the line between the game and reality should not be overstepped.   
---
&gt;I'm relieved to discover that the chat recipients are doing fine and chatting away, despite being blown up by my crew in-game. They deserve, and they have, my heartfelt apologies - here in public as well as a private apology. There's no excuse for what I did - while some might try to use my inebriation as a mitigating factor, I put myself in that compromised mental state, and the guilt of that is entirely mine.  
---
&gt;If I could go back in time and not have accidentally left ISBoxer on after logging in, I would do so. While the Eve Online character "Mar5hy" would never apologize for any sort of villany in game, I myself, as \*\*REDACTEDNAME\*\*, feel utterly ashamed and sickened by my behavior. 
---
I think in the circumstances we should all immediately forgive him and forget this entire affair even happened.
---
First infraction, no proof he used it to gain an advantage - deserving of a permaban?
---
Don't be mean, this isn't Visual Aids.
---
But I knew he was going on vacation a week before broadcastgate. :bigthink:
---
is it really that hard to doge a boson?
---
he came so hard it hit his face and the jizz is dripping down his chin
---
Oh cool, can I run that in a server VM localy for myself, or on a shared host if I want to set it up for my corp?
---
Why? If they’re better players than you i think its fair. Its not about the size of the stick, its how you use it.
---
nah, we're all actually TNT pets
---
Bosons are hot this week
---
its simply proof that hes using imput broadcasting, only because he was caught by sending text across 75 characters does not make it "bad" evidence, he has it set up, and hes running it 
---
This is indeed an idea that I've had mulling around in my head
---

Good points. Much obliged for cutting straight through the shit.

back in like 2011 when pulse abaddons were hot it was my first time sitting in a loki. thinking im indestructible in the fleet since logi got me prelocked... we drop titans and friendly titan DDs me :(
---
I'm commenting on legacy's competence, not on skill urselfs number.
---
Km for ants that's for sure 
---
A well placed boson is unavoidable, generally playing on knowing where a fleet is going to land or show up, such as a gate.
---
Cyno dd’s
---
I wasnt there is this the fault of a boson or lazy fcing?
---
195 vs. 460.   How else does one win that?   
---
That would imply you killed him, which would imply you guys can pvp. Losing 88% of your vessels, thats not just bad skills, you must be cursed. 
---
[s] Yep, we got boson'd once.  They have supercap dominance.  Packing our shit to move to lowsec. [/s]
---
ccp doesn't do 7 day temp bans
---
NC and PL dropped their (old) mass rental empires and the CFC consolidated more tightly in the north explicitly as a response to Phoebe+Fozzie.
---
We had control over the field before the boson happened
---
"we used to eat shit so be happy you're drinking piss"
---
It's hard when the whole fleet just burns to the gate. 
---
Matter of time till mister input addict does a fuck up again... 
---
So are you saying its legacy’s fault for allowing skill urself to have dominance? Not a game mechanic issue?
---
Because if thats the case I agree and just misunderstood you.
---
He was on vacation, reddit "assumed" it was a ban, and you know what they say, assumption is the mother of all fuckups :P
---
This was just perfect, on the spot execution by the biggest galaxy brains in this game. No reason to whine really.
---
That's a strange problem, it works fine for me. Could you describe exactly what you do to get the range map? (exactly which buttons you press and in which order) You don't need to show what system you're staging from obviously. Also have you tried it in a different browser?
---
If all else fails, try appending "#npc" to the end of your URL when you're looking at the region with various systems outlined, such as in [this example](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/map/Deklein/K5F-Z2,0P-F3K,FMB-JP,XCF-8N,AD-CBT,TXME-A,CU9-T0,YA0-XJ,2-KF56,94-H3F,4U90-Z,QPO-WI,FO8M-2,T-945F,2R-CRW,CCP-US,VFK-IV,R8S-1K,2O9G-D,I30-3A,NC-N3F,S-DN5M,II-5O9,JU-OWQ,C7Y-7Z,N-TFXK,3OAT-Q,MXX5-9,X-Z4DA#npc).
---
well yes, but if you get dragged/bosoned on a gate you fucked up in the first place.
---
but this wasnt them getting bosoned on a gate right?
---
looking at zkill this was ''midfight''?
---
so i assume, cyno went up next to fleet, bus jumps in and bosons? if yes, is it really that hard to dodge?
---
serious question btw...
---
You mean like using pings? Or weeding out spies? Or not being predictable? 
---
*grid
---
lol always the blues you have to watch out for
---
that was very short lived, and still only did it to a grid
---
Who would win without losing a single mainline ship, 200 virgins or 480 newbeans? 
---
The Boson is a distracting anecdote of how big this dunk was.
---
sigh
---
Yup that is what I'm saying. Legacy getting outplayed with no reasonable excuse is the issue here, not bosons.
---
Incursions are all about max-DPS high-resist low-buffer logi-tank. Should definitely have had a travel fit on though. Remember this submission next time somebody claims EVE is P2W.
---
yeah I didn't mean to take that fight, it just sort of happened when I warped to gate instead of station
---
Even Chtibba must be proud of the amount of mining these guys did
---
Becouse it collects data
---
it was on a gate
---
Wouldn't you want to have rage torps for battleships?
---
Which isn't illegal. 
---
Marshy bypasses CCP admin controls to kill Rorqs. Be very afraid.
---
that only works for so long and ties up your character unless you have a dedicated cloaky  camper alt.
---
Not banned lul. 
---
They got bosoned when they warped to a gate trying to extract. The fight was over beforehand.
---
God damn, you're a worst poster than stainguy.
---
Your retarded interpretation of "no blues" is the reason you're a pussy. Blues is allies. Everywhere in eve. Blues are people not in your Corp or alliance that your leadership has decided it wants to suck the dicks of. Wormholers don't do that. Except the babies who can't manage on their own. You are extremely easily identified as a spod brain, you wouldn't make it into any decent wormhole Corp if you tried, so threaten away dipshit.

Also LOL bragging about playing a casual as fuck mmo as a defense for not understanding basic shit ahaha. I bet you're in LBFB

Please Biomass yourself in game. Kthx

Should I park it, keep it safe or keep it going? Will be sad when in dies though such good memories! =)

For saying that if a 1k alliance feels safe dick swinging supers in a 42k coalitions space maybe there are bigger problems that boson balance at play?

There's zero chance that an alliance in a coalition like that declares war on a member of another coalition without it being discussed among coalition leadership first.

"Less than one second ago"? You were fast on the old print screen key there.
---
Get caught before they can decycle command bursts? Wetu gets reinforced while waiting for the burst to decycle. 
---
Legacy had lost the fight and the objective and were retreating back home. Bubble was up on a gate they were planning to take and they warped straight onto zkillboard instead.
---
You're really selling that wormholer life man. Be more toxic i'm sure you can get modded even here.
---
I am new to eve, and a relatively casual player of it. I do not have a firm grasp on everything in it yet. I don't see anything wrong with that, or with trying to become more familiar with it.
---
But by all means keep thumping your chest i'm sure its very impressive.
---
♫Straight through the heart♫
---
Great questions, more testing required. The cap throughput of the 2x cap boosters feels amazing, and is great at say dealing with neut pressure. On the other hand, having insane application is also awfully valuable. 
---
I don't have a clear favorite Phoenix fit. 
---
For the Moros, the fit you see in that lossmail is not a fit I am wild about. While it has great tracking, I think it gives up too much else to get it. I am now experimenting with tankier Moros fits that have worse tracking, but better staying power.
---
Great question, I don't know, would have to take a look.
---
Mate if you drive cars through their narrative they will stop feeding you.
---
Neither are worth it for fuel prices if you're solo, even small numbers. You need very regular, consistent use, going by experience solo running an athanor, (tldr; not cost effective to have my own refinery without more people). Basically, how good are you at recruiting and recruiting the right people! 
---
I don't store valuables in my space castles, not when there are stations around. An astra might be fun if you want a fight though. 
---
What about an athanor, at least it can make money as well as burn it? 
---
Thanks, So it was a mistake in FCing! Hopefully lesson learned, shit happens

input broadcasting is allowed, if CCP didn't ban him its because they didn't find him using it to anything not legal
---
To be more precise, INIT. had Augorors formed in a circle around the Keepstar and chained together, then lit cynos. After the ceremony, they self-destructed and warped off together.
---
Aw hell yeah. My favorite ship to fly! I love it!
---
Yeah I got a few snaps of that two but either way damn Impressive
---
I mean, sure, I'm open to anything. I guess an Athanor just seems a waste if it's not on a moon. Then again, a Raitaru can seem like a waste if it's not manufacturing, and an Astrahus can if it's not fighting. It's really 6 one, half dozen the other.

the issue comes if (and I don't know what happened here) the boson kills you in warp to a gate with no bubble, there really isn't much you can do about that

Indeed.  TTT wasn't the initial objective.  But once it became the objective TEST had no choice to show up.  They showed up in large number but couldn't push us off.  
---
I'm all for some good nature chest thumping, but to claim PH was losing during any point in that fight is nothing short of ridiculous.  It was a good fight.  TEST fought well and nothing can be taken away from them for what they did.  But lets drop the nonsensical propaganda.

Lol! Pays to be extremely risk adverse. 
---
except from when snuff is around you'll be under strict orders not to undock unless it's autz and have errestrian to protect you!
---
Pick a goal. Form a small group of friends together to meet that goal. Once you have a few people established (I would say at least 6 in the same TZ/play hours) then consider dumping down an astra in your own little home space. Don't plonk it down willy nilly when you're not sure it'll all work or if it'll just get literally blown up. 
---
This is especially true since alot of highsec based corps get activity levels destroyed early on by being wardecced. Combine that with a lack of timezone expansion (try being the only AUTZ player in a USTZ corp while wardecced) and you'll find your beautiful corp withers on the vine and dies.

Boson happened on a gate when these fleets were extracting from the system and have already lost the fight. That boson was just the icing on the cake.

WRT the Moros fit, the one linked in the article seems to be this one: [https://zkillboard.com/kill/67434880/](https://zkillboard.com/kill/67434880/), which runs dual nanopumps and an accelerator for the rigs, rather than 2xT2+xT1 tracking rigs like the Revelation and a previous Moros lossmail.
---
I suppose though that does answer my question, that the better base tracking of the blasters means it's overall a bit better to go for tank rather than application in the rig slots.
---
However with that big cycle time bonus for the armor reps on the hull, I do think that triple nanopumps would probably work out a little bit better, as it provides slightly better cap efficiency, and while a rig does provide a huge cycle time bonus the Moros seems to have a reputation for some significant cap problems.
---
Why, it’s not like he would help the situation any. The supers were idiots. 
---
might be a fault in FCing, but alternatively might be a fault in scouting and intel
---
I remember way back when, under good ol Willam Crane. We were all in a kickout station in SOE space. "Do we have someone undocked who can check the station?" "All clear FC" "Okay everyone hold, I'm going to double check - ah fuck."
---
Point is, sometimes all it takes is one nerd's misinformation.
---
Nah, left diplo, not stripped ... nice spin, though. It's one channel in Legacy Discord. Most skirm FCs have similar access to diplo., but tbh being CEO on SPVG is enough, especially with our growth and RL issues atm. I may dump FC roles, too. I need to get back to having fun in this game again, not be a Discord warrior. Discord Online is a great game, though. I'm pretty sure Bisu was referring to me leaving 'blue donut' Discord.

(Leaving aside Progod reaction,) this actually illustrates that one of the long-held arguments for why people should play Eve is still applicable in TYOOL 2019: that one pilot in a cheap tackle frigate can *possibly* change the circumstances of an entire battle, and could influence the outcome of a coalition conflict.  
---
I don't know who the Punisher is, but it shows the possibility in Eve that a brand newbie in a T1 frigate being in the right place at the right time and doing the right thing might be able to sway a fight, which impacts winning or losing a war, and theoretically the rise and fall of entire space pixel empires.
---
Not sure if this qualifies. I was cleaning out my high sec assets before moving to null space. In my former home I noticed a fortizar in system has unanchored just after DT. Not seeing any members of that Corp in system, I re-tasked my Charon to scoop it. Made away clean with the structure and it’s minimal fitting, about 16 bil iirc.
